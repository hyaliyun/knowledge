The Pollinator Partnership‚Äôs mission of environmental stewardship and pollinator protection is achieved through conservation, policy, education, and research. Signature initiatives include the NAPPC (North American Pollinator Protection Campaign), National Pollinator Week,http://www.pollinator.org/pollinator_week_2009.htm and EcoRegional Planting Guides http://pollinator.org/guides.htm that allow local citizens to plant gardens that provide habitats for important pollinating species. Background and history The Pollinator Partnership was founded as the Coevolution Institute (CoE) in 1997. The early mission of the organization was to promote research, outreach, and education relating to pollinating species and their floral associations. The importance of pollinators has been realized more vividly in recent years. The 1999 Convention on Biological Diversity S√ÉO PAULO DECLARATION ON POLLINATORS http://www.bfn.de/fileadmin/MDB/images/themen/bestaeuber/agr-pollinator- rpt.pdf brought to light both the roles that pollinators play in the daily lives of all human beings and their status as a group of species at risk. Since 1997 P2 has grown and achieved national status as a leader in pollinator conservation. The multifaceted approach of targeting stakeholders ranging from farmers, growers, policy makers, industry, academia, education, and the general public has allowed P2 to launch parallel projects that work towards a common goal ‚Äì protecting and promoting pollinator populations. Partnerships and collaboration P2 has many strong partnerships with institutions, organizations, corporations, and individuals that share a general concern for the conservation of biological diversity and the species that provide essential ecosystem services. The targeted focus on pollinators, however, is unique and is complemented by working relationships and alliances with other conservation institutions. P2 has worked closely with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to develop the EcoRegional Planting Guides. P2's conservation concern is relevant to a subset of the invertebrate species promoted by the Xerces Society. Corporate partnerships with Burt's Bees and H√§agen-Dazs have helped P2 to promote and preserve honey bee populations within the United States through their respective ‚ÄúHoney Bee Health‚Äùhttp://www.burtsbees.com/c/community/community-initiatives/colony- collapse-disorder/ and ‚ÄúHD Loves Honey Bees‚Äù campaigns. P2 has also partnered with food producers and retailers such as Whole Foods Market, World Foods, Wyman's of Maine, and The Great Northern Roasting Company. Scientific advisory panel The conservation work of the Pollinator Partnership is backed by scientific evidence on pollinator decline. Steve Buchmann, Ph.D., co-author of The Forgotten Pollinators,The Forgotten Pollinators, http://www.ecobooks.com/books/pollinat.htm serves as P2's staff scientist. The P2 scientific advisory board includes famed entomologist E.O. Wilson, evolutionary ecologist Daniel Janzen, Ph.D.; entomologist May Berenbaum, Ph.D.; botanist Peter Raven, conservation biologist and president of Stanford's Center for Conservation Biology Paul R.

Its title, which literally means \\"bird\\" in Arabic, is the main protagonist's \\"good luck bird\\" - his late grandfather believed that its arrival symbolized a positive turn of events. Hot (Israel) had already started working on two additional seasons even before the television pilot was aired. Season two began airing on October 17, 2011. Savyon and Amir sold the format to John Wells (of the Warner Bros. fame) in October 2011. The adaptation, named \\"Hard Up\\", will air on FOX. Plot=Season 1 (2010) Motti Amoyal lives on a bus farm in Jerusalem with his three best friends, Itzik, Newton and Katzar. Their lives are about to change drastically as they discover that the land, on which Motti built the farm, holds an enormous debt to city hall because of his late grandfather's past disputes over garbage dumping. The city threatens to repossess the land because of the future profit from zoning plans. Amit Peled, an insurance agent who works for his overly demanding father, accidentally discovers the zoning plans and visits the farm in order to buy it. He arrives there with his girlfriend Shir, who sees Motti and they both recall that they were romantically involved during a trip to India. Upon learning of the zoning plans, the four friends realize that keeping the farm is their chance of redeeming their lives. From that moment on, it becomes a race against time for them. They try every possible scheme, be it working on a taxicab they \\"borrow\\" from the repair shop where Itzik works, laundering the lottery Grand Prize through the black market, stealing from houses, gambling online, selling drugs or even committing armed robbery for a criminal lord. The season's plot mainly revolves around their adventures, as well as the intricately woven relationship between Shir and Motti, along with other romantic complications. Season 2 (2011) Picking up approximately 6 months following the events of season 1, Motti is living with Shir, who by then had divorced Amit and moved to the bus farm, but is inclined to move to Tel Aviv, much to Motti's dismay. Newton returns from his trip to Peru just in time for his aunt's funeral, and Katzar reads a book left at Itzik's apparent death scene, which he sees as a deliberate hint towards Itzik's ruse and encourages everyone to keep their hopes up. Initially skeptic, the three remaining friends decide to embark on a trip to Amsterdam to try and follow Katzar's intuition. Motti remembers an ex-girlfriend, Reli Eugenia, and looks her up on Facebook. Upon seeing her son's picture, he decides to pass through Barcelona (without telling Shir) to find up whether he is the child's father; on the plane, he bumps into Itai, who is now married to Yuli and they have a baby together. After a bumbling attempt for a random search, Newton and Katzar spot Itzik attending a soccer game on TV and notify Motti, who by then reconnects with Reli; she seems happy to see Motti, but denies his paternity of Enrique, her son, due to his romantic involvement with Shir. Encouraged by the news about Itzik, Motti comes to Amsterdam and the three start actively looking for Itzik. Meanwhile, Itzik lives in Marseilles with Juliette, working in her father's winery and desperately trying to win his approval. After a series of failures, Itzik befriends Kika, an Israeli coffee shop owner in Amsterdam, who hooks him up with a series of illegal drug smuggling jobs for an eccentric French-Israeli entrepreneur named Ouliel. Itzik tries to disguise the money he makes as successful wine deliveries, but Juliette's father calls his bluff rather quickly, and Juliette herself discovers the nature of Itzik's endeavors; enraged, she orders him to leave her house and never return. Itzik does so and goes to stay in a hotel; unbeknownst to him, the three friends are in the same hotel, after accidentally getting to Kika's coffee shop, receiving the winery's address from her and subsequently getting no help from Juliette's father. The four reunite in a joyfully tearful manner, but get involuntarily tangled in what turns out to be a failed hit by Mossad agents (including Itai) on a radical Islamic terrorist link when Motti saves Itai from a gunshot. Panicking, they flee the hotel, with Itai critically wounded, and inadvertently become fugitives after the French police discovers the CCTV footage, believing the four to be accomplices. Now on the run, they are detained by Mossad agents, but are quickly intercepted by the Islamists, who manage to steal their passports. Itzik contacts Ouliel, as he believes him to be the best source of help. Incidentally, Ouliel has a business partner named Nassimian, who is a friend of Kobi's and is aware of Kobi's still-ongoing hunt after Itzik. Ouliel initially connects Itzik with an associate of his who issues fake passports, but the Islamists track down his trailer, kill him and wait for the four to return. Kobi, having received information from Nassimian, enters the trailer and is mistakenly shot by the Islamists. The four return and accidentally manage to knock one of the Islamists unconscious, discover the critically wounded Kobi in the trailer and reluctantly decide to drop him off at a nearby hospital. In the hospital, Motti notices sketches of their faces and manages to escape before the police arrives. Having taken the trailer and noticing a small Bar√ßa ball which reminded him of his earlier bonding with Enrique, Motti decides to hide at Reli's hotel. Meanwhile, back in Israel, Shir grows concerned over Motti's absence, and befriends Danny, an archaeologist sent to the bus farm on the behalf of City Hall to search for ancient remains with possible historical value. Danny is a dialysis patient who desperately needs a kidney transplant, and later turns out to be Kika's brother, which also explains her involvement with Ouliel to raise money for Danny's transplant. When Danny is informed of the possibility of a transplant in Israel, Shir accompanies him to the hospital but is surprised to see Yuli there, as the situation arose from Itai's critical condition, and therefore Danny's transplant is in opposite correlation with Itai's chances of survival. Not fully realizing it, Shir stays to support Yuli, and the two reconnect. When Shir tells Yuli about Motti's unexplained absence, Yuli rekindles her detestation of Motti and encourages Shir to move on, possibly with Danny. Itai manages to recover, and the subsequent bad news leaves Kika amidst a dilemma, as the Islamists have requested Ouliel to aid them in finding the four, and Ouliel puts Kika on that mission, promising her the money Danny needs for a transplant in a European hospital. She tells Ouliel that she does not know of their whereabouts, mainly due to her romantic feelings towards Itzik, but contacts them anyway and joins them in their journey to Spain. At the Eugenia hotel, Reli reluctantly agrees to harbor the four. She admits that Enrique is Motti's son, but forbids Motti to visit Enrique, as she is married to Xavier, who has no knowledge of Reli's romantic endeavors in Israel or the fact that Enrique is not his son, and who also turns out to be a police officer. The four are now working at the hotel to pay for their stay; Katzar and Newton, separately, meet two Israeli sisters, who appear to be from a famous rich family. Katzar earlier found out that the aunt that had recently died was his biological mother, who became legally crazy after being raped and spent the rest of her life in a wheelchair; now he tries to win the heart of a wheelchair-bound former model, Anaelle. Newton developed a \\"man crush\\" on a guy named Johnny during his trip to Peru, but Johnny slept with Orly behind his back and both abandoned Newton separately; emasculated by the incident, Newton is trying to imitate Johnny's personality (even introducing himself as \\"Johnny, the musician\\") to impress Anaelle's sister, Tamar. Having lost his cell phone, Motti dials the only number he remembers by heart - his childhood friend Amir, and asks him to tell Shir that he is safe and sound. Shir is relieved, but Yuli, oblivious to Itai's work and thus the whole story, encourages her to think that Motti is acting selfishly; when Itai understands that, he feels he owes Motti his life and tells Shir things are not as they seem. Itai accidentally tells her that Motti flew to Barcelona, and later Shir answers Danny's phone, where Kika tells her she is in Barcelona, and Shir is puzzled whether there is connection. Itai's father reveals that the four might become casualties of Mossad's cover-up of the fiasco, and Itai unsuccessfully pleads him to change it with the higher-ups. Enrique gets attached to Motti, and Xavier starts realizing that Motti is more than a friend to Reli; by a series of deductions, he concludes that Motti is Enrique's father and leaves Reli. Motti unsuccessfully tries talking Xavier out of it at the police station, but manages to snatch a fax with their face sketches that had arrived from the French police. Now believing they need to leave, Motti talks to Gaston, a guest he befriended earlier, and asks him to come to Israel in his yacht.

In Canada, women sentenced to prison terms of greater than two years serve their time in a federal institution operated by the CSC. In Ontario, there is one penitentiary which can house approximately 130 women as of April 2010, though the population has since risen.Institutional Profiles Ontario Region - Grand Valley Institution for Women Grand Valley Institute for Women is now the only federal women's prison in Ontario. History The prison opened in 1997. Previously Prison for Women in Kingston, Ontario was the only federal women's prison in Canada. Area neighbors initially opposed the development due to its location in Kitchener and its proximity to residential areas, but as of 2017 the opposition had died down. The housing for lower security prisoners was built first, and the housing for maximum security prisoners was built later. On October 19, 2007, prison officials at the Grand Valley Institution observed the death of 19-year-old inmate Ashley Smith causing much controversy and legal inquest.Montreal Gazette: Corrections officials withholding dead inmate's records: lawyer Composition The majority of the prisoners live in detached buildings, or \\"cottages\\". The prison has a secure unit for prisoners temporarily held in administrative segregation, who do not communicate with other prisoners, and those classified as maximum security prisoners, who are held in \\"pods\\" which each have five cells. Initially the prison had a white picket fence as a boundary, but a chain-link barbed wire fence later replaced it. Demographics Circa 2017 the prison had 168 prisoners, with most of them each having four or fewer years remaining of their sentences, and 13 of them being classified as maximum security. Four of them had children accompanying them. Circa 2017 the prison had 208 employees.

According to a TalkTalk article, \\"every decade brings a new Brit Pack, another disparate group of actors backed by the media to achieve simultaneous Hollywood stardom.\\" However, the term is most closely associated with the crop of English actors that emerged in the late 1980s, because of the prominence of the American Brat Pack actors at that time. History In November 1986, Journalist Elissa Van Poznak conducted an interview with Colin Firth, Spencer Leigh, Paul McGann, Bruce Payne and Tim Roth for the January 1987 edition of The Face. Daniel Day-Lewis and Gary Oldman were also invited, but were unable to attend due to acting obligations (although Oldman gave his own interview at a later date). The title of the article was \\"The Brit Pack\\": this moniker stuck and has been referenced in subsequent pieces regarding actors from that period.Stern, Marlow. \\"Gary Oldman Talks 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,' 'Batman' Retirement\\". The Daily Beast. 8 December 2011. Retrieved 21 December 2018. In the February 1988 issue of Film Comment, Harlan Kennedy stated that Day-Lewis and Oldman, along with Rupert Everett and Miranda Richardson, were the \\"pack-leaders\\". According to a retrospective article by Marlow Stern in The Daily Beast, the British press anointed Oldman \\"de facto ringleader\\" of the Brit Pack. Unlike the Brat Pack or other similarly defined groups of American actors, Brit Pack actors rarely associated with each other socially or in film. Harlan Kennedy wrote that the group \\"aren't seen together at parties or in restaurants or in gossip columns. And since British cinema has had no equivalent to Hollywood's Eighties conveyor-belt youth movies ‚Äì Weird Science, About Last Night..., St. Elmo's Fire, et al. ‚Äì they don't keep re-meeting each other on-screen either\\". A July 1993 article in The Face was titled \\"The New Brit Pack\\", which included Naveen Andrews, Jaye Davidson, Craig Kelly, Jude Law, Rufus Sewell, David Thewlis and Samuel West. In later years, the phrase 'Brit Pack' has been used to describe disparate groups of young English actors of rising prominence.

Now deconsecrated, it was a church of the Church of Ireland located on St Mary's Place, Broadstone, Dublin. It is constructed from local calp limestone which takes on a dark hue when wet. This is the origin of the building's nickname. A chapel of ease is a church building, other than a parish church, that is located within the bounds of a parish for the convenience of those who cannot conveniently reach the main church. The parish's main church, now also deconsecrated, was St Mary's on Mary Street. History The ground for the church was donated by the Viscount Mountjoy. The church was built in 1830 to designs by John Semple of the Board of First Fruits. He was given many contracts by patron Archbishop McGee, during an intense building period when both denominations vied for control of the population. Amongst the striking features of the church is how the interior is constructed. There are no interior walls but instead the exterior walls are arched towards the ceiling to create an interior of a large parabolic vault. It was the culmination of a series of designs which Semple constructed around Dublin and countrywide over a 12-year period. As you view his work in year-on- year progression, the ideas develop and become more refined. For example, what began as a simple cross type motif over the main door, eventually became the fully expanded Semple 'Rose' window. The main door-way itself became one of his 'trademark' features, a tall, ovoidal gothic multi-leaved entrance. Today, surrounded by paved streets, the striking building looms over onlookers. The church was deconsecrated in 1962. After extensive modern refurbishment, is now occupied as offices. Legend Local lore says that you will summon the devil if you run around the church anticlockwise three times at midnight. Literary references The Black Church is mentioned briefly in the novel Ulysses by Irish author James Joyce, in the chapter entitled 'Circe', as the location of one of Bloom's many sins: He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Joyce lived for a few months in 1909-10 only yards from the Church in Broadstone, at 44 Fontenoy Street, one of the Joyce family's many temporary homes around Dublin. He stayed there with his son Giorgio from July to September 1909 and again alone from October 1909 to June 1910 while trying to set up the first cinema in Dublin. It was the favourite Church of English poet Sir John Betjeman and the Dubliner Austin Clarke. Clarke mentions the local legend of ‚ÄòOld Nick‚Äô appearing in his 1962 autobiography titled Twice Round the Black Church.

Chelsie, and Kuesu Jinguji (bottom row). The manga and anime series Omamori Himari features an extensive cast of characters by Milan Matra. The series' storyline focuses on Yuto Amakawa, an orphan who, on the day of his sixteenth birthday, meets Himari, a buxom sword-wielding girl and a cat spirit. Yuto later learns that he is a Demon Slayer and that his family is one of the twelve Demon Slayer families that had slain demons for hundreds of years, and that Himari had sworn an oath set by their ancestors to protect him until his powers awaken. Throughout the series, Yuto, along with his childhood friend Rinko, later encounter other girls who soon take a liking to Yuto: Shizuku, a mizuchi, Lizlet, an artifact spirit and Kuesu Jinguji, an heiress to the Jinguji Family of Demon Slayers who is revealed to be Yuto's fianc√©e. Main characters ; : :Yuto is the male protagonist of the series. He is a student at Touryou High School in Takamiya City, and is the sole descendant of the , one of the twelve Demon Slayer families who had fought and slain ayakashi for hundreds of years. His parents died in a car crash when he was eight years old and he fell into a deep depression when he arrived in Takamiya until Rinko helped him out of it. He also has a terrible cat allergy, which would cause his eyes to water and his nose to run as well as causing him to sneeze uncontrollably whenever he is near one (revealed to be Kuesu's doing, but later when Kuesu dies from Shuten- douji's fatal attack, she purifies Yuto. As a result, Yuto's no longer allergic to cats). :Yuto spent most of his childhood with his grandparents in Noihara, and shared a close bond with Himari when she was a cat. He also had a close friendship with Kuesu Jinguji, who would later be his fianc√©e. However, due to the strong protection spell placed in the amulet that his grandmother gave to him (an omamori), most of his childhood memories were erased, though they were later regained after his visit to his grandparents' home and his reunion with Kuesu. He is usually portrayed with a friendly and caring demeanor, but he can be shy and nervous in perverted situations or harem acts, most of the time with Himari. Yuto has also been shown to be acrophobic, which resulted from his childhood when he tried to climb a tree to get to Himari only for him to fall each time and when he fell from a cliff one night during his walk home, at which he suffered some physical trauma after Himari passed out using her demon powers to call for help. Upon learning of his family's Demon Slayer heritage, he is initially dismayed, repeatedly declaring that he has no intention of fighting. This later changes after he witnesses Himari's demon side in Noihara and during the Christmas Eve incident followed by Shuten-douji and Tama's appearance, as he soon realizes that he needs to start fighting to preserve his way of peace, thus prompting him to officially accept his Demon Slayer mantle. :As a descendant of the Amakawa Family, Yuto has the power of the , an ability that imbues ordinary objects (such as a pole or twig) with light-based energy, turning them into powerful melee weapons equivalent to that of a legendary blade. He can also imbue other weapons, shield himself from harm, and enhance his physical senses with it, one instance is when he imbued Himari's Yasutsuna to defeat Shuten-douji.Omamori Himari anime; Episode 12: \\"Cats, Yuto, and a Maiden's Pure Heart\\" He can also use it to trap other enemies as well as explained by Hitsugi, once doing so against Tesuma. In order for him to control the Light Ferry, Yuto must keep a calm mind and have good composure. Prior to having some control over it, the Light Ferry ability only emerged when Yuto was in a near-death situation. Although the Amakawa Family is a higher-ranking family, they were not well liked by the other Demon Slayer families due to their association with ayakashi. In addition, the Light Ferry power has only been descended to the male half of the family. ; : : :Himari is a bakeneko, a shapeshifting demon cat, and the female protagonist of the series. She appears to Yuto as his bodyguard to protect him from the ayakashi out of an ancient oath set by her ancestor, who was spared by one of the Amakawa's heads after he refused to kill her. She is known to other ayakashi as the due to her expert swordsmanship, and refers to herself as the Yuto. She is usually seen wearing traditional Japanese clothes (when not in her school uniform) and always wears her hair in a long ponytail with a large pink bow to hold it in place, and uses keigo in her speech. She is very close to Yuto, whom she refers to as , and is sometimes philosophical, worried that Yuto will kill her when his abilities awaken. However she is deeply in love with him, as she wants to be with him as a person, and is very flirtatious with him because she and Yuto got along well in Noihara in the past when she was a white cat. This flirting often annoys Rinko to no end. In the anime, Himari is one of the only people to have kissed Yuto (the other being Kuesu). Despite this, she is also very serious about her duty as a bodyguard, and is willing to protect Yuto from harm by any means. :In the final episode of anime series, Himari voluntarily gives her heart in to the darkness inside of her to fight Tama at her full strength, assuming a demonic form called . Aside from the physical changes (white hair, pale skin with black markings, red claws, and a bushier tail), Himari also gains the ability to perform powerful claw swipes from a distance in addition to her increased demon powers, but the loss of her personality makes her a deadly killing machine, unable to distinguish friend from foe. After she was restored by Yuto and Shuten-d≈çji assumes his Oni form, Yuto imbues her Yasutsuna with his Light Ferry ability, allowing her to assume a powered-up form called , which consists of her wearing revealing samurai-like garments. As Super Himari, she gains the ability of levitation and can slice the strongest of demons in two with a single blow. :As a bakeneko, Himari can shapeshift from human to cat (the latter in which she can also talk in) and she can also reveal her cat ears and tail while in her human form (though this triggers Yuto's allergies while doing so). She also has superhuman speed, strength, and endurance (all of which surpasses Rinko, who was the school's top athlete prior, and she is extremely agile due to her cat-like nature. She is armed with , a katana crafted in the Heian period that was handed down to her by Yuto's grandfather and the legendary blade that defeated Shuten-douji in the past, and is almost never seen without it (its blade was burned in chapters 18‚Äì29 of the manga and episodes 7‚Äì10 of the anime following her duel with Kuesu). Himari is also proficient with other bladed weapons as well, once using a scythe against Ageha in the anime, and she is also skilled in close- range combat. Because she is a cat, however, she shares some of their natural instincts as well, such as having a fear of water (Rinko speculates that Himari is afraid of deep water, water in quantity), a penchant for seafood, and being very sensitive to winter temperatures. Also, due to her ayakashi nature, she becomes weakened whenever she is near a Shinto shrine (to the point where even a thrown stone can knock her out instantly, as shown by Rinko during the summer festival). :When Himari loses her sanity during a fight, she goes on a berserker rampage, which is depicted by her having red eyes, an uncontrollable bloodlust, and (in the anime only) a dark aura surrounding her body. Also, Himari loses all rational thought, becoming a mindless killing machine bent on hunting and killing anything that moves, which Shizuku states is part of her kind's true nature. Shizuku also warns Yuto that there is a much higher risk of Himari reverting to her kind's killer instincts should she continue to fight. Rinko's nickname for Himari is , while Shizuku and Kuesu simply refer to her as (or in Kuesu's case, \\"Demon Cat\\"). ; : :Rinko is Yuto's tomboyish childhood friend and next-door neighbor. She had a very close friendship with Yuto, as she helped him out of his depression when he first moved to Takamiya and cried along with him when his parents died. She also has feelings for Yuto until Himari and the other girls appeared, causing her to display a tsundere personality as a result of their constant flirting. She also suffers from an inferiority complex from their well-endowed breasts (sans Shizuku). She is also a remarkable athlete, excelling at nearly every sport at her school. :Rinko always tends to ruin every romantic or perverted moment Yuto has with another girl by hitting him with her signature nail bat (or any other object she could find) despite the fact that he had nothing to do with it in the first place. However, despite all of this, she still wants to support Yuto to the very end even if he does become a full-fledged Demon Slayer, believing that she is the only person good for him due to their long relationship and that all he ever wanted was a normal life. Rinko is always seen wearing two red ribbons in her hair; a tradition involving them is that, every year during a summer festival, Yuto would buy her a new pair for her to wear year round and she would tie last year's ribbons to a treebranch. She owns a pet cat named . ; : :Shizuku is a mizuchi, a water deity (traditionally depicted as a dragon) who is introduced in chapter 5 of the manga (she had a brief cameo in chapter 3 prior). She assumes the form of a green-haired child with red eyes, looking like a drowning victim just pulled out of the water, abnormally pale, cold to the touch and dripping wet,In chapter 24, when Shizuku appeared out of a lake during a class art trip, one of the students pointed out that she bears a resemblance to Sadako Yamamura from the Ring Trilogy and has a cold-fish personality to match her appearance. Her demeanor can quickly change to a murderous grin when her desire to kill emerges. She first appears to Yuto at a nearby lake in the forest where Himari was killing other ayakashi, warning him to deviate from his Demon Slayer heritage or face death, and then disappearing. Later on, after witnessing Yuto's resolve to save Himari from her water whirlpool during her fight with the latter, she becomes puzzled about him and, in an attempt to understand him more, invites herself to live in his house, flirting with him on multiple occasions. She is shown to have developed feelings for Yuto and also tends to show signs of jealousy when another girl flirts with him. Her family was killed by the Jibashiri Family of Demon Slayers 100 years prior to the series' start, and she bears a grudge against them as a result. However, she lets go of it following an intervention from Yuto and Himari after meeting one of their descendants. She often ends her sentences with , and her name is a homonym for a drop of water (albeit with different Kanji). :As a mizuchi, Shizuku can manipulate water and ice and use it as a weapon or a shield, even using it to heal the wounds of others, once doing so with Yuto after Himari's battle with Ageha. However, if the water is mixed, such as with another ayakashi's blood, she cannot control it. She can also regenerate her body after being sliced in two, and her hair extends whenever her desire to kill emerges. She is also very sensitive to variations in temperature, as she is cold-blooded, and needs to cool down in the summer by eating shaved ice or other frozen treats and needs to warm up in the winter by staying in warm places (such as hiding in a kotatsu). She can also extend her snake-like tongue to abnormal lengths. She claims that her kind were excellent housekeepers prior to the Demon Slayers' arrival, and as a result is very adept at cooking and cleaning. She is often referred to as \\"lolita snake\\", \\"Loli-snake\\", or simply \\"snake\\" by other female characters, namely Rinko, Himari, and Kuesu. ;, nicknamed : :Lizlet is a tsukumogami, an inanimate object that comes to life, who first appeared in chapter 8 of the manga.Liz made a cameo appearance at the end of chapter 7, passing out flyers while Yuto and Himari were in town Her true form is an antique teacup, while she frequently appears as a busty blonde girl with blue eyes wearing a maid's outfit. She came to Japan from Britain (specifically, Edinburgh) a hundred years ago, and works as a waitress at , a popular maid caf√© where she also resides in an apartment on the building's second floor. Liz is a self-proclaimed \\"Tea Sprite\\" due to her expertise with it (to the extent of having a garden that contains numerous types of tea leaves) and adheres to the maids' code of conduct. When Liz got suspicious of Yuto's constant watching during his first visit to the caf√©, she believed that he was an exorcist trying to kill her with Himari as his accomplice. Fearing for her life, she spiked his tea with poisonous tea leaves, which was soon foiled by Shizuku tasting it (in the anime, it makes whoever drinks it to leave her caf√©). After her true identity was discovered during her fight with Himari, she tried to protect her real body from breaking but failed to recover it after Himari lost her grip on it until Yuto caught it at the last minute, saving her. Soon after the misunderstanding was cleared, Liz took an intense liking to Yuto and fell in love with him, seeing him as her \\"significant other\\" and \\"Master\\" (to the others' annoyance), and flirts with him every time he comes to visit. Later on, she suggests that she starts serving him \\"Milk Tea\\", in which she hugs her breasts every time she says it, suggesting she means her breast milk. She has a pacifist nature and gets intimidated easily when she sees someone powerful, often resulting in her being the series' comic relief. :Liz can use her magic tea leaves to attack her opponents as well as defend herself when needed, and is shown to have feats of superhuman strength, once managing to throw Yuto at a very high altitude without much stress during his \\"training session\\". Because her human body is an illusion, she is immune to any damage caused by a bladed weapon, where it would just regenerate at the site of damage (her body, not her clothes). She can also teleport from a limited range as long as her teacup is present. However, because Liz's human body is symbiotic to her real body, she feels whatever the teacup is feeling, meaning that if the teacup breaks, her human body will also suffer the same fate. This was demonstrated in one of the manga's side chapters when Himari rubs and licks her teacup while she was sleeping, causing Liz to feel the same effects as a result, and in another side chapter when Yuto (mistakenly) drinks from her teacup, giving Liz the feeling of having Cunnilingus. ; : :Kuesu is the heiress of the , a Demon Slayer family that uses Western dark magic, who made her first appearance in chapter 15 of the manga. She is Yuto's fianc√©e, claiming that both of their families had promised their future marriage, and dresses in gothic lolita fashion. She is condescending towards ayakashi and, unlike Yuto, is fully trained in her Demon Slayer heritage. She is very arrogant and haughty as a result of her upbringing, and is shown to be highly aggressive and assertive, once kissing Yuto twice in front of Himari during her debut to stake her claim. She also has an enduring rivalry with Himari over Yuto, which stems from their first encounter in Noihara when she told Himari to stay away from him, and made Yuto allergic to cats with her magic so Himari couldn't get close to him. Prior to leaving for England to study magic, she and Yuto made a promise together to fight ayakashi, which was forgotten due to the magic in Yuto's amulet. Like the other girls, she, too has feelings for Yuto, but due to him befriending ayakashi, which to her is contradictory to his duties as a Demon Slayer, she often displays yandere traits. She slowly begins to accept the ayakashi siding with Yuto as her comrades, though this does not change her views about them should they betray him. :Kuesu is on unfriendly terms with the other Demon Slayer families, as her family was looked down upon by them and the ayakashi as heretics and outcasts for using Western magic. The only Demon Slayer family that didn't look down to them, however, was the Amakawa Family. Because they were one of the higher-ranking families, the Jinguji Family tried to make allies with them through marriage (even Himari speculates it as a well-thought idea). One of Kuesu's notable features is the crescent-shaped mark on her forehead, similar to the one that often appears on Sailor Moon's Usagi Tsukino. Because of this and her relentless killing of ayakashi, she is given the infamous title of . She also gained some infamous nicknames such as , , and . Another notable feature is her silver hair: originally black, it changed color while she was studying abroad in England as a result of being exposed to and absorbing all the knowledge of a forbidden tome containing infinite knowledge (another student had pretended to befriend her in order to use her to gain the forbidden knowledge for herself and her sect; Kuesu gained the knowledge, but all of the sect members were either killed or lost their souls in the process).Omamori Himari manga; Volume 0 The reason the tome was forbidden is that everyone else who tried to acquire the knowledge it contained died from various reasons, such as their heads exploding. :As a descendant of the Jinguji Family, Kuesu can cast various magic spells through her spellbook, though she can easily cast these spells without it. During their fight, she told Himari after losing her spellbook (Himari had made a grave error in believing that the book was the source of her magic) that her spellbook didn't act as a talisman or focus to enable or enhance her spells, but was in fact a limiter to decrease her enormous power (so she would do less damage to the area such as making just a small crater where her target stood as opposed to wiping out most of the hill they were on). She also has the ability to teleport and wields a Stechkin APS machine pistol loaded with magic bullets as her personal sidearm. Similar to the Amakawa Family's power, the Jinguji Family's dark magic has only been passed down to female members of the family. Ayakashi are the demons and spirits based on Japanese mythology and folklore. They once coexisted with the humans until the Demon Slayers arrived and killed most of them. As a result, the surviving ayakashi bear a deep hatred towards the Demon Slayers. Some ayakashi, like Himari and Shizuku, can assume human forms to blend in with society (though Himari comments that most do not like human cities), and some ayakashi can cast barriers and spells using their . Among the ayakashi are three powerful ayakashi known as , consisting of Shuten-douji, Tama, and Emperor Sutoku, the latter who has yet to appear in the series. They were sealed by humans in ancient times and parts of them were spread throughout Japan in fragments until it was broken by Tama's awakening and Shuten-d≈çji's revival. It remains unclear if Emperor Sutoku has been freed after the seal was broken. Although the majority of ayakashi in Omamori Himari serve as antagonists, there are some who serve as allies. Major ayakashi ; : :Known by her pet name , she is a golden nine-tailed fox and the main antagonist of the series. First appearing in chapter 28 of the manga, assuming the guise of a small child, she is a very powerful ayakashi despite her appearance. Because she is not as powerful as she was before she was sealed, she eats other ayakashi to restore her y≈çkai powers and seems to have an insatiable appetite for them, once devouring an entire countryside of them in her first appearance. When she first tried to eat Himari (to be specific, her breasts), she states that she wasn't delicious because she was holding back her true nature, and as such, sends numerous ayakashi in an attempt to compel Himari to show her true power, which almost succeeded during the Christmas Eve fight. She is portrayed as a quiet girl who rarely speaks, having Shuten-d≈çji speak for her on most occasions, and is always seen eating something, be it another ayakashi or some sweets. In the anime, she is defeated by Himari in her ayakashi form but survives and is last seen in Yuto's house eating lunch with the other girls. :Tama has the ability to levitate, use telekinesis to move large objects or trap her opponents, and can generate force fields powerful enough to break a single sword on impact. In chapters 40-43 of the manga, she assumes an adult form (later revealed to be her true form in a later chapter according to her conversation with Rinko) while Yuto and the others were temporarily residing in a ski resort owned by Kofuyu, where she showed a sexual interest in Yuto. She is significantly more powerful in this form and is able to generate large amounts of y≈çki enough to overpower Himari and the others, though because of her current state she is vulnerable to powerful attacks, such as the case with Himari through the teamwork of Yuto and the others. :In chapter 62 after witnessing Shuten-douji's death, she goes on a full rampage, which eventually backfires after Himari consumes almost all her power. Eventually, it is revealed that due to either Himari consuming Tama's powers or due to the shock of witnessing Himari's true form, she lost all her memories and her mind reverted to an infantile state. :In the anime when she changes into her full fox form, a large ring with nine smaller rings appears around her neck, with the flame inside of each ring representing the number of tails she has. She does not take such a form in the manga (as of Volume 10), instead taking on a form similar to Himari's, sporting fox ears and nine tails.Tama briefly assumes this form in the last episode of the anime in her final dual against Himari. ; : :A powerful Oni ruler from ancient times who met his end by Minamoto no Raik≈ç at ≈åeyama (according to legend, he was tricked into drinking some poison sake, then was beheaded by Minamoto's sword, Yasutsuna). He swears vengeance against the human race following this incident after he was awakened by Tama's y≈çki, and is condescending towards them as a result, finding them in modern times weak and pathetic. Because he is incomplete, he uses Tama's y≈çki from the ayakashi she devours to help regain his power so he can have his revenge. Appearing as a well-dressed young man, he is a very powerful demon that is agile and fast enough to sense the presence of incoming attacks. Tama is usually seen riding on his shoulder and he usually does most of the talking for her. He also has a tendency to chat with his enemies during fights. :In the anime after Tama was defeated by Himari's ayakashi form, he planned to use Himari to put the human race in a state of fear, only to have that foiled when Yuto brought her back to normal and soon met his end by being incapacitated and sliced in two by Super Himari after he assumed his Oni form. :In the manga, he faces Kuesu in a one-on-one duel, which ended with him fatally injuring her but ends up losing his physical body in the process after receiving a powerful blast from the latter. He later appears in his spiritual form, taking a fatal blow from Himari that was meant for Tama and telling Tama to retreat and they will meet each other again before disappearing. Minor ayakashi ; : :A Zashiki-warashi who lives at and looks after Yuto's grandparents' house. She is very fond of Himari, as she once lived with her when Yuto's grandparents were alive, but does not like Yuto due to the fact that she is very jealous of him and blames him for Himari leaving her. She is usually seen either cleaning up the house or reading books and scrolls in the storehouse. Kaya once provided Shizuku with the Amakawa's family records, which held information about the family itself and Himari's ancestors, at the latter's request, and (in the anime only) provided Yuto and Rinko brief information about Shuten-d≈çji and Tama's origins. She can generate a force field around herself and other people in her vincitiy to repel enemy attacks.Omamori Himari anime; Episode 11: \\"Himari, as a Bodyguard\\"Omamori Himari anime; Episode 4: \\"The White Cat of Noihara\\" Starting from chapter 56, she joins the fight against Tama in the appearance of a ninja. ; : :A , who feeds off the blood of men like a vampire, who attempted to kill Yuto and Himari in Noihara in chapters 10‚Äì12 of the manga. However, after Yuto is seriously wounded by her with an attack that was meant for Himari, she is almost killed by the latter during her demon rampage until Yuto intervened with the awakening of the Light Ferry. After the incident, she begins to display tsundere traits (Rinko speculates that her current situation is similar to Shizuku's, in which she loses the intent to kill Yuto but still goes after him) and later reappears in chapter 24 to kidnap Yuto and drink his blood under a bridge. However, she found herself so intoxicated by it that she actually tried to violate him until Himari and Shizuku intervened. After Sasa stops the fight at Rinko's request, she leaves with him, but not before warning Yuto that she will drink his blood next time. :In the anime adaptation, she becomes a supporting character following Shuten-d≈çji and Tama's appearance. Her anime incarnation portrays her as being more perverse towards Yuto following their first encounter in Noihara, as she once made Yuto grope her breasts during their second encounter, dressed in a revealing schoolgirl outfit in an attempt to awaken Yuto's powers (which was an idea of hers), and once attempted to drink Yuto's blood while the latter was sleeping only to find that he was outside with Himari (which she says is a euphemism for sex). :Ageha's main outfit is modelled after those worn by mikos, with the addition of wearing boots and a beret-like hat. During her second appearance in Takamiya, she swaps her miko outfit for modern-day clothing, wearing a violet tube top underneath a tan jacket, a miniskirt, silver and black boots, and violet sunglasses. She can stretch her limbs to unimaginable lengths and hypnotize her victims with her eyes. She can increase her powers by drinking the blood of a Demon Slayer, but the blood itself must have enough time to mix in properly; if she uses too much power while it is still mixing, she will be paralyzed for a short period, such as the case during her fight with Himari when the latter was turned into a child. She wields a single-edged sword modeled after a kunai as her personal weapon, which was broken in the anime by Tama's force field when Himari wielded it. ; : :An , a monopedal cyclops-like demon that lives in mountains. He is Ageha's accomplice that attacked Shizuku, Kaya, and Rinko at Yuto's grandparents' house, but was defeated and captured by Shizuku. In his second appearance, he assumes a bipedal form with androgynous features. After Rinko took him out to eat ice cream at Caf√© Relish, he stopped the fight between Ageha and Himari at her request. Sasa can summon giant pillars from the sky to crush his opponents, increase his mass at will, and fire energy beams from his eye. However, because of his androgynous appearance, he is originally mistaken for a girl, especially since in Chapter 24 he is wearing a skirt (according to him, trousers would interfere with his changing back into his monopedal form). It is mentioned by Ageha in the anime that his kind are excellent swordsmiths and as such, can repair and restore broken swords to their original condition and strength. :Sasa's anime incarnation portrays him as bipedal and his gender has been changed to a girl. Also, like Ageha, he/she becomes a supporting character following Shuten-d≈çji and Tama's appearance, and plays a key role in restoring Himari's Yasutsuna by shooting it with his/her eye, something that was originally done by Kuesu in the manga by recreating it through some sort of time magic. ; :A Kasha, a cat- like monster that steals and devours the corpses of criminals, with his human form bearing a strong resemblance to L Lawliet from Death Note. Appearing in chapter 16 of the manga when he rescues Shizuku from her fight with Kuesu, he becomes Yuto, Himari and Shizuku's informant. He is one of the monsters that likes to be an ally to Yuto due to his kindness, leading to a time that he once killed an ayakashi for Yuto right after Yuto awakened his Light Ferry power, saying that Yuto was not yet ready to fight monsters. Aside from his human form bearing a physical resemblance to \\"L\\", he also has the same personality as the latter, being calm, smart, having good composure, and being quiet most of the time. His name means \\"Shadow Moon\\". ; : :A , a spirit messenger, working under Kaya's wing. Her original form is a magical envelope that can be used to summon her in her human form, which consists of her having long blue hair with matching eyes wearing a long light blue yukata. She makes her first appearance in chapter 21 of the manga when Himari was looking for a replacement weapon from Noihara's weapon vault, having lost Yasutsuna during her battle with Kuesu, and again in Kuesu's hotel room after the field set around the hotel was broken when the latter was pushed back towards the window by Yuto's Light Ferry powers, vomiting out numerous weapons for Himari to use. Aya can store multiple objects inside her stomach, a sort of hammerspace, and regurgitate them when necessary to the disgust of anyone who witnesses it. She also appears to have taken a liking to Yuto, having teased him in the pool chapter of Volume 0 and in Chapter 64 after Kuesu's supposed death. ; :A Yuki- onna who works at a ski resort. She invited Yuto and the girls to her ski resort to stop Tama, as she, like Yuto, wanted humans and ayakashi to coexist. It is revealed that two years prior to the series, the ski resort's owner (and his wife) found her unconscious during a mild winter and nursed her back to health. She has also taken quite a liking to Yuto, once flirting with him in an onsen underneath the ski lodge and referring to him as \\"Yuto-sama\\". As a Yuki-onna, she can control ice and snow and use it to trap her opponents, once doing so against Tama in her adult form. Her name means \\"Little Winter\\", in reference to her ayakashi species. ; :A Tensh≈ç-sagari working under Tama. She specializes in firearms, having used a SIG Sauer P220 and a NeoStead shotgun. According to her, she was murdered by a stalker and her body hidden inside a refrigerator in an attic; the police seem to have listed her as an unsolved case and her body has never to date been recovered. ; :A Jor≈çgumo working under Tama. Light novel ayakashi ; :A who appears in volume 1 of the light novels. ; :A wolf spirit who appears in volume 2 of the light novels. She made a brief cameo appearance in chapter 44 of the manga at Yuto's grandparents' house. ; :A swordswoman who appears in volume 4 of the light novels. Other ayakashi ; : :A spider demon that possessed Taizo and attacked Yuto and Rinko on the school rooftop. Himari managees to expel it from Taizo's body before she kills it by impaling it in front of a water tower. During its possession, Taizo's skin turns blue, numerous leg-like projections protrude from his body, and he gains the ability to fire energy spheres. It is an anime-exclusive ayakashi, as its spider form was never shown in the manga, only appearing as a floating mass of fog that was killed in a similar fashion by Himari.Omamori Himari anime; Episode 1: \\"Cat and Girl and Allergy\\" ; : :A giant ayakashi that aided Ageha in attacking Yuto and Himari in Noihara. It was later incapacitated by Himari in her demon rampage before it was finally destroyed by the energy produced from Yuto's Light Ferry. In the manga, it is revealed that it was apparently not destroyed, as Sasa mentions in chapter 26 that \\"Daidarabotchi sends his regards\\". ; :A mantis- like ayakashi who appeared in chapters 38-39 of the manga, assuming the guise of a man wearing sunglasses and a trenchcoat. He sided with Tama so he can witness \\"the world she is about to create\\", and was sent out to attack Himari as well as to see Yuto's Light Ferry power. He can turn his left hand into a mantis' sickle to slice his opponents and wields an H&K; USP pistol as his personal sidearm. His sickle arm was sliced by Himari after he was distracted by Yuto's Light Ferry trap before he was finally killed off by Hitsugi's wire trap after he attempted to escape. ; :An , a spirit with the body of a tree stump and dead treebranches for arms, who appeared in chapter 42 of the manga. He is the leader of the ayakashi that are residing in the ski resort. He makes a brief appearance in the anime as a minor character, being part of a mob of ayakashi attempting to kill Yuto. ; :A Futakuchi-onna who appeared in the Book of the Gaiden side manga. ; :A bakeneko who appeared in the Book of the Gaiden side manga. Demon Slayers are humans with supernatural powers and abilities with the duty to slay ayakashi, which has been their primary purpose for hundreds of years. The Demon Slayers were established by the feudal lords who opposed the ayakashi and because of this, most of the surviving ayakashi bear a grudge against them for their near-extinction. The Demon Slayers consist of twelve families, each family having their own unique powers and abilities, such as the Amakawa Family with their Light Ferry ability and the Jinguji Family with their dark magic. Out of the twelve families in feudal times, less than half of the families remain in existence in present times. Each Demon Slayer family is sorted by rank, with the Jinguji Family being at the bottom (#12) and the Tsuchimikado Family at the top (#1). ; :A bespectacled member of the , a Demon Slayer family coming from a long line of onmy≈çji trailing from Abe no Seimei. He made a cameo appearance in chapter 34 of the manga and made his full appearance in chapter 51, where he reveals that he has met Yuto once in Norihara prior to the latter moving away to Takamiya. It is also revealed that he is not the true leader, merely acting as a stand- in for his sick father. ; :Mikari is a descendant of the (it has been stated by Kuesu that her family name has changed) and Kuesu's friend who appeared in chapters 31‚Äì33 of the manga. Her Jibashiri ancestors channeled the power of the Earth, giving them superhuman strength. They were later wiped out in the front lines of the Great War, but there are a few descendants like her (those without their powers) that survived. Her ancestors were also responsible for killing Shizuku's family 100 years prior to the series' start. Kuesu brought her out so that Shizuku could have her revenge, which almost succeeded hadn't it been for Yuto and Himari intervening. Before leaving after the fight ended with Shizuku letting go of her grudge, she states that she would be on Yuto's side should her powers emerge. ; :Kasuri is the Demon Slayer of the , a family that uses Shinto magic to seal ayakashi within mirrors, and is known to be the only Demon Slayer family to do so. She is a miko of the Kagamimori Shrine, and have met Himari and Kaya in the past when they visited their shrine prior to the series' start. Despite her young age (18 years), her way of speaking is reminiscent to that of an old lady's, as pointed out by Hitsugi and Himari. In chapter 52, she used her Shinto magic to reveal Himari's malicious side from her body and seal it, but her plan backfired when Himari's malicious side broke free from the mirror and merged with Himari. :As the head of the Kagamimori Family, Kasuri possesses the , which is located in her left eye. Her family name translates to \\"mirror forest\\", in reference to her family's ability. ; :Kasuri's younger sister. She is sometimes hot-blooded and arrogant, often requiring Kasuri to calm her down. Like most of the Demon Slayer families, she looks down to the Kuesu and her family. She specializes in advanced martial arts, and (according to Hitsugi) has killed fifteen ayakashi with her skills alone. She seems to have yuri-esque feelings for her older sister. ; :Hitsugi is the detective-like Demon Slayer of the , a family that has the ability to analyze and gather information quicker than a normal human, which Himari states is similar to having the ability of seeing into the future. However, it causes sensory overload from the loss of brain cells, causing many of them to die as a result. She made her debut appearance in chapter 38 of the manga when she aided Yuto during his training session with Himari by predicting her oncoming moves. She was after Tesuma of the Sentoro, using Yuto and Himari as bait to lure him out so she can kill him through a series of wire traps set up in the forest. After his defeat, she told Himari that she will eventually die. She gets a visit from Kuesu at her office in chapter 40, eventually telling the latter that she is looking down on Yuto and the others and mentioning her and her family's lust for power. It remains unclear what her current intentions are at this point. ; :A member of the Tsuchimikado family. ; :A member of the Tsuchimikado family. ; :Kuesu's mother who also inherited the Jinguji Family's dark magic. She was introduced as an unseen character in chapter 16 in a telephone conversation with her daughter, and has made regular (albeit voiceless) appearances since then. She made her first physical appearance in chapter 56, unlocking her daughter's power limiter in preparation for her fight against Shuten-douji. ; and : :Yuto's grandparents that lived in Noihara and Himari's caretakers, with Gennosuke being a Demon Slayer in his younger days before he retired. Prior to Yuto moving to Takamiya with his parents, Sawako gave him an omamori which, unknown to the latter at the time, had a magic spell that hid his Demon Slayer presence from the ayakashi until his sixteenth birthday, and Gennosuke was the one who bestowed Yasutsuna to Himari prior to his death. Yuto later revisits their house with Himari and the others and, upon seeing their tombstone, pays his respects to them, not realizing they were dead due him being separated from them by his parents. Himari refers to them as and \\"Grandma Sawa\\" respectively. Other characters ; : :A bespectacled classmate at Yuto's school and the class representative of Yuto's class. She has been shown to get along well with Yuto and Rinko (albeit the fact she has larger breasts than the latter), and often jokes around with them when it comes to romantic topics, especially their close relationship with each other. She is also shown to be an otaku, once doing a witch cosplay at the school festival and playing video games in her free time. Like Rinko, she, too, does not tolerate Taizo's pervertedness, which was shown in one chapter when she, along with Rinko, drowned him for attempting to peep at girls underwater. She apparently knows about the existience of the Demon Slayers, as shown in her research on Kuesu. She, along with her mother, were later put under Tama's control in Chapter 50, though Rinko manages to snap her out it in chapter 58. Her real name (which was not revealed until Chapter 49) is derived from voice actress Y≈´ Shimamura who voiced her in the anime. ;In page 13 of volume 1 of the English manga, Taizo's name was erroneously misspelled as \\"Kaitou\\". : :Yuto's best friend and classmate. He is a shameless pervert who is attracted to almost any beautiful girl he sees, often resulting in him getting beat up for his actions. He is attracted to Himari as well as Shizuku, one time asking Himari to be his model for his art sketch only to be rejected to his disappointment and when he convinces both of them to be contestants in a swimsuit pageant he organized at the school festival.Omamori Himari anime; Episode 10: \\"The Meow in the Approaching Darkeness\\" ; : :Kaburagi is a secretary working for , a secret government department whose purpose is to investigate supernatural activities. He made his first appearance in chapter 16 of the manga and is assigned to Kuesu, his job trying to keep any activity between the Demon Slayers and the ayakashi away from the public. He frequently has to deal with her arrogance and is quite concerned about her antics, once asking her how many bullets she fired from her duel with Himari. He later appears to recruit Yuto into his department, revealing to him and the others news about a cannibalistic ayakashi, only for Yuto to decline his offer. :In the anime, he left Kuesu and went to Shuten-d≈çji and Tama, orchestrating behind the scenes the events that will eventually lead to Himari's final battle with Tama. Because they both share similar but different goals (Kaburagi wants the ayakashi exterminated, while Shuten-d≈çji and Tama want to devour them to regain their full strength), he managed to reach an agreement with them that they can proceed with their plan, but they must not harm any humans as part of his deal; it was later broken after Tama's defeat by Himari's ayakashi form when Shuten-d≈çji betrayed him and injured him, having used him from the start to exact his revenge. In the final episode's end credits, he is last seen returning to Kuesu with a cast on his right arm. It is later revealed in the manga that he has a wife and a daughter, which was mentioned by Kuesu when she stated at her Christmas party that he left to pose as Santa Claus for his daughter. ; : :Yuto, Rinko, and Himari's schoolteacher at Touryou High. A smoker and a pervert, she always seem to catch Yuto in an erotic act with a girl, and is passively supportive of whatever erotic acts the students do as long as they do it outside of class. Rinko sometimes call her \\"Sae-chan\\", which she detests. It is later revealed in the manga that Sae is actually an ayakashi who protects Takamiya from the shadows, and claims to be more powerful than Himari and Shizuku at her peak. She is also the one responsible for erasing the memories of the patrons at Caf√© Relish, and is shown to have lesbian tendencies. It is still unknown what type of ayakashi Sae is. ; :Sae's colleague and an art teacher at Touryou High. ; :Taizo's younger sister. She transfers to Yuto's school as a first-year student in Chapter 49.

It was founded in 1991 by Mstislav Rostropovich, the world-renowned Russian cellist, and his wife, the soprano Galina Vishnevskaya. Currently, Elena Rostropovich, daughter of Mstislav Rostropovich and Galina Vishnevskaya, serves as the President of RVF. To date, RVF programs have benefited over 20 million children and young adults.Mstislav RostropovichGalina Vishnevskaya Mission RVF (Rostropovich-Vishnevskaya Foundation) promotes the health and wellbeing of children in need through sustainable, transformational public health programs in countries around the world. RVF is a non-political and non-partisan organization. History The Rostropovich-Vishnevskaya Foundation (RVF) was known as the Vishnevskaya- Rostropovich Foundation (VRF) until 2006. RVF was founded in 1991 by Mstislav Rostropovich and his wife Galina Vishnevskaya. Prior to 2000, the Rostropovich-Vishnevskaya Foundation primarily supplied modern medical equipment to children‚Äôs hospitals in Russia and provided advanced training to Russian doctors and nurses. Since 2000, RVF has focused on improving public health services for children. The majority of its resources are concentrated on modernizing national childhood vaccination schedules, preventing mother-to- child transmission of diseases, and deworming school-aged children. Over 20 million individuals have benefited from RVF's health programs. RVF successfully introduced the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the West Bank and Gaza, so that all newborns in both territories receive this life-saving vaccine. Local health authorities assumed full responsibility of the vaccination program in 2013, transitioning to complete local sustainability of the program. RVF launched a rotavirus vaccination program in the West Bank and Gaza in 2015. RVF‚Äôs Hepatitis B vaccination program of adolescents and at-risk health care workers in the Russia Federation(2000‚Äì2006) became the largest public health program for youth in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Approximately 2 million individuals in 22 regions of Russia were vaccinated. The program laid the groundwork for the Russian Ministry of Health‚Äôs continuing Hepatitis B vaccination initiative. measles eradication and Congenital Rubella Syndrome Prevention programs initiated by RVF in Azerbaijan,http://www.euro.who.int/mediacentre/PR/2006/20060222_1 Georgia,http://www.fas.usda.gov/FoodAidStories/stories/ViewStory.aspx?story_id=32 and Armeniahttp://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/VI%20Newsletter/0711_VI_Newsletter_XXXIV.pdf (2004‚Äì2009) helped vaccinate millions of individuals. In December 2009 the programs in these countries completed the transition to full financing by the national ministries of health. RVF's deworming programs in Central Asia have been conducted in close cooperation with the local Ministries of Health as well as the United States Government and have treated over 11 million children and adults. RVF began a newborn screening program to detect and ensure prompt treatment for critical congenital heart defects (CCHDs) in 2014. CCHDs are one of the most common severe malformations in the world. In the Republic of Georgia an estimated 1,000 babies are born each year with potentially fatal heart defects. Many babies born with CCHDs appear healthy at birth, only to develop acute deterioration and die several days after leaving their birth hospitals. Current activities RVF currently supports a rotavirus vaccination program in the West Bank and Gaza as well as addressing vaccine hesitancy in Russia, pneumococcal vaccine impact research in Russia, as well as supporting heart screening for newborns in Azerbaijan. RVF supports children‚Äôs health programs focusing on vaccination, screening and prevention and deworming and has been active in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and the West Bank and Gaza. Sustainability The strategy underlying RVF programs is to create mechanisms of sustainability by strengthening the existing health care infrastructure and avoiding the establishment of parallel structures. All programs are implemented by local health professionals supported by regular training and educational seminars to ensure that each program meets international standards. Each program is designed to be self-sustaining within three to five years of inception.

KLRC has been named the Christian Music Broadcasters (CMB) Small Market Radio Station of the Year six times: in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2006, 2008, and 2016. The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) named KLRC the Marconi Award winner for Religious Station of the Year in 2013. Station History KLRC began in late August 1983 as a 100 watt station serving only the John Brown University (JBU) campus and the immediate community. Located at 90.3 FM, the station was housed in the Cathedral of the Ozarks on the JBU campus. Its primary purpose was to serve as a training ground for JBU broadcasting students. In the fall of 1988, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved a power increase to 3,100 watts effective radiated power. With the higher power, the FCC also changed the frequency of KLRC from 90.3 to 101.1 FM. KLRC continued to see steady growth through the early 1990s. The number of listeners increased, and the donations received at each annual on-air fundraiser increased as well. In January 1996, KLRC began broadcasting 24 hours a day. In 2000, the sixty-year-old tower that KLRC had been broadcasting from was allowed to fall as the station began broadcasting from a new tower and transmitter. And, in September of that year, KLRC debuted worldwide with its live internet stream. In 2002, KLRC moved out of the Learning Resource Center and into its own building on the west end of the John Brown University campus, giving the station more room to expand. By July 2005, KLRC began broadcasting 23 hours of locally generated music programming each weekday. The station also added a new \\"Family Hour\\" each weeknight, comprising two family-oriented talk shows. The studios were moved again in the summer of 2011, this time to a building located off-campus in downtown Siloam Springs. The station's growth has continued, as the station went from one full-time employee in 1996 to ten full-time and several part-time staff as of 2019. In February 2013, KLRC launched a new 100,000 watt station at the frequency 90.9 FM. The new tower is located a few miles west of West Siloam Springs, Oklahoma, and the station is licensed to Tahlequah, Oklahoma. The station in Siloam Springs at the 101.1 FM frequency changed call-signs to KLAB, and now simulcasts with 90.9 FM. On-air staff Mark Michaels and Keri Lynn are the station's morning hosts. Ansen Bayer and Kara Culver are the afternoon show hosts. Isaac Weaver is the midday host, and Sean Sawatzky is the evening host. A variety of part-time staff and John Brown University broadcasting students fill the remaining on-air roles.

Experiments on the start of transcription for the hopCB operon indicate that hopC RNAs lie within the 5' untranslated region of this operon. The hopCB operon is induced to higher levels of expression in response to low pH. This fits in with data that HopCB is involved in binding to human epithelial cells, which is presumably something that the bacteria do during infection of the low-pH environment of the stomach. Previous work suggested that a repeat of 13 thymidine nucleotides might be involved in regulating the abundance of the hopCB operon.

Originating in the early 2000s and peaking around the late 2000s, Nintendocore was started by bands like Horse the Band, An Albatross, The NESkimos and Minibosses.  Characteristics  Nintendocore frequently features the use of electric guitars, drum kits, and typical rock instrumentation alongside synthesizers, chiptunes, 8-bit sounds, and electronically produced beats. It originated out of a diverse range of musical styles, including various forms of hardcore punk and heavy metal. In addition to these origins, notable Nintendocore bands have been influenced by a variety of other genres, such as post-hardcore, metalcore, electro, noise rock, post- rock, and screamo. Thus, Nintendocore groups vary stylistically. Horse the Band combines metalcore, heavy metal, thrash metal, and post-hardcore with post-rock passages. \\"The Black Hole\\" from Horse the Band's third album, The Mechanical Hand, is an example of Nintendocore, featuring screamed vocals, heavy \\"Nintendo riffs,\\" and \\"sound effects from numerous games.\\" Math the Band includes electro and dance-punk styles. Minibosses use Kyuss-inspired heavy metal riffing, and The Advantage is associated with styles such as noise rock and post-rock. The Depreciation Guild was an indie band that incorporated 8-bit sounds, video game music, and elements of shoegaze. Some bands feature singing, such as The Depreciation Guild, whose frontman Kurt Feldman provides \\"ethereal\\" and \\"tender vocals,\\" and The Megas, who write lyrics that mirror video game storylines. Others, such as Horse the Band and Math the Band, add screamed vocals into the mix. But yet other groups are strictly instrumental, such as Minibosses, and The Advantage. While otherwise diverse, all Nintendocore groups \\"use specific instruments to mimic the sounds of Nintendo games.\\"  Etymology  The term \\"Nintendocore\\" is a portmanteau of Nintendo, the popular gaming system from which many of the genre's samples originate and the \\"core\\" suffix, which is often used to denote the various subgenres of hardcore punk. The term did not arise until the early 2000's, when the frontman of the metalcore group, Horse the Band originally coined the term \\"Nintendocore\\" as a joke. However, several members of the group have since attempted to distance themselves from the descriptor, such as bassist Dashiel Arkenstone, who stated: \\"I reject it [Nintendocore] because it cheapens our music.\\" History (late 1970s‚Äìpresent) Emerging in the late 70's, synthpop pioneers Yellow Magic Orchestra,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jul/04/electronicmusic.filmandmusic11 sampled Space Invaders sounds in their influential 1978 debut album (self- titled), particularly the hit song \\"Computer Game.\\" In turn, the band would have a major influence on much of the video game music produced during the 8-bit and 16-bit eras, often referred to as the Golden age of arcade video games. The pop group Buckner & Garcia can also be considered a precursor to the genre, as they are the very first band to write and record an entire album about video arcade games, and even used sampled arcade game sound effects in their songs. Their 1981 album called Pac-Man Fever contained songs such as Do The Donkey Kong (based on a game which was produced by Nintendo). Former YMO member Haruomi Hosono also released a 1984 album produced entirely from Namco arcade game samples entitled Video Game Music, an early example of a chiptune record. The first known rock band to cover a video game song from an actual game however was the all-female indie rock group Autoclave with their cover of the theme song from the popular video game Paperboy which was recorded in 1990.Autoclave (album) The second rock group known to cover a video game song was the band Mr. Bungle, with their live cover of the Super Mario Bros. theme song, which was a regular staple throughout their 1990s‚Äô live concert setlist. Mr. Bungle also sampled sounds from video games on their debut album from 1991.Mr. Bungle (album) Horse the Band, the group who originally coined the term have released five studio albums in the Nintendocore style, starting with 2000's Secret Rhythm of the Universe. Nintendocore pioneers The Advantage performing in Japan in 2010. Another Nintendocore pioneer is The Advantage, whom The New York Times praises as one of the groups who brought video game music into the mainstream modern music spotlight. The Advantage is an instrumental rock band formed by two students attending Nevada Union High School. Spencer Seim first heard the original two band members play at a 1999 Nevada Union High School talent show, beginning his musical career, and continued to lead the group forward after high school. The group \\"plays nothing but music from the original Nintendo console games.\\" By creating rock cover versions of video game sound tracks, they have \\"brought legitimacy to a style of music dubbed Nintendocore.\\" The Minibosses at Penny Arcade Expo 2005 (now PAX). The Phoenix-based rock group, Minibosses, \\"[is] one of the most well-established bands in the Nintendocore genre, with an impressive roster of covers including Contra, Double Dragon, Excitebike,\\" and covers of other video game themes. Minibosses is known as one of the primary representatives of Nintendo rock, performing at various video game expositions. In addition to covers, the band has also produced original work. The Harvard Crimson refers to Minibosses as \\"sworn rivals\\" of The NESkimos, another Nintendocore practitioner. The 2007 debut album by The Depreciation Guild, In Her Gentle Jaws has been referred to as Nintendocore by Pitchfork Media. The website wrote that \\"In Her Gentle Jaws sticks its neck out further than Nintendocore staples like The Advantage or Minibosses\\", and that the album's instrumental title track \\"could plausibly come from an NES cartridge.\\" On July 17, 2016 the genre got broad attention again when a small group of modern Nintendocore artists including Unicorn Hole, Polygon Horizon, and Got Item released a compilation album themed after Super Smash Brothers 64. This album was released by the net label \\"N-Core Lives\\", which strives to keep the genre alive. An article about the Super Smash Brothers compilation was published by Altpress, bringing the genre back into the public mind. Math the Band, an electronic punk band from Rhode Island, is yet another band associated with the Nintendocore sound. Their use of \\"analog synthesizers, vintage drum machines, old video game systems and shitty guitars\\" provides the sound that is commonly associated with Nintendocore. Having played shows in the U.K., Mexico, and Canada with a variety of artists and rappers, they have helped spread the genre to venues outside of the United States. Math the Band is one of the bands with the Nintendocore sound still active today, performing at MAGFest 2020 and their latest album \\"Flange Factory Five\\" releasing in October 2020.

He was the son of Nikolaos Tombazis and brother of Iakovos Tombazis. During the early years of the War of Independence, he participated in several naval battles and served as a representative for his native island in the national assemblies of Epidaurus and Astros. Appointed Commissioner for Crete in early 1823, he arrived on the island on 21 May 1823 at the fort of Kissamos with a small fleet of five warships, three transports and 600, mostly Epirote, volunteers. His arrival gave new impetus and hope to Cretan insurgents, notably since the Ottoman Turks at the fort surrendered shortly after his arrival, on May 25, and this was followed by other victories.Detorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 377 However, Tombazis was criticised for his delay in organising a military force to repel the expected arrival of 12,000 Turkish-Egyptian soldiers under the command of Hussein Bey, a son-in-law of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. When he finally gathered 3,000 insurgents at Gergeri they were no match for the larger and better-trained force at the battle of Amourgelles on 20 August 1823.Detorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 379 In 1828 he was appointed by Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias as Minister for Naval Affairs, but resigned shortly after when he disagreed with his policies. He died at Hydra in 1831, leaving behind a son, Nikolaos (1815‚Äì1896).

The drama series grew out of discussions between Mackenzie and the actress and singer Georgia Brown, who was dissatisfied at the lack of decent roles for women in TV drama. Brown enlisted the producer Verity Lambert in the project she and Mackenzie were devising to dramatise the struggle for women's suffrage, and the three women presented the idea to the BBC, which gave approval for the series. Originally they had hoped to use only female script writers but this proved impracticable. Male writers were used and the three female originators of the project later said they needed to remove from their scripts a number of 'innuendoes, misconceptions and untruths' indicative of what Georgia Brown termed \\"the male point of view\\".http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/shoulder.htm The TV series, directed by Waris Hussein and Moira Armstrong, dramatized the fight for the right to vote for British women. It covered the period from the 1890s to 1919 and followed the suffrage movement as it was influenced by the Pankhursts: Richard, Emmeline, Christabel and Sylvia, and Annie Kenney. The series was written by Douglas Livingstone, Alan Plater, Ken Taylor and Hugh Whitemore. The series was a co-production between the BBC and Warner Bros. Television.http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/1253044/ The designers were Susan Spence, Evan Hercules and Eileen Diss; costumes were by Joan Ellacott. Emmeline Pankhurst was played by Sian Phillips; her daughters Christabel and Sylvia by Patricia Quinn and Angela Down. Michael Gough played Emmeline's husband, Dr Richard Pankhurst. Georgia Brown played Annie Kenney, a mill worker who joined the cause and eventually became a dynamic speaker for the movement. Lady Constance Lytton, an upper class activist for women's suffrage who underwent force feeding in prison, was played by Judy Parfitt. Sally Miles played Flora Drummond; Sheila Allen, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence. Fulton Mackay played the socialist leader Keir Hardie, Robert Hardy was Asquith and Bob Hoskins played Jack Dunn.http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/shoulder.htm The book Shoulder to Shoulder documents the lives and works of some of Britain's leading suffragettes.

It stars Scott Adkins, Bruce Payne, and Daniella Alonso as members of paramilitary group tasked with hunting down and destroying zombies after an outbreak. Plot A young girl returns home to find her parents missing and the house in disarray. She sits down to watch television, and the news reveals that five years earlier, a zombie outbreak killed off 4.5 billion people worldwide, 10 million of which are from the United States. After detonating a nuclear bomb over San Francisco and walling off New York City, the U.S. government declared the outbreak over and established a paramilitary force known as R-Division to hunt down and destroy the remaining zombies. The girl watches a reality TV series called Re-Kill that broadcasts live footage of R-Division squads. Commercials interrupt the show, showing attempts to repopulate the United States and reassure the populace. The show begins with a recap. An embedded journalist accompanies a squad on a raid to New Orleans, which has had reports of zombie activity. The squad is overrun, and only two people make it to a car: Alex Winston and the journalist. When the journalist stops speaking coherently and moans uncontrollably, Winston realizes she is infected and shoots her. The government promises that the situation is under control and clears out the zombies. Winston is reassigned to Division 6, which includes new recruit Tom Falkirk, former thief Omar Hernandez, immigrant Nguyen, Rose Matthews, \\"Grizzly\\" Adams, conspiracy theorist Trent Parker, and the squad leader, Sarge. Along with embedded journalists Jimmy and Bobby, Division 8 is sent to investigate reports of a family who are harboring reanimated members. Sarge explains that the outbreak spread so far because people could not give up hope their loved ones could be saved. After neutralizing the human resistance, the soldiers rescue prisoners kept chained up for zombie food. One of the family members reveals that his sister, a zombie, is kept in the attic. Before she can be put down, she bites Tom, who is mercy-killed to prevent him from turning into a zombie. In interviews, Parker is dismissive of Tom's sacrifice, and Sarge says that it is a known risk of the job. Division 8's next job is to investigate a truck suspected of carrying contraband. When they finally stop the truck, they find it contains zombies. Sarge uses a rocket-propelled grenade to clear out the zombies. The truckers initially profess ignorance of their cargo but eventually confirm rumors of the Judas Project, a shadowy program rumored to be an experiment on the zombies trapped in New York City. Parker believes it to be a secret military project, but Sarge is more concerned with the possibility of a second outbreak, which he believes is inevitable due to human nature. In the forbidden areas of New York City known as The Zone, they discover dead scientists and zombies who seem more intelligent. After an ambush, Omar insists that Parker was bit and demands they kill him. Before they kill him, Parker opens fire on the squad, killing Adams. Winston is wounded next, and he sacrifices himself with a grenade to allow the others to escape. In a previously recorded interview, he describes his belief that the government has secretly organized an ark for eligible survivors; he posthumously wishes the squad well and hopes they are accepted there. Deeper in the Zone, Hernandez is bitten and turns. As the squad faces a horde of zombies, including Hernandez, a man who claims to be the last remaining member of the Judas Project leads them to safety. He explains the project was designed to turn the zombies against each other, but it instead revealed an alpha zombie, nicknamed Elvis, capable of leading a zombie army. Jimmy says the network's drones will pick up and broadcast his and Bobby's footage every two hours. As they perform reconnaissance, Bobby dies, alerting the zombie army. The squad flees, only to be overwhelmed by zombies and killed one-by-one with the only survivor being Rose, who manages to kill Elvis. As a special news report reveals zombie activity near the Zone and the start of a new outbreak, the young girl who was watching the program is revealed to have transformed into a zombie. Elsewhere, it is shown that the ark is real and soldiers, including Rose, discuss having found groups of survivors.

The video was created as a response to the celebrity remake \\"We Are the World 25 for Haiti\\" that was released eight days earlier, and is a cover of \\"We Are the World\\", the 1985 charity single produced in support of famine relief in Africa. Making the video Lavie conceived, organized, performed in, and with fellow YouTube personality Iman Crosson, co- edited, the video for charity relief of victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake occurring the month before. Lavie said that she \\"was in the car driving and the idea to do a YouTube version of We Are the World popped into (her) head.\\" She determined how to assign portions of the song to respective YouTube singers, by \\"going to each singer's (YouTube) channel and listen(ing) to their voices to get a better idea of how high or low a singer could sing, if a particular part would sound better with their tonal quality, etc.\\" In interviews on CNN and ABC World News, Lavie explained how the video was made, given that its 57 contributors would not be performing in the same studio and generally did not even know each other. After deciding on the assignments of singers to song segments, she sent all the singers the same instrumental backing. A Radio Canada feature included a video segment of Montr√©al singer Heidi Jutras' vocal performance, in which she suppressed the instrumental accompaniment by using earphones. The singers then returned their respective vocal video segments to Lavie electronically, for the visual segments to be edited, and the audio to be mixed and edited, over the course of \\"three days (and) one sleepless night.\\" Lavie specifically pointed out the challenge of mixing the vocal segments, made \\"tedious\\" by the segments' different sound levels, recorded in different acoustic environments (bathrooms, kitchens, bedrooms), and made by microphones of different type and quality. The resulting composite vocal and visual segments, combined with the single instrumental backing, constituted the resulting video. The video was posted as a YouTube \\"video response\\" to the 2010 celebrity remake video on YouTube, whose last minute included a video annotation inviting such video responses. CNN's Josh Levs made special note of Lavie's use of YouTube's video annotation feature: her video continually provided successive video annotation hyperlinks to the YouTube channels of the respective contributing singers as their images appeared on-screen throughout the performance. Media coverage Called \\"a massive charity collaboration for the digital age\\" by CTV's national television program Canada AM, within days after it was posted the video became the subject of media attention, including multiple national television features on CNN and a primetime news feature on ABC World News with Diane Sawyer. CNN's Josh Levs reported that \\"a lot of people are telling us that this is better than the celebrity remake. It certainly is a sign of the times and a case of where we are right now.\\" In the second CNN interview that was aired, CNN's Richard Lui remarked \\"This really is sort of‚Äînot to be trite here‚Äîwe are the world,\\" alluding to the song's title \\"We Are the World.\\" Levs added that \\"Richard's exactly right. ... Getting together fifty-seven singers, all over the world, ... and they all made their own recordings, and the world therefore put these different (recordings) together.\\" ABC's Diane Sawyer conducted a Skype interview with Lavie, asking her motivation for making the video. Lavie responded that \\"the way we (singers) give back is by singing.\\" Singer Melissa Polinar explained, \\"We didn't really do it to compete with the remake,\\" with Lavie emphasizing that the YouTube collaboration \\"reaches people in a different way.\\" Hours after ABC News posted the Skype interview online, the collaboration video's participants were recognized as \\"Persons of the Week\\" on the nationally televised ABC World News with Diane Sawyer to close the work week on Friday, March 19, 2010. The television broadcast paired segments of celebrity singers' performances with those of YouTube singers who sang the corresponding segments of the song, with Sawyer narrating: \\"He may not be Lionel Richie, but the fourteen-year old high school student in his bedroom in Perth, Australia, can sing. Instead of Al Jarreau, this manager of a California youth program. In for Michael Jackson, a community college student. Diana Ross has been replaced by a young woman in Montr√©al singing in her bathroom. And for Dionne Warwick, this receptionist at a hair salon in Santa Barbara.\\" Sawyer's further explanation: \\"Perfect strangers, perfect harmony, making a joyful sound... in effect saying, we are the world, too... And so (for \\"Persons of the Week\\") we choose Lisa Lavie and the singers she brought together around the globe, who proved that that anthem is not just for glittering names.\\" The singers performed together in person in Washington, D.C. for a private event on December 6, 2010. The day following the ABC World News feature, CNN online posted a supplemental feature that was being broadcast on CNN International: a \\"YouTube sensation, a new version of the popular song that's attracted more than 1.7 million views‚Äîand not a celebrity in sight.\\" Three days after the ABC World News feature, USA Today characterized Lavie as a \\"visionary\\" for conceiving the \\"phenom\\" YouTube video. A Radio Canada feature emphasized the divergent sources of the segments constituting the video, noting that some of the 57 contributors sang \\"in their bedroom, living room or even in their bathroom\\" but that the result is assez remarquable (quite remarkable). CNN's Josh Levs explained that \\"the official YouTube channel of the celebrity version, is now posting this (YouTube collaboration) version there,\\" meaning that a thumbnail photo link to the YouTube collaboration video was displayed as a \\"Favorite\\" on the YouTube channel of the We Are The World Foundation adjacent the official celebrity remake video. Formal recognition Cumulative video views over the first eight months (some points linearly interpolated). Formal recognition of the video included: * The video's participants were recognized as \\"Persons of the Week\\" on ABC World News with Diane Sawyer (March 19, 2010). * CNN Newsroom's Josh Levs chose the YouTube video as the best viral video of 2010 in its \\"Viral Video Rewind\\" feature (December 26, 2010). * The video was recognized by YouTube's official \\"TheYearInReview\\" channel in its \\"Moments That Defined YouTube in 2010\\" feature (December 2010). Reception by viewers The video received its first half-million views on YouTube in two days, and more than 830,000 views in its first six days.

Early years Slovtsov was born in the village of Ustyanskoye in Yeniseysk Governorate of the Russian Empire, to the family of a deacon. His father died when the boy was five, and the mother re-located with Pyotr to Krasnoyarsk. According to family tradition, the boy attended an ecclesiastical school and then a seminary. At the seminary, the boy's discant was noticed by the seminary's choir-master, Pavel Ivanov-Radkevich, who entrusted Pyotr with performing a solo. The local press was impressed with Pyotr's performance to the point of predicting a brilliant career for the boy. After the graduation, Slovtsov entered the law school of the University of Warsaw, but dropped out only six months later, choosing to attend Moscow Conservatory instead. There he specialized in solo singing under Professor Ivan Gordi. Slovtsov graduated from the Conservatory with its gold medal in 1912. Beginning of the career Eugene Onegin From that time his name appeared on placards in many Russian cities, including Kiev (1912‚Äì1914), Saratov (1914), St. Petersburg (1915‚Äì1917), Nizhny-Novgorod (1917), Sverdlovsk (1919, 1930), Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre (1929‚Äì1932) and Leningrad (end of 1920-beginning 1930). He made his operatic debut with the Kiev Opera in 1912, and sang there until 1915, when he joined the Petrograd People's House Theatre with a repertoire that included Faust, Rusalka, and Prince Igor. In 1920 he and his wife, the singer M.N Rioli-Slovtsova moved to Krasnoyarsk, although in 1928 he was appointed professor of solo of singing at the Russian Academy of Theatre Arts and continued his appearances the Bolshoi in a wide variety of operatic roles. Slovtsov‚Äôs records are extremely rare and sought-after by collectors. Pyotr I. Slovtsov was called by his contemporaries \\"the Siberian nightingale\\", and was ranked with such well-known tenors of the day as Vladimir Rosing, A.M. Davydov, Leonid Sobinov, Dmitri Smirnov and Andrey Labinsky. The singer had an extraordinary rare voice and mastered the high level of skill as drama actor, making him worthy of the traditions of tenor Nikolay Figner, who combined musical, vocal and stage skills in a harmonious performance of opera art. Repertoire Notwithstanding the technical imperfections of the recordings he made, one can tell that the voice of Peter Slovtzov was naturally rich and attractive, of mellow timbre, clear and unique in its strength yet velvet sounding. Feodor Chaliapin highly appreciated his talent, and they sang together in the operas Prince Igor, Rusalka, Faust, Mozart and Salieri and The Barber of Seville. For long years the bosom friendship connected Slovtzov with well-known masters of drama as Leonid Sobinov, Nadezhda Obukhova, Vasili Kachalov and Antonina Nezhdanova. Many newspapers and journals at that time highly appreciated Slovtzov's talent: \\"Slovtzov has a wonderful school. His voice, though of mellow timbre, impeccably obeys to its master.\\" His best roles included Vladimir Igorevich (Prince Igor, Alexander Borodin), the Prince (Rusalka, Alexander Dargomyzhsky ), Vladimir Dubrovsky (Dubrovsky, Eduard N√°pravn√≠k), the Indian visitor (Sadko, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov), Tsar Berendey (The Snow Maiden, Rimsky- Korsakov), Mozart (Mozart and Salieri, Rimsky-Korsakov), Lensky (Eugene Onegin, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, in 1915), Count Almaviva (The Barber of Seville, Gioachino Rossini), Alfred (La traviata, Giuseppe Verdi), Faust (Faust, Charles Gounod), Romeo (Romeo et Juliette, Gounod), Nadir (The Pearl Fishers, Georges Bizet), Dzherald (Lakm√©, Leo Delibes). Other roles he sang included Vasya (The Power of the Fiend, Alexander Serov); the Duke (Rigoletto, Giuseppe Verdi) and Lohengrin (Lohengrin Richard Wagner). Partners on stage included A. M. Bragin, R. G. Gorskaja, L. Lipkovskaja, V. Sokovnin, Antonina Nezhdanova(in Bolshoi Theatre, in Traviata by Verdi, 1928), V. K. Pavlovskaya and M. O. Reizen (in Rusalka), Feodor Chaliapin (in operas Rusalka, Prince Igor, Mozart and Salieri, Faust, The Barber of Seville; the singer presented to Slovtsov a photo dated 31 December 1915 with an inscription: \\"With kind memories and warm wishes for success in the art world\\"). Conductors Slovtsov sang under included Mark Golinkin (1875‚Äì1963), Abram Markson, Ariy Pazovsky, etc. Career as director and teacher Slovtsov was also a talented director and a vocal coach. He was not tall, a bit plump with an open Russian face. He attracted people with his simple-heartedness. Organizing abilities helped Slovtsov to unite talented people around him. In Krasnoyarsk (Siberia) he organized the vocal school for the People‚Äôs Conservatory, Worker‚Äôs Opera and society \\"Music for the Masses\\". He staged 14 operas in Krasnoyarsk. In 1928 Slovtsov was invited by professor of solo singing in Russian Academy of Theatre Arts. During 22 years of his creative activity Slovtsov gave two thousand concerts. Marriage His wife, Margarita N. Rioly, was a lyrico-dramatic soprano and also an opera singer. She had studied solo singing at the Moscow Conservatory under V.M. Zarudnaya-Ivanova, and graduated a year earlier than Slovtzov. Rioly was not only a talented singer, but also a remarkable teacher of singing. But most of all she loved the opera stage and performed leading roles on opera stages of Tiflis, Kharkov (1913), Ekaterinburg (1915‚Äì1916), Petrograd (Narodny Dom), Tomsk, Irkutsk and Krasnoyarsk. In 1915 M. Rioly married P.I. Slovtzov and from that time they cooperated in concert activity and performed together on opera stages. Margarita N. Rioly was also an excellent pianist, so became Slovtzov‚Äôs favourite accompanist. 11 Gorky St. Where the National Conservatory was in 1920 In 1934, Slovtsov caught cold while performing on his tour in one of the city of Soviet Union and soon died. His monument of white marble is located in Pokrovsky cemetery in Krasnoyarsk. The words engraved on the monument are from opera Werther: \\"Why awaken me, O breath of Spring?\\". Margarita Nikolaevna Rioli-Slovtsova continued teaching for another twenty years in Krasnoyarsk. Among the students of Margarita Nikolaevna - E. K. Iofel, who later became a professor and teacher Dmitry Hvorostovsky - the world famous baritone. Memorial events Monument on a tomb of P. I. Slovtsov on Troitsk a cemetery of Krasnoyarsk. To mark the 120th anniversary of his birth, The Central Museum of Musical Culture by M.I. Glinka published a CD of 26 songs and arias recorded by Slovtsov before 1917. This CD was presented in the 42nd Exhibition MIDEM, 2008 in Cannes. That same year broadcasts about the tenor were made by National radio, RtV-Podmoskovie, Radio Rossii and Radio Maria; and in the USA, Marston Records released a CD \\"Pyotr Ivanovich Slovtsov. The Russian tenor\\" mastered by the Grammy Award-winning engineer Ward Marston. On 10 October 2010 Radio Rossii made a 44-minute broadcast about Slovtsov.

The Russian army of Novgorod led by Ivan Khovansky defeated the Polish‚ÄìLithuanians led by Miko≈Çaj Judycki and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Wo≈Ç≈Çowicz. As a result, the Polish-Lithuanian army retreated to the safety of the walls of Lyakhovichi. Background At the end of 1658, significant Polish‚ÄìLithuanian forces placed themselves in the region of Myadel, an area which previously swore a loyalty oath to the Russian Tsar. Many of the nobles (szlachta), however, followed the appeal of Hetman Pawe≈Ç Jan Sapieha to join the Commonwealth army. After the signing of the treaty of Valiesar the Russian army could bring its troops to Lithuania that were so far involved in fighting the Swedes.

However, the Commonwealth army had still a considerable number of 6,000 soldiers. Battle On January 24, a Russian cavalry corps (\\"yertoul\\") counting up to 1,000 men was sent out to capture some prisoners who would provide important information on Lithuanians. The corps met the avantgarde of the Lithuanian army near the village of Postavy and smashed it, having captured the flag and many prisoners. Several days later, Khovansky with other troops caught up. On January 29, the yertoul defeated another Lithuanian detachment near Myadel and pursued it until the town, killing many of its men. Here, the Russians met the main forces of the enemy. In the following clash, the Lithuanians began to prevail, however the Russian reinforcement of 1,000 cavalrymen of Khovansky arrived. Since the yertoul itself was relatively numerous with 1,000 men the Lithuanians believed the Khovansky army was much bigger and panic spread when Khovansky troops appeared on horizon. The effect was overwhelming: the mass of Lithuanians fled the battlefield, running for their lives, and stopped just in Novahrudak. The Russians pursued them up to 30 miles and captured the supply wagons, artillery and 200 men.

InDevR Inc. is a privately held, woman-owned small business located in Boulder, Colorado, USA. History The company was founded in 2003 by Kathy L. Rowlen, Laura R. Kuck, and John W. Birks as an LLC. The origin of the name derived from its early stage goals of Instrument Development and Research. The company converted to a corporation in 2005 with a shift toward product sales and customer support. In 2005, InDevR purchased majority ownership of 2B Technologies, a leader in the field of analytical instruments for atmospheric and environmental measurements. An ISO 9001:2000-certified manufacturer, 2B Technologies has produced and sold over 2,000 ozone monitors and related instruments. InDevR is an example of the Small Business Innovation Research program sponsored by the federal government. The company received a Phase I grant in 2006 to develop a revolutionary instrument for Virus Quantification from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Based on demonstration of feasibility in Phase I, InDevR received a Phase II grant in 2008. Both of these grants led directly to the creation of several high-tech jobs that continue to date as InDevR translated the funding for research and development into the commercially available Virus Counter product line. In 2012, InDevR spun off the Virus Counter Instrument to ViroCyt, LCC. According to a press release from January 15, 2013, \\"ViroCyt will be responsible for expanding the commercial market for the Virus Counter technology developed by InDevR.\\" The focus of InDevR's efforts will now be on the development and commercialization of their low-density microarray technology, which can be used to improve the analysis of viruses and other microorganisms as well as detecting and characterizing proteins. Products=ampliPHOX ampliPHOX Colorimetric Detection Technology was created as a research tool for the analysis of low-density microarrays by providing rapid, cost effective colorimetric detection with minimal user input. Rather than a fluorescent label traditionally used in microarray applications, ampliPHOX Colorimetric Detection Technology utilizes a photoinitiator that, when activated by light, generates signal amplification through polymerization of an organic monomer. The detection technology is easy to use and can be completed within minutes when applied to low-density microarrays. The ampliPHOX Reader is used to activate photopolymerization on low-density microarrays, to image the resulting pattern of visual spots, and automatically interpret the image ‚Äì providing the user with immediate results. In addition to the ampliPHOX Colorimetric Detection Technology, InDevR also supplies Custom Low Density Microarrays specifically designed to work with the ampliPHOX platform. The Custom Microarrays can include up to 850 unique probes per array. Research at the USDA has utilized ampliPHOX to profile Shiga toxin- producing Escherichia coli by identifying the O-antigen gene clusters and virulence genes. FluChip The FluChip was invented by a joint team of scientists at the University of Colorado at Boulder and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta) in an NIAID-supported effort led by then-Professor Kathy Rowlen. InDevR licensed the intellectual property from the University of Colorado and CDC in 2009. Identification of influenza viruses using the FluChip is one application InDevR is targeting in their development of a fully automated molecular diagnostics platform.

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves of Nazi Germany. Crasemann fought as an artillery officer during World War I on both the Western and Eastern Fronts but left the military in 1919, returning to civilian life. In 1936, he joined the Heer (Army) branch of the Wehrmacht in 1936. He served in the Battle of France and the Western Desert Campaign as a battalion- and regimental-level commander. He was briefly acting commander of the 15th Panzer Division in mid-1942. In 1944 he was given command of the 26th Panzer Division, which was operating in Italy. He then commanded the XII SS Army Corps from January to April 1945 until it surrendered to United States troops. Under Crasemann's command, the 26th Panzer Division massacred over 160 Italian civilians in the Padule di Fucecchio massacre. In 1947 he was tried by a war crimes tribunal run by the British authorities in Padua. Convicted and sentenced to a 10-year imprisonment, Crasemann died in prison in 1950. Early life Born in the city of Hamburg on 5 March 1891, Eduard Crasemann joined the army of Imperial Germany in 1910 as a Fahnenjunker (officer cadet). He was commissioned as a Leutnant (second lieutenant) in the 46th Field Artillery Regiment the following year. World War I Crasemann's regiment was attached to the 20th Infantry Division during World War I and he saw extensive service on the Western Front from August 1914 to March 1915 at which time the division was transferred to the Eastern Front. At the time, he was a Oberleutnant (first lieutenant) and regimental adjutant and had been awarded the Iron Cross, 2nd Class. Involved in fighting engagements in Poland and Ukraine, his regiment was soon back in France where it participated in battles in the areas around Champagne and Aisne. Crasemann was awarded the Iron Cross, 1st Class, for his part in these battles. In response to a summer offensive launched by the Russians, the 20th Infantry Division was one of several that were transferred to the Eastern Front. It incurred several casualties and it was withdrawn from the front lines in September 1916. After completing a refit and a period of training, it was sent back to France. It was soon engaged in the Battle of Chemin des Dames and during this time, Crasemann was temporary commander of an artillery battery. Casualties were heavy and the division was soon out of the line for rest before being transferred to the Eastern Front for a few months. It returned to France in September but at this stage of the war, Crasemann was on a temporary transfer to the infantry as a commander of a company in the 77th Infantry Regiment. Crasemann had only just returned to his regular duties as regimental adjutant in November 1917 when he was appointed to the General Staff of the Army and posted to the headquarters of the Marinekorps (Naval Corps), which provided naval personnel serving as infantry in Belgium. He remained here for six months before taking a post with the 35th Infantry Division as its quartermaster, which was also serving in Belgium. Promoted to Hauptmann (captain) in August 1918, his role ceased with the disbandment of the division following the end of the war. Crasemann returned to his original regiment and became a battalion commander. He applied to serve with the newly formed Reichswehr (Imperial Defence) but was declined and subsequently left the military in April 1919. Interwar period After several years of civilian life, Crasemann returned to service with the Heer (Army) branch of the Wehrmacht (Defence Force) in 1936 and was posted to the operations branch of the Oberkommando des Heeres (High Command of the Army), known as OKH. He was promoted to major that June and the following year was transferred to the maneuvers and operational planning branch of the OKH. In November 1938 he was posted to II. Battalion of the 20th Artillery Regiment, where he spent six months on staff before taking up a battery command with the 73rd Artillery Regiment, 1st Panzer Division. This gave him vital experience in leading motorised formations, particularly when supporting tanks. World War II During the invasion of Poland, Crasemann led his battery as the 1st Panzer Division advanced on and into Warsaw. Once the Polish Campaign was over, and after a spell in Germany, in February 1940 he was given command of II. Battalion, 78th Motorised Artillery Regiment. It was attached to the 7th Panzer Division, commanded by Generalmajor (major general) Erwin Rommel, and performed well during the campaign in France. Promoted to Oberstleutnant in August 1940, he was on occupation duty in France when Rommel, having taken command of the Afrika Korps in February 1941, arranged his transfer to North Africa. Here Crasemann was appointed commander of the 33rd Motorised Artillery Regiment. Crasemann's new command was part of 15th Panzer Division and with it, he participated in the significant engagements in North Africa, including Operation Crusader and the battles around Tobruk. Awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 26 December 1941 for his leadership of the 33rd Motorised Artillery Regiment, he was promoted to oberst (colonel) early the following year. When the commander of the 15th Panzer Division was wounded in May 1942, Crasemann was made its acting commander. He led the division through the Battle of Gazala and, along with the rest of Rommel's forces, contributed to the British defeat. In late July, after the subsequent fighting during which the division, along with the 21st Panzer Division, captured Tobruk and 35,000 Allied soldiers, Crasemann reverted to command of the 33rd Artillery Regiment as Generalmajor Heinz von Randow had arrived in Africa to take over the division. The regiment participated in the Battle of Alam Halfa and the subsequent Second Battle of El Alamein, after which it had only seven guns. The Afrika Korps was now in retreat from Egypt and it had withdrawn to Tripolitania when, on 17 January 1943, Crasemann was dispatched back to Germany and placed in reserve. After a period of three months, he was posted to the Eastern Front as commander of the 116th Panzer Artillery Regiment, 5th Panzer Division. He performed well in the fighting around Orel from mid-July to mid-August and on 1 September 1943 was given a posting to XXIV Panzer Corps as commander of 143rd Artillery Command. Under General der Panzertruppe (General of Panzer Troops) Walter Nehring, he served throughout the defensive battles of late 1943 and early 1944. In April 1944, Crasemann went to Germany for a period of leave and then, instead of returning to Russia, he went on a one-month divisional commanders' course at the War Academy at Hirschberg. In early July 1944 he was posted to Italy as the acting commander of 26th Panzer Division. His term in command was short, as Generalmajor Hans Boelsen arrived on 18 July, with Crasemann reverting to deputy commander. However, the following month Boelsen took over the 18th Panzergrenadier Division while Crasemann became the permanent commander of 26th Panzer Division. Engaged in the fighting on the Gothic Line with the Eighth Army, the 26th Panzer Division fought a series of delaying actions, retreating to just south of Bologna at which time it was withdrawn for a rest. Crasemann was awarded the Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross promoted to Generalmajor in October, and was recalled to Germany for promotion. Crasemann was appointed commander of XII SS Army Corps, 15th Army, in early 1945, taking over from General der Infanterie (General of Infantry) G√ºnther Blumentritt. Despite the SS designation in its title, his new command consisted largely of Heer personnel. Stationed on the Western Front along the Ruhr River it opposed the United States Ninth Army, which commenced an offensive on 23 February. He was promoted Generalleutnant (lieutenant general) two days later. The Germans were pushed back and by 1 April had become encircled in the Ruhr Pocket. XII SS Army Corps was destroyed and Crasemann surrendered to United States troops on 17 April. Trial and conviction Imprisoned in Special Camp 11 along with several other high ranking German personnel, in 1947 Crasemann faced a war crimes tribunal run by British authorities in Padua. This was in relation to a charge of complicity with the massacre of 162 Italian civilians in Padule di Fucecchio near Florence on 23 August 1944, during his time in command of 26th Panzer Division. He was found guilty of war crimes and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. He spent the rest of his life in jail, dying in Werl on 28 April 1950.

He played college football at the University of Washington. He was considered one of the top linebacker prospects for the 2010 NFL Draft, and was selected with the 79th overall pick by the San Diego Chargers. Early years Butler attended Del Campo High School in Fair Oaks, California. As a junior in 2004, he had 1,504 rushing yards and 22 touchdowns, leading Del Campo to a 9-2 record and the Capital Athletic League championship. He was selected an All- Metro second-team and All-CAL MVP pick. Limited to seven games by a hamstring injury, Butler led Del Campo to an 8-3 record and a state playoff berth as a senior in 2005, rushing for 762 yards and 16 touchdowns, with an average of 9.29 yards per carry and 108.9 yards per game. He was named an honorable mention All-Metro selection by the Sacramento Bee. Butler also lettered in track & field while at Del Campo. He competed as a sprinter (11.38 seconds in the 100-meter dash and 23.53 seconds in the 200-meter dash) and long jumper (personal-best of 6.21m or 20'4\\"). Butler was named one of the Top 15 prospects in the Sacramento area by the Sacramento Bee. He was ranked 55th nationally among outside linebackers by Rivals.com. On March 3, 2005, Butler committed to the University of Washington. College career In four years at Washington, Butler had 239 tackles (159 solo), 26.5 TFLs (for 78 yards), three sacks (for 35 yards), five forced fumbles, one fumble recovery, two interceptions (for 15 yards), and seven pass deflections. At the NFL Combine, he had 35 reps benching 225. At his Pro Day, he had a 4.61 40, a 35.5 vertical, a 121.0 broad jump, a 4.28 shuttle, and a 6.93 three cone drill. Professional career=San Diego Chargers In the 2010 NFL Draft, the San Diego Chargers traded up 12 spots to select the Butler in the third round. Butler suffered a season-ending injury prior to the start of his rookie season as he tore his left Achilles tendon during a pass rush drill. He was placed on the injured reserve list on August 31. The linebacker spent all of the 2010 season rehabilitating.http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/trainingcamp10/news/story?id=5438008 However, in the 2011 season, his first in the NFL, Butler had his breakout season as he became an immediate starter on the Chargers' defense. Butler had 96 tackles playing in all 16 games, including 2 sacks, 2 forced fumbles, and an interception, playing alongside veteran linebacker Takeo Spikes. In 2012, Butler was already a well-known and vocal team leader for the Chargers. Playing in only 12 games, he managed to make 77 tackles, 3 of which were sacks. He had a stellar game against the Kansas City Chiefs on September 30, where he caught a tipped off ball and returned the interception for a 21-yard touchdown. Butler was named AFC Defensive Player of the Week for that performance. Butler again was known as a team leader in 2013, being elected a team captain in his fourth year. Butler played 13 games, missing 3 with a groin injury, managing to make 84 tackles, half a sack, 1 interception, and a fumble recovery. In the wild card round vs the Cincinnati Bengals, Butler stripped running back Giovani Bernard from behind, which was ruled a fumble and recovered by the Chargers. Butler was an impending free agent for the 2014 NFL season, but on February 28, 2014, he announced on Twitter that he would be staying with the Chargers on a multi-year deal. He was placed on injured reserve with a dislocated elbow on December 15, 2014. Butler was released by the Chargers on March 3, 2016. Arizona Cardinals On July 27, 2016, Butler was signed by the Arizona Cardinals. On September 3, 2016, he was released by the Cardinals.

The LN-3 inertial navigation system is an inertial navigation system (INS) that was developed in the 1960s by Litton Industries. It equipped the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter versions used as strike aircraft in European forces. An inertial navigation system is a system which continually determines the position of a vehicle from measurements made entirely within the vehicle using sensitive instruments. These instruments are accelerometers which detect and measure vehicle accelerations, and gyroscopes which act to hold the accelerometers in proper orientation.  Background  LN3-2A Platform in historic environment The development of Litton's first INS was the result of a collusive act by the engineer, Max Lipscomb of the Wright Air Force Base in Ohio and Dr. Henry E. Singleton, Head of the newly formed Guidance and Control Dept. of Litton Industries at Beverly Hills, California. Lipscomb's department was not permitted to engage in development of navigation systems, but was permitted to engage in other aircraft avionics such as pitch, roll, and yaw indicators. Singleton proposed to provide a system that would provide highly accurate pitch, roll, and yaw indicators. The system would be a north seeking stable platform controlled by gyroscopes and accelerometers. Such a system would automatically provide velocities in the East-West and North-South direction. And later, by providing integrators for these two axes, one would then have a full-fledged Inertial Navigation System. In about mid-1956 a contract for approximately $300,000 was awarded by Wright Air Force Base to Litton Industries for the development of such \\"Aircraft Attitude System.\\" Singleton appointed Sidney Shapiro as Project Engineer for this program. The system was completed and ready for flight test by the end of 1958. Mr. Shapiro selected Paul Mantz, a partner in Tallmantz Aviation, to supply the aircraft, principally because of Mantz's extensive experience with the movie industry. They had done their work on several Cinerama travelogs. Mantz's people had also recently finished work on the picture \\"North by Northwest\\" starring Cary Grant in which there was considerable stunt flying. Shapiro's idea was to photograph the ground periodically and at the same instant to photograph the Inertial Navigation System's output. In that way no possibility of finger pointing was possible since none of Shapiro's people were involved in the data taking. So the two extra integrators were installed and the system was ready for test by early 1959. By 1959 things had gone well enough that Shapiro was able to obtain three successive flights in which the accuracies were substantially better than one mile an hour. On the basis of these results, Litton Industries was awarded a contract to provide 2000 systems for the F104 NATO Fighter Aircraft.Lipscomb and Wilbur (1965). The Cold War missile race spurred the development of smaller, lighter and more accurate inertial systems. Independent of its environment, the inertial system provides velocity and position information accurately and instantaneously for all manoeuvres, as well as being an accurate attitude and heading reference. The LN3-2A was the first inertial navigation system small and light and accurate enough to be fitted in a high performance fighter. The early F-104's, model A through F, did not have an Inertial Navigator. It was the development of the F-104G, around 1959, for the European Air Forces with tactical bomber/strike capabilities, that brought the LN-3 into the aircraft.Lambert (1963), p. 375. The LN-3 gave the F-104G the capability to navigate at low level in adverse weather and to drop a nuclear weapon at a range of 1,000 km with the best possible precision; this being vital to the F-104G program. The LN-3 is a full 3-degrees-of-freedom, 4-gimbal inertial navigator, covering the flight performance envelope of the F-104G which ranged from 0 to 70,000 feet altitude; 0 to Mach 2+ speed, and accelerations from ‚àí5 to +9 g.  Functional description  The functional description of the LN3-2A requires some knowledge of some basic principles of inertial navigation to understand their application to the LN3-2A. The principal component of the system is the stable platform to which are mounted three accelerometers and two gyros. This stable platform is mounted in a system of platform gimbals. The acceleration of the airplane in any plane or direction is measured by the accelerometers and integrated in the computer to obtain velocity. Velocities in turn are integrated to obtain distance. With a known reference point representing initial position of the airplane with respect to earth, this data can be converted to distance and heading traveled, and distance and bearing to destination.  Platform  The following characteristics of the platform are described:F-104G Starfighter Maintenance Manual. # Three accelerometers in orthogonal directions provide the basic sensing elements. They measure acceleration along the two grid coordinate axes and the vertical (Z) axis. The Z accelerometer is not used by the LN3-2A itself but provides vertical acceleration data for the automatic flight control system. The east-west and north-south X and Y axes are used for the LN3-2A. The accelerometer outputs torque the gyros in their sensitive axes, while the airplane is in flight, to maintain earth and grid north orientation of the stable platform through the platform gimbals. # Two gyros stabilize the stable platform and provide for various compensations to be introduced, keeping the stable platform level with respect to earth instead of inertial space, and providing a coordinate reference system of three axes. The gyros each have two degrees of freedom, and are oriented so that the spin axes are 90 degrees apart. The upper gyro has its spin axis oriented along the north-south grid coordinate axis and is sensitive to torques (airplane rotations) about the east-west and vertical coordinate axes. The lower gyro has its spin axis oriented along the east-west grid axis and is sensitive to torques about the north-south and vertical axes. Therefore, the two gyros control all three axes. # Platform gimbals are the assemblies which actually keep the platform accelerometers stable and enable the airplane to maneuver about the gyro-stabilized earth-oriented platform. The LN3-2A platform is a four-gimbal system (outer roll, pitch, inner roll and azimuth) allowing the airplane 360 degrees of rotation in all directions. The azimuth, pitch and outer roll gimbals use sliprings and brushes for electrical contacts to allow unlimited freedom. The inner roll gimbal provides a built-in redundancy to prevent a gimbal lock situation when the azimuth and outer roll gimbal axes become aligned at 90 degrees of pitch.  Computer  The LN3-2A computer controls the platform, computes navigational information and provides special AC and DC voltages required for equipment operation. The functions of the computer are: # to position the azimuth, pitch and roll gimbals of the platform. The basic sequence is that the gyro precession error due to airplane maneuvering is sensed and fed to the platform azimuth synchro resolver. The gyro signals are resolved into pitch and roll error voltages which are amplified in the computer. The computer drives the platform roll and pitch gimbal servo motors. The lower gyro is torqued to precess in azimuth to drive the azimuth gimbal motors. The upper gyro is caged to the lower gyro in azimuth. The gimbal servo motors position the gimbals to compensate for the original deviation. # to provide the voltages for the starting and running of the gyro spin motors. During the start of the system the gyros are brought up to spin speed by airplane 115 V AC, 400 Hz power. After the 1 minute coarse align phase the frequency source for the gyros is an electric tuning fork which provides a 3 kHz reference frequency which is divided by 8 to provide an operating frequency of 375 Hz and a running voltage of 90 volts. # to control the heating of the component oven, the platform, the gyros and the accelerometers. Some circuits within the computer, like amplifiers, require a very stable amplification factor which can only be maintained if certain components are kept at a precisely held temperature. These components are placed within the Component Oven at 71 ¬∞C. Also the gyros and accelerometers are kept at 71 ¬∞C ¬± 1.1 ¬∞C. The ambient atmospheric temperature inside the platform is maintained at 51.7 ¬∞C by a set of heaters and a circulating fan, and a motor driven cooling air valve controlling the flow of pressurized air through the double walled platform cover. # to compute velocity and distance information from acceleration. These navigational computations are performed with carefully designed electronic circuits in harmony with precision electromechanical components. The electronic parts are the Accelerometer Restoring Amplifier which give a voltage that is proportional to the acceleration. Ranging from micro-G's to units of G they span a very impressive dynamic range. Also the Servo Amplifiers, picking off the tiny Gyro signals and amplifying this to control the platform gimbal motors, have tight specifications. The actual integration of the accelerometer signal to a velocity signal is performed by an electronic amplifier which controls a velocity-motor which drives a capacitance tachometer. This cap-tach feedback provides the basic integrator signal since the speed of the cap-tach is proportional to acceleration input. The feedback nulls the acceleration input to stop the motor. The motor positions the velocity shaft to pick off the appropriate potentiometer signal which represents velocity. A dead zone network drives the velocity motor in steps which are smoothed to provide the integrated acceleration (= velocity) signal. The velocity integrators operate in a similar manner to the acceleration integrators, except that the output signal is not smoothed because the so-called M-transmitters are step-function devices. The M-transmitters send the integrated velocity (= distance) signal to the Position and Homing System PHI-4. # to sequence and control the coarse- and fine-align phases in conjunction with platform temperature. # to sense malfunctions to actuate the go, no-go circuitry of the inertial navigator. # Since the LN-3/PHI-4 navigation system is to be used around the globe of the earth, some systematic corrections for use on this rotating spheroid are implemented in the LN-3: Earth rate, Transport rate, and Coriolis correction. And to suppress inherent errors the system is Schuler tuned.  Operation of the LN-3  Before starting the Inertial navigator, the pilot has to enter the coordinates of the starting point in the \\"Align Control\\" panel in the right- hand console of the F-104G. The first selection in the starting sequence is to rotate the mode selector switch of the \\"Inertial Navigation Control\\" Panel from Off to Standby. In this mode the platform and component oven are brought up to operating temperature; indicated by the \\"heat\\" light on the IN Control Panel, which takes several minutes depending on outside and system temperatures. All at operating temperature the system may be switched to \\"Align\\", allowing the machine to commence operation. The computer is powered up and nulls its velocity shafts; the gyros are powered by 115 V and 400 Hz and revving up; the platform is levelled in pitch, inner and outer roll relative to the aircraft using the gimbal synchrotransmitters; and the azimuth axis is driven to the grid north direction using the magnetic heading sensor. This phase of Alignment takes 1 minute and is called coarse align. After this 1 minute the system switches to the fine align phase, during which the gyro spin motor power is brought down to 95 V and 375 Hz to avoid any magnetic interference with any other aircraft system using 400 Hz. The levelling of the platform is taken over by the X and Y accelerometers sensing even the smallest component of gravity which is an indication of not being precisely level. The levelling of the stable element is achieved by torquing the respective gyro torquers which makes the gimbal motors to follow up and level the stable element. The distance shafts are set to zero; the gyros are at operational speed and the computer is continuously feeding the gyros, and thereby the stable element, with corrections for local earth rotation. This is called the levelling phase of fine align. Leveling ends automatically when the computer decides that the platform stable element is exactly locally level, which may take a few minutes. If level, the final phase of alignment is switched on; gyrocompassing. The stable element is exactly level and Schuler-tuned but the gyros are not yet aligned with the earth rotation axis. Therefore, the stable element tends to turn off-level, which is sensed by the Y accelerometer which signal is fed to the gyro torquer to rotate the azimuth axis of the stable element. This process continues for a few minutes until the correction signal is getting smaller and can be kept almost zero for 50 seconds, which gives confidence that the system is level and aligned. This is visible for the pilot because the green Nav light flashes. The system is now ready for use and the pilot selects \\"Nav\\" on the IN Control Panel, and all circuitry that was involved in the various alignment phases is switched to the navigate mode. Other possible modes are Compass only which may be selected after a LN3 in- flight failure, and Alert Align to shorten the alignment phase. After the last flight but before shutting down aircraft power the precise heading of the running LN3 is stored and can be used at starting up the next time, if the aircraft is not moved.  Performance  Specified navigation accuracy for the LN-3 is a 50% circular-error probability (c.e.p.) of two nautical miles after one hour's operation, which is equivalent to a 98% c.e.p. of four nautical miles. Until the ‚àí9 version of the LN-3-2A came into service (~1963) results were outside these limits by a fair margin, but since then it has been greatly exceeded in a number of groups of flights. During manufacturer's development flying at Palmdale, some 1167 flights were made up to October 1961, and the c.e.p. of the LN-3 and PHI-4 combined was a mile or so outside specification. From October 1961 to January 1962 a further 123 flights at Palmdale were assessed, following incorporation of the ‚àí9 modifications, and the c.e.p. came almost up to specification. At Edwards AFB, during Category 2 testing, and at Palmdale during the \\"avionics marriage\\" period, mean time between failures of pre-9 systems was considerably below the 200 hr specified, but the target has been exceeded since then.Lambert (1963), p. 376. In november 1965 a LN-3 system was installed in a prepared Flying Tigers Boeing 707 (the Pole Cat) to conduct a pole to pole 51 hours flight, and compare its performance with other means of navigation. The quoted error at the South pole was 2 miles.  Genealogy  Litton Systems Inc., or Litton Industries, the Guidance and Control Systems Division at Beverly Hills CA, were one of the major producers of inertial systems in the USA in the 1950s and 1960s, and have made a series of systems for a number of American aircraft.Lambert (1963), p. 375. The Genesis of inertial navigation systems is explained in the following reference. * The LN-1 was a development attitude reference for the XB-70 Valkyrie.Bertram. * The LN-1A was a precision attitude reference for the Grumman E-1A Tracer.Lambert (1963), p. 375.Parsch (2008). * The LN-2A (military designation AN/ASN-31 or ‚àí36) was a Doppler-inertial system for the A-6A Intruder * The LN-2B was the system for the E-2A Hawkeye, * and the LN-2C was the system for the P-3A Orion.Lambert (1963), p. 375.Parsch (2008). * The LN-3-2A (or LN3-2A) was the Inertial Navigation System used in the F-104G Super Starfighter.

Improved versions of the LN3-2A were ‚àí9, ‚àí11 and ‚àí13.F-104G Starfighter Maintenance Manual. * The LN-3-2B is the Inertial Navigation System used in the Canadian CF-104.Lambert (1963), p. 375. * The LN-3-13 is fitted to the Italian F-104S/CI and F-104S/CB;Goebel (2017). enhanced variants of the F-104G from 1969 and onward. In the early 1980s a further upgrade led to the F-104S ASA version which kept the original LN-3; but the ASA-M version of the '90s was equipped with the LN-30A2 inertial navigation system.Baugher (2015). * The LN-4 is a miniature inertial system for \\"a manned orbital vehicle\\"Lambert (1963), p. 375. * The LN-5 is a (1963)\\"state of the art experimentation astro- inertial system installed in a Convair 340 R4Y \\".Lambert (1963), p. 375. * The LN-7 is an astro-inertial-Doppler system for a classified application.Lambert (1963), p. 375. * The LN-12A/B series are an evolution of the LN-3 and are used in F-4C (AN/ASN-48), the F-4D and F-4E (AN/ASN-63), the RF-4C (AN/ASN-56), all with slight differences.Anonymous (2005). The gimballed platform of the LN3-2A is the Litton P200 platform; the Gyro is the G200 Gyro; and the accelerometer is the A200 accelerometer.Lambert (1963), p. 375. (and Litton doc) The G-200 Gyro is commonly used in the LN-2, LN-3 and the LN-12 systems.Navhouse Corporation.  LN3-2A designation  Manufacturers designation of the F-104G system is LN3-2A. Mark the difference in notation LN-3 and LN3-2A with the position of the dividing dash \\"-\\" . The designation LN3-2A leaves room for a LN3-1, not known to author. Any additional information about the early Litton's is welcome!  Other US inertial systems of the early 1960s  The Litton LN-3 was one of the first inertial navigators on a production aircraft, but other systems, either inertial navigators or inertial measurement units, of other brands and for various applications with comparable technology existed. The Autonetics Radar Enhanced Inertial Navigation System (REINS) of the North American A-5 Vigilante was more or less comparable to the LN-3/PHI-4. This system was derived from the XN-6 system developed for the SM-64 Navaho, the N5G system for the AGM-28 Hound Dog and the N2C/N2J/N3A/N3B system for the XB-70, and was related to the N6A-1 navigation system used in the USS Nautilus (SSN-571) and the N10 inertial guidance system for the LGM-30 Minuteman. Note that the Boeing history claims the REINS to be the first inertial navigation in a production airplane. Nortronics had developed and produced Astro-inertial guidance/navigation systems for the SM-62 Snark. The system developed for the GAM-87 Skybolt was later adapted for use in the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird and mostly referred to as NAS-14 and/or NAS-21. The UGM-27 Polaris missile was equipped with a MIT- developed inertial system, which later evolved to the Delco produced IMU of the Apollo PGNCS. The Saturn V was equipped with a MSFC-developed ST-124-M3 inertial platform which was a further development of the PGM-19 Jupiter's ST-90. The Convair B-58 Hustler was equipped by AN/ASQ-42 Dopler-inertial system, made by Sperry Corporation.  LN-3 maintenance and test equipment  The LN-3 system was designed to constantly monitor critical parameters, and warn the pilot in case of a malfunction. Depending on the problem the pilot could switch-off the system, or continue in a dead reckoning mode. In case of serious self-diagnosed problems the system would auto shut-down.  Flight line maintenance  Flight line maintenance of the LN-3, like systemchecks and fault isolation, was performed using specific test equipment : System Test Console with Adapter and Computer, and Platform on pedestal at Volkel, NL * MATS (mobile automated test system) (RNlAF operated the MATS not at flightline but shop level.) * Line test analyzer * Gyro bias test set  Base level maintenance  At base (nav)shop level the platform, computer and adapter units were tested and repaired using the following test equipment : * System test console (STC). * Bench test console (BTC). Platform functional test console and platform on pedestal at DELM, Rhenen, NL  Depot level maintenance  For repairs beyond the capabilities of base level, the RNlAF Electronics Depot (DELM, at Rhenen) was equipped with specific testequipment and tooling to handle the (higher) depot level repairs of the LN-3 system. The main test stations in use were: * Platform functional test console (PFTC). * Module test console.  Industry support  The repair of the system's sensors, gyros and accelerometers, was performed by Litton. The RNlAF had its sensors repaired by Litton Canada, which also provided all necessary spare parts. Other European users relied on German or Italian subsidiaries/licensees as LITEF at Freiburg and Hamburg.Lambert (1963), p. 375.

Character conception Unlike other long-going series by Sunrise Productions, the Cyber Formula series seldom changes the major cast throughout the series. Most of the major characters were kept throughout the whole series while adding new characters throughout the production. The major difference to main casts to switching the main character role between Hayato Kazami and Bleed Kaga in Cyber Formula SIN. The brackets after the teams and cars are their active seasons, including official settings other than game variations. Main characters=Hayato Kazami  *Voice actor: Jun'ichi Kanemaru *Anime appearance: TV series, 11, ZERO, SAGA, SIN * DOB: March 28, 2001 *Nationality: Japan *Teams: Sugo Asurada (2015‚Äì2017), Sugo Winners (2018‚Äì2019), Sugo Grand Prix (2020‚Äì2021), Sugo GIO Grand Prix (2022‚Äì) *Notable entrants: Asurada GSX (2015), Super Asurada 01 (2015‚Äì16), Super Asurada AKF-11 (2016‚Äì2019), Garland SF-03 (2020), ŒΩ-Asurada AKF-0 (2020‚Äì2021), ŒΩ-Asurada AKF-0/G (2022‚Äì) is the main character in the anime series Future GPX Cyber Formula other than Cyber Formula SIN. Hayato was introduced to the world of Cyber Formula when by accident he became the registered driver of the Cyber Formula car Asurada, designed by his father while he recovered it from the hands of mercenaries. The Cyber System registers a unique user for the vehicle at the time of activation and the it would take a week to reformat the vehicle for another driver. This was not an option as the race was to be held much sooner. This forces the Sugo Grand Prix team to go with Hayato as the driver for the license race over the team's driver at the time, Akira Hiyoshi. After earning his license to compete in the Cyber Grand Prix, Kazami becomes the youngest driver to ever compete in the Grand Prix, at the time. His first season was successful, being the youngest driver to seize the World Championship title in his debut year by three wins and six podiums, including the stunning victory in Japan, overcoming the disadvantage of switching cars from Asurada GSX to Super Asurada 01 and stumbling at the beginning of the Grand Prix due to overconfidence and near-lack of racing skills. He and his team struggled in the following season's opener due to the high speed of development of other constructors. However, the development of Super Asurada AKF-11 and his driving skill would still prove strong against other opponents, especially Knight Schumacher (Osamu Sugo). He nearly abandoned the chance of becoming World Champion by requesting Osamu, who attempts to retire the race (due to an eye condition) to return to the track in final round. However, it turned out that all the leading drivers are throwing away their lead and race against them, Hayato barely beat Osamu, Shinjyo and Randoll in the final corner, winning the race and secured his second World Champion title. He started off well in 2017 following his second World Champion title, setting up a pole-to-win record in first four races, and likely to become the first person to have three World Championship titles. However, his discovery of \\"Zero-Realm\\" ability in the fifth race in England leads him to the serious accident, which not only ends his season but sends him to a near-fatal condition. Even in terms of points, he still ranked third (where Naoki Shinjyo was crowned World Champion). He would not be able to return the circuit until the fifth race in the 2018 season, but he would not overcome his ghost until the sixth race, where he would also make-use of the \\"Zero-Realm\\" to win the race. He successfully holds off Bleed Kaga to lead Sugo's Henri Claytor to get his first World Championship title, while he finished fourth in overall ranking. The aging of Super Asurada AKF-11 and development of other teams made him lose the title race again in 2019 season, and he abandoned his partner Asurada and driving Garland SF-03 at the beginning of 2020 season instead. However, the unsatisfactory result of such combinations would lead Kazami to return to Asurada, with a powered-up chassis v-Asurada AKF-0. The change proved to be a success by winning the 6 of the 7 remaining races in the season, and was crowned the historical first third World Champion (following Aoi's disqualification of doping and cheating in the race that season). The 2021 season would set his record champion points 76 (6 wins out of 12) after the reform of the Race Calendar and points and getting his 4th World Champion title. He loses much advantage in the title race in 2022 season by retiring 5 out of the first 8 races due to transmission problem (though he won the remaining three), although he would able to recover the deficit in the 11th race. The final-corner overtaking by Bleed Kaga (on OGRE AN-21) in round 12 would declare his failure of his title-defense with only 2 points. Asuka Sug≈ç *Voice actor: Kotono Mitsuishi *Anime appearance: TV series, 11, ZERO, SAGA, SIN *DOB: March 14, 1999 *Nationality: Japan *Teams: Sugo Asurada (2015‚Äì2017), Sugo Winners (2018‚Äì2019), Sugo Grand Prix (2020‚Äì2021), Sugo GIO Grand Prix (2022‚Äì) is the main heroine in the anime series Future GPX Cyber Formula. Sugo's team staff mainly in charge of communication of the team, but also takes the management role when the manager is out. She is the younger sister of Osamu Sugo and the daughter of Kojiro Sugo. She is also the childhood friend and fianc√©e of Hayato Kazami. When Karl Lichter von Randoll entered Cyber Formula racing, he saw Asuka and fell in love with her. Asuka and Hayato had an engagement in the Zero OVA, but because of Hayato's betrayal of his promise to not race anymore, she threw the engagement ring back at him. In the end, she forgave him for what he has done and studied abroad at Columbia University to become a doctor to protect Hayato as well as all those other people who are racing. Originally, Asuka fully backed up Hayato in the TV series and the Double One OVA, but since the accident met by Hayato in the opening of Zero, she feels more uncomfortable throughout his participation of Cyber Formula. Although she trusts him and his actions in the race, she could never feel peace; especially when he was versing Phill (Al-Zard NP-1) and Kaga (Orge AN-21), which was created by Nagumo and his brother. In the Double One OVA, she is also worried about her brother, driving as Knight Schumacher, who had his eye condition worsened due to an accident in the past. Throughout the OVAs, it is shown that Hayato and Asuka has many instances slept together; most notably when they were sleeping naked in episode 4 of the SIN OVA. This is also shown, through the fact that she is willing to wear a bath robe after taking a shower in front of him. However, in one episode of the TV series, she beats him away when he accidentally saw her wearing a towel after taking a shower. At the end of the SIN OVA, it is shown that Hayato and Asuka were getting married in which all the acquaintances from the Cyber Formula world has appeared in the background to celebrate the wedding. Asurada *Voice actor: Kenichi Ono The computer navigation system created by Hiroyuki Kazami, Hayato's father, is the most advanced system in the world of Cyber Formula, said to be able to analyse emotions and continue to evolve. It was designed as opposite to the Ogre Cyber System developed in 2019. Once Asurada was finished, Smith from Missing Link, where Hiroyuki Kazami worked in, tried to obtain this system even to create weapons of mass destruction. But Hayato Kazami has registered himself as the only driver of Asurada in order to flee the system from Smith's men. However, as it has a unique security feature of it, Asurada only responds to the first person contacting with it and no additional driver can be added. And Hayato has to replace Akira Hiyoshi as the driver of Sugo to participate in the Fujioka preliminaries. The system's biggest drawback is its unique security feature. Although additional persons can be added in communication purpose, driving orders must be taken by the driver himself and cannot be changed. Akira Hiyoshi, original driver of Asurada GSX, could not drive the car and leaves the team afterwards. When Hayato suffered a serious accident in the 2017 season, the Sugo team cannot find any driver to replace him with, and directly leads to the development of non-Asurada operated Garland SF-01. On many occasions, Asurada has been abandoned by Hayato, but every time they meet again, Asurada forgives him and swears that they'll forever be partners. Asurada is still proved superior even has been used for 7 years. In 2021 and 2022 season its chassis, v-Asurada AKF-0 would still get an overall first and second places, respectively. Naoki Shinjyo *Voice actor: Hikaru Midorikawa *Anime appearance: TV series, 11, ZERO, SAGA, SIN * DOB: October 28, 1998 *Nationality: Japan *Teams: Aoi Formula (2015‚Äì2019), Union Savior (2020‚Äì2022), Aoi ZIP Formula (2023‚Äì) *Notable entrants: Superion GT (2015), Fire Superion G.T.R. (2015), Fire Superion GTO-15B (2016), Ex-Superion Z/A-8 (2016‚Äì2019), Issuxark 00-X3 (2020‚Äì2022), AL-Zard NP-2 (2023) Ex-Zard Z/A-11 (2024‚Äì) is a supporting character in the anime series Future GPX Cyber Formula. Naoki Shinjyo is a highly successful two-time European F3 Champion before making the switch to Cyber Formula racing after being scouted by Aoi Formula boss, Kyoko Aoi. After passing the Japanese qualifying rounds he makes his debut in America during the 2015 season with high hopes for both him and his team. He starts his season well in podiums early in his second race, and he would win in the fourth round. However, when Sugo reveals the newest Super Asurada 01, his pride towards himself would make him struggle after an engine blowout in that round. He continues to struggle after Hayato and Union Savior's youngster Karl Richter von Randoll both defeats him and suffered a second retirement despite having the new Fire Superion. His slump was further deepened when Aoi Formula was demoted to the 2nd team while the original team manager Kyoko Aoi sets up the \\"Aoi ZIP Formula\\" in the 7th round. However, he bounced back after Miki Jounouchi blamed him for having no respect to mechanics and his attitude towards his poor driving skills. He finished 5th, 3rd and 1st in the following three races. He would finish in second place in overall that year, only barely losing to Hayato in the very final moment in Japan Round. In the 2016 season, he starts off well with the upgraded Fire Superion GTO-15B until the introduction of Knight Schumacher to Aoi, but he would still be finished in second overall again, although he was throwing away his lead along with the other leading drivers in order to establish the final duel with Knight Schumacher, making Hayato the final winner of the race. He was crowned the World Champion title in 2017 as the aftermath of the exit of two main rivals Hayato and Randoll due to an accident in the British Grand Prix. However, he struggled in the start of 2018 season and almost was fired by Aoi, only a race with Kaga's assistance and his accidental discovery of \\"Zero-Realm\\" made him win the Asian Grand Prix and saved him from being fired. At the end of the season, Miki Jounouchi, who developed a romantic relationship with Naoki, transferred to Aoi to be the chief mechanic of Aoi and the partner of him. He was dismissed by the Aoi team after losing a large margin to the Al-Zard NP-1 in a test session before the opener of the 2020 season. He would be spending most of the remaining season in NASCAR with Miki. By Randoll's idea, they disguised like former teammate Knight Schumacher and joined Union Savior in the 11th race that season as a \\"special driver\\". Although their identity was blown off by Hayato and Asuka in public and would have to drive with his real name, he would take revenge on Fritz, beating him and finished 1‚Äì2 with Randoll. He and Miki would be staying the 2021 and 2022 season in Union Savior until 2023, when Bleed Kaga, the only driver of Aoi ZIP Formula retired. The two returned to Aoi, partnered with Seiichirou Shiba, former test driver of Sugo Winners.

It was also featured on the demo No Life 'Til Leather. It was the first song the band recorded in a studio. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" has been frequently performed at the group's concerts since its live debut in 1982 and had been Metallica's closing song from the Madly in Anger with the World Tour to the Metallica By Request Tour. It is the third-most performed song in the band's history, having been played 1,525 times as of October 2019, behind only \\"Creeping Death\\" (1,533) and \\"Master of Puppets\\" (1,670). During the 2004 documentary film about Metallica, Metallica: Some Kind of Monster, the song is used when footage of the band down the years is shown highlighting the progression in the group's appearance and sound over time. In AOL Radio's list of the 10 Best Metallica Songs, \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was ranked at number 4, and Allmusic's Steve Huey chose the song as an AMG Track Pick from Kill 'Em All. Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the song was placed on the list of post-9/11 inappropriate titles distributed by Clear Channel. Writing and inspiration The song is about feeling the urge to kill, but not literally doing it. During the Kill 'Em All for One Tour, Hetfield would jokingly say that it was about hunting. It is said to be heavily influenced by the Diamond Head song \\"Dead Reckoning\\". The first three mini-solos are derived from the song \\"Princess of the Night\\" by Saxon. Metallica added the final solo. Since the song's debut on Kill 'Em All, Hammett has apologized for the unusual pitch of the string bend which occurs at 3:47 to 3:48, during the solo. It is, in fact, a mistake or \\"bum note\\". Live performance The song has become a fan favorite and has been played at virtually every Metallica concert since the band's inception. It is usually played as a closing number for its live performances since the Madly in Anger with the World tour, with Hetfield often asking the audience to sing along with him; he shouts \\"Searching,\\" and they shout \\"Seek and destroy!\\" During the Wherever We May Roam Tour, \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was played with Jason Newsted singing vocals; however, at the end of the song, the band would commence in a jam for nearly seven minutes until Hetfield took the microphone and continually had the audience sing the lines \\"Seek and destroy!\\". He also went to the edge of the barriers holding off the crowd and got them to sing the lines individually. The song length went from an average of seven minutes to an average of 16 to 20 minutes for the elongated concert version of the Black Album tour. During the Shit Hits the Sheds Tour in 1994, the song would be introduced as a new song that Newsted wrote and would include an extended jam, that would include one of the main riffs of \\"The Outlaw Torn\\". From 2004 to 2015, it became a regular closing song at the end of the band's set. From 1983 to 1994, the song was played in E standard tuning. From 1995‚Äì2000 and for two shows in 2002 and 2013, respectively, it was played in E flat tuning. It was played in D standard tuning from 2000 to 2015. Starting again in 2015, it was played in E flat tuning. When played live, Hetfield (in the past also Newsted) often changes the beginning lyrics \\"in the city tonight\\" by replacing \\"the city\\" with the name of the town in which they are performing.See for example: Since 2004, bassist Robert Trujillo has done a spinning technique with his bass guitar after the guitar solo of the song before the last verse. Notably, Seek & Destroy was the last song ever played at N√ºrburgring before the location of the Rock am Ring festival was moved elsewhere. A performance of the song with Burton on bass in 1985, is available on the DVD Cliff 'Em All. Newer live versions can also be found in the Live Shit: Binge & Purge box set (with Newsted singing the lead vocals on the Mexico City CDs and the San Diego DVD) and the Cunning Stunts DVD when played in the Kill/Ride Medley. Use in sports The song was also the theme song of former WCW, TNA and WWE wrestler Sting and former AAA wrestler Cibern√©tico. In Sting's case, the song was a live recording from Woodstock '99 which would be included on the 1999 compilation WCW Mayhem: The Music. Since 1991, the San Jose Sharks of the National Hockey League have used Seek & Destroy as their entrance theme, as many of the band members are Sharks fans.http://video.sharks.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=733192 The Pittsburgh Penguins, St. Louis Blues, Edmonton Oilers and the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League also use the song as their entrance theme during home games. As of 2010, it is being used as the home theme song for the Australian rugby league team, the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. In attempt to end his batting slump, White Sox baseman Gordon Beckham began using \\"Seek & Destroy\\" as his introduction theme in May 2010, replacing The Outfield's \\"Your Love\\". Zoic Studios created a television commercial for NASCAR that features \\"Seek & Destroy.\\" It aired in May 2010. Covers * 1992: Acid Drinkers (Strip Tease) * 1992: Kontrol (Lele kako!

This young deacon in the Christian community of Jerusalem was sentenced to death by stoning. The painting was influenced by the art of Caravaggio and Adam Elsheimer. It represents the moment when Stephen was stoned outside the city by his many tormentors (about twenty characters), and he utters his last words to Christ as the light around him shows that the heavens are open. The painting is divided into two distinct zones with a diagonal creating an effect of chiaroscuro: on the left, a man on horseback is in the shadow, and on the right, Stephen and his persecutors are in the light. Saul of Tarsus can be seen seated in the background holding in his lap the coats of the stoners. Some inaccuracies in the drawing can be seen. The character behind Stephen seems to be a self-portrait done into a wider composition, as Spanish painter Diego Vel√°zquez did in Las Meninas.

The former pond estate of Wallnau lies on the west coast of the Baltic island of Fehmarn and covers, in its core zone, an area of just under , of ponds, reed beds and meadows as well as part of the Baltic Sea and its fringing beaches. The nature conservation centre houses an exhibition on bird migration, a small restaurant and seminar rooms. Paid and volunteer workers look after conservation-related work and public relations. The centre is certified as the provider of education for sustainable development.  History  The area, which consists of ponds, reed beds, wet meadows and small groves of trees, was originally a bay in the Baltic Sea before a spit developed and separated what became an inland lake from the sea 400 years ago. In the 19th century the area was drained by engineer and surveyor, Gustav Kr√∂hnke, and numerous fish ponds were created over an area of . The drained lake was used for a long time for agricultural purposes before it was purchased in 1975 by the German Society for the Protection of Birds (Deutscher Bund f√ºr Vogelschutz)Today the German Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union (Naturschutzbund Deutschland or NABU) and the district of Ostholstein. NABU bought the site in 1976 and, by 1977, it had been designated as a nature reserve. This secured the protection of breeding and migrant bird species. In order to optimise the habitat for these birds, landscaping measures were carried out in several areas. The reserve also took part in a LIFE project for improving the protection of the Baltic Sea lagoons, cooperating with Danish and Swedish partners. The head of NABU's Wallnau Waterbird Reserve since March 2008 has been Malte Siegert. In March 2010 NABU Wallnau was given responsibility for three other nature reserves on Fehmarn, thus creating a linked conservation system on the island. One reserve lay just to the north of NABU's existing nature reserve of Wallnau/Fehmarn. The two others are located between the Wallnau Nature Reserve and the NABU's Krummsteert-Sulsdorf Wiek / Fehmarn Nature Reserve. The peninsula of Spitzenort and the islands in the Lemkenhafener Wiek, which are home to inter alia a large colony of herring gulls, will also be looked after by NABU Wallnau in the future. The reserves fall under the EU's Birds Directive and are Special Areas of Conservation in the Europe-wide conservation network known as Natura 2000. In 1970 the Love and Peace Festival, a music festival lasting several days took place on the edge of the present NABU reserve. This event was the last one at which Jimi Hendrix performed before his death. Today, a memorial stone commemorates the event.  Wallnau / Fehmarn Nature Reserve  On 23 December 1977 ownership of the site, designated as a nature reserve by the state of Schleswig-Holstein, was transferred to NABU.  Conservation  Over 270 species of bird use the terrain of the nature reserve as a resting area during their migration. Around 100 species breed in Wallnau. Data from the continual waterbird numbers and mapping is archived and passed on to the collection points. Employees of the reserve carry out tasks for the Nature Conservation Service of the state of Schleswig Holstein. The team of the waterbird reserve undertakes specialist support of the Wallnau nature reserve and the site support of the reserves of Gr√ºner Brink and Krummsteert/Sulsdorfer Wiek on the island. Information board  Importance  Because of its favourable location on the migration path of migrating birds, Wallnau is a much sought-after resting place and is also used as a nesting ground in the summer by rare birds like the red-necked grebe and little tern. The nature reserve can be viewed at any time from a path on the crest of the summer dyke. NABU's information centre is open from March to October and there are also guided walks through the area.

St. Catherine's Church, Hamburg in 1930. The church was damaged by the bombing in World War II and rebuilt afterwards. Johann Melchior Goeze (born 16 October 1717 in Halberstadt, died 19 May 1786 in Hamburg, epithet: Zionsw√§chter, i.e. Zion's Guardian) was a Lutheran pastor and theologian during the period of Late Orthodoxy. From 1760 to 1770 he served as senior of Hamburg presiding as spiritual leader over the Lutheran state church of the city-state. Life Goeze studied in the universities of Jena and Halle, writing a doctoral dissertation on early Christian apologetics. In 1741, he became the pastor in Aschersleben, Principality of Halberstadt. In 1750, he took his ministry to Magdeburg, Duchy of Magdeburg, and from 1755 onwards he served as the pastor at St. Catherine's in Hamburg. The pastors of the five principal or head churches (Hauptkirchen) of Hamburg formed a college, the Spiritual Ministerium, and elected from their midst the spiritual leader of the Lutheran state church. In 1760 his colleagues elected Goeze senior of Hamburg. Goeze was familiar with literature and took up writing histories and apologetics. The latter led him to write against various proponents of the Enlightenment. In 1764, he wrote against Johann Bernhard Basedow, in 1769, against Johann Georg Schlosser, in 1771 against Johann Salomo Semler, the founder of the historical critical method, in 1773, against Karl Friedrich Bahrdt, and in 1769 against Julius Gustav Alberti, the first Rationalist pastor in Hamburg. The next year, in 1770, he published his best work, The True Nature of Religious Zeal. Goeze became well known chiefly for his debate with Gotthold Ephraim Lessing from 1777 to 1781. Goeze urged him to repentance, but little came out of the debate. Lessing responded with a number of rather polemical texts, finally resulting in Lessing being prohibited from writing on religious matters. Privately, Lessing showed respect for Goeze by always making sure to visit him when he came to Hamburg.

In 1865 the Society, including its equipment and staff, was incorporated into the fire brigade run by the Metropolitan Board of Works, which became the precursor to the modern London Fire Brigade. The Society has continued to exist and now recognises people who perform acts of bravery in rescuing others from the life-threatening effects of fires in the United Kingdom.The Society for the Protection of Life from Fire History The Society for the Protection of Life from Fire was formed in 1836, it received royal patronage in 1837 but lost it again in 1901 when King Edward VII declined to renew it after the death of Queen Victoria. In its 1837 annual report, the society stated its purpose as ‚Äúthe preservation of Life from Fire, by organising a body of men who shall be provided with‚Ä¶ public fire escapes‚Ä¶ and also by exciting Fireman, Policemen and others to a prompt attention to the scene of danger ‚Äì by holding out rewards, as the merit of the case may deserve‚Äù.Society for the Protection of Life from Fire, First Annual Report of the Society (1837) Its main work at this time was the provision and maintenance of fire escapes at around seventy central London locations. This extract from Cruchley's London in 1865: A Handbook for StrangersCruchley's London in 1865:A Handbook for Strangers provides an excellent outline of the work being undertaken by the Society: In 1865 the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Act placed the responsibility of providing an efficient fire brigade onto the Metropolitan Board of Works and the equipment and staff of the society were absorbed into the new organisation. Consequently, by 1908 the remit of the society had changed, and was now stated as, ‚Äúpromoting the Protection of Life from Fire, by the grant of rewards for saving life from fire, to persons who shall have distinguished themselves or received injury while engaged in the rescue of life from fire‚Äù.Society for the Protection of Life from Fire, Annual Report of the Society (1908) This specific definition of its work, with an emphasis on the risk to life or exertions of the rescuer rather than just the attempt to save life, places the organisation into the realms of recognising heroism, rather than simply promoting or endorsing lifesaving. This sentiment was originally suggested by one of the five ‚Äúspecific objects‚Äù of the society which was, ‚Äúto bestow rewards, at the discretion of the Society, on such persons as shall at any time distinguish themselves by their endeavours to save human life in case of fire‚Äù.Society for the Protection of Life from Fire, First Annual Report of the Society (1837) These awards included certificates, watches, monetary awards and in particularly meritorious cases, a medal. The medal, which was awarded in silver and bronze, contained a design of oak branches encircled by the words ‚Äúduty and honour‚Äù and ‚Äúthe Society for the Protection of Life from Fire‚Äù on the obverse and a representation of a group of figures undertaking a rescue from a fire on the reverse. An indication of the quantity, scope and reach of the society‚Äôs awards can be ascertained by looking in depth at particular periods. For example, between 1908 and 1914, the Society recognised 547 individuals with awards including eighty-one bronze medals, forty-six silver medals, eighteen silver watches and 293 certificates.John Price, Everyday Heroism: Victorian Constructions of the Heroic Civilian (Bloomsbury: London, 2014) , p.135 The Society made awards to women far more often than any other comparable organisation recognising heroic acts. This may have been because fires often took place in domestic settings where women were more present or because of the flammable nature of women‚Äôs clothing.John Price, Everyday Heroism: Victorian Constructions of the Heroic Civilian (Bloomsbury: London, 2014) , pp.142-43 In addition to lifesaving, awards were also presented in relation to the design or construction of new fire escape equipment and to individuals who were the first to bring existing equipment to the scene of a fire. However, it was the awards for directly saving life, and at personal risk, which were most admired. At one 1837 presentation ceremony, for the bestowal of silver medals for ‚Äúpraiseworthy conduct‚Äù, it was noted that, ‚Äúpresenting the medals to the persons to whom they were awarded, produced a gratifying and interesting sensation on the minds of the assembly, which was very numerous; and those who received them‚Ä¶ returned thanks, appearing to value them as an inestimable treasure‚Äù.Society for the Protection of Life from Fire, First Annual Report of the Society (1837) Present day The Society has continued to exist and now recognises people who perform acts of bravery in rescuing others from the life- threatening effects of fires in the United Kingdom.The Society for the Protection of Life from Fire It encourages police forces and fire brigades to report such acts and to nominate, for formal recognition by the Society, those who act heroically in fires. The Society‚Äôs awards normally take the form of a framed certificate testifying to ‚Äòdistinguished conduct while engaged in the rescue of life from fire‚Äô or in especially meritorious cases, a medal is awarded. For people under the age of 16 there can also be a small monetary award. The principal consideration for the Society‚Äôs Trustees, when considering nominations, is that the persons nominated must have exposed themselves to the hazard of fire and smoke while attempting to rescue one or more people. Nominations are accepted from chief constables and chief fire officers in the United Kingdom or senior police or fire brigade officers. In exceptional cases, nomination from a third party may also be considered. Nominations are to be made by post or email, using the Society's official application form. While they always consider exceptional cases, the Trustees do not normally make awards to a close relation of a victim, someone receiving another national award, or a serving fire officer or police officer, unless they were off-duty or their action was above and beyond what is expected in the normal course of their duty. The Society‚Äôs records, up to and including 1998, were previously stored at Guildhall Library in the City of London and are now kept at London Metropolitan Archives (LMA). LMA have a basic enquiries service which is free for information about the records they hold and the services they supply. All basic enquiries will be answered in order of receipt, whether they are email, fax, telephone or letter enquiries.

This arises out of the presumption that Christian belief is a social norm, that leads to the marginalization of the nonreligious and members of other religions through institutional religious discrimination or religious persecution. Christian privilege can also lead to the neglect of outsiders' cultural heritage and religious practices. Overview Christian privilege is a type of dominant group privilege where the unconscious or conscious attitudes and beliefs of Christians advantage Christians over non-Christians. Examples include opinions that non-Christian beliefs are inferior or dangerous, or that those that adhere to non-Christian beliefs are amoral, immoral, sinful, or misguided. Such prejudices pervade established social institutions, are reinforced by the broader American society, and have evolved as part of its history. Lewis Z. Schlosser observes that the exposure of Christian privilege breaks a \\"sacred taboo\\", and that \\"both subtle and obvious pressures exist to ensure that these privileges continue to be in the sole domain of Christians. This process is quite similar to the way in which whites and males continue to (consciously and unconsciously) ensure the privilege of their racial and gender groups\\". There is a hierarchy of Christian privilege in the United States. White mainstream Protestant denominations have greater degrees of privilege than minority Christian denominations. Such groups include African American churches, Christian Hispanics and Latinos, Amish people, Mennonite, Quakers, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, adherents of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Christian scientists, Mormons, and in some instances, Catholics. When the dominant Christian groups impose their cultural norms, values, and perspectives on people with different beliefs, those people are seen in social justice terms as oppressed. These values are imposed \\"on institutions by individuals and on individuals by institutions\\". These social and cultural values define ideas of good and evil, health and sickness, normality and deviance, and how one should live one's life. The dominant group's social values serve to justify and rationalize social oppression, while the dominant group members may not be aware of the ways in which they are privileged because of their own social identity; \\"unpacking\\" McIntosh's allegorical knapsack of privilege (of any kind) is to become aware of and to develop critical consciousness of its existence and how it impacts the daily lives of both those with and those without this privilege. History Alexis de Tocqueville the French political scientist and diplomat, traveled across the United States for nine months between 1831‚Äì1832, conducting research for his book Democracy in America. He noted a paradox of religion in the U.S. On the one hand, the United States promoted itself around the world as a country that valued both the \\"separation of church and state\\", and religious freedom and tolerance. On the other hand, \\"There is no country in the world where the Christian religion retains a greater influence over the souls of men than in America\\". He explained this paradox by proposing that with no officially sanctioned governmental religion, Christian denominations were compelled to compete with one another and promote themselves in order to attract and keep parishioners, thereby making religion even stronger. While the government did not support Christian churches as such, Tocqueville argued that religion should be considered the first political institution because of the enormous influence that churches had on the political process. Although de Tocqueville favored U.S. style democracy, he found its major limitation to be in its limiting of independent thought and independent beliefs. In a country that promoted the notion that the majority rules, this effectively silenced minorities by what Tocqueville termed the \\"tyranny of the majority\\". Without specific guarantees of minority rights‚Äîin this case minority religious rights‚Äîthere is a danger of religious domination over religious minorities and non-believers. The religious majority in the U.S. has historically been adherents of mainline Protestant Christian denominations who often assume that their values and standard apply equally to others. Another traveler to the United States, social theorist Gunnar Myrdal examined U.S. society following World War II, and he noted a contradiction, which he termed \\"an American dilemma\\". He found an overriding commitment to democracy, liberty, freedom, human dignity, and egalitarian values, coexisting alongside deep-seated patterns of racial discrimination, privileging of white people, and the subordination of peoples of color. This contradiction has been reframed for contemporary consideration by the religious scholar, Diana Eck: Christian hegemony The concept of hegemony describes the ways in which a dominant group, in this case mainly U.S. Christians, disseminate their dominant social constructions as common sense, normative, or even universal, even though most of the world's inhabitants are not Christian. Christian hegemony also accepts Christianity as part of the natural order, even at times by those who are marginalized, disempowered, or rendered invisible by it. Thus, Christian hegemony helps to maintain the marginality of other religions and beliefs. According to Beaman, \\"the binary opposition of sameness/difference is reflected in Protestant/minority religion in which mainstream Protestantism is representative of the 'normal'\\". The French philosopher, Michel Foucault, described how a dominant-group's hegemony is advanced through \\"discourses\\". Discourses include the ideas, written expressions, theoretical foundations, and language of the dominant culture. According to Foucault, dominant-group discourses pervade networks of social and political control, which he called \\"regimes of truth\\", and which function to legitimize what can be said, who has the authority to speak and be heard, and what is authorized as true or as the truth. Pervasiveness Christian privilege at the individual level occurs in proselytizing to convert or reconvert non-Christians to Christianity. While many Christians view proselytizing as offering the gift of Jesus to the non- Christians, some non-believers and people of other faiths may view this as an imposition, manipulation, or oppression. Social institutions‚Äîincluding but not limited to educational, governmental, and religious bodies‚Äîoften maintain and perpetuate policies that explicitly or implicitly privilege and promote some groups while limiting access, excluding, or rendering invisible other groups based on social identity and social status. Overt forms of oppression, when a dominant group tyrannizes a subordinate group, for example, apartheid, slavery and ethnic cleansing, are obvious. However, dominant group privilege is not as obvious, especially to members of dominant groups. Oppression in its fullest sense refers to structural or systemic constraints imposed on groups, even within constitutional democracies, and its \\"causes are embedded in unquestioned norms, habits, and symbols, in the assumptions underlying institutional rules and the collective consequences of following those rules\\". Christian dominance is facilitated by its relative invisibility, and because of this invisibility, it is not analyzed, scrutinized, or confronted. Dominance is perceived as unremarkable or \\"normal\\". For example, some symbolism and rituals associated with religious holidays may appear to be free of religion. However, this very secularization can fortify Christian privilege and perpetuate Christian hegemony by making it harder to recognize and thus circumvent the constitutional requirements for the separation of religion and government. Christian privilege and religious oppression exist in a symbiotic relationship. Oppression toward non-Christians gives rise to Christian privilege, and Christian privilege maintains oppression toward non-Christian individuals and faith communities. Criticism According to Schlosser, many Christians reject the notion that they have any privilege by claiming that all religions are essentially the same. Thus, they have no more and no fewer benefits accorded to them than members of other faith communities. Blumenfeld notes the objections that some of his university students raise when discussing Christian privilege as connected with the celebration of Christian holidays. The students, he notes, state that many of the celebrations and decorations have nothing to do with religion as such, and do not represent Christianity, but are rather part of American culture‚Äîhowever, this could be considered a further example of privilege. Similarly, some claim that the religious significance of cultural practices stems not from Christianity, but rather from a Judeo-Christian tradition. Beaman argues that \\"this obscures the pervasiveness of anti-Semitism in the modern world\\". Some claim that the concept of Christian Privilege is a misnomer. James Madison, in his first significant public act, objected to the use of \\"toleration\\" in the article, believing that it implied that religious liberty was a grant from the state that could be revoked at will. The Virginia Convention agreed, and Article XVI was amended to make it clear that \\"the free exercise of religion\\" is a right, not a privilege granted by the state.Daniel L. Dreisbach, Mark D. Hall, and Jeffry H.

Mark David Hall, Ph.D., argues, \\"The Founders of the United States believed it permissible for the national and state governments to encourage Christianity, but this may no longer be prudential in our increasingly pluralistic country. Yet the Constitution does not mandate a secular polity, and we should be wary of jurists, politicians, and academics who would strip religion from the public square. We should certainly reject arguments that America's Founders intended the First Amendment to prohibit neutral programs that support faith- based social service agencies, religious schools, and the like.\\"Did America Have a Christian Founding?, http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/2011/06/did-america-have-a-christian- founding#_ftn29 Scholars and jurists debate the exact scope of religious liberty protected by the First Amendment. For instance, it is unclear whether the amendment requires religious minorities to be exempted from neutral laws. (For example, does the Free Exercise Clause require Congress to exempt religious pacifists from conscription into the military?) But at a minimum, it prohibits Congress from, in the words of James Madison, compelling \\"men to worship God in any manner contrary to their conscience\\".Dreisbach and Hall, Sacred Rights, p. 427.

She batted and threw right-handed.Lillian Faralla. All- American Girls Professional Baseball League. Retrieved 2019-04-12. A brief history The early 1940s saw unprecedented numbers of women entering the public realm in numerous traditionally male occupations. The World War II left scores of businesses, including baseball, without adequate labor. Driven by the fear that Major League Baseball would be shut down for the duration of the war, Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley created a women‚Äôs league as a backup plan to keep baseball alive. The circuit existed from 1943 to 1954. It eventually became known as the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL). Early life A native of San Pedro, California, Faralla started playing softball when she was 14 years old for a team in her hometown. She played for six years with four different teams in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, being traded back and forth a couple of times when other teams had injuries, because she was able to fill in since she played a number of positions. A hard-throwing pitcher, she also appeared at second base, third, and right field. AAGPBL career Faralla entered the league in 1946 with the Peoria Redwings, playing for them one year before joining the Fort Wayne Daisies (1947), South Bend Blue Sox (1948‚Äì1949), Kalamazoo Lassies (1950), and coming back to South Bend (1951). She posted a career-high 19 victories in 1949, but her career milestone came in 1949, when she pitched two no-hitters in that season. She reached the playoffs with the Blue Sox in all three seasons she played for them, including the championship team in 1951.SABR Biography Project ‚Äì Article by Jim Sargent \\"Women should have their own league (...) The game should be adapted for women players (...) Enjoying something you like to do and getting paid for it\\", Faralla recalled in an interview. It was the lessons of baseball, taught by AAGPBL managers as Bill Allington, that the women would remember most about their time in the field of play. After the circuit folded in 1954, many of them would go on to coach softball and baseball themselves for schools and other organizations with teams.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: Pioneers in Their Own Right ‚Äì Clement C.

Early life Martin grew up in Southern California. He attended Lynwood High School and then Magnolia High School in Anaheim. He then attended Cypress College before transferring to San Diego State University, where he began working at campus radio station KCR-FM. Martin's first experience in the entertainment industry was in 1968 on the Art Linkletter Show, on the segment known as \\"Kids Say The Darndest Things\\". Career Upon completion of college, Martin was hired by KGB-FM in San Diego, where he worked from 1978 to 1988, with a one-year break in between to work at KMET-FM in Los Angeles in 1986‚Äì1987. In 1988, Martin accepted a job at KRXQ-FM. He has run the midday shift (10 am to 3 pm) since August 8, 1988. He has the longest running consecutive show in Sacramento radio history. In 2010 radio historian and author Alex Cosper wrote about Martin in his article \\"Sacramento Radio History\\" from the web site \\"playlistresearch.com\\": 'Not many radio personalities last a long time at one station. Sacramento's rock stations KRXQ and KSEG have been the best at hanging on to air talent. Under Station Manager Jim Fox, Pat Martin programs the music, decides on new music and has been doing the same airshift at the same station longer than anyone else in Sacramento. He has been doing middays at KRXQ since August 1988. In 2010 Pat Martin reveals the secret to his longevity: \\"I'm constantly evolving and know how to be a role player. I've been the PD here a couple of times, then not the PD. I don't self-implode, just roll with the changes. But mainly I've made myself, by design, a valuable air talent for KRXQ. I know that every day I have to re-prove myself and earn my place here, and that's what I do. It also helps to have heritage at a station. The listeners consider me a friend, a familiar voice they can tune into day after day. It's a comfort level with the audience that's hard to duplicate.\\"' In a 2013 interview with music website All Access, Martin stated, ‚ÄúIn Sacramento, I am generally known as the guy who put Tesla (band) back together. It happened in 2000.

Description and historical notes  Autumn view of the mmountain from Caprieto The summit of the mountain during the Middle Ages was occupied by a castle, which has almost totally vanished today. In its place is now found a sanctuary dedicated to the Madonna of Loreto, built between 1858 and 1868. Attached to the religious structure there is a small shelter present, which is always open and equipped with 8 bed stations. A rural cableway on the Scrivia side it utilized in case of the need to transport materials. Its relatively modest altitude notwithstanding, Monte Reale is, thanks to its isolated position and distance from taller mountains, an exceptional panoramic point. On clear days, the range may be observed from the forts of Genoa to the Maritime Alps and from Monte Rosa to the Adamello, and it may be seen as far as Corsica.

It has neuroprotective effects in animal studies, and was trialed in humans for reducing brain injury following head trauma. It was subsequently trialed up to phase II for treatment of stroke, but while side effects were mild and consisted mainly of nausea, repinotan failed to demonstrate sufficient efficacy to justify further clinical trials. However, repinotan continues to be investigated for other applications, and was found to be effective at counteracting the respiratory depression produced by morphine, though with slight reduction in analgesic effects.  History  Bayer Healthcare AG (Wuppertal, Germany) first synthesized repinotan during early 2000s. As of 2004, it was expected to be filed by the NDA. Phase III trials for both ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury were run in March 2002. However, these trials found the drug ineffective as a treatment (November, 2009). In October 2010, further investigation showed repinotan able to counteract respiratory depression caused by morphine. Repinotan continues to be examined, but has not yet been commercially released.  Chemical and Physical Properties  2-D Structure of Repinotan Hydrochloride Repinotan is an enantiomerically pure aminomethyl chromane derivative with a saccharinylbutyl substituent. It is classified as a synthetic organic and possesses five hydrogen bond acceptors and one hydrogen bond donor. Its topological polar surface area is 84.09 and it has seven rotatable bonds. In addition, its molecular weight is 400.15 g/mole. Repinotan has a formal charge of zero and a covalently-bonded unit count of one. It is similar in chemical and physical properties to the ligands quetiapine, PAT5A, and pioglitazone.  Synthesis  Bayer Healthcare AG synthesized Repinotan in three main reaction sequences. A form with a metabolically stable 14carbon- label was necessary for pharmacokinetic studies. The hydrochloride was hydroxylated in the 6-position of the chromane moiety.  First Reaction Scheme  For the first reaction sequence, [14C]-phenol was used as the starting compound. Michael adduct formation was then employed in the preparation of chromane rings with [14C]-phenol.  Second Reaction Scheme  In the second reaction sequence, [Carbonyl-14C]-2-hydroxy-acetophenone was used first. Compound XII was formed from condensation of [carbonyl-14C-]-2-hydroxy-acetophenone with dimethyl oxylate and ring closure. Hydrogenolytical debenzylation and hydrochloric acid created the final product.  Third Reaction Scheme  The third reaction involved intermediate XVII undergoing acylation using acetyl chloride. Deacetylation and debenzylation were then implemented with HCI. Pd/C was used in the deacetylation step and Pd/C was used in the debenzylation step.  Mechanism of Action  Repinotan HCI (BAYx3702) acts as a highly selective 5-HT1A receptor full agonist. It is blocked by the specific 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY 100135 and its primary metabolizer is CYP2D6. Ethnic differences are known to have an effect on CYP2D6. Repinotan is believed to operate through neuronal hyperpolarization. When repinotan first binds to both pre- and post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors, G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels are activated. This causes hyperpolarization. Because hyperpolarization causes inhibition of neuron firing and less glutamate release, neurons are protected against overexcitation. This could explain repinotan's neuroprotective properties. In addition, the protein Bcl-2, the serotonergic glial growth factor S-100beta, and Nerve Growth Factor are affected by repinotan. Repinotan is able to suppress caspase-3 through MAPK and PKCalpha. Apoptosis as a result of anoxia/reoxygenation and H(2)O(2) treatment may also be inhibited. Repinotan has been found to bind with high to moderate affinity to the receptors alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic, 5-HT7- and 5-HT1D, dopamine D2 and D4, sigma sites, and 5-HT2C. It is able to increase activity of VTA dopaminergic neurons and medial prefrontal cortex dopamine release.  Pharmacology = Pharmacodynamics  Repinotan acts as a selective high-affinity full receptor agonist at the 5-HT1A receptor subtype. It increases the activity of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area as well as DA release in the medial prefrontal cortex. Additionally, it is an extremely potent drug and is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. After infusion, the distribution equilibrium between plasma and brain is reached almost instantaneously. Repinotan's efficacy is mainly dependent on factors such as the length of time between the start of stroke symptoms and taking the drug. The age and blood pressure of the patient also plays a role. Decreases in response with increasing age as well as decreases in response as blood pressure increases are generally observed. The most efficient dose is approximately 1.25 mg per day.  Pharmacokinetics  Repinotan's primary route of administration is by intravenous injection, which indicates that it goes directly into the bloodstream. It is able to cross the blood-brain barrier- a highly selective barrier that separates circulating blood from the brain's extracellular fluid. Diffusion acts as the driving force, which allows repinotan to cross in both directions. In addition, the drug is uncharged, which is consistent with the fact that it is able to pass the lipophilic and non-polar blood-brain barrier. The half-life of repinotan is approximately 1 hour. Elimination ensues in parallel from plasma and brain. In addition, repinotan's volume of distribution at steady-state and plasma clearance are independent of dose. This is indicative of linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 0.1-3.0 micrograms repinotan/kg/h. Infusion rates of up to 150 microg/h are well received. Repinotan's optimal dose is 1.25 mg/day.  Potential Effects of Gender and Age on Repinotan's Administration  Gender and age do not have any influence on repinotan's pharmacokinetics. Bodyweight also does not play a big role.  Treatment = Acute Ischemic Stroke  Repinotan was originally developed by Bayer Healthcare AG (Wuppertal, Germany) as an oral treatment for depression. However, it was instead trialed as a candidate for reducing brain injury following head trauma. The drug was then examined as a preventative of secondary brain damage for ischemic stroke victims. Early trials showed repinotan's ability to reduce hippocampal CA1 and CA3 neuronal loss. Cortical tissue damage was also reduced. In addition, repinotan was shown to mitigate spatial learning deficits. However, trials were discontinued due to repinotan's efficacy being insufficient.  Respiratory Depression  Repinotan Dose Relationship to Nociception Repinotan has presently been found to be effective at stopping respiratory depression caused by morphine. In addition, it represses nociception at high doses, but enhances nociception at small doses (0.2 micrograms/kg). Repinotan may be applicable to Parkinson's, as it is able to reduce glutamate-induced excitotoxicity and thereby some cell death.  Additional Medications Trialed  Another stroke medication trialed at the same time, picozotan, is similar to repinotan in that it is also a serotonin agonist. Other drugs included zonampanel, which acts as an AMPA receptor antagonist instead of a 5-HT1A receptor agonist and DP-b99. DP-b99 is a metal iron chelator.  Side Effects  Repinotan's side effects during trials as a treatment for ischemic stroke consisted mainly of serotonergic side effects including nausea and vomiting. The most common side effect was headache. Neurological worsening, cerebral hemorrhage, and brain edema were the most common severe effects. However, repinotan was generally shown to be safe. Its current investigation as an antagonist for respiratory depression caused by morphine has shown there to be no serious cardiovascular side effects. However, a slight decrease in blood pressure was a more minor effect. Repinotan has been linked with pupil diameter reduction.  Original Predictions and Current Availability  Currently, repinotan is not commercially available in the United States. Sales of $1000 million in the U.S. and a launch date of 2006 were originally anticipated by Lehman Brothers. Bank Vontobel and Bayer both estimated sales of 450 million Euros. However, the drug continues to be under investigation for different treatments than its original intent.

Gordon England was one of the early pioneers of gliding, and his glider flight in 1909 is considered to be the birth of the sport of soaring. Early years Gordon England was born in Argentina in 1891, the son of British parents George and Amy England. He emigrated to England at age ten, and he was first educated at New College, Eastbourne; then from 1904 to 1906 at Framlingham College in Suffolk. He then started an engineering apprenticeship with the Great Northern Railway works at Doncaster becoming a fellow-apprentice of W O Bentley. Early aviation and gliders The glider Olive, in 1909 In 1908, he left the railways for his first job in aviation, working as an assistant for Noel Pemberton Billing who was trying to establish a flying ground at South Fambridge in Essex. While working for Pemberton Billing he met Jos√© Weiss, who designed and built tailless gliders, and England became an assistant to Weiss. On 27 June 1909, England flew a Weiss glider (named Olive after one of Weiss's five daughters), at Amberley Mount, Sussex, on a height-gaining flight that reached 100 feet. It is the first recorded soaring flight, and is considered to be the birth of the sport of Gliding. Aviator, designer and engineer Lee-Richards Annular Monoplane No. I before its only flight 23 November 1913 In 1911, Gordon England taught himself to fly at the Bristol flying school at Brooklands, and he gained Pilot Certificate No. 68 in three hours. Later in 1911, he joined the Bristol Aeroplane Company as a staff pilot, but was soon recognised as a designer. One of his first design tasks was to convert a Bristol T-type biplane into a tractor design, which was then named the Bristol Challenger-England. This conversion was followed by three biplanes (the G.E.1, G.E.2 and G.E.3), all designed by England. In August 1912, the G.E.2 was flown by England in the Military Aeroplane Trials at Larkhill. England left the Bristol company, and in 1912 in association with James Radley produced the Radley-England waterplane; it was the first three-engined aircraft built in the United Kingdom. England also built and tested the Lee-Richards Annular Wing Monoplane. Between 1913 and 1916, he was a test pilot and consultant engineer to a number of aircraft constructors, mainly on the English south coast, including J. Samuel White and Company and White and Thompson. In 1916, he became the factory manager for Frederick Sage & Company, which was building Short-designed seaplanes and Avro 504Ks under licence. Motor racing, car building and later life In 1919, Gordon England left Frederick Sage & Co to become a consultant, and started an interest in motor racing. In 1922, with his father George, he became interested in building bodies for the Austin Seven sports cars. Using his skills gained with aircraft, he designed and patented a new lightweight body made from plywood box-girders and an ash framework covered with thin plywood panels. In 1925, he entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans race using one of his own designs, but he failed to finish. By 1927, over 20,000 Austin Sevens had been built with England bodies. He incorporated the company as Gordon England (1929) Ltd, but with the increase in the use of metal bodies, the firm eventually closed in 1930. England became manager of the automotive lubricants department at the Vacuum Oil Company 1930-1935. He was managing director of General Aircraft Limited 1935-1942, and chairman of the Engineering Industries Association 1940-1944. General Manager, Eugene Ltd, 1945‚Äì1950.

Alloys These alloys commonly contain manganese and zinc, but there are other combinations known. Some common alloys are named HK31, HM21, HM31, HZ32, ZH42, ZH62; where the \\"H\\" indicates that the alloy contains thorium. Magnesium alloy names are often given by two letters following by two numbers. The two letters indicate the main elements present in the alloy where A = aluminum, Z = zinc, M = manganese, S = silicon, etc. the numbers tell percentage compositions of the two elements. So, AZ31 would indicate that there is 3% aluminum and 1% zinc in the alloy. Magnesium-thorium alloys have been used in several military applications, particularly in missile construction. The most noted example of this is the ramjet components in the CIM-10 Bomarc missile and Lockheed D-21 drone, which implemented thoriated magnesium in their engine construction. This is due to thoriated magnesium alloys being lightweight, having high strength, and creep resistance up to 350 ¬∞C. But, these alloys are no longer used due to radiation concerns involving thorium's radioactivity. This has resulted in several missiles being removed from public display. Similarly, the structure of the Equipment and Retro-Rocket Modules of the Gemini spacecraft (the white-painted portions) were made of thoriated magnesium for their strength-to-weight ratio and thermal properties. These were not part of the inhabited cabin, though the radiator tubing, whose silicone coolant flowed through the cabin, was also made of the same material. All examples burned up in the atmosphere upon reentry. Another concern for the thoriated magnesium alloys is the low melting point and rapid oxidation of the metal. This can result in dangerous flash fires during the production of the alloys. Additionally, thorium-free magnesium alloys have been developed that exhibit similar characteristics to mag-thor, causing currently used magnesium-thorium alloys to be cycled out of use.

It is comparable to the Selden Society, an organisation devoted to the study of English legal history. Society The Society has around four hundred and fifty members from Scotland and around the world. The Society holds an annual general meeting in November, which includes a guest lecture. Recent distinguished figures to have addressed the Society included Alan Watson, Rogers Professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, and John H.

The Society is run by a Council, chaired by Professor John Cairns, Professor of Legal History at the University of Edinburgh School of Law. The President of the Society is Lord Stewart. As part of its aim of furthering study Scots legal history, the Stair Society produces printed and electronic publications, specifically an annual volume along with occasional other publications. The Society's Literary Director is Mark Godfrey, Professor of Legal History at the University of Glasgow School of Law. The Society also provides a postgraduate scholarship to support someone undertaking doctoral research (i.e. leading to degrees of Ph.D. or D.Phil.) in the area of Scots legal history. The scholarship has had one successful graduate so far but is currently suspended. Viscount Stair James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair, generally known as Viscount Stair, was an important political figure in seventeenth century Scotland and served as Lord President of the Court of Session from 1671 to 1681 and 1689 to 1695.

The company's website allows users to add a percentage of their monthly expenditure which is then donated to charity. The website allows customers to then disperse that amount to as many charities as desired, and is the first major initiative to match what a person spends to their level of charitable donation. As of June 2011 Xperedon has over 5250 different charities in 25 countries available to support listed on its website, however new charities can be proposed by anyone. Xperedon does not charge charities for being listed on its website. Personal Charity Plan The Xperedon system is based on its users building their own Personal Charity Plan. This plan allows customers to specify details about the way in which they donate, including; the amount they give, which charities they give to, and the way in which those donations are distributed. Once the user has chosen how much to give in total, and the list of charities they wish to give to (their Charity Portfolio), they can opt either to distribute their total donation between those evenly, or weight their donations in favour of one or more particular charities. Customers control who they give to, the amount they give, and how the amount is spread. Xperedon then takes care of all of the administration and settlement with the charities. Customers can choose to prioritise their donations, offering a higher percentage to a particular charity, and can alter this amount at any time, for example increasing aid to African charities in a particularly bad year of famine. Xperedon calls the amount a particular customer decides to give their \\"uplift\\". Xperedon users can opt to be known to the charities they donate to or to remain completely anonymous. CardLink 'CardLink' is a technology by Xperedon that allows customers using a Personal Charity Plan to link their credit or debit card spending to their charity plan. The system allows customers to match the nature of charitable donations with the nature of a customer's spending, rather than giving a set amount per month. Customers can also choose to link the way they spend to the way in which they give. For example the Charity Plan can be set up to specify that the donation \\"uplift\\" on card expenditure on petrol automatically leads to that attributed donation being directed to an environmental charity. Likewise, if a customer spends ¬£100 in a restaurant, a ¬£1 donation could automatically be made to a charity that prevents famine.

It was directed by Stephen Lee Davis, and written by Jack Burditt and Tracey Wigfield. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on March 18, 2010. Guest stars in \\"Don Geiss, America and Hope\\" include John Anderson, Scott Bryce, Marceline Hugot, James Rebhorn, and Michael Sheen. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) attempts to avoid running into Wesley Snipes (Sheen) after they fail to hit it off in their first encounter, but fate seems to want them together. At the same time, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) deals with the impending purchase of NBC. Finally, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) does damage control after his former nanny publishes a tell-all book. The episode continued a story arc involving Wesley as a love interest for Liz, which began in the previous episode. \\"Don Geiss, America and Hope\\" makes reference to the real-life acquisition of NBC Universal by cable company Comcast, as well as that of professional golfer Tiger Woods' extramarital affairs scandal. This episode of 30 Rock has received generally positive reviews from television critics. According to the Nielsen Media Research, it was watched by 6.857 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 3.0 rating/9 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. For his performance in \\"Don Geiss, America and Hope\\", Alec Baldwin received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination in the category for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. Plot Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), outgoing Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric (GE), researches company Kabletown (which recently purchased the NBC network as a charitable, tax-deductible act), to find a way he can contribute in the corporation's development. NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) lets it slip that he may have been living forever, when he shows concern that Kabletown may impose new rules for \\"age limits and age verification\\" for pages. A former colleague, Dave Hess (Scott Bryce), who left NBC for Kabletown, reveals that Kabletown's success comes from running pay-per-view adult channels; the company runs \\"the perfect business\\" and needs no investment in new services or products. On learning this, Jack is horrified at the prospect of no longer making things. Later, however, while giving a eulogy at former GE CEO Don Geiss's (Rip Torn) funeral, he has an epiphany and proposes to Kabletown executives that they produce \\"porn for women\\" (specifically, channels featuring attractive men who \\"listen\\" while women blather on). Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) tries to avoid meeting with Wesley (Michael Sheen), the British man she met and flirted with while under the influence of anesthesia. Liz finds him to be annoying, but they continually run into each other, which leads them to believe they are meant to be together. However, after visiting the dentist office where they met, Liz and Wesley come to terms with the fact that the anesthesia was the cause of whatever they experienced, and agree to stop seeing each other. But when they run into each other yet again, Wesley suggests that they should probably just \\"settle\\" for one another. Liz is horrified at this prospect and consults Jack for advice, but he is still disconsolate at the prospect of \\"settling\\" for a company without upward momentum, and cannot help her. Later, Liz meets Wesley to tell him her answer is no, and she believes both of them can do better than being with each other; she is further dismayed to learn he shares his name with actor Wesley Snipes. Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) nanny publishes a tell-all book, revealing that he has never actually had an affair with anyone, a secret he had shared only with Jack in \\"The Ones\\". In order to restore his womanizing persona, Tracy holds a press conference announcing he is leaving show business to spend more time with a stripper, but no one is convinced. To make matters worse, women begin to come forward and admit that they did not have sex with Tracy. His wife Angie even advises him to have an affair in order to save his career, a suggestion which Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) urges him to take seriously. Tracy attempts to proposition Liz, but is unable to pretend he wants to cheat on his wife. Liz rebuffs Tracy's advances, admitting she envies his happy marriage and urging him to embrace his monogamy. At the end of the episode, Liz is seen watching and being intrigued by some of the \\"porn for women\\" content, which somehow features her fantasy boyfriend Astronaut Mike Dexter.

Overall, this was Burditt's twelfth writing credit. This was Wigfield's third writing credit, and was Davis's first directed episode. \\"Don Geiss, America and Hope\\" originally aired in the United States on March 18, 2010, on NBC as the fifteenth episode of the show's fourth season and the 73rd overall episode of the series.

Save Picture as ‚Üí Right click file ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Summary ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Date Picture Taken In January 2010, it was announced that Welsh actor Michael Sheen would guest star as a love interest for series creator Tina Fey's character, Liz Lemon. He made his debut as Wesley in the previous episode, \\"Future Husband\\". Actor Scott Bryce guest starred as Dave Hess, a former colleague of Jack Donaghy's. Bryce first appeared in the season three episode \\"Flu Shot\\" as a different character named Michael Templeton. Actress Marceline Hugot made her ninth appearance as Kathy Geiss, the daughter of GE CEO Don Geiss. In the episode, Kathy performs Ellens dritter Gesang by Schubert with a trumpet at her father's funeral. Dr. Kaplan was played by actor James Rebhorn, who first guest starred as the character in \\"Future Husband\\". At the end of \\"Don Geiss, America and Hope\\", where Liz is shown watching one of the \\"porn for women\\" channels, the man depicted as speaking to her was portrayed by actor John Anderson, who has guest starred previously on the show as Astronaut Mike Dexter. At the end of the credits, Anderson is credited as Astronaut Mike Dexter. Jack learns from former GE CEO Jack Welch, in the last episode, that current GE CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn) has died. In \\"Don Geiss, America and Hope\\", a funeral service is held for Geiss. Television critic Bob Sassone of TV Squad, in his recap of this episode, wondered if Torn was written out of the series due to an alcohol-related incident that occurred to Torn in January 2010. This episode was inspired by the real-life acquisition of NBC Universal by cable company Comcast in November 2009. After winning her fourth Screen Actors Guild Award as her 30 Rock character at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards ceremony in January 2010, Fey was asked whether or not the show would make reference to the Comcast acquisition to which she said that it would be dealt with. \\"The sale of NBC to another company is integral to our show and it will be hard for Jack.\\" In the episode, Kabletown‚Äîa fictional Philadelphia company network‚Äîhas taken over GE Sheinhardt NBC Universal, and Jack tries to contribute his ideas to the company. In April 2010, the NBC network created a website for the Kabletown company. When asked by a contributor from The Philadelphia Inquirer why the characters on 30 Rock refer to the network's new owner as \\"Kabletown, with a K\\", co-showrunner and executive producer Robert Carlock revealed that the reason for this was that the staff writers came up with the name \\"Cabletown\\", however, they later learned that there was a real company with a similar name, so NBC's legal team department \\"wanted to emphasize the difference, and after a while, everyone just liked the sound of it.\\" alt=Tiger Woods, an African- American male in his early-30s, looks serious and wears a white hat and blue greyish polo shirt. On both his hands, he holds a golf club, after swinging it, and sports a white glove on his left hand. Tracy Jordan's storyline in which his former nanny writes a tell-all book revealing that he has never actually had an affair with anyone mirrored‚Äîthough in reversal‚Äîthe real life of professional golfer Tiger Woods' extramarital affairs scandal that occurred in late 2009. In one scene, it is revealed that women have come forward admitting to never have had a sexual relationship with Tracy; After news broke of Woods's infidelities, numerous women came forward admitting to having affairs with the golfer. To re-establish his womanizing persona, Tracy holds a press conference announcing he is leaving show business to spend more time with a stripper; In December 2009, Woods announced he would take an indefinite leave from professional golf to focus on his marriage after he admitted infidelity. Other women, who Tracy did not have a relationship with, have released voice mails to the news media. In one of them, Tracy leaves a message to his wife, Angie (Sherri Shepherd), in which he is loving and sincere in the message; One of Woods's mistress produced voice and text messages as evidence of a relationship with the golfer. As a result of him being outed as monogamous, Tracy loses various endorsements; After admitting to his affairs, Woods lost various endorsement deals with different companies. Cultural references In the beginning of the episode, Jack announces at a staff meeting that NBC has been bought by Kabletown, a company network from Philadelphia. Immediately, Jack and Liz exchange opinions about Philadelphia and Boston; Liz, who grew up near Philadelphia, declares \\"Go Eagles! Philly rules! Cheesesteaks! Bobby Clarke! Will Smith! [Boston] sucks!\\". Jack, who is from Boston, responds \\"Boston is the greatest city in the world. Boston Tea Party. Boston cream pie. Boston Rob Mariano. Birthplace of Benjamin Franklin.\\" Liz interjects \\"Yeah, then [Franklin] looked around, realized it sucked, and moved to Philadelphia!\\" Jack and the New York staff then deride the city of Los Angeles, provoking an NBC executive teleconferencing in from Los Angeles to assert that \\"LA rules: Michael Bay, freeways, Legoland‚Äî\\" before Jack shuts off his feed. While meeting with Kabletown executives, Jack learns that they focus on adult films and sees their list of features, including Assatar, The Lovely Boners, The Hind Side, and Fresh-Ass: Based on the Novel Tush by Assfire, puns on the 2009 films Avatar, The Lovely Bones, The Blind Side, and Precious: Based on the Novel \\"Push\\" by Sapphire. Jenna claims to Tracy that she \\"ate the pig that played Babe,\\" in a reference to the 1995 film Babe based on the British novel The Sheep-Pig. At Don Geiss's funeral, the trumpet solo that his daughter Kathy Geiss (Marceline Hugot) performs is Ellens dritter Gesang by Franz Schubert, a melody best known as a setting for the Latin Catholic prayer Ave Maria. When Liz tells Tracy that he has a life with his family and should enjoy it, after Tracy tries to have sex with her in order to restore his womanizing reputation, she tells him \\"You know what I have? A Sims family that keeps getting murdered.\\" The Sims is a video game in which players create virtual people called \\"Sims\\" and places them in houses and helps direct their moods and satisfy their desires. Tracy responds \\"One day, you will have what I have because you are an amazing, strong, intelligent woman, like Hilary ... from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\\" The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was a series that previously aired on NBC, and the Hilary character was a dull-witted individual who lacked intelligence. Before going their separate ways, Liz discovers that Wesley's last name is Snipes, but Wesley tells her that it is a name more fitting for a \\"pale English guy\\", than actor Wesley Snipes. Liz and Wesley also attend a second run of the movie Hot Tub Time Machine, which provokes arguments between them despite their mutual enjoyment of the film. Star Wars is frequently referenced in 30 Rock, beginning with the pilot episode in 2006 where Tracy is seen shouting that he is a Jedi. Liz admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars, saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia during four recent Halloweens, and while trying to get out of jury duty in Chicago and New York. Star Wars is also referenced when Tracy takes on the identity of the character Chewbacca. In this episode, at Don Geiss's funeral, he is shown to be frozen in carbonite similar to that of Star Wars character Han Solo in the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back. Fey, a fan of Star Wars herself, said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference \\"started happening organically\\" when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference \\"in almost every show\\". Fey said that from then on \\"it became a thing where [they] tried to keep it going\\", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a \\"pretty high batting average\\". Fey attributed most of the references to executive producer and writer Robert Carlock, whom she described as \\"the resident expert\\". Reception alt=Alec Baldwin speaking at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con International in San Diego, California. According to the Nielsen Media Research, \\"Don Geiss, America and Hope\\" was watched by 6.857 million viewers during its original United States broadcast. The rating was a 3 percent increase in viewership from the previous week's episode, \\"Future Husband\\", which was seen by 5.894 million American viewers. The show claimed a 3.0 rating/9 share among viewers aged 18 to 49, meaning that 3.0 percent of all people in that group, and 9 percent of all people from that group watching television at the time, watched the episode. For his work in this episode, Alec Baldwin received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination in the category for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards, but lost it to actor Jim Parsons. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger wrote that despite \\"Don Geiss, America and Hope\\" not being \\"strong\\" as the last episode it had \\"many funny moments scattered throughout\\" that he was satisfied with. He noted that the uncomfortable relationship between Liz and Wesley \\"worked better\\" here than previously. Sepinwall said it \\"was a good story\\" for Jack's character, and that it was \\"nice\\" to see 30 Rock \\"fearless about mocking their future Comcast overlords as they are at making fun of NBC\\". The A.V. Club's Nathan Rabin enjoyed Michael Sheen's return, said that every part of Liz and Wesley's story was \\"brilliant\\". He observed that Jack's midlife crisis here was \\"poignant as well as funny.\\" Overall, Rabin gave it a B+ rating, and concluded \\"...it was a rock-solid episode\\". Despite enjoying Sheen's role on the show, Time contributor James Poniewozik confessed he had a problem with his story arc with Tina Fey's Liz. \\"I assume that [Sheen] is not going to become a permanent cast member, and so however much I might enjoy parts of this story, I can never forget that this is probably one more relationship that Liz will go through and end up at status quo ante.\\" Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was complimentary towards the NBC/Kabletown deal, enjoyed Tracy's subplot, noting it gave the character \\"something important to do ... it also shined some new light on the Tracy Morgan character.\\" Adam Mersel for TV Guide reasoned \\"I can officially say that almost no episode of 30 Rock falls flat for me, and this one certainly didn't [...] All in all, this is one of my favorite episodes of the season.\\" Paste magazine contributor Sean Gandert was favorable to it, noting \\"I'm not sure when the last time I thought every plot in a 30 Rock episode was a winner, but 'Don Geiss, Hope and America' delivered on the exuberant claims of the episode's title\\". Nick Catucci of New York magazine wrote that Jack trying to fit in at Kabletown, along with his suggestion of \\"porn for women\\", was \\"meh\\", Liz dealing with Wesley and Tracy \\"dealing with the world's discovery of his fidelity to his wife\\" were all \\"quite comfortably situated in the show's wheelhouse\\". Not all reviews were positive. IGN contributor Robert Canning felt that \\"Don Geiss, American and Hope\\" felt \\"a bit rudderless as well. The main stories eventually crossed over in meaningful ways, but aside from those connections, their direction was a bit weak and unsure. They all had a great bit or two ... but the general feel of the episode was mostly blah. That could likely be the result of the main characters coming off as mostly blah.\\" In conclusion, Canning gave it a 7.5 out of 10 rating. Meredith Blake, a contributor for the Los Angeles Times, was not positive towards Fey and Sheen's story here, explaining that the premise of the two characters settling for one another \\"fell flat\\" and \\"it just wasn't as funny as it could have been.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:30 Rock (season 4) episodes Category:2010 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about funerals ","title":"Don Geiss, America and Hope"},{"id":"26620528","text":"Simpson Springs is a spring, former Pony Express station, former Civilian Conservation Corps camp, and campground in southeast Tooele County, Utah, United States. Description The springs are located about south of Dugway and about west of the town Vernon, on the southeastern corner of the Dugway Proving Ground. The site lies on the Simpson Springs Road portion of the historic Pony Express Trail and is situated Simpson Springs lies at an elevation of about on a bajada of the northwest flank of the Simpson Mountains, on the eastern edge of Dugway Valley, and has long been a water source on the trail west from Salt Lake City across the desert regions. (The Simpson Buttes lie a few miles to the west within the Dugway Proving Ground.) The Bureau of Land Management maintains a campground in the area. History The site was undoubtedly used by Native Americans and possibly the Fremont Indian cultures due to its good water supply. The old river bed several miles west has provided evidence of indigenous activity. The springs were first called Egan Spring for explorer Howard Egan, but renamed Simpson Springs for Captain James H. Simpson following his work to establish a military mail route to California in 1858. Simpson Springs was established as an Overland Mail station by George Chorpenning for mule train connection between Salt Lake City and Sacramento. It later became an important Pony Express, Overland Stage, and later, Wells Fargo stations on the trail through Utah desert. The station was discontinued after completion of the first Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. It continued to be used for local freight between Fairfield and Ibapah into the 1890s. The location was used as a Civilian Conservation Corps camp in the late 1930s and early 1940s. In January 1942, the U.S. military established Dugway Proving Ground in the area, which was occupied by military personnel through World War II. The existing building on the site was built by the Future Farmers of America as a replica in 1975. Simpson Springs gained national attention 2009 in connection with suspicious circumstances involving the disappearance of Susan Cox Powell in December of that year. She was last seen alive on the 6th and her husband, Joshua Powell, reported that later the same night (shortly after midnight) he had taken his two young sons camping at Simpson Springs and left her sleeping at their house in West Valley City, Utah. Law enforcement searched the Simpson Springs area later that week, but did not find anything. Susan has not been seen since, nor have her remains been found. (Fourteen months later, on February 5, 2012, Josh Powell and his two sons were killed in an apparent murder‚Äìsuicide in Graham, Washington.)

The part of the route from Shrewsbury to Bromfield is signed - the remainder of the route is currently unsigned. The section from Shrewsbury to Leominster is advertised as the Six Castles Cycleway. The six castles on or near the route are (in geographical order from north to south): Shrewsbury Castle, Bishop's Castle, Stokesay Castle, Ludlow Castle, Richard's Castle and Croft Castle. Route=Shrewsbury-Bromfield The route begins in Shrewsbury, one mile west of the town centre, where it links up with National Cycle Route 81. The formal start point of the route is on Shelton Road (the B4380), at the junction with Woodfield Avenue, where route 81 exists on its way between Shelton and the town centre. Route 44 heads southeast along the B4380 to Longden Road Roundabout, where it turns off onto Longden Road out of Shrewsbury, passing the Priory and Meole Brace secondary schools. The first village outside of Shrewsbury is Hook-a-Gate. After passing through Hook-a-Gate and the neighbouring hamlet of Annscroft, the route turns off along country lanes to Arscott and then Shorthill, where it meets the A488. The route crosses over the main road and along country lanes again to the large village of Pontesbury, where again it meets the A488. After Pontesbury the route again follows country lanes and heads south to Habberley and then after this village, west to Minsterley, where the route again meets the A488. The route then heads along the B4499 to Priest Weston, on the Shropshire-Wales border, passing to the west of the Stiperstones hills. It briefly enters Powys, including the village of Churchstoke (or Church Stoke), where it meets the A489. After Church Stoke, the route is on country lanes again and heads roughly southeast to the small (English) town of Bishop's Castle. After passing through Bishop's Castle and crossing the A488, the route then roughly runs southeast to Craven Arms, passing to the north of the village of Lydbury North and running through the hamlet of Round Oak. At Craven Arms the route crosses the Marches railway line and the busy A49 to the hamlet of Halford, after which it runs along the B4368 east-bound for a short distance, before heading south on a country lane to Onibury and after that village, southeast on another country lane, passing through Ludlow Racecourse and Golf Club, before reaching the village of Bromfield. At Bromfield is the Ludlow Food Centre and the route meets the A49 again. Bromfield-Cinderford After Bromfield it passes just to the west of the historic market town of Ludlow and then continues in a southerly direction into Herefordshire, first to Leominster (where the route goes through the town) and then to Hereford, where it joins up with National Cycle Route 46. After Hereford, route 44 heads in a roughly southeast direction to Cinderford, via Ross-on-Wye. At Cinderford it links up with National Cycle Route 42. Regional Route 32/33 Originally the National Route 44 was planned to go Shrewsbury-Church Stretton-Craven Arms (and then continuing to Cinderford as above) but the section from Shrewsbury to Craven Arms was re-routed via Bishop's Castle. Instead the original Church Stretton route is now designated as a (West Midlands) regional route, numbered either 32 or 33. It is at present unsigned, but appears for example on the Six Castles Cycleway leaflet. This regional route is not yet signed along the route. The first stage of signing is expected to be Shrewsbury to Church Stretton and would begin at Greyfriars Bridge close to the centre of Shrewsbury (where it connects with national route 81) and end at Church Stretton railway station, a length of around 15 miles. Almost all the route in on country lanes, as well as the cycle path along a disused railway trackbed in Shrewsbury, which takes the route across the Rea Brook and through Sutton Farm. The route however has to cross the busy A49 road and also runs for a short distance along the A458 near Shrewsbury. Between Shrewsbury (Coleham) and Church Stretton, the route passes through the villages and hamlets of Betton Strange, Condover, Great Ryton (and Little Ryton), Longnor and All Stretton.

He was born in Zlonice, Bohemia, 23 June 1726, and died in Prague, Bohemia (present day Czech Republic) 19 December 1792. Originally a career bureaucrat in Habsburg state service, he inherited the family properties and title following the deaths of his father and his uncle in 1749, and the childless death of his cousin in 1752. Upon his succession, he left state service and joined the Habsburg military. He distinguished himself in several battles of the Seven Years' War, particularly at the battles of Lobositz and Kolin. He retired from the military in 1778, just prior to the War of the Bavarian Succession, to care for his widespread estates in Moravia, Bohemia, and Vienna. He died in 1792. Family and career His father, Count Philip Kinsky of Wchinitz and Tettau (1700-1749), was a Habsburg state administrator, jurist, and ambassador to the Court of St. James's. He married Maria Carolina, Countess of Martinitz in 1722: from this marriage, he had four sons and four daughters.Constant von Wurzbach. Biographisches lexikon des kaiserthums √ñsterreich. Vienna: k. u. k Hof-und staatsdruckerei, 1856-91, vol. 11, pp. 300-301. For the eldest son, Franz de Paula Ulrich, he planned a career in government service, similar to his own, which his son accepted. Franz de Paula Ulrich served for a short time in the Hofrat (High Council) in a juridical position. While in this branch of the state service, on 12 September 1749, he married Maria Sidonie Countess of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (1729-1815); they had four children: Philipp Joseph, Joseph, Wenzel Octavian and Maria Anna. In 1752, his cousin, the F√ºrst Franz Joseph, died childless; his own father had died in 1749, as had his uncle.Wurzbach, p. 301. The allodial seat came to him. After his succession, he gave up state bureaucratic service and joined the Army. He was assigned to the Regiment Colledo in 1754, and in the following year, promoted to Colonel and regimental commander. He led this regiment during the Battle of Lobositz, the first battle of the Seven Years' WarWurzbach, p. 295. and the following year he was promoted to Major General, on 25 June 1757 (effective 26 January 1757). In the second campaign of the war, 1757, he commanded the Infantry Regiment Bolla, in the Austrian victory at the Battle of Kolin. During the battle, he led his regiment to secluded, low ground where they fixed their bayonets and fell upon the Prussian flank; his regiment fought against twice their number, and the Prussians were armed with two cannons. In the battle he was so badly wounded he had to be carried from the field. Reportedly, General Loudon wrote to the Empress that she should put the Order in the regimental flag. He received the Knights Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 7 March 1758. He returned to the field for the Battle of Mansfeld, in September of that year, his horse was killed by a cannonball, and he received a severe contusion. In the third campaign, he participated in the Battle of Hochkirch, in which Leopold Josef Graf Daun masterminded an early morning attack on the Prussian camp. In this battle, he lost two horses when they were shot from under him. He received the Commanders Cross on 15 September 1758, and was promoted to Lieutenant Field Marshal on 19 March 1759.Wurzbach, p. 296. In 1767, he was appointed Feldzeugmeister, of General of Artillery; he also became a member of the Imperial Privy Council on 28 January 1767. He served as Director-General of Artillery, from February 1772 to 1778, when he was promoted to Field Marshal in March of that year. In this capacity, he participated in the War of the Bavarian Succession. In 1761, the Emperor appointed him as Colonel and Proprietor (Inhaber) of the Infantry Regiment N¬∞36, a position he held until his death 18 December 1792. He retired from the military service in 1779, and managed his extensive properties in Vienna, Prague and Moravia. He received the Order of the Golden Fleece on 21 September 1771.

He married Hester Temple, the daughter of Sir Richard Temple, 3rd Baronet by a licence of 25 November 1710. Her brother was Richard Temple, 1st Viscount Cobham whose peerage was entailed upon her and her sons. Political career Grenville was proposed as Whig candidate for Buckinghamshire at the 1715 general election but by an agreement with Richard Hampden he was elected Member of Parliament for Wendover instead. At the 1722 general election he was returned unopposed as MP for Buckingham on the interest of Lord Cobham. Death and legacy Grenville died on 17 February 1727 in the last year of that parliament and his children were taken care of by his brother-in-law Lord Cobham.

Women's Giant Slalom. Alana Jane Nichols (born March 21, 1983) is an American Paralympic wheelchair basketball player and alpine skier. While growing up in Farmington in northern New Mexico, Nichols would spend winters snowboarding in Colorado. During one such snowboarding trip in 2000, she attempted a back flip but over-rotated and landed back-first on a rock. The subsequent injury broke her T10/11 vertebra, and left her paralyzed from the waist down. In 2002, Nichols was introduced to wheelchair basketball and quickly excelled at the sport. She received a scholarship to play with the University of Arizona, where she studied education. After serving as an alternate for the U.S. women's team at the 2004 Summer Paralympics in Athens, was named to the national team in 2005, and helped the team win a silver medal in the 2006 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship. She later attended graduate school at the University of Alabama, eventually graduating with a master's degree in kinesiology. Her Paralympic debut came in 2008 when, as part of the U.S. women's team, she won a gold medal in wheelchair basketball at the Beijing games. One month after the Beijing Paralympics, Nichols moved from Alabama to Colorado to begin training in alpine skiing. She had tried adaptive skiing in 2002, but at the time had chosen to focus on basketball instead. After watching the skiing events at the 2006 Winter Paralympics and learning of the National Sports Center for the Disabled (NSCD) in Winter Park, Colorado, she decided to pursue the sport as soon as the 2008 Summer Paralympics were completed. She began practicing with the NSCD program and showed quick improvement. Her first win came in February 2009 when she beat Paralympic gold medalist Laurie Stephens to take first in the super-G at a North American Cup event in Kimberley, British Columbia. She won the downhill event and placed third in the super combined at the U.S. Adaptive Nationals later that year. In March 2010, she completed her first IPC Alpine World Cup season with a first place in the downhill, second in super combined, and third in super-G. Later in March, she competed in the 2010 Winter Paralympic Games in Vancouver, BC, Canada where she won two gold medals, a silver medal and a bronze medal. She placed first in the downhill and the giant slalom, second in the super-G, and third in the super combined. Nichols is the first American woman with gold medals in the summer and winter games.

He was known as a prominent defender of First Amendment rights. Seigenthaler joined the Nashville newspaper The Tennessean in 1949, resigning in 1960 to act as Robert F. Kennedy's administrative assistant. He rejoined The Tennessean as editor in 1962, publisher in 1973, and chairman in 1982 before retiring as chairman emeritus in 1991. Seigenthaler was also founding editorial director of USA Today from 1982 to 1991. During this period, he served on the board of directors for the American Society of Newspaper Editors, and from 1988 to 1989 was its president. Early life Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Seigenthaler was the eldest of eight siblings. He attended Father Ryan High School and served in the U.S. Air Force from 1946‚Äì49, achieving the rank of sergeant. After leaving the service, Seigenthaler was hired at The Tennessean. While working at The Tennessean, Seigenthaler took courses in sociology and literature at Peabody College, now part of Vanderbilt University. He also attended the American Press Institute for Reporters at Columbia University. Career=Journalism Seigenthaler began his career in journalism as a police beat reporter in The Tennessean city room after his uncle encouraged an editor about his talent. Seigenthaler gradually established himself on the staff among heavy competition that included future standout journalists David Halberstam and Tom Wicker. He first gained prominence in November 1953 when he tracked down the former Thomas C. Buntin and his wife. The case involved the son of a wealthy Nashville business owner who had disappeared in September 1931, followed six weeks later by the disappearance of his secretary. Seigenthaler was sent to Texas by The Tennessean after reports surfaced that Buntin (now known as Thomas D. Palmer) was living somewhere in Texas. While investigating in Orange, Texas, Seigenthaler saw an elderly man step off a bus. Noting the man's distinctive left ear, Seigenthaler followed him home. After three further days of investigation, he went back to the home, where he confirmed the identities of Buntin/Palmer, his wife, the former Betty McCuddy, and their six children. Seigenthaler won a National Headliner Award for the story. Less than a year later, on October 5, 1954, Seigenthaler once again made national news for his efforts in saving a suicidal man from jumping off the Shelby Street Bridge in Nashville. Gene Bradford Williams had called The Tennessean saying he would jump and for the newspaper to \\"send a reporter and photographer if you want a story.\\" After talking to Williams at the bridge for 40 minutes, Seigenthaler watched the man begin to attempt his 100-foot plunge off the bridge railing. Grabbing hold of his collar, Seigenthaler and police saved the man from falling into the Cumberland River. Williams muttered \\"I'll never forgive you\\" to Seigenthaler. On April 29, 2014, the bridge was renamed the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge. In July 1957, Seigenthaler began a battle to eliminate corruption within the local branch of the Teamsters, noting the criminal backgrounds of key employees, along with the use of intimidation in keeping news of certain union activities quiet. During this period, he contacted Dave Beck and Jimmy Hoffa, both top Teamsters officials, but the two men ignored Seigenthaler's queries. His series of articles resulted in the impeachment trial of Chattanooga Criminal Court Judge Ralston Schoolfield. Seigenthaler took a one-year sabbatical from The Tennessean in 1958 to participate in Harvard University's prestigious Nieman Fellowship program. Upon returning to The Tennessean, Seigenthaler became an assistant city editor and special assignment reporter. Politics Frustrated by the leadership of Tennessean publisher Silliman Evans Jr., Seigenthaler resigned in 1960 to serve as an administrative assistant to incoming Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. On April 21, 1961, Seigenthaler was the only other Justice Department figure to witness a meeting between Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. During the Freedom Rides of 1961, Seigenthaler was sent in his capacity as assistant to Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights John Doar reprinted in to be chief negotiator for the government, in its attempts to work with Alabama Governor John Malcolm Patterson. After several days of refusing to return calls, Patterson finally agreed to protect the Riders, but their state trooper escort disappeared as soon as they arrived in Montgomery on May 20, 1961, leaving them unprotected before the waiting white mob. Seigenthaler was a block away when he rushed to help Susan Wilbur, a Freedom Rider who was being chased by the angry mob. Seigenthaler shoved her into his car and shouted \\"Get back! I'm with the Federal government\\" but was hit behind the left ear with a pipe. Knocked unconscious, he was not picked up until police arrived 10 minutes later, with Montgomery Police Commissioner Lester B. Sullivan noting, \\"We have no intention of standing police guard for a bunch of troublemakers coming into our city.\\" Seigenthaler's brief career in government would conclude as a result of Evans' death from a heart attack on July 29, 1961. A brief transition period followed, during which long-time Tennessean reporter John Nye served as publisher. On March 20, 1962, the newspaper made the announcement that Evans' brother, Amon Carter Evans, would be the new publisher. One of the new Evans' first acts would be to bring back Seigenthaler as editor. The two had worked together before at the paper, when Seigenthaler served as assistant city editor and Evans was an aspiring journalist. On one occasion during that era, the two nearly came to blows over Seigenthaler's assignment of Evans to a story. Evans named Seigenthaler editor of The Tennessean on March 21, 1962. With this new team in place, The Tennessean quickly regained its hard-hitting reputation. One example of the paper's resurgence came following a Democratic primary in August 1962, when The Tennessean found documented evidence of voter fraud based on absentee ballots in the city's second ward. Seigenthaler's friendship with Kennedy became one of the focal points of Jimmy Hoffa's bid to shift his jury tampering trial from Nashville. Citing \\"one-sided, defamatory\\" coverage from the newspaper, Hoffa's lawyers were able to get Seigenthaler to admit he personally wanted Hoffa convicted. However, the journalist noted that he hadn't conveyed those sentiments to his reporters. Hoffa's lawyers gained a minor victory when the trial was moved to Chattanooga in a change of venue, but Hoffa was nonetheless convicted in 1964 after a 45-day trial. The following year, Seigenthaler led a fight for access to the Tennessee state senate chamber in Nashville after a resolution was passed revoking the floor privileges of Tennessean reporter Bill Kovach. The action came after Kovach had refused to leave a committee hearing following a call for executive session. In December 1966, Seigenthaler and Richard Goodwin represented the Kennedy family when controversy developed about historian William Manchester's book about the John F. Kennedy assassination, The Death of a President. Seigenthaler had read an early version of the book, which led to Jacqueline Kennedy threatening a lawsuit over inaccurate and private statements in the publication. Seigenthaler then took a temporary leave from his duties at the newspaper to work on Robert Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign. During this period, the journalist was described by the New York Times as, \\"one of a handful of advisers in whom [Kennedy] has absolute confidence.\\" Moments after a victory in the California primary, Kennedy was shot by an assassin and died on June 6, 1968. Seigenthaler would serve as one of the pallbearers at his funeral, and later co-edited the book An Honorable Profession: A Tribute to Robert F. Kennedy. Remaining focused on the cause of civil rights, Seigenthaler then supported Tennessee Bishop Joseph Aloysius Durick in 1969 during the latter's contentious fight to end segregation, a stance that outraged many in the community who still believed in the concept. The New Yorker described Seigenthaler as being \\"well connected in the Democratic Party.\\" He was called a \\"close family friend\\" of the Kennedys, a \\"longtime family friend\\" of the Gores, and a friend of former Democratic Senator James Sasser. In 1976, after having encouraged Al Gore to consider entering public life, he tipped off Gore that a nearby U. S. House representative was retiring. In 1981, Seigenthaler urged Sen. Sasser to return to the Democratic party's \\"liberal tradition\\": \\"I keep telling him that Reagan's going to make it respectable to be a liberal.\\" In 1984, Reagan's reelection team vetoed Seigenthaler as a debate panelist for being too liberal. In publishing On February 8, 1973, Seigenthaler was promoted to publisher of the Tennessean, after Amon Carter Evans was named president of Tennessean Newspaper, Inc. As the publisher, Seigenthaler worked with Al Gore, then a reporter, on investigative stories about Nashville city council corruption in the early 1970s. In February 1976, Seigenthaler contacted Gore at home to tip him off that he had heard that U.S. Representative Joe L. Evins was retiring, telling Gore \\"You know what I think.\\" Seiganthaler previously had been encouraging Gore to consider entering public life. Gore decided to resign from the paper and drop out of Vanderbilt University Law School, beginning his political career by entering the race for Tennessee's 4th congressional district, a seat previously held by Albert Gore Sr., his father. On May 5, 1976, Seigenthaler dismissed Jacque Srouji, a copy editor at The Tennessean, after finding that she had served as an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for much of the previous decade. The controversy came to light after Srouji testified before the Energy and Environment Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, which was investigating nuclear safety. Srouji, who was writing a book critical of Karen Silkwood, had perused more than 1000 pages of FBI documents pertaining to the nuclear power critic. In follow-up testimony, FBI agent Lawrence J. Olson Sr. acknowledged that the bureau had a \\"special relationship\\" with Srouji. Tennessean reporters had been suspicious of Srouji's reporting coups, coming just months after she had joined the paper. These included such things as a late-night FBI raid on illegal gambling establishments, as well as one on a local business suspected of fraud. Afterwards the FBI appears to have collected rumors about Seigenthaler. FBI Deputy Assistant Director Homer Boynton told an editor of the New York Times to \\"look into Seigenthaler,\\" whom he called \\"not entirely pure.\\" After hearing this, Seigenthaler tried for a year to get his own FBI dossier, and finally received some highly expurgated material including these words: \\"Allegations of Seigenthaler having illicit relations with young girls, which information source obtained from an unnamed source.\\" He had previously promised to publish whatever the FBI gave him, and did so. He flatly stated that the charges were false. The attorney general issued an apology, the allegations were removed from Seigenthaler's file, and he received the 1976 Sidney Hillman Prize for \\"courage in publishing\\". In May 1982, Seigenthaler was named the first editorial director of USA Today. In announcing the appointment, Gannett president Allen Neuharth said Seigenthaler was \\"one of the most thoughtful and respected editors in America.\\" During Seigenthaler's tenure at USA Today, he frequently commuted between Nashville and Washington to fulfill his duties at both newspapers. The publication of author Peter Maas' 1983 book, Marie: A True Story, again put Seigenthaler under scrutiny over the investigation of a pardon scandal involving former Tennessee governor Ray Blanton. Marie Ragghianti was the head of the state's Board of Pardons and Paroles before being fired after refusing to release prisoners who had bribed Blanton's aides. Since the Tennessean had supported Blanton, the newspaper's initial reluctance in investigating the charges was called into question. However, editors and reporters had believed that Ragghianti's alleged broken affair with Blanton's chief counsel, T. Edward Sisk, was the motivation for her claims. Later life Seigenthaler discussing media coverage of the Nashville sit-ins at a 2010 panel discussion In 1986, Middle Tennessee State University established the John Seigenthaler Chair of Excellence in First Amendment Studies, honoring Seigenthaler's \\"lifelong commitment to free expression values\\". Seigenthaler announced his retirement in December 1991 from The Tennessean, just months after he made a similar announcement concerning his tenure at USA Today. On December 15, 1991, Seigenthaler founded the First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University, saying, \\"It is my hope that this center at Vanderbilt University ... will help promote appreciation and understanding for those values so vital in a democratic society.\\" The center serves as a forum for dialog about First Amendment issues, including freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion. In 1996, Seigenthaler received the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award as well as an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Colby College. In 2001, Seigenthaler was appointed to the National Commission on Federal Election Reform that followed the 2000 presidential election. He was also a member of the Constitution Project on Liberty and Security. In 2002, when it was discovered that USA Today reporter Jack Kelley had fabricated some of his stories, USA Today turned to Seigenthaler, along with veteran editors Bill Hilliard and Bill Kovach, to monitor the investigation. In 2002, Vanderbilt renamed the 57,000-square-foot (5,300 m¬≤) building that houses the Freedom Forum, First Amendment Center, and Diversity Institute the John Seigenthaler Center. At one point, USA Today and Freedom Forum founder Allen Neuharth called Seigenthaler \\"the best champion of the First Amendment.\\" In April 2014, the Shelby Street Bridge was renamed the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge in his honor. Seigenthaler hosted a book review program on Nashville public television station WNPT, called A Word on Words, and chaired the selection committees for the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation's Profiles in Courage Award and the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial's Robert F. Kennedy Book Award. =Subject of a hoax= On May 26, 2005, an unregistered Wikipedia user created a five-sentence biographical article about Seigenthaler that contained false and defamatory content. The false statement in Seigenthaler's Wikipedia article read: > John Seigenthaler Sr. was the assistant to Attorney General Robert Kennedy > in the early 1960s. For a brief time, he was thought to have been directly > involved in the Kennedy assassinations of both John, and his brother, Bobby. > Nothing was ever proven. When he was alerted of the article's existence, Seigenthaler directly contacted Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales, who removed the false claims. As Seigenthaler later wrote: \\"For four months, Wikipedia depicted me as a suspected assassin before Wales erased it from his website's history\\" on October 5. Seigenthaler noted that the falsehoods that were written about him on Wikipedia were later posted on Answers.com and Reference.com. He later wrote an op-ed on the experience for USA Today in which he wrote, \\"And so we live in a universe of new media with phenomenal opportunities for worldwide communications and researchbut populated by volunteer vandals with poison-pen intellects. Congress has enabled them and protects them\\", a reference to the protection from liability that internet service providers are given under federal law versus editorially controlled media like newspapers and television. Death Seigenthaler died of complications from colon cancer on July 11, 2014, at the age of 86, surrounded by his family in his home.

Artists and scientists have been interested in the effect of LSD on drawing and painting since it first became available for legal use and general consumption. LSD causes visual hallucinations, audiovisual synaesthesia, and experiences of de-realisation. When these effects are mixed with an artist, they often illustrate their hallucinations.  History  A drawing of a face, made under the effects of LSD. Dr. Oscar Janiger noted similarities between paintings made under the influence of the drug and those made by schizophrenics. LSD art dates back to the 1960s, where it became very common as well. The drug became so popular, that some countries started banning the substance in 1967. A French artist by the name of Henri Michaux, was considered ‚Äúa pioneer in psychedelic art‚Äù. Michaux experimented with LSD while creating his now famous book, 'Miserable Miracle', which included both his writings and drawings. Many artists realised how LSD could also positively influence their artwork, which is why it was so popular throughout the 1960s. Dr. Oscar Janiger was one of the pioneers in the field studying the relationship between LSD and creativity. What fascinated Janiger was that \\"paintings, under the influence of LSD, had some of the attributes of what looked like the work done by schizophrenics\\". Janiger maintained that trained artists could \\"maintain a certain balance, riding the edge\\" of the LSD induced psychosis, \\"ride his creative Pegasus\\". Janiger coined the term '\\"dry schizophrenia,\\" where a person was able to control the surroundings and yet be \\"crazy\\" at the same time'. Many artists and their surviving relatives have kept LSD artwork from this period. One patient of Dr. Janiger, bipolar and alcoholic artist Frank Murdoch, was given a controlled, experimental dose of LSD for several months as an attempt to cure his late stage alcoholism. Janiger had Murdoch paint still-lives both on and off LSD, including a Kachina doll (that he reportedly had 70 other patients also paint). Murdoch also continued to paint as an artist while on LSD, including most of his underwater paintings. In the Netherlands, Dr. Stanislav Grof practiced psycholytic therapy in the 1980s, which included having his patients paint on LSD. Some of his artist patients painted numerous paintings while on LSD.

It is the county town of D√∫n Laoghaire‚ÄìRathdown, one of the three authorities that replaced the old Dublin County Council. The town was built following the 1816 legislation that allowed the building of a major port to serve Dublin. It was known as Dunleary until it was renamed Kingstown in honour of King George IV's 1821 visit, and in 1920 was given its present name, the original Irish form of Dunleary. Over time, the town became a residential location, a seaside resort and the terminus of Ireland's first railway. Toponymy L√≥egaire from a stained glass window in the Maritime Museum The town's name means \\"fort of Laoghaire\\". This refers to L√≥egaire mac N√©ill (modern spelling: Laoghaire Mac N√©ill), a 5th century High King of Ireland, who chose the site as a sea base from which to carry out raids on Britain and Gaul. Traces of fortifications from that time have been found on the coast, and some of the stone is kept in the Maritime Museum. The name is officially spelt D√∫n Laoghaire in modern Irish orthography; sometimes unofficially D√∫n Laoire. The old anglicised spelling Dunleary is also seen. This last is how the town's name is commonly pronounced. History D√∫n Laoghaire's origins are generally assumed to trace back to a fort that is believed to have stood there and mostly likely to have belonged to L√≥egaire mac N√©ill. A 1686 map of Dublin Bay by Greenvile Collins gives the name as Dun Lerroy. A later map from 1728 shows a small fishing village at the old harbour, marked as Dunlary or in other later maps as Dunleary. The earlier village was around the area where the Purty Kitchen pub is now (sometimes mapped as \\"Old Dunleary\\"). It had a coffee house and a small cove, both of which are shown on a number of old maps, and it may have had a salt mine (Salthill is close by). At that time, the area was a craggy, rocky pastureland spotted with some granite quarries. Harbour in D√∫n Laoghaire, then known as Kingstown, in about 1895 Around 1800, some maps show a small town centre along what is now Cumberland Street, close to the junction with York Road. On the night of 18‚Äì19 November 1807, two troopships, the Prince of Wales, and the Rochdale, which had departed from Dublin, were driven on the rocks between Blackrock and D√∫n Laoghaire with the loss of over 400 lives. This disaster gave new impetus to an existing campaign for a harbour to be constructed near Dublin. By 1816, the legislation was passed authorising the construction of what is now called the \\"West Pier\\". The lines of the current town centre including George's Street and most adjoining streets are clearly shown on maps prepared for the development of the harbour, and in particular on a John Rennie plan of 1817, when construction of that town centre had barely commenced at the western end of George's Street. That street may originally have been laid out as a military road connecting the D√∫n Laoghaire Martello Towers‚Äîone at the Peoples Park, the other near the end of the West Pier‚Äîboth of which have long disappeared. Whatever its origins, the street was clearly an engineer's design, being ruler-straight for all of its length (except the small western part which clearly pre-dates 1816). When King George IV came to visit the new port under construction in 1821, the name Dunleary was dropped in favour of \\"Kingstown\\"; the town returned to its former name in 1920, in the lead-up to the creation of the Irish Free State. By the time the Ordnance Survey was completed around 1845, the maps show buildings on much of the street and adjacent streets. Ireland's first railway from Dublin to Kingstown, opened in 1834, terminated near the West Pier. It established Kingstown as a preferred suburb of Dublin and led to the construction of residential terraces. By 1844 the Atmospheric Train (designed by Robert Mallet) connected Kingstown to Dalkey, leading to further development. The Atmospheric Train ceased in 1854 but was replaced by the extension of the railway, which was subsequently extended to the ferry port of Rosslare. The opening of the railway from Dublin saw Kingstown become a Victorian era seaside resort. In 1890, the Kingstown Town Commissioners established the People's Park on the site of a depleted quarry. By 1900, the centre of the town was congested and steps were taken to widen the street. These steps included the demolition of shop frontages on George's Street from Patrick Street to Mulgrave Street, and their replacement by new frontages stepped back about 5 yards (4.5m). Shops on the corner of Marine Road and George's Street were also demolished. The main road to Dublin, through Monkstown village and Blackrock, was the sole road connection to the city of Dublin until 1932. In that year, the Eucharistic Congress brought thousands of visitors to Dublin, and plans indicated that most of them would come through D√∫n Laoghaire. The road was considered inadequate, and a new coast road was created by connecting some short segments of road and closing some gardens. This road is now Seapoint Avenue. An agreement with the local residents to restore the area to the pre-Congress condition was never fulfilled. The British 59th (2nd North Midland) Division disembarked at Kingstown in April 1916 and marched up the road to Dublin, to participate in the Easter Rising. Adjacent to the Carlisle Pier and overlooked by the National Maritime Museum of Ireland, there is an anchor, recovered from the wreck of the mailboat which was torpedoed over the Kish Bank in 1918, with the loss of over 500 lives. D√∫n Laoghaire was hit by stray German bombs during the Second World War, with a couple of them landing near the People's Park at Rosmeen Gardens. Damage from the bombs was limited to buildings. Governance and representation D√∫n Laoghaire and port from the air. D√∫n Laoghaire was once the core element of the borough of D√∫n Laoghaire, and until 2013 remained the only town in Ireland to have its own Vocational Education Committee. It is considered part of the Greater Dublin Area. The area is governed locally by D√∫n Laoghaire‚ÄìRathdown County Council which is based at County Hall and is responsible for the provision of local services and amenities. For elections, the town is part of the D√∫n Laoghaire local electoral area which elects six councillors. For elections to D√°il √âireann the town is part of the D√∫n Laoghaire constituency which is currently represented by four TDs; one from Fianna F√°il, one from Fine Gael, one from the Green Party and one from People Before Profit. The former T√°naiste, Eamon Gilmore, who resides in Shankill to the south, was one of the TDs from the constituency between 1989 and 2016. Features The harbour, one of the largest in the country, is notable for its two granite piers. The East Pier is particularly popular with walkers, and was featured in the 1996 film Michael Collins, where Liam Neeson (as Collins) and two of his co-stars are seen walking along a seaside promenade, which is actually the D√∫n Laoghaire East Pier. A band is seen playing on a bandstand in this film scene, and this is the actual bandstand on the East Pier. The bandstand was restored to its original condition in 2010 by the D√∫n Laoghaire Harbour Company. It took 42 years to construct the harbour, from 1817 to 1859. The obelisk near the old ferry port terminal at the harbour commemorates the construction of this harbour. Harbour in D√∫n Laoghaire A lighthouse was at the end of the East Pier, while the new headquarters of the Commissioners of Irish Lights (the General Lighthouse Authority for Ireland) is on Harbour Road. South of the harbour is Scotsman's Bay, where there was a Victorian seaside amusement area, with walks, shelters and baths. The walks and shelters are largely intact. D√∫n Laoghaire Baths have been derelict for many years, but were repainted in bright colours in 2012. Plans for restoration of this area are much debated, and some of the more ambitious ideas have been highly controversial. A traditional Victorian-style park, the People's Park, is at the eastern end of George's Street, and including still-functioning tea rooms. At least one traditional \\"cabman's shelter\\" survives ‚Äì these were small buildings built for the drivers of horse-drawn taxis. Community facilities include the Boylan Community Centre, the D√∫n Laoghaire Scout Den, and a community information service in the tower building of St Michael's Church. A large modern library headquarters was built by the harbour in recent years. D√∫n Laoghaire promenade. Transport Queen Victoria fountain Public transport D√∫n Laoghaire is connected to central Dublin by the DART services, the South Eastern Commuter line and the mainline rail service that runs from Dublin to Rosslare. The town is also served by several bus routes which are the 7, 7a, 45a, 46a, 59, 63, 75 and 111 operated by Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland. The railway station is beside the terminus of the 63, 75 and the 46a, the most frequent and heavily used bus route in Dublin. The 746 bus route from the station terminus to Dublin Airport was discontinued in October 2010. Sandycove and Glasthule and Salthill and Monkstown also serve the area. An Aircoach service links the area with Dublin Airport 24 hours a day with stops at County Hall and the Royal Marine Hotel. Route 703 travels from Killiney to Dublin Airport via Dalkey, Glasthule, D√∫n Laoghaire, Monkstown, Blackrock, Booterstown, Tara Towers hotel, Strand Road and The Point (3Arena). =Rail history= The Dublin and Kingstown Railway, constructed and opened in 1834, was the first-ever railway in Ireland and was built to standard gauge. Extension southward was by the standard gauge Dalkey Atmospheric Railway publicly opened in 1844 which was the first railway to have practical and commercial application of pneumatic power. In the 1850s, the Dublin and Wicklow Railway took over both lines, converting both to Irish gauge and the latter to steam locomotive haulage whilst extending further south to Bray, Wicklow. Successor companies operating the railway were: Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway; Dublin and South Eastern Railway; Great Southern Railways; CI√â; and Iarnr√≥d √âireann. An extension to Carlisle Pier for the boats operated from 1859 until 1980. The railway was subsequently extended to the south to Wexford, Rosslare Harbour and Waterford. Northwards in 1890 the line was extended to Connolly station connecting to other railways. Electrification arrived in 1984, and the electrified suburban service was branded as DART. There are also Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland (since September 2018) services that operate near the station as well as around D√∫n Laoghaire. Ferry From the 19th century, the town was the principal passenger port for ferries between Ireland and Britain, with a frequent service to Holyhead in Anglesey, Wales. Among the ships which operated this route were \\"Banshee\\", \\"Llewellyn\\", \\"Ulster\\", \\"Munster\\", \\"Leinster\\", \\"Connaught\\", \\"MV Cambria\\", \\"MV Hibernia\\", \\"Princess Maud\\", \\"Holyhead Ferry 1\\", \\"St. Columba\\" and \\"Stena Cambria\\".History of Dun Laoghaire Harbour by John de Courcy Ireland At the beginning of the 21st century the route, operated by Stena Line's Stena Explorer ran three times daily in each direction, but competition from low-cost airlines and increasing fuel costs resulted in the service being reduced to once-daily in 2008, and becoming a seasonal (summer-only plus Christmas/New Year) from 2010. From early 2015 Stena Line concentrated their Holyhead routes on Dublin Port, and withdrew the service to D√∫n Laoghaire. Pedestrianisation In the early 2000s, Lower George's Street underwent pedestrianisation, placing a ban on all general traffic with the exception of bus routes toward central Dublin. Bus routes coming along this road into D√∫n Laoghaire were re-routed along the seafront. This restriction was reversed in late 2008. Many of the local residents felt that Dundrum Shopping Centre, which opened a mere 20 minutes drive from D√∫n Laoghaire was the major contributory factor to the \\"downturn\\" and were disappointed that the pedestrianisation was never implemented seriously by the local authorities. D√∫n Laoghaire Business Association attributed the downturn to high parking charges. They unsuccessfully called for these charges to be reduced to one euro per hour (Dundrum charges two euro for three hours). Life boat An inshore and offshore lifeboat operated by the RNLI is based in D√∫n Laoghaire Harbour. The offshore boat is normally moored adjoining the Carlisle Pier. The inshore boat is stored in a stone shed at the base of the East Pier. Until recently lifeboat crews were called to duty using a maroon launched from the shore base. Sports=Boating Harbour entrance from the outer side of East Pier D√∫n Laoghaire harbour is home to a number of yacht clubs including the D√∫n Laoghaire Motor Yacht Club with premises on the West Pier, the Irish National Sailing School & Club based at the foot of the West Pier, the Sailing in Dublin Club with premises in the Coal Harbour, the Royal Irish Yacht Club between the Commissioners for Irish Lights and the marina entrance, the Royal St George Yacht Club opposite the Pavilion Centre, National Yacht Club closest to the East Pier and the Irish Youth Sailing Club which is run by the D√∫n Laoghaire Coast Guard Kyron O'Gorman and located on the East Pier. The area to the north of the West Pier at Salthill Beach sees much windsurfing activity over the twelve months of the year. St Michael's Rowing Club,St Michael's Rowing Club one of the longest- established members of the East Coast Rowing Council, has its roots in D√∫n Laoghaire harbour since the hobblers of the 18th and 19th centuries. The club itself has existed since the early 1920s and still resides in the Coal Harbour boatyard today. Members can regularly be seen rowing their traditional, clinker-built skiffs around the harbour and Scotsman's Bay throughout the year. The Water Wag Club[The Waterwags 1887‚Äì2012 by Alfred and Vincent Delany.] was founded in Kingstown in 1887 to \\"Establish a class of sailing punt with centreboard all rigged and built the same so that an even harbour race can be had with a light rowing and generally useful boat\\". This was the first time in yachting history that all the boats in a race should be identical, and that the winner would be the man with the greatest skill. This concept of 'One-design' has become the norm worldwide and has been adopted for all Olympic sailing events and for most World Championships in sailing. The Water Wag club prospers some 127 years later, and 'Wags' can be seen sailing in D√∫n Laoghaire harbour on Wednesday evenings from late April to mid- September every year. Marina The 820-berth marina is the largest in the country, and opened in 2001 following resistance for over 15 years by a group led by the late John de Courcy Ireland, the maritime historian. A 240-berth extension, involving an investment of ‚Ç¨3 million, was approved in June 2006 by An Bord Plean√°la; the project was completed in April 2007. The marina was the first in Ireland to be awarded a 5 Gold Anchor rating. Golf The town had a golf club from 1909 to 2007, but its members agreed to sell the course to housing developers and move to Ballyman Road, near Enniskerry in County Wicklow. Education Surrounds of D√∫n Laoghaire library The D√∫n Laoghaire area is home to three third-level education establishments; D√∫n Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology (IADT), Dun Laoghaire Further Education Institute (DFEi) formerly called D√∫n Laoghaire College of Further Education (DCFE) on Cumberland Street in Dun Laoghaire town, and Sallynoggin College of Further Education (SCFE). The main primary school in D√∫n Laoghaire is Dominican Primary School D√∫n Laoghaire. Another local primary school is Harold National School, Glasthule founded in 1872. Dun Laoghaire Further Education Institute (DFEi) has been providing education to the Dun Laoghaire area since the 1890s D√∫n Laoghaire has seen several of its secondary schools close in the past two decades, due to population shifts to outlying areas. Four schools which closed are CBS Eblana Avenue, founded in 1856 and closed in 1992 (although the fee-paying school C.B.C. Monkstown which relocated from Eblana continues to this day); the Dominican Convent girls' school, which closed a year earlier in 1991; Dun Laoghaire Community College (previously Dun Laoghaire Tech) which changed to a Further Education Institute in 1996 and to Dun Laoghaire Further Education Institute (DFEi) since then ; and Presentation Brothers, Glasthule founded in 1902, closed in 2007. In Monkstown Farm, Holy Family National School is a primary school; Monkstown Educate Together National School (METNS) is on Kill Avenue, D√∫n Laoghaire. Shopping and business shopping thoroughfare D√∫n Laoghaire has one main shopping street, George's Street, as well as two shopping centres: the D√∫n Laoghaire Shopping Centre and Bloomfields, the former dating from 1977. Recent years have seen some commercial development of the land around the George's Street area, including, notably, the old Pavilion Cinema and Theatre site opposite the County Hall. There is a regular antiques fair held bi-monthly, on Sundays in the Royal Marine Hotel, near the harbour, and a weekly farmers market held in the People's Park on Sundays. There has been plenty of new investment in the area recently, and the D√∫n Laoghaire Shopping Centre will be subject to renovation by its owners Coltard, starting from 2016. The town has a wide range of eating places and public houses, as well as more than one hundred other retail businesses. The town is home to the head office of Ireland's largest supermarket operator, Tesco Ireland, whose stores previously anchored both major shopping centres in the town. But the one in D√∫n Laoghaire Shopping Centre which had been in operation since 1977, closed in May 2011 leaving only the one in Bloomfields. The Tesco store in D√∫n Laoghaire Shopping Centre has subsequently been replaced by SuperValu. D√∫n Laoghaire also holds other company headquarters, such as those of Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Lionbridge Ireland. There is an active Business Association and Chamber of Commerce. In 2018, developer Philip Gannon axed a project to convert the former ferry terminal at D√∫n Laoghaire into a ‚Ç¨20 million digital hub that had been projected to bring in 1,000 jobs and 50 companies. Gannon accused D√∫n Laoghaire Harbour Company of failing to secure the rights to lease the ferry terminal, despite advertising it for lease. Health D√∫n Laoghaire is home to St Michael's Hospital as well as a number of private clinics, therapists and general practitioners. Tourism Much of the town's early growth came from visitors from Dublin, and today there is one large hotel, heavily refurbished in 2007, the Royal Marine, along with several small hotels, and a number of bed-and-breakfasts. Pier Walking Walking the East Pier of D√∫n Laoghaire Harbour is the most popular tourism activity in D√∫n Laoghaire. The west pier is longer but the surface of the pier is less suitable for walking. Cruise ship visits Arcadia Cruise Ship in D√∫n Laoghaire Harbour. The town is visible in the background. In 2011, D√∫n Laoghaire Harbour published a master plan, which focused on developing D√∫n Laoghaire as a tourist destination. Specifically, the plan revolved around promoting D√∫n Laoghaire Harbour as a prime location for both ferries and cruise ships. Since then, many cruise ships have stopped in D√∫n Laoghaire, usually between the months of May and July. The first ship to arrive was the Cunard liner on 16 May, and P&O;'s arrived on 9 July. The Queen Mary 2 was the 7th largest cruise ship in the world at the time, with a maximum passenger capacity of about 3,000. Other large vessels to visit Dun Laoghaire include the QE2 and the aircraft carrier . Dublin Bay Cruises Dublin Bay Cruises sail twice a day from D√∫n Laoghaire to Howth. The scenic trip takes about 75 minutes, and the ferries leave at 11.00am and 3.00pm. Outdoor tourism In July 2013, the first- ever tourism office opened in D√∫n Laoghaire. Kayaking, kite surfing, paddle boarding and sailing are available, along with facilities for biking and rock climbing. Culture National Maritime Museum in the restored Mariners' Church D√∫n Laoghaire has associations with many leading cultural figures, most notably James Joyce and Samuel Beckett. In the second chapter of Ulysses, Joyce refers to Kingstown Pier as a \\"disappointed bridge,\\" and in the opening chapter is based on his stay with Oliver St John Gogarty at a Martello tower located in nearby Sandycove. This tower, known as the James Joyce Tower, now contains a small museum. Samuel Beckett came from nearby Foxrock and is said to have experienced an artistic epiphany, alluded to in his play Krapp's Last Tape, while sitting on the end of one of D√∫n Laoghaire's piers. A bronze plaque marks the spot. The baritone Frederick Ranalow, who performed close to 1,500 performances in The Beggar's Opera, was born in Kingstown, although he moved to England at an early age. The black equestrian and circus owner Pablo Fanque, immortalised in the Beatles' song Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!, performed here for one week during a long engagement in Dublin, in 1850.The Freeman's Journal and Daily Commercial Appeal, 17 June 1850. In August 1991, Seattle grunge band Nirvana played at the Top Hat. D√∫n Laoghaire was previously home to the Festival of World Cultures, a three-day festival dedicated to music from all corners of the globe. It was one of the largest music festivals in Ireland attracting over a quarter of a million visitors to the town over a weekend in August. For nine years (2001‚Äì2010), the festival was a huge success, but D√∫n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council decided to stop hosting the festival after its large losses in 2010. A new purpose-built theatre, the Pavilion Theatre, opened its doors in 2000. Built on the site of the 1903 Kingstown Pavilion, it serves as the municipal theatre for D√∫n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and is a host venue for a number of important festivals, including the International Puppet Festival, and, recently, the Dublin Theatre Festival. St Michael's Church is home to the longest-running series of organ concerts in Ireland, featuring the 1974 organ by Rieger Orgelbau which is the only organ of its type in Ireland. The National Maritime Museum of Ireland is housed in Mariners' Church, which formerly served the Royal Navy. It is directly inland from the East Pier. The building has been completely renovated and reopened. Beside the maritime museum is the DLR Lexicon, the central library and cultural centre of DLR County Council. It opened in 2014, replacing the Carnegie library opened in 1912 on Library Road.D√∫n Laoghaire- Rathdown County Council ‚Äì press release Costing an estimated ‚Ç¨36.6 million, the new building attracted much criticism prior to its opening on account of its size and design. Off Library Road there is the Oratory of the Sacred Heart (4m x 6m), described as a \\"gem of Celtic Renaissance art\\".. It was designed by John J. Robinson, architect of Robinson and Keefe Architects and decorated by Sr. Lynch for members of the former Dominican Convent which existed on the site of the Tesco-anchored \\"Bloomfield\\" Shopping Centre.

History The fortress consisted of a walled enclosure in circuit, the wall being high and thick. In December 1880 Geok Tepe was attacked by 6,000 Russians under General Mikhail Skobelev against 25,000 defenders. The siege of Geok Tepe lasted 23 days, after which the city was taken by storm. Although they encountered heavy resistance, the Russian forces eventually broke in by digging a tunnel under the wall, then detonating a mine underneath the wall. On January 12 (24th new style), 1881, the mine was detonated. Once the fortress was breached, the Russian troops stormed in. Several hundred defenders were killed in the initial explosion, and many more were killed in the fighting that ensued.The legal historian Sir Henry Maine discussed the incident in his last lectures. Eventually, the defenders, along with the 40,000 civilians inside the fortress, fled across the desert, pursued by General Skobelev's cavalry. Around 8,000 Turkmen soldiers and civilians were killed during flight, along with an additional 6,500 that had died inside the fortress. Russian casualties were 398 killed and 669 wounded.

The race car drivers still had to commute to the races using the same stock cars that competed in a typical weekend's race through a policy of homologation (and under their own power). This policy was in effect until roughly 1975. By 1980, NASCAR had completely stopped tracking the year model of all the vehicles and most teams did not take stock cars to the track under their own power anymore. Race report Due to the lack of precision and accuracy of the NASCAR record keepers of the 1950s, only the most vital information of the race was not thrown away after the racing event was over. Only the first two starting positions, all of the finishing positions, and the racing numbers of the most notable drivers were kept. Dave Terrell would score his first of four top-5 finishes at this race. Herb Thomas would lead the race from green flag to checkered flag while this race become the first of four top 5s finishes for Dave Terrell. Harold Mays inflicted terminal vehicle damage on lap 1 while Dick Rathman's vehicle had a busted radiator on lap 20. A tie rod became a major problem for Jimmie Lewallen's vehicle on lap 26 along with Tim Flock's gasket. Curtis Turner's vehicle also had problems with its radiator on lap 35 while an accident took Perk Brown out of the race on lap 39. Frankie Schneider's vehicle would be rendered unworthy to race due to a crash on lap 40. A problem with the vehicle's battery forced Bobby Courtright out of the race on lap 47. Buck Baker would be forced out of the race due to radiator problems on lap 67. Charles Gattalia would overheat his vehicle on lap 69. Braking issues forced Shorty Gibbs out of the race on lap 76 while a missing rear end caused Leonard Tippett to go to the sidelines on lap 108. Joe Eubanks noticed that his vehicle's clutch stopped working on lap 122; forcing him out of the race. Problems with the vehicle's handling took Lee Petty out of the race on lap 142. An over-exhausted battery took Jim Paschal out of the contention on lap 164. The final DNF of the race came when Buddy Shuman noticed that his vehicle's shocks are acting abnormally on lap 175. Two hundred laps were done on a dirt oval track spanning ; making a grand total of . The race took two hours and eight minutes to reach completion and twenty- four drivers competed.

Marshall Teague would run his only race at the North Wilkesboro Speedway; losing his life at a practice session for the 1959 Daytona 500 around seven years later. However, he would only run for 57 laps before withdrawing himself from the race due to reasons unknown. Julian Buesink, Doug Meeks and B.B.

Biography Dallapiccola was born in Pisino d'Istria (current Pazin, Croatia), to Italian parents. Unlike many composers born into highly musical environments, his early musical career was irregular at best. Political disputes over his birthplace of Istria, then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, led to instability and frequent moves. His father was headmaster of an Italian- language school - the only one in the city - which was shut down at the start of World War I. The family, considered politically subversive, was placed in internment at Graz, Austria, where the budding composer did not even have access to a piano, though he did attend performances at the local opera house, which cemented his desire to pursue composition as a career. Once back to his hometown Pisino after the war, he travelled frequently. Dallapiccola took his piano degree at the Florence Conservatory (now known as the Luigi Cherubini Conservatory) in the 1920s. He also studied composition with Vito Frazzi. He became a professor at the conservatory in 1931; until his 1967 retirement he spent his career there teaching lessons in piano as a secondary instrument, replacing his teacher Ernesto Consolo as the older man's illness prevented him from continuing. Dallapiccola's students include Abraham Zalman Walker, Luciano Berio, Bernard Rands, Donald Martino, Halim El-Dabh, Ernesto Rubin de Cervin, Arlene Zallman, Roland Trogan, Noel Da Costa, and Raymond Wilding- White. Dallapiccola's early experiences under the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini, who governed Italy from October 1922 to July 1943, colored his outlook and output for the rest of his life. He once supported Mussolini, believing the propaganda, and it was not until the 1930s that he became passionate about his political views, in protest to the Abyssinian campaign and Italy's involvement in the Spanish Civil War. Mussolini's sympathy with Adolf Hitler's views on race, which threatened Dallapiccola's Jewish wife Laura Luzzatto, only hardened his stance. Canti di prigionia and Il prigioniero are reflections of this impassioned concern; the former was his first true protest work. During World War II he was in the dangerous position of opposing the Nazis; though he tried to go about his career as usual, and did, to a limited extent. On two occasions he was forced to go into hiding for several months. Dallapiccola continued his touring as a recitalist - but only in countries not occupied by the Nazis. Though it was only after the war that his compositions made it into the public eye (with his opera Il prigioniero sparking his fame), it was then that his life became relatively quiet. He made frequent travels to the United States, including appearances at Tanglewood in the summers of 1951 and 1952 and several semesters of teaching courses in composition at Queens College, New York beginning in 1956. He was a sought- after lecturer throughout Western Europe and the Americas. Dallapiccola's 1968 opera Ulisse would be the peak of his career, after which his compositional output was sparse; his later years were largely spent writing essays rather than music. He had no more finished compositions after 1972 due to his failing health, and he died in Florence in 1975 of edema of the lungs. There are, however, a very few sketches and fragments of work from this period, including a vocal work left unfinished just hours before his death. Music It was Richard Wagner's music that inspired Dallapiccola to start composing in earnest, and Claude Debussy's that caused him to stop: hearing Der fliegende Holl√§nder while exiled to Austria convinced the young man that composition was his calling, but after first hearing Debussy in 1921, at age 17, he stopped composing for three years in order to give this important influence time to sink in. The neoclassical works of Ferruccio Busoni would figure prominently in his later work, but his biggest influence would be the ideas of the Second Viennese School, which he encountered in the 1930s, particularly Alban Berg and Anton Webern. Dallapiccola's works of the 1920s (the period of his adherence to fascism) have been withdrawn, with the instruction that they never be performed, though they still exist under controlled access for study. His works widely use the serialism developed and embraced by his idols; he was, in fact, the first Italian to write in the method, and the primary proponent of it in Italy, and he developed serialist techniques to allow for a more lyrical, tonal style. Throughout the 1930s his style developed from a diatonic style with bursts of chromaticism to a consciously serialist outlook. He went from using twelve-tone rows for melodic material to structuring his works entirely serially. With the adoption of serialism he never lost the feel for melodic line that many of the detractors of the Second Viennese School claimed to be absent in modern dodecaphonic music. His disillusionment with Mussolini's regime effected a change in his style: after the Abyssinian campaign he claimed that his writing would no longer ever be light and carefree as it once was. While there are later exceptions, particularly the Piccolo concerto per Muriel Couvreux, this is largely the case. Liriche Greche (1942‚Äì45), for solo voice with instruments, would be his first work composed entirely in this twelve-tone style, composed concurrently with his last original purely diatonic work, the ballet Marsia (1943). The following decade showed a refinement in his technique and the increasing influence of Webern's work. After this, from the 1950s on, the refined, contemplative style he developed would characterize his output, in contrast to the more raw and passionate works of his youth. Most of his works would be songs for solo voice and instrumental accompaniment. His touch with instrumentation is noted for its impressionistic sensuality and soft textures, heavy on sustained notes by woodwinds and strings (particularly middle-range instruments, such as the clarinet and viola). The politically charged Canti di prigionia for chorus and ensemble was the beginning of a loose triptych on the highly personal themes of imprisonment and injustice; the one-act opera Il prigioniero and the cantata Canti di liberazione completed the trilogy. Of these, Il prigioniero (1944‚Äì48) has become Dallapiccola's best-known work. It tells the chilling story of a political prisoner whose jailor, in an apparent gesture of fraternity, allows him to escape from his cell. At the moment of his freedom, however, he finds he has been the victim of a cruel practical joke as he runs straight into the arms of the Grand Inquisitor, who smilingly leads him off to the stake at which he is to be burned alive. The opera's pessimistic outlook reflects Dallapiccola's complete disillusionment with fascism (which he had na√Øvely supported when Mussolini first came to power) and the music contained therein is both beautifully realized and supremely disquieting. His final opera Ulisse, with his own libretto after The Odyssey, was the culmination of his life's work. It was composed over eight years, including and developing themes from his earlier works, and was his last large-scale composition.

She was launched on 4 October 1902 as the last of three s. Along with her sister ships, she participated at the bombardment of Ancona during World War I. At the end of the war, she was given to Great Britain as a war prize. She was scrapped in Italy in 1921.  Construction and layout  Babenberg was the last of three battleships of her class. Her keel was laid down on 19 January 1901 at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste. Following about a year and a half of construction, she was launched on 4 October 1902, when she was named by Countess Marianne von Goess, wife of the Statthalter of Trieste, Count Leopold von Goess. After final fitting-out work was completed, the ship was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian fleet on 15 April 1904. Line-drawing of the Habsburg-class ships; shaded areas show the extent of the armor layout Like all ships of her class, Babenberg was long at the waterline and was in overall length. She had a beam of and a draft of . Freeboard was approximately forward and about aft. The ship also displaced . Once construction was finished, she was commissioned into the Navy with a crew of 638 officers and enlisted men. Babenberg was powered by 2-shaft, 4-cylinder vertical triple expansion engines, which were supplied with steam by 16 Belleville boilers. Babenbergs power output was rated at , which produced a top speed of . The hull for the ship was constructed from longitudinal and transverse steel frames, over which the outer hull plates were riveted into place. The hull incorporated a double bottom that ran for 63% of the ship's length. A series of watertight bulkheads also extended from the keel to the gun deck. All in all, there was a total of 174 watertight compartments in the ship. Babenberg had a metacentric height of between and . Bilge keels were mounted on either side of the hull to reduce rolling and prevent her from capsizing. Babenberg had a flush main deck that was planked with wood, while the upper decks were covered with linoleum or corticine. Babenberg had three L/40 guns, two mounted in a twin turret forward and one mounted in a single turret aft of the main superstructure. The C 97-type guns were manufactured by Krupp in Germany. The main guns fired at a rate of between three and four armor-piercing (AP) shells per minute. Her secondary armament consisted of twelve SK L/40 guns in casemates. These guns could fire at 4‚Äì5 shells per minute. Babenberg was built with face-hardened chrome-nickel steel. The main armored belt was in the central portion of the ship, where the ammunition magazines, machinery spaces, and other critical areas were located. The belt tapered slightly to on either end of the central section.  Service history = Peacetime  When Babenberg was commissioned in 1904, she began participation in fleet drills with her sister ships and . Following a series of simulated wargames against the three battleships, Babenberg and the other two Habsburg-class ships became the I Battleship Division. With the commissioning of the s in 1906 and 1907, the Habsburg-class battleships were transferred from the I to the II Battleship Division, and the three Monarch-class battleships were moved from the II to the III Battleship Division.  World War I  During World War I, Babenberg served with the IV Division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy's battleships and along with her sister ships Habsburg and √Årp√°d and the remainder of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Babenberg was mobilized on the eve of World War I to support the flight of and . The two German ships were stationed in the Mediterranean and were attempting to break out of the strait of Messina, which was surrounded by British troops and vessels and make their way to the Ottoman Empire. After the Germans successfully broke out of Messina, the navy was recalled. The fleet had by that time advanced as far south as Brindisi in southeastern Italy. Babenberg and her sister ships also participated in the Bombardment of Ancona after the Italian declaration of war on the Central Powers. Towards the end of the war, the ship was decommissioned and was retained as a harbor defense ship. Following the end of the war, the ship was awarded to Great Britain as a war prize, but was instead sold and broken up for scrapping in Italy in 1921.

Since 2007, they have released music on Hyperdub, Warp and 2010 Records. History= Early singles  James Young & Aiden Whalley began making music together in London in 2007(?), releasing their first compositions \\"Dead 2 Me\\" & \\"Break\\" under the name Darkstar on their own label - 2010 Records. This release was followed later the same year by \\"Lilyliver/Out of Touch\\" and \\"Memories (Remix)/Sayter\\" a split single with London producer Zomby, issued on the MG77 label. London musician and Hyperdub label head Kode9 released \\"Need You/Squeeze My Lime\\" in 2008. The \\"Round Ours\\" EP was also released in 2008 on Clandestine Cultivations.  Aidy's Girl Is A Computer EP  Over the course of these releases Darkstar steadily developed a unique sound that drew sonically from grime, dubstep, electro and synth-pop - culminating in 2009 with the release of the single \\"Aidy's Girl Is A Computer\\" via Hyperdub. It was named by The Guardian as \\"one of the singles of the year\\" and in the top 100 tracks of 2009 by Pitchfork Media. It was featured on the 5: Five Years of Hyperdub compilation and in Jamie xx's mix for Paris clothing and accessory retailer Colette.  North album  After discarding an album's worth of recordings and enlisting James Buttery as a vocalist, Darkstar recorded a full-length album that largely eschewed dance music in favor of a unique blend of melancholy electronic pop and ambient experimentation. The album, North, was released by Hyperdub on 18 October 2010. Despite being a marked departure from their earlier 12\\" releases it was met with wide acclaim. FACT called it \\"an incredibly fragile, engaging and emotionally driven record. North is an impressive debut and one of the most unique albums you‚Äôre likely to hear in 2010\\" and the BBC declared it \\"a downbeat record that reclaims dubstep's original dark energy and experimental imperative\\".  News From Nowhere album  After considerable international touring on the back of North, Whalley, Young and Buttery decamped to a house in rural Yorkshire to begin writing and recording their next album, to be released on Warp. Buttery was now involved in the writing and recording process as an official member of Darkstar. Whalley said in an interview with online magazine Dummy in August 2012 \\"This album‚Äôs more different though because we‚Äôve kind of exhausted that idea, and those melodies that were on ‚ÄòNorth‚Äô and the ones before, as soon as we came up with ideas that reminded us of that we had to move away from it and come up with something that was a new challenge. Get away from the old melodies and the melancholy sentiment.\\" Darkstar recorded News From Nowhere with producer Richard Formby in Leeds, giving them access to Formby's vintage analogue synthesizers and classic tape machines. The album is named after William Morris' classic book whose subject matter combined utopian socialism and science fiction. Released in February 2013, News From Nowhere was called \\"elegant and progressive\\" by MOJO and The Quietus described it \\"like being pushed off a skyscraper and discovering wings‚Ä¶altogether beyond words\\". The sound of their new material garnered Darkstar favorable comparisons to Radiohead, James Blake, Massive Attack, Animal Collective and Brian Eno. Influential London record shop Rough Trade named News From Nowhere its \\"Album of The Month\\" for February 2013.  \\"01484\\" & \\"HD7\\" EPs  \\"01484\\" and \\"HD7\\" are two remix EPs, reworking tracks from the band's February 2013 album \\"News from Nowhere\\". The titles of the EPs are named after the Huddersfield and surrounding areas dialling code and post code, and the band chose to name them so as the remixes are an extension of the album which was recorded in Slaithwaite, West Yorkshire. \\"01484\\" calls on German house and techno producer Motor City Drum Ensemble to rework \\"A Day's Pay For A Day's Work\\" alongside the band remixing their own tracks, \\"Young Hearts\\" and \\"Armonica\\". The second EP \\"HD7\\" features a remix from Kollaps, a producer on Zomby's Cult Music label, alongside further remixes from the band. \\"01484\\" was released in October 2013 via Warp and \\"HD7\\" via the same imprint later in 2013. Kirklees Arcadia mixtape On 9 April Darkstar released their mixtape ‚ÄòKirklees Arcadia‚Äô. For the Mixtape, Aidan and James collaborate with Gwilym Gold, Zomby and Wild Beasts singer Hayden Thorpe who fills in vocals on a cover of Paul McCartney‚Äôs Temporary Secretary. The mixtape also features a re- edit of the group‚Äôs Aidy‚Äôs Girl Is A Computer and a remix of LFO‚Äôs We Are Back. Foam Island album Third studio album \\"Foam Island\\" was released on 25 September (UK) and 2 October (ROW) via Warp Records. The duo shared lead track 'Pin Secure' on album announce. The album's themes were inspired by social change in the UK and in particular how this is affecting the youth of today post UK Conservative Party re-election. The duo travelled to Huddersfield in order to talk to and capture the thoughts and aspirations of the Northern youth of England.

Hans Christian Hagedorn (1888-1971) Hans Christian Hagedorn (6 March 1888 ‚Äì 6 October 1971) was the creator of NPH insulin and the founder of Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium, which is known today as Novo Nordisk. Biography Hagedorn and August Krogh (1874‚Äì1949) obtained the rights for insulin from Banting and Best in Toronto. In 1923 they formed Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium, and in 1926 with August Krogh he obtained a Danish Royal Charter as a non- profit foundation. In the 1930s he became interested in modifying the absorption rate of insulin. He was aware that contaminating proteins slowed the absorption of insulin into the bloodstream, but these caused irritation and side effects. Thus he searched for a protein that would not cause any irritation. He came upon protamine, a protein isolated from fish sperm. Hagedorn discovered that the addition of protamine to insulin caused the insulin to form microscopic clumps. These clumps took longer to dissolve into the bloodstream. This complex of protamine and insulin is known as NPH (neutral protamine Hagedorn) insulin. It is one of the earliest example of engineering drug delivery.

Osemozotan has antidepressant, anxiolytic, antiobsessional, serenic, and analgesic effects in animal studies,Abe, Michikazu, Hiroshi Nakai, Reiko Tabata, Ken-Ichi Saito, and Mitsuo Egawa. \\"Effect of 5-{3-[((2S)-1,4-Benzodioxan-2-ylmethyl)amino]propoxy}-1,3-benzodioxole HCL (MKC-242), a Novel 5-HT1A-Receptor Agonist, on Aggressive Behavior and Marble Burying Behavior in Mice.\\" Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 76 (1998): 297-304. and is used to investigate the role of 5-HT1A receptors in modulating the release of dopamine and serotonin in the brain, and their involvement in addiction to abused stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine. Pharmacodynamics The target of Osemozotan is 5-HT1A receptors. This molecules bind with almost 1000 times greater affinity to 5-HT1A receptors than most other 5-HT, dopamine, or adrenergic receptors. With repeated exposure of Osemozotan at the 5-HT1A receptors, there seems to be no change in the number of receptors, which is not typically seen with pharmaceutical agonists. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic data was collected from animal studies performed in mice and rats. The CMax was obtained 15 minutes after oral ingestion of Osemozotan, the area under the curve was 2,943 ng x hr/mL and the half-life was 1.3 hours. The pharmacokinetic testing has been able to help explain the longer acting pharmacologic effects of Osemozotan, and the increased potency. Osemozotan was shown to have increased duration of pharmacologic effects compared to azapirones and requires a substantially lower dose to produce its pharmacologic effects. This may be attractive to populations that will have to take this medication in that they may not have to take the medication as often throughout the day. In these studies there was a difference in dosage amount necessary for the indication it is used. Osemozotan has not been found to be metabolized to 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine, a common metabolite found with the azapirone class of medications. 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine has affinity for receptors other than 5-HT1A, decreasing its specificity and increasing the risk of unwanted effects. Since Osemozotan does not express this metabolite, it has greater specificity to 5-HT1A compared to other anxiolytic medications. Uses As mentioned above, Osemozotan is being investigated in its usage to treat pain, aggressive behavior, anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and drug dependence with methamphetamine and cocaine. Pain It has been proposed that Osemozotan be used as an analgesic agent because of its activation of 5-HT 1A receptors that lead to inhibitory serotonin signaling pathway within the spinal cord to cause hypoalgesia and decrease mechanical allodynia. Aggressive behavior Osemozotan was found to decrease the number of fighting incidences in mice similar to buspirone, diazepam, and tandospirone but required a lower pharmacologic dose to produce beneficial effects. Osemozotan showed dose-dependent anti-aggressive effects and was not shown to decrease motor coordination within the mice. Anxiety and depression 5-HT 1A receptors when stimulated have shown to have anxiolytic and antidepressant pharmacologic effects. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Obsessive-Compulsive patients have been found to have increased 5-HT levels within the brain. With the use of Osemozotan as a 5-HT 1A agonist, there will be a decrease in serotonergic activity within the brain, leading to possible anti-obsessional pharmacological action. One animal mouse model used to test for OCD is known as the marble burying test in which the amount of marbles buried within a certain time frame is recorded. Mice performed the marble burying test both with and without Osemozotan. With Osemozotan administration, the number of marbles buried was decreased with apparently little to no loss in motor coordination; these test results support the theory that Osemozotan may be useful in the treatment of OCD. Drug dependence It has been noted that sensitization of cocaine may stem from action of the 5-HT 1A receptor. While the role of 5-HT receptors with methamphetamine is still not certain, the use of osemozotan was found to decrease 5-HT levels in patients with repeated methamphetamine exposure; this may be a possibility for treatment of drug dependence with cocaine and methamphetamine. Prevalence of mental disease states About 18% of American adults suffer from some type of anxiety disorder and 1 in 5 adults in the United States are on some type of medication to help control or improve their behavior. The prevalence of prescription medication use for mental illnesses has noticeably increased in the past few years, with increasing numbers in the younger adults and in men. Around 60 billion dollars are spent annually for treatments dealing with mental illnesses.

The Gramvousa islands are administered by the municipality of Kissamos. Naming Imeri Gramvousa (), which translates to Tame Gramvousa, hosts the remains of a Venetian fort and the remains of buildings left behind by Cretan insurgents, who were compelled to live as pirates during the Greek War of Independence. Today, Imeri Gramvousa is a popular tourist attraction. Agria Gramvousa (), which translates to Wild Gramvousa, is much less hospitable and is located due north of Imeri Gramvousa. It has also been named False Gramvousa. page 141 In ancient times the larger island was known as Korykos, page 133 which means leather bag. pages 139-140 The island was name \\"Gramvousa\\" in honour of Vousa, the wife of a pirate chief and the only inhabitant of the island to evade capture when the pirates were forcibly removed. Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian Wars Basilicata The walls of the fort at Imeri Gramvousa The fort at Imeri Gramvousa was built between 1579 and 1584 during Venetian rule over Crete to defend the island from the Ottoman Turks. The fort remained in Venetian hands throughout the prolonged Cretan War, and in the treaty of 16 September 1669, which surrendered Crete to the Ottomans, Gramvousa, along with the fortresses of Souda and Spinalonga, was retained by Venice.Maltezou, Crete under Venetian rule, p. 159 These three forts defended Venetian trade routes and were also strategic bases in the event of a new Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian war for Crete.Detorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 343 On 6 December 1691, during the Morean War (another Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian war), the Neapolitan Captain de la Giocca betrayed the Venetians by surrendering Gramvousa to the Ottoman Turks for a generous bribe. He lived the rest of his life in Constantinople and was well known by the nickname \\"Captain Grambousas\\". Not long after the start of Turkish rule, Cretan insurgents used to gather at the three coastal forts which included Gramvousa.Detorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 355 Greek War of Independence With the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, the fort fell to the insurgents' hands. In 1823, Emmanouil Tombazis, the Greek provisional government's commissioner for Crete, failed to strengthen the defences at Gramvousa when he had the opportunity, soon after his arrival on the island.Detorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 378 Towards the summer of 1825, a body of three to four hundred Cretans, who had fought with other Greeks in the Peloponnese, journeyed to Crete. On 9 August 1825, led by Dimitrios Kallergis and Emmanouil Antoniadis, this group of Cretans, disguised as Turks, captured the fort at Gramvousa, which became their base. These and subsequent actions revitalized the Cretan insurgency, ushering the so-called \\"Gramvousa period\\".Detorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 381 Although the Ottomans did not manage to retake the fort, they were successful in blocking the spread of the insurgency to the islands' western provinces. The insurgents were besieged in Gramvousa for more than two years and they had to resort to piracy to survive. Gramvousa became a hive of piratical activity that greatly affected Turkish-Egyptian and European shipping in the region. During that period the population of Gramvousa became organised and they built a schoolDetorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 422 and a church. The church was called Panagia i Kleftrina and was dedicated to the wives of the klephts, namely the pirates.Detorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 383 In 1828, the new Governor of Greece, Ioannis Kapodistrias, sent Alexander Mavrocordatos with British and French ships to Crete to deal with the pirates. This expedition resulted in the destruction of all pirate ships at Gramvousa and the fort came under British control. On 5 January 1828, on Kapodistrias' orders Hatzimichalis Dalianis landed at Gramvousa with 700 men. During the Cretan revolt of 1878, only the forts at Gramvousa, Ierapetra, Spinalonga, Heraklion, Rethymnon, Izeddin, Hania, and Kissamos could not be captured by the insurgents because they did not have the necessary artillery.Detorakis, Turkish rule in Crete, p. 408 Balos Lagoon There is a lagoon, named the Balos lagoon, between the island and the coast of Crete.

The doctrine is based on economics within environmentalism. Typically, by providing more upfront capital, one can create a system that is less energy intensive, less wasteful, and generally less expensive to maintain in the long run. By redeveloping sustainably, long term energy efficiencies can be realized, coupled with highly reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Within the ideals of nation-building, sustainable redevelopment can take up a greater significance. Post-disaster countries are in a unique situation to deal with these systems of ideals. Within this context, the idea behind initiating post- trauma sustainable redevelopment is that the underlying infrastructure is destroyed or damaged, therefore the situation is ideal for realizing the opportunities inherent to the situation. Background Sustainable development and redevelopment are closely linked, and several organizations have been implicitly involved with sustainable development. This type of development, in contrast to redevelopment, is not different other than the application to a specified problem. Sustainable development, is a form of development that coexists with existing forms of development. While the systems for recreation on a small/local level are not universally widespread, there are several institutions which engage in sustainable development, that can theoretically be carried over to redevelopment. The Kyoto Protocol's 12th Article speaks to \\"flexible mechanisms\\". These mechanisms allow countries which have ratified the Kyoto Protocol to lower their overall emissions through the most economical means, respective, of course, to that country. Theoretically, these mechanisms could be directed towards post-traumatic redevelopment. UN The United Nations Division for Sustainable Development \\"provides leadership and is an authoritative source of expertise within the United Nations system on sustainable development\\". The Division for Sustainable Development has been essential in the creation of such policies as Agenda 21, and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation. The United Nations declares that \\"Sustainable reconstruction management provides numerous environmental, safety and financial benefits.\\" World Bank The World Bank has been working on sustainable development projects through one of their internal groups, the Sustainable Development Network. These two groups work together to provide key sectors for sustainable development: \\"agriculture and rural development, energy, transport, water, environment, urban development, social development, oil, gas, mining, and chemicals, information and communication technologies, and sub-national activities\\".

British naval Captain Edward Pellew in captured her off the √éle de R√© on 7 August 1798. The Admiralty took her into the Royal Navy as the post ship HMS Danae. Some of her crew mutinied in 1800 and succeeded in turning her over to the French. The French returned her to her original name of Vaillante, and sold her in 1801. As a government-chartered transport she made one voyage to Haiti; her subsequent history is unknown at this time. French service Vaillante was built at Bayonne between 1794 and August 1796, and was launched in 1796. She was armed with twenty long 8-pounders and 175 men, commanded by Lieutenant la Porte, and bound to Cayenne, carrying 25 banished priests, 27 convicts, and Madame Rov√®re and family.James (1837), Vol. 2, p.229. Indefatigable captured Vaillante off the √éle de R√© on 7 August 1798. She arrived in Portsmouth on 20 October 1798, was registered and renamed Danae on 11 October 1798 and was fitted out until February 1799. James draws attention to the fact that the British equipped her with more cannons, but fewer men, than the French had. British service Captain Lord William Proby commissioned Danae in December 1798. In March 1799 a gale caught her in a bay of shoals and rocks near the √éle de Batz. Two of her anchor cables broke and her crew let go a third anchor, which held. The storm stove in all her boats and Proby slipped and fell down the main hatchway. The fall dislocated his shoulder and broke two ribs.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 1, p.349. On 4 April 1799 Danae captured the 14-gun lugger Sans Quartier, off Chausey. Sans Quartier had a crew of 56 men and though she was pierced for 14 guns, she had thrown all overboard in an attempt to escape from Danae. On 25 December 1799 Danae, and the hired armed cutter Nimrod assisted , which had hit some rocks. They were able to rescue the crew and Ethalion was then burnt.Duncan et al., (1806), Vol. 3. pp.211-2. The next year, on 10 January 1800, Danae was in company with and when Excellent recaptured the American vessel Franklin, which a French privateer Alliance had taken the day before. Franklin had been sailing from St. Thomas for London with a cargo of sugar, coffee and indigo. The privateers had done a great deal of damage to the vessel and her cargo before the British recaptured her.United States Congress, United States congressional serial set, Issue 6325, p.131-2. On 6 February 1800, Danae, with other vessels, captured the 42-gun frigate Pallas from Saint-Malo bound to Brest, off St Malo. The British took Pallas into service as .James (1837), Vol. 2, pp.29-32. That morning Danae also captured a French cutter. One month later, on 6 March, Danae sailed from Plymouth on a cruise to the westward. Then on 10 March Danae recaptured the sloop Plenty. A French privateer had captured Plenty, Needs, master, as she sailed from Cork to Lisbon. Danae sent Plenty into Plymouth.Lloyd's List, ‚Ññ4033. Mutiny At 9:30 in the evening of 14 March 1800 mutineers took control of Danaes deck while the officers were mostly below decks asleep. The captain of the foretop, William Jackson, attacked and threw the master, who was officer of the watch, down the main hatchway. The mutineers succeeded in securing the hatchways, preventing Proby, his officers, and the loyal seamen from coming up on deck.James (1837) Vol. 3, pp.34-5. Proby and his officers tried to regain the deck but the mutineers drove them back and inflicted a head wound on Proby. The following morning the mutineers reached Le Conquet in Finist√®re, where they met up with the French brig Colombe, which Danae had herself chased into the port. A detachment of soldiers came aboard and accepted Lord Proby's surrender. Danae and Colombe then sailed together to Brest. On the way the frigates and chased them briefly before breaking off after the mutineers falsely signaled that they were in pursuit of Colombe. The French treated Captain Proby, his officers and the loyal seamen well, and then paroled them. A court martial aboard on 17 June 1800 honourably acquitted Proby, his officers and the loyal members of the crew of blame. Fate The French restored Danae to her original name. They sold Vaillante to a Morlaix merchant named Cooper in 1801. Cooper then chartered her back to the French government as a transport. She made a single voyage to Haiti during the Haitian Revolution of Toussaint Louverture. It is not known what happened to the ship after 1802. Post script On 30 May 1800 left Plymouth on a cruise. She returned that same evening and landed two seamen, mutineers from Danae that Dasher had taken out of a cartel off the Sound.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p.510. On 12 June Indefatigable captured the French privateer Vengeur, which had sailed from Bordeaux two days previously for Brazil. When her crew landed at Plymouth the authorities conveyed them to Mill prison. There, on 24 August, Lieutenant Neville Lake, who had been first lieutenant in Danae, identified John Barnet(t) as one of the mutiny's ringleaders. The court martial on 2 September sentenced Barnet to death; he was hanged from the fore-yard arm of Pique on 9 September.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.242.The identification of Lieutenant Lake as first lieutenant of Danae is inconsistent with the identification of Lieutenant Nevin as first lieutenant of Danae in a subsequent court martial of another mutineer. At the end of September the Guernsey privateers Alarm, Dispatch, and Marquis of Townsend recaptured a large West Indiaman that the French privateer Grand Mouche had captured and sent to Brest. The Guernseymen's prizemaster discovered that the French prize crew included seven mutineers from Danae.Naval chronicle, Vol. 4, p.340. Another mutineer, John M'Donald, alias Samuel Higgins, was seized in the streets of Wapping disguised as an American carrying American protection papers. His court martial took place aboard , at the Nore on 10 June 1801. Lieutenant Nevins, who had been Danaes first lieutenant and who had apprehended M'Donald in London, testified that while he was in a tavern with M'Donald after apprehending him, M'Donald had said that the instigators of the plot to take Danae were two men named Jackson and Williams and an Irish priest (and former officer of the Irish rebel army) named Ignatius Finney.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5 (Jan-Jul 1801), p.537. M'Donald was hanged on 20 June on , a guardship at the Nore. John Williams was tried in September, but was pardoned by King George III due to a technicality. It is not clear what, if anything, happened to William Jackson or Ignatius Finney.

In order for a LCLC to be subclassified as the rhabdoid phenotype variant, at least 10% of the malignant tumor cells must contain distinctive structures composed of tangled intermediate filaments that displace the cell nucleus outward toward the cell membrane. The whorled eosinophilic inclusions in LCLC-RP cells give it a microscopic resemblance to malignant cells found in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a rare neoplasm arising from transformed skeletal muscle. Despite their microscopic similarities, LCLC-RP is not associated with rhabdomyosarcoma. Although rhabdoid variants of LCLC are sometimes referred to as \\"rhabdoid carcinomas\\", this particular term should be reserved for examples of \\"pure\\" rhabdoid neoplasms (i.e. those that do not contain cells containing other histological variants) Classification Lung cancers are now considered a large and extremely heterogeneous family of neoplasms that feature widely varying genetic, biological, and clinical characteristics. About 50 different lung cancer variants are recognized under the 2004 revision of the World Health Organization (\\"WHO-2004\\") histological typing system, the most widely recognized and used lung cancer classification scheme. Recent studies have shown beyond doubt that the old classification paradigm of \\"small cell carcinoma vs. non-small cell carcinoma\\" is now obsolete, and that the correct \\"subclassification\\" of lung cancer cases is necessary to assure that patients receive optimum management. More than 99% of primary lung cancers are carcinoma, which are tumors composed of cells that originate from embryonic ectoderm or endoderm, or that feature epithelial characteristics or differentiation. Eight major groups of lung carcinomas are recognized in WHO-2004: ::*Squamous cell lung carcinoma ::*Small cell lung carcinoma ::*Adenocarcinoma of the lung ::*Large cell lung carcinoma ::*Adenosquamous carcinoma ::*Sarcomatoid carcinoma ::*Carcinoid tumor ::*Salivary gland-like carcinoma of the lung LCLC-RP are considered variants of large cell carcinoma. Histogenesis  The histogenesis of most lung cancers is not well understood. Carcinomas of the lung are thought to arise from the uncontrolled growth of mutated, transformed, multipotent \\"cancer stem cells\\" with epithelial characteristics or lineage. When viewed under a light microscope, the transformed cancer cells in LCLC are undifferentiated, lacking specific cytological and tissue architectural characteristics of other types, subtypes, and variants of lung cancer. Election microscopic studies, however, have shown that many LCLC do have ultrastructural characteristics of other tumor types (i.e. adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma)., and that rhabdoid carcinomas often show similar features. Some evidence suggests that cells with the rhabdoid phenotype result from mutations occurring in some of the cells descending from the \\"parent\\" tumor, leading to the \\"emergence\\" of distinct populations of characteristic cells with the rhabdoid phenotype within the parent neoplasm, often in the peripheral part of the tumor. Missense mutations occurring in the cytokeratin 8 (CK-8) gene (RTK 8) at specific codons affects the way the protein products of this gene assume their normal two- and three- dimensional shapes, and may well affect the way the mutant proteins undergo assembly into filamentous structures within the cytoplasm. The defective \\"protofilament\\" products apparently accumulate aberrantly, and thus form the distinctive whorled paranuclear inclusions that are characteristic of the rhabdoid cell. It seems likely that mutations and post-translational modifications affecting cytokeratin 8, cytokeratin 18, and vimentin protofilaments are intimately involved in the genesis of the characteristic inclusions and, therefore, of the rhabdoid phenotype. The particulars of this process are poorly understood, but depend in part on the origin of the tumor and stochastic genomic phenomena. Rhabdoid cells often express protein products suggestive of aggressive, dedifferentiated cells, including neuroendocrine tumor-related products and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Vimentin, an intermediate filament protein usually associated with non-carcinomatous tumors (i.e. sarcoma), is ubiquitous in rhabdoid cells. Co-expression of cytokeratins and vimentin are associated with cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). While undifferentiated large-cell lung carcinoma is the most common parent lung tumor from which a rhabdoid phenotype evolves, malignant cells with a rhabdoid phenotype are known to occur in many different histological variants of lung cancer, including adenocarcinoma, sarcomatoid carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, combined large cell neuroencrine carcinoma, and mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and combined small cell lung carcinoma. Metastasis LCLC-RP is generally considered to be an especially aggressive malignancy that metastasizes widely early on in its clinical course. Similar to most other forms of lung carcinoma, LCLC-RP may spread (\\"metastasize\\") in three major ways ‚Äî by local extension and infiltration into surrounding tissues, by lymphatic spread to regional lymph nodes, and through the bloodstream (hematogeneous metastasis) to distant organs and tissues such as the liver, brain, and skeleton. It has been reported recently that LCLC-RP can metastasize locally within the airways (\\"aerogeneous spread\\"), an uncommon mechanism of extension wherein tumor cells migrate along the lung walls and septa, but do not destroy air sacs. Previously, this type of metastatic behavior had not been seen in this particular tumor, being traditionally associated almost exclusively with the \\"pneumonic\\" form of pulmonary bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. Diagnosis While occasional scattered rhabdoid cell formation occurs with considerable frequency in lung carcinomas, this is not considered to be of clinical significance. According to current classification criteria, a tumor can only be diagnosed as LCLC-RP when an undifferentiated large-cell lung carcinoma contains a rhabdoid cell component that makes up at least 10% of the tumor mass. Microscopic characteristics of rhabdoid cells include: *Oval to polygonal cell shape *Eosinophilic, hyaline- like perinuclear agglomerations of intermediate filaments *Compressed, eccentric nuclei *Prominent central macronucleoli (one or two) *Abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm *Reticular chromatin pattern Differential Diagnosis The differential diagnosis of LCLC-RP includes secondary metastatic lesions, malignant melanoma of the lung with rhabdoid phenotype, mucinous adenocarcinomas (particularly those featuring signet-ring cells), rhabdomyosarcoma, epitheloid angiosarcoma, pleural mesothelioma, and plasmacytoma. Imaging On radiological imaging, most cases of LCLC-RP are single \\"coin lesions\\" or discrete masses, but cases presenting as multiple nodules throughout the lung have also been noted. Cases with inhomogeneous- appearing consolidation on CT have been reported, as well as aerogenous, lepidic-type spread. Some large, centrally located LCLC-RP have been noted to show signs of gross necrosis and cavitation on imaging studies, as well as being associated with the presence of large bullae. Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry is an important factor in diagnosis.Results of immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in rhabdoid lung cancers tends to reflect the multiphasic nature of these tumors. Typically, markers expressed in LCLC- RP include those seen in \\"generic\\" NSCLC's, such as epithelial membrane antigen (EMA, 61%), various cytokeratins (CK's, 80%), and markers associated with the underlying \\"parent\\" pulmonary carcinoma. Expression of immunomarkers in the rhabdoid cells, however, have often been noted to be weaker and more diffuse than those in the more differentiated tumor cells. They also more frequently express \\"non-carcinomatous\\" markers typically associated with \\"dedifferentiated\\" neoplasms. Expression of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), a commonly used marker for primary lung cancers, appears to be less frequent in rhabdoid carcinomas than in most other histotypes of pulmonary cancers. Vimentin, an intermediate filament protein usually found in sarcoma, is ubiquitously (nearly 100%) expressed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm of the rhabdoid cells, and is often intermingled with CK's in their whorled inclusions. Some studied have reported that neuroendocrine-related markers (i.e. neuron-specific enolase (NSE), neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), chromogranin A (CgA), synaptophysin), are also quite frequently expressed in a significant proportion of rhabdoid cells. Treatment Because LCLC-RP is so rare, no clinical trials have ever been conducted that specifically address treatment of this lung cancer variant. Because LCLC-RP is considered a form of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), most physicians adhere to published NSCLC treatment guidelines in rhabdoid carcinoma cases. When possible, radical surgical resection with curative intent is the primary treatment of choice in early stage NSCLC's, and can be administered with or without adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or palliative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, depending on the disease stage and performance status of the individual patient. In numerous clinical trials conducted in NSCLC, several different platinum-based chemotherapy regimens have been shown to be more-or-less equally effective. LCLC's, as a subtype of NSCLC, have traditionally been included in many of these clinical trials, and have been treated like other NSCLC's. More recent trials, however, have shown that some newer agents may have particular effectiveness in prolonging survival of LCLC patients. Pemetrexed, in particular, has shown significant reduction in the hazard ratio for death when used in patients with LCLC. Taxane-based (paclitaxel, docetaxel) chemotherapy was shown to induce a complete and sustained response in a liver metastasis in a case of LCC-RP. A later-appearing metastasis within mediastinal lymph nodes in the same case also showed a durable response to a taxane alone. There have also been reports of rhabdoid carcinomas expressing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), suggesting that targeted molecular therapy with VEGF blocking monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab may be active in these variants. However, evidence suggests that caution must be used when treating a cavitated rhabdoid tumor, one that contains significant components of squamous cell differentiation, or large tumors with containing major blood vessels, due to the potential high risk of life-threatening pulmonary hemorrhage. A recent study reported a case wherein 2 courses of adjuvant therapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel, followed by oral gefitinib, were used after complete resection. The patient had had no recurrence 34 months later. As large-volume LCLC-RP may show significant central necrosis and cavitation, prudence dictates that oncologists use extreme caution if contemplating the therapeutic use of bevacizumab, other anti-VEGF compounds, or anti-angiogenesis agents in general, which have been associated with a greatly increased risk of severe hemorrhage and hemoptysis that may be quickly fatal in cavatated pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas. Similar elevated risks have also been noted in tumors located near, or containing, large blood vessels., Prognosis LCLC- RP are considered to be especially aggressive tumors with a dismal prognosis. Many published cases have shown short survival times after diagnosis. Some studies suggest that, as the proportion of rhabdoid cells in the tumor increases, the prognosis tends to worsen, although this is most pronounced when the proportion of rhabdoid cells exceeds 5%. With regard to \\"parent\\" neoplasms other than LCLC, adenocarcinomas with rhabdoid features have been reported to have worse prognoses than adenocarcinomas without rhabdoid features, although an \\"adenocarcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype\\" tumor variant has not been specifically recognized as a distinct entity under the WHO-2004 classification system. There are case reports of rhabdoid carcinomas recurring after unusually long periods, which is unusual for a fast-growing, aggressive tumor type. One report described a very early stage patient whose tumor recurred 6 years after initial treatment. Although rapidly progressive, fulminant courses seem to be the rule in this entity, long-term survival has also been noted, even post-metastectomy in late stage, distant metastatic disease. Epidemiology Although reliable and comprehensive incidence statistics are nonexistent, LCLC-RP is a rare tumor, with only a few hundred cases described in the scientific literature to date. LCLC's made up about 10% of lung cancers in most historical series, equating to approximately 22,000 cases per year in the U.S. Of these LCLC cases, it is estimated that about 1% will eventually develop the rhabdoid phenotype during tumor evolution and progression. In one large series of 902 surgically resected lung cancers, only 3 cases (0.3%) were diagnosed as LCLC-RP. In another highly selected series of large-cell lung carcinoma cases, only 4 of 45 tumors (9%) were diagnosed as the rhabdoid phenotype using the 10% criterion, but another 10 (22%) had at least some rhabdoid cell formation. It appears likely, therefore, that LCLC-RP probably comprises between 0.1% and 1.0% of all lung malignancies. Similar to nearly all variants of lung carcinoma, large cell lung carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype appears to be highly related to tobacco smoking. It also appears to be significantly more common in males than in females. Future research As the rhabdoid phenotype may exclusively be associated with certain missense mutations in the CK-8 gene (or, possibly, the vimentin gene ‚Äî see above), it may prove possible to develop specific monoclonal antibodies against certain peptides in these aberrant gene products that may target only rhabdoid cells with these specific mutations. Recent reports suggest that antibodies may be easier to get into the interior of cells than previously thought. History Although Colby and colleagues were the first to report a primary lung cancer with a rhabdoid phenotype in a paper published in 1995, cells with these characteristic features had been previously noted in 1978, when they were noted to occur in a rare and extremely aggressive form of kidney cancer that appears almost exclusively in young children called \\"Wilms tumor\\". LCLC-RP were first recognized as a distinct entity under the 3rd (published in 1999) revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) lung tumor histological typing scheme. Its placement in the classification schema went unchanged during the 2004 revision.

After this split the association drew followers mainly from workers' groups. Within the association an anarchist nucleus emerged, and overall the association was perceived as the most revolutionary grouping in the country at the time. Many members of the association declared themselves as atheists. By 1877 several members began adopting Marxist thoughts, a shift that resulted in yet another split.

It stars Richard Joseph Paul, Andrew Divoff, George Takei, Julie Newmar, Musetta Vander, Isaac Hayes and Meg Foster. It was followed by a sequel, Oblivion 2: Backlash (1996). The film was written by noted comic book writer Peter David. Plot The story has been described as a Space Western. Set in the year 3031 on a frontier planet light years away from Earth, a bizarre gang of futuristic desperadoes have their sight set on turning the tumbleweed town of Oblivion into their own private playground.Found footage The Original Cowboys And Aliens Movie The action begins with the murder of the town's Marshal Stone by a power-hungry villain called Red Eye (Andrew Divoff). Using a substance prized on the planet‚Äîwhich also happens to short out electrical devices‚ÄîRed Eye cheats his way to victory during a showdown on the street, killing Stone and disabling his cyborg deputy, Stell (Meg Foster). He and his cronies begin to bully and persuade the townspeople into allowing him to take over the town. Oblivion's mortician, Gaunt, who possesses supernatural ability to foresee death, seeks out the Marshal's son, Zack (Richard Joseph Paul), who is prospecting in the wilderness. Meanwhile, Zack saves a \\"native\\", Buteo (Jimmie F. Skaggs), from an untimely death by giant scorpion. They team up just before Gaunt arrives with the news of Marshal Stone's death, and they all journey together to Oblivion for the funeral. During a misadventure in a saloon along the way, Zack avoids violence, even when harangued by one of Red Eye's henchmen. After attending his father's funeral, Zack visits his old friend Doc Valentine (George Takei), an inventor whose technology had failed to protect the Marshal. At the local whorehouse, a townswoman, Mattie (Jackie Swanson), learns that Zack is not a coward, but an empath, who feels everything that those around him experience. This leads him to abhor violence. Buteo learns that one of Red Eye's associates had been responsible for the deaths of his wife and children, and seeks revenge. Challenging him to a fair fight, Buteo triumphs and his opponent is killed. Red Eye and his gang capture Buteo in retaliation, place him in stocks, and whip him. Sensing that something unsavoury is going on, Zack confronts his fears, saving Buteo and shooting many of the townspeople who had taken Red Eye's side. Apparently having won a victory, Zack celebrates until he learns that Mattie has been taken by Red Eye into the Badlands. He and his friends rush to save her, and in the process defeat all of the villains for good.

Background A member of a Connacht ecclesiastical family, Ua Dubhthaigh was born during the reign of King √Åed Ua Ruairc (r. 1067‚Äì1087). His family were natives of Lissonuffy in what is now north-east County Roscommon, and produced a number of abbots and bishops. One such was Flannagan Ruadh Ua Dubhthaigh, listed in his obituary of 1097 as \\"successor of Comman, and lector of Tuaim-da-ghualann\\". Other √ì Dubhthaigh who held high church offices included: * Domnall mac Flannac√°in Ua Dubthaig (died 1136) and Flannac√°n Ua Dubthaig (dead by 1152), Bishops of Elphin; * Dubthaigh √ì Dubhthaigh, Abbot of Cong, died 1223 * Muiredach Ua Dubthaig (fl. 1208), Bishop of Killala * Uilliam √ì Dubhthaigh, OFM (fl. 1290‚Äì1297), Bishop of Clonmacnoise * C√©le Ua Dubthaigh (died 1210), Bishop of Mayo. * Cadla Ua Dubthaig (fl. 1167‚Äì1201), Archbishop of Tuam. Archbishop of Connacht At the Synod of Rathbreasail in 1118, Tuam was named as the seat of a diocese corresponding roughly with the diocese of Elphin, whilst Cong was chosen as the seat of a diocese corresponding with the later archdiocese of Tuam in Iar Connacht. No bishop was given the title \\"bishop of Tuam\\" in the Irish annals before 1152, although the annals recorded some \\"bishops of Connacht\\". Domhnall Ua Dubhthaigh, who died at Clonmacnoise in 1136, is recorded in the Irish annals as \\"Archbishop of Connacht, and successor of Ciaran, head of the wisdom and hospitality of the province\\". It is unclear if he had retired, as Muireadhach was recorded as Archbishop in 1134. The Archbishop of Connacht appears to have been the forerunner of the archdiocese of Tuam, which was established at the Synod of Kells in 1152. Muiredhach's successor as first Archbishop of Tuam was √Åed Ua hOiss√≠n (1152‚Äì1161). Ambassador of Connacht In 1134 Ua Dubhthaigh acted as ambassador of King Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair to Cormac Mac Carthaigh, King of Munster, who had \\"again assembled the Munstermen, Leinstermen, Conmhaicne, the men of Midhe, the Galls of Dublin, Waterford, Wexford and Cork, and the U√≠ Eachach and Corca Laoighdhe on sea, to proceed into Connacht.\\" Ua Dubhthaigh was successful in brokering a peace deal \\"between Leath Cuinn and Leath Mogha. Cormac made peace with Toirdhealbhach in honour of the archbishop, and he himself went to Abhall Ceithearnaigh to confirm the peace with Toirdhealbhach.\\" This Treaty of Abhall Ceithearnaigh brought an end to a bitter war for supremacy between Connacht and Munster that had been on-going since the 1120s, and had the previous year resulted in the destruction of the castle and fleet of Dun Gallimhe, and Mac Carthaigh's defeat of Conchobhar Ua Flaithbheartaigh at the battle of An Cloidhe. Surety for Ruaidhri Ua Conchobair Following the treaty, Tairdelbach faced rebellion from his sons Aed and Ruaidhri. \\"Ruaidhri Ua Conchobhair and Uada Ua Concheanainn were taken prisoners by Toirdhealbhach Ua Conchobhair, they being under the protection of the successor of Iarlath and Ua Dubhthaigh, and of the Bachall Buidhe i.e. the yellow staff or crozier, and Ua Domhnallian.\\" Muireadh's intercession seems to have saved Ruaidhri, though both Aedh and Ua Concheannain were blinded. In 1143, the same crisis played out again: > His own son, i.e. Ruaidhri, was taken by Toirdhealbhach Ua Conchobhair, in > violation of laity and clergy, relics and protection. These were the > sureties: Muireadhach Ua Dubhthaigh, with the clergy and laity of Connacht; > Tadhg Ua Briain, lord of Thomond; Tighearnan Ua Ruairc, lord of Breifne; and > Murchadh, son of Gilla-na-naemh Ua Fearghail, lord of Muintir-Anghaile. The > clergy of Connacht, with Muireadhach Ua Dubhthaigh, fasted at Rath-Brenainn, > to get their guarantee, but it was not observed for them. The issue was resolved, if not ended, when in 1144 \\"Ruaidhri Ua Conchobhair, son of Toirdhealbhach, was released from fetters by his father, at the intercession of the clergy.\\" Surety violations The following year, Muireadhach was involved in yet another national dispute when Toirdhealbhach kidnapped the king of Mide while under Ua Dubhtaigh's protection: > Murchadh Ua Maeleachlainn, King of Meath and its Fortuatha, was taken > prisoner by Toirdhealbhach Ua Conchobhair, King of Connacht, while he was > under the protection of the relics and guarantees of Ireland. These were > they: the altar of Ciar√°n, with its relics; the shrine of Ciar√°n, called the > Oreineach; the Matha-mor; the abbot and the prior, and two out of every > order in the Church; Muireadhach Ua Dubhthaigh, the archbishop, the lord of > Connacht; the successor of Patrick, and the Staff of Jesus; the successor of > Feichin, and the bell of Feichin; and the Boban of Caeimhghin. All these > were between Toirdhealbhach and Murchadh, that there should be no treachery, > no guile, no defection of the one from the other, no blinding, no > imprisoning, and no circumscribing of Murchadh's territory or land, until > his crime should be evident to the sureties, and that they might proclaim > him not entitled to protection; however, he was found guilty of no crime, > though he was taken. He was set at liberty at the end of a month afterwards, > through the interference of his sureties, and he was conveyed by his > sureties into Munster; and the kingdom of Meath was given by Toirdhealbhach > to his own son, Conchobhar. This capture was effected as follows: a hosting > was made by Toirdhealbhach, as if to proceed into Munster; the Connachtmen, > the Conmaicni, and the Ui-Briuin, collected to one place, and Ua > Maeleachlainn was taken and conveyed to Dun-mor, together with the hostages > of Meath in general; but not the smallest part of Meath was injured on this > occasion. Ua Dubhtaigh would also have attended the Peace Conference of Tir dha Ghlas in the same year \\"Toirdhealbhach Ua Conchobhair and Toirdhealbhach Ua Briain ... with the chiefs of Munster and Connacht, both laity and clergy; and they made forms of peace according to what the clergy ratified between them.\\" Patron of the Arts Ua Dubhtaigh sponsored the creation of the Cross of Cong, which bears his name. He may also have been involved in the creation of the Corpus Missal, which dates from the early-to-mid 1130s. Last years Ua Dubhtaigh is not mentioned in the annals subsequent to 1144. His death is recorded as occurring at Cong in 1150. In 1168, \\"Flannagan Ua Dubhthaigh, bishop and chief doctor of the Irish in literature, history, and poetry, and in every kind of science known to man in his time, died in the bed of Muireadhach Ua Dubhthaigh, at Cunga.\\" A successor in the Archbishopric, Cadhla Ua Dubthaigh, was second Archbishop of Tuam and ambassador to Henry II (r. 1154‚Äì1189) in 1175. Muireadhach's precise relationship to Flannagan and Cadhla is uncertain.

The hoard includes two large bowls, a cup with two handles, plates and several drinking utensils. It was probably excavated around 1978 (the date of a modern coin found buried at the most likely site), and was bought by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1981 and 1982. After protracted pressure, in 2010, the treasure was transferred from the Metropolitan to Rome, before returning to Sicily.  History  The treasure was discovered in a building of Morgantina, perhaps hidden there at the sack of the city at the hands of the Romans in 211 BC. The creation of the objects is dated to around 240 BC, when the city was subject to Hieron II of Syracuse. According to some scholars, the treasure belonged to the hierophant, the high priest of Demeter and Persephone.

Emotional branding is successful when it triggers an emotional response in the consumer, that is, a desire for the advertised brand (or product) that cannot fully be rationalized. Emotional brands have a significant impact when the consumer experiences a strong and lasting attachment to the brand comparable to a feeling of bonding, companionship or love.‚ÄúCustomers define themselves through brands they use. The branded clothes they wear, the cars they drive, the drinks they consume, university they attended, favourite spots to hang out, and so on.‚ÄùNyimpini Mabunda, Smirnoff Vodka Marketing Manager. Examples of emotional branding include the nostalgic attachment to the Kodak brand of film, bonding with the Jim Beam bourbon brand, and love for the McDonald‚Äôs brand.Rossiter and Bellman History The practice of branding originated during the ancient times when it was used by craftsmen to imprint trademarks on their goods. Branding does not only help identify, but it also ensures the quality of goods and services the buyer and trader will purchase from the manufacturer. In history, cattle and sheep were branded with hot irons to indicate ownership. Humans were also marked to classify their social status. Slaves were marked to indicate ownership and criminals are labelled distinctly to show disgrace. Similarly, victims of the World War II Nazi persecution were branded with numbers as they entered the concentration camps. However, despite the history filled with negative connotation linked with branding, it has been replaced with a positive and more commercialized meaning, which relates to the use of categorising brand goods and services. The Industrial Revolution caused a massive shift in the future of branding as it transformed the importance and value of visual identification and trademarks. During this period, when railways and roadwork promoted a larger scope of product distribution in different areas, branding emerged as a way to differentiate various local and exported goods by simply using logos. This early form of branding created familiarity with different goods and it began to build trust among its loyal consumers. Companies were also focused on prioritizing the quality of product being distributed to ensure the return of loyal buyers and eventually, it will initiate growth of demand in the market. Apart from ensuring the quality of the goods, tradesmen were able to invent different forms of advertisements to reach their target market. New target markets were formed since the revolution did not just trigger a shift in the marketing industry, but it also instigated a powerful impact on social classes. Tradesmen began to promote their products to the rising middle class because of their buying power as a mass market. Sellers were aware that not many people were able to read newspapers as this new social class enters the market, hence they expanded their creative thinking and began experimenting new ways to reach out too potential customers. For example, via men wearing placards, banners streaming from hand held poles and umbrella signs. The rapid expansion of consumer goods during post World War II only increased existing goods in the market through amassed innovation, creating another major shifts in branding, which is more focused on superior features, unique ingredients and functional benefits. Businesses began to think innovatively to create brand identity using their products in attempt to associate lifestyle with brands. Pears soap brand became a highly demanded product because Thomas J. Barratt - known to be the ‚ÄúFather of Modern Advertising‚Äù ‚Äì always looked for new ways to endorse the product. Barratt used different techniques of creative advertising that would help the soap product appeal to the mass. Barratt used a series of themed posters using imagery and catchphrases to associate the brand with quality and luxury. The series has a reoccurring theme and one of the posters used an iconic painting by John Everett Millais entitled ‚ÄúBubbles‚Äù. The painting was inspired by Millais‚Äô grandson and it was illustrated out of his delight for the child. The painting portrays pure innocence as Millais took the opportunity to paint his grandson because of how exquisite he looked while holding the pipe to make bubbles. Barratt then used the painting‚Äôs meaning to be part of the Pears Soap message. The soap was added on the foreground pertaining that well-groomed middle-class children could enjoy domestic comforts and have aspirations of high society. Companies began to adapt Barratt‚Äôs technique to help achieve success on their own products, marking the beginning of modern emotional branding through the manipulation of human emotion to sell goods. Many businesses began to catch on to the trend of brand identity to distinguish their products from others in a growing market. In 2001, Marc Gob√© wrote Emotional Branding: The New Paradigm for Connecting Brands to People to delve into the idea of ‚Äúemotional branding‚Äù. Gob√© created the concept as part of his observation that there is a possible connection in an emotional level in a consumer-brand relationship. Gob√© wrote, ‚ÄúBrands must recognize that their emotional identity is not only a result of ads and products, but also corporate policy and stances. The message can be sent in subtle ways that a company is supportive of the gay community. The key components are inclusivity, sophistication, and subtlety.‚Äù He explains that emotional branding is distinct from the literal sense of brand awareness because of its ability to connect with its users in an emotional level from advertising to the physical product where it is able to make the user feel certain emotions the company aims to convey. It also reflects the company‚Äôs internal culture as the business must have a harmony and unified goal to be able to successfully reach their target market. Emotions towards a brand An emotional bond must be developed between the consumer and the product for a brand to be successful. Emotion is a mental state derived from ones intuitive feelings, which arise from reasoning, knowledge and cognitive appraisals of events or thoughts. Emotion may trigger actions depending on its nature and the reason for the person having emotion. Emotions happen as feedback of what one makes of a situation such as a brand consumption experience. Emotion is different from attitude, attitude is learned over time and controls responses whereas emotion is rarely consistent and occurs differently in separate events. Therefore, emotion is less consistent than attitude. Emotions arise on brand consumption and attitudes do not. Attitude is harder to change than emotion. Emotion plays a dominant role on the influence of brand experience and brand loyalty, ‚Äúmarketing practitioners need to pay more attention to customers emotions than to customers brand cognition‚Äù (Ding & Tseng, 2015). Emotions cause the positive or negative relationship between brand experience and brand loyalty. Consumers are likely to indulge in emotionally or culturally significant products. This is where experiential marketing is proven effective as it can attain brand loyalty by appealing to emotions. Emotions are triggered by fantasies, imagination, feelings, and pleasure experienced during consumption of an object. The promise of pleasure in consumption forms a powerful and ongoing motivation for consumers to want to experience the pleasurable feelings again and again. Consumers tend to be loyal to a brand because they want to re-experience the pleasurable feelings. Customer emotional attachment Emotional branding is critical in marketing as customer emotional attachment towards a brand such as feelings of sympathy, sadness, pride, and anger results in distinct meaning of the individual's environment and therefore has unique motivational implications towards the choice and decision making. Marketers use tactics such as a young child or an animal to capture the hearts of the audience. This bond between the customer and the brand affects the behaviour of the customer, which in turn can foster the firm‚Äôs profitability and the customer‚Äôs value to the firm. It is a basic human need to want to form an attachment. Customers can form emotional attachments to an array of objects such as collectibles, gifts and of course brands. Despite the fact that an emotional attachment to an object is unlikely to be similar in strength as an attachment between two humans, the fundamental properties and behavioural effects of emotional attachment are similar. Emotional attachment to a brand is underpinned by love, affection and connection towards the brand. These components of emotional attachment convey that a customer with a stronger emotional attachment is likely to be more committed and emotionally attached to a brand. Emotional attachment at a higher level is likely to increase a customer's emotional need for the brand. As the customer becomes more united with a brand, they are likely to stay relatively close with the brand as the presence of the brand offers feelings of enjoyment, delight, and security. This concludes that a customer with higher levels of attachment to a brand is more likely to commit to being in a long-term relationship with the brand. Marketers need to ensure they are reaching the right kind of emotions within the consumer, which correlate with the brand. Purpose The purpose of emotional branding is to create a bond between the consumer and the product by provoking the consumer's emotion. Vance Packard's The Hidden Persuaders speaks to the emotional response of consumers to advertising. It reads,\\"In the buying situation, the consumer generally acts emotionally and compulsively, unsubconsciously reacting to the images and designs that are associated with the product.\\"Packard, Vance. The Hidden Persuaders. New York: D. McKay, 1957. Print. The notion that emotion is not only associated with compulsiveness and irrationality, but is a subconscious reaction, is the framework that drives emotional branding theory. Today's most successful companies are said to have built relationships with consumers by engaging them in a personal dialogue that responds to their needs. Marketers who've broken through the clutter have done so by connecting with consumers and, thereby, have created strong emotional bonds through their brands.Making the Emotional Connection.(2001) Brandweek. General OneFile. Author Barbara Green states ‚ÄúYou have to have a love affair with the consumer- flirt with them, provide that titillating buzz. When that flirtatious relationship becomes a deep relationship, then you have a major brand.‚Äù Green, Barbara.(2003) Product is no longer enough; smart marketers know the way to the wallet is through the heart. National Jeweler: 40+. General OneFile. The process of Emotional Branding has an underlying concept based on four important factors which acts as a blueprint: Relationship, Sensorial Experience, Imagination and Vision. The relationship aspect of emotional branding establish a connection based on mutual respect for consumers by giving them an experience that touches them emotionally. It is critical that the companies are able to adapt with the rapid shifting of consumer trends. Many organizations are not aware of the changing trends in the consumer population, such as the growing number of multicultural races in the target market and the impact of feminism in our current generation, which is profoundly affecting consumer brand expectations. Researchers are yet to expound the depths of sensorial experience because it could potentially lead to deeper explanation as to how and why the use multisensory brand experience could trigger an emotional response from the consumer. Sensorial experience also explains how companies were able to apply and manipulate human emotions on the product to win the favour of consumers. Imagination is the piece of emotional branding that makes the whole process real. Creative approaches include an in-depth study of the design detail of a product from production, packaging, delivery in stores and advertisement. At this stage, these media must have developed a fresh, new way of appealing to the hearts of consumers. This challenges future institutions to continuously generate innovative ideas to keep the business growing in the market, as well as keeping the interest of present consumers. Envisioning the brand‚Äôs future plays an important factor in its long-term success. New competitors always enter the market and in order to maintain the market positioning, businesses should be prepared to innovate ideas to keep its edge. Maintaining the edge in the market equals to having fresh, new concepts to replace gaps in the market, thus engaging more potential customers to buy their product. This sort of principle would leave a lasting impression in the buyer‚Äôs minds and it would also set an example for the future generation that a business must create a leading brand which prioritizes its consumer needs. Gob√© created the ‚ÄúTen Commandments of Emotional Branding‚Äù to further explain the key differences between brand awareness in comparison with a brand‚Äôs ability to connect emotionally with its consumers, allowing the brand to express its desire to be preferred. _The Ten Commandments of Emotional Branding:_ i. From Consumers ‚Üí to People > Emotional branding allows companies to create a relationship with its > consumers that is based on mutual respect. This approach would help > potential consumers to have a positive attitude towards the product, > creating an attraction between the brand and the items being sold without > being forced to purchase. ii. From Product ‚Üí to Experience > Emotional branding creates an emotional memory between the buyer and the > product as a form of connection that goes beyond need. Need is based on > price and convenience, buying the product experience has an added value to > it which money won‚Äôt be able to buy. iii. From Honesty ‚Üí to Trust > Emotional branding builds trust. It is one of the fundamental values of a > brand which requires genuine effort from the company. This brings total > comfort to customers and it gives advantage to the company because the > buyers will put their brand as one of their top choices. iv. From Quality ‚Üí to Preference > Emotional Branding helps a brand become a consumer‚Äôs preference. The quality > is an essential factor to stay in business, however achieving preferential > status by consumers mean that the product made a real connection with its > users. v. From Notoriety ‚Üí to Aspiration > Emotional Branding shapes a business to be an aspiration instead of simply > being known. Brand awareness creates familiarity with its users but to be > attain success, the brand must be able to inspire the user to be desired. vi. From Identity ‚Üí to Personality > Emotional Branding teaches a company to build its personality to create a > lasting impact on users. Brand personalities form charismatic attitude that > would trigger positive emotional response towards the brand. vii. From Function ‚Üí to Feel > Emotional Branding makes experience as an important factor in creating brand > identity. The product may perform according to its practical function, but > emotional branding enables the user to have a deeper emotional experience > while using the product. viii. From Ubiquity ‚Üí to Presence > Similar with having an experience, emotional branding promotes brand > presence as it also creates an impact on potential users, ensuring a > permanent connection with people. ix. From Communication ‚Üí to Dialogue > Emotional branding encourages to have a conversation with its target > audience. It means that there should be a dialogue from the company relayed > to the target audience via personal message to share actual experiences with > the product. x. From Service ‚Üí to Relationship > Emotional branding helps create a special relationship between the brand and > its loyal users. Creating a relationship with the consumers is perhaps the > most important aspect of emotional branding because the company intends to > have a deep connection with its customers and it will create an important > bond among its users. Following this guideline will allow growing businesses to establish and develop deep relationship with their target market. This allows new associations to build strong foundations for their company culture, portraying personalities and specific values which reflect the entity as a whole. This way, consumers would create a closer bond with the brand as the product managed to trigger an emotional response the company was hoping to achieve from its users. Though it would be safe to think that the criteria consumers use to make their buying decisions were based on price and quality consideration, it is more likely that users will make choices based primarily on emotional instinct. Consumers will use their emotions as the foundation of their judgement and as the old saying goes ‚Äúfeelings are facts‚Äù. It is important to foster positive emotional connections not only when communicating with potential customers, but also it should extend to long-time audience to keep their loyalty. Emotional branding gives less focus on the quality, convenience and value of the goods but to be able to maintain a strong bond in a long term basis, it emphasizes the importance of building strong bond with their customers. Techniques Emotional branding uses the consumer's ability to process messages to promote a significant feeling associated with the brand. The two types of processing that a person can use to comprehend branding are Active Processing, which is learning that happens when deep, attentive processing is being applied, or, Implicit processing, which is when meaning can be processed without awareness.James,W.(1890) Principles of Psychology. Dover, New York.Heath,Robert.(2012)Seducing the Subconscious. Wiley Publishing Emotional branding is quite complex, in that a person can interpret a brand image through attentive processing, but once their emotions are provoked, the meaning that they take from the brand image can be implicitly processed, or in other words, subconsciously created. Author Antonio Damasio notes, ‚ÄúWe are more vulnerable when we are only vagely aware that our emotions are being influenced, and most vulnerable when we have no idea at all that our emotions are being influenced.‚ÄùDamasio, A.R.(2000)The Feeling of What Happens. Heinemann, London.Heath An example of this could be music playing in a store to create a subconscious mood. There are multiple techniques for achieving an emotional response to a brand. The first, and perhaps the most complicated method is by attaching the brand to a certain set of ideological values. This works best when the advertiser has done substantial amounts of research on the demographic audience, knowing what values and ideas will trigger an emotional response and connection to the brand. The values can be embedded into the brand through images and language. An example of this would be the family values and essence of childhood and bonding portrayed in Walt Disney World Ads. Emotional branding uses a series of themes and symbols to create meaning for a consumer.* In this sense, \\"theme\\" means a concept or story line that is present throughout an ad, and if integrated well-enough, throughout the brand. A \\"symbol\\" is representative of the theme. Vance Packard's The Hidden Persuaders suggests that the symbol represents a promise and consumers buy the promise. The text reads, \\"The cosmetic manufacturers are not selling Lanolin, they are selling hope. We no longer buy oranges, we buy vitality. We do not buy just an auto, we buy prestige.\\"Packard As suggested in Edward Bernays' The Engineering of Consent, Themes must appeal to human motivations in order to be successful. Motivation lies deep with a person's subconscious desires to achieve or meet certain goals. Bernays suggests that there is an extensive list of factors that drive motivation based on both ideological values and personal experience.Bernays, Edward L., and Howard Walden. Cutler. The Engineering of Consent. Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1955. Print. There are a few techniques used with symbolism. The first is making the theme and symbol of a brand continuously publicized. The second technique is making sure that the theme and symbol hold substance and promote a specific idea about the company. The company symbol needs to be adaptable to a changing society while standing firmly as a set of values. Symbols can represent multiple themes simultaneously, as suggested by Bernays. For example, a kitten can represent both playfulness and comfort. Symbols provide a promise for a sense of fulfillment associated with their brand. Vance Packard highlights the eight hidden needs that consumers have that themes and symbols attempt to sell. The eight needs are as follows: # Emotional security # Reassurance of worth # Ego-gratification # Creative outlets # Love objects # Sense of power # Sense of roots # ImmortalityPackard These needs, which are subconsciously emotion-based, serve as a foundation for emotional branding and allow marketers to create a self-fulfilling prophecy when it comes to consumer needs. People want to fulfill these needs, and advertisers promote the need to fulfill these needs in a perpetual cycle. A second method of emotional branding is making a literal statement about a product and its association to emotion. An example of this can be seen in a 1966 Hamlet Cigar ad that states ‚ÄúHappiness is a cigar called Hamlet.‚Äù Heath This associates the brand with a particular emotion in the most literal way possible. A third method of association to emotion is giving the consumer an emotional reaction to an ad. An example of this in advertising could be calming music playing simultaneously with images of people enjoying the product. This method works best when irrational emotions are evoked. For example, playing somber music with images of people struggling without the product would create an irrational connection to the product by playing on the consumer‚Äôs sadness. In one way, the brand creates a positive connotation with itself, in another, the brand creates a negative connotation of life without the product. These are both examples of emotional branding. It is important to note that emotional branding is something that comes with time and long standing presence. For example, attachment of the specific emotion of ‚Äúnostalgia‚Äù to the Kodak brand of film, ‚Äúbonding‚Äù to the Jim Beam bourbon brand, and ‚Äúlove‚Äù to the McDonald‚Äôs brand are built over time.Rossiter and Bellman Through repetition of these themes and symbols, these brand names have reached brand euphoria, where meaning no longer needs to be created, as enough branding has been done to solidify the brand image. Emotional branding is a notable tool used in advertising in many South and Southeast Asian countries particularly Thailand, India, Singapore and Malaysia. They normally run between 3 minutes to over 15 minutes in length and generally depict a story.http://www.techshu.com/blog/emotional-branding-7-indian-brands-tapping- emotionshttp://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/thailand-television- commercials-will-make-you-cry-or-at-least-get-a-bit-sad/news- story/8640bf2660dbd5c84140dcd7452b3c08 Criticism One of the more obvious criticisms of emotional branding is concerning the morality of manipulating human emotion, which is often an extremely vulnerable and irrational element of human thinking. Ethicist Richard Lippke notes that certain messages portrayed through branding should be criticized. These messages are: # Encouragement to accept emotional appeals, oversimplification, superficiality and shoddy standards of proof for claims. # An emphasis on ease and gratification rather than on austerity and restraint. # The notion that advertisers should allow people to show them how to live the good life. # A constant encouragement to consume lest one miss out on something new. # The false belief that products will deliver the non-market good with which they are associated.Phillips, Michael. (1997) \\"Ethics & Manipulation in Advertising : Answering a Flawed Indictment.\\" Greenwood Press. (page 6) A similar criticism of emotional branding concerns it's very origin as the use of propaganda. Many criticisms have been formed concerning advertising's relation to propaganda, as the very first ideas about public relations and many ideas about advertising and branding came from the same man, Edward Bernays, who perfected the art of propaganda. A third criticism of emotional branding is in reference to the growing \\"sameness\\" of products on the market and the desperate attempt of marketers to distinct their brand from others. From The Hidden Persuaders: \\"The greater the similarity between products, the less part reason really plays in brand selection.\\"Packard Because of the amount of competition today, the industry calls for more ways to subliminally affect the consumer. The very thought of affecting a consumer based on psychological research is controversial in itself and has been subject to extreme criticism throughout the development of the advertising industry. Because of both the likeness of products on the market today and the clutter of advertisements, more creative tactics, which may be criticized by some, are being used to subliminally affect the mind.

The Treaty of Glanmire Muirchertach Ua Briain (c. 1050‚Äìc. 1119) was both King of Munster and High King of Ireland. He was of the D√°l gCais dynasty, and a great-great grandson of Brian Boru (c. 937-1014). Muirchertach became seriously ill in 1114, and his rule suffered as a result. Dissension between him and his brother, Diarmaid, Dux of Cork, was exacerbated by hostilities from other major Irish kingdoms such as Connacht, Aileach and Leinster. This gave Ua Briain vassals, such as the Mac Carthaigh brothers, the chance to assert their independence. Tadhg Mac Carthaigh was effective ruler of south-west Munster in 1118 when the sons of Diarmaid Ua Briain fled from the new king, Brian Ua Briain. In an attempt to subborne Mac Carthaigh, Ua Briain engaged him and his army at Glanmire but was defeated; he himself was killed by Turlough mac Diarmaid. News of the defeat roused Muirchertach from his retirement, regaining the kingship of Munster and led a large army south, accompanied by his allies, the kings of Connacht, Mide, and Breifne. However, the most powerful of the kings, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088‚Äì1156) found it expedient for his own purposes to keep Munster divided, so he made \\"an enduring treaty\\" with Tadgh, formally recognising him as the first King of Desmond, while the sons of Diarmaid Ua Briain were given Thomond. With Munster divided into two separate kingdoms, Toirdelbach became the only contender for High King of Ireland, a position he held with opposition till his death in 1156. When Tadgh rebelled, Toirdelbach invaded and ravaged Desmond in 1121, 1122 and 1123. At the end of the latter year Tadgh became seriously ill; before his death he resigned the kingship and Cormac took his place. Cormac, King of Desmond Early in 1124 Ua Conchobair brought the fleet of Connacht down to Munster to assert his dominion over Thomond and Desmond. However, an unexpected attack from Mide and Breifne forced his attention away. Cormac took the opportunity to make an alliance with the kings of Laghin, Mide and Breifne, making ready to invade Connacht. They were met at the bridge of √Åtha Luain over the Shannon only to find Ua Conchobhair already there with a massive army. Because Mac Carthaigh was the apparent leader of the revolt, Ua Conchobhair promptly executed the hostages of Desmond, which included Mael Sechlainn Mac Carthaigh, Cormac's son. Realiseing that Ua Conchobair could only be defeated at the cost of huge casualties, Cormac \\"returned home mournfully.\\" In 1125 Mac Carthaigh seized the city of Limerick from Ua Briain, an act which was seen as symbolically assuming the kingship of all Munster. It was also an affront to Ua Conchobair, now fully recognised as Ard R√≠. The following year the Ard R√≠ attacked and decisively defeated Mac Carthaigh at his military encampment in Osraige. This resulted in Cormac's deposition in 1127, been replaced by his brother Donnchadh. Donnchadh submitted to Ua Conchobair after the siege of Cork city on Saint Brigid's Day 1127, along with O'Mahony, O'Donoghue, O'Keef, O'Bric, O Conchobhair Ciarraige. Cormac was tonsured, took Holy Orders, and retired to the monastery of Lismore.

He was made marshal of France in 1614 by Louis XIII. Background and early life The existence of lords of Roquelaure is documented to at least the twelfth century. The Roquelaure family held the fief in conjunction with the lords from whom they received it. The family acquired the seigneurie of Saint-Aubin in the early fourteenth century when Brunissent de Savaillan, lady of Saint-Aubin and widow of Bertrand II of Roquelaure, granted the fief to her son Pierre de Roquelaure after her second marriage.La Chesnaye des Bois, 306, 308. Antoine de Roquelaure was the third son of G√©raud, lord of Roquelaure, Gaudoux, Montbert and Le Longard, (died 1557) and Catherine de Bezolles. As such he was originally destined by his father for an ecclesiastical career, but at his father's death, he inherited the seigneurie of Le Longard and placed himself in the service of Antoine of Navarre. Association with Navarre Jeanne III of Navarre held him in such high regard that after the death of her husband Antoine in 1563, she granted him the part of the fief of Roquelaure that the crown of Navarre possessed and placed him in the service of her son, Henry, who was then only nine years old. At eighteen, Antoine de Roquelare was still young, and Henry soon appreciated the loyalty and devotion of his brilliant companion. Roquelaure eventually came into the full possession of the fief after the death of his two elder brothers, Jean-Bernard and Bernard in the Wars of Religion.La Chesnaye des Bois, 311 Roquelaure formed part of the retinue that accompanied the young Huguenot king to Paris on the occasion of his marriage to Marguerite of Valois in 1572 and participated in his escape four years later from confinement during a hunt. He formed part of the group of confidants who counseled the king at his court at N√©rac and participated in the siege of Eauze in 1579. In the service of France Coat of arms of the Roquelaures, today used by the commune of Roquelaure-Saint-Aubin After Henry became the legitimate heir to the throne of France in 1589, Roquelaure followed him in all his battles to secure the crown: Coutras, Arques and Ivry. As a Catholic, Roquelaure played an important role in convincing Henry to adopt that faith to strengthen his hold on the French crown. His service gained him many charges and benefices which turned him into one of the most important persons of the kingdom. He was made master of the wardrobe in 1589, a knight of the Order of the Holy Spirit and lieutenant-general of Upper Auvergne, captain of the Palace of Fontainebleau, and later governor of the County of Foix, lieutenant-general of Guyenne in 1597 and mayor of Bordeaux. On 16 May 1610, Roquelaure was with the king in the carriage in which he was murdered by Fran√ßois Ravaillac. During the regency, Marie de Medicis entrusted to him the suppression of cities which had risen against it, and for these services he was honored in 1614 with the title of Marshal of France by Louis XIII.Expilly, 384. He resigned the post of governor of Guyenne in 1613 and only kept the office of governor of Lectoure, which allowed him to return to his domains. He died in Lectoure in 1625 at the age of 81 years. Descendants In 1581 he married Catherine d'Ornesan, who died in 1601. They had six children, but he had no male descendants at the time of the death of his son Jean-Louis in 1610. He remarried in 1611 with Susanne de Bassabat, with whom he had twelve children, among them Gaston-Jean-Baptiste de Roquelaure (1617‚Äì1683), his main heir. A celebrated wit, Gaston was created the first duke of Roquelaure and peer of France in 1652 (although the peerage remained unregistered) and was appointed governor of Guyenne in 1679. Gaston's son, Antoine Gaston de Roquelaure (1656‚Äì1738), carried on the family reputation for wit. At a young age served in the Franco-Dutch War and later in the Nine Years' War. He was made governor of Languedoc in 1706 and received the marshal's b√¢ton in 1724. The second duke of Roquelaure also gave his name to the \\"roquelaure\\" or \\"roquelaire\\", a knee-length cloak. His daughter, Fran√ßoise, married Louis Bretagne de Rohan-Chabot (son of Louis de Rohan- Chabot) in 1708 and as a result the duchy of Roquelaure passed to this family, who sold it, eventually coming into the possession of the king. The king sold it to Guillaume Dubarry in 1772. A marquisate of Roquelaure was created in 1766 in favor of Charles de Roquelaure, lord of Saint-Aubin, but it should not be confused with the original peer-duchy.La Chesnaye des Bois, 306.

The first commercial vessel to be driven by steam turbines, King Edward was remarkably successful for a prototype, serving as a Clyde steamer for half a century from 1901 until 1951, interrupted only by service in the two world wars. The success of the vessel quickly led to the adoption of turbine propulsion for all manner of merchant vessels, from channel ferries and coastal steamers to transatlantic liners. Background In 1803, Charlotte Dundas showed the practicality of steam power for marine use, and in 1812 Henry Bell's PS Comet began the first commercially successful steamboat service in Europe, sailing on the River Clyde between Glasgow and Helensburgh. Others soon followed, and by mid century a large fleet of Clyde steamers competed for holiday and excursion traffic down the River and Firth of Clyde. By the end of the century paddle steamers had reached a peak of design, with a maximum economic operating speed of around 19 knots (35 km/h), but speed was at a premium, particularly on the longer routes such as sailings from Glasgow to Inveraray and Campbeltown. Up to this time, vessels had been powered by reciprocating steam engines. Steam was generated by boilers, and piped to cylinders wherein it drove pistons, the back-and-forth motion of which was converted to rotary motion by connecting rods. Early vessels were driven by paddle wheels, but at mid-century screws became more prevalent. Although increased boiler pressures and the reuse of partially expanded steam in compound engines greatly increased efficiency, the continual creation and destruction of momentum of their heavy reciprocating parts each turn of the crankshaft put great strain on the engines, which required constant maintenance.Baker & Tryckare, p. 98: \\"[W]ith reciprocating engines there was a limit to the speeds attainable within given weight and strength limitations. The breaking of connecting rods when operating at full power had caused severe damage.\\" The modern steam turbine, invented by Charles A. Parsons in 1884, overcomes these problems by having only rotating parts, and no reciprocating parts. In 1894 he formed a syndicate to build a small experimental steam launch, Turbinia. In a famous publicity stunt, Parson's steam launch sped uninvited past warships in the Solent at the 1897 Review of the Fleet held on the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria's accession to the throne. Turbinia raced past them at the unheard-of speed of 34 knots (63 km/h), far outstripping the ships of the Royal Navy sent to intercept.Woodman, pp. 199‚Äì200.Baker & Tryckare, pp. 98‚Äì99. In January 1898 the Admiralty ordered a turbine-powered destroyer, Viper, and later that year a typical lightly built destroyer being built as a private venture was fitted with turbines. The Admiralty purchased this ship after requiring strengthening of the hull, and named the vessel HMS Cobra. Both destroyers were launched in 1899, and both were soon lost for reasons unrelated to their machinery, and before the Admiralty could obtain substantial experience with turbine propulsion. Such experience was needed before the turbine could obtain wide acceptance, as there had been problems in its development. The reciprocating steam engine, for all its theoretical faults, had been perfected over eight decades of development. Its manufacturing and operating characteristics were widely known; it had attained a high degree of fuel efficiency, and functioned economically across a range of speeds. In contrast, the turbine was new; the seagoing prototype Turbinia experienced engine problems in its expensive development; and its theoretical advantage in low vibrations had not been realized, as turbine blades had failed due to vibrations, as well as contacting the casing, leading to catastrophic destruction within the turbines. In short, it was an expensive and unproven technology. From a records of a later discussion, it appears that Archibald Denny, a partner in the shipbuilders William Denny and Brothers, had already been impressed by a technical paper by Parsons and had approached him with the suggestion of using steam turbines to power a merchant vessel. Denny apparently invited Clyde railway steamboat owners to sponsor the venture, but nothing came of these exploratory informal approaches. It was left to one of the owners of private steamer fleets to take on this challenge. Turbine syndicate Captain John Williamson had followed his father Captain James Williamson in owning and running Clyde Steamers, purchasing his first ship in 1893 and buying and selling ships to build up a fleet. This included the PS Strathmore, built to order in 1897, which took over the service running from Fairlie Pier railway station to Campbeltown, and proved reliable. He seems to have given independent consideration to introducing a turbine steamer, and agreed to take this on. Towards the end of 1900 a syndicate was formed in which he agreed to personally operate the proposed ship for its first season without pay, William Denny and Brothers would build the hull and boilers, and the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company was to provide the machinery. Each member of the syndicate provided one third of the cost of the vessel, estimated at ¬£33,000 (), plus ¬£267 () towards initial working and running expenses. On 22 January 1901 the Glasgow and South Western Railway minuted an agreement in its official records, backing this improvement to a service from its railway terminal into areas which its parliamentary Act prohibited its own vessels from serving: Design Foredeck, with pilothouse and bridge The hull design of King Edward was closely based by Denny on its successful steamer, PS Duchess of Hamilton, and shared the main dimensions. The hull was 250 ft 6 in (76.35 m) long and 30.1 feet (9.17 m) in breadth. Depth was about 10 ft 6 in (3.20 m) and the vessel drew about 7 ft (2.13 m) of water.Gardiner, p. 96. Tonnage was measured at 502 gross and 182 net.Lloyd's Register (1945‚Äì46), p. KIM-KIN. Republished by Plimsoll Ship Data. The register for other years measures gross at 551 and net at 222. E.g., Lloyd's Register (1930‚Äì31) p. KIN. The ship accommodated 1,966 passengers. The machinery was amidships down in the hull, with a lower deck fore and aft, the crew's quarters being located towards the bow.Baker & Tryckare, p. 111. A full-length main deck was above, enclosed almost to the stern, with circular portholes over much of the length and larger rectangular windows aft.Baker & Tryckare, p. 121 (image). First- class accommodations were aft, and second-class fore, with dining saloons for each class on the lower deck. The superstructure or promenade deck was open, save for a pilothouse and bridge, a house around the uptakes, and a small house just aft of amidships. The promenade deck planking showed provision for conversion to paddle propulsion, in case the turbines proved a failure. Uniquely at that time, a short flying deck supported the two funnels, and a lifeboat on each side of the funnels. The power plant consisted of Scotch marine boilers providing steam at 150 psi (10.34 bar) to Parsons turbines. Steam first drove a high-pressure turbine, which turned a propeller shaft with a 57 inch (1,448 mm) screw at up to 700 revolutions per minute. Exhaust steam from the centre turbine drove two low-pressure turbines, one on either side, turning wing shafts each with two 40 inch (1,016 mm) screws, at up to 1,000 rpm. (In 1905, the fore propellers were removed from the outboard shafts,Maber, pp. 33‚Äì34. which actually improved performance.) The drives were ungeared, and the speeds of the turbines were the speeds of the shafts. After final use in the lower-pressure outboard turbines, the steam, now expanded 125-fold, exhausted into condensers.Baker & Tryckare, p. 112. Astern turbines operated on the two wing shafts, with the central shaft idling when the ship was backing. The aim was for a speed of 20 knots (37 km/h), outpacing other Clyde steamers while providing economy in fuel, rather than the high speeds of the navy vessels. The propulsion system differed from that of the lightly built destroyers, which operated under higher steam pressure and drove four propeller shafts. Denny gave the new ship the yard number 651. Launch and trials, performance TS King Edward on trials in the Firth of Clyde off Skelmorlie, between 17 and 28 June 1901 On 16 May 1901 the vessel was launched by Mrs. Parsons, who named the ship King Edward by royal permission. The ship's colours were those of Captain John Williamson ‚Äì black hull, white saloons and white funnels with a black top, flying the well remembered \\"star and crescent\\" pennant of the old \\"Turkish fleet\\" of Clyde steamers. The builders had tested the hull form in their own tank, and hoped to attain a speed of 20 knots (37.04 km/h) with the turbine machinery. On 14 June the first steam trial was supervised personally by C. A. Parsons and John Williamson, then on 17 June during manoeuvring trials in calm weather the mean speed of two runs over the measured mile at Skelmorlie was 18.66 knots (34.56 km/h). After full hull cleaning at Scott's of Greenock a further series of trials took place on 24 June: in seven return runs over the mile, the best mean speed attained was 19.7 knots (36.48 km/h). On the next day at the Pointhouse yard of A. & J. Inglis the central propeller of 4 ft (1.22 m) diameter was exchanged for one of 4 ft 9 inches (1.45 m) diameter, and the outer propellers of 2 ft 10 inches (0.86 m) diameter were exchanged for propellers 3 ft 4 inches (1.02 m) diameter. Trials on 26 June with smooth sea conditions and a light breeze achieved a mean of 20.48 knots (37.93 km/h) and a fastest single run at 20.57 knots (38.1 km/h). At the official trial on 28 June, invited guests came aboard off Craigendoran, and the ship then sailed to Campbeltown with intermediate visits to Dunoon, Rothesay, Largs, Fairlie and Lochranza, where Duchess of Hamilton waited with a special party of members of the Institute of Naval Architects. The two ships raced down Kilbrannan Sound and King Edward passed the paddle steamer without difficulty. A dinner in the after saloon was presided over by Peter Denny, who with other speakers commented on the speed and smoothness of the turbine steamer, in contrast to the rhythmic surging motion and vibration associated with all paddle steamers. The machinery developed 3,500 ihp and 399 nhp. King Edward's performance was compared with that of Duchess of Hamilton, the similar vessel built by Denny at about the same time, but with reciprocating machinery driving paddle wheels. In actual service on the Firth the turbine vessel averaged 18.5 knots (34.28 km/h), about two knots (3.7 km/h) faster than Duchess. In 1902 James Denny compared the 20.5 knots (38 km/h) achieved on trial with an estimated maximum using the most modern triple expansion reciprocating engines of 19.7 knots (36.48 km/h), which would have involved considerably increased initial and fuel costs, and said that this showed the turbines giving a 20% increase in power. He said that fuel efficiency of King Edward had been found to increase in proportion to speed, and was best when the turbines were worked at full capacity. The ship burned more coal per knot of speed than reciprocating engined steamers only when operating at a lower speed range of between 17 and 18 knots (31.5 to 33.3 km/h), corresponding to around 50% of maximum power output. Career King Edward entered service on Monday 1 July 1901, with a daily sailing leaving the Glasgow and South Western Railway's Prince's Pier, Greenock, at an advertised time of 8.40 a.m., visiting Dunoon and Rothesay before calling at the G&SWR;'s Fairlie Pier railway station at 10.20 a.m. then sailing across the Firth to Lochranza and on to arrive at Campbeltown at 12.20. For a small additional cost, horse-drawn coach trips from Campbeltown to Machrihanish offered a \\"Daily Excursion to the Shores of the Atlantic\\". On the return voyage, the ship left Campbeltown at 3 p.m. and passengers could catch a train at the railway pier to arrive back at 6.18 p.m. at St Enoch railway station, Glasgow. The G&SWR; also offered an Isle of Arran tour, taking PS Juno from Prince's Pier via the Kyles of Bute to Brodick, then travelling by coach to Lochranza to catch King Edward for the return voyage, or a similar arrangement in reverse order. In July 1901 a novel evening cruise was introduced, with trains leaving Glasgow at 6.5 p.m. and meeting King Edward at Greenock for a cruise of about two hours \\"with music on board\\", after which a train returned, to be back at 10.25 p.m. in Glasgow. The ship proved very popular, attracting passengers by the novelty of turbine sailing aided by splendid summer weather and additional traffic from the Glasgow International Exhibition of 1901, and the season was extended to the end of September, then the ship was laid up for the winter. Both of the steam turbine destroyers were wrecked in 1901. On 3 August ran aground on a reef and became a total loss. On 17 September in heavy weather broke in two and sank rapidly. The crew was accompanied by many Parsons personnel, and only 12 survived of the 79 on board. This left King Edward as the only surviving turbine steamship and raised questions over turbine propulsion, but the losses were soon attributed to weakness in the lightly constructed hulls of the destroyers. The season's sailings of King Edward were so successful that the overdraft was cleared. Meeting the terms of the agreement between the syndicate members, the newly formed company Turbine Steamers, Ltd. acquired the ship. Captain John Williamson, who became managing director as well as having substantial holdings in the company, immediately ordered a new ship. On 3 October he accepted the offer of Denny's dated two days earlier to build an enlarged King Edward for ¬£38,500 (),, incorporating turbine machinery which Mr. Parson agreed to supply to Denny's for ¬£10,500 (),. The new turbine vessel was launched on 8 April 1902 as , and after an initial cruise on 31 May, took over the Campbeltown run on Monday 2 June. King Edward began a new service from Prince's Pier to Fairlie and on up Loch Fyne to Tarbert and Ardrishaig. In 1904 this route was extended to Inveraray, competing with MacBrayne's paddle steamers Columba and Iona, and Lord of the Isles run by the Inveraray Company. In the winter of 1905‚Äì1906 King Edward was altered to add a cloakroom and a smokeroom on the main deck, under a new top deck extending aft over the saloon staircase but not forward to the bridge. The ship's boats were relocated at the after end of this new deck, so that they no longer obstructed the view of the funnels from each side. After a \\"Grand Saturday afternoon opening cruise to Kilbrannan Sound\\" on 12 May 1906, the ship resumed the run from Greenock to Inveraray. The route was changed so that instead of going via Fairlie and Garroch Head, the ship went through the Kyles of Bute and gave direct competition to the other steamers on the run. The timetable of Lord of the Isles was accelerated as much as it could, and the steerage fare cut to 3 shillings and 6 d (), against the turbine steamer fare of 5 shillings (), but the paddle steamer still lost traffic. King Edward always reached Inveraray first, and refused to leave the berth to allow the paddler in. An attempt to get Inveraray Town Council to intervene failed as the vote was tied with 6 on each side, and the provost declined to settle the matter with a casting vote. By 1912 the battle was over, and Lord of the Isles (together with the paddler Edinburgh Castle which was also owned by an amalgamation of the Inveraray and Loch Goil companies) was taken over by Turbine Steamers Ltd. During the Great War, King Edward ferried troops across the Channel. On its return voyage after serving on the White Sea, the ship survived a terrible storm. After the war the ship returned to the former service, switching to the Glasgow‚ÄìRothesay route in 1927. A merger of shipowners in 1919 had formed Williamson-Buchanan Steamers Ltd. which still traded as John Williamson and Company and retained as standard white funnels with black tops. In 1927, King Edward was transferred to this fleet for \\"all the way\\" sailings from Glasgow. Sailings included trips via Rothesay through the Kyles of Bute, and Sunday afternoon trips to Lochgoilhead which left Glasgow at 2.15 and arrived back at 9.30. The \\"first cabin\\" fare, with cooked high tea, was 5 shillings and 6 pence. At the end of the 1935 season the London, Midland and Scottish Railway took over the company, maintaining the same colour scheme. The company remained a separate entity until it was wound up in 1943. In World War II King Edward ran for a time on the peacetime route, then became a tender for troopships arriving at the Clyde. After the war the vessel resumed the Rothesay route, now with yellow funnels, until withdrawn in 1951 after some 50 years of service. The ship was broken up in 1952, but its turbine engines were saved and displayed in the Glasgow Transport Museum.Transport and Technology Collections, \\"Maritime Transport: Marine Engineering\\", pp. 42‚Äì43. Influence King Edward's performance \\"revolutionised the world of excursion steamers.\\"Gardiner, p. 95. The vessel demonstrated the ability of steam turbines to drive ships at high speed, without the vibrations inherent in reciprocating steam plants. This success led almost immediately to orders for several other turbine Clyde steamers, and other vessels for short-sea trades across the Irish Sea and English Channel.Gardiner, p. 27. Although some mariners questioned the advisability of turbine propulsion for larger ships, King Edward's performance led the Allan Line to order turbine machinery from Parsons for new transatlantic liners Victorian and Virginian, both launched in 1904. And within five years of King Edward's maiden voyage, the reliability and superiority of turbine power had been sufficiently well-established that the Cunard Line, supported by the British government, specified turbine propulsion for its great ocean liners Lusitania and Mauretania, vastly larger than King Edward.Gardiner, pp. 154-55.

All known L17 downstream elements were detected immediately downstream of genes encoding the L17 subunit of the ribosome, and therefore might be in the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) of these genes. The element is found in a variety of lactic acid bacteria and in the genus Listeria. Ribosomal protein leader RNAs in bacteria are found upstream of genes encoding ribosomal subunits, i.e., in their 5' untranslated regions. They bind the protein encoded by the adjacent gene, and are part of a feedback mechanism to regulate the abundance of the relevant ribosomal subunit proteins. Although regulation of an upstream gene is rare in bacteria, the L17 downstream element is positioned so as to perform feedback regulation from the 3' UTR. An RNA transcript overlapping was detected by microarray experiments that overlaps a predicted L17 downstream element RNA. The overlapping RNA was called SR79100.

He came to power by helping his brother Byattaba stage a coup against King Binnya U. He was also a key figure who started the Forty Years' War (c. 1385‚Äì1424) between the Mon- speaking Hanthawaddy Pegu and the Burmese-speaking Ava. Brief Laukpya was appointed governor of Myaungmya, a key port in the Irrawaddy delta by King Binnya U. In 1364, Laukpya's eldest brother Byattaba, then a senior official, seized the Martaban province south of Donwun while Laukpya seized the entire Bassein province. In 1371/72, the rebel brothers and the king signed a treaty that allowed the brothers to be his nominal vassals. In 1384, the brothers refused to extend the same recognition to Binnya U's son and successor Razadarit. In 1385, as Razadarit prepared to march to the delta, Laukpya sought assistance from King Swa Saw Ke of Ava with the promise of submission to Ava. Laukpya's wrote to Swa:Htin Aung 1967: 88 :Glorious king, the ungrateful son, who was rebel when his father was alive, now has dared to ascend the great Binnya U's throne, assuming the title of \\"Razadarit\\". Before he can make his position secure, I beg my lord to attack Pegu both by land and by water. Your humble servant holds both Bassein and Myaungmya, and shall attack Pegu by water. When you have achieved your great triumph, take all the treasures for yourself; as to your humble servant, grant him only the annual revenue. Swa's acceptance of Laukpya's invitation resulted in the Forty Years' War between Ava and Pegu. Swa's inaugural invasions of Hanthawaddy in 1385‚Äì86 and 1386‚Äì87 could not break Razadarit's defenses. In 1388/89, Razadarit attacked the delta. Razadarit's army could not take Myaungmya, which was heavily fortified, and was defeated at Bassein which was defended by Laukpya's three sons. Then Laukpya ventured out of his defenses, and was promptly captured by Razadarit's forces. Myaungmya surrendered in 1390. The entire delta followed.Phayare 1967: 70 Laukpya's son Bya Kon and son-in-law Bya Kyin both fled to Ava.

The floods saw inundation of the towns of Charleville, Roma, St George and Theodore among others. Major rivers affected include the Balonne River, Bulloo River, Paroo River and the Dawson River. Floods The floods were caused by rainfall generated by a monsoon trough described by a Bureau of Meteorology forecaster as \\"almost like a tropical cyclone over land\\". Over the period 1-3 March, rainfall totals of between 100‚Äì300 mm (4 to 12 inches) were observed in the area. This water ran into already saturated rivers and creeks in the area. The floods are estimated to have affected an area of Queensland larger in size than the Australian state of Victoria and thought to have caused hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage to infrastructure such as roads and railways. Losses from cotton crops destroyed at Theodore and the area around St George and Dirranbandi are expected to be significant. The floods, described by the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries Tim Mulherin as the \\"worst flood in 120 years\\" are however expected to provide a billion dollar boost to the local economy, following the \\"worst drought since Federation\\" The floods have seen a large increase in the Australian plague locust population and the Australian Plague Locust Commission is concerned the locusts will head south and destroy what is expected to be a bumper winter grain crop. The flood has seen an increase in the mosquito population with fogging taking place in Charleville, Augathella and Morven. Floodwaters are continuing to head downstream with the town of Goodooga, New South Wales in north western New South Wales cut off by road on 20 March 2010. Rising levels in the Bokhara and Culgoa Rivers have seen the evacuation of Goodooga and Weilmoringle. Wanaaring on the Paroo River has been cut off from Bourke but the town itself was protected by a levee. The flood has increased the amount of water held in the Murray-Darling river systems, allowing South Australia an additional 400 gigalitres of water entitlement. A river expert expects much of the floodwater will reach the Darling River and the Menindee Lakes and then through onto the Murray River. Lake Eyre is also expected to receive much of the floodwaters flowing down the Cooper Creek and Diamantina River. On 21 March, Cyclone Ului made landfall in southeastern Queensland, producing heavy rains and flooding.

It consists of of sand, a by-product of kaolinite production over the years. The sand dune is now used as a ski resort for sand skiing and sandboarding, in addition to other activities. Sand-skiing and sandboarding By the 1950s the pile of sand had grown large enough that people experimented skiing on it and in 1956 a ski club was formed. Unique for this hill, skiing is done directly on the sand and as a result, its operating season is inverse with ski areas elsewhere - it only opens in summer, even though the area does snow in winter. The hill is home to the Sandboarding World Championships. Recent history The area was extensively renovated in 2007. In addition to the ski hill, there is also camping facilities, pool, geopark, and trails. In 2009 a funicular elevator has been installed to the top of the hill.

WCTA was a class D facility licensed to broadcast with 250 watts of power on a frequency of 810 kHz, operating only during daylight hours to protect both KGO in San Francisco, California, and WGY in Schenectady, New York, from skywave interference. The broadcast license was held by Robert Davis, through licensee Alamo Media LLC. The station, established in 1983, fell silent on and off from 2008 through June 2012 before resuming normal operation. Programming The station was launched in 1983 airing a full service format mixing country & western and middle of the road music with news and farm programming. By the late 1980s the station has shifted to a pure country & western music format with limited news programming. This lasted through the mid-1990s when the station shifted to a mix of Top 40 and adult contemporary music. As the 2000s began, the station was back to country music with some Christian music block programming. In its last few years before falling silent in 2008 due to the declining health of the station's owner, WCTA broadcast a news/talk/sports radio format, including select programming from USA Radio Network. History In 1979, Crockett Broadcasting Corporation applied to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit for a new broadcast radio station. The FCC granted this permit on February 20, 1980, with a scheduled expiration date of February 20, 1981. The new station was assigned call sign \\"WCTA\\". In August 1981, Crockett Broadcasting notified the FCC that control of the company had passed from Ralph Clenney and Branson Townsen to Roy Davis. The FCC approved the move on October 5, 1981. After a series of extensions, construction and testing were completed in September 1983 and the station was granted its broadcast license on November 28, 1983. The station began broadcasting a full service format mixing music, news, and information. In June 1986, Crockett Broadcasting Corporation reached a deal to sell WCTA to Charles C. Allen. The deal was approved by the FCC on August 13, 1986. In August 1990, Charles C. Allen contracted to sell WCTA to Gary Morris Reasons for $75,000. The sale was approved by the FCC on October 10, 1990, and the transaction was formally consummated the same day. In December 1996, Gary Morris Reasons notified the FCC of his intent to transfer the WCTA broadcast license to Billy Hugh Williams. The transaction gained FCC approval on February 21, 1997, and formal consummation of the deal occurred on March 19, 1997. After a period of sporadic operation, the station went completely dark in early 2008 due to the declining health of license holder Billy Hugh Williams. The station reported to the FCC that it had been on and off the air for various periods from that time through 2012 but that normal operation was resumed in June 2012. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows the FCC to terminate a broadcast licensed if a station fails to broadcast for one full year, the station is still licensed by the FCC. The station's license was renewed through 2020. Effective October 5, 2015, WCTA's license was assigned to Robert Davis' Alamo Media LLC in exchange for forgiveness of a debt of $43,500. Its license expired August 1, 2020.\\"Public Notice: Radio License Expirations\\", FCC. July 15, 2020. Retrieved August 3, 2020.

It annually hosts the Iowa State Fair in late summer. The state fair was begun in Iowa in 1854 and the current fairgrounds were established in 1886. The fairgrounds were listed as an historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 as the Iowa State Fair and Exposition Grounds. History The Iowa State Fair was held in a different community every two years after it was first established. The first fair was held in Fairfield in 1854. The other towns that hosted the fair included Muscatine, Oskaloosa, Iowa City, Dubuque, Burlington, Clinton, Keokuk and Cedar Rapids. The state fair moved to Des Moines permanently in 1878. The fairgrounds were initially located on the west side of the city between 38th Street on the east, 42nd Street on the west, Center Street on the north and Grand Avenue on the south. In 1886 the fairgrounds were moved to the east side of town on University Avenue. The property had previously been the Calvin Thornton Farmstead. with Document erroneously mentions Charles Thornton many times, and only one time mentions Calvin Thornton (p. 17), which is accurate. The original house and barn are still on the fairground's property. Other structures from the farm survived into the late 1940s when they were torn down. In 1886 the Iowa Legislature and the city of Des Moines appropriated funds and the first buildings were built. They were frame buildings that used boards and battens as exterior wall covering. They were mostly single-story structures that were built quickly and under a tight budget. Because they were poorly built they were constantly in need of repair. However, the buildings lasted into the early 20th century when they began to be replaced or expanded. Pioneer Hall remains from this period. The streets within the fairgrounds followed the same basic pattern as they do today, although they were unpaved and without curbing or gutters in the early years. A street lighting system was put in about 1890 when oil lamps were added. The following year 500 electric lights were installed on the grounds. Fish & Game Pavilion The new buildings built in the early 20th-century were steel frame structures covered in red brick. They included a new Livestock Pavilion that was built in 1902, Agriculture Building (1904), Administration Building (1908). A new race track and grandstand were built in 1909 and the Varied Industries Building was built in 1911. Some of the frame buildings from 1886 were moved to a different location and continued to be used. A sewer system was added at this time. The streets remained unpaved, but curbing had been added. They were also oiled to control the dust and cinders were spread to improve their durability. A park triangle had been established at the intersection of Grand and Rock Island Avenues by 1920. By 1942 when the United States Army leased the fairgrounds for a storage depot for the Air Corps there were only minimal changes to the fairgrounds. The livestock buildings had been enlarged. Running water had been installed, bath and shower houses had been built at the campgrounds and restrooms were placed throughout the fairgrounds. Street pavement began in the 1930s and both brick and concrete sidewalks were added. Storm sewers were a Works Progress Administration project in 1936. Since the end of World War II most of the buildings have been pole barn structures, although the exteriors, for the most part, are still covered in brick. Older buildings from around Iowa have been added to the fairgrounds in the 1960s and 1970s and are known as Heritage Village. Some of the buildings in the village are also those built on the fairgrounds in 1886. Fairgrounds today The Grand Concourse The fairgrounds are composed of , of which are devoted to the fair proper and about are campground.http://www.iowastatefair.org/media-center/general-information/ The grounds are organized with activities grouped into departmental areas. The livestock departments such as cattle, horses, sheep and poultry are on the south near where the railroad tracks are located. The plant departments, which includes cash crops, fruits and floral are located in the center. The amusement area with the midway and race track/grandstand is in the northeast section of the fairgrounds. The machinery department is in the west and the campgrounds are in the east. There is also a street plan based on a T-shaped road arrangement. The east/west artery is Grand Avenue, also called the Grand Concourse, and the north/south artery is Rock Island Avenue. The eastern portion of the fairgrounds is hilly while the western portion is flat. In addition to the annual state fair the fairgrounds also hosts auto shows, livestock exhibitions, flea markets, antique shows, concerts, trade shows and other events. Barns The fairgrounds have a Horse Barn, Swine Barn, Sheep Barn, and Cattle Barn. Varied Industries Building The Varied Industries Building was originally built in 1911 as the Machinery Hall. It was renamed to the Varied Industries Building in the 1930s. It was fully renovated in 2001, and named the William C. Knapp Varied Industries Building. During the fair, it displays new products and designs. The Iowa State Fair Fabric and Threads Department on the second story displays Iowa's quilts, rugs, and dolls, and hosts an annual Sew-In. Agriculture Building The Agriculture Building was originally built in 1904. The butter cow is located in this building during the fair. Heritage Village A Heritage Village section depicts Iowa life around the time of the Fair's establishment in 1854, including church hymn sings, a country school, general store, barber shop, telephone company and train depot.

Orentreich created Estee Lauder Companies' Clinique line of skin care products, invented a number of dermatologic procedures and was the first president of the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery. He is the founder of the Orentreich Medical Group and the Orentreich Foundation for the Advancement of Science, and the co-director of the latter organization. Hair transplantation The New York Academy of Medicine cited Orentreich's early research, as a young man, as being critical to later developments in hair transplantation: > While at NYU‚Äôs Skin and Cancer hospital, Norman focused his clinical > research on patients with hair loss, making use of small scalp skin grafts > to better understand the pathophysiology of these diverse conditions. This > led to the establishment of the theory of donor and recipient dominance, > making it surgically possible to transplant healthy ‚Äúandrogen insensitive‚Äù > hair from the back of the scalp to the ‚Äúandrogen sensitive‚Äù bald areas in > the front where it would take and grow permanently. In 1952, Orentreich, having graduated from New York University School of Medicine in 1948, performed the first modern, and successful, hair transplants in his office in New York. By 1961, Orentreich had performed transplants on approximately 200 patients. By 1966, approximately 10,000 men over the world had undergone the treatment invented by Orentreich. According to the textbook Hair Transplantation, edited by Walter P. Unger, M.D. and Ronald Shapiro, M.D.: > As at one time all roads led to Rome, no discussion of the origins of hair > transplantation, as a treatment for MPB (Male Pattern Baldness) or of any of > the men who first practiced this technique can begin without homage to this > extraordinary clinician and scientist who gladly -- and from the beginning > -- shared his knowledge with colleagues all over the world... The true > \\"fathers\\" of hair restoration for MPB (male pattern baldness) all emerged as > a result of collaboration or friendship with Dr. Orentreich. In the process of performing hair transplants, Orentreich discovered that \\"hair maintained the characteristics of the area from which it comes (the hair-bearing donor area), rather than to the area in which it is transplanted (the bald recipient area),\\" he coined this principle donor dominance. Clinique In 1968, Orentreich cowrote an article in Vogue with Carol Philips titled Can Great Skin Be Created?https://www.clinique.com.au/thewink/eye-on-carol-phillips In August of that year, Clinique was launched. Clinique's promotional materials highlight Orentreich's influence on the brand's ethos: > Dr Norman Orentreich holds that human skin is intuitively capable of > renewing itself, although this capability weakens with the passage of age > and environmental conditions. He believes that great skin can be created if > the secrets of the natural skin development are unlocked. > This is reflected in the success of Clinique's custom-fit 3-Step Skin Care > System, which entails taking three minutes of your time, twice a day, to > cleanse with Facial Soap, exfoliate with Clarifying Lotion and moisturise > with Dramatically Different Moisturising Lotion. All three steps are > intricately linked to promote the self-renewing capability of your skin and > to make your skin radiate at all times as it should be. Today, Clinique is the crown jewel of the Estee Lauder brand. The New York Times reported in March 2011, \\"Last year, Clinique was the best-selling skin- care brand in United States department stores, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm that tracks such sales; the Est√©e Lauder brand came in second.\\" Two of Orentreich's children, Dr. David Orentreich and Dr. Catherine Orentreich, work with Clinique as the brand's \\"Guiding Dermatologists\\". The Orentreich Foundation for the Advancement of Science In 1961, Orentreich founded the Orentreich Foundation for the Advancement of Science (OFAS), a biomedical research organization. OFAS has done work on aging, cancer and dermatology. Beginning in 1964, a group of members of the Kaiser Permanente integrated care delivery system in the northern California region participated in a program conducted by Kaiser Permanente that involved broad-spectrum physical examinations, including blood testing. Kaiser Permanente continued to maintain a portion of the blood serum specimens for use in future health research. Starting in 1980 and continuing until 2012, OFAS contributed the resources and services that were required to retain and maintain the KP-OFAS Serum Repository. In particular, OFAS validated the chemical integrity of the retained serum and catalogued the specimens and their coded data in a computer database so they could be retrieved efficiently and used productively in health research studies. In celebration of the bicentennial of the United States, the Orentreich foundation was called upon to study hairs belonging to President George Washington to determine the blood type of America's first president.

Born in Monto, Queensland, he studied at the University of Queensland, attaining bachelor's and master's degrees in agricultural science. After graduation, Anderson joined the Faculty of Agricultural Economics at the University of New England. At New England, he focused on research in farm management, risk, and uncertainty and received a doctor of philosophy in economics in 1970. In 1977, Anderson co-authored a book, Agricultural Decision Analysis, which has served as an influential source on risk and decision analysis for agricultural economics researchers and the agricultural industry. From 1978 to 1979, Anderson was chief research economist at the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics, the first holder of that role. In 1991, he was appointed an emeritus professor at New England and departed to a full-time position as an agricultural economist and rural development policy advisor at the World Bank in Washington D.C.. He retired from the World Bank in 2003. A prolific author and editor of papers and publications related to his field, Anderson has continued to write and consult in retirement. He was elected a fellow and/or presiding member of a number of professional agricultural, economic, and science organizations, including as a Distinguished Fellow in the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society. He was honored with a Doctor of the University by the University of New England in 2006 and Doctor of Agricultural Science by the University of Queensland in 2014. Early life and education Anderson was born at Monto, Queensland, to parents Robert William and Nellie Frances Anderson on 23 January 1941.Marquis Who's Who As a child he lived on and helped tend his family's beef, pig, wheat, and sorghum farm, called \\"Clifton Hills,\\" in the Upper Burnett area of Queensland. Due to an absence of high schools in his rural area, for his postprimary education Anderson traveled to Brisbane to attend Brisbane Grammar School. He graduated in 1958 and was awarded an open scholarship to the University of Queensland.Anderson, J. R., \\"2003\\"; University of New England, \\"Staff\\"; American Journal of Agricultural Economics (AJAE), \\"1996 Fellow\\" At the University of Queensland, Anderson majored in agricultural economics, with a focus in applied production. He received a Bachelor of Agricultural Science with First Class Honors in 1963. Continuing with postgraduate studies at the University of Queensland, Anderson received a Master of Agricultural Science in 1965.Anderson, J. R., \\"2003\\"; University of New England, \\"Staff\\"; AJAE, \\"1996 Fellow\\" While working towards his masters, he was selected and worked as a research fellow for the university's department of agriculture, sponsored by Sir Edmund Marsden Tooth. At the same time, he served as a science tutor at the university's Emmanuel College campus.University of New England, \\"Staff\\" Career=University of New England After receiving his master's degree, Anderson was employed as a research agronomist and applied production economist for ACF & Shirleys Fertilizers Ltd in Brisbane.University of New England, \\"Staff\\"; AJAE, \\"1996 Fellow\\" He departed Brisbane one year later, in 1966, to join the faculty of the University of New England at its campus in Armidale, New South Wales. Anderson served as a research fellow under John L. Dillon, Foundation Chair of Farm Management, studying the pastoral-zone wool industry of Queensland and New South Wales. The two particularly focused on risk management, biometric, and econometric issues related to farm management. Under Dillon's guidance, Anderson received a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Economics in 1970.Anderson, J. R., \\"2003\\"; AJAE, \\"1996 Fellow\\"; Ryan, p. 157 Anderson afterward became a lecturer in farm economic statistics until 1972, before becoming a senior lecturer between 1973 and 1974. In 1975 he was appointed as an associate professor, and in 1984 became a full-time professor (personal chair) in agricultural economics and business management, a position he held until 1991.Anderson, J.

HD-Rosetta does not require any specific software or operating systems to read the information: the information engraved onto the HD-Rosetta disc is easily accessed with a microscope.  Writing process  To record information on HD-Rosetta, special formatting and tools must be used during the writing process. First, information is converted to digital format, or Norsam Technologies receives information in digital format. Digital format is required so the information could be written in micrometers, pixel by pixel, with the focused ion beam.

For more than 196,000 pages, a scanning electron microscope would be utilized. For between 5,000 and 180,000 pages, an optical microscope would be used. To locate information rapidly, Norsam Technologies has developed a special HD-Rosetta reader to locate x,y,z coordinates. By typing a page number, the HD-Rosetta reader can locate the appropriate information and display it on a screen.  History  HD-Rosetta was first developed in the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The purpose was to develop a permanent data storage disc that would withstand nuclear war. Primarily focusing on archiving information, HD-Rosetta is thought as a method for preserving history. In 1999, The New York Times used HD-Rosetta for their \\"Times Capsule\\". Their HD-Rosetta disk contains six New York Times Millennium issues. The disk, along with acid-free archival paper, was put in a container filled with argon gas. Hoping to increase longevity of the disk and capsule, the subcontainer was suspended in thermal-gel insulation. The Times Capsule, along with a HD-Rosetta disc, currently resides in the American Museum of Natural History.\\"Design is Selected for Times Capsule\\". New York Times. December 2, 1999.

Advantages  HD-Rosetta advantages include: * Sustainability: Since HD-Rosetta is made of nickel, it will never be affected by electromagnetic radiation. * Durability: HD-Rosetta can withstand temperatures of up to 500 ¬∞C, and can last at least 1,000 years. * Withstands technical obsolescence: HD-Rosetta does not require any specific software or operating systems to read. If data is written in analog format, data can be easily translated. * Minimal processing time: It takes one-tenth of a second to etch a page onto HD-Rosetta. And in 2 hours, Norsam's automated machines can etch about 7,000 pages onto the disc. * Images: With the use of a focused ion beam, images and characters can be written by varying the time each pixel is milled for. * Size: For a small size, it can store large amounts of data.  Disadvantages  HD-Rosetta disadvantages include: * Limited accessibility: For high data densities, a scanning electron microscope would be required. * Size: HD-Rosetta can easily be lost. * Inconvenient: A focused ion beam is required to write data and a scanning electron microscope is required to read high density data.

Completed in 1938, it is the city's finest example of Art Deco architecture, and was headquarters to the Southern New England Telephone Company (SNET), which oversaw the building of the state's telephone networks. Designed by Douglas Orr and Roy W. Foote, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history The Eli is located at the junction of Church and Wall Streets in downtown New Haven, one block north of the New Haven Green in the city's commercial business district. It has seventeen stories, and is built out of a steel frame whose exterior is clad mainly in Indiana granite. A low pink granite wall delineates the property line on Church Street. It rises as a rectangular monolith for thirteen floors, with the upper stories stepped back in stages. The two street-facing facades have two-story entrance pavilions that project. The Art Deco styling includes designs and depictions related to communications, including Classical style human figures wielding lightning bolts. The interior lobby area, also two stories in height, continues these themes, and is richly finished in a variety of materials. The former headquarters of the Southern New England Telephone Company (SNET), the Art Deco building was completed in 1938, and was the tallest building in the city until 1966 (it is currently the tenth-tallest building in New Haven's skyline). Some 1,200 SNET employees worked in the office building after its completion. The company was one of New Haven's largest employers, and was responsible for the growth of the telephone system in the entire state.

The attack was regarded as part of a then \\"emerging trend\\" of attacks on Israelis by members of the Palestinian Authority security services. Context Peter Lerner, spokesman for the Israeli military in the West Bank said that it was \\"extraordinary that a Palestinian policeman would carry out such an attack.\\" The attack took place in an area controlled by Israeli police, not in an area where the Palestinian police had authority. It is one of a number of attacks and thwarted Arab terrorist attacks that have taken place at Tapuach Junction, located south of Nablus. This incident together with the Killing of Rabbi Meir Hai a month earlier, in which Palestinian police were implicated, raised concerns that Palestinian Authority police might use their weapons to attack Israeli soldiers, Israeli civilians, or both. According to Isabel Kershner, this attack took place at a \\"delicate time\\" when Israeli and Palestinian security services were attempting to built \\"mutual trust.\\" The Boston Globe called this attack unusual since although violent attacks had at one time been frequent in the West Bank, they had become \\"relatively rare\\" since Palestinian Police had taken increased responsibility for security. However, an unnamed Israeli official told the press that Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad was \\"actively encouraging Palestinians to use popular resistance against Israel.\\" Israeli columnist Caroline Glick argues that this attack was the result of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas's ongoing \\"incitement against Israel,\\" rhetoric that \\"encourages his own forces to attack Israelis.\\" Writing in Haaretz, security analyst Avi Issacharoff described the attack as part of an \\"emerging trend,\\" a series of attacks on Israelis carried out by Palestinian security personnel, including the killing of Killing of Rabbi Meir Hai two months earlier, caused by incitement to terrorism by members of the Palestinian Authority government.

The attack Ihab Khatib, a Druze Israeli policeman, was on his way from Jenin to a military outpost near Tapuah Junction, and was sitting alone in his jeep with the window open, waiting at a traffic light. Hatib, wearing civilian clothes, approached, pulled out a knife, reached through the window and thrust the knife into Khatib, who tried to escape by pressing down on the gas pedal, but his jeep flipped over on the side of the road when he lost consciousness. He died en route to the hospital and was buried the following day in his home village. Meanwhile, Hatib tried to flee by car, but Yossi Margalit, a security officer for the Rechelim settlement who was nearby, rammed his own car into him, causing light wounds. Hatib was arrested by Israeli soldiers and given medical attention. He was then transferred to the Shin Bet for questioning.PA Policeman Kills IDF Soldier, CBN.com, 11 February 2010.

Response Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad issued a \\"rare\\" condemnation of the attack, stating that it \\"conflicts with our national interests\\", and pledged to take steps to prevent such incidents in the future. However, an Israeli government source said that while the Palestinian Authority had made marked improvements in its security apparatus, it was more hesitant in dealing with extremists in its own movement. Director-General of the Palestinian Authority Minister of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs, Osama al-Ghoul, demanded that the attacker, Mahmoud Yusef Nimer Hatib, be released from custody in an Israeli hospital, saying, \\"Of course [he should be released].

Although the Mechanicsburg Methodist Episcopal Church's membership was small in the earliest years, it grew rapidly as a result of numerous revival meetings, which saw many people converted to Christianity under the preaching of men such as pioneer bishop Francis Asbury. Between 1814 and 1839, they occupied three small church buildings in Mechanicsburg, and growth prompted them to erect a larger brick structure in 1858; they chose a lot that had been used as the village's first cemetery until another cemetery was opened and the bodies were moved to the new location. As the membership approached four hundred by the late 1870s, a thorough renovation project was completed. Nevertheless, growth continued, and an even larger church building was constructed in 1904 several blocks north of the previous one. Accordingly, the congregation sold the old brick edifice to the Second Baptist Church for $2,850, which continued to improve the structure; in 1917, a local author stated that \\"It is nicely decorated on the interior and is fitted with electric lights.\\" Historically, the church boasted a peaked belfry above its entrance. This structure was cut down in 1936 following a fire at the Culbertson Buggy Works, next door to the church, which was catastrophic enough that the tower was damaged. The church's original bell was removed as a result of the fire and placed in the village school, although in return the smaller school bell was given to the church.

The churches are typical of Mechanicsburg's built environment; most of the village's historic structures are Gothic Revival, Italianate, or Queen Anne structures from the late nineteenth century, and the only extant significant examples of the pure Greek Revival style are Lawler's Tavern (1830) and Second Baptist Church.Recchie, Nancy.

Like all four of the others, the Second Baptist Church qualified for inclusion on the Register because of its historically significant architecture, and it also was deemed important because of the place that it had played in Ohio's history. Its historic status was further recognized in 2005, when the Ohio Historical Society placed a historical marker for the church along Main Street.

In the earliest years, members worshipped in each other's homes, as finances were insufficient to build a house of worship. Once the church was strong enough to erect a building, they built a small log structure. Growth soon caused this church to become too small for the number of worshippers; it was destroyed in 1844 and a larger brick church erected in its place by the members of the congregation. In turn, this church also became too small, and the members began to build a replacement in 1866. Among the church's leading ministers have been Jerry Thompson and Benjamin W. Arnett.

Established in the 1880s to serve southeastern Springfield's growing Catholic population, it uses a tall Romanesque Revival church building, which was designed by a leading city architect; the building has been named a historic site. Early years As late as 1830, not a single Catholic was resident in Clark County, but twenty Catholic families moved to Springfield between 1835 and 1845, and by 1850 there were approximately seventy Catholic families in the city.Rockel, William M., ed. 20th Century History of Springfield, and Clark County, Ohio and Representative Citizens.

By the 1880s, large numbers of Catholics were living on Springfield's southeastern side, and preparations for a separate parish began with the purchase of three lots of land in 1881. A parish school building was begun in 1882, and the new Church of St. Joseph was created a separate parish in the same year. By late 1883, the school was open, and C.M. Berding was appointed the first parish priest on New Year's Day 1884. During his ministry, construction began on the present building in 1892; extensive debt was taken on, but the work of Berding and his two successors saw the building raised to architectural grandeur and the debt reduced to nearly nothing. By 1908, the parish comprised four hundred member families, and the school enrolled approximately four hundred and fifty children.

As the years passed, the two churches began to gain members in the northern neighborhoods, and the Dayton Presbytery organized these members as Third Presbyterian Church on May 11, 1891. With over one hundred charter members, the congregation soon began planning to erect their own house of worship; under the leadership of the Russell Brothers firm, construction took place during the last quarter of 1893, and the new building was dedicated on January 28, 1894.

Accessed 2010-12-01. Distinguishing it from all of Springfield's other churches is its unusual clerestory and its unique octagonal onion dome. Among the most unusual elements of the dome is its hidden means of structural support: because no columns are present in the building's interior upon which the dome can rest, it is apparent that the dome's weight rests upon a collection of arches, which work together to distribute the dome's weight. Architectural historians have understood the shape and support of Third Presbyterian's dome as an indication that it was patterned after the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. It cannot be compared with domes in any other Cregar-designed buildings, for Third Presbyterian was the only building that he designed with a dome. Throughout the church's history, its exterior appearance has remained the same; no significant changes have ever been made to it. Recognition In 1980, Third Presbyterian Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places; it is one of four Springfield churches on the Register, along with St. Raphael's Catholic Church, St. Joseph's Catholic Church, and St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church, all of which were also designed by Cregar. It qualified for inclusion on the Register due to its historically significant architecture, which was deemed to be significant throughout Ohio; seen as the leading part of its architecture and thus of its historic significance was its unique octagonal onion dome.

It is endemic to Kangaroo Island in South Australia. First published as a variety of A. sericeus in 1870, it was promoted to species rank in 1978. Description Adenanthos macropodianus has an erect habit, usually growing to 1 metre (3 ft) in height although plants as high as 3 metres (10 ft) have been recorded. The leaves, which are up to 15 mm (0.6 in) long, are silvery, and deeply lobed into nine or more soft, hairy laciniae about half a millimetre in diameter. The flowers, which appear throughout the year, have a pink to red (or rarely yellow) perianth and a style up to 30 mm long. Taxonomy Early botanical collectors of this taxon include Ferdinand von Mueller and Frederick George Waterhouse. Mueller regarded it as a distinct species, provisionally labelling it A. barbata in his herbarium, but publication fell to George Bentham, who regarded it as merely a variety of A. sericea (now A. sericeus). In 1870. Bentham published it as A. sericea var. brevifolia, in Volume 5 of his landmark Flora Australiensis. He divided the genus into two sections, placing this taxon in A. sect. Stenolaema because its perianth tube is straight and not swollen above the middle. This division of the genus is still accepted today, though A. sect. Stenolaema is now renamed to the autonym A. sect. Adenanthos. Early in the 1970s, Ernest Charles Nelson began investigating the question of why there are so many plant species with disjunct distribution patterns in southern Australia. One such species was A. sericea, the Kangaroo Island variety of which occurred about 2500 km (1600 mi) east of the nearest population of the Western Australian variety. This led Nelson to undertake a full taxonomic revision of Adenanthos, in the course of which he concluded that A. sericea var. brevifolia warranted species rank, primarily because leaves are much smaller and have fewer laciniae than the Western Australian A. sericea. In 1978 he published a new description of the taxon, giving it species rank with the name Adenanthos macropodiana, and synonymizing A. sericea var. brevifolia with it. The specific epithet macropodiana is a reference to Macropus, the genus to which all terrestrial kangaroos belong, referring to the fact that it is only found on Kangaroo Island. Nelson refined Bentham's arrangement by dividing A. sect. Adenanthos into two subsections, with A. macropodiana placed into A. subsect. Adenanthos for reasons including the length of its perianth. However he discarded his own subsections in his 1995 treatment of Adenanthos for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. By this time, the ICBN had issued a ruling that all genera ending in -anthos must be treated as having masculine gender; thus the specific epithet became macropodianus. The placement of A. macropodianus in Nelson's arrangement of Adenanthos may be summarised as follows: :Adenanthos ::A. sect. Eurylaema (4 species) ::A. sect. Adenanthos :::A. drummondii :::A. dobagii :::A. apiculatus :::A. linearis :::A. pungens (2 subspecies) :::A. gracilipes :::A. venosus :::A. dobsonii :::A. glabrescens (2 subspecies) :::A. ellipticus :::A. cuneatus :::A. stictus :::A. ileticos :::A. forrestii :::A. eyrei :::A. cacomorphus :::A. flavidiflorus :::A. argyreus :::A. macropodianus :::A. terminalis :::A. sericeus (2 subspecies) :::A. √ó cunninghamii :::A. oreophilus :::A. cygnorum (2 subspecies) :::A. meisneri :::A. velutinus :::A. filifolius :::A. labillardierei :::A. acanthophyllus Hybrids with A. terminalis, the only other Adenanthos species that occurs on Kangaroo Island, have been reported. Distribution and habitat This species is endemic to Kangaroo Island, South Australia, making it one of only two Adenanthos species to occur outside Western Australia. It grows on sandy siliceous soils, often amongst tall scrub. Plants often found growing in association with it include Eucalyptus species, Banksia ornata and Banksia marginata. It is said to be especially common in Flinders Chase. Cultivation In 1988 the species was not known in cultivation, though there was speculation that its tolerance of salt spray may render it useful for coastal gardens. Currently, the Wittunga Botanic Garden and Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne, Australia have a number of plants in cultivation.

The ship was named after Martin Van Buren, the eighth president of the U.S. The ship was commissioned and set sail on 2 December 1839, and served a regular tour of duty with the Revenue Service. During the Second Seminole War, the ship was transferred to the United States Navy, and served as a support ship to troops along the coasts of Florida's rivers. After being transferred back to the control of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Van Buren began to sail out of its homeport of Charleston, South Carolina. Still under the command of the Revenue Cutter Service, the ship participated in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, first in the Gulf of Mexico, and later as a member of a squadron under the command of Captain John A. Webster. With the squadron, the Van Buren aided in a blockade off the coast of Veracruz. On 4 October 1846, the ship's crew had the Van Buren declared unseaworthy. It was decommissioned, and then sold for $1,200 on 1 June 1847. Career=United States Revenue Cutter Service The ship's construction was approved on 26 June 1839; she was laid out in 1839 in Baltimore, Maryland, and reported fully constructed and ready for sailing on 29 November of the same year. The ship was commissioned a few days later, and entered the service of the Revenue Cutter Service on 2 December 1839. The ship performed the regular duties of ships in the Revenue Cutter Service between 1839 and 1840, but few records exist about its specific activities during this period. The commander of the vessel during at this time was First Lieutenant John McGowan of the United States Revenue Marines. Second Seminole War When the Second Seminole War began in 1835, the Secretary of the Navy Mahlon Dickerson wrote Thomas Ewing, the United States Secretary of the Treasury at the time for command over a number of Revenue Cutter Vessels; the Van Buren was among them. The vessel became part of the Mosquito Fleet of Lieutenant Thomas T. McLaughlin. The ship served as a river vessel, mainly supporting the United States Army forces battling the Seminole on land. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War After a year in the war, the Van Buren anchored in Norfolk, Virginia, on 23 July 1842, where it reentered the Revenue Cutter Service. It was formally transferred back on 18 August 1842. The Van Buren operated out of the port of Charleston, South Carolina for three years, undergoing repairs once at Baltimore, Maryland from May through June 1844. Following the outbreak of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1846, Robert J. Walker, Secretary of the Treasury, ordered the Van Buren to the Gulf of Mexico. Under the command of Captain Thomas C. Rudolph of the United States Revenue Marines, the vessel sailed with three months' worth of ammunition and supplies to report to the Customs Collector of the Port of New Orleans; however, on its way to the port, the lightning struck the royal mast, forcing the ship back to Charleston. On 2 June 1846, the ship set sail again. On 30 July 1846, the Van Buren set to harbor in Belize, where it joined the United States Revenue Marines squadron of Captain John A. Webster and aided in a blockade of Mexico's eastern coast. The Van Buren in particular was stationed off the coast of Veracruz. On 4 October, the Van Buren was declared unseaworthy, and ordered to New York on 11 November 1846. She was decommissioned and sold on 1 June 1847 for $1,200.

It was released in September 1960 on a double bill with The Angry Red Planet.Warren, Bill (1986). \\"Keep Watching The Skies Volume 2\\". McFarland & Co., Inc. . Page 730 It starred, and was produced by, Robert Clarke and directed by Edgar G. Ulmer. Ulmer's wife Shirley acted as a script editor while their daughter Arianne Arden appeared in the film as a Russian pilot. Plot U.S. Air Force test pilot Major Bill Allison flies the X-80 experimental aircraft to sub-orbital spaceflight successfully, though losing radio contact in flight. When Major Allison returns to the airbase it appears abandoned, old and deserted. Mystified, he sees a futuristic city on the horizon and heads toward it. The major is rendered unconscious and captured. When Allison wakes, he finds himself in a dystopian underground city known as the Citadel. Unnerved by his captors' refusal to speak with him, Allison initially reacts hostilely, but he eventually calms down and is brought to their leader, the Supreme. The Supreme explains that he and his second in command, the Captain, are the only two residents of the Citadel who are able to speak or hear. The rest of the inhabitants, including the Supreme's granddaughter Trirene, are deaf-mutes, and everyone except possibly Trirene is sterile. A telepath, Trirene reads Allison's thoughts and indicates to the Supreme that she believes him not to be a spy, as the Captain suspects. The Captain sends Allison to be imprisoned with a group of bald and violent mutants who are determined to kill everyone in the Citadel. As the mutants attack him, Allison overpowers one and demands answers. They claim to be the survivors of a \\"cosmic plague\\", and they blame the residents of the Citadel for their problems. The Captain releases Allison and explains that Trirene has convinced the Supreme that he is not an enemy. Sensing his confusion, Trirene shows him historical photographs that help explain the Citadel's history, and at his urging, leads him to the \\"scapes\\", two scientists and a Russian woman officer. After disabling surveillance devices, the scientists explain that Allison has traveled through time to the year 2024. Nuclear weapons testing damaged the Earth's atmosphere, letting through dangerous cosmic rays in 1971, resulting in the cosmic plague. Those who fled underground to the Citadel were still afflicted. Although they were not as badly afflicted as those who stayed above ground, there have been no births in twenty years. The 'scapes themselves are also accidental time travelers: Russian Captain Markova comes from 1973, and General Kruse and Professor Bourman arrived from colonies on other planets in 1994. Markova explains that the Supreme needs Allison to try to repopulate their society with Trirene's help. The scientists warn Allison not to trust the Citadel. As the Captain arrives to re-enable the security device, he in turn warns Allison not to trust the scientists. As Trirene and Allison spend more time together, they fall in love. Although initially reluctant, Allison joins the 'scapes in a plan to turn Trirene against her people so that he can return to the past and try to change history. Markova sets the mutants free to attack the residents. She then demands that she accompany Allison, not Trirene, and to 1973, not 1960. Kruse and Bourman arrive, and Kruse shoots Markova for her treachery. Then Bourman knocks out Kruse, explaining that Kruse was planning to hijack the aircraft. Bourman, however, also intends to use the X-80 to return to his own time. As Allison and Bourman struggle over Kruse's pistol, a stray bullet kills Trirene before Allison can overcome Bourman. Allison takes Trirene's body to the Supreme, who is distraught over both his granddaughter's death and the doom of his people, now that the last fertile person has died. The Supreme directs Allison toward a secret passage out, persuaded by Allison that there is always hope. Returned to his own time, Allison recounts his fantastic adventure in a recorded debriefing. As high-ranking officials visit Allison in the hospital, he is revealed to have aged drastically and is now an elderly man. Allison frantically warns them of the future events, and one of them says that they have a lot to think about. Cast * Robert Clarke as Maj.

Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields: Northwestern Fort Worth area. 2011. He obtained and used film footage of an F-102 Delta Dagger standing in for the test plane. The film's action sequences used Air Force weapons, M1 carbines and M1911A1 pistols, with the actors taking care not to fire the weapons directly at one another. The film's working title was The Last Barrier.TCM notes. Production designer Ernst Fegt√© employed a triangular motif for the futuristic sets that were filmed in the vacant showground buildings. Surplus parachutes were hung in the background to muffle echoes. Clarke chose Darlene Tompkins over several contenders for the mute and psychic Trirene, including Yvette Mimieux (who appeared in The Time Machine) and Leslie Parrish.p.174 Lisanti, Tom Drive-In Dream Girls McFarland Ulmer selected his daughter Arianne for the role of Captain Alicia Markova, whose name came from the ballerina of the same name. Ulmer choreographed the daughter's movements similar to a ballet dance as she loosened her flight suit. When giving her speech inciting the mutants to revolt in a Soviet uprising, Arianne deliberately used voice inflections similar to Laurence Olivier reciting the St. Crispin's Day Speech from Henry V.p.333 Weaver, Tom Science Fiction and Fantasy Flashbacks 2004 McFarland American International Pictures (AIP) added footage to the mutant uprising sequence from their film Journey to the Lost City. One mutant was played by the screenwriter Arthur C. Pierce. Pierce was involved in the production and worked as an assistant editor. Tompkins recalled that the actors portraying the mutants, whose makeup was created by Jack Pierce, taught her how to play cribbage on the set while in costume.Lisanti, Tom Science Fiction Confidential McFarland, p.300 Tompkins was asked to do a nude swimming scene for overseas release. She refused and swimming scenes were done by a body double. When filming her swimming in a flesh colored bathing suit, the crew used the motel swimming pool where they were staying; their night filming was disrupted by a fire that broke out at the motel. Former football player Boyd Morgan performed stunts and played the Captain of the Guard. Darrell Calker, the music chief of Walter Lantz's cartoons, composed an effective film score. AIP's James H. Nicholson was keen on releasing the film based on his teenage daughters' recommendation after screening the film. AIP partner Samuel Z. Arkoff, asked Clarke what he wanted to do with the film. Clarke said he wanted to produce several films for AIP, but Arkoff said AIP didn't use contract producers. Clarke found a similar, but newer and inexperienced film company called Pacific International Pictures (PIP) or Miller-Consolidated Pictures who were keen on working with Clarke and releasing his films. However, PIP went bankrupt and AIP was able to purchase two of Clarke's films held by PIP for no more than the laboratory costs. The films were released under the AIP banner. AIP exploited MGM's publicity for The Time Machine by releasing their film a month before MGMs. Clarke was paid only his acting salary.p.89 Weaver, Tom, Brunas, John & Michael Interviews with B Science Fiction Movie Makers 2006 McFarland American International Pictures (AIP) released the film in September, 1960 on a double bill with The Angry Red Planet It was theatrically released in some areas on a double bill with The Amazing Transparent Man, another Ulmer-directed film. Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 60% of five surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.6/10. Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader wrote, \\"Even on this despairing level of fly-by- night filmmaking, Ulmer's treatment remains resolutely personal, and the film, though visually slack, emerges as something terse, resourceful, and expressively icy.\\" J. Hoberman of The Village Voice wrote that it \\"suggests an impoverished remake of the 1924 Soviet constructivist space opera Aelita\\".

It is mainly indigenous and in some cases very hearty.  Vegetables and accompaniments  Gr√ºnkohl dish with Pinkel, Kassler and Speck The most common accompaniment is potato, which is prepared in a variety of ways, especially as Salzkartoffel or boiled potatoes. A popular vegetable, very typical of the area, is kale or Gr√ºnkohl, known regionally, especially in Bremen and Brunswick Land as Braunkohl. Asparagus (Spargel) is eaten as a great delicacy in the state of Lower Saxony. It is grown mainly around the towns and cities of Burgdorf, Nienburg, Brunswick and in the Oldenburg M√ºnsterland as well as the southern part of the L√ºneburg Heath and on the Stade Geest.  Fish dishes  Plaice, flounder, herring and mackerel are typical fish dishes served in the coastal region and the areas around the estuaries of major rivers like the Elbe, Weser, Jade and Ems. In the interior of Lower Saxony, trout or eel, e.g. at the Steinhuder Meer, are popular dishes. As in much of Northern Germany, Fischbr√∂tchen (fish sandwiches) are a popular dish.  Meat dishes  Pre- cooked sausage (Kochwurst) is very popular in the L√ºneburg Heath and the region around Bremen as well as the Schaumburg Land; local varieties include Bregenwurst, Kohlwurst, Pinkelwurst. Other meat dishes from that area include Knipp, venison and game. Two specialities from the Hanover region are the Schlachteplatte, a dish with a variety of different meats, and the Calenberger Pfannenschlag (also known as Rinderwurst). An internationally known sausage speciality is the Braunschweiger. In addition in the region of Gifhorn and Wolfsburg Pottwurst with Sauerkraut is a popular autumn fare.  Soups and stews  Soup is often eaten as a starter. Particularly popular is Hochzeitssuppe - a meat broth. On the North Sea coast there is a plant called arrowgrass (Triglochin maritimum) known as Stranddreizack or R√∂hrkohl . This grows in the salt meadows immediately next to the coast and is prepared, like Gr√ºnkohl, as a thick stew. Other country dishes along the coastal region are Steckr√ºbeneintopf and Birnen, Bohnen und Speck, both types of stew.  Puddings and cakes  For coffee breaks butter cakes (Butterkuchen), tortes or other desserts are eaten, such as Welf pudding. Buckwheat gateau is popular around the L√ºneburg Heath region.  Drinks  East Frisian tea Lower Saxony is home to many breweries, for example in Jever, Einbeck, Celle, L√ºneburg, Brunswick, Allersheim (part of Holzminden), Hanover, Wittingen, Peine and G√∂ttingen. Two of the oldest beers, which have been brewed since the Middle Ages, are Brunswick Mum (Braunschweiger Mumme) and Goslarer Gose. While most Lower Saxons prefer coffee, there is a strong tea culture in East Frisia and Friesland, with some of the highest tea consumption rates in the world. Ostfriesland, as the region is known in German, consumes about 25% of all the tea consumed in Germany. Beyond consumption, tea is essential to the identity of the region. For example, there is a tea museum in Norden and there are annual tea festivals. Tea in the region is typically drunk with Kluntjes (rock candy) and heavy cream which is not stirred. Many regional herbal liqueurs are produced in Lower Saxony, such as Heidegeist and Ratzeputz on the L√ºneburg Heath and Schierker Feuerstein and Harzer Grubenlicht in the Harz, as well as world-renowned J√§germeister.

He was executed by hanging and his body was burnt. Background By 1318, Edward II of England was increasingly unpopular in England as a result of his style of government and his defeats while fighting Robert the Bruce of Scotland.Doherty, p.61. Opposition was growing to his rule, when a young clerk in Oxford, John Deydras, also known as John of Powderham,Weir, p.117. issued claims that he was in fact the rightful heir to the throne. Deydras' claims and execution Deydras arrived at Beaumont Palace in Oxford in early 1318, and claimed it for his own. He was, he said, really the King of England, and observers noted that he closely resembled Edward, being tall and good-looking. Unlike the king, Deydras, however, was missing an ear. Deydras explained that as a baby, the royal servant charged to look after him had allowed him to be attacked by a sow while he was playing in the castle courtyard,Doherty, p.60. which had bitten off his ear. Knowing that she would have been severely punished by the King, she had replaced him with a carter's baby, who had then grown up to become Edward II, while Deydras had been given to the carter to be brought up in poverty. This explained, said Deydras, Edward's style of government and his strange dislike of martial activities - notoriously, Edward enjoyed many rustic, lower class pursuits such as ditch digging and farming. Deydras offered to fight Edward in single combat for the throne. Rumours began to spread across England. Deydras was finally arrested and brought to Edward at Northampton. Deydras insulted the king, again offered to fight him in single combat and repeated his claims about Edward's parentage, resulting in a trial for sedition. Deydras confessed during the trial to having made up his story, blaming his pet cat which he claimed was the devil in disguise, who had led him astray one day while he was walking across Christchurch Meadows. Found guilty, both he and his cat were hanged and Deydras' body burnt.Weir, p.118. Legacy Today Deydras is believed to have been mentally ill; his story is not believed to have been true. Modern historians cite the case of Deydras as an example of the growing unhappiness with Edward II's rule during the period, and the protracted case appears to have deeply affected Isabella of France, Edward's wife, who felt humiliated by the event.

The woods have several features dating back to the Bronze Age and a fine display of wild bluebells and daffodils in the Spring. The abbey kept fishponds which were fed by a small stream running down through the woods, and these are still visible today though the water level is often low. Local community group Lesnes Abbey Conservation Volunteers run practical conservation events to help manage the woodland. They are a registered environmental conservation charity run by local people. The charity was started in 1994, and works closely with Bexley Council who also provide the group with support, to protect and enhance the native wildlife and the important wildlife habitats of Lesnes Abbey Wood. Lesnes Abbey Conservation Volunteers objectives include: *To conserve and maintain for the public benefit Lesnes Abbey Wood and its local environment. *To advance public education in the principles and practices of nature conservation, and the archaeological and geological interest of Lesnes Abbey Wood and its environments.

Paktia was once a unified province with Khost and Paktika in southeast Afghanistan. The three provinces are now referred to as 'Loya Paktia', which means 'The Greater Paktia' ... and parts of Kurram and Waziristan in Pakistan. Loya Paktia is vaguely defined by a common culture and history that is connected to the local indigenous tribes that reside in the region. Particular styles of clothing, articles of clothing, turban styles, turban cloth colors, dialects of Pashto language, etc. may sometimes be associated with specific tribes indigenous to Loya Paktia and thus integrate themselves into regional culture. For instance, a Pashtun tribesman from Loy Kandahar may quickly recognize a Pashtun from Loya Paktia based upon his turban (or lungee) style and color. Likewise, a Pashtun from Loya Paktia may recognize someone from Loy Kandahar based upon his unique style of collarless kameez (shirt) with specific embroidered patterns on the front. There are many subtle and intricate cultural indicators of this type that are not recorded in any known written history but simply known and observed by the tribesmen of the various Pashtun regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Main settlements The largest city of the region is Khost, while other cities of Loya Paktia include Gardez (capital of Paktia Province), Zurmat (largest city of Paktia Province), Urgun (largest city of Paktika), and Sharana (capital of Paktika). Other main towns of Loya Paktia are Sardeh Band (Ghazni), Charkh (Logar), Tari Mangal (Kurram), Angur Ada (partly in South Waziristan), Yakubi, Tani, Dadwal, Aryob, Khandkhel, Tsamkani, Zarghun Shar, Wazakhwa, and Zerok. Demography The population mostly consists of Pashtuns from various tribes under the larger Karlani and Ghilji confederacies.

Together they form the Edithvale-Seaford Wetlands Ramsar Site. With the nearby Eastern Treatment Plant, they form the Carrum Wetlands Important Bird Area. Description The wetland group is divided into the northern Edithvale Wetland , and the southern Seaford Wetland , by the Patterson River and the Patterson Lakes housing development. They lie about 30 km south-east of Melbourne City Centre, close to the eastern shore of Port Phillip, between the coastal Nepean Highway to the west and the Frankston and Mornington Peninsula Freeways to the east, and are largely surrounded by houses and golf courses. Both wetlands are seasonal floodplain systems deriving most of their water as runoff from their local catchments, the areas of which are no more than 500 ha each. They are mainly freshwater wetlands underlain by peat beds that limit the entry of saline groundwater. They are essential components of the regional drainage system in receiving, retaining and naturally treating stormwater and other surface runoff, thus protecting surrounding areas from flooding as well as helping to protect the water quality of Port Phillip.Information Sheet on Ramsar Wetlands. Hydrological management of the wetlands is aimed at enhancing their natural values and controlling the ingress of saline groundwater. History Before European settlement of the area around Port Phillip in the mid-19th century, the historic Carrum Carrum Swamp stretched from what is now Mordialloc in the north to Frankston in the south. The 4000 ha swamp's freshwater and brackish wetlands supported many animals and plants, including brolgas and magpie geese which are now locally extinct. During the second half of the 19th century the swamp was progressively drained for farming. In 1879 the Patterson River, an artificial waterway, was cut through the swamp to the coast as part of the drainage program. The remaining wetland areas were retained to provide critical flood protection. They are the largest natural wetlands of their type left in the catchments of Port Phillip and Western Port. Ramsar listing Australasian bittern Sharp-tailed sandpiper Eastern grey kangaroo The wetlands were listed on 29 August 2001 under the Ramsar Convention, as Ramsar site 1096, Australia's 11th site, in recognition of their international importance, and specifically because they: * are the last remaining examples of the Carrum Carrum Swamp, containing a variety of permanent and seasonal, freshwater and saline wetlands, * support populations of the Australasian bittern, considered to be of state significance and threatened in Victoria, and * support more than 1% of the East Asian ‚Äì Australasian Flyway population of sharp-tailed sandpipers (or over 2000 birds) in up to one year in three. They are also considered to be of exceptional significance as examples of cost-effective management of wetlands in an urban setting to provide conservation benefits, manage storm water, and encourage environmental education and research.Annotated Ramsar List. Flora and fauna=Plants The wetlands contain 14 ecological vegetation types. Three of state significance are plains sedgey wetland, tall marsh dominated by common reeds, and brackish aquatic herbland. There are several regionally significant populations of plant species, such as southern water-ribbons, only previously known in the state from western Victoria; as well as one of state significance ‚Äì the large river buttercup. A dryland vegetation association present, though degraded by invasive weeds, is river red gum dune woodland, a community that has not been recorded elsewhere in Victoria and is of high conservation significance. Animals At any one time, up to 7000 individual birds make the Edithvale- Seaford Wetlands their home. Some 190 species have been recorded, including many migratory waders. Species listed as protected under Victoria's Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 are the great egret, Australasian bittern, Baillon's crake, Lewin's rail and the white-bellied sea eagle. There is also a population of eastern grey kangaroos. Access The Edithvale Wetland is managed by Melbourne Water, while the Seaford Wetland is jointly managed by Melbourne Water and the City of Frankston. Public amenities include a bird hide (blind) at the Edithvale Wetland with education displays, as well as walking and bicycle tracks around both wetlands for birdwatching.Case Study - Edithvale-Seaford Wetlands The bird hide is accessible from Edithvale Road, staffed by volunteers from the Friends of Edithvale-Seaford Wetlands, and open from 1300 to 1700 on Sundays. The hide was closed in early 2010 due to structural problems. It reopened in August 2016.

Cdc4 targets primarily cell cycle regulators for proteolysis. It serves the function of an adaptor that brings target molecules to the core SCF complex. Cdc4 was originally identified in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. CDC4 gene function is required at G1/S and G2/M transitions during mitosis and at various stages during meiosis.  Homologues  The human homologue of the cdc4 gene is called FBXW7. The corresponding gene product is the F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7. In the nematode C. elegans, the homologue to Cdc4 is F-box/WD repeat-containing protein sel-10.  Some general features  Cdc4 has a molecular weight of 86'089Da, an isoelectric point of 7.14, and consists of 779 amino acids. It resides exclusively in the nucleus because of a single monopartite nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) comprising amino acids 82-85 in the N-terminal domain.  Structure  Cdc4 is one component of the E3 complex SCF (CDC4), which comprises CDC53, SKP1, RBX1, and CDC4. Its 779 amino acids (in S. cerevisiae) are arranged into one F-box domain (approximately 40 amino acids (\\"F-box\\" motif)) and 7 WD repeats.http://www.abcam.com/Cdc4-Fbw7-hSel-10-peptide-ab12311.html Cdc4 is a WD-40 repeat F-box protein. Like all members of this family, it contains a conserved dimerization motif called D domain. In yeast Cdc4, the D domain protomers arrange in a superhelical homodimeric manner. SCF (Cdc4) dimerization hardly affects the affinity for target molecules, but significantly increases ubiquitin conjugation. Cdc4 adapts a suprafacial configuration: The substrate-binding sites lie in the same plane AS the catalytic sites, with a separation of 64√Ö within and 102√Ö between each SCF monomer. In Cdc4, the substrate binding domain is built on WD40 domains, which use repeats of 40 amino acids), each forming four anti-parallel beta-strands, to assemble the blades of a so-called beta-propeller. Beta-propellers are a quite frequent form of adaptable surface for interaction between different proteins. This substrate interaction region is located C-terminally. There are three isoforms of Cdc4 in mammals: Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥. These are produced via alternative splicing of 3 unique 5‚Äô exons to 10 common 3‚Äô exons. This results in proteins that differ only at their N-termini. Cdc4 protein interacts with Cdc34, an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and Cdc53 in vivo. (There is a Cdc4p/Cdc53p-binding region on Cdc34p.) All three proteins are stable throughout the cell cycle.  Function  Fig. 1 The figure shows a sketch of how the SCF complex functions, and what the role of Cdc4 is within this structure (-> adaptor function). Various cellular regulatory mechanisms heavily depend on ubiquitin-dependent degradation. The SCF (Cdc4) complex has a regulatory function in cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and transcription. In order for the cell cycle to proceed, several inhibitory proteins, as well as cyclins, have to be eliminated at given time points. Cdc4 assists there by recruiting target molecules via its C-terminal substrate interaction domain (WD40 repeat domain) to the ubiquitination machinery. This causes transfer of ubiquitin molecules to the target, hence marks it for degradation. Cdc4 recognizes and binds to phosphorylated target proteins. Cdc4 can be essential, or nonessential, depending on the organism. For instance, it is essential in S. cerevisiae, while it is non-essential in C. albicans. It is essential for initiation of DNA replication and separation of spindle pole bodies, hence for the formation of the poles of the mitotic spindle. In budding yeast it is also involved in bud development, fusion of zygotic nuclei (karyogamy) after conjugation, and several aspects of sporulation. Roughly speaking, in the cell cycle Cdc4 function is required for G1/S and G2/M transition. Some important interactions in which Cdc4 is involved are: * ubiquitination of the phosphorylated form of the cell cycle kinase inhibitor (CKI) SIC1 * degradation of the CKI FAR1 in absence of pheromone; restriction of FAR1 degradation to the nucleus (since Cdc4 is exclusively nuclear) * transcription activation of the HTA1-HTB1 locus * degradation of the phosphorylated form of Cdc6  Onset of S-phase  Swi5 is a transcriptional activator of Sic1, which inhibits S-phase CDKs. Thus, Sic1 protein degradation is necessary to enter S-phase. SCF (Cdc4) complex‚Äôs regulatory function concerning S-phase entry comprises not only degradation of Sic1, but also degradation of Swi5. In order for the substrate adapter unit Cdc4 to bind to Sic1, a minimum of any six of the nine cyclin-dependent kinase sites on Sic1 have to be phosphorylated. In other words: There is a threshold number of phosphorylation sites in order to achieve receptor-ligand binding. As recently stated, this \\"suggests that the ultrasensitivity in the Sic1-Cdc4 system may be driven at least in part by cumulative electrostatic interactions\\". In general, an ultrasensitive enzyme requires less than 81-fold increase in stimulus to drive it from 10% to 90% activity. \\"Ultrasensitivity\\" highlights that the upstroke of the stimulus/response curve is steeper than the one that is obtained for a hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten enzyme. Thus, ultrasensitivity allows a highly sensitive response: A graded input can be transformed into a sharply thresholded output. The development of B-type cyclin‚Äìcyclin-dependent kinase activity, as well as the onset of DNA replication, requires degradation of Sic1 in the late G1 phase of the cell cycle. The WD domain of Cdc4 binds to the phosphorylated form of Sic1. Each bond to a Sic1-Phosphate is weak, but together the binding is strong enough to enable Sic1-degradation via the pathway described before. Hence, in this case ultrasensitivity allows precise definition (\\"fine tuning\\") of the time point in which destruction of Sic1 occurs, leading to initiation of the next step in the cell cycle (-> DNA replication).  G2/M transition  Up until now it is not satisfyingly understood how Cdc4 triggers G2-M transition. In general, the second degradation complex involved in cell cycle progression, APC, is responsible for proteolysis at that stage. However, experimental data suggests that Cdc4 function in G2/M transition may be linked to the degradation of Pds1 (anaphase inhibitor). And what is more, CDC4 and CDC20, an activator of APC, interact genetically. Cdc4 recruits several other substrates than Sic1 to the SCF core complex, including the Cln-Cdc28 inhibitor / cytoskeletal scaffold protein Far1, the transcription factor Gcn4, and the replication protein Cdc6. In addition to those functions mentioned above, Cdc4 is involved in some other degradation-dependent events in S. cerevisiae like for instance unfolded protein response.  Clinical significance  In mammals, amongst others c-Myc, Src3, Cyclin E, and the Notch intracellular domain are substrates of Cdc4. Due to its involvement in degradation of various cell cycle regulators, as well as several compounds of signaling pathways (e.g. Notch), Cdc4 is a highly sensible component of every organism in which it functions. The cdc4 gene is a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor gene. Knock-out of this gene in mice leads to an embryonic lethal phenotype. CDC4 mutations occur in a number of cancer types. They are described best in colorectal tumors, and also have been found to be a mutational target in pancreatic cancer. E3 has an additional function to its primary role in the degradation of certain cell cycle regulators: It is also involved in formation of the neural crest. Hence, Cdc4 is a protein \\"with separable but complementary functions in control of cell proliferation and differentiation\\". This evokes the assumption -beyond regulating cell cycle progression- Cdc4 as a tumor suppressor protein may extend its ability to directly regulate tissue differentiation. However, its concrete role in diseases is still to be elucidated.

One third of the council was up for election and the Conservative party gained overall control of the council from no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 27 *Liberal Democrat 22 *Independent 3 *Labour 1 Campaign Before the election the Conservatives were one seats short of having a majority on the council with 26 seats, as compared to 22 for the Liberal Democrats, 2 Labour and 3 independents. 16 seats were contested in the election with the Liberal Democrats defending the most seats. Council tax levels were the major issue in the election with the Liberal Democrats attacking plans for a 58% increase, which they said was mostly due to waste and poor decisions by the council. However the Conservatives defended the rise, blaming it on an insufficient grant from the national government and on the previous Liberal Democrat administration for using cash balances to keep levels artificially low. The election also saw four independent candidates standing in Stratford wards in opposition to the council tax rise. Election result The results saw the Conservatives regain control of the council, after the election saw 5 seats changes hands. They made a net gain of 1 seat at the expense of Labour who were reduced to only 1 seat on the council after losing in Southam ward. The election in Stratford Avenue and New Town saw the closest result with independent Keith Lloyd, standing in protest at council tax levels, defeating Liberal Democrat Bill Lowe by 1 vote. However the Liberal Democrats ended with the same number of seats, with their 2 gains including a surprise win in Stockton and Napton. Turnout in the election varied from a low of 27% to a high of 51%, but overall fell from 45% in 2002 to only 35%. This was despite including 3,000 voters who had used a trial e-voting internet system.

The word Alc√°ntara comes from Arabic ÿßŸÑŸÇŸÜÿ∑ÿ±ÿ© (al-qan≈£arah), which means \\"arch\\". Located at the foot of the Castillo de San Servando, it was built by the Romans after they founded the city. In the Middle Ages it was one of the few entrances for pilgrims into the city. It currently has two arches. There is evidence of its construction in Roman times, at the founding of Toletum. It was damaged and rebuilt in the 10th century, at which time a third arch disappeared, reduced to a gate with a horseshoe arch. It was one of the only bridges that gave access to the city and in the Middle Ages it was the obligatory entry for all pilgrims. During the reign of Alfonso X of Castile it suffered serious damage and was rebuilt. The western tower belongs to this period, later decorated under the reign of the Catholic Monarchs, whose arms decorate its walls. The fruit of the pomegranate (the emblem of Granada) is missing from them, because the Reconquista had not finished at that time. The eastern tower was replaced by a Baroque triumphal arch in 1721, because of its ruinous state. It was declared a national cultural monument in 1921. The bridge should not be confused with either the Alc√°ntara Bridge in Alc√°ntara or the Alcon√©tar Bridge in the Extremadura region, both Roman bridges are situated further downstream.

East Park is registered a Grade II listed site by English Heritage. It is the largest public park in Hull and is often used for large open-air venues such as concerts and the annual Hull Show. History East Park first opened to the public on 21 June 1887‚Äîthe day the country celebrated Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. About 20 years earlier, in the west of the city, Zachariah Pearson had established Hull's first public park, which was initially known as The People's Park and later simply as Pearson Park. Then, in 1882, with Pearson Park established in the west, the Parks Committee began to look at possible locations for a park in the east. They eventually decided on a site close to the terminus of the horse-drawn tramway which ran along Holderness Road, and they agreed to pay ¬£16,909 7s 6d to Mrs Anne Watston's Trust for 38 acres 2 roods and 24 perches of her land (approx. 15 ha). An insight into how East Park's Victorian founders came to choose its site, and into their hopes for the role it might play within the community, is found in the accountant's report of 1883. > \\"...A more picturesque locality of that extent it would be impossible find > on the East side of the Borough or one more adapted to restore the jaded > energies of the artisan or man of business when the labours of the day are > ended.\\". The Ferens Boating Lake, East Park, in 1914 Work was soon under way to construct the city's new green space, and by 1886 the project was providing 140 much needed jobs in a time of high unemployment, with the possibility that the total figure might climb as high as 200. Most of the men were earning up to 18s a week but around ten were paid a couple of shillings more. When Jubilee Day arrived the following summer, large crowds lined the route of a parade which marched from the city centre, where a new covered market was officially opened, along Lowgate, Whitefriargate, and Holderness Road to its end point in the new park. There is no record of any official decision to adopt the name East Park, and at the opening ceremony Alderman W.F.Chapman suggested that it should be called Victoria Park. However, East Park it remained, and as local historian Mary Fowler remarks \\"...with the economy of expression so common in these parts, East Park is, as often as not, just 'Park' to the people of East Hull.\\". From the beginning East Park and its counterpart in the west were focal points for many kinds of recreational activity. East Park did not offer the archery and quoits available in Pearson Park, but football, cricket, tennis and bowls were popular. The Model Yacht Pond had its own Yacht House and a flagpole for team colours. Enthusiasts could read about competitions involving the tiny craft in the local newspaper: an edition in June 1912, for example, revealed that the boats had to contend with \\"a light northerly breeze, the course being a beat to windward.\\". Concerts in both parks drew large audiences: a performance in Pearson Park, one Friday evening in July 1901, entertained 15,000 spectators. Views of East Park. Video The popularity of East Park kept the authorities busy. When The Shop Assistants Union complained that its late-working members were unable to attend the concerts, and so \\"girls of 13 and 14 years never have a chance to hear the music\\", they found a champion in Hull Daily Mail columnist \\"Mother Humber\\", who wanted the concerts moved to Thursday, which was early-closing day. Footballers' poor behaviour and swearing were cause for concern for the Parks Superintendent, but the cricketers and the model-boaters appear to have escaped his disapprobation. Bowls, like tennis, required careful handling when assessing the competing claims of the general public and organised teams, all of whom wanted access to the facilities during the few short hours \\"when the labours of the day are ended\\". Before 1930 the park gradually expanded eastwards to occupy a triangular area of land more or less equivalent with its present-day boundaries. The new land, bounded on the north by the Summergangs Dyke and Holderness Road on the south, took in the George V Playing Fields and a series of old clay pits. Surviving park features from the era include the Ferens boating lake which was established on land donated by T.R. Ferens in 1913 and extended in 1923, a double arched bridge with decorative balustrades built around 1925 and a rare 1929 Wicksteed water chute which is Grade II listed. A ¬£10.3 million refurbishment on site has returned the East Park recreational area to its former condition. New visitor attractions include a giant walk-through aviary, an animal education centre, a boat house and a community pavilion. The Victorian Khyber Pass, Wicksteed Splash boat, original maze and the Valley Ornamental Gardens have been restored. In addition, special help points have been installed so that visitors can call for a park ranger or first aid. The Heritage Lottery Fund contributed ¬£6.4 million to the refurbishment project, which was completed in 2008. The Grade II listed Splash Boat underwent a ¬£35,000 restoration in 2012 and reopened on 2 June. In late 2015 planning permission was sought and granted by the council to extend the car park of the adjacent Woodford Leisure Centre into the park removing a large amount of green space. This was despite the objections of residents and of some council departments notably those responsible for wildlife and green spaces. A new memorial to Mick Ronson was unveiled on 2 June 2017 in the park.

The Castle of San Servando is a medieval castle in Toledo, Spain, near the Tagus River. It was begun as a monastery, occupied first by monks and later by the Knights Templar. In 1874 the castle was named a national monument. The fortress was depicted in El Greco's painting View of Toledo. Lying at the opposite bank of the Tagus than the main urban core, it is connected to the Santa B√°rbara residential area through the Cuesta de San Servando. Monastery=Benedictines Evidence exists of an ancient monastery attached to a basilica of the same name, possibly founded in the 7th century. In 1080, Cardinal Richard of St. Victor, a monk of the ancient Abbey of St. Victor in Marseille, was sent as the legate of Pope Gregory VII to the Council of Burgos held that year. One of his mandates was to ensure the adoption of the Roman Rite, replacing the ancient Mozarabic Rite used by the Christians of Iberia for centuries. He carried specific instructions for the restoration of San Servando and its adoption of Roman liturgical practice. After surviving for several centuries under Muslim rule, when the city was conquered by the Christian army of King Alfonso VI of Castile in 1085, both he and his wife, Constance of Burgundy, became generous benefactors of the basilica and rebuilt the monastery. According to John Ormsby, the English translator of Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, Alfonso VI called the castle \\"San Servando\\" after a Spanish martyr, a name subsequently modified into San Servan (in which form it appears in the \\"Poem of the Cid\\"), San Servantes, and San Cervantes. Mr. Ormsby mentions that \\"there is a complete history of the Cervantes family from the tenth century down to the seventeenth extant under the title \\"Illustrious Ancestry, Glorious Deeds, and Noble Posterity of the Famous Nuino Alfonso, Alcaide of Toledo,\\" written in 1648 Rodrigo Mendez Silva.\\" On the side of the mountain, near the Castle, a poem by Miguel de Cervantes was enshrined in 2005, four hundred years after Miguel de Cervantes wrote it. A picture of the poem is at panoramio.com. On 11 March 1088, the king offered the monastery to the Holy See on the condition that it be permanently administered by the Abbey of St. Victor, along with all its goods and benefits. This arrangement was approved by Pope Urban II, who was elected the day after the documents for the donation were drawn up, on 20 February 1089. He entrusted the task to Cardinal Richard, by then himself Abbot of St. Victor. After that point, the monastery came under the authority of the Abbey of St. Victor and French monks began to occupy the Spanish monastery, introducing the Rule of St. Benedict. King Alfonso saw the monastery as a bulwark of Christian presence in the region, and on 13 February 1099, made a donation of the Church of Santa Mar√≠a de Alfic√©n, and of the community surrounding it, which was a traditional Mozarabic territory. He gave the monastery the objective of maintaining this identity among the populace. He further founded a monastery of Benedictine nuns to be attached to the church. Both monastic communities were charged with providing care and hospitality to the poor of the region and to travelers. The monastery was destroyed by Saracen attacks in 1110, and the monks returned to Marseille. It was at this point that the Monastery of San Servando entered a new phase of its existence, as it became the possession of the Archbishop of Toledo and the cathedral chapter. Knights Templar Portal King Alfonso VIII gave the monastery to the Knights Templar, who converted the monastery into a fortress in order to protect the Puente de Alc√°ntara against a possible Muslim attack. With the disappearance of the Muslim threat and the dissolution of the Templars in 1312, the fortress lost its importance and was neglected. Today tours of the castle are conducted about the alleged haunting of the site by a miscreant knight, Don Nu√±o Alvear, who supposedly died after being shown his many victims in a vision. Later use The fortress was depicted in El Greco's noted landscape work, View of Toledo. It is currently used as a youth hostel.

Based on the Tim Burton's 2010 film of the same name, it was released in the same week as the film for the Wii, Nintendo DS, Windows PC and Zeebo, with the soundtrack being composed by video game music composer Richard Jacques. The Wii, DS, and PC versions were released on March 2, 2010. The DS game is completely different from the Wii and PC versions. Gameplay Alice in Wonderland allows players to guide, protect and aid Alice as she journeys through the world of Wonderland while unraveling the game's many twisted mysteries. Along the way, players call on a diverse and unique cast of characters such as the Mad Hatter and Cheshire Cat who each have unique abilities to help evade traps and solve challenging puzzles. The Mad Hatter can help Alice alter her perception of Wonderland and take advantage of optical illusions to open up places in the world the player alone would not have noticed. Meanwhile, the Cheshire Cat can use his ability to make himself and objects appear and disappear helping Alice through this strange world. Players must choose wisely when using each of the characters' powers and combine the abilities to solve more complex puzzles. Reception The game was met with mostly positive reception upon release. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 78.82% and 78 out of 100 for the DS version; 70.50% and 69 out of 100 for the Wii version; and 63 out of 100 for the PC version. GameZone's Michael Lafferty gave the Wii version of the game a 7.5 rating out of 10, saying, \\"Graphically this game scores well, and though the overall gameplay is nothing that has not been experienced before, the game still has a nice rhythm to it. It is what it is ‚Äì a game adaptation of a movie, slightly offbeat, but accessible.\\" On the other hand, GameSpot gave the game a 6 out of 10 \\"fair\\" rating. It noted some of the game's puzzle mechanics and \\"variety\\" as good points, while repetitive combat, bad voice acting, visual unevenness, and poor multiplayer were bad points. In comparison, the DS version of the game fared well, earning an 8.5 out of 10 or \\"Great\\" rating. For the DS, GameSpot criticized the combat and the occasional experience of not knowing what to do next. However, GameSpot praised the \\"visual direction,\\" puzzles, characterization, humor, cleverness, and DSi features. DRM The PC version of the game uses the SecuROM copy-protection system; like in most SecuROM-protected games such as Grand Theft Auto IV, Mirror's Edge and Batman: Arkham Asylum, the developers implemented triggers that can impair gameplay, preventing players using an imperfectly cracked copy from completing it. Voice cast Actors who reprised their roles from the film include Mia Wasikowska (as Alice Kingsleigh), Crispin Glover (as Ilosovic Stayne, the Knave of Hearts), Michael Sheen (as Nivens McTwisp the White Rabbit), Barbara Windsor (as Mallymkun the Dormouse), Stephen Fry (as Chessur the Cheshire Cat) and Leo Bill (as Hamish Ascot). The remaining roles were taken over by alternate voice actors, including Ashley Bell, Jared Butler, Trevor Person, Eliza Schneider, David Shaughnessy, Roger Craig Smith, Dave Wittenberg and Tatyana Yassukovic, though none of the actors are credited to a specific role.

Carit Etlar, the better-known pen name of Carl Brosb√∏ll (August 7, 1816 ‚Äì May 9, 1900), was a Danish author, known mostly for his 1853 book Gj√∏ngeh√∏vdingen about the eponymous Svend Poulsen G√∏nge.

His father was a businessman, and Carl spent much time travelling through Jutland for his father. He was a talented drawer and started studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. He eventually abandoned his drawing studies, and finished a university degree in 1844. Brosb√∏ll joined the Danish army for the 1848 First Schleswig War, and was employed at the Royal Danish Library in 1853.Carit Etlar at Gyldendals √Öbne Encyklop√¶di Owing to ill health, he gave up his library work in 1885, and went travelling, especially on Corsica. He was married in 1851 to Hansine Erasmine Thorbj√∏rnsen, whom he later divorced to marry Olga Augusta Schultz in 1888. Authorship Brosb√∏ll had poems and articles published in various magazines, before making his breakthrough with the 1839 novel Smuglerens S√∏n (the Smuggler's Son) under the pen name Carit Etlar. He would use the name Carit Etlar for the rest of his professional career. He wrote as an anonymous playwright for the Royal Danish Theatre in 1844. In 1853, he published Gj√∏ngeh√∏vdingen (The Partisan Chieftain), a fictionalized account of historical figure Svend Poulsen G√∏nge's exploits during the 17th century, centering on the 1658‚Äì1660 Dano-Swedish War. Gj√∏ngeh√∏vdingen was hugely popular, and was followed up by the 1855 sequel Dronningens Vagtmester (The Queen's Bodyguard). Etlar published more than 75 short stories, books, and plays through his career, and was active until his death. Etlar's literary style was unique in Denmark, as it was highly varied and inventive. It relied on entertaining and fast-paced adventure, with effective focus on action with the main character beating improbable odds. His descriptions of Jutland, which he knew extensively from his youth, was likened to that of Steen Steensen Blicher. He had a fundamental fascination with everyday common life, writing with strong nationalistic overtones, and in his time, Etlar's popular appeal was second only to B. S. Ingemann. However, his writing was also criticized for being trivial, and for relying on variations of the same character archetypes, with his main characters most often modelled on D'Artagnan.

His business interests included Bowen and Bowen, Ltd., which was founded by his father, and is the exclusive bottler of Coca-Cola products in Belize, as well as the Belize Brewing Company, which brews Belikin beer. Bowen also served as a former member of the Senate of Belize and the financier of the People's United Party. In December 2007, Queen Elizabeth II knighted Bowen as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. Bowen was the second wealthiest citizen of Belize at the time of his death in 2010. Biography Bowen, a seventh generation Belizean, was born to Eric William Manfield Bowen and Emilie Josephine Bowen, in Belize City, British Honduras, on September 19, 1945. Eric Bowen, originally from San Ignacio, Cayo District, founded a lemonade factory called Bowen and Bowen (and also known as the Crystal Bottling Co.) in 1930s. The company would eventually grow into Belize's largest bottler under his son, Barry. Barry Bowen attended Cornell University and returned to run Bowen and Bowen with his father. They began distributing Coca-Cola products throughout what was then known as British Honduras. Barry Bowen became the manager of his father's company in 1968. In 1971, the family-owned Bowen and Bowen acquired the Belize Brewing Company, maker of Belikin, which was first brewed in the late 1960s. Businesses Bowen purchased Bowen and Bowen, Ltd., from his father in 1978. Bowen focused on developing his business into Belize's only maker and distributor of Coca-Cola products in the country. He also sought to turn Belikin, brewed by the Belize Brewing Company, into the most popular beer in Belize. Before Belikin, most Belizeans drank imported Guinness stout or Heineken. Once Bowen began producing the locally brewed Belikin in larger quantities, the People's United Party (PUP) raised taxes on imported beers, which had the effect of switching most local drinkers to the less costly Belikin. As of 2010, the Bowen family-owned brewing company controls virtually the entire beer market in Belize, as imports of brands from Mexico and Guatemala are prohibited. Belikin is now the country's only domestically produced beer, following the failure of its competitor, Charger beer. The company currently brews several brands of beer - Belikin, Lighthouse lager, Belikin Supreme lager, and Belikin stout, as well as Guinness stout under a licensing agreement. Bowen had a large number of other business interests, in addition to his Coca-Cola and Belikin operations. He owned the Gallon Jug Estate, a private nature reserve in Orange Walk District. Within Bowen's Gallon Jug Estate is the Chan Chich Lodge, a world famous Belizean rainforest hotel, and Gallon Jug Agro-Industries, a organic experimental farm which Bowen established to produce cacao and cattle. The farm is also the only commercial coffee grower in Belize. He also owned Belize Aquaculture Ltd., a shrimp farm located near the village of Placencia, Stann Creek District, and a Ford dealership in Belize City. He also served as the director of Belize Airways, established in 1976, which was the country's first national airline. Bowen was killed around 5:30 p.m. on February 26, 2010, when the Cessna 206 he was piloting crashed on approach to the airstrip at San Pedro Town, Ambergris Caye. Bowen was 64 years old. The crash also killed Michael Casey and Jill Casey, teachers at Gallon Jug Community School on Bowen's Gallon Jug Estate, and their children, Makayla and Bryce, who were from Albany, New York. Bowen was survived by his wife, Lady Dixie Summerscales, six children, and several grandchildren. Sir Barry Bowen was granted a state funeral on March 2, 2010, which was attended by Prime Minister Dean Barrow and his wife, leader of the opposition, Johnny Brice√±o, former Prime Minister Said Musa and other dignitaries. The funeral was held at St. John's Cathedral, Belize City. Bowen was buried with his parents in San Ignacio Town, Cayo District.

The tsessebes in northeastern Zambia in the southern Bangweulu Flats are classified by naturalist F. Cotterill as a new species based on differences in pelage and cranial morphology. Bangweulu tsessebe have been on a rapid decrease in population for the past 2 centuries due to competition for food and shelter.
