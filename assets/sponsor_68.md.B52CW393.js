The company's manufacturing plant was initially located in Bend and later moved to Coburg. After its initial bankruptcy, the Beaver Coach brand name was purchased by a series of parent companies before it finally disappeared in 2009. In 2016 the Beaver Brand and rights to build were purchased by Ty Kelly owner of Beaver Coach Sales and ServiceBeaver Coach Sales and Service located on the grounds of the original Beaver Factory. Their hope is to one day begin manufacturing Beaver Coaches and restore them to their former glory.  History  Beaver Motorcoach Corporation was founded in the late 1960s by Jim Hogue and Frank Storch. The company was named after the Oregon State University mascot. The firm originally built slide-in campers for pickup trucks. Sometime around 1974, the company began building Class C motor homes, commonly called \\"minis\\". The motor homes were built on a Chevrolet and Dodge chassis with either a Chevrolet 454 or Dodge 440 engine. In the mid-1970s, the company opened a motor coach repair facility in Bend. In the early 1980s, the company began building Class A motor homes with gas engines. Their product line ranged in size up to in length. During this period, all the Beaver Coach models used a brown and white color scheme. The company introduced its first diesel motor home in 1985. The following year, the company began producing coaches with a European-style rounded front end. They also introduced a new color pattern that featured red, green, and blue rainbow designs. By 1990, the company employed 225 people at its Bend assembly plant. However, a decline in sales in the latter half of that year forced the company to furlough its employees for 30 days to allow demand to catch up with production.\\"Temporary layoff hit Beaver Coach workers\\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, December 13, 1990. During the early 1990s, Beaver Coach continued to employ 250 to 300 people despite growing financial problems. By November 1993, the company's debt exceeded $11 million and it was forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. While under the court's protection, Country Coach of Junction City, Oregon offered $6.9 million for the company. At the same time, Safari Motorcoach Corporation of Harrisburg, Oregon submitted a $7.6 million bid and eventually took ownership of Beaver Coach. Under the reorganization plan, Safari took over management of Beaver Coach. As part of the plan, unsecured creditors received less than 50 cents on the dollar.Freeman, Mike, \\"Beaver bids heat up\\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, December 13, 1990.Freeman, Mike, \\"Beaver coach plan moves ahead\\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, April 3, 1994. Monaco Coach purchased Safari in 2002. The Beaver Coach brand name passed to Monaco as part of the deal. After acquiring the Beaver Coach brand rights, Monaco began producing a new line of luxury coach called the Beaver Solitaire. In 2006, Monaco moved its Beaver Coach assembly plant to Coburg, Oregon. During this period, several models that were not selling well were eliminated from the Beaver Coach product line. In 2009, Monaco filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The following year, Navistar International purchased Monaco. However, Navistar decided not to purchase the Beaver Coach brand name. No, the name passed through to Allied (REV Group). As a result, the Beaver Coach brand disappeared from the market at that time. Also at about this time two Beaver Contessas were on the production line in Coburg, after Navistar finally completed the purchase of Monaco Coach they completed these Contessas on the production line, They were labeled as the 2010 model year. The two Contessas were sent up to Canada to be sold but they did not sell there. The two Contessas ended up for sale at Beaver Coach Sales Of Bend (former lot of Beaver Coach facility), the two Contessas are no longer for sale the assumption is that the two coaches have been sold. Early in 2016 the brand name was purchased from REV Group by the owner of Beaver Coach Sales and Service in Bend, OR, returning the brand to its roots. The hope is to one day begin manufacturing Beaver Coaches and restore them to their former glory.  Beaver Ambassador Club  The Beaver Ambassador Club is an international motor home organization for owners of Beaver Coach motor homes. The club is affiliated with the Family Motor Coach Association. Each year, the organization sponsors approximately 30 rallies for its members.\\"Beaver Ambassador Club Mission Statement\\", Beaver Ambassador Club, Cincinnati, Ohio, February 17, 2014. The first club rally was held in Bend in September 1983.\\"Join BAC\\" , Beaver Ambassador Club, Cincinnati, Ohio, February 17, 2014.

T. A.

Life  He was the son of a businessman, Gustav Stumpf (1842–1914). From 1884 to 1889, he attended the König-Albert-Gymnasium in Leipzig.König Albert-Gymnasium (bis 1900 Königliches Gymnasium) in Leipzig: Schüler-Album 1880-1904/05. Friedrich Gröber, Leipzig 1905. Later he attended the art academies in Leipzig and Munich, where he specialized in landscape and portrait painting. In Munich he studied under Gabriel von Hackl, Karl Raupp, Paul Hoecker and Heinrich von Zügel. His style of painting was, therefore, highly influenced by Impressionism. From 1898 to 1899 he attended the art school at Burghausen. In 1904 he married Gertrud Salge (1877–1949), a painter from Magdeburg. They lived in Wolfratshausen at first then, from 1908 to 1910, in Regenstauf. From 1900 to 1922 he exhibited regularly at the Munich Glaspalast. In that year, he won the Silver Medal for decorative design at the Leipzig Art Exhibition. In addition to his paintings, he produced woodcuts, etchings and book illustrations. During the First World War, he served as a war correspondent and illustrator for the German campaign in the Vosges. This was not only physically stressful, but psychologically damaging as well. After the war, Stumpf and his wife moved to the Oberallgäu district, settling in Oberstaufen, where he stayed at a rehabilitation center, hoping to recuperate his strength and peace of mind. Unfortunately, the hyperinflation of the 1920s wiped out his savings and he was in little demand as an artist. As a result, he fell into a deep depression and committed suicide. In 2009, a memorial exhibition was presented in Oberstaufen, accompanied by the first comprehensive catalog of his works; a list of which can be found in the corresponding article on German Wikipedia.

Set in 1948, it tells the story of a troubled Army veteran and author who returns to his Midwestern home town after 16 years, to the chagrin of his wealthy, social-climbing brother. Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer, in a bid to duplicate the success of the multi–Academy Award winning film adaptation of Jones' earlier novel, From Here to Eternity (1953), optioned the 1,200-plus-page book Some Came Running and cast Sinatra as the lead. Sinatra approved Dean Martin for the role of Bama, in what would be their first film together. MacLaine garnered her first Oscar nomination, which she credited to Sinatra for his insistence on changing the film's ending. The film was released in CinemaScope and Metrocolor. Plot In 1948, Dave Hirsh is a cynical Army veteran who winds up in his hometown of Parkman, Indiana after being put on a bus in Chicago while intoxicated. Ginny Moorehead, a woman of seemingly loose morals and poor education, was invited by Dave in his drunken state to accompany him to Parkman. When Dave sobers up, he realizes it was a mistake, and gives her money to return to Chicago. However, she decides to stay because she has fallen in love with Dave and is also trying to avoid a violent boyfriend in Chicago. Dave left 16 years before and had a career as a writer before the war, publishing two books. He did not stay in touch with his older brother, Frank, because of how Frank and his wife Agnes treated him when he was a child. Frank, who was newly married to the well-off Agnes, had placed Dave in a charity boarding school rather than take him to live in his home. Frank has since inherited a jewelry business from Agnes' father, sits on the board of a local bank, and is active in civic affairs. Frank and Agnes are very concerned about their social status and reputation in the town, which is threatened when Dave returns without letting them know and then deposits $5,500 ($58,700 in 2019) in the bank that competes with Frank's bank. Frank attempts to make amends with Dave in order to get him to move the bank deposit. Agnes wants nothing to do with Dave, but is forced to welcome him after two of her wealthy social acquaintances, Professor French and his daughter Gwen, a schoolteacher who also teaches creative writing, ask to meet Dave because they admire his books. When Dave meets Gwen, he immediately falls in love with her. She is attracted to him as well, but is afraid of the passionate feelings he arouses in her and of his lifestyle. Each time Gwen rejects him, he ends up back with Ginny, even though her lack of intelligence frustrates him and she is nothing like Gwen. Dave has also befriended a hard- partying but good-hearted gambler, Bama Dillert, and the two get into trouble when Ginny's ex-boyfriend, a gangster named Ray, comes to town stalking her. Frank is upset about the bad reflection on him from Dave's lifestyle. However, Dave is shown to be a good man despite his notorious reputation when he treats Ginny with kindness and takes a fatherly interest in his niece, Frank's daughter Dawn, who becomes upset and tries to run away when she sees her father in a lovers' lane with his secretary, Edith. Dave's new story that he wrote with Gwen's encouragement and editing is published in The Atlantic magazine, and Gwen confesses her love to him by telephone while he is on a gambling trip out of town with Bama and Ginny. Gwen's phone call leads the gamblers to think Dave is cheating at cards, triggering a fight in which Bama is stabbed. During his hospital stay, Bama is informed he has diabetes, but chooses to disregard medical advice, especially about his incessant drinking. Ginny visits Gwen at her school to ask if Gwen and Dave are in a relationship and confess her own love for Dave. Gwen is horrified to discover Dave has been seeing Ginny, assures Ginny that there is nothing between her and Dave, and then cuts Dave off. Dave, at the end of his rope from Gwen's rejection, decides to marry Ginny, even over Bama's objections. While she is not Dave's social or intellectual match, Dave recognizes that she gives him unconditional love that he's never had from anyone else. The two marry that night, but soon after they leave the judge's house, while walking among the crowds of the town's fair, Ray comes after them with a gun, shoots and injures Dave, and then shoots Ginny dead as she tries to protect Dave. In the final scene, most of the main characters are in attendance at Ginny's funeral, but with Dave and Bama standing separately and at a distance. In this final scene Bama removes his hat, which he never once took off, as a sign of respect for Ginny. Cast * Frank Sinatra as Dave Hirsh * Dean Martin as Bama Dillert * Shirley MacLaine as Ginny Moorehead * Martha Hyer as Gwen French * Arthur Kennedy as Frank Hirsh * Nancy Gates as Edith Barclay * Leora Dana as Agnes Hirsh * Betty Lou Keim as Dawn Hirsh * Larry Gates as Professor Robert Haven French * Connie Gilchrist as Jane Barclay Production Much of the film was shot in and around the town of Madison, Indiana. Shirley MacLaine reported that Sinatra was \\"besieged\\" by the local Indiana women, and that at one point a woman broke through a rope barrier around a house and flung herself at Sinatra as her husband ran to stop her, pleading \\"Helen, you don't even know the man!\\".The Courier News, Blytheville, Arkansas, June 22, 1974, \\"A Girl Named Sooner\\", page 4 One significant change from the James Jones novel was the death of Ginny; in the novel, it is Dave who is killed, shot in the face by the character of Ray. Reception Dean Martin, Martha Hyer, and Frank Sinatra at the world premiere of Some Came Running Released to critical plaudits, Some Came Running was praised both nationally and internationally on release, The Variety review stated, \\"Jones' novel has been stripped to essentials in the screenplay, and those are presented in hard clean dialog and incisive situations.\\"\\"Review: Some Came Running\\", Variety, 31 December 1957 Sinatra garnered some of the strongest notices of his career; Variety noted that \\"Sinatra gives a top performance, sardonic and compassionate, full of touches both instinctive and technical. It is not easy, either, to play a man dying of a chronic illness and do it with grace and humor, and this Martin does without faltering.\\" The film was popular with the public. According to MGM records, it earned $4,245,000 in the US and Canada and $2,050,000 elsewhere, becoming the 10th highest-earning film of 1958.\\"1959: Probable Domestic Take\\", Variety, January 6, 1960, p. 34 But its high cost meant that MGM would record a loss of $207,000 ($ million today) on the film. Academy Awards At the 31st Academy Awards, the film received the following nominations: * Best Actress: Shirley MacLaine * Best Actor in a Supporting Role: Arthur Kennedy * Best Actress in a Supporting Role: Martha Hyer * Best Original Song: \\"To Love and Be Loved,\\" Music by Jimmy Van Heusen; Lyrics by Sammy Cahn * Best Costume Design: Walter Plunkett Legacy Martin Scorsese included a clip from the film for his A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies; the film's final carnival scene remains for Scorsese one of the best and most expressive uses of CinemaScope. In his book Who the Hell's in It, director Peter Bogdanovich writes extensively about Some Came Running. He later filmed a short segment for Turner Classic Movies on its influence on cinema. In the 1997 movie Flubber, the robot Weebo uses a clip from the film as a shout-out for why she won't sabotage the professor’s relationship anymore. DVD Some Came Running was released to DVD by Warner Home Video on May 13, 2008 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD and also on the same date as part of the 5-disc box set Frank Sinatra: The Golden Years with Some Came Running as the fourth disc.

He was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the first round of the 2014 NFL Draft. He played college football at Tennessee. High school career James attended North Gwinnett High School in Suwanee, Georgia, where he was teammates with Austin Shepherd. In his sophomore season, North Gwinnett advanced to the GHSA Class 5A state championship game with 13–2 record, where they lost 34–6 to Valdosta Lowndes led by Greg Reid and Telvin Smith. As a junior, James helped North Gwinnett to a berth in state quarterfinals behind 10–3 finish, where they lost 20–3 to Alec Ogletree's Newnan. In James's senior season, North Gwinnett finished with a 13–1 mark, earning Region 7-5A championship while advancing to the state quarterfinals, where they lost 35–0 to Camden County. After the season, James was selected Class 5A All-State by Georgia Sportswriters, and was invited to play in the 2010 Under Armour All-America Game in St. Petersburg, Florida. Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, he was rated the eighth best offensive tackle prospect in his class and the sixth best prospect from Georgia.Ja'Wuan James - Yahoo Sports He was such a highly sought after prospect that Tennessee's head coach Lane Kiffin wanted to land a helicopter on North Gwinnett's softball field in an attempt to impress James, but was unable to receive clearance from the high school. College career James attended the University of Tennessee from 2010 to 2013. He started 49 consecutive games for the Volunteers, all at right tackle. His 49 starts set a record for career starts by an offensive lineman in Tennessee history (passing Jeff Smith's 48 starts from 1992 to 1995).

During the draft process, James had private workouts and meetings with a few teams, including the Tennessee Titans and Miami Dolphins.

More than 6,000 people have taken the organization's courses, which include: * LC101 is LaunchCode's part-time evening flagship course with curriculum developed to put you on the path to obtaining a job in tech. In a supportive classroom environment with in-person mentoring from instructors, teaching fellows and local developers, students learn foundational programming concepts in JavaScript before moving on to a skill track focused on either Java or C#. * CoderGirl: LaunchCode's education program for everyone who identifies as female was originally created as a meetup by women to lift up other women in tech. Students choose one of seven 24- or 45-week specialized skill tracks that lead to an apprenticeship job program. * Immersive CodeCamp is a 14-week, full-time course taking a deep dive into in-demand technologies and skills. Thanks to the smaller class size, each student will have access to more personal, hands-on mentorship and individualized support from our instructors. In addition to gaining the technical skills needed to start your career, Immersive CodeCamp will include a series of career workshops designed to cover all of the additional things employers will be looking for. * Liftoff is a career readiness and project course focused on getting learners with new coding skills through the challenging last job-readiness phase of their pre- apprenticeship learning journey. * Discovery is a free, self-paced online program developed to introduce curious individuals to computer programming and help them determine if continuing on to build the fundamental skills necessary to pursue a career in tech is right for them. Discovery aims to break down barriers by bringing education pathways directly to people in their communities. LaunchCode also offers apprenticeships: full-time, paid positions with partner companies. More than four out of five apprentices convert to permanent employment at their company in a median of 12 weeks. More than 80% of LaunchCode students do not have a four-year computer science degree. In 2019, 56% of students identified as people of color and 49% identified as female.

Service The 9th New York State Militia was not called up, but organized in New York City as a regiment of volunteers under Col. Michael M. van Beuren. The regiment left the state in May, 1861 under the leadership of Col. John W. Stiles and served at Washington, DC, mustering in to federal service there in June; in several different commands until August; in the Army of the Potomac from October; in 5th Corps, from March, 1862; in 3d Corps, Army of Virginia, from June; and in 1st Corps, Army of Potomac, from September. In May 1863, the three years' men of the 26th Infantry were transferred in. The regiment served again in 5th Corps, Army of Potomac, from March, 1864, and was honorably discharged and mustered out at New York City in June, 1864; men not entitled to be mustered out were transferred to the 97th Infantry. The 83rd served along the Potomac River in Maryland and at Harper's Ferry. In the spring of 1862 the regiment was stationed near Warrenton, Virginia and along the Rappahannock River; it participated in General John Pope's Virginia campaign, losing 75 men at the Battle of Second Bull Run. At South Mountain and Antietam, Confederate forces heavily engaged the 83rd, costing 114 at Antietam. The regiment lost even more at Fredericksburg—125 killed, wounded or missing—among whom was the severely wounded Colonel Hendrickson. The regiment spent the winter of 1862-3 at Falmouth, Virginia, and was not threatened during Chancellorsville, but played an important part at Gettysburg in the capture of Iverson's North Carolina brigade. Coming south, the regiment was stationed at Hagerstown, Maryland, and Liberty, Virginia; the 83rd camped near Brandy Station, Virginia, in the early winter of 1863-4.

Early life and education Stöckel was born in 1510 in the royal free city of Bártfa (Bardejov), where his father worked as a blacksmith and also served in the city council. He began his studies in his hometown under the guidance of Valentin Eck, himself a follower of renaissance humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam. Subsequently, he was sent to Kassa (Košice) where Leonard Cox taught that time. In 1530 Stöckel enrolled at the University of Wittenberg and became a student of Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon. During his stay in Wittenberg, Stöckel developed close ties with both of them and he also worked as a private tutor in Luther's birth town Eisleben (1533–1536). Stöckel remained in Saxony until 1539, when he returned to Hungary and became the rector of the school in his hometown Bártfa. Reformation in Hungary Stöckel immediately re-organized the school system in evangelical spirit and in 1540 he introduced new school laws (Leges scholae Bartphensis). His actions soon lifted the school to the level of those excellent German ones and attracted students from far and wide. Stöckel's return also saw the influence and reach of Lutheran ideas in Upper Hungary to grow significantly. He became an influential reformer, reached an agreement between the five most important royal free cities in Upper Hungary, the so-called Pentapolitana, and won them for the Reformation. Based on the Augsburg Confession of Melanchthon (1530), Stöckel wrote his own Lutheran confession, the Confessio Pentapolitana, that was adopted by the Pentapolitana members in July 1549. The Confessio Pentapolitana was recognized by King Ferdinand I in 1549 and confirmed again in 1558. In 1560 it was recognized as the only creed on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church by Nicolaus Olahus, Primate of Hungary as well.

He was twice Minister of Finance. Early years Martim Francisco Ribeiro de Andrada was born in Santos, São Paulo on 9 April 1775. At the time Santos was just a village. His parents were was Colonel José Bonifácio Ribeiro de Andrade and Maria Bárbara da Silva. His brothers were Antônio Carlos and José Bonifácio de Andrada. He attended the University of Coimbra in Portugal, where he received degrees in philosophy (1797) and mathematics (1798). He earned a PhD in Natural Sciences. At the university he worked with the friar José Mariano de Conceição Vellozo, a naturalist, in translating works on mineralogy and agriculture. After returning to Brazil, Ribeiro de Andrada was appointed inspector general of mines in São Paulo state. He traveled extensively in São Paulo in this role, making and recording many scientific findings. In this he was accompanied by his brother José Bonifácio and Lieutenant General Carlos Antônio Napion. In 1820 he and his brother made a tour of the province of São Paulo to find gold deposits. The same year he was appointed secretary and vice president of the provisional government of the province of São Paulo. After the decree of 29 September 1821 had been issued, aiming at again making Brazil a colony of Portugal, he and his brother José Bonifácio contributed to a patriotic proclamation on 24 December 1821. In January 1822 Martim's brother José was in the Court of Rio de Janeiro, then the principal city of Brazil, involved in the public administration and promoting independence. The Portuguese loyalists still dominated, but ill-judged acts of the court had started to create discontent. In the province of São Paulo General João Carlos managed to stamp out moves towards constitutional freedom. Martim was dismissed from the provisional government of São Paulo and sent as a prisoner to the Court of Rio de Janeiro.

Martim Ribeiro de Andrada is seated to her left and his brother José is standing and gesturing towards the Empress. Martim was appointed Secretary of State of Business and Finance from 4 July 1822 to 28 October 1822 in the first cabinet of the Empire of Brazil. Martim was dismissed on 28 October 1822 and reinstated as Minister of Finance on 30 October 1822. His brother José Bonifácio was restored as premier with the mandate of centralizing the union and preventing disorders. This first ministry was marked by a power struggle between José Bonifácio Ribeiro de Andrada and the Freemason group led by Joaquim Gonçalves Lêdo. Martim found that the Treasury of the new Empire of Brazil had no money, since King John VI had taken everything of value back to Portugal when he left the country. Martim Ribeiro de Andrada followed a nationalist policy in which he taxed imports, particularly from Portugal. On 30 December 1822 he signed a decree imposing a 24% duty on foreign manufactures other than those from England. Although the state was short of funds after the struggle for independence, Ribeiro de Andrada refused to resort to foreign loans, which he distrusted. Instead he established a ten- year compulsory loan secured by the income from the state of Rio de Janeiro, an unusual measure at the time. He obtained popular support by promising to transform Brazil from a land of slavery to one of freedom. He reorganized the tax system and by decree of 4 February 1823 created the administration to oversee taxes on products such as coffee and tobacco. Opposition and exile The energy of the Andrada brothers in this turbulent time made them enemies, and the first ministry fell on 17 July 1823. Out of power, the Andradas became strong voices of the opposition. Martim Ribeiro de Andrada was elected for the province of Rio de Janeiro to the General Constituent and Legislative Assembly of the Empire of Brazil. He was a strong and sometimes passionate speaker. He was chairman of the Assembly for the month of October 1823. On 12 November 1823 the Emperor dissolved the Assembly in an event known as the \\"Night of Agony\\". The three Andrada brothers and other former deputies were arrested and imprisoned until 20 November, when they and their families embarked for Le Havre, France as exiles. In his absence, Martim Francisco and Antônio Carlos Ribeiro de Andrada were accused of sedition. In 1828 the court began the trial that would lead to their acquittal of the sedition charge. The two returned to Rio de Janeiro, where they were imprisoned on the Ilha das Cobras. On 6 September 1828 they were absolved of the charges and freed from prison. Return to power In 1830 Martim Ribeiro de Andrada declined to become a counselor to the Emperor, who was struggling to maintain his position. He was elected deputy for the province of Minas Gerais for the term 5 May 1830 to 10 June 1833. He was President of the Chamber of Deputies from 4 May 1831 to 2 July 1831. He was a deputy for São Paulo from 3 May 1836 to 18 October 1841. Ribeiro de Andrada represented his home town of Santos in the Assembly. On 23 July 1840 the Empire of Brazil was restored after a period of anarchy and minority rule. Martim Francisco and Antônio Carlos Ribeiro de Andrada were appointed to the Council of the Crown by the Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Martim was Secretary and Minister of State for the Finance Department in the first Cabinet of the 2nd Empire, from 24 August 1840 to 23 March 1841. The country was in financial difficulties, but he was confident that it would recover and called for foreign loans to cover the deficit. Martim Ribeiro de Andrada was again President of the Chamber of Deputies from 25 April 1842 to 2 January 1843. He was a counselor to the Emperor and a member of the Brazilian Historical and Geographical Institute. Gabriela Frederica Ribeiro de Andrada and children Martim Francisco Ribeiro de Andrade died in Santos on 23 February 1844 aged 68. A Brazilian biography of 1861 said his name would live in the memory of his grateful homeland as long as civic virtue is honored and patriotism deserves worship. \\"He was one of the most devoted apostles of our freedoms, one of the great workers for our independence.\\" Family Ribeiro de Andrade married his niece Gabriela Frederica, daughter of Jose Bonifacio de Andrada e Silva, in Santos on 15 November 1820. They had three sons. Martim Francisco Ribeiro de Andrada II (born 1825) was deputy for São Paulo, Minister of Foreign Affairs (1866) and president of the Chamber of Deputies during the Second Empire (1882). José Bonifácio the Younger (born 1827) was a writer, senator of the Empire of Brazil and Minister of the Navy of Brazil. Antônio Carlos Ribeiro de Andrada (born 1836) was deputy for Minas Gerais in the House (1885) and Senator of the Constituent State (1891). Their two daughters were Maria Flora de Andrada and Narcisa de Andrada.

Ott was born and grew up in New York City. He attended Stuyvesant High School, received his bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from The Cooper Union, and his Ph.D. in Electrophysics from The Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. Following receipt of his Ph.D. he was an NSF postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics of Cambridge University. He then joined the faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Cornell University. Since 1979 he has been a faculty member jointly in the Department of Physics and the Department of Electrical Engineering at The University of Maryland, with the current titles of Distinguished University Professor, and Yuen Sang and Yuen Kit So Professor. Research areas Prior to his work on chaos and complex systems, Professor Ott had done extensive research in the field of plasma physics. His work on chaos theory and complex systems covers many areas. Some examples are the following: * chaotic scattering (including the onset of chaotic scattering as a system parameter is varied and the characteristics of the accompanying fractal structure); * fast magnetic dynamos in chaotic flows (addressing the origin of magnetic fields in planets, stars and galaxies); * chaotic transport in Hamilton dynamical systems (in which an effective Markov model was introduced to study anomalous transport resulting from the complex scaling structure of proliferating KAM islands); * fractal basin boundaries (demonstrating how they come about and how they present a barrier to prediction); * communicating with chaos (in which it was shown that chaotic systems could be controlled to follow orbits whose time variation could be tailored to convey information); * transitions of the dynamics of chaotic systems with variation of a system parameter (notably his work on \\"blow-out bifurcations\\" for systems with chaos on an invariant manifold [e.g., as in synchronization of chaotic systems] and his work introducing the concept of \\"crises\\" in which there are abrupt structural changes in chaotic dynamics characterized by scaling behavior of chaotic transients characterized by critical exponents); * quantum chaos (e.g., his work on the effect of noise on the dynamical version of Anderson localization of the quantum evolution of classically chaotic kicked systems); * weather forecasting (particularly his work devising new ways of assimilating measured data for state estimation of large spatiotemporally chaotic systems); and * the dynamics of large networks of interacting units (e.g., the so-called Ott- Antonsen ansatz for analyzing systems of many interacting oscillators). In what is perhaps Ott's most well-known contribution, he and his colleagues Celso Grebogi and James A. Yorke introduced the concept of controlling chaos. In particular, they have shown that dynamics on a chaotic attractor can be controlled by using only small perturbations. The key idea in this work is that embedded within a chaotic attractor there are typically an infinite number of unstable periodic orbits, any one of which can be stabilized by a small control (the O.G.Y. method), and that, by properly choosing which orbit to stabilize, enhanced performance can be achieved. As part of its 50th anniversary celebration, the journal, Physical Review Letters, selected this paper as one of its milestone publications. Awards * 2014.
