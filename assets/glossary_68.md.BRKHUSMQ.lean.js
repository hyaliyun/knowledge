The Association formed in 1870, was formerly chartered by the state in 1871, and was active until at least 1875. The stated purpose of the association was to attempt to elevate the profession of conveyancing, which had been steadily developing into a large profession in the city during the course of the 19th century. One of their earliest mentions is in an Ordinance of the City of Philadelphia allowing members of the Association to access the Recorder of Deeds office free of charge.O. 22 Nov. 1870, Sec. 1, 522. Several of its members were active in the formation of some of the nation's first title insurance companies. According to the first edition of Ladner's Conveyancing in Pennsylvania, the professional conveyancers working in Philadelphia in the mid-19th century were a \\"splendid set of men, proud of their calling and jealous of their unblemished reputations.\\" The examinations to enter the conveyancers' associations were considered more difficult than lawyer's bar examinations. Many of these conveyancers later went on to form the first title insurance companies in response to changing market conditions. By the time the book was first published in 1913, Ladner was of the opinion that the \\"old time conveyancers\\" had \\"practically disappeared\\" due to the advent of title insurance companies.Ladner, Grover Cleveland (1913) Conveyacing in Pennsylvania, pp 247-248 Members An incomplete list of officers and members from a meeting held in 1875 is as follows: * Hon.

During at least the 19th and 20th centuries, three annual fairs were held at Longfield townland on – May 16, October 10, and December 27, while four annual fairs were held at Carrigallen on- May 7, August 9, October 8, and December 31. =Museum artefacts= There are a number of medieval artifacts from Carrigallen barony preserved in a collection at the Royal Irish Academy museum in Dublin. A small medieval brooch-pin with highly decorated penannular rings was found on the bed of the Yellow river near the Ballyduff Bridge near Ballinamore, Oughteragh parish in county Leitrim, and a bronze medieval sword blade was found in the crevice of a rock on the same river, the blade being perfect, with a broad leaf pattern, bevel edge, handle-piece welded, six rivet-holes on the handle (two not through), with hilt notches, measures long by width. A Celt was found in the bed of the river at Ballyheedy bridge, at Ardrum downland near Ballinamore in county Leitrim, a good long narrow specimen, of bright yellow bronze, triangular shaped, flat-surfaced, and roughly decorated with a hammered fan-tailed ornament radiating towards the blade.

The campaign was initiated by Wu's founding emperor, Sun Quan, two years after the death of the second Wei emperor, Cao Rui. The campaign ended with an overall failure. Opening moves In the spring of 241, Sun Quan prepared to launch a campaign against Wei. Yin Zha (殷札), the administrator of Wu Commandery, advised Sun Quan to attack Wei in coordination with their ally state, Shu Han. According to Yin Zha's suggested plan, the Shu forces would attack Wei from the west of Chang'an, while the Wu forces would attack Wei from three directions: Zhuge Jin and Zhu Ran to attack Xiangyang; Lu Xun and Zhu Huan to attack Shouchun (壽春; present-day Shou County, Anhui); Sun Quan to attack the Huai River region and enter Xu Province. Yin Zha explained that this coordinated campaign would wear down Wei's defences because they were unable to fend off attacks on two fronts. However, Sun Quan did not follow his plan.(春，吳人將伐魏。零陵太守殷札言於吳主曰：「今天棄曹氏，喪誅累見，虎爭之際而幼童涖事。陛下身自御戎，取亂侮亡，宜滌荊、揚之地，舉強羸之數，使強者執戟，羸者轉運。西命益州，軍于隴右，授諸葛瑾、朱然大衆，直指襄陽，陸遜、朱桓別征壽春，大駕入淮陽，歷青、徐。襄陽、壽春，困於受敵，長安以西，務禦蜀軍，許、洛之衆，勢必分離，掎角並進，民必內應。將帥對向，或失便宜，一軍敗績，則三軍離心；便當秣馬脂車，陵蹈城邑，乘勝逐北，以定華夏。若不悉軍動衆，循前輕舉，則不足大用，易於屢退，民疲威消，時往力竭，非上策也。」吳主不能用。) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 74.  The campaign  Sometime between 28 April and 27 May, Wu forces attacked Wei at four different locations: Quan Cong attacked the Huai River region and clashed with Wei forces at Quebei (芍陂; south of present-day Shou County, Anhui); Zhuge Ke attacked Lu'an; Zhu Ran and Sun Lun (孫倫) attacked Fancheng (樊城; present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei); Zhuge Jin and Bu Zhi attacked Zhazhong (柤中; in present-day Xiangyang, Hubei). On the Wei side, Wang Ling and Sun Li led troops to resist Quan Cong at Quebei, defeated him, and drove him back. Hu Zhi (胡質) also led lightly-armed forces from Jing Province to reinforce Fancheng. Someone warned Hu Zhi that the Wu forces attacking Fancheng had superiority in numbers and advised him to refrain from resisting them. However, Hu Zhi said, \\"The defences at Fancheng are weak. We should advance there to reinforce them, or else there will be big trouble.\\" Having said that, he led his troops to Fancheng and restored stability in Fancheng.(夏，四月，吳全琮略淮南，決芍陂，諸葛恪攻六安，朱然圍樊，諸葛瑾攻柤中。征東將軍王淩、揚州刺史孫禮與全琮戰於芍陂，琮敗走。荊州刺史胡質以輕兵救樊，或曰：「賊盛，不可迫。」質曰：「樊城卑兵少，故當進軍為之外援，不然，危矣。」遂勒兵臨圍，城中乃安。) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 74.(二年夏五月，吳將全琮寇芍陂，朱然、孫倫圍樊城，諸葛瑾、步騭掠柤中， ...) Jin Shu vol. 1. Even after Hu Zhi reinforced Fancheng, the Wu forces did not withdraw from Jing Province. Sima Yi, the regent of Wei, heard about it and requested permission to lead troops to resist the enemy. However, there were some officials in the Wei imperial court who argued that there was no need to take swift action since Fancheng was strong enough to withstand attacks and that the enemy would be worn out after travelling a long distance. Sima Yi disagreed and pointed out that the Wu invasion posed a huge threat to Wei,(... 帝請自討之。議者咸言，賊遠來圍樊，不可卒拔。挫於堅城之下，有自破之勢，宜長策以御之。帝曰：「邊城受敵而安坐廟堂，疆埸騷動，衆心疑惑，是社稷之大憂也。」) Jin Shu vol. 1. because he knew that the loss of Fancheng would place Wei in a dangerous position. Between 26 June and 25 July, Sima Yi led an army from the Wei imperial capital, Luoyang, to fight the invaders. The Wei emperor Cao Fang personally saw them off at Luoyang's Jinyang Gate (津陽門). Upon reaching Fancheng, Sima Yi knew that he should not linger for too long because of the heat of summer. He then sent lightly-armed cavalry to harass the Wu forces but his main army remained in position. Later, he ordered the troops to pretend as if they were going to attack, so as to scare the enemy away. The Wu forces fell for the ruse and retreated overnight. Sima Yi and the Wei forces pursued the retreating Wu forces to the intersection of the Han, Bai and Tang rivers, where they defeated and killed over 10,000 enemy soldiers and captured their boats, equipment and other resources.(吳兵猶在荊州，太傅懿曰：「柤中民夷十萬，隔在水南，流離無主，樊城被攻，歷月不解，此危事也，請自討之。」六月，太傅懿督諸軍救樊；吳軍聞之，夜遁，追至三州口，大獲而還。) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 74.(六月，乃督諸軍南征，車駕送出津陽門。帝以南方暑溼，不宜持久，使輕騎挑之，然不敢動。於是休戰士，簡精銳，募先登，申號令，示必攻之勢。吳軍夜遁走，追至三州口，斬獲萬餘人，收其舟船軍資而還。天子遣侍中常侍勞軍于宛。) Jin Shu vol. 1.(六月，乃督諸軍南征，車駕送出津陽門。帝以南方暑溼，不宜持久，使輕騎挑之，然不敢動。於是休戰士，簡精銳，募先登，申號令，示必攻之勢。吳軍夜遁走，追至三州口，斬獲萬餘人，收其舟船軍資而還。) Jin Shu vol. 1.

Two years later, in 243, Zhuge Ke sent spies to scout the strategic locations near Shouchun (壽春; present-day Shou County, Anhui) in preparation for an attack on Shouchun. In October 243, Sima Yi led troops from Luoyang to attack Zhuge Ke at Wan (皖; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui). When Sima Yi and the Wei army reached Shu County (舒縣; present-day Shucheng County, Anhui), Zhuge Ke gave orders to burn down all the supplies stockpiled in Wan, abandon the garrison and retreat.(四年秋九月，帝督諸軍擊諸葛恪， ... 軍次于舒，恪焚燒積聚，棄城而遁。) Jin Shu vol. 1.

After successfully repelling the Wu invasion, the Wei imperial court wanted to promote agriculture and build up an abundant stockpile of food supplies in Yang and Yu provinces in preparation for a future campaign against Wu. Deng Ai was sent to survey the lands in the Huai River region from Chen Commandery (陳郡; around present-day Zhoukou, Henan) east to Shouchun, and he proposed constructing a series of canals to irrigate the lands. Sima Yi approved Deng Ai's plan. The project commenced in the following year and helped to resolve not only food shortages but also flooding problems once it was in place.(朝廷欲廣田畜穀於揚、豫之間，使尚書郎汝南鄧艾行陳、項以東至壽春。艾以為：「昔太祖破黃巾，因為屯田，積穀許都以制四方。今三隅已定，事在淮南，每大軍出征，運兵過半，功費巨億。陳、蔡之間，土下田良，可省許昌左右諸稻田，幷水東下，令淮北二萬人，淮南三萬人，什二分休，常有四萬人且田且守；益開河渠以增溉灌，通漕運。計除衆費，歲完五百萬斛以為軍資，六、七年間，可積二千萬斛於淮上，此則十萬之衆五年食也。以此乘吳，無不克矣。」太傅懿善之。是歲，始開廣漕渠，每東南有事，大興軍衆，汎舟而下，達于江、淮，資食有儲而無水害。) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 74.

Location The power station is located in Naivasha, Nakuru County, approximately , by road, northwest of Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, and the largest city in that country. The approximate coordinates of the power plant are:0°41'37.0\\"S, 36°25'55.0\\"E (Latitude:-0.693611; Longitude:36.431944). Overview The power station, which is expected to come online in March 2015, has a generating capacity of 2.4 Megawatts. Construction was completed in January 2015. Biojoule Kenya Limited, the company that owns he power station, signed a 20-year power purchasing agreement with Kenya Power and Lighting Company, to supply 2MW to the national electricity grid. Once operational, the power station will be the first biogas-fired power plant to sell power to the national grid. Power is generated using plant waste generated on the Gorge Farm, near Lake Naivasha, owned by VP Group, an investor in the power project. The plant material is allowed to decompose anaerobically, generating gases, including methane. The gases are burnt, generating heat, which is used to heat water, generating steam. The steam is then used to run electricity generators. Some of the heat is used to warm greenhouses on the arm. The power generated will be evacuated via a substation within nearby Naivasha Town. Developers and financing Biojoule Power Station was constructed at a cost of KSh591 million (US$6.5 million). The power station is 50% owned by the family that owns VP Group. The remaining 50% is owned by unnamed investors from the United Kingdom. CfC Stanbic Bank provided a loan of US$3.25 million, while the owners raised the remaining US$3.25. The power remaining over after sale to Kenya Power will be sold to the VP Group and some will be used internally by the power station. Other considerations In addition to producing electricity and heat, the plant will produce an estimated 35,000 tonnes of fertilizer annually, from the remnants of anaerobic digestion. In addition to the plant material generated at Gorge Farm Energy Park, more raw material will be sourced from the neighboring Van den Berg Roses Farm.

Waterford, Ireland), was an Irish-born British Army officer who saw service in World War II. Early life and military career Kendal Chavasse was born in Waterford, Ireland, on 28 September 1904. He was the third son (with four brothers) of Major Henry Chavasse (1863-1943) and his second wife Judith Isabella Fleming (1867-1935). Two brothers served (with distinction) in the Royal Navy (Commander Evelyn Henry Chavasse DSO DSC and Captain Paul Chavasse CBE DSC and Bar). He married Oonah Perceval-Maxwell in 1930; the couple had a son and a daughter. Chavasse was also intended to join the Royal Navy and to that end he was educated at the Royal Naval College, Osborne, and the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. However, illness prevented his timely start as a naval cadet until he was too old to do so, but, through family contacts, he was accepted into the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he graduated, alongside Thomas \\"Pat\\"Scott, on 30 August 1924 as a second lieutenant in the Royal Irish Fusiliers (Princess Victoria's). His first years of military service during the interwar period consisted largely of regimental duties, serving with his regiment in Egypt, India, the Sudan and the United Kingdom. Among his fellow officers in the battalion, in addition to \\"Pat\\" Scott from Sandhurst days, was Gerald Templer. Chavasse was promoted to lieutenant on 30 August 1926, and, due to the slow rate of promotion in peacetime, was only promoted to captain on 3 October 1935. In May 1937 he was posted to the 2nd Battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers, then serving in Malta, and was appointed Adjutant, and he later served in Palestine during the Arab revolt. In January 1939 Chavasse returned to the United Kingdom where he attended the Staff College, Camberley, where Scott was among his fellow students. Second World War He had wartime service as Commanding Officer of 56th Reconnaissance Regiment (nicknamed \\"Chavasse's Light Horse\\"). 56 Recce fought in Tunisia as part of 78th Division and between 25 November and 10 December 1942 it operated east of Oued Med Jerga. Despite being outnumbered and outgunned and without effective air protection, 56 Recce dominated its area. This was attributed to Chavasse's \\"personal example, dash and daring\\" and consequently he was awarded his first Distinguished Service Order. 56 Recce stayed with 78th Division during the Italian campaign and at Termoli on 5 October, Chavasse led a mixed force consisting of part of his regiment, 3 Commando, a troop of the Special Raiding Squadron and an anti-tank battery; this force held an exposed position under heavy attack. Superior forces were held off during the day and, when ordered to withdraw, Chavasse extracted his force almost entirely. Once again, much was attributed to his leadership and he was awarded a Bar to his DSO, the citation praised his \\"exceptional leadership, coolness and devotion to duty\\" and stated that \\"his personal example was the mainspring of a gallant and effective defence which did much to ensure the successful outcome of the operations\\". As a temporary Colonel, he served briefly with 5th Army as British Deputy Chief of Staff and then returned to England to run the Reconnaissance Training Centre at Catterick. From March 1946 he served as GSOI with 6th Armoured Division at Padua. He commanded the Royal Irish Fusiliers' 2nd Battalion in December, a role he continued in Egypt and Palestine until his retirement in 1947. Retirement Chavasse retired to a new family home, a farm in Co. Waterford. Once again, he displayed customary enthusiasm and action, and became an innovative farmer, pioneering methods new to his area. He was a founder member of the Irish Farmers' Association and a prominent participant in local activities such as the West Waterford Hunt and the Dungarvan Show. He was a devout Christian and became the longest-serving lay reader in Ireland, assisting with services, including the annual Armistice Day service, throughout the diocese. He also represented his diocese at the 1963 World Anglican Conference in Toronto. He was a member of the Diocesan Council and the General Synod of the Church of Ireland.

Note: this is an enlargement of the previous image of Slipher Crater. Slipher is an impact crater in the Thaumasia quadrangle of Mars, located at 47.3°S latitude and 84.6°W longitude. It measures 127 kilometers in diameter and was named after American astronomers Vesto and Earl Slipher. The naming was approved by IAU's Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature in 1973.  Description  Gullies are visible on the walls of a crater that is on the rim of Slipher. They can be seen in the pictures below. Martian gullies are small, incised networks of narrow channels and their associated downslope sediment deposits, found on the planet of Mars. They are named for their resemblance to terrestrial gullies. First discovered on images from Mars Global Surveyor, they occur on steep slopes, especially on the walls of craters. Usually, each gully has a dendritic alcove at its head, a fan-shaped apron at its base, and a single thread of incised channel linking the two, giving the whole gully an hourglass shape.Malin, M., Edgett, K. 2000. Evidence for recent groundwater seepage and surface runoff on Mars. Science 288, 2330–2335. They are believed to be relatively young because they have few, if any craters. A subclass of gullies is also found cut into the faces of sand dunes which themselves considered to be quite young. On the basis of their form, aspects, positions, and location amongst and apparent interaction with features thought to be rich in water ice, many researchers believed that the processes carving the gullies involve liquid water. However, this remains a topic of active research. As soon as gullies were discovered, researchers began to image many gullies over and over, looking for possible changes. By 2006, some changes were found.Malin, M., K. Edgett, L. Posiolova, S. McColley, E. Dobrea. 2006. Present-day impact cratering rate and contemporary gully activity on Mars. Science 314, 1573_1577. Later, with further analysis it was determined that the changes could have occurred by dry granular flows rather than being driven by flowing water.Kolb, et al. 2010. Investigating gully flow emplacement mechanisms using apex slopes. Icarus 2008, 132-142.McEwen, A. et al. 2007. A closer look at water-related geological activity on Mars.

ScienceDaily, 22 March 2014. www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140322094409.htm With more repeated observations, more and more changes have been found; since the changes occur in the winter and spring, experts are tending to believe that gullies were formed from dry ice. Before-and-after images demonstrated the timing of this activity coincided with seasonal carbon-dioxide frost and temperatures that would not have allowed for liquid water. When dry ice frost changes to a gas, it may lubricate dry material to flow especially on steep slopes.http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-226http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_032078_1420http://www.space.com/26534-mars- gullies-dry-ice.html In some years frost, perhaps as thick as 1 meter.

Inclusive Church is an organisation founded in 2003 by Giles Fraser that advocates for the full inclusion of all people regardless of ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation, in the Christian churches (especially the Church of England), including in the threefold order of bishops, priests and deacons. More broadly, it seeks \\"to raise awareness about the ways that people feel excluded by the church\\". Founding and organisation Inclusive Church was founded in 2003, following the resignation of Jeffrey John, a celibate gay priest, as Bishop-designate of Reading, following controversy over his homosexuality. Its first chair was Giles Fraser, then vicar of St Mary's, Putney and later Canon Chancellor of St Paul's Cathedral. The organisation's petition against John's resignation achieved nearly 10,000 signatures. In the decade after its creation, Inclusive Church's focus broadened away from sexual orientation. The organisation seeks to include all who feel excluded from churches. In 2014–2015, the organisation published a series of books under the title Inclusive Church Resource, dealing with disability, mental health, sexuality, poverty, ethnicity, and gender. Inclusive Church's national co-ordinator is Ruth Wilde. Its board includes elected independent trustees alongside representatives from other organisations with similar aims, such as Changing Attitude, the Association of Black Clergy, Women and the Church, and Modern Church. Most member churches are part of the Church of England, but there are also member churches from the Methodist Church, the United Reformed Church, independent churches and churches outside the UK.  Lectures  In 2013, Inclusive Church started hosting an annual lecture related to the organisation's goals. The inaugural lecture was given by Martyn Percy, then principal of Ripon College, Cuddesdon, and later Dean of Christ Church, Oxford, and was entitled \\"Beyond Inclusion: Whose Church Is It Anyway?\\" In 2014, the lecture was given by Linda Woodhead, Professor of Sociology of Religion at Lancaster University, and was entitled \\"Whatever happened to Liberal Christianity?\\"  2015 General Synod campaign  In January 2015, Inclusive Church, in partnership with other organisations, began a campaign focused on the General Synod of the Church of England elections taking place later that year. The campaign aimed to \\"work against discrimination\\" in the Church of England during the five-year synod term. It was described by the campaign co-ordinator as \\"an attempt to increase the number of people on General Synod, both lay and clergy, who would take an inclusive line against discrimination on areas of gender, race and sexual orientation\\".

Fromm had refused to cooperate in an earlier coup, Operation Spark (1940), but the planners in 1944 still planned to use the Reserve Army.

He claims that he registered as a gun lobbyist even before the NRA had its own people lobbying the Capitol. In the early 1970s, he helped to found the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms (CCRKBA).

Saint Gabriel Possenti Society In 1987, Snyder founded the Saint Gabriel Possenti Society to promote public recognition of Gabriel and to lobby for Gabriel's designation by the Vatican as the \\"patron saint of hand gunners\\". According to the society, Gabriel's marksmanship and proficiency with handguns allegedly saved the village of Isola del Gran Sasso from a band of 20 marauding bandits in 1860. This is in reference to a story mentioned in one biography of the saint, though the author admitted that some of the accounts in his book were invented to \\"enliven\\" the story. No account of the event is present in any other independently researched biographies, making it seem unlikely. Moreover, at the time of the alleged incident, 1860, Gabriel was in the later stages of tuberculosis, making such strenuous exercise impossible.

Approximately 1,500 police officers, civilian members and public servants dedicate their efforts to a number of business lines, including financial integrity, national and border security, and organized crime enforcement. The RCMP in Quebec relies on dedicated resources to conduct investigations, provide VIP protective services and undertake crime prevention initiatives in communities in all areas of Quebec. The role of the RCMP in Quebec is strictly to enforce federal statutes. \\"C\\" Division differs in that respect from its RCMP counterparts in most Canadian provinces and from its policing partners in Quebec, that are guided by the concept of community policing. However, by joining forces and intelligence capabilities with its partners in Canada and abroad, \\"C\\" Division is able to conduct successful interterritorial investigations.  Structure  In addition to its headquarters located in Montreal, \\"C\\" Division is composed of detachments that are divided geographically into two districts, namely East and West districts. Map of \\"C\\" Division detachments  History  In 1920, the Federal Government authorized the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to establish its first detachment in Quebec, specifically in Montreal. Staffed with ten members, this office with barracks was housed in an old building located at 283 Sherbrooke Street, across from the main entrance of McGill University. The building was demolished in 1940. The officer commanding this detachment was a superintendent named Wilcox, who was known mostly for his work in Western Canada. Later that year the RCMP opened a one-man detachment in Quebec City, thus serving the two largest urban centres in the province. Shortly after, the RCMP provided police presence along the international border to collect customs fees and to secure the border from illegal immigrants. Back then, \\"C\\" Division was tasked with the responsibility of enforcing some forty federal statutes. Around 1921, the RCMP opened a few detachments near Indian reserves for the purposes of maintaining law and order and enforcing the Indian Act, governing in particular the control and sale of alcoholic beverages. Montreal RCMP Headquarters today Between 1920 and 1932, the RCMP considered the Province of Quebec as a simple district without alphabetical designation, whereas Eastern Ontario was designated as \\"A\\" Division and Western Ontario as \\"O\\" Division. Back then the letter \\"C\\" was used to designate the Province of Manitoba, whose divisional post was located in Brandon. Detachment work consisted mainly in the application of Indian legislation, the Customs Act and the Migratory Birds Convention Act, while drug and counterfeit currency enforcement was an important part of police work in Montreal. The first major change for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Quebec occurred in 1932, when it absorbed the Customs and Excise Preventive Service. All 175 members and 35 vessels and crews that were once the responsibility of that department came under the direction of the RCMP. This is how the RCMP Marine Service came to be. Operating with a limited complement of 33 members and 4 detachments in 1931, the RCMP then grew to a membership of 156 men and 31 detachments in Quebec. Given the additional duties brought about by the merger with the Customs and Excise Preventive Service, RCMP officers had to patrol the territory by land, sea and air to fight against alcohol smuggling and other forms of contraband, or to provide assistance to vessels in distress. Due to the increased workforce, the RCMP had to rethink its district structure. The term district, used by the Force to designate its area of jurisdiction in the Province of Quebec, which was then under the command of Superintendent Dawn, was replaced by \\"C\\" Division. = Defining events of their role and history = Churchill in Québec City RCMP participation was required in numerous events of major importance that took place in the Province of Quebec, as the responsibilities of the Force include protecting VIPs during their visits to Canada and providing assistance to other police departments in the province during major events. * Visit of Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt to Québec City in 1943 In 1943, as the Second World War was raging in Europe, US troops joined their Canadian and European allies on the front lines. Since 1939, the two heads of state have held five conferences for the purpose of developing strategies to defeat the enemy’s devastating offensive. They chose Québec City for their sixth conference. So from August 17 to 24, 1943, US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill met within the walls of this fortified town for the Québec Conference, hosted by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. Along with high-ranking officers of their respective armies, they planned military operations that led to the Allied victory over Axis forces. * Visit of French General Charles de Gaulle to Québec City on July 12, 1944 During his trip to America a few weeks after the Allied landings in Normandy, General Charles de Gaulle visited Québec City and Montréal. Even though his stop in Montréal lasted only a few hours, he attended a formal reception held in his honour at the Windsor Hotel. A number of dignitaries gathered for the occasion, including Quebec Premier Adélard Godbout.Bilan du siècle - Université de Sherbrooke http://bilan.usherbrooke.ca/bilan/pages/evenements/762.html * Expo 67 and the visit of Charles de Gaulle Mounties at Expo 67 With the opening of the Universal Exhibition in Montréal, Expo 67, Quebec became the focus of attention worldwide for an entire summer. The President of France, General Charles de Gaulle, made an official visit to Quebec on that occasion. From the balcony of Montréal City Hall, he said \\"Vive le Québec libre!\\" [Long Live Free Quebec], drawing cheers from an ecstatic crowd.De Gaulle - Encyclopédie du patrimoine culturel de l'Amérique française http://www.ameriquefrancaise.org/fr/article-8/De_Gaulle_et_«_Vive_le_Québec_libre!_».html The Montreal Olympic Games * 1976 Summer Olympic Games in Montréal On July 17, 1976, the entire world watched on as the opening ceremonies of 21st Olympic Games unfolded in Montréal. The world-renowned Olympic Stadium, Montréal's architectural landmarks, was built for that occasion. The building features the world's highest leaning tower. * The 2001 Summit of the Americas in Québec City From April 20 to 22, 2001, 34 democratically elected heads of state and government of North America, Central America, South America and the Caribbean met in Québec City for the third Summit of the Americas. The meeting is probably best remembered for the security measures put in place for the event and for the numerous public demonstrations that were held as the meetings took place. The Québec Summit attracted more than 50,000 demonstrators from across the Americas, ranking it among the top alterglobalist protest events to this day. This international event, in which the RCMP played a key role, was marked by the largest security operation in Canadian history. * The 2008 Francophonie Summit in Québec City In October 2008, the largest ceremonial event ever to be held in Canada took place in Québec City, as 70 heads of state attended the 12th Conference of Heads of State and Government of Countries Using French as a Common Language, commonly called the Francophonie Summit. This Summit provides world leaders sharing the French language with an opportunity to discuss topics such as international policy, the environment, Francophone cooperation, human rights, education, culture and democracy. The Summit is held every two years and is the highest authority in La Francophonie. Security for the Francophonie Summit, which was provided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Service de police de la Ville de Québec and Sûreté du Québec, also required the collaboration of several federal, provincial and municipal partners and agencies.  RCMP services in Quebec  Although its primary focus is on the fight against major organized crime at the national and international levels, the RCMP has diverse responsibilities in Quebec.Our Services in Quebec http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/qc/info/a_propos-about-eng.htm This section provides an overview of the duties performed by RCMP officers in \\"C\\" Division. = Organized crime enforcement = Organized crime is one of five strategic priorities established by the RCMP. It is defined by the Criminal Code as crime committed by any group of at least three people that has as one of its main purposes or activities the facilitation or commission of one or more serious offences where the primary motive is profit. Organized crime networks are an international problem that ignores national boundaries. This is why the RCMP advocates partnerships with the public and other Canadian and foreign law enforcement organizations to carry out its investigations.Organized Crime - \\"C\\" Division http://www.rcmp.gc.ca/soc- cgco/index-eng.htm Seized dirty money and firearms  Integrated Proceeds of Crime Unit (IPOC)  IPOC investigators hit criminal organizations by targeting the proceeds of crime and the very motivation behind any criminal activity, i.e. profit, by seizing the assets purchased by criminal elements with \\"dirty\\" money. IPOC investigators work in conjunction with other RCMP units and several outside agencies, police departments, foreign enforcement agencies, banks and professional corporations.  Combined forces Special Enforcement Unit (CFSEU)  The Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit (CFSEU) is tasked with investigating major crime in partnership with local, national and international agencies in an effort to curtail the expansion and development of organized crime in Quebec.  Aboriginal Combined forces Special Enforcement Unit (A-CFSEU)  Its goal is to investigate, pursue and dismantle criminal organizations whose negative impact and intimidation methods pose a direct threat to the best interests and well-being of Quebec’s Aboriginal communities. = Financial Integrity = Their role is to prevent what is known as “white collar crime”, whether national or international in scope, through federal law enforcement.  Federal Investigation Section  The strategic objective of the Federal Investigation Section program is to ensure the health and safety of communities, protect the public and maintain Canada's economic integrity. The primary mandate of the Federal Investigation Section is to enforce federal statutes and related regulations through a combination of proactive and reactive strategies. The proactive program combines prevention, education and enforcement measures partnered with affected client communities. Reactive investigations are initiated in response to requests for RCMP assistance received from other federal departments and agencies. The Federal Investigation Section investigates criminal offences under federal statutes with the help of the appropriate federal department. Through the provisions of 18 Memoranda of Understanding, the Section also provides assistance to partner agencies as well as various federal agencies and stakeholders in conducting investigations under any one of some 250 federal statutes. The program is enforced through five sub-sections.  Integrated Technological Crime Unit (ITCU)  The Integrated Technological Crime Unit (ITCU) is composed of police investigators and civilian members and is responsible for investigating computer crimes of national or international scope and providing technical assistance to other investigative units. The ITCU investigates offences such as unauthorized access to a computer or computer network (computer intrusion or hacking), mischief in relation to data (theft, manipulation, deletion, etc.), and possession of equipment or passwords facilitating these offences. The mandate of the ITCU is four-fold: investigation, computer support, intelligence and prevention. =Investigation= * Investigate computer crimes where the federal government is the victim. * Conduct and coordinate investigations of criminal or terrorist activities targeting Canada’s national critical infrastructure from a technological perspective. * Assist in joint national security investigations of technological significance. * In cases where the computer crime is as significant as the substantive offence, investigate jointly with the RCMP unit having primary jurisdiction for the substantive offence. * In cases where the RCMP does not have primary jurisdiction, conduct, with the consent of the police service having jurisdiction, national or international interest investigations of offences involving considerable financial loss or are extremely complex. * Investigate local technological crimes at the request of the police service having primary jurisdiction, subject to resource availability and in accordance with applicable legislation.  Commercial Crime Section  Commercial Crime Section members investigate, control and prevent what is known as \\"white collar crime\\", whether national or international in scope, through federal law enforcement. Their efforts are focused on the following areas: counterfeiting, bribery and corruption, fraudulent bankruptcy and major general fraud.  Integrated Market Enforcement Team (IMET)  The mandate of the Integrated Market Enforcement Team (IMET) is to investigate major cases of financial fraud involving large- cap companies for which allegations of fraud could significantly shake or undermine investor confidence in Canadian financial markets. Investigations deal with major financial crime offences, i.e. fraud, fraudulent manipulation of stock market operations, false financial statements, fraudulent bankruptcies, secret commissions, etc. = Border Integrity = The \\"C\\" Division Border Integrity Program contributes to the national security of Canada and protects Canadians from terrorism, organized crime and other border-related criminality, while allowing for the secure and effective international movement of people and goods. To achieve this goal, “C” Division works in close partnership with provincial, national and international government agencies as well as the community at large. The various sections and teams contributing to ensure border security include: The members of Immigration and Passport Section focus their efforts on detecting and disrupting the main criminal activities relating to immigration, passport and citizenship: organized migrant smuggling, services provided by so-called immigration consultants, fraudulent corporate use of the immigration program, human trafficking, forgery of citizenship cards, visas, passports and other documents. The RCMP works in close partnership with Citizenship and Immigration Canada and Foreign Affairs. The members of Customs and Excise Section fight all forms of smuggling activity involving national and international organized crime. Their investigations focus mainly on illicit alcohol, tobacco products, firearms and jewelry. The Integrated Border Enforcement Teams work in close cooperation with their partners in Canada and the United States. The IBET mandate is to target criminal activity and to ensure national security at the border. The Coastal/Airport Watch Program was established to assist in the identification of persons, vessels, vehicles and aircraft that may constitute a threat to Canada’s national security, or that may be involved in illegal activity. The National Ports Strategy is part of the organization's overall mandate to ensure border integrity. In \\"C\\" Division, the investigators’ role consists in coordinating the collection of intelligence for the Members of the Airport Federal Investigation Section are responsible for fighting organized crime at the Montreal – Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport and for assisting airport partners and authorities and co-operating with them to ensure passenger safety. This joint marine security initiative is led by the RCMP and the Canadian Coast Guard to further enhance national security and strengthen Canada's response to potential threats. It strengthens marine enforcement presence in a region heavily traveled by both small and large craft. It involves the deployment of vessels conducting joint security patrols on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence waterway.

Its scope includes espionage, sabotage, insurgency, treason, terrorism, extremism, offences committed against Canadian or foreign VIPs or diplomats, and offences committed for the purpose of supporting or funding individuals involved in the commission of such offences. = Criminal Intelligence= The Criminal Information Analytical Section is responsible for collecting and analyzing information on the criminal elements operating in the province. The Section offers direct intelligence support to all other RCMP sectors in Quebec, in addition to providing sound advice to management on the development of national and provincial crime control strategies. = Protective Services = The RCMP claims to be a leader in the delivery of protective services, a significant area of activity for federal police in Quebec that leaves no room for error.Protective Services - \\"C\\" Division http://www.rcmp.gc.ca/pp/index-eng.htm RCMP officers carry out high- risk duties while protecting VIPs and their spouses, including the Prime Minister of Canada and the Governor General, foreign heads of state and dignitaries visiting Quebec. VIPSS member on duty during the visit of Prince William, who appears in this picture with Quebec Premier Jean Charest and Québec City Mayor Régis Labeaume The second mandate of VIPSS relates to Internationally Protected Persons (IPPs), as defined in the Criminal Code, who must be provided with varying levels of protection while in Canada. Consequently, VIPSS provide physical protection to foreign heads of state, ambassadors and consuls visiting Quebec. VIPSS also provide personal protection to the Prime Minister of Canada, the Governor General, two former Prime Ministers as well as the leaders of Canadian political parties during federal elections. Members of VIPSS carry out the following duties: * bodyguard * motorcade driver * site security * House of Commons security * aircraft protective services  Overview of major investigations over the past 15 years  The history of the RCMP is marked with numerous major investigations of national and international scope. Below is an overview of some of the investigations that have made the RCMP in Quebec famous. = Project Colisée = RCMP escorting an arrested individual. Project Colisée, the most expensive RCMP investigation costing $35 million, and the largest raid against the Italian Mafia in Canadian history,Projet Colisée: une rafle historique - La Presse, November 23, 2006 http://www.lapresse.ca/dossiers/operation-colisee/200810/07/01-27221-projet- colisee-une-rafle-historique.php took place on the morning of November 22, 2006 by 700 police officers, after lasting four years. The partners of the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit dealt a serious blow to traditional organized crime by conducting numerous searches on that day in the Montreal region. Among the 90 people arrested, were Nicolo Rizzuto, Paolo Renda, Rocco Sollecito, Francesco Arcadi, Lorenzo Giordano and Francesco Del Balso; over 1,000 charges of crimes committed between 2003 and 2006 were laid, including gangsterism, conspiracy to import drugs, drug trafficking, illegal gambling, extortion, corruption of civil servants and tax evasion. The RCMP had fitted the Rizzuto crime family's headquarters, the Consenza Social Club, with microphones and cameras to amass sufficient evidence against the organization. Almost everyone arrested pleaded guilty. Project Colisée collected more than a million hours of wiretap evidence, and a total of $4 million was seized in the raid. Project Colisée was a wide-ranging investigation aimed at curbing the growth and development of organized crime in Canada. Project Colisée was led by the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit (CFSEU), a joint unit coordinated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and also involving the Sûreté du Québec, Service de police de la ville de Montréal (SPVM), Service de protection des citoyens de Laval, Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), and Canada Revenue Agency. Through Project Colisée, CFSEU investigators were able to infiltrate the criminal organization and to take it by surprise in various ways by identifying and arresting the leaders of the organization, by uncovering conspiracies to import cocaine via the Montréal Trudeau Airport. In 2005, a 300 kilogram shipment of a total 1,300 kilograms of cocaine, co- organized by Rizzuto confidante, Francesco Del Balso and West End Gang member, Richard Griffin, was intercepted in Boucherville, Quebec by police. Online bookmaking and sports betting businesses run by the Rizzutos, were allegedly estimated to generate over $26 million over a period of 18 months. = Project Celsius = On April 18, 2012, a police operation conducted by the RCMP resulted in the arrest of nine suspects in connection with the importation of a series of hashish shipments totalling 43.3 metric tonnes. This international police operation was conducted with the collaboration of law enforcement authorities in Pakistan, Italy, Belgium and the United States. This investigation, dubbed Project CELSIUS, was initiated in the summer of 2010 by the Montréal RCMP Drug Section jointly with the RCMP National Ports Enforcement Teams in Montréal and Halifax. It serves as an example of the firm commitment made by the RCMP to fight domestic criminal organizations with international ramifications that infiltrate legitimate businesses in our country in order to engage in criminal activity, thus compromising the safety of our communities. The investigation was initiated after the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) found drugs in offshore containers at the ports of Montréal and Halifax in 2009 and 2010. This investigation shows that the criminal organization involved purchased drugs from Asia, primarily originating in Afghanistan and transported via Pakistan. The hashish was hidden in containers that were shipped by boat and transited through several ports before being routed to Canada. Some of the suspicious containers were seized in Pakistan, while others were intercepted en route to Canada, specifically in Italy and Belgium. = Project Chabanel = The vessel used by the RCMP during Project Chabanel On May 10, 2006, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police conducted a one-of-a-kind police operation, seizing off the shores of Africa an impressive 22.5-ton shipment of hashish intended for the Canadian market directly from the hands of its suppliers. Three conspirators linked to the West End Gang criminal organization were arrested, resulting in the elimination of an 'import\\" cell of this Montreal-based criminal organization. This operation, dubbed Project \\"Chabanel\\", was carried out in close cooperation with Canada's Department of National Defence and RCMP liaison officers in England, Morocco, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates and Spain. For more than a year and a half, the investigators of Montreal and Halifax RCMP Drug Sections carefully worked out every detail of this international police operation. The investigation was launched on the basis of information to the effect that a subject linked to the West End Gang was involved in a major hashish importation conspiracy from Africa. The organization first had to find a crew and ship suitable for deep-water navigation and for transporting the drugs. Project “Chabanel” was therefore initiated by the RCMP. A vessel was chartered for the purposes of the operation. The vessel traveled to a predetermined location approximately 200 miles off the coast of Angola in Southern Africa. At this point the drugs were transferred from the supply vessel, whose crew was primarily made up of Filipino sailors, to the RCMP vessel. The RCMP complement spent more than 43 days at sea in order to seize the 22.5 tons of hashish and thus prevent its distribution to communities in Canada. HMCS Fredericton, a Department of National Defence frigate, followed the RCMP vessel at a distance and provided necessary assistance throughout the journey, ensuring the safety of the police officers and serving as command post. Once transhipment was completed to the RCMP vessel, the drugs were brought into Canada and taken to Montreal under heavy police escort. The drug shipment was to be delivered to the West End Gang on June 2, 2006. This is when the arrests were made. The federal police seized the 22.5 tons of hashish and CAN$195,000 from the criminal organization. \\"C\\" Division of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which is responsible for the enforcement of federal statutes in Quebec and southeastern Ontario, was proud to be the recipient of the IACP/ChoicePoint Award for Excellence in Criminal Investigations that was awarded to its Montreal Drug Section by the International Association of Chiefs of Police for this operation carried out in the open sea. The RCMP shared this award with the Department of National Defence. = Project Compote = In 1990, the RCMP Integrated Proceeds of Crime Unit conducted an investigation, dubbed Project Compote, in which the police opened its own phony currency exchange office, the Centre international monétaire de Montréal, for the purpose of arresting drug traffickers using this exchange office to launder drug money. All employees in that office were in fact RCMP officers who had been trained beforehand by the National Bank of Canada to act as professional tellers.Book : Mafia Inc.: The Long, Bloody Reign of Canada's Sicilian Clan by André Cédilot and André Noël, Les Éditions de l'Homme, chapter 9 This police investigation ended in late August 1994 with a total of 46 people arrested, including Sabatino Nicolucci and a Rizzuto crime family lawyer, Joseph Lagana. $160 million, including $140 million from criminals, were intercepted through this storefront operation. = Project Cléopâtre = In June 2006, more than 350 police officers took part in a large-scale operation aimed at dismantling a criminal organization specializing in the trafficking and exportation of marijuana and ecstasy to the United States, as well as money laundering. A total of 42 searches were conducted in the Estrie and Montreal regions, leading to the arrest of 36 subjects, including the alleged leader of this ring, a resident of Kanesetake. This major investigation, dubbed \\"Project CLÉOPÂTRE\\", was carried out by members of the Aboriginal Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit (A-CFSEU). The members of this network were charged with criminal organization offence, drug trafficking, conspiracy to traffic in drugs, money laundering, and possession of prohibited weapons. A total of 125 charges were laid against 36 suspects. As a result of this major international police operation, the A-CFSEU was awarded on October 16, 2006 the prestigious Motorola Webber Seavey Award for Quality in Law Enforcement at the IACP Annual Conference in Boston. The award recognizes innovative policing programs that can serve as models for law enforcement agencies worldwide. = The Norbourg case = On June 18, 2008, Montréal RCMP confirmed the conclusion of its investigation into criminal wrongdoings that affected approximately 9,200 shareholders of mutual funds managed by Norbourg. This criminal investigation showed that six persons allegedly participated in or facilitated the commission of fraud offences for a total of approximately 95 million dollars. This investigation conducted by the Integrated Market Enforcement Team (IMET) led to the arrest of six persons with close ties to Norbourg, including Norbourg CEO Vincent Lacroix. The six suspects were charged with conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to commit forgery, forgery, fraud and money laundering. The crimes for which the suspects were charged were allegedly committed between September 20, 2002, and August 25, 2005. A total of 922 counts of indictment were laid as a result of this IMET criminal investigation. This investigation was a strategic priority intended not only to establish the alleged wrongdoings, but also to prove the criminal intent of the perpetrators. It was launched on the basis of a search of Norbourgs business premises carried out on August 25, 2005. The search led to the seizure and analysis of approximately 1,500 boxes containing more than one million miscellaneous documents and millions of computer files. The criminal investigation focussed on the analysis of 125 questionable transactions from which the IMET identified 112 alleged misappropriations of funds recorded between 2002 and 2005. The evidence gathered as part of the IMET investigation also demonstrated that the accused developed and implemented a system by which documents were allegedly forged and used to conceal evidence of misappropriation of funds and the origin of those funds, enabling Vincent Lacroix to make a number of personal and corporate acquisitions.  Commitment to communities and employees  In addition to conducting investigations, RCMP members also strive to attend a variety of community and multicultural events. The commitment of \\"C\\" Division to regional events includes various educational initiatives, charitable activities and national/international conferences. = Healthy Enterprise – Elite Certification = In 2012, the RCMP was awarded the Healthy Enterprise – Elite certification by the Bureau de normalisation du Québec (BNQ).Bureau de normalisation du Québec - \\"C\\" Division Certificate http://www- es.criq.qc.ca/pls/owa_es/bnqw_entr_enr.affiche_cert_es?p_lang=en&p;_nom_entr=&p;_munic=&p;_regi_adm=&p;_prov=&p;_pays=&p;_sic=&p;_nace=&p;_norme=BNQ%209700-800/2008-02-25&p;_no_cert=44992-1-01 Through this certification, the BNQ acknowledged the commitment made by “C” Division to take concrete action to better the health and wellness of its employees.).The Healthy Enterprises Group - Elite Certification http://www.groupeentreprisesensante.com/coming-soon.html The RCMP is the first federal agency and the first police force in Canada to be awarded this certification. The BNQ praised the RCMP for the quality of its infrastructure, including fitness facilities in almost all of its detachments, and for taking steps to promote healthy living among its employees. The RCMP is now part of a group of only 14 businesses and organizations in Quebec boasting the Healthy Enterprise – Elite certification.BNQ - List of Certificates and Attestations http://www- es.criq.qc.ca/pls/owa_es/bnqw_entr_enr.liste_enr?p_lang=en&p;_type_bnq=ES&p;_nom_entr=&p;_munic=&p;_regi_adm=&p;_code_ics=&p;_prov=&p;_pays=&p;_sic=&p;_nace=&p;_norme=BNQ%209700-800/2008-02-25&p;_id_prog_certif=&p;_id_prog_certif2=&p;_produit=  International Peace Operations  RCMP officer in Haiti Since 1989, Canada has deployed police officers to international peace missions around the world. They assist in rebuilding and strengthening police services in countries that have experienced conflict or upheaval. The RCMP manages the deployment of Canadian police, including planning and evaluating missions, selecting and training personnel from across the country as well as providing support throughout deployment. Canadian police who serve abroad come from municipal, provincial and regional police forces as well as the RCMP, and represent a variety of backgrounds.  \\"C\\" Division Ceremonial Troop  Created in 1988, the RCMP Ceremonial Troop is composed of volunteers posted to various sections in \\"C\\" Division.

Etymology The specific name is taken from the Latin words venter (\\"belly\\"), and flavus (\\"yellow\\"), referring to the coloration of the species' ventral surfaces. Discovery Specimens of the species were discovered in October 2012, during a survey conducted for the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute. The population was described as a new species, separate from the nearby Telmatobius intermedius and T. rimac, in the journal ZooKeys in February 2015. The discovery of the species was unusual, in that the surrounding area is generally considered \\"species-poor\\", and already has two species of Telmatobius frogs nearby (T. rimac to the north and T. intermedius to the south). Furthermore, the type locality is easily accessible, being in proximity to the highway that connects the city of Ayacucho with the Pan- American Highway. Description Anterior view The species is slender. Females measure in length and weigh , while males measure approximately and weigh . The head is flat, wider than long, and makes up slightly more than 30% of the body length. T. ventriflavum has large eyes and a rounded snout; the tongue is rounded and the species lacks vocal slits. T. ventriflavum lacks webbing on its fingers but has webbing on its toes. Its skin is smooth both ventrally (below) and dorsally (above), but the back is patterned with miniature pustules. Coloration on the dorsal portion of the body ranges from light golden-yellow to golden-tan, with dark brown, golden-yellow, and red mottling. The sides are tan yellow, fading into golden-yellow or marigold on the throat and belly with depigmented areas on the chest. Coloration of the limbs varies between sexes: in males the ventral surface is bright marigold or orange colored, whereas in females it tends to be either golden-yellow or light marigold. The species has thin turquoise rings around the eyes, which are light grey in color. Range and habitat The species is found around elevations of (possibly up to ) on the Pacific (western) slopes of the Andes in Peru. Specimens have only been collected from a single locality, a stream that drains into the Huaytará river, a tributary of the Pisco river. The surrounding area is sparse, arid Puna grassland. Most rainfall occurs between January and March. T. ventriflavum was found in a small stream, approximately wide. The stream alternates between gravel- and pebble-bedded pools and small waterfalls and riffles. The species' range is restricted by the surrounding environment, which is arid and limits dispersal. Reproduction The species is believed to have an extended breeding period, with the developmental stages of captured tadpoles suggesting that it even breeds during the dry period. Threats T. ventriflavum's habitat is truncated by a dam and reservoir downstream of the type locality. The construction of pipelines and roads are also a threat, as is water contamination stemming from nearby mining and agriculture. The species has also been observed to be infected with the pathogenic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, which causes the disease chytridiomycosis. Infection rates were approximately 40.0% among mature specimens and 53.5% among tadpoles. B. dendrobatidis has had catastrophic effects on other Telmatobius species throughout the Andes region of South America: the extinction of three species from Ecuador has been linked to chytridiomycosis outbreaks, as has the decline of T. marmoratus and T. timens from Peru and three species from Argentina. T. jelskii from Peru and T. gigas from Bolivia have also been affected by the fungus.

His father was Tadc, son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster, which meant that Domnall was a member of the Meic Taidc, a branch of the Uí Briain. Domnall's mother was Mór, daughter of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles, which may have given Domnall a stake to the kingship of the Isles. In 1094, Domnall's uncle, Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland, drove Gofraid Crobán, King of Dublin and the Isles from Dublin, and may have replaced him with Domnall himself. Certainly at some point following Gofraid's death in 1095, Muirchertach installed Domnall as King of the Isles. The latter's reign was short-lived however, and Domnall appears to have been forced from the Isles prior to its subsequent conquest by the King of Norway. In 1111, Domnall evidently seized the kingship of the Isles by force. It is uncertain whether he enjoyed Uí Briain support in this venture. Several years later, at a time when his aforesaid uncle was gravely ill, Domnall was again active in Ireland. Although he may have openly left the Isles to take advantage of his uncle's demise, it is also possible he was forced out by the Islesmen. Domnall was slain in 1115, apparently at the hands of Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht. Familial origins Locations relating to Domnall's life and times. Domnall was a son of Tadc, son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster.Ní Mhaonaigh (2018) p. 146 n. 83; Casey (2013) p. 147 fig. 2; Candon (2006) pp. 116, 117 fig. 4; Byrne (2001) p. 297 tab. 17; Duffy (1993a) p. 30; Duffy (1992) pp. 104–105, 105 n. 59; Kelleher (1988) p. 26 tab. Domnall was, therefore, a member of the Meic Taidc.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 445; Oram (2000) p. 20; Duffy (1992) p. 105. According to the twelfth-century Banshenchas, Domnall's father married Mór, daughter of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles. This source specifies that the couple had three sons and a daughter: Amlaíb, Bé Binn, Donnchad, and Domnall himself.Downham (2017) p. 100 n. 62; Downham (2013) p. 147; Duffy (2002) p. 55, 55 n. 7; Duffy (1993a) p. 34, 34 n. 16; Duffy (1992) p. 105, 105 n. 59; Candon (1988) p. 403; Dobbs (1931) pp. 196, 229. Uí Briain intervention in Dublin Toirdelbach Ua Briain died in 1086, and the Kingdom of Munster was partitioned between his three surviving sons: Muirchertach, Diarmait, and Tadc. The latter expired only a month after his father, after which Muirchertach drove Diarmait from Munster altogether, seizing the kingship for himself. Muirchertach then embarked upon extending his authority throughout Ireland.Duffy (2005). During this period, Muirchertach not only had to contend with the opposing forces of his surviving brother,Duffy (2005); Duffy (1992) pp. 104–105. but also those of the Meic Taidc, the sons of his deceased brother. In 1091, however, the Meic Taidc appear to have come to terms with Muirchertach—at least temporarily—as the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters reports that a peace was agreed between him and the Meic Taidc, who are nonetheless said to have acted treacherously towards Muirchertach's men.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) § 1091.10; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) § 1091.10; Duffy (1993a) p. 34; Duffy (1992) p. 105, 105 n. 58; Candon (1988) p. 404. Although Muirchertach appears to have regained control of the Kingdom of Dublin by 1090, he soon after lost it to Gofraid Crobán, King of the Isles, until he forced the latter from the kingship of Dublin once and for all in 1094.Duffy (1992) pp. 106–108. It may have been at this point that Muirchertach installed his son, Domnall Gerrlámhach, to the kingship.MacCotter (2017); Flanagan (2008) p. 907. Another possibility, however, is that Muirchertach instead appointed Domnall himself after Gofraid's expulsion.Bracken (2004a). Meic Taidc interference in the Isles Gofraid died in the Hebrides the year after his expulsion from Dublin.Ní Mhaonaigh (2018) p. 146; Duffy (2006a) p. 63; Duffy (2004b). Whether this is evidence that he had been driven from Mann is uncertain.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 235; Oram (2000) p. 20; Duffy (1993a) pp. 35–36; Duffy (1993b) p. 16. According to the thirteenth- to fourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann, Gofraid was succeeded in the Isles by his eldest son, Lagmann,McDonald (2019) p. 23; Oram (2011) p. 48; Oram (2000) pp. 20–21; Candon (1988) p. 404; Power (1986) p. 116; Anderson (1922) p. 98; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 54–55. who appears to have been forced to fend off factions supporting the claims of his younger brothers.Oram (2011) p. 48; Duffy (2004b); Oram (2000) p. 21. At some point, the chronicle claims that the leading Islesmen sought assistance of Muirchertach, and petitioned him to provide a regent from his own kin to govern the kingdom until Lagmann's younger brother, Amlaíb mac Gofraid, was old enough to assume control.Ní Mhaonaigh (2018) p. 146, 146 n. 83; Oram (2011) p. 48; Duffy (2009) p. 296; Candon (2006) p. 116; Duffy (2006a) pp. 62–63; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 235–236; Power (2005) pp. 11–12; Bracken (2004a); Duffy (2002) p. 57; Holland (2000) pp. 128, 128–129 n. 79; Oram (2000) p. 21; Duffy (1997) p. 43; Ní Mhaonaigh (1995) p. 375; Ó Cuív (1994) p. 116; Duffy (1993a) p. 36; Duffy (1993b) p. 16; Duffy (1992) pp. 108–110; Power (1986) p. 115; Anderson (1922) p. 100; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 54–55. The chronicle's account could be evidence that, by about 1096, Lagmann faced a faction formed around his younger brother; and that, when this faction was unable to topple Lagmann by itself, it approached Muirchertach for assistance in placing Amlaíb mac Gofraid upon the throne.Oram (2011) p. 48; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 235–236; Oram (2000) p. 21. Muirchertach was certainly a formidable potential ally, having recently imposed his dominance over the kingdoms of Connacht, Leinster, Mide, and Dublin.Oram (2011) p. 48; Flanagan (2008) p. 909; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 235; Bracken (2004). In consequence of this predominance, the clause as stated by the chronicle—that Muirchertach was to provide the Isles with a regent from his own kin—may well have been a condition on his intervention, rather than a request of the Islesmen themselves.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 235–236; Oram (2000) p. 21; Anderson (1922) pp. 100–101; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 54–55. Whatever the case, the chronicle reveals that Muirchertach then installed Domnall upon the throne.Ní Mhaonaigh (2018) p. 146, 146 n. 83; Oram (2011) p. 48; Duffy (2009) p. 296; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 236; Power (2005) pp. 11–12; Bracken (2004a); Duffy (2002) p. 57, 57 n. 11; Oram (2000) p. 21; Duffy (1997) p. 43; Duffy (1993a) p. 36, 36 n. 25; Duffy (1992) pp. 108–110; Anderson (1922) pp. 100–101; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 54–55. Excerpt from folio 458v of Royal Irish Academy C iii 3 (the Annals of the Four Masters) concerning the death of Domnall's brother, Amlaíb, in 1096.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) § 1096.8; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) § 1096.8. Although Domnall had earlier opposed Muirchertach over the kingship of Munster, he possessed strong familial connections with the Isles through his maternal descent from Echmarcach.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 236; Duffy (1992) p. 109. In fact, the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster reveals that at least two apparent members of Echmarcach's family were killed less than a decade before in a repulsed invasion of Mann.The Annals of Ulster (2012) § 1087.7; Oram (2011) p. 32; The Annals of Ulster (2008) § 1087.7; Duffy (2006a) p. 62; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 233, 236; Duffy (2002) p. 55; Oram (2000) pp. 19–20; Duffy (1993a) p. 34; Duffy (1992) pp. 105, 109; Candon (1988) pp. 403–404. As a result of their demise, Domnall may well have become the leading male representative of his mother's family.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 236; Oram (2000) p. 21; Duffy (1992) p. 109. From the standpoint of the Uí Briain, the union of Domnall's parents would, therefore, seem to have been orchestrated in the context of extending Uí Briain authority into the Isles.Candon (2006) p. 116; Candon (1988) p. 404. In 1096, the Annals of the Four Masters reveals that Domnall's brother, Amlaíb, lost his life on Mann,Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) § 1096.8; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) § 1096.8; Ó Corráin (2010) p. 225; Candon (2006) p. 116; Duffy (2006a) p. 64; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 236; Power (2005) pp. 11–12; Duffy (2002) pp. 55, 57; Duffy (1997) p. 43; Duffy (1993a) pp. 34, 36; Duffy (1992) p. 109; Candon (1988) p. 404; Anderson (1922) p. 99. apparently whilst supporting Domnall's undertaking in the Isles.Duffy (2006a) p. 64; Duffy (2002) p. 57; Duffy (1993a) p. 36. This source not only corroborates Uí Briain intervention in the Isles,Duffy (2002) p. 57; Duffy (1993b) p. 16. but suggests that Domnall and the rest of the Meic Taidc faced significant opposition there,Candon (2006) p. 116; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 236. possibly in the form of Lagmann's adherents.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 236. The chronicle credits Domnall with an oppressive three-year reign that ended when the leading Islesmen revolted against him, and drove him from the kingdom back to Ireland.Ní Mhaonaigh (2018) p. 146, 146 n. 84; Candon (2006) p. 116; Duffy (2006a) p. 62; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 236; Power (2005) pp. 11–12; Candon (1988) p. 404; Power (1986) p. 115; Anderson (1922) p. 101; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 54–55. Norwegian ascendancy in Dublin and the Isles Storm (1899) p. 544. The extent of Domnall's rule in the kingdom is unknown, and it is questionable whether he had any real authority in the northern Hebrides, furthest from Mann.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 236; Oram (2000) p. 21. In about 1097, Magnús Óláfsson, King of Norway sent a delegate named Ingimundr into the Isles to take possession of the kingdom. After installing himself on Lewis, Ingimundr was overthrown and killed whilst attempting to usurp the kingship.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 236; Oram (2000) p. 21; Power (1986) pp. 115–116. Ingimundr's rationale for seating himself upon an island on the edge of the kingdom may have been due to the fact that he was unable to gain any authority on Mann itself.Power (1986) p. 116. In fact, the chronicle reveals that civil war erupted there the following year,Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 236; Oram (2000) p. 21; Power (1986) pp. 118–119; Anderson (1922) pp. 101–102; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 56–57. and the chronicler Orderic Vitalis indicates that Mann was devastated to point of being a virtual desert by the time Magnús appeared on the scene.Power (2005) p. 13; Power (1986) p. 119; Forester (1854) p. 217; Le Prevost (1852) p. 29. The warring itself may have been related to the aforesaid factional struggles between Gofraid's sons.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 236; Oram (2000) p. 21; Power (1986) pp. 118–119. Although it is possible that it was Magnús who actually forced Domnall from the Isles,Candon (2006) p. 116. the fact the chronicle makes no mention of Domnall during the recorded conflict on Mann may be evidence that he had lost control of the island by then. Within the year, Magnús himself arrived in the Isles, captured Lagmann, and conquered the kingdom.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 236–240; Power (2005) pp. 12–14; Duffy (2002) pp. 57–58; Oram (2000) pp. 41–42. After overwintering in region, the Norwegian king left for Scandinavia in the summer, only to make his return nearly four years later, in 1102 or 1103.Oram (2011) p. 51; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 239; Holland (2000) p. 129; Oram (2000) p. 43. Once re-established on Mann, Magnús may well have seized control of Dublin before entering into an alliance with Muirchertach, formalised through the marriage between Magnús's young son, Sigurðr, and Muirchertach's daughter, Bjaðmunjo.Ní Mhaonaigh (2018) pp. 146–147; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 239–240; Bracken (2004a); Duffy (2002) pp. 58–59; Holland (2000) pp. 129–130, 130 n. 86; Oram (2000) p. 43; Duffy (1997) p. 43; Ní Mhaonaigh (1995) p. 375, 375 n. 71; Duffy (1993a) pp. 37–38; Duffy (1992) pp. 110–112; Candon (1988) pp. 406–407; Power (1986) pp. 125–126. The arrangement seems to reveal that Magnús intended for Sigurðr to rule over his recently-won territories.Oram (2011) p. 51; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 239; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 190; Helle (2003) p. 207; Oram (2000) p. 43; Duffy (1993a) p. 13. Although it may have also meant that Norwegian sovereignty in the Isles was recognised by the Irish,Candon (1988) p. 406. it is also possible that Muirchertach intended to exert his own influence into the region through his new son-in-law.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 239–240; Power (2005) p. 17; Duffy (2002) p. 59; Oram (2000) p. 43; Duffy (1993a) p. 38; Duffy (1993b) p. 16. Unfortunately for Muirchertach, and his long-term ambitions in Ireland and the Isles, Magnús was slain in Ulster in 1103,Oram (2011) p. 51; Byrne (2008) pp. 898; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 239–240; Power (2005) p. 17; Duffy (2002) p. 59; Oram (2000) pp. 43–44; Duffy (1993a) p. 38. whereupon Sigurðr immediately repudiated his bride and returned to Norway.Oram (2011) p. 51; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 240; Power (2005) p. 17; Duffy (2002) p. 59; Duffy (1993a) p. 38. Although Muirchertach was able to regain control of Dublin, and still held considerable influence in the Isles, Magnús' death appears to have left a power vacuum in the region that he was unable to fill.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 239–240; Oram (2000) p. 44. Restoration in the Isles; death in Ireland Excerpt from folio 33r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 503 (the Annals of Inisfallen) concerning Domnall's invasion of the Isles in 1111.Annals of Inisfallen (2010) § 1111.5; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) § 1111.5. In 1111, according to the eleventh- to fourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen, Domnall mac Taidc seized the kingship of the Isles by force.Annals of Inisfallen (2010) § 1111.5; Ó Corráin (2010) p. 225; Duffy (2009) p. 296; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) § 1111.5; Duffy (2006a) p. 64; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 5; Duffy (2002) pp. 57, 57 n. 13, 59; McLeod (2002) p. 30; Etchingham (2001) p. 151; Oram (2000) pp. 58–59; Duffy (1997) p. 43; Ó Cuív (1994) p. 116; Duffy (1993a) pp. 30, 36 n. 27; Duffy (1992) pp. 114–115; Candon (1988) pp. 405, 407; Power (1986) p. 116; Anderson (1922) p. 143. This annal-entry is the only notice of Domnall's lordship in the Isles preserved by Irish sources. This could indicate that the chronicle's aforesaid account of the petitioning of Muirchertach is incorrectly dated, and actually refers to about 1111. However, the fact that the chronicle places the petitioning during a period of new- found Uí Briain dominance in the region, before Magnús' arrival in the Isles, and at about the same time as Amlaíb's death, suggests that the chronicle's chronology concerning these events is sound, and that Domnall's seizure of the kingship in 1111 was indeed a return to the Isles.Duffy (1992) p. 109 n. 78. Domnall's name as it appears on folio 48r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 489 (the Annals of Ulster).The Annals of Ulster (2012) § 1115.5; The Annals of Ulster (2008) § 1115.5. There is uncertainty as to whether Domnall was supported in his venture by the rest of the Uí Briain. Although it is possible that he enjoyed backing from Muirchertach himself,Hudson, BT (2005) p. 5; Candon (2000); Candon (1988) pp. 405, 407. the fact that the Annals of the Four Masters states that Muirchertach had Domnall imprisoned three years before could be evidence that Domnall had made his move into the Isles without Muirchertach's consent.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) § 1107.9; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) § 1107.9; Duffy (2002) p. 59; Etchingham (2001) p. 151; Oram (2000) pp. 58–59; Duffy (1993a) p. 39; Duffy (1992) pp. 114–115; Candon (1988) pp. 401, 404. The annal-entry concerning Domnall's seizure of the Isles reveals that Domnall launched his campaign from northern Ireland,Annals of Inisfallen (2010) § 1111.5; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) § 1111.5; Duffy (2002) p. 59; Duffy (1993a) p. 39; Duffy (1992) pp. 114–115; Anderson (1922) p. 143. and a further entry in the same source shows that Dublin was occupied by Muirchertach for about three months, the very year of Domnall's campaign.Annals of Inisfallen (2010) § 1111.8; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) § 1111.8; Duffy (2002) p. 59; Etchingham (2001) p. 151; Duffy (1997) p. 43; Duffy (1993a) p. 39; Duffy (1992) pp. 114–115; Candon (1988) pp. 401, 405, 407. These records appear to indicate that Domnall was aided in his undertaking in the Isles by Muirchertach's northern opponents, and that Muirchertach occupied the town as means to directly counter Domnall's campaign, and deny him any support from the Dubliners.Duffy (2002) p. 59; Oram (2000) p. 59; Duffy (1993a) p. 39; Duffy (1992) pp. 114–115. In fact, Domnall may well have been supported in the Isles by Domnall Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain,Oram (2011) p. 51. a northern monarch who was not only Muirchertach's principal rival, but the representative of a family with a long history of involvement in the region.Oram (2011) p. 51; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 239. Excerpt from folio 34r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 503 concerning Domnall's death at the hands of the Connachta in 1115.Annals of Inisfallen (2010) § 1115.9; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) § 1115.9. Not long after his intrusion into the Isles—perhaps in 1113Hudson, BT (2005) p. 5. or 1114Oram (2000) p. 59.—Domnall appears to have been either driven out by force, or drawn back to Ireland in an attempt to capitalise on Muirchertach's failing health.Duffy (2002) p. 60; Oram (2000) p. 59; Duffy (1992) p. 115. This would appear to have been about the point when Amlaíb mac Gofraid began his own forty-year reign in the Isles.Duffy (2002) p. 60; Oram (2000) p. 59; Sellar (2000) p. 191 n. 20; Duffy (1993a) pp. 39–40. The latter, who apparently spent a considerable part of his childhood at the court of Henry I, King of England,McDonald (2019) p. 23; Duffy (2006a) p. 64; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 202; Duffy (2002) p. 60; Oram (2000) p. 58; Duffy (1993a) pp. 39–40; Duffy (1992) p. 115. may well have enjoyed the English king's assistance in assuming control of the Isles,Hudson, BT (2005) p. 5; Duffy (2002) p. 60; Oram (2000) pp. 58–59; Duffy (1993a) pp. 39–40; Duffy (1992) p. 115. and perhaps precipitated Domnall's departure. Whatever the cause for Domnall's return to Ireland, he certainly predeceased his rival uncle, and was killed by Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht, as the Annals of Inisfallen, the sixteenth-century Annals of Loch Cé, the Annals of the Four Masters, the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach, the Annals of Ulster, and the fifteenth-century Mac Carthaigh's Book all report Domnall's death at the hands of the Connachta in 1115.Mac Carthaigh's Book (2016a) § 1115.1; Mac Carthaigh's Book (2016b) § 1115.1; The Annals of Tigernach (2016) § 1115.2; Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) § 1115.6; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) § 1115.6; Casey (2013) p. 159; Annals of Loch Cé (2008) § 1115.5; The Annals of Ulster (2012) § 1115.5; Annals of Inisfallen (2010) § 1115.9; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) § 1115.9; The Annals of Ulster (2008) § 1115.5; Duffy (2006b) p. 72; Annals of Loch Cé (2005) § 1115.5; Annals of Tigernach (2005) § 1115.2; Oram (2000) p. 59; Duffy (1992) p. 115; Power (1986) p. 116; Anderson (1922) p. 143, 143 n. 2. In fact, Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair had invaded Thomond earlier that year,Duffy (2006b) p. 72; O'Byrne (2005); Oram (2000) p. 59. and the Annals of Tigernach elaborates that he had installed Domnall as King of Thomond at that point. This source further reveals that Domnall had afterwards turned against Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, who in turn invaded Thomond and had Domnall eliminated.The Annals of Tigernach (2016) § 1115.2; Annals of Tigernach (2005) § 1115.2; Oram (2000) p. 59; Anderson (1922) p. 143, 143 n. 2.

Biography Born in Auckland on 18 March 1942, Lynch grew up in Auckland in the suburb of Papatoetoe and attended De La Salle College, Mangere East. He studied at the Catholic College of Education, Sydney, and became a religious brother of the De La Salle Order. Lynch went on to graduate from the University of Auckland with a Bachelor of Arts in 1972, and obtained a Diploma of Human Development from La Salle University in 1976, and a Diploma of Education from Massey University in 1977. Lynch taught at various Catholic schools between 1963 and 1993, and was principal of De La Salle College, Auckland, from 1979 to 1993. He served as president of the Secondary Principals Association of New Zealand (SPANZ) from 1992 until 1994, and then, while remaining a member of the De La Salle Brothers Community at Mangere East, chief executive of the New Zealand Catholic Education Office (NZCEO), a position he held for 21 years from 1994 until 2015. Around 86,000 students were enrolled in Catholic State-integrated schools in 2015. This represented 78% of all Catholic students and just under 10 percent of all students in the New Zealand school system. As the head of the NZCEO, Lynch was instrumental in promoting the national organisational development of the Catholic state integrated school system and also the creation of a national system to review and develop the \\"special character\\" of New Zealand Catholic schools (i.e. the religious dimension) in coordination with Education Review Office school reviews. He dealt with 15 different Ministers of Education during his tenure as chief executive. Honours In 1990, Lynch was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 1991 Queen's Birthday Honours, Lynch was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. In the 2015 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to education.

It is essentially basic substitution of variables, but allows for a change in the number of variables used. Definition The formal definition of plethystic substitution relies on the fact that the ring of symmetric functions \\\\Lambda_R(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots) is generated as an R-algebra by the power sum symmetric functions p_k=x_1^k+x_2^k+x_3^k+\\\\cdots. For any symmetric function f and any formal sum of monomials A=a_1+a_2+\\\\cdots, the plethystic substitution f[A] is the formal series obtained by making the substitutions p_k \\\\longrightarrow a_1^k+a_2^k+a_3^k+\\\\cdots in the decomposition of f as a polynomial in the pk's. Examples If X denotes the formal sum X=x_1+x_2+\\\\cdots, then f[X]=f(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots). One can write 1/(1-t) to denote the formal sum 1+t+t^2+t^3+\\\\cdots, and so the plethystic substitution f[1/(1-t)] is simply the result of setting x_i=t^{i-1} for each i. That is, f\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{1-t}\\\\right]=f(1,t,t^2,t^3,\\\\ldots). Plethystic substitution can also be used to change the number of variables: if X=x_1+x_2+\\\\cdots,x_n, then f[X]=f(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) is the corresponding symmetric function in the ring \\\\Lambda_R(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) of symmetric functions in n variables. Several other common substitutions are listed below. In all of the following examples, X=x_1+x_2+\\\\cdots and Y=y_1+y_2+\\\\cdots are formal sums. *If f is a homogeneous symmetric function of degree d, then f[tX]=t^d f(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots) *If f is a homogeneous symmetric function of degree d, then f[-X]=(-1)^d \\\\omega f(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots), where \\\\omega is the well-known involution on symmetric functions that sends a Schur function s_{\\\\lambda} to the conjugate Schur function s_{\\\\lambda^\\\\ast}. *The substitution S:f\\\\mapsto f[-X] is the antipode for the Hopf algebra structure on the Ring of symmetric functions. *p_n[X+Y]=p_n[X]+p_n[Y] *The map \\\\Delta: f\\\\mapsto f[X+Y] is the coproduct for the Hopf algebra structure on the ring of symmetric functions. *h_n\\\\left[X(1-t)\\\\right] is the alternating Frobenius series for the exterior algebra of the defining representation of the symmetric group, where h_n denotes the complete homogeneous symmetric function of degree n. *h_n\\\\left[X/(1-t)\\\\right] is the Frobenius series for the symmetric algebra of the defining representation of the symmetric group.

At any given X location it could draw two dots at given Y locations, making it suitable for producing two superimposed waveforms, line charts or histograms. Text and graphics could be mixed, and there were additional tools for drawing axes and markers. The waveform graphics system was used only for a short period of time before it was replaced by the more sophisticated ReGIS system, first introduced on the VT125 in 1981. ReGIS allowed the construction of arbitrary vectors and other shapes. Whereas DEC normally provided a backward compatible solution in newer terminal models, they did not choose to do this when ReGIS was introduced, and waveform graphics disappeared from later terminals. Description Waveform graphics was introduced on the VT55 terminal in October 1975, an era when memory was extremely expensive. Although it was technically possible to produce a bitmap display using a framebuffer using technology of the era, the memory needed to do so at a reasonable resolution was typically beyond the price point that made it practical. All sorts of systems were used to replace computer memory with other concepts, like the storage tubes used in the Tektronix 4010 terminals, or the zero memory racing-the-beam system used in the Atari 2600. DEC chose to attack this problem through a clever use of a small buffer representing only the vertical positions on the screen. Such a system could not draw arbitrary shapes, but would allow the display of graph data. The system was based on a 512 by 236 pixel display, producing 512 vertical columns along the X-axis, and 236 horizontal rows on the Y-axis. Y locations were counted up from the bottom, so the coordinate 0,0 was in the lower left, and 511, 235 in the upper right. Had this been implemented using a framebuffer with each location represented by a single bit, 512 ⨉ 236 x 1 = 120,832 bits, or 15,104 bytes, would have been required. At the time, memory cost about $50 per kilobyte,\\"Memory Prices (1957-2014)\\" so the buffer alone would cost over $700, . Instead, the waveform graphic system used one byte of memory for each X axis location, with the byte's value representing the Y location. This required only 512 bytes for each graph, a total of 1024 bytes for the two graphs. Drawing a line required the programmer to construct a series of Y locations and send them as individual points, the terminal could not connect the dots itself. To make this easier, the terminal automatically incremented the X location every time an Y coordinate was received, so a graph line could be sent as a long string of numbers for subsequent Y locations instead of having to repeatedly send the X location every time. Drawing normally started by sending a single instruction to set the initial X location, often 0 on the left, and then sending in data for the entire curve. The system also included storage for up to 512 markers on both lines. These were always drawn centered on the Y value of the line they were associated with, meaning that a simple on/off indication for X locations was all that was needed, requiring only 1024 bits, or 128 bytes, in total. The markers extended 16 pixels vertically, and could only be aligned on 16-pixel boundaries, so they were not necessarily centered across the underlying graph. Markers were used to indicate important points on the graph, where a symbol of some sort would normally be used. The system also allowed a vertical line to be drawn for every horizontal location and a horizontal one at every vertical location. These were also stored as simple on/off bits, requiring another 128 bytes of memory. These lines were used to draw axes and scale lines, or could be used for a screen-spanning crosshair cursor. A separate set of two 7-bit registers held additional information about the drawing style and other settings. Although complex from the user's perspective, this system was easy to implement in hardware. A cathode ray tube produces a display by scanning the screen in a series of horizontal motions, moving down one vertical line after each horizontal scan. At any given instant during this process, the display hardware examines a few memory locations to see if anything needs to be displayed. For instance, it can determine whether to draw a marker on graph 0 by examining register 1 to see if markers are turned on, looking in the marker buffer to see if there is a 1 at the current X location, and then examining the Y location of graph 0 to see if it is within 16 pixels of the current scan line. If all of these are true, a spot is drawn to present that portion of the marker. As this will be true for 16 vertical locations during the scanning process, a 16-pixel high marker will be drawn. Sold alone, the VT55 was priced at $2,496, . Like other models of the VT50 series, the terminal could be equipped with an optional wet-paper printer in a panel on the right of the screen. This added $800 to the price. DEC also offered VT55 in a package with a small model of the PDP-11 to create one model of the DEClab 11/03 system. The DEClab normally sold for $14,000, with an DECwriter II (LA36) printer, or $15,000, , with the VT55. The system had I/O channels for up to 15 lab devices, and included libraries for FORTRAN and BASIC for reading the data and creating graphs. The fairly extensive VT55 Programmers Manual covered the latter in depth. Commands and data Histogram mode fills in the area under the curve. This example illustrates why the system was called waveform graphics. Data was sent to the terminal using an extended set of codes similar to those introduced on the VT52. VT52 codes generally started with the character (octal 33, decimal 27) and was then followed by a single letter instruction. For instance, the string of four characters would reposition the cursor in the upper left (home) and then clear the screen from that point down. These codes were basically modeless; triggered by the the resulting escape mode automatically exited again when the command was complete. Escape codes could be interspersed with display text anywhere in the stream of data. In contrast, the graphics system was entirely modal, with escape sequences being sent to cause the terminal to enter or exit graph drawing mode. Data sent between these two codes were interpreted by the graphics hardware, so text and graphics could not be mixed in a single stream of instructions. Graphics mode was entered by sending the string , and exited again with the string . Even the commands within the graphics mode were modal; characters were interpreted as being additional data for the previous load character (command) until another load character is seen. Ten load characters were available: @ - no operation, used to tell the terminal the last command is no longer active A - load data into register 0, selecting the drawing mode for the two graphs I - load data into register 1, selecting other drawing options H - load the starting X position (Horizontal) for the following commands B - load data for Y locations for graph 0 starting at the H position selected earlier J - load data for Y locations for graph 1 starting at the H position selected earlier C - store a marker on graph 0 at the following X location K - store a marker on graph 1 at the following X location D - draw a horizontal line at the given Y location L - draw a vertical line at the given X location X and Y locations were sent as 10-bit decimal numbers, encoded as ASCII characters, with 5 bits per character. This means that any number within the 1024 number space (2) can be stored as a string of two characters. To ensure the characters can be transmitted over 7-bit links, the pattern 01 is placed in front of both 5-bit numbers, producing 7-bit ASCII values that are always within the printable range. This results in a somewhat complex encoding algorithm. For instance, if one wanted to encode the decimal value 102, first you convert that to the 10-bit decimal pattern 0010010010. That is then split that into upper and lower 5-bit parts, 00100 and 10010. Then append 01 binary to produce 7-bit numbers 0100100 and 0110010. Individually convert back to decimal 40 and 50, and then look up those characters in an ASCII chart, finding ( and 2. These have to be sent to the terminal least significant character first. If these were being used to set the X coordinate, the complete string would be . When used as X and Y locations for the graphs, extra digits were ignored. For instance, the 512 pixel X axis requires only 9 bits to encode, so the 10th bit was ignored. Likewise, Y locations ignored the 9th and 10th bits. Control registers always contained 7 bits, with the most significant bits always being 01. In register zero, bit 0 (least significant) turned the entire line drawing system on or off. Bits 1 and 2 turned the individual graphs 0 or 1 on or off, and bits 3 and 4 controlled whether graphs 0 and 1 were lines or filled in to make histograms. For instance, if one wanted to have both graphs on-screen, but graph 0 would be a histogram and graph 1 would be a line, the required bit pattern would be 0101111, the leading 01 being fixed, the next bit saying graph 1 is a line (0), the next that graph 0 is a histogram (1), that both graphs are on (11) and that the entire graphics system is enabled (1). The resulting pattern is equivalent to decimal 47, the / character. This mode would be enabled with the string . The I register was loaded using similar encoding, but the bits controlled the display of markers and the horizontal and vertical lines. As with A, the most significant bits were always 01, the least significant bit turned on or off horizontal lines, bit 1 the same for vertical, 2 and 3 whether or not to display markers on graph 0 or 1 respectively, and setting bit 5 would clear out all the data for the markers and lines. That meant that one could clear the display by sending the bit pattern 0110000, decimal 48, the character 0. This produces the easily readable command . Markers and lines required only one coordinate to be sent, an X or Y. In the case of a marker, the Y location was defined by the data previously set with B or J. For lines, the second coordinate spanned the screen. For instance, a vertical line could be placed at location 102 on the X axis with the string . Both markers and lines could be cleared by setting bit 5 of the third character, which would otherwise be unused. Example The following example produces a simple graphic: \`ESC1A'I?B1111111111111111H (J6666666666666666C$09K$8D+723L 0?? 8\` The first two characters tell the terminal to enter graphics mode, while the next four set the two drawing mode registers to turn on both graph lines, markers on both, and enables horizontal and vertical lines. The B followed by the string of 1's produces an 8-pixel horizontal line in the lower left of the screen drawn using graph 0. The X location starts at the default location 0, and moves over one location with every following data point, which always consists of two characters. There is no need to type B in again, the string is modal and the current command remains B until another is encountered. That occurs when the H is encountered, and the following two characters are used to move the starting X location to the center of the screen. This is followed by a second line segment being drawn in graph 1 using the J. Two markers are then added, one on each line, centered along the segments. The line segments are 16 pixels wide and the markers are always 16 high. The result are cross shapes, one in the lower left and another centered. As the markers are centered on 16-pixel boundaries and cannot be drawn outside the visible area, the first marker on the lower segment will appear above the line, creating an upside-down T shape rather than a cross. The last two commands, D and L, produce two horizontal lines at the bottom and center of the screen, and three vertical lines at the left, center and right. At this point the terminal is still in graph drawing mode. One could turn graph 1 into a histogram by sending \`A7\`, causing a vertical bar to be drawn extending down from the center of the screen. Sending \`ESC2\` would exit graphics mode, at which point further characters are interpreted as normal text. VT105 changes The VT105 was broadly similar to the VT55, but added a number of additional features. One was a square format mode that reduced the display horizontally by eight character widths and extended it vertically by one line to make it more square than the original layout. This left additional room on the left for eight characters instead of a single vertical column, improving label displays. The VT105 also changed the meaning of register 0's bits slightly; bit 1 and 2 no longer turned on and off the entire graph, but the display of the graph points themselves. This allowed the display to make a line, a shaded histogram, or a histogram with a brighter line on top. In comparison, on the VT55 the graph bit controlled the display of the entire dataset, not just the line itself, so turning off the graph bit would make the histogram disappear as well. Another change was to re-use the @ command, formerly the \`noop\`, to allow a new Y position to be sent in as the shade line. This worked in conjunction with the histogram to allow the direction of the filling to be changed. On the VT55 the filling always drew down from the graph to the base of the display, on the VT105 with the shade line set, this could be set to draw up to the top of the screen, or more commonly, towards a center-point in the data. For instance, with the shade line set to the middle of the screen, if a sine wave was plotted the areas above the center would be shaded downwards and the sections below center upwards, producing a filled-in waveform. Enabling a horizontal line at the same point adds a visual baseline. There were two shade lines in memory, one for each graph, but only one @ command. A bit in register 1 controlled which of the two buffers the @ data was loaded into. Another major addition was the concept of strip graphs, a mode that emulated paper pen plotters that moved up and down while the paper was wound under them. These were commonly used for recording scientific data, but are perhaps best known on older lie detectors. As new data points were added to one of the graphs, previous data was shifted to the left. Thus, sending a series of Y values using B or J would first cause the line to be drawn from the left to right like the VT55, but additional data points would push the previous data to the left. If markers or vertical axis lines were set, they too were pushed over, following the data. In dual strip mode, adding data to graph 1 caused both graphs to move over at the same time. All of these new features were controlled through optional second characters added to the A and I commands. The first data character worked as it had under the VT55, and thus provided backward compatibility. The second turned on the new features. The second character sent to the A controlled shading lines and the strip-chart feature; least significant bit, bit 0, set the shade line data sent with @ to be loaded into graph 0 or graph 1, while bits 2 and 3 turned the shade line on or off for graph 0 or 1, respectively. Turning on bit 3 allowed strip charts to be used, while bit 4 turned it on for both graphs, the dual strip feature. The second character on the I command had only two values, ! or space; sending ! put the terminal into square mode, while space, or nothing, left it in the VT55 compatible rectangle format. Other details The VT50 series also included an alternate character set, graphics mode, that could be switched in and out while in text mode. These were used to provide additional glyphs useful for labeling and similar tasks. Among the characters were subscript 0 through 9 and the upper part of fractions 1/, 2/, 3/, 5/ and 7/. These could be combined to form, for instance, . The set also included horizontal bars at each of the 8 scan lines in a normal glyph, the degree symbol, and other common examples. These used separate character codes, so graphics characters could be mixed with the normal character set on a single screen.

He was notable as the compiler of Biographie Universelle (1811-). He became a lieutenant on July 15, 1791 and joined the Zweibrücken Regiment. In 1792 he participated in the Battle of Valmy and the Battle of Jemappes. Having reached the rank of captain in the 102nd line regiment, he left the army for health reasons. In 1797, with his brother Joseph François Michaud and N. Giguet (died in 1810), he founded a (at first clandestine) printing press, specializing in books about religion and the monarchy. He was imprisoned with his brother and N. Giguet for several months in 1799 for having printed anti-Bonapartist literature. He obtained his first commission from abbot Jacques Delille, then a refugee in London, who entrusted him with his books to be printed. Universal Biography In 1802 he published a biography of many notable individuals at the end of the 18th century and early 19th century. He described their ranks, their jobs, their talents, their writings, their troubles, their virtues, or their crimes in 4 volumes. Allegedly, it was copied in Breslau and Leipzig, which led to the failure of the project and his bankruptcy. It is probably this experience that led him eventually to consider the Ancient and Modern Universal Biography. His brother helped him at the onset, and many other authors contributed also. He was nominated printer in January 1811 and bookseller in October 1812. In 1823 he was appointed Director of the Royal Printing Press, but the appointment was brief. Michaud played a significant role in the return of Louis XVIII and expected a sinecure, but he was only rewarded with the Legion of Honour. He grew bitter and became opposed to the king's liberal policies. Michaud was author of historical books, in particular Historical Outline and Rationale of the First Wars of Bonaparte (1814). He was the editor of several newspapers and wrote prefaces to royalist books that he printed. He remains best known as the editor of the Universal Biography (1811-), to which he contributed numerous articles. He also assisted with the new much more extensive edition, which was not published until after his death. Works  Apart from numerous prefaces to works that he printed, Louis-Gabriel Michaud also published : *1802 : Biographie moderne ou des hommes vivants *1811 : Biographie universelle ancienne et moderne : histoire par ordre alphabétique de la vie publique et privée de tous les hommes, first edition in 85 volumes with supplements (1811-)archive.org *1814 : Tableau historique et raisonné des premières guerres de Bonaparte (Historical Outline and Rationale of the First Wars of Bonaparte). * 1843 : Biographie universelle ancienne et moderne : histoire par ordre alphabétique de la vie publique et privée de tous les hommes, 2nd edition in 45 vols. * 1851: The Public and Private Life of Louis Phillip of Orleans, Ex-king of France, translated by V.

It was produced by Mike Piccirillo and Gary Goetzman for Goetzman/Piccirillo Productions in association with Janice Marie Enterprises Inc. and included the minor R&B; hit Love Me Tonight. The album was recorded following the departure of Hazel Payne from A Taste of Honey in 1983 and after the commercial disappointment of their 1982 album, Ladies of the Eighties. The album was recorded and released due to contractual obligations made with Capitol Records. One Taste of Honey was released in the summer of 1984, but was a huge commercial disappointment. Jim Mazza, president of Capitol Records at the time, was very supportive of the album, although he was removed by the time the album was released. As a result, there were problems between Johnson and Capitol Records, including promotion and the lead single choice. Two singles were released, \\"Love Me Tonight\\" and \\"She's So Popular\\". \\"Love Me Tonight\\" reached #67 on the then- called Hot Black Singles chart in the United States, while \\"She's So Popular\\" was released internationally in an extended version and failed to chart. After the failure of the album, Capitol Records released the 1984 compilation, Golden Honey, to complete Johnson's contract with the record company. The compilation featured an unreleased song from the One Taste of Honey sessions, \\"I Want To Be Your Girl\\", which was also produced by Piccirillo & Goetzman, as well as a new extended remix of \\"Boogie Oogie Oogie\\" and six of A Taste of Honey's hits. Following this release, Janice-Marie Johnson and the A Taste of Honey act were dropped from Capitol Records and deficits were directed at her, forcing Johnson to file for bankruptcy and take on odd jobs, such as a limo driver. One Taste of Honey was released on LP and cassette, but has yet to be reissued on CD.

Since the legacy and the brand of the historic Croatian Peasant Party from the early 20th Century (led by Stjepan Radić and Vladko Maček) is popular and well-known, there have been couple of splinter groups and various parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina have a similar name, invoking CPP tradition.  History  CPP was found in 1993 as an effort led by Ivo Komšić and Napredak to create democratic opposition to HDZ policies. CPP joined HDZ 1990 and other minor Croat parties to form \\"Croats Together\\" coalition, challenging HDZ in 2006 elections. In 2007, CPP and the New Croatian Initiative merged. The New Croatian Initiative was formed earlier as a splinter group from the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Krešimir Zubak. The merger was originally named HSS-NHI (English: CPP-NCI). After CPP-NCI underwent turmoil and internal divisions grew, a division of former CPP members led by Ljiljana Lovrić left the party and reestablished Croatian Peasant Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2010. Weakened CPP joined HDZ and other minor center-right parties in a coalition to contest 2010 elections, opposed to the Croatian Coalition. In February 2017, party president Mario Karamatić said CPP will demand a reestablishment of Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia in its 1995 shape if the Republika Srpska secedes.\\"HSS will demand re-establishment of HR- HB in case of secession of RS\\", fena.ba, 22.02.2017.

Collin (born Richard Harvey Collin; March 4, 1932 – January 19, 2010, or January 20, 2010) was an American historian, university professor, food critic, and cookbook writer. He was notable for his research in the life and presidency of Theodore Roosevelt. Collin's contributions to Theodore Roosevelt scholarship included his dissertation, two monographs on Roosevelt, editing a book length collection of papers on the President, journal articles, and book reviews related to other writers' works on the President. His food writing, much of it written together with his wife Rima, included cookbooks and restaurant reviews. Early life and education Collin was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents were Bernard (\\"Barney\\") Collin, a self-taught master craftsman tool and die maker, and his mother was Esther Reubens Collin. Collin received his undergraduate degree (AB) from Kenyon College in 1954. At Kenyon College, Collin was an English major and belonged to the Middle Kenyon Association. During Collin's time in the Middle Kenyon Association, he became friends with fellow student, Kenyon graduate, and future novelist E.L. Doctorow. Collin received his PhD from New York University in 1966. The PhD was in American Civilization, and Collin wrote a dissertation on Theodore Roosevelt. Personal life Collin's parents were immigrants from England who settled in Philadelphia. According to the announcement published in the Philadelphia Inquirer, Collin became engaged to Frances Wene in 1954. He married Wene on August 15, 1954. They were divorced in 1969. . After their divorce, Wene married Robert H. Levy, an attorney. During the 1960s, Collin met his second wife, Rima Drell Reck, a professor of comparative literature at the University of New Orleans. They were married from 1969 until her death in 1998. After Reck's death in 1998, Collin wrote Travels with Rima (2002), a memoir of his life together with Reck. Two years after Reck's death, Collin met a widow, Phyllis Mayronne. Mayronne's late spouse, Harry Mayronne, Sr., had worked in advertising. According to Larson, the two shared a travel agent, and this agent introduced them to each other. Mayronne was to become Collin's partner during his last years. Fitzmorris writes that Collin and Mayronne met \\"on a European trip.\\" Career as historian and university professor Collin jointed the faculty at Louisiana State University in New Orleans in 1966. In 1974, the university underwent an official name change and became the University of New Orleans. Collin taught history and was a specialist on the life of Theodore Roosevelt. In his book Theodore Roosevelt: Culture, Diplomacy, and Expansion: A New View of American Imperialism, Collin seeks to correct the caricatured view of Roosevelt as the imperialist Rough Rider. Collin reminds his readers that Roosevelt was a man of various accomplishments, was well educated, sophisticated, was a published author, and who possessed considerable interests in science, literature, and fine arts. In addition, Collin argues that, during Roosevelt's presidency, the United States itself became more sophisticated and cosmopolitan. With changing mores in the 1960s, Collin went from being a conventional dresser in a business suit and a necktie to a more bohemian appearance, and he was known around the campus for wearing sandals and often wearing purple clothing. His love of purple extended to his car, as Collin owned a purple and white Cadillac, and, during the 1970s, Collin demonstrated his unconventionality by owning an Edsel. Collin maintained longtime friendships with his former University of New Orleans students, including Michael Ledet, an artist and book designer, and Tom Fitzmorris, a food critic. In an interview after Collin's death, Ledet stated that Collin \\"...was an eccentric, sweet man, an intellectual in every sense of the word... [and he] ...was my best friend for 45 years.\\" Collin enjoyed teaching and would sometimes don costumes in his classes. According to Ledet, Collin was a \\"magnificent teacher, very dramatic\\" and that the students \\"really loved him, a lot more than the restaurants did.\\" Food writer Collin was a restaurant critic, writing under the guise of the \\"Underground Gourmet.\\" In 1970, Collin heard about the \\"Underground Gourmet\\" series of restaurant guidebooks, published by Simon & Schuster. Collin wrote to the publisher, asking if they would be interested in a New Orleans version, and the publisher agreed. The contract was negotiated with the help of his first wife, Frances Collin, who is a literary agent. The resulting restaurant guide, The New Orleans Underground Gourmet, published in the summer of 1970, was \\"the first rated restaurant guide in the city's history.\\" According to Gene Bourg, a former restaurant critic at The Times-Picayune, Collin's book was successful for Simon & Schuster and it \\"...sold like hotcakes.\\" Another food writer Mary Tutwiler said that Collin had \\"...a cult following; one found his book, dog-eared and gravy stained, next to the phone book in houses all over the Crescent City. He was so witty, knowledgeable and influential...\\" Collin's book established him as the first New Orleans restaurant critic. Several months after Simon & Schuster published Collin's book, the New Orleans States-Item hired Collin to write a weekly restaurant column. Collin employed an elaborate rating system for the quality of food at various restaurants. For exceptionally good dishes, Collin used the phrase platonic dishes – a reference to Plato and the Socratic dialogue The Republic. Collin used the designation platonic dishes sparingly. Lesser culinary offerings received ratings of highly recommended or – for more prosaic menu items – recommended. From 1970–1980, Collin served as a columnist for the New Orleans States-Item and regularly published reviews of restaurants in New Orleans and the surrounding region. The regular newspaper column also bore the title Underground Gourmet. Collin reviews encompassed all sorts of restaurants and cuisines, including fine-dining establishments such as well as fast-food restaurants. He was especially enamored with Po-Boy sandwiches and wrote of them at length. Collin had an intense dislike of stuffed artichokes, a dish associated with Italian restaurants in New Orleans. Collin's work as a restaurant critic was not without controversy, however. If a restaurant received a favorable review, the restaurant owner was happy. If Collin gave an unfavorable review, restaurateurs complained, and one sent an angry letter to Collin's publisher, Simon and Schuster. Later, at a 1975 meeting of New Orleans restaurateurs, Collin's reviews \\"were subject to protest...\\", and these restaurateurs launched \\"...accusations that he lacked objectivity and, worse, that his wife, Rima Collin (also a UNO professor), had a professional interest in seeing some restaurants better rated than others.\\" Generally, however, Collin was complimentary about restaurants in New Orleans. In a 1975 interview, Collin discussed restaurants in France and in New Orleans. He asserted that \\"I think they're equal. I miss New Orleans when in France, and miss France when I'm in Orleans.\\" In the same interview, when he was asked if New Orleans restaurants were in decline, Collin stated, \\"New Orleans restaurants are not on the decline. There's as much good eating now as ever.\\" In one instance, a review from Collin resulted in a lawsuit. A restaurant owner, Donald James Mashburn, sued Collin, the newspaper, and the publisher for defamation over a pointed review of his restaurant, Maison de Mashburn, which was located near Hammond, Louisiana. Collin's inflammatory review appeared in the June 22, 1974 issue of the States-Item. Collin's review began with a mixture of harsh criticism and compliments with an emphasis on the former: :: \\"T'aint Creole, t'aint Cajun, t'aint French, t'aint country American, t'aint good. There's been a lot of fuss about this handsome new restaurant on the Covington-Hammond Rd. and more than the usual amount of letters telling me to try it. Mashburn's is an impressively setout restaurant located on a large and beautiful estate, in a fine 1907 house, with all of the amenities of a good European country inn. :: I don't know how much real talent in cooking is hidden under the melange of hideous sauces which make this food and the menu a travesty of pretentious amateurism but I find it all quite depressing. The line between genius and eccentricity is sometimes a thin one but at Mashburn's it is not really in doubt for very long... \\" The case made its way through the Louisiana state courts and ultimately was decided by the Louisiana Supreme Court, which issued a decision in favor of Collin on December 13, 1977. With his spouse, Rima Drell Reck, Collin wrote The New Orleans Cookbook (1975), The New Orleans Restaurant Guide (1976 edition), The Pleasures of Seafood (1977), and the 1982 edition of The New Orleans Restaurant Guide. The New Orleans Cookbook has gone through multiple printings, has sold at least 100,000 copies, and remains in print; Associated Press book critic Cecily Brownstone called it \\"one of the best regional contributions we are likely to have\\". Later years and death After Hurricane Katrina struck southern Louisiana in August 2005, Collin relocated to Birmingham, Alabama. Collin made periodic trips to New Orleans to eat at his favorite restaurants, and his last New Orleans appearance was at the 2008 Po-Boy Fest. He continued to reside in Birmingham until his death, however., from cancer. Legacy Although Collin was a history professor at the University of New Orleans for decades and known for scholarship on Theodore Roosevelt, he is more likely remembered for his food writing. Collin stopped writing restaurant criticism in the 1980s, but his work continued to influence later restaurant critics such as Tom Fitzmorris. Peggy Scott Laborde, a New Orleans documentary and television host, includes an interview of Collin in her 2001 public television documentary Lost Restaurants of New Orleans. The New Orleans Cookbook has gone through multiple printings and remains in print and The New Orleans Underground Gourmet, while out-of-print, remains a sought after book in second-hand bookstores and online auction sites. According to blogger Pontchartrain Pete, Collin's book is useful as a historical text, as it illustrates the New Orleans restaurant scene in the 1970s. According to Susan Tucker, an archivist and student of culinary history, Collin's books are \\"...remarkable scholarly editions with a good mix of practical culinary treasures...\\" and they \\"...remind us that food history and observations of foodways form a wonderful part of our heritage as scholars, cooks, and indeed as human beings.\\" As their food writing and research on New Orleans cuisine has remained influential, the 2010 Po-Boy Festival, a food festival in New Orleans, was dedicated to the memory of both Reck and Collin. Peggy Scott Laborde dedicated her television documentary New Orleans Restaurants with a Past to Collin's memory. Many of Collin's books, personal papers, and music compact discs are now housed at the Library of Southeastern Louisiana University. Collin's longtime friends Phyllis Mayronne and Michael Ledet were instrumental in bringing these materials to the University. This large collection reflects Collin's \\"wide-ranging interests.\\" When Collin resided in Birmingham, his books \\"were scattered throughout his condominium and had over- flowed into a 60-foot storage unit, filling shelves on both sides of the unit.\\" Among the items that Collin bequeathed to Southeastern University were \\"...more than 4,000 books on history, art, music and popular culture and 500 opera and vocal CDs. Also included are Collin’s collection of books and papers associated with President Theodore Roosevelt...\\" Another commentator stated that the bequest included, \\"a large number of coffee table books on artists and art movements, a collection of books and papers on Theodore Roosevelt along with Roosevelt memorabilia, cookbooks and books on food and drink, writings on culture and taste, classic literature, and many books on baseball, one of his passions.\\" At the time of their accession, the materials in the collection were valued at $100,000. In addition to the materials at Southeastern Louisiana University, the Nadine Vorhoff Library at Newcomb College holds over 400 books from Collin's personal collection. These deal with culinary history and other food-related topics. Professional memberships Collin was a member of the American Historical Association, the Organization of American Historians, the American Studies Association, and the Society of Historians of American Foreign Relations.

Designed to house prisoners either awaiting trial, transfer or serving short jail sentences, the structure handles both male and female inmates. The jail was constructed in 1990 after several delays and became best known in 2000 when a religious education program run by its chaplain was challenged and declared unconstitutional. At in height, the center is one of the tallest buildings in Fort Worth and the largest prison structure in the city. History The Tarrant County Corrections Center was constructed in 1990 because of overcrowding in nearby prisons. Completion of the prison was reportedly delayed by several causes, mainly issues with budgeting. Upon completion, the building was the first fully functional direct-supervision jail in Texas. Over 1,440 maximum-security prisoners were transferred from nearby facilities once the Corrections Center was opened, including female inmates. During its first few years, the facility was one of the best in the state; its warden reported that it had \\"not had one piece of graffiti written on the walls, one toilet stopped up, [or] one inmate struck or injured\\". A total of fifty dollars of a $20,000 budget was spent during the first year of operation, used for replacing two broken windows. The center's first incident occurred in 2005, when an inmate attacked two guards with an improvised shiv. The facility began suffering from overcrowding around 2010, so Fort Worth constructed a new jail, the Lon Evans Corrections Center, to handle more dangerous prisoners. =Chaplain's Education Unit= The Chaplain's Education Unit (CEU) was a religious educational program operated by the facility beginning in 1992. Originally a men's program, a women's branch was opened in 1993. The program, informally referred to as the \\"God Pod\\", was organized by the county sheriff and prison chaplain and run by a team of volunteers. It was designed to educate prisoners in Christian belief, based on the ideals believed by the sheriff and chaplain, which were meant to be \\"orthodox Christian principles\\". The program included up to 48 prisoners at a time, who were housed in a specialized area of the facility for a 120-day period. In 2000, two former prisoners and a local resident sued the Corrections Center, arguing that the program was a violation of religious freedom, since it allowed only for teaching of Christian principles. In 2001, the program was found to be unconstitutional, and was shut down. Facilities Designed by the Dallas-based HOK Architects, the Corrections Center is tall and has thirteen floors, making it one of only twenty-one structures in Fort Worth greater than tall. The building is designed in a postmodernist style, using buff-colored bricks, with cast stone as trimming. There are four jail pods located on each corner of the structure, with an outdoor recreational facility located between the east and west parts.

It is held in a private collection. In The Palace of Memories, René Magritte plunges the viewer into a scene of infinite mystery: underneath and beyond a theatre curtain is a vast, rocky landscape of crags stretching into the distance. Looking like a crater filled with lava and dominating that vista is a rock formation that resembles Magritte's images of chopped trees which would emerge in 1951 in The Work of Alexander.Mélusine. Merveilleux et surréalisme. Lausanne, 2000, p. 224. This introduces the theme of petrification that would recur in Magritte's art, the notion of the transformation between the elements as seen in his 1936 work, Le précurseur, in which a mountain range resembles an eagle. In The Palace of Memories, the pool of red within the crater adds another dimension to this switch between animal, vegetable and mineral. Meanwhile, against the curtain itself, hovering in the foreground, is a bunch of blue flowers which reminds us of some heraldic motif. This picture was formerly owned by Simon Harcourt-Smith, a diplomat and author whose father, Sir Cecil, had been the first director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, as well as a key advisor to the Royal Collection.The Art of the Surreal Evening Sale Christie's London. Retrieved 5 February 2015. The Palace of Memories was painted in 1939, and as such appears to be the first of a string of works in which Magritte explored the theme of the landscape behind a theatre curtain. Indeed, this marked a new entry of the curtain into Magritte's compositions: formerly, curtains tended to be shown either in the context of a window or as stand-alone objects in a landscape. This had been the case in The Poetic World, a work from the 1920s which Magritte had revisited, creating a new version for Edward James in 1937. Perhaps this had brought the theme of the curtain back to Magritte's mind. Certainly, in 1940, he would return to the stage curtain device in The Beauty of Night, in which a landscape reminiscent of the flatter parts of Belgium or of Holland is shown, allowing the sky to dominate the composition. Another oil from the same year, Le spectacle de la nature, shows another country scene beyond the curtain: two trees in a lush, verdant prairie; that picture is now in the Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich, where it forms part of the Theo Wormland Collection. In that picture, in place of the flowers in The Palace of Memories floats a solitary leaf. The fact that these pictures were signed by the artist in 1940 implies that The Palace of Memories, which was dated ‘1939’, may have been painted towards the end of that year. This was a momentous turning point in the life of Magritte and in the history of much of the world as well, as it marked the beginning of the Second World War. The Palace of Memories may thus date from after the declaration of war, yet before the invasion of Belgium and its subsequent Occupation, which began in May the following year. Perhaps, then, The Palace of Memories was painted against the backdrop of the drôle de guerre, the ‘Phoney War’, when little military action was taking place yet many of the nations of Europe were clearly pitted against each other. The Second World War would come to inspire Magritte to negotiate new means of representing his Surreal vision: he sought to respond to the conflict in a number of ways, often expunging any overbearing sense of the psychological oppression that was so naturally caused by it. In The Palace of Memories, by contrast, the sombre tone of the landscape underneath the curtain may hint at his own anxieties. At the same time, the theatrical posturing of the various nations may have helped to inspire the theatrical theme. In The Palace of Memories, the fact that the curtain implies some infinite theatre hints at a new way of looking at life itself. In this way, it chimes with Magritte's constant quest to bring about an epiphany in his viewers, to point them towards a new understanding of the magical and mysterious qualities of the world around us. Everything, Magritte appears to be saying, is spectacle. Everything is illusion.D. Sylvester & S. Whitfield, René Magritte, Catalogue raisonné, vol. II, Oil Paintings & Objects, 1931-1948, London 1993, no. 471, p. 275. Magritte's use of the curtain in this picture invoked a device that had been employed by a number of the Old Masters as a trompe-l'oeil way of drawing the viewer into the composition, pointing to the artifice of the scene, and also showcasing their own ability to paint something as lifelike as the drapery hanging in front of a picture; this was the case, for example, in several of the pictures of Johannes Vermeer. Magritte's play with the nature of the picture surface was given great scope by his use of similar devices, be it in the bunched stage curtain of The Palace of Memories, the velvet backdrop of The Plagiarism, pierced by the landscape-silhouette of the flowers dominating the composition, or even the numerous images of naked women next to long curtains such as La chambre de la fée and The Magnet. In those pictures, Magritte reintroduced the theme of the nude which he had explored in his earlier painting, Black Magic, but added this curtain element, playing with the various implied textures of the elements depicted. Magritte appears to have used the curtain device again and again after introducing it in The Palace of Memories. In it, he had found a means of adding a level of dialogue concerning the entire nature of art, of representation and of painting. By creating a perspectival landscape of seemingly colossal proportions in the background, with the curtain in the foreground, Magritte is deliberately bringing our attention to the entire process of imitation that underpins the act of painting itself. He is pointing to the artifice of his own profession, celebrating it. And the flowers floating in the foreground add a garnish, a flash of flair, that both emphasises and finalises this process of revelation.E.

It was designed by Andrea Giovanni Stombuco and built from 1884 to 1891. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  In July 1873, Joseph Wendelin Heckelmann purchased in Elizabeth Street from which he subdivided in 1878. In 1884 he erected a two storeyed business premises with cellars which Arthur S and Leopold S Benjamin, merchants, occupied and opened on 22 October 1884. A seven-year lease between the Benjamin Brothers and Heckelmann was formalised from September of that year at an annual rate of . The premises, which cost were designed by architect Andrea Stombuco and erected by W Watson. Built of stone and brick with a stuccoed facade, the building had a frontage of to Elizabeth Street and a depth of . A mechanical lift was incorporated in the building. Alterations occurred , but the majority of the building was destroyed by fire in December 1890. Using the original foundations and the ground floor facade, the building was re-erected in 1891 to a height of three storeys excluding basement. It is thought that architect John Jacob Cohen may have been responsible for the design of the renovations. Joseph Heckelmann caused his initials and the date of reconstruction to be noted in the frieze below each pediment. Heckelmann, a tinsmith by trade, was an alderman of the Hamilton Town Council at the time, having been elected in 1890. Benjamin Brothers did not re-establish in the building but long-term tenants such as soft goods manufacturer J Leutenegger occupied the site from 1895 to 1934. Leutenegger was also Swiss Consul for a time and the consulate office was in this building. Joseph Heckelmann died in 1925 and the ownership passed to his family. In April 1951 the building was purchased by the Commercial Bank of Australia for and continued to be leased. It was subdivided in 1963 and two years later one half of the building was bought by Kenneth Rosewall and Rodney G Laver, noted Australian sportsmen. The other portion remained in the hands of the Commercial Bank and its successor Westpac Banking Corporation. Kern Corporation subsequently became the owner of the entire building. =Street name= A number of street names in the Brisbane suburb of Carina Heights are identical to the surnames of prominent Queenslanders. One of these is Hecklemann Street.  Description  Different architectural styles on the ground and upper levels, 2015 Only the lower portion of the building's three level rendered brick facade can be attributed to the architect Andrea Stombuco. The upper two levels, which replaced Stombuco's single upper level, abandoned the arched openings of the original for a plainer trabeated construction. This has provided the building with a certain visual strength as the arched portion provides an apparent base for the upper levels of the building. The facade is treated as two identical sections corresponding to the building's original subdivisions. Each of these sections comprises three bays with the central one being narrower than the other two. Originally, on the lower level, the central bays had the broad arched doorway to each tenancy which were flanked by a pair of arched windows to each side, but the windows on the southern section of the facade have since been opened up to ground level. This early portion of the facade is ordered by unfluted Corinthian pilasters rising from a plinth at sill level to a plain string course. The upper two floors are linked by fluted giant order composite pilasters. The bay system is maintained with large rectangular windows in the flanking bays. As with the arched openings below, each window has its own framing pilasters. The parapet is a heavily decorated cornice which supports, over the central bay of each section, a highly ornate pediment, the northern one bearing the initials JWH, and the southern one carrying the date of the buildings reconstruction, 1891. Three square ornate urns mark the centre and ends of the building at parapet level. Decoration is rich but used in a discreet way and consists mainly of panels of foliage at points of emphasis. The facade is intact with the exception of window openings to the southern half which have been extended below the plinth at ground level, and re-glazed as large fixed panels to the upper levels. Internally, exposed trusses appear at the top level of the left hand bay. This side of the building also retains its timber post structure. The interior of the right hand bay has been covered by modern office partitioning and ceilings.  Heritage listing  Heckelmanns Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Heckelmanns Building is significant as a surviving element of the economic boom of the 1880s and the development of an Elizabeth Street commercial precinct. It is significant as part of an important streetscape including nearby Tara House. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Heckelmanns Building is characteristic of a Victorian era retail warehouse with its elaborate and ornate facade treatment. Heckelmanns Building is significant for the sympathetic rebuilding of the upper levels in relation to the original ground floor. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. This building is important for its association with owner Joseph Wendelin Heckelmann, successful businessman and local councillor; with notable Brisbane merchandising firm Benjamin Bros; and with long-term tenant J Leutenegger.

Origin The United Kingdom's Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal was instituted by King William IV in 1830. On 31 May 1895, Queen Victoria authorised the institution of territorial versions of the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, as well as of the Distinguished Conduct Medal and the Meritorious Service Medal, for the Dominions and Colonies. In 1910, King Edward VII instituted the Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal to replace the several territorial versions of the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal.Stephen Stratford Medals site - British Military & Criminal History - 1900 to 1999 - Army Long Service & Good Conduct Medal (Accessed 26 May 2015)South African Medal Website – Colonial Military Forces (Accessed 6 May 2015) (Accessed 26 May 2015) Institution On 23 September 1930, King George V cancelled the May 1895 Warrant of Queen Victoria in so far as it relates to the grant of medals for long service. Simultaneously, the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal as well as the Permanent Forces of the Empire Beyond the Seas Medal were replaced by the institution of the Medal for Long Service and Good Conduct (Military). The new medal was instituted as one medal to reward the long service and good conduct of warrant officers, non- commissioned officers and men of all the Permanent Forces of the Home Country and the Dominions, Colonies and Protectorates of the British Empire, and the Indian Army. A subsidiary title was included for the new medal, to denote in which Permanent Force or Regular Force the recipient was serving upon qualifying for the award of the medal. This took the form of a bar attached to the suspender of the Medal, inscribed \\"Regular Army\\" on medals awarded to members of the British Army, or with the name of the respective country or colony on the medals awarded by them. Apart from the subsidiary titles, all but one of the medals were identical. The exception was the Medal for Long Service and Good Conduct (South Africa) which was introduced in December 1939, since the inscriptions on the bar as well as on the reverse of the medal were bilingual, in Afrikaans and English on the bar and in English and Afrikaans on the medal reverse.

Author Prince Zhu Su (), was born in 1361 as the fifth son of the Hongwu Emperor (1328–1398), the founder of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Sources differ regarding whether the prince's given name was pronounced Xiao or Su. The uncommon Chinese character () can be pronounced sù (\\"a tall tree\\"), xiāo (\\"flourishing vegetation\\"), or qiū as a phonetic loan character for qiū (, \\"Chinese catalpa\\"). Zhu received the title of Wuwang (, \\"Prince of Wu\\") in 1370 and that of Zhouwang (, \\"Prince of Zhou\\") in 1378, and he was enfeofed with the district of Kaifeng, Henan, in 1381. In 1399, prince Zhu was banished to Yunnan, where he died in 1425 and received the posthumous name Zhou Dingwang (, \\"Prince Ding of Zhou\\"), which is often cited as author of the Jiuhuang bencao (Needham 1984: 331). Zhu Xiao was a talented scholar and wrote a collection of poetry called the Yuangong ci (). He also wrote two compilations of medical prescriptions, the Shenzhenfang (, \\"Divine Authentic Prescriptions\\"), and the Puji fang (, \\"Prescriptions for Common Benefit\\"), which is frequently quoted in the Bencao gangmu (Unschuld 1986: 221). Zhu Xiao studied botany when he lived in Kaifeng, which is located on the flood plains of the Yellow River and has historically suffered from natural disasters. Zhu Xiao wrote the Jiuhuang bencao from 1403 to 1406 after many years of careful research, presumably (Swingle 1935: 200) \\"in an effort to alleviate the sufferings and death that too frequently occur in China as a result of famine.\\" According to tradition, Zhu Xiao researched and chose potential famine foods, had them planted in experimental gardens, which Christopher (1985) called \\"famine gardens,\\" and commissioned scholars to observe and record the plants' developmental stages. For the woodblock-printed publication, Zhu had extremely true-to-life illustrations prepared to portray the respective famine plants. The German sinologist Emil Bretschneider (1895: 50) praised the Jiuhuang bencao woodcuts as \\"tolerably true to nature\\" and \\"certainly superior to some European wood-cuts of the 17th century\\". The American botanist Walter T. Swingle (1935: 194) says that in spite of their primitive technique, these woodcuts \\"are of high artistic quality.\\" Title The title combines jiùhuāng (, lit. \\"help; rescue\\" and \\"wasteland; famine\\"), meaning \\"send relief to a famine area; help tide over a crop failure\\", and běncǎo (, lit. \\"root\\" and \\"plant\\"), which usually means \\"pharmacopoeia; materia medica\\" for texts about herbal medicines but means \\"herbal\\" for the Jiuhuang bencao about famine foods (Swingle 1935: 200). There is no regular English translation of Jiuhuang bencao, and it has been translated as: *\\"Relieve Famine Herbal\\" (Swingle 1935) *\\"The Famine Herbal\\" (Read 1946) *\\"Treatise on Wild Food Plants for Use in Emergencies\\" (Needham et al. 1984) *\\"Materia Medica for Survival during Famines\\" (Unschuld 1986) *\\"Plants for Disaster Relief Food\\" (Chen et al. 1992) *\\"Famine Relief Pharmacopoeia\\" (Ho 2007) *\\"Materia Medica for the Relief of Famine\\" (Losso et al. 2007) Editions First page of preface of Jiuhuang bencao, from a 1593 edition In 1406, Zhu Xiao published the first edition Jiuhuang bencao in Kaifeng, with a preface written by a scholar in the prince's household, Bian Tong (), who explained: > The Prince of [Zhou] set up private nursery gardens ([pu] ) where he > experimented with the planting and utilisation of more than four hundred > kinds of plants, collected from fields, ditches and wildernesses. He himself > followed their growth and development from the beginning to the end of their > seasons. Engaging special artists ([huagong] ) to make pictures of each of > the plants and trees, he himself set down details of all the edible parts, > whether flowers, fruits, roots, stems, bark or leaves, and digested the > whole into a book with the title [Jiuhuang bencao]. He asked me, [Tong], to > write a preface, which I have done very willingly. Human nature is such that > in times when food and clothing is plentiful nobody takes a thought for > those who are, or may be, freezing and starving; then when the day comes > that they meet with this themselves, they have not the slightest idea what > to do and can only wring their hands. Therefore he who would govern himself > in order to govern the people should never lose sight of this for a single > moment. (tr. Needham 1984: 332) This original edition had two volumes, with four separately paginated parts. Beginning in the sixteenth century, many new and revised editions of the Jiuhuang bencao were published (Swingle 1935: 195, Needham 1984: 334–5, Unschuld 1986: 221). In 1525, Bi Mengzhai (), the governor Shanxi, ordered a second edition; the physician Li Lian () wrote the preface and Lu Dong () engraved the woodblocks. Li's preface explains the reason Zhu Xiao wrote the book. > The climate and soil of the five regions (he said) is not at all the same, > so the local plants are also quite different in form and quality. The names > are numerous and complicated, and it is difficult to distinguish one from > another, the true from the false. If one did not have illustrations and > explanations people would confuse [shechuang ( \\"milk parsley\\")] with [miwu ( > \\"hemlock parsley\\")], or [chini ( \\"ladybell\\")] with [renshen ( \\"ginseng\\")]. > Mistakes of this kind can kill people. This is why the [Jiuhuang bencao] was > written, with its pictures and descriptions to clarify the forms of the > plants and to record the methods of their use. In each case the writer first > states where the plant grows, then be gives its synonyms and speaks of its > Yang properties, whether refrigerant or calefacient, and its Yin sapidities, > whether sweet or bitter; finally he says whether one must wash the part to > be used (and for how long), soak it, fry it lightly, boil it, steam it, sun- > dry it, and so on, with details of whatever method of seasoning is > necessary.... If in time of famine people collect (emergency plants) in > accordance with the resources of the local flora, there will be no > difficulty and many lives will be saved. (tr. Needham 1984: 334–5) In 1959, Zhonghua Book Company published a 4-volume photocopied version of the 2nd edition. The third (1555) edition Jiuhuang bencao was printed in 4 volumes, one for each of the four original parts. It mistakenly identified the author as Zhu Xiao's son Zhou Xianwang () or Zhu Youdun (, 1379–1439). Li Shizhen's Bencao gangmu repeated this erroneous attribution to Zhou Xianwang. Owing to frequent content revisions of the text, the number of chapters and plants in some editions no longer corresponded with the 1st-edition Jiuhuang bencao. In 1562, Hu Cheng () reprinted the text in Sichuan, but he excluded nearly half of the original 414 plants. After the harsh 1565 famine, Zhu Kun of Baoshan, Yunnan paid to republish the original version in 1566, reprinted in 1586, but it only contained 411 plants. This 1586 edition is the oldest version preserved in China. In 1639, Hu Wenhuan () published Xu Guangqi's Nongzheng quanshu () collection, reprinted the Jiuhuang bencao with 413 plants. The first Japanese edition of the Jiuhuang bencao (Japanese Kikin honzō) was published in 1716. It was compiled and annotated by Matsuoka Jōan (, 1668–1746), a famous Japanese herbalist. In 1846, The French sinologist Stanislas Julien presented a copy of the Jiuhuang bencao to the French Academy of Sciences; and the Athenaeum (1846) said, \\"The Chinese government annually prints thousands [of this book], and distributes them gratuitously in those districts which are most exposed to natural calamities.\\" (Needham 1984: 331). Contents arrowhead plant illustration from the 1639 Nongzheng quanshu edition of Jiuhuang bencao The Jiuhuang bencao includes monographs on 414 famine plants, 138 that could function both as foods and drugs were from earlier texts like the Song dynasty Zhenglei bencao (, 1083), and 276 foods were new to Chinese pharmacopeias. Zhu Xiao arranged them in five classes, herbs 245 kinds, trees 80, cereals 20, fruits 23 and vegetables 46. There are 15 groups according to the part used; leaves 237 kinds, fruits 61, leaves and fruits 44, roots 28, roots and leaves 16, roots and fruits 5, roots and shoots 3, roots and flowers 2, leaves barks and fruits 2, stems 3, shoots and fruit 1 (Read 1946: 3). According to Read (1946: 3–4), at least 73 of Zhu Xiao's new food plants entered Chinese domesticated horticulture (e.g., taro, water- chestnut, bamboo shoot) and 16 more were adopted in the diet of Japan or Europe (watercress, wasabi, burdock). The Jiuhuang bencao entry for Sagittaria sagittifolia \\"arrowhead\\" exemplifies famine food plants that were first described by Zhu Xiao and later became normal Chinese crop plants. In the present day, this edible tuber, traditionally associated with Chinese New Year, is known as cígū ((, lit. \\"kindly mushroom\\"), also written (\\"kindly aunt\\") or (\\"thatch wild-rice\\")), jiǎndāocǎo (, \\"scissors herb\\"), or yànwěicǎo (, \\"swallow tail herb\\"). Zhu Xiao used the names shuǐcígū (, \\"water kindly wild-rice\\"), using gū (, \\"wild rice\\") instead of gū (, \\"mushroom\\"), jiǎndāocǎo, and jiàndācǎo (, \\"arrow hang herb\\"). > [Shuicigu] The common name for this is scissors herb [jiandaocao] or else > [jiandacao] (hung-up arrows herb). It grows in water, the item is grooved on > one side (wā []) and squarish on the other, with stringy fibres. The leaves > are three-horned, resembling indeed a pair of scissors. From amidst the > leaf-stalks rise up scapes which fork and bear three-petalled white flowers > with yellow centres. Each of these gives a blue-green fruit follicle ([gūtū > ]) like that of the [qīngchǔtáo \\"paper mulberry\\"] but rather smaller. The > (tuberous) root is of the same kind as that of the onion ([cōng ]) but > coarser and larger and of a sweet taste. In case of hunger collect the young > and tender shoots near the (tuberous) roots and scald them, then add oil and > salt, and eat. (tr. Needham 1984: 344) Needham remarks on the high degree of precision in 14th-century Chinese phytographic language (gūtū for \\"fruit follicle\\" generally – Sagittaria has many carpels – rather than the modern specification of \\"one-carpelled unilocular ovary\\"). Both Read (1946: 40) and Needham (1984: 344) note it is curious that Xu Xiao only recommended the shoots or turions for food, and not the starchy corms as a whole. Information in the ancient Jiuhuang bencao is not always reliable. For instance, the shānlídòu (, \\"mountain dark bean\\") \\"Lathyrus palustris; grass pea; marsh pea\\" entry says (tr. Needham 1984: 342), \\"ln time of famine collect the (young) pods and boil them, or boil the peas themselves to eat, or (dry them and) grind to flour and use like ordinary pea (flour).\\" However, Zhu Xiao did not warn that exclusively eating poisonous marsh peas (as during a famine) can result in lathyrism \\"a neurological disease causing paralysis of the legs\\" (Read 1946: 34, Needham 1984: 341). Esculentist Movement The Jiuhuang bencao originated what Joseph Needham (1969, 1984) called the \\"Esculentist Movement\\"—from the word esculent \\"edible; comestible\\"—of medieval Chinese botanical research into wild food plants safe to eat in an emergency. While this Ming dynasty movement only lasted from the late-14th century to the middle-17th century, Needham (1984: 328) says it \\"gave rise to some veritable monuments and masterpieces of applied botany.\\" Notable examples include *(1524) Yecai pu (, \\"Treatise on Wild Vegetables\\"), Wang Pan (), 60 plants; reprinted as Jiuihuang yepu ( \\"Relieve Famine Wild [Vegetable] Treatise\\"), and supplemented by the (c. 1630) Jiuhuang yepu buyi () *(c. 1550), Shiwu bencao (, \\"Food Herbal\\"), Lu He (), Wang Ling (), 400 *(1591) Yinzhuan fushi jian ( \\"Explanations of Diet and Nutrition\\"), Gao Lian , 164 *(1597) Rucao pian (, \\"Book of Edible Herbs\\"), Zhou Lüjing (), 105 *(1622) Yecai bolu (, \\"Encyclopedia of Wild Vegetables\\"), Bao Shan () 438 *(1642) Jiuhuang yepu (, \\"Treatise on Survival in the Wilderness and During Famine\\"), Yao Kecheng's () Shiwu bencao (, \\"Materia Medica of Nutrition\\"), 120 plants Each of these texts contained some plants not included in the Jiuhuang bencao, the identification of which has not received much attention by modern botanists (Needham 1984: 349). Bretschneider's (1895) study botanically identified 176 of the 414 Jiuhuang bencao plants; Read (1946) identified 358, leaving 56 unrevealed plants (1946: 3). Read's monograph notably includes annotated modern data on the chemical composition and nutritive value of some of the plants. Joseph Needham (1984: 330) concluded, \\"There can be no doubt that the esculentist movement constituted one of the great Chinese humanitarian contributions. We do not know of any parallel in European, Arabic or Indian medieval civilisation.\\" The first similar work in a European language was Charles Bryant's (1783) Flora Diaetetica, or History of Esculent Plants, both Domestic and Foreign. Evaluation The comparatively few Western scholars who have analyzed the Jiuhuang bencao have enthusiastically praised prince Zhu Xiao's 700-year-old famine herbal. Bretschneider (1895: 50) said the text \\"is not a simple compilation from earlier treatises, but for the greater part an original work based upon the author's own experience.\\" Swingle (1935: 194, 200) described it as \\"a valuable early treatise on Chinese botany\\", and the \\"earliest known, and still today the best\\" work on famine food plants.\\" The Belgian-American historian of science George Sarton (1947:1170) called it \\"the most remarkable herbal of medieval times\\". Needham (1984: 335) said that looking back at the work of Zhu Xiao, \\"one is struck by an impression of great originality. Certainly no previous work of a similar kind has come down to us.\\" The American anthropologist Robert L. Freedman (2008) said the Jiuhuang bencao is the \\"most well-known, and comprehensive study of famine food plants.\\" See also *Bigu (avoiding grains), Daoist dietary techniques employing some famine foods *Caigentan (\\"Vegetable Root Discourse\\"), (1590) compilation of aphorisms References     External links *, Jiuhuang bencao, 1778 Siku Quanshu edition, Internet Archive Category:Chinese classic texts Category:15th-century books Category:Edible plants ","title":"Jiuhuang Bencao"},{"id":"45307808","text":"John de Winchcombe was a priest in the Roman Catholic Church.

The church is the fourth oldest Protestant church in the city, with a distinct red edifice and towering steeple, rising out of the leafy surroundings. The church is dedicated to St. John the Evangelist. History =Chapel, school and library on Haines Road= St. John's Church traces its origin to a small chapel and school, located in Haines Road which connects Cleveland Town to Fraser Town. The small school has now grown into the St. John's High School in the church compound. Rev. R Posnett, Assistant Chaplain, Honorable East India Company, serving at St. Mark's Church played a significant role in establishing St. John's Church and the school. In those days, that end (Cleveland Town and Fraser Town) of the Bangalore Cantonment housed mainly pensioned officers and employees of the East Indian Company, Europeans and their native wives and Eurasian children. These Eurasian children were not allowed to enroll in the European styled schools of the Cantonment. Rev. Posnett saw the need to provide for a church and school for these residents of the Bangalore Cantonment. A single room measuring 750 ft2 was built, on Haines Road, serving as school during the day, library for the pensioners during the afternoon, and as a church on Sundays. Reference to the existence of this chapel/school can be found in the records of St. Mark's Church in February 1853. The chapel/school/library was built out of funds raised by officers of the East India Company. The reading room for pensioners at Haines Road is also mentioned by William Sproston Caine in his book 'Picturesque India: a Handbook for European Travellers', published in 1890 (p. 522). In a letter dated 23 April 1853, Rev. Posnett, writing to the Bishop of Madras, reported church services were held on Wednesday evenings and on Sundays, with the room filled to excess with 100-115 people in attendance. Further, the school was attended by 52 girls and 16 boys. Hence, there was a need to sell the present premises and move to a large ones. Rev. Posnett approached the Government of Madras, Church Building Society, and Major General Sewell, the then Commanding General Officer, for funds for construction of a school and chapel. However, it was uncommon for the Government of Madras to fund church buildings for civilian purposes (only churches for military congregations were funded), and hence the proposal was rejected. In 1950, writing in the St. John's Centenary Journal, Rev. W. Holder says \\"The exact site of this Chapel-School room is obscure, though a building, reputed to be such stands on Haines Road..\\". The exact location of this chapel/school is unknown at present, as are any other details such as the year of construction year or the associated cost. It is nevertheless possible that records could be found in the 'Madras Government Archives', 'Madras Diocese Office', 'Indian Church Trust, Calcutta' or the 'Bangalore Garrisons Office'. =Mootocherry Anglican Church= Rev. Posnett, managed to raise the required funds by appealing to the different congregations in India and abroad. The total collections amounted to INR 2,669 and 11 Annas, with £10 contributed by Rev. C. G. Townsend from Hatfield, England. An empty plot of land, lying beside the Roman Catholic chapel (future St. Francis Xavier's Cathedral) was purchased by Rev. Posnett for INR 100 in October 1853. The enclosure was built around the purchased land, earmarking it for the future Mootocherry Anglican Church, along with a school and library. The church, school and the library had matching Gothic architecture. Rev. Posnett had the church designed by the engineers who designed the Municipal Offices (Attara Katcheri, now Karnataka High Court building). The school and the library were completed on 16 May 1854, at a cost of INR 2,700. The schools, one each for boys and girls, were inaugurated on 28 May 1854 by Rev. Posnett, who had now become the chaplain of St. Mark's Church. =St. John's Church= Rev. Posnett, left St. Mark's Church in September 1854, and was succeeded by Rev. B. S. Clarke and Rev. D. J. Rogers, who continued to work towards building St. John's Church. They were able to get funding from the Church Building Society and the Government of Madras to expand the church, so as to accommodate 300 people. The expansion along with furniture and construction of the compound wall cost INR 11,625, with the works being supervised by the Madras Sappers and Miners regiment. St. John's Church was consecrated on 12 April 1858 by Rt. Rev. Thomas Dealtry the third Bishop of Madras, officially as St. John's Church, after St. John the Evangelist. Rev. Dealtry (son of Bishop Dealtry) became the first chaplain of the church. In 1914, the St. John's School had 135 girls and boys in attendance. As for the other schools in the cantonment, St. Aloysius School had 280 students, the Wesleyan Mission Secondary School had 235, and St. Andrews School had many students. Named after St. John After St. John's Church was established, the surround Mootocherry was renamed as St. John's Hill, and the road from the church to Ulsoor Lake was named as St. John's Church Road. The road connecting Meanee Avenue to Dickenson Road was named as St. John's Road, and the road leading Ulsoor Lake to the Kalpali Cemetery was named as St. John's Cemetery Road. Extensions The church tower was raised at the end of 1858, as the result of a contribution of INR 1,000 by Rev. Clarke, Rev. Rogers and Rev. Dealtry. In 1895-96, the edifice was extended to include the choir, a large portico and two front vestries. Pipe organ The pipe organ (by Norman and Beard) at St. John's is among the oldest and rarest, and very difficult to repair. Initially, air had to be pumped manually. An electric blower was added to the organ by Albert David in 1969. The organ is nowadays used only for special occasions. In 2013, a specialist team from Johannus, installed an Ecclesia T-270 at St. John's Church. The Ecclesia T-270 church organ has 40 voices, 2 manuals and an 8.1 audio system. WWI memorial There exists a memorial in front of the church for members of the church who lost their lives in service of 'King and Empire', in World War I. On Remembrance Day (11 November), the officers of the Madras Regiment offer their tributes at this memorial.

However, no record exists on the exact year when the cemetery was established. Before Indian Independence, only Europeans were allowed to be buried at the cemetery. In 1884, a War Memorial was raised in the cemetery by the Non Commissioned Officers of the 42nd Company of the Royal Engineers, in memory of their fallen comrades in peace time and war. This monument is now maintained by Madras Regiment. In 1858, a chapel was constructed in the cemetery, which was in use till the 1960s and after that was used to house the cemetery watchman, and unfortunately fell into disrepair. Community services Right from the late 1800s the church has been supporting the Poor Fund and the Leprosy Mission. In 1918, St. John's Institute was established for the benefit of the soldiers of the barracks nearby. In 1959, a hostel for Tibetan refugees was established. On 12 August 1978, the church established Asha Nivas, an elderly home in the church compound. The church also manages the Stephen's Old Age Home, in Clarke Street, Richmond Town. In 1999, an open-air chapel was established at St. John's Church cemetery, Kalpally. In June 2002, the St. John's Community Centre was established. Rev. Vinay Samuel, pastor of St. John's Church between 1975–83, and his wife Colleen Samuel, developed ministry for slum dwellers in Lingarajpuram, and helped establish a daughter congregation, Divya Shanti, at Lingarajpuram in 1983. Local name and former resident The local Tamil population of the cantonment call the church 'Sigapoo Oosimatha Koil', which translates to 'red church' in Tamil. Well known cartoonist Paul Fernandes remembers his childhood in Fraser Town, where the skyline was dominated by St. Francis Xavier's Cathedral and St. John's Church.

It is approximately long and flows through Wilkes-Barre and Hanover Township. The watershed of the stream has an area of . The stream is considered to be impaired by abandoned mine drainage. It is designated as a Coldwater Fishery, but is devoid of fish life. However, it does have some macroinvertebrates. Coal was mined in the stream's watershed in the past. At least one bridge crosses the stream. Course Spring Run begins in Wilkes- Barre, near Pennsylvania Route 309 and nor far from the village of Georgetown. It flows west-southwest for a short distance before turning northwest and then west-southwest again. After a few tenths of a mile, the stream turns southwest for a few tenths of a mile and then turns west. After several tenths of a mile, it turns west-southwest, exiting Wilkes-Barre and entering Hanover Township. The stream then turns south for several hundred feet before turning west and reaching its confluence with Solomon Creek. Spring Run joins Solomon Creek upstream of its mouth. =Tributaries= Spring Run has no named tributaries. However, it does have an unnamed tributary which joins Spring Run at the corner of Blackman Street and New Frederick Street. It also has a tributary known locally as Sulfur Run. Hydrology The entire length of Spring Run is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired. The source of the impairment is abandoned mine drainage and the cause is metals and siltation. The abandoned mine drainage in the watershed has caused the stream to have a low pH and high levels of suspended solids. The concentration of iron in the waters of Spring Run is 3.30 milligrams per liter and the daily load is . It requires an 87 percent reduction to meet the stream's total maximum daily load requirements. The concentration of manganese in the stream is 0.36 milligrams per liter and the load is . It requires an 11 percent reduction to meet the stream's total maximum daily load requirements. The aluminum concentration is 0.69 milligrams per liter and the daily load is per day. It requires an 85 percent reduction to meet the stream's total maximum daily load requirements. The concentration of alkalinity in the waters of Spring Run is 97.5 milligrams per liter. The daily load of it is per day. The pH of the stream ranges from 6.5 to 6.7. The discharge of Spring Run is 4.66 million gallons per day. However, it is an intermittent stream, only flowing during storm flows or rainfall. The watershed is mostly dry because the stream loses its flow to mine voids and permeable stream channels. The peak annual discharge of the stream has a 10 percent chance of reaching 540 cubic feet per second and a 2 percent chance of reaching 1025 cubic feet per second. It has a 1 percent chance of reaching 1325 cubic feet per second and a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 2200 cubic feet per second. The Solomon Creek Coldwater Conservation Plan described Spring Run as \\"one of the most degraded tributaries assessed in the Solomon Creek watershed\\". Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Spring Run is above sea level. The elevation of the stream's source is between above sea level. In the total maximum daily load document for Solomon Creek, Spring Run is described as being a small stream. It loses most of its water to underground mine pools. Both surface mines and deep mines occur in the watershed of Spring Run. Abandoned mining lands are present in the watershed. A rock formation known as Prospect Rock is located near the uppermost reaches of the watershed of Spring Run at an elevation of above sea level and above the Susquehanna River. It is approximately southeast of Public Square in Wilkes-Barre. Prospect Rock is a small and irregularly-shaped rock ledge made of very light grayish conglomerate. Nearly all of the Wyoming Valley can be seen from the rock. Watershed The watershed of Spring Run has an area of . The mouth of the stream is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Wilkes-Barre West. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Wilkes-Barre East. There are a total of of streams in the watershed. Most of the watershed of Spring Run drains the northwestern part of Wilkes-Barre Mountain as well as the communities of Georgetown, Laurel Run, and Wilkes-Barre Township. The stream is one source of flooding in Hanover Township. Pennsylvania Route 309 and Interstate 81 pass through the watershed of Spring Run in an east-to-west direction. A tract of Pinchot State Forest is in the stream's watershed. Spring Run and its watershed are situated in the northeastern part of the watershed of Solomon Creek. The stream's watershed is located immediately to the north of that of Pine Creek, another tributary of Solomon Creek. History Spring Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1188273. Coal mining has been done in the watershed of Spring Run. The Empire Silk Mill also once operated in the stream's watershed. It is the last standing mill in Wilkes-Barre. A prestressed box beam bridge carrying South Empire Street over Spring Run was constructed in 1972. It is long. A concrete culvert bridge carrying McLean Street over the stream was constructed in 1991. It is long. Biology Spring Run is considered to be a Coldwater Fishery. However, no trout inhabit the stream. Twenty percent of the macroinvertebrate taxa inhabiting Spring Run are of the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera. None of the taxa are mayflies.

The son of Pierre de Bancalis (1691-1761), he inherited the estate and lordship of Aragon, in 1758, from his maternal uncle, Jean-Marie de Maurel (on condition he assumed the additional name and arms de Maurel). He served briefly as French Ambassador to the Court of St James's but was recalled to Paris by the Revolutionary Government and, although he was not guillotined, he was imprisoned. He married, in 1761, Marchioness Henriette née de Portes de Pardaillan, who predeceased him; he died shortly after his release from prison in 1795. The family was stripped of its ancestral estates by the Republicans, although the titular marquisate devolved upon his son Jean-Louis-Henri de Bancalis de Maurel (whose daughter Ida married Joseph- Léonard, vicomte Decazes); the title remains extant.

A person who holds such positions is sometimes referred to as a \\"Kurdophobe\\". Origin and history The term 'anti-Kurdism' appears to have been first coined by Gérard Chaliand, who used it to describe anti-Kurdish sentiment in Iraq and Turkey during the mid to late twentieth century. Anti-Kurdish sentiment appears to have first emerged as a result of fears surrounding Kurdish nationalist aspirations for an independent Kurdistan and in response to the ultra-nationalist ideologies promoted by the states in which Kurds live. In Turkey, Kurdish identity was officially denied by the state, which sought to assimilate the Kurds in Turkey. The Turkish government institutionalized racism and paid academics to teach theories that would deny the existence of Kurds, such as the \\"kurt-kart theory\\". The theory claimed that Kurds were merely Turks whose name came from the \\"kurt-kart\\" sound the people made when they walked through the snow of the mountainous southeast of Turkey.\\"MGK paid academics to write on ‘kart kurt theory,’ commission report says.\\" Today's Zaman. 25 November 2012. http://www.todayszaman.com/national_mgk-paid-academics-to-write-on-kart-kurt- theory-commission-report-says_299296.html Various ultra-nationalist political parties and groups in Turkey have successfully campaigned using the general anti-Kurdish sentiment of the Turkish people. Anti-Kurdish sentiment increased in the Arab world during the formation of the United Arab Republic. At that time, Gamal Abdel Nasser implemented a policy of Arabizing the new republic by cracking down on political dissent among Kurds in Syria.Yildiz, Kerim. The Kurds in Syria: The Forgotten People. Palgrave Macmillan. 2005 Following the collapse of the United Arab Republic, Syria would be officially declared the Syrian Arab Republic based on these same policies. Anti-Kurdish sentiment has also been present in Iraq where there are large Kurdish populations. Anti- Kurdism manifested itself in the form of genocide and Saddam Hussein's Anfal campaign.Anderson, Liam. Avoiding Ethnic Conflict in Iraq: Some Lessons from the Aland Islands. Wright State University, UK. 2010. Current situation Kurds in Iraq and Syria have been embroiled in a war against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. As a result of the increasing awareness of the Kurdish people due to this conflict, anti-Kurdism has also been on the rise. In the United Kingdom, a Kurdish shop owner was attacked by a kurdophobe who said he wished genocide against all Kurdish people.\\"Kurdish staff told 'IS are doing the right thing by killing all the Kurds' in their Cheltenham shop\\".

Naki, who played for the Turkish club, Gençlerbirliği S.K., was attacked by Turks while he was out buying food in Turkey's capital, Ankara. The incident occurred shortly after Naki had declared that he was Kurdish and expressed support on social media for the Kurdish groups fighting against ISIS militants. A number of assailants allegedly cursed him and called him a \\"dirty Kurd\\" before beating him and injuring his hand and giving him a black eye.

He was known as one of the world's leading scholars of Dutch and Flemish paintings. He died in the 2015 Metro-North Valhalla train crash.  Early life  Liedtke was born in Plainfield, New Jersey, and grew up in Livingston, New Jersey. Liedtke studied Art History, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1967 from Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, a Master of Arts degree in 1969 at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. He received a Doctorate at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. Liedtke said that his interest in Dutch paintings began because he was focused on images as a child from hours and hours of watching a lot of TV. He described his aesthetic as that of having a focus on how he responded to visual patterns compared to a more typical perspective focused on story and narratives.  Career  = Academia = Liedtke planned on a career in academia. For two years Liedtke taught at the Florida State University, then at the University's villa in Florence. In 1974 he was working at the Courtauld Institute in London on his PhD dissertation, \\"Architectural painting in Delft, 1650–1675,\\" in which he discussed work of Gerrit Houckgeest, Pieter Saenredam, Hendrick Cornelisz. van Vliet and Emmanuel de Witte. From 1975 till 1979 he joined the faculty at Ohio State University. = The Metropolitan Museum of Art = After receiving a Mellon Fellowship he began studying at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he was appointed in 1980 as curator and would spend the rest of his career. He organized numerous exhibitions, wrote seven books, including several on Rembrandt and Vermeer, and produced catalogues of the Museum's Dutch and Flemish paintings. Liedtke served as a curator of European Paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for thirty-five years. Liedtke specialized in the paintings of Vermeer and the Delft School. The 2001 Liedtke-curated show, \\"Vermeer and the Delft School\\" was said to be the most popular art exhibition that year, attracting 555,000 visitors during its three-month run. At the time of his death he was preparing a catalogue of the museum's collection of Spanish paintings of the 15th to 18th century. Most recently, he worked on \\"El Greco in New York,\\" a collaborative project that was co-curated with Keith Christiansen, with the Hispanic Society of America and the Frick Collection held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art from November 4, 2014 to February 1, 2015.  Personal life  Liedtke was married to Nancy Liedtke a math teacher, artist, and equestrienne. He commuted daily from the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the Upper East Side neighborhood of New York City to what he called \\"the countryside,\\" Bedford Hills, New York in Westchester County. He said that he thought there was something \\"Dutch\\" about the way he lived: the idyllic countryside, his 100-year-old home, and his art collection, which he said was quintessentially Dutch in character. = Death = Along with five others, Liedtke died in the February 3, 2015 Metro-North crash, at the age of 69. Thomas Campbell, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, described him as \\"one of the most distinguished scholars of Dutch and Flemish painting in the world.\\" Many in the art and museum community posted reflections and appreciation of Liedtke's work.

The historical sources refer to members of this family as nobles in the area of the Luka županija in the Zadar-Biograd hinterland (12th–16th centuries), as the lords (knezes) of Omiš (12th and 13th centuries), and as the lords of the Makarska Riviera (15th and 16th centuries). Another prominent branch of the family, Kacsics, was part of the Hungarian nobility and from it branched many families including Szécsényi. Family members of the Omiš branch were known for piracy in the Adriatic Sea, clashes with Venice, and were even accused of Patarene heresy. To the Makarska branch belonged the Croatian poet and Franciscian monk, Andrija Kačić Miošić, whose work Razgovor ugodni naroda slovinskog (Pleasant Conversation of Slavic People, 1756) was one of the most popular Croatian literary works for more than a century. Notable members of the Hungarian branch were Bans of Croatia and Slavonia. Etymology The family derives from the Slavic kača (snake). Based on etymology, it is likely that the Hungarian Kačićs (Kacsics) are originally of Slavic rather than Hungarian origin. Latin sources also refer to the name as de genere Chacittorum, generatione Cacich, genus Chacittorum, nobiles de Cacich, Caçici, Cacicii, Cacicli, Caciki, Cazethi, Cazichi, Cazziki, Chacichi and Kazzeti. The Kačić name is distinct from the similar- sounding name of another noble family, Kašić (Chasich), and its derivations (Kasig, Kasige). History The Kačić's family can be traced to the Pacta conventa, an agreement dating from 1102 (or later), according to which the Kačićs were one of the twelve Croatian noble tribes (genus) who accepted the Hungarian king Coloman as the new king of Croatia. They were represented by comes Juraj Kačić (Comittem Gurram de genere Chaçittorum). According to the Supetar Cartulary, they were one of six tribes which selected bans who, in turn, elected a new king in a case where the prior king died without leaving heirs. The first mention of Kačićs is considered 1165, when the Byzantine chronicler John Kinnamos said that 57 cities in Croatia and Dalmatia as well the \\"nation Kačićs\\" came under the Byzantine rule. The Kačićs were mostly recorded in the scope of sales contracts and lands disputes, or as witnesses. In 1182, the first explicitly mentioned noblemen as members of the genus Kačić are Miroš Kačić (1166–82) and his son Dobroš, previously also Miroš's father Toljen (1164–66), the judge of Tinj, Toliš Kačić with sons Juraj and Deško, Premko Kačić with sons Dragoš and Pribislav, and likely Otra with his son Dragoslav. The Kačić family originated in the Zadar hinterland near the Krka river, and when King Petar Krešimir IV mastered the Pagania, some members of the family likely relocated to the area between the Cetina and Neretva rivers. The social distinction between noble Kačićs in the Zadar-Biograd hinterland and the princely (knezes) Kačićs from Omiš remains uncertain, but the two families are considered to be related. The clearest established connection is the noble Hodimir, mentioned in 1207 in a charter of St. Peter's Church in Bubnjani near Tinj, whose son Nikola was an Omiš knez. In the 12th and 13th centuries Kačićs possessed lands in the Zadar hinterland, in the wider area of Tinj, Nadin, Kačina Gorica, Kokićani and Kamenjani. From the mid-14th to 15th century, their holdings expanded to include Podnadin, Bistrovina, Butina, Kačina Gorica, Suhovaram, Grguricavas and Krneza, and the wider area around those villages. The center of the genus was in Nadin, for some Zadar, Nin and possibly Pag, where \\"dominum Caçigh\\" is mentioned. According to M. Marković, in the early 11th century, the lands West of Nadin were ruled by the tribe Lapčan, while in the East by family Kašić. The family name of the Kačićs can be found in the toponyms Kačina Gorica, Kačišćina (alleged second name for Bistrovina), Kačićić (Chacichich) and Kačić (Cacich). In the 14th century the family members began to identify themselves by family names with the adjective \\"de generatione Cacich\\". In the next period the Kačićs can be traced through three families. In the 15th to 17th centuries a branch settled in the wider area of Cazin and Bosanska Krupa, where in 1487 there was a dispute between them and the Babonić noble family. The last mention of Nadin Kačićs dates back to 1527, when Šimun (Simon) was in the citadel of Zadar, after pressure from the Ottoman conquest. Omiš branch Mirabella Fortress (Peovica), where the Kačićs and pirates of Omiš had their main hideout. The first known knez of Omiš, Nikola, was mentioned, along with his relatives and everyone under his lordship, in a peace treaty with Kotor from 1167. Knez Nikola's power and independence was strong enough to have Rogerije, the Archbishop of Split, executed in 1180. Family political influence at that time included Brač and Hvar, Breueco (Brenti, Brevko, Brečko)also of genus Kačićas well as the previous Šibenik iupanus (župan). Archbishop Rogerije, who also served Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos as representative governor of Croatia, had become involved in a dispute about an estate around Mosor. A conte Nicola Aprico, who was identified in two dispute settlements of Split during 1178–79, is considered to be the same knez Nikola. In 1190, Nikola established a peace treaty with Dubrovnik. Like the 1167 treaty with Kotor, the 1190 treaty granted safe and free navigation to Dubrovnik ships from Molunat to Orebić (Trstenica). The area of Omiš principality seems to have included the islands of Brač, Hvar and Vis, and probably at some point Korčula, but it is uncertain whether the land included coastal Poljica and Žrnovnica to the North and Makarska coast to the South. In the 13th century the center of the principality was Omiš, and with the title of Omiš knez (comes) the sources also mentioned the title of knez for the islands. In the 13th century the terms Kačićs (Kačići) and residents of Omiš (Omišani) are both mentioned, making it sometimes more difficult to reliably identify members of the genus. However, it seems that the princely titles were held only by the Kačićs. They achieved a large degree of independence from the central government and imposed the name of Omiš and Kačić family over the entire region. Kačićs and Omiš citizens made a peace treaty with Venice in 1208, and the brothers Desislav, Radoš, Dragan, Bogdan and Sinko were mentioned by knez Sebena in the document. However, in February 1215, Kačićs were, for first time, cited for piracy. In 1220, the Hungarian-Croatian king Andrew II threatened retaliation with the royal army against knez Malduč and his relatives unless the piracy and heresy ended. In May 1221, Pope Honorius III sent legate Aconcius to the citizens of Split, among other cities, to prevent piracy and defend the Crusaders. In 1222, the pope sought help from residents of Dubrovnik against the activity of Bosnian heretics and Omiš pirates. His efforts, as well as those of Guncel, Archbishop of Split, resulted in a temporary peace treaty with Kačići Omišani (Cacecli Almesiani). In 1232, Venetians mentioned that Dubrovnik was not allowed to accept Kačićs and Omišani, and if Venice were to send ships against Kačićs, Dubrovnik must join the Venetians with a ship of at least 50 people. Nikola of Hodimir and Pribislav of Malduč claimed bail in May 1239 for the Omišani who murdered Dubrovnik nobleman Grubeša and looted his ship. They also agreed to pay compensation for personal property that had been looted. In Omiš during the same year, knez Nikola and his relatives made peace between Zachlumia and Split, agreeing to pay for damage earlier in the year when Malduš nephew Toljen ravaged Split. However, compensation for the ravages of Toljen was not paid, leading to conflict in the following year. After an unsuccessful attack on Omiš, the Split army captured Brač in the first half of 1240. The conflict continued until the peace agreement by which the brothers of Osor left the ships to Split and renounced looting. This was also the time period of the Split potestas Gargano, and Malduč sons Pribislav and Osor in Hvar and Brač. In March 1244, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II threatened conflict with the Omišani over damage incurred along the Apulian coast. In March 1245, knez Nikola of Hodimir, with 100 Omiš citizens and knezes Pribislav, Osor, Juraj, Radoš (son of Bogdan), Slomir, and Prodan (son of Dragan), made a treaty with Dubrovnik. According to the 1245 treaty, if the king called upon the Kačićs and Omišani to help in an attack on Dubrovnik, they would respond with the least possible forces. In 1252–54, Juraj helped Stefan Uroš I of Serbia in the war with Dubrovnik, as he was married to Stefan's daughter. In 1256, a dispute between knez Osor and the city Trogir about property in the village of Bijaći was resolved by king Béla IV and ban Stjepan. In 1258, when the king confirmed rights to the Omišani, knezes Osor and Radoš were called \\"kingdom noblemen\\". Documents from 1261-62 describe an agreement in which Dubrovnik paid blood feud to the relatives of murdered Omišani, who promised not to cause any harm to the Dubrovnik residents. In 1267–68, the Doge warned the citizens of Split about helping Omiš pirates. In 1271, the pirates looted a ship on which the Archbishop of Trani was traveling to Dubrovnik. A similar incident occurred in 1273 when pirates commanded by Stanoj and Saracen looted the ship of bishop Kefalinije Henrik. Charles I of Naples signed an alliance with Split and Šibenik against Omiš pirates in June and September 1274. The citizens of Omiš responded by an alliance with Venice in August, in accordance with a 20-year peace treaty signed by knezes Radoš, Bogdan, Juraj and Semen. This triggered conflict on the land and sea in 1275. The activities in the intermediate years are unknown, besides that in April 1278 the islands of Hvar and Brač recognized Venetian authority, and the Omiš in 1281. At the end of the 13th century, the Omiš branch of the Kačić family was involved in the politics of more powerful authorities. Their local hereditary oligarchy disappeared, but the Kačićs probably continued to live in the area. The war with Venice at the end of the 1270s and the beginning of the 1280s led to their loss of Omiš in favor of princes from the Šubić noble family. The Omiš Kačićs are mentioned for the last time in 1294, when the Venetians wrote to Dubrovnik residents seeking compensation from Dubrovnik authorities who had failed to send an armed ship against Omiš pirates. It is not known whether Ivan, son of Matej Kačić, mentioned in Dubrovnik 1285, was related to the Omišani Kačićs. After that, Kačićs are no longer mentioned. =Notable members= *Nikola Kačić (Nicola kenesius Alemyscii), ruled between c. 1167 and c. 1180. *Sebena Kačić, Malduč Kačić, Radoš Kačić, Bogdan Kačić *Juraj or Đuro Kačić, married the daughter of King Stefan Vladislav of Serbia (r. 1234–1243). Makarska branch Gradac is naturally protected by Biokovo mountain, making it mainly accessible by the sea. In 15th-century sources, Kačićs appear in the Makarska Riviera (Krajina), most likely as the descendants of Omiš branch Kačićs. According to the genealogy preserved by the most well known member of the family, Andrija Kačić Miošić, one branch of the family went to Hungary, and there fought with Zagar noble family. They returned to Dalmatia, one brother to Zadar, another to Šibenik, and the last two to the Makarska Riviera, where they started building castles in Gradac and Trpanj, as well as practicing piracy up to Apulia. The first known member of the Makarska branch was Vrsajko. According to the genealogy, the family branched out from his son Baran (second half of the 14th century). Baran's sons Vukašin, Vukić, Andrijaš and Baran were mentioned in historical documents; Bosnian king Stephen Ostoja, in 1417, confirmed the rights of his vassals Vukašin, Baran and Juraj Vukačić to Makar, Drvenik, Pasičina, Miluse, Lapčanj (Gradac), which were previously confirmed by Bosnian ban Stephen II Kotromanić and Bosnian king Tvrtko I. In July 1452, Grubiša sought for his family and all residents of Krajina to become Venetian vassals. Venice accepted the request, confirmed their old customs, allowed the foundation of fort and port in Makar, and forgave older violence. Thus, the Kačićs and residents of Krajina fought at their own expense between Neretva and Cetina rivers, and gave taxes to Venice. A Venetian confidant on Hvar reported, in 1498, the Ottoman preparation of 25 ships for sea attack on Krajina and Kačićs. In the next year, they became Ottoman subjects. In 1500, the Split monarch reported to Venice that Ottomans captured several delegates from Split, and that safely arrived in Mostar only thanks to knez Juraj Marković, an Ottoman subject and Venetian friend. Marković wrote from Makarska to Venice that he was knez for 15 years and always a friend of the Venetians. In the Marković collection and archive, D. Papalić found the Croatian redaction of the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja. During the Ottoman rule, Kačićs were only partially mentioned, but still lived there. From the beginning of the 17th century, they can again be traced in the documents, but as family members of several branches descending from the coastal princes. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the family continued to branch out and become independent genera. Their names usually carried a combination with \\"Kačić\\", as well had the title of \\"conte\\". According to the genealogy, from Vukašin's sons Vukmir, Grubiša, Radoja and Radonja emerged three branches. Per settlement, Vukmir's descendants are known as Kačićs of Gradac, while those of Radonja and Grubiša are Kačićs of Brist. From the first branch emerged Jurčević, Viskić (Visko), Stipić, Pekić (Peko) and Bartolović (older Sladojević), while from the second branch came Miošić, Aleksić (Alesić), Žarković and Barišić. The Kačić- Bartolović or Bartulović branch is a member of Croatian Nobility Association, which was formed in 1995. Descended from Baran's son Vukić, in Kotišina, were Terzić, Šimunović (extinct in the 17th century), Marković, and probably Begić. From Baran's son Andrijaš emerged Šiljić (Šilje), Perić, Klarević (Čavelić), Baše (Bašić) and Filipčević. Kačićs from Makar divided into Andrijašević and Mitrović. Descended from Baran's son Baran was the family of Baranović. =Notable members= *Bartul Kačić-Žarković (1572–1645), bishop of Makarska between 1615 and 1645 *Petar Kačić-Šilje (c. 1606–1661), bishop of Makarska between 1646 and 1660 *Pavao Barišić Kačić (died 1721), provincial of Franciscan Province of Bosna Srebrena between 1693 and 1696 *Antun Kačić (1686–1745), bishop of Trogir between 1722 and 1730), and archbishop of Split between 1730 and 1745 *Andrija Kačić Miošić (1704–1760), Franciscan and poet *Juraj Paškal Terzić Kačić (1740–1820), canon and poet *Pavao Klement Miošić Kačić (1786–1837), bishop of Split-Makarska between 1829 and 1837 *Petar Peko Kačić (1830–1918), Franciscan and ethnographer Hungarian branch The ruins of Salgó Castle The ruins of Hollókő Castle. Several scholars considered that Hungarian Kacsics may have been descendants of Omiš Kačićs. They are mentioned in the early 13th century, in Northern counties Nógrád, Salgó and Hollókő. The first mentioned noblemen are brothers Michael Kacsics and Simon Kacsics, the Voivode of Transylvania (1209–1212; 1215) and Ban of Slavonia (1212; somewhere 1213–1218). Simon took part in the murder of Queen Gertrude of Merania (24 September 1213); therefore, King Andrew II of Hungary confiscated his possessions.Kristó, Gyula (editor): Korai Magyar Történeti Lexikon - 9–14. század (Encyclopedia of the Early Hungarian History - 9–14th centuries); Akadémiai Kiadó, 1994, Budapest; . Supporters of the Andrew II in his rebellion against the elder brother and then king Emeric may have included the noble family Kačić. With the new king's intention of spreading his circle of supporters, some members of the family were probably gifted with estates in Hungary. A relationship between Hungarian and Omiš Kačićs is identified primarily in the mention of Šimun Kačić in a document from 1178, with father Nikola and brother Jakov, and with brothers Borislav, Bogdan and other family members in a document from 1190. In the next two or three generations, the genus branched into several lineages and families. First the Zagyvafői, Libercsei, and later Libercsei Tompoši, Libercsei Radó, Füleki, Ozdini, Etre, Kecsői/Berzencei, Hollókői, Salgói, and Bejei. Michael's son Falkos (1255) held properties at Szécsény and Nógrád, and was the founder of genus Libercsei, from which emerged powerful Szécsényi, Geréb of Vingárta, and Farkas of Szeszárme. To the Szécsényi belonged Kónya, Ban of Croatia (1366–67), while to the Geréb belonged Matthias, also Ban of Croatia (1483–92). The members of the genus accepted the supremacy of Máté Csák III, one of the most powerful oligarchs of the kingdom, around 1300; only one of them, Thomas Szécsényi became the partisan of King Charles I. Consequently, the king granted him his relatives' possessions following victories over the oligarch. =Notable members= * Michael Kacsics (died after 1228), Voivode of Transylvania between 1209 and 1212, Ban of Slavonia 1212 * Simon Kacsics (died after 1228), Voivode of Transylvania in 1215, Ban of Slavonia in 1213 * Farkas, Master of the cupbearers for the Queen in 1298, father of Thomas Szécsényi * Simon Kacsics (died after 1327), Count of the Székelys between 1321 and 1327 * Kónya Szécsényi (died after 1367), Ban of Croatia between 1366 and 1367 * Matthias Geréb (died 1489), Ban of Croatia between 1483 and 1489  See also  *Croatian nobility *List of noble families of Croatia *Twelve noble tribes of Croatia  References  = Notes = = Sources =   * *  Further reading   Category:Kačić Category:Omiš Category:Croatian noble families ","title":"Kačić family"},{"id":"45309485","text":"Sirdavidia is a monotypic genus of flowering plants from the family Annonaceae described February 4, 2015, by Thomas L.P. Couvreur of France's Institute of Research for Development, Raoul Niangadouma of the Herbier National du Gabon, Bonaventure Sonké of the University of Yaoundé, and Hervé Sauquet of Université Paris-Sud. The genus was named in honor of Sir David Attenborough. The type species Sirdavidia solannona was discovered and collected in Gabon in Crystal Mountains National Park on November 15, 2013, at elevations of 300–600 meters. The species name refers to the resemblance of the flowers to those of Solanum species. Description Sirdavidia is distinguished from other Annonaceae by its floral morphology, which is indicative of buzz pollination, a phenomenon that has never been observed in Annonaceae or Magnoliidae but is common amongst Solanaceae. This species is a tree growing about 4 to 6 meters tall with a narrow trunk just a few centimeters wide. The leaves are up to 26 centimeters long by 9 wide, roughly oval in shape with long, pointed tips. The inflorescences occur in the leaf axils and directly from the trunk. There are male and bisexual flowers. Each is made up of three whorls: one whorl of red sepals and two whorls of red petals. As the flower blooms the petals spread outward and sometimes curl backward toward the stalk. At the center are 16 to 19 stamens with bright yellow tips. The mature fruit and seeds have not yet been described.

Presiding goddess Mahalasa is identified with Mohini, the female avatar of the god Vishnu. Mahalasa has four hands, carrying a Trishula, a sword, a severed head, and a drinking bowl. She stands on a prostrate man or demon, as a tiger or lion licks blood dripping from the severed head. She also wears the yajnopavita (sacred thread), which is generally dedicated on male deities. She stands on a prostrate man or demon, as a tiger or lion licks blood dripping from the severed head. Goud Saraswat Brahmins as well as Vaishnavas from Goa and South Canara identify her with Mohini and call her Narayani and Rahu- matthani, the slayer of Rahu, as told in the Bhavishya Purana. While in this shrine, Mahalasa is associated with Mohini and Vishnu, in the Khandoba cult, she is regarded as a form of goddess Parvati and wife of Khandoba, a form of Shiva (Parvati's husband). History Mahalsa's older temple in Old Mardol or Velham or Verna, Salcette was destroyed by the Portuguese in 1567, though the icon of the Mahalasa was rescued. It was shifted here from Velham to avoid destruction during the forcible Christianization of Salcette. When the current temple in Mardol (which was outside Portuguese control) was built in the 17th century, the icon was reconsecrated. The icon's history before Verna is blurry. Some believe that the main temple of Mahalasa was originally located in Nepal. She was moved to Aurangabad in Maharashtra. During the Mughal domination, Aurangabad fell under the Muslim rule and the icon was moved to a secret location in Goa. Later, a small temple was built at Verna. Architecture Entrance, Samai and Deepastambha The Mardol temple complex also has smaller temples of the goddess Shantadurga (Santeri) and Lakshmi Narayan (Vishnu with his consort Lakshmi), who are worshipped daily with Mahalasa. The shrines for five main ganas (attendants) of Mahalasa, namely Grampurush, Bhagwati, Dadh, Simha Purush and Mhal Purush, are also located within the temple premises. Daily worship of all these deities is carried out before worshipping the main goddess. The temple has canteen which is run by the workers. After the morning and evening aarti the Prasad- the holy meal is served here. The temple is famous in Goa for its huge brass bell. The bell does not have a ringer. The ringer was attached only when somebody wanted to testify. It was believed that the goddess will punish the person by killing the person in three days who lied while ringing the bell. The belief was so strong that during the Portuguese rule the testimony in the temple was considered acceptable in the court of law. It is also famous for its Brass Divli/Samai (oil lamp). Rituals and festivals Palakhi on Sunday Mahalasa is considered as both female (as Mohini) and male (as a form of Vishnu). She is dressed in alankar (ornaments, costume) as various Vishnu-related deities at various days in the year. She is dressed as Vishnu's wife Lakshmi as well as Vishnu's male forms like Rama, Krishna (Bala Krishna - infant Krishna, Krishna killing Kaliya), Vithoba, Venkateswara etc. Generally, the male or main deity accompanies the right hand position (considered superior to the left). However, in joint processions or functions, Shantadurga is given the right hand seat, while Mahalasa sits on her left, as per the lore that Mahalasa gave the former the honour. Sunday holds a special significance for the temple and the presiding goddess. On this day, Palakhi Seva is performed in addition to other rituals. The goddess is taken out for a ride around the temple in a palanquin (palakhi). The palanquin is decked up with flowers and traditional colourful decorations. A large crowd gathers to participate in the event and the devotees sing her praises. The Magha Jatra (festival) at the temple and Navaratri (festival dedicated to the Hindu goddess) are the main annual temple celebrations. In 2011, the temple banned entry of foreigners into the temple citing objectionable dressing and conduct as the reason.Goa temple bans entry of foreigners, others impose dress code References Category:Hindu temples in North Goa district ","title":"Mahalasa Narayani Temple, Mardol"},{"id":"45309514","text":"Bagur Navile Tunnel is the longest water tunnel in India.

Front page of The Logan and Albert Bulletin  History  The newspaper was originally established in 1885 under the masthead the Southern Queensland Bulletin, a four-page weekly produced on a hand run machine in a tin shed by printer-editor P.J. McNamara. There were several changes of ownership before the paper was bought by James Shepherd in 1895 and changed the title to The Logan and Albert Bulletin. Shepherd was joined by W.D. Mellor in the propriety and together they launched another paper, The Beaudesert Herald in 1904. By 1905 The Logan and Albert Bulletin had expanded to eight pages and was considered an old-established paper with a large circulation containing bright readable matter. The paper was sold to Edward Fass, who became Southport's second mayor, in 1905. Ownership of the paper continued to change over the next 50 years and it was the multi-generational contribution of the Rootes family that provided stability to the publication. On 21 December 1928, under the editorship of Mr Michael James O'Donohue, the newspaper changed format to a tabloid and altered its masthead for a third time to The South Coast Bulletin. A fourth name change occurred on 8 May 1963 when The South Coast Bulletin became the Gold Coast Bulletin.

When he stops by to sell his products, he first puts up a magic show. Bystanders gather around to watch. His first act shows him playing a clarinet while a python dances. His second act features a lady wolf being inside a wooden box which Krazy saws into four pieces. But instead of his assistant being divided, four small lady wolves pop out of each piece. When the parts of the wooden box are placed back together, the lady wolf comes out back in her one self. After doing his acts, Krazy starts retailing his bottles of liquid medicine. One of his customers is an old beagle. The old beagle, after consuming a bottle, suddenly becomes very able and dances very fluently but also transforms into a small puppy who merrily leaves in a scooter. Krazy's second customer is a pet dog with a flea problem. Krazy pours liquid from one of his bottles onto the pet dog. The fleas start to jump out and leave their host. As more customers flock to Krazy's wagon, a rat can be seen drinking one of his bottles. The rat, for some reason, transforms into a vicious lion. The lion scares everybody, including Krazy, away from the scene. The lion continues to chase Krazy for many yards. On the way, the lion comes across a pack of dachshunds. The dachshunds try to outrun the lion but the big cat swallows them. The dachshunds are able to exit the lion's mouth. But as they come out, the little dogs have been transformed into little lions. Despite their size, the little lions manage to scare away their swallower. The little lions then turn to and confront Krazy. But as they jump forth, Krazy traps the tiny beasts in a bottle.

Published in Veu de Catalunya, 25 April 1912 Nature morte, signed \\"JMetzinger\\" (lower right), is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 93.5 x 66.5 cm (36 3/4 by 26 1/4 in.), representing a still life. It is an interior scene depicting various objects including a compotier filled with fruit, a carafe, pears, a cup, a vase of flowers, and a jug (cruche) decorated with dear (cerfs). The objects are placed on a diamond-shaped table. In the 'background' (upper left) is another table with a glass and bowl resting on it. The colors employed by the artist are typical of early Cubism, ranging from reds to earth tones and greens—a legacy of Paul Cézanne. Rather than blurring the distinction between superimposed elements with irregular brushstrokes, Metzinger has clearly outlined each object with a thin dark line. Geometry Jean Metzinger, Nature morte (Compotier et cruche décorée de cerfs), published in Nya Konstgalleriet, exhibition catalogue, 1–15 April 1917 The vertical composition is treated is a highly personal geometrically Cubist style with various planes, angles, layers and facets. The table upon which objects are placed is angled as if seen from above. The fruits, bowl, jug and other elements are depicted as if seen from a side view and from above simultaneously, giving an illusion of an overall flattening of the picture plain—a devise used by Cézanne, from which all of the Cubists drew inspiration.Christopher Green, MoMA, Cubism, Technical and stylistic innovations, From Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009 Cézanne's reduction of the visible world into fundamental shapes (cone, cube, sphere), the faceted reconstruction of nature through purely painterly forms, the fracture and flattening of space,Paul Cézanne, Still Life with Milk Jug and Fruit, c. 1900, National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. are all present in Metzinger's picture. However, where the dialectic nature of Cézanne's work had been greatly influential during the highly expressionistic phase of proto- Cubism, between 1908 and 1910, the work of Georges Seurat, with its flatter, more linear structures, would capture the attention of Metzinger from early 1911.Alex Mittelmann, State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time, 2011 :\\"With the advent of monochromatic Cubism in 1910-1911,\\" writes art historian Robert Herbert, \\"questions of form displaced color in the artists' attention, and for these Seurat was more relevant. Thanks to several exhibitions, his paintings and drawings were easily seen in Paris, and reproductions of his major compositions circulated widely among the Cubists. The Chahut [Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo] was called by André Salmon \\"one of the great icons of the new devotion\\", and both it and the Cirque (Circus), Musée d'Orsay, Paris, according to Guillaume Apollinaire, \\"almost belong to Synthetic Cubism\\".Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo- Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York Paintings by Albert Gleizes, 1910-11, Paysage, Landscape; Juan Gris (drawing); Jean Metzinger, c.1911, Nature morte, Compotier et cruche décorée de cerfs. Published on the front page of El Correo Catalán, 25 April 1912 The concept was well established among the French avant-garde that painting could be expressed mathematically, in terms of both color and form. This mathematical expression resulted in an independent and compelling 'objective truth,' perhaps more so than the objective truth of the object represented. Indeed, the Neo-Impressionists had succeeded in establishing an objective scientific basis in the domain of color (Seurat addresses these problems in Circus and Dancers). Soon, the Cubists were to do so in both the domain of form and dynamics (Orphism) would later do so with color too.

Published in Apollinaire's 1913 Les Peintres Cubistes, Exhibited at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants. Provenance: Jacques Nayral, Niels Bohr Metzinger played a crucial role in the establishment of the Cubist movement, on both artistic and theoretical levels (organizing and exhibiting at the first public manifestations of Cubism at the 1910 and 1911 Salons; and publishing a series of writings in well-established literary journals defining and defending Cubism. Metzinger was the first to write that four artists had dismissed traditional perspective and felt free to move around their subjects, studying them from various points. in Jean Metzinger, Note sur la peinture (Note on painting), Pan, Paris, October–November 1910, 649-51, reprinted in Edward Fry Cubism, London, 1966. Quotation of the original French have been translated by Daniel RobbinsJohn Golding, Cubism: A History and an Analysis, London, 1959, p. 27) In this seminal work, he compares the similarities between the paintings of Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Robert Delaunay, Albert Gleizes and Henri Le Fauconnier. In doing so he enunciated for the first time what would become known as the primary characteristics of Cubism: the notions of simultaneity and mobile perspective. In this 1910 text Metzinger stressed the distance between their works and traditional perspective. These artists, he wrote, granted themselves 'the liberty of moving around objects', and combining many different views in one image, each recording varying experiences over the course of time.Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, Cubism and Culture, Thames & Hudson, 2001 Deux Nus (Two Nudes, Two Women), oil on canvas, 92 x 66 cm, Gothenburg Museum of Art, Sweden. Exhibited at the first Cubist manifestation, Room 41 of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants, Paris Of this group, only Metzinger and Braque were familiar with the works of Picasso, and Metzinger alone, familiar with the works of everyone in the group. Metzinger was the first to recognize explicitly and implicitly the significance of the use of \\"a free, mobile perspective\\", and the \\"mixing... of the successive and the simultaneous\\".Daniel Robbins, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, University of Iowa Museum of Art, Iowa City, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23 Nature morte shows Metzinger's particular interest in the use of mathematics and geometry. In Du \\"Cubisme\\", written the following year, Metzinger and Gleizes proclaimed: :\\"To establish pictorial space, we must have recourse to tactile and motor sensations, indeed to all our faculties. It is our whole personality which, contracting or expanding, transforms the plane of the picture. As it reacts, this plane reflects the personality back upon the understanding of the spectator, and thus pictorial space is defined: a sensitive passage between two subjective spaces. The forms which are situated within this space spring from a dynamism which we profess to dominate. In order that our intelligence may possess it, let us first exercise our sensitivity. There are only nuances. Form appears endowed with properties identical to those of color. It is tempered or augmented by contact with another form, it is destroyed or it flowers, it is multiplied or it disappears\\".Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Du \\"Cubisme\\", published by Eugène Figuière Éditeurs, Paris, 1912. Translated in Robert L. Herbert (ed.), Modern Artists on Art, New York, 1986, p. 8 While Nature morte \\"shows the artist's mastery of abstraction and geometry\\", writes Sotheby's in their Lot notes, \\"all of the compositional elements combine to create a remarkable evocation of the still-life subject\\". In this way, Nature morte achieves the artist's goals \\"of engaging with and enveloping the viewer\\".

Township first became available as an Adobe Flash application on the social-networking website WhatsApp Social. The game was released for iOS on February 24, 2012, and on Google Play on November 13, 2013. On February 16, 2014, it was released on the Amazon Appstore. By November 2017, the game had been downloaded 120 million times, with more than 3.5 million people playing Township every day. Gameplay Township is a game that combines city-building and farming.Township for iOS Players are guided through a brief tutorial at the very beginning of the game. The player begins with a starter town and in order to develop it they should harvest crops, run processing facilities and sell goods. The primary currency in the game is T-cash. Besides, the player also earns XP (experience points) and coins for performing different kinds of actions in the game. Coins are used to buy factories, community buildings, decorations and XP points are used to level up. As the player accumulates XP points and goes through levels (in which each level beaten, more XP is needed to level up), more kinds of crops, factories, community buildings, decorations, and \\"special\\" buildings become available. A player can spend real money to buy Tcash, as well as coins. There are special things one can build, along with a Helicopter Pad which one can fill orders. Trains In Township, players can use trains. They fill these trains up with goods and they return some time later with materials you can use to build buildings, expand your territory, and to upgrade your barn's capacity. Once the mine is bought at Level 21, you also get mining tools from the trains. Once you reach Level 5, you unlock your first train, free. Train 2 arrives at Level 14, but with a cost of 1,000 coins. Lastly, the third train arrives at Level 25, with a cost of 14,000 coins. Airport Once players reach Level 17, players are asked to repair the Airport. This costs 1,500 coins. Once the Airport is repaired, they are then asked to fill up crates, and are rewarded XP and coins. There is the option to ask for help, although you are only allowed to ask 1 time per row. Airplanes will automatically be sent off 15 hours after they open if you do not press the send button. The airplane will open 5 hours after the send button is pressed, or when the airplane is automatically sent off. A new plane will not be opened until the game is opened again. In the 5 hours before the airplane arrives again, there is a box in the right hand corner that allows players preview items that would be needed for the next airplane, intended to allow players to have a headstart. Mine Once players reach Level 21, they are asked to repair the Mine for 3,000 coins. Once the Mine is built, 1 day and 6 hours later, the mine can be dug using pickaxes, dynamites, and TNT's taken from trains, Zoo orders (see below), chests, the House of Luck, the City Market, and in-app purchases. These tools are used to mine ores, of which there are four of them. Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum, in which with each one named, the rarity grows. You can use these ores to make ingots at the Foundry. At Level 58, clay is unlocked, in which you can only use pickaxes to mine. In addition to all of those, you can also find Artifacts (which you can use at the Museum and earn cas), gems, a package of coins (usually 50-350 coins), a message in a bottle containing random rewards, cash chests (which cost 3 Tcash to open), and free Treasure Chests. The ore mined is kept in the Warehouse Box, a \\"barn\\" in which there is no max capacity and of no relation to the barn outside of the mine. Zoo The Zoo is unlocked at Level 24, costing 5,000 coins to be built. 12 hours later, it is built, and there are orders which players can fill. Players are able to ask for help for 3 orders per day. They are not allowed to ask for help twice on one order. 48 animal families can be made, in which they can be unlocked using animal cards, which can be unlocked in a variety of ways. There are sets that come in different colors, showing the players the rarity of the card. There are 3 sets, Regular (Brown), for Parent Animals. 30 cards are needed to unlock each parent. The next set is Rare (Blue), for Baby Boy Animals. 15 cards are needed to unlock a baby boy. Lastly, there are Epic (Yellow), which are for Baby Girl Animals. 10 cards are needed to unlock a baby girl. Port At Level 29, the port is unlocked. This costs 8,000 coins to build and takes 2 days. There are four ships you can get in total, the first one being immediately available, the second one being immediately available, but costing 5,000 coins, (this is if the population is at least 2,050 people). At Level 32, a third ship is unlocked, with a cost of 8,000 coins, (the population must be 2,500 people this time). And lastly, a fourth ship is unlocked at Level 38, with a cost of 25,000 coins and a population of at least 3,500 people. There are four isles that can be unlocked. Frutus Isle is unlocked immediately, without any cost. Olivia Isle is unlocked at Level 35, costing 11,000 coins. Tropica Isle is unlocked at Level 41, with a cost of 15,000 coins. Lastly, Fisherman's Isle is unlocked at Level 52, costing 45,000 coins. These isles, after a certain amount of time, bring back goods. Ingots (see above), can increase the chances of getting rarer goods, and with at least one ingot, you can unlock a treasure chest, compassing miscellaneous rewards but also certain unique artifacts you can collect at the Museum. Social interaction Township encourages interactions between players through the social network Facebook. Keeping in touch with other players allows the player to develop the town faster by using friends’ help. In July 2015, a new update was released, introducing a zoo and the ability to donate to friends' planes and trains. Another way to interact with others is through co-ops, unlocked at level 19. You also get to participate in regatta races with your co-op to get rewards. Business model Township is a free-to-play game with many opportunities to pay for expedited construction, materials, decorations, or the game's in-game currency (Tcash). Players that don't have enough T-cash, or want more, can buy some using real money (in-app purchases). As with most \\"freemium\\" business models, players may purchase decorations and upgrades for their town, or coins and Township cash in order to buy more of the former.  Controversy  Township, along with other games by Playrix have been increasingly coming under criticism on the internet for displaying misleading advertisements that depict gameplay that is false and nothing like the game itself. Several Reddit forums are dedicated to this. For instance, many ads for Township depict action gameplay that is completely unlike the app itself.

Geography The fajã is situated between Fajã da Ponta Nova and Fajã da Fajanzinha at the mouth of the Ribeira das Queijadas, and can be reached by the E.R.1-2ª regional roadway, between the villages of Santo António and Norte Grande. It is not completely accessible by vehicles, but reachable by a trail beginning in Ermida (Santo António), that extends to the cliff. The trails then continues along a long, accented winding route down the escarpment, through stone staircases, to the isolated shoreline. Normally abandoned throughout the year, the residents of the Fajã d'Além normally return to the fajã in the summer months, resulting in a population of about 40 people.

Kigeli I together with his son Sekarongoro I staged a defensive fight against Cwamali's army around what is modern day Kigali city. Sekarongoro I Mutabazi got injured on the forehead and bled which led Rwanda army to retreat. King Kigeli I Mukobanya withdrew from his palace with his cows and re-positioned across Nyabarongo River.

It is an alternative for local authorities to borrowing via the Public Works Loan Board of the UK Debt Management Office, which in turn is part of UK Governments HM Treasury. History The official reason for the creation of the Local Capital Finance Company is that it increases competition and diversifies funding sources for local authorities, giving them greater independence. The company aims to deliver the larger, more liquid bond issues in response to capital market demand. It also provides a centre of expertise between local authorities and capital markets. On the other hand, there are fears that it is a means by which the British government can pretend that government debt is lower that it actually is. While all local government debt, whether sourced from the UK Debt Management Office or the open market, is included within measures of government debt, the force of the criticism is that by the nature of sovereign debt, no private issuer can have a lower risk premium than the sovereign issuer for the jurisdiction of the debt issued. Municipal bond agencies have a proven track record in other countries internationally. In countries such as Sweden and Finland they have arguably improved local government financing. As of February 2015, nearly 50 local authorities have signed up to the Local Capital Finance Company. Structure The Chairman of the LCF is Sir Merrick Cockell, who was previously head of the Local Government Association; its deputy chairman is Adrian Bell, head of Debt Markets UK for Canaccord Genuity in London;, its Chief Executive is Aidan Brady, who was previously a Chief Operating Officer at Deutsche Bank, an investment bank and its Interim Chief Risk Officer is Markus Krebsz.

The Palapa oath () was an oath taken by Gajah Mada, a 14th-century Prime Minister of the Javanese Majapahit Empire described in the Pararaton (Book of Kings). In this oath Gajah Mada swore that he would not taste any spice, as long as he had not succeeded in unifying Nusantara (the Indonesian archipelago). The oath was taken during his inauguration as Majapahit Amangkubhumi (Prime Minister) that took place in 1256 Saka (1334) or 1258 Saka (1336). The oath The main source of the Palapa oath is taken from the middle Javanese manuscript, Pararaton, which states: :Sira Gajah Madapatih Amangkubhumi tan ayun amuktia palapa, sira Gajah Mada: \\"Lamun huwus kalah nusantara isun amukti palapa, lamun kalah ring Gurun, ring Seran, Tañjung Pura, ring Haru, ring Pahang, Dompo, ring Bali, Sunda, Palembang, Tumasik, samana isun amukti palapa\\". Translation: :He, Gajah Mada Patih Amangkubumi, does not wish to cease his fasting. Gajah Mada: \\"If (I succeed) in defeating (conquering) Nusantara, (then) I will break my fast. If Gurun, Seram, Tanjung Pura, Haru, Pahang, Dompo, Bali, Sunda, Palembang, Temasek, are all defeated, (then) I will break my fast.\\".  Interpretation  The term palapa is an Old Javanese term for \\"coconut\\". It also might be used to refer to pala (nutmeg) to describe \\"spices\\" or flavourings in food. Palapa can also be interpreted as the combination pala-apa, which means any fruit or spices. The oath means that Gajah Mada would not eat palapa until he succeeded in uniting the Nusantara archipelago under Majapahit suzerainty. Historians have interpreted that Gajah Mada might have performed what is now known in Javanese tradition as puasa mutih, only consuming plain food of white steamed rice, plain vegetables and clear water, without any coconut or spices for flavouring. Some might also interpret this to mean Gajah Mada was somehow performing a somewhat ascetic ritual by refusing to indulge himself in sensual pleasures, which includes consuming spiced flavoursome food. This oath was probably meant to describe his seriousness and strong will in achieving his goal of furthering the glory of Majapahit. From this manuscript, historians have learnt several names of places and polities in Nusantara at the time the oath was taken, which were not under Majapahit suzerainty, and were targeted by Gajah Mada's ambitious expansive campaign.  Places described in Palapa oath  * Gurun = Gorom island, east of Seram * Seran = Seram * Tañjung Pura = Tanjungpura Kingdom, Ketapang Regency, West Kalimantan * Haru = Aru Kingdom North Sumatra (Karo) * Pahang = Pahang, Malaysia * Dompo = Dompu in Sumbawa island * Bali = Bali * Sunda = Sunda Kingdom * Palembang = Palembang or Srivijaya * Tumasik = Singapore Legacy The Palapa oath is used as the name of the Indonesian telecommunication satellite Palapa, a Boeing-made satellite. The program was started in February 1975 and the satellite was launched on 9 July 1976, from Cape Caneveral, United States. The name Palapa was chosen by President Suharto and means 'fruits of labor', also signifying the Indonesian effort to unify the Indonesian archipelago through telecommunication technology.

He has been involved with FlyBoard since it was invented by a French watercraft rider, Franky Zapata in spring 2011 and has actively taken part in the growth of FlyBoard. He has taken part in all World Championships to date, Qatar (2012), Qatar (2013) and Dubai (2014). His best result was in 2012 when he came in 5th place, disqualified by a head-to-head battle in quarterfinals by Stephane Prayas from France, who went on to become the World Champion of that year. He lives and trains on Ibiza where he is sponsored and is image for the Ushuaïa beach hotel, Maremoto Jets, SEA-DOO Watercraft, Alkkemist premium Gin and FlyBoard Spain. Early life and education At age 5 he started waterskiing at the Cable Ski Benidorm in his home town in Benidorm (Alicante) and at age 8 he started to compete for the Spanish Waterski team in the category of Slalom achieving various Spanish champion titles. At age 13 he moved to Nottingham, UK to study. After finishing his studies at Carlton le Willows school he moved back to Spain where at age 19 started waterskiing professionally again and working as an instructor at Cerro de Alarcón waterski school in Madrid where amongst other personalities he gave lessons to the present king of Spain SM Felipe VI. He was also one of the first Wakeboarder's in Spain and was the winner of the first Spanish national Wakeboard Championship held at Casa de Campo, Madrid. At age 29 he moved to Ibiza, Spain where he continued with businesses related to watersports and in beginning of 2012 when French watercraft rider Franky Zapata invented the FlyBoard he signed the exclusivity for Spain and has dedicated his life to this sport ever since. FlyBoard shows Thanks to his past experience in Waterskiing and Wakeboarding he quickly progressed and self-taught himself with the FlyBoard and is now a reference for the sport. After the first FlyBoard World cup held in Dubai, 2012 he became part of a select group of riders that made a series of FlyBoard shows around the world. At the training sessions for one of the shows at KaruJet in Guadeloupe, Caribbean, he was one of the 5 riders (Patrick Esnard, John Albinson, Emmanuel Jules, Stephane Prayas) that decided to experiment the use of the FlyBoard without the arm stabilizers that where originally invented by Franky Zapata, soon after this the decision was taken to use the FlyBoard without arm stabilizers. In September 2013 this group of riders was to hold a show in Azerbaijan for the Minister of Sports, on arrival and unexpectedly, early elections where announced and because of this the show was canceled because it was not allowed to make shows in public areas. As a result, the team had the idea to make the show in a private place, in this case was the hotel swimming pool. This was one of the first FlyBoard Show's in a swimming pool. Lindsay McQueen performed what would be the first backflip with a FlyBoard in the world inside a swimming pool. At the hotel the team met professional Saxophonist Anastasia Zhukouskaya and had the idea for her to play the Saxophone on the FlyBoard as part of the show. Flyboard shows are very popular in the most popular events, weddings, beach and night clubs around the world. Lindsay McQueen is one of the most experienced FlyBoard Showmen in the world and makes regular shows during the summer months at some of the best clubs and events in Ibiza. McQueen has also appeared on various TV commercials and TV programs like Vodafone, Heineken, Hormiguero with Tom Cruise, Les Princes de l'Amour and more. =Some of McQueen's flyBoard shows= *Heineken show * Destino ibiza day FlyBoard Saxophone show with Anastasia McQueen * Destino ibiza Night FlyBoard Saxophone Show with Anastasia McQueen *Tron show at Lio ibiza * 52 Series show ibiza with Anastasia McQueen * Zensa Denia * Ocean Club ibiza Performances and media =Competitions= *1988.

Emperor Nicholas I of Russia established the award in 1831 as the Imperial and Royal Order of the White Eagle. A recipient of the Order was granted the title Knight of the Order of the White Eagle. Background The \\"white eagle\\" has been associated with Poland even prior to statehood; first appearing on the Polish Coat of Arms in the 13th century. The original Order of the White Eagle () was reputedly established by King Władysław I in 1325. There is no evidence of it being awarded, however, until 1705 under Augustus II the Strong, King of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, the Order of the White Eagle briefly disappeared along with the Polish monarchy. After his death in 1798, Empress Alexandra wore the Collar of the Grand Master of the Order at Nicholas’s coronation as King of Poland. The order was resurrected in 1807 by Napoleon I in his short- lived Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna divided the historically Polish lands among Prussia, the Austrian Empire and the Russian Empire. The majority of the territory was renamed the Kingdom of Poland and was to be an autonomous part of the Russian Empire. The Order of the White Eagle is mentioned as belonging to the Kingdom of Poland in its constitution of 1815: During the years immediately following the Congress of Vienna, the badge and cross of the Order were awarded with the same Polish insignia, but the majority of the recipients were Russians or members of the Austrian Empire. After Russian troops put down the Polish uprising of 1830-31, Nicholas I stripped the autonomy from the Kingdom of Poland and adopted all Polish orders of merit. Order within the Russian Empire The badge of the Order of the White Eagle, 1863 The Order of the White Eagle was officially \\"annexed\\" by Nicholas I on 17 November 1831 and became part of the Russian Imperial honors system. Among the first recipients of the Imperial Order of the White Eagle were Ivan Paskevich and Pyotr Petrovich Palen, recognised for their part in suppressing the Polish uprising. The new design featured significant alterations: the badge was now of gold and red enamel; on the front, the original red maltese cross and white eagle were reduced in size and superimposed over the double-headed eagle of the Russian Empire. The back of the badge featured the original Polish badge design, superimposed over the Russian imperial eagle. The star now featured the Russian royal crown. On 25 January 1832, a blue ribbon and sash were introduced. The Order of the White Eagle was given a high status in the hierarchy of distinction, ranked only behind the Order of Saint Andrew, the Order of Saint Catherine (for women only) and the Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky. As the top three awards were named after Russian Orthodox saints, the Order of the White Eagle was the preferred award to bestow upon non-Christians.

It originally aired on February 4, 2015 in the United States on FX. Plot Elizabeth Jennings (Keri Russell) arrives at the hotel where Annelise (Gillian Alexy) was murdered. She and Philip (Matthew Rhys) dispose of her body by breaking her limbs and stuffing her into a suitcase. Arriving in a crate to the FBI, Zinaida Preobrazhenskaya (Svetlana Efremova), a defector from the Institute for US and Canadian Studies, is greeted by Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich). Nina Sergeevna (Annet Mahendru), who is incarcerated at the Lefortovo Prison for treason, gets a frightened cell mate, Evi Sneijder (Katja Herbers), but Nina refuses to speak with her. Zinaida Preobrazhenskaya discusses with Stan the Institute in Moscow she worked for, where their duties were to report on Soviet leadership on all aspects of geopolitical significance regarding the U.S. and Canada. She confides in Stan that she is glad that it is over, but he assures her that it is not. In a flashback to her childhood, Elizabeth remembers her mother telling her that her father was a deserter who was shot and killed. Philip meets Yousaf (Rahul Khanna) and they briefly discuss Annelise. Philip tells Yousaf that he needs the names of members working in the CIA Afghanistan group, when Philip suggests he arrange a meeting with them. Stan is held at gunpoint by Oleg Igorevich Burov (Costa Ronin), who blames him for Nina's arrest and upcoming execution. Stan tells him that he loved Nina and, if Oleg wants to shoot him, he can shoot him in the back and Stan walks away. Philip confronts Elizabeth about her plan to induct Paige (Holly Taylor) into the KGB and talks about Annelise's death, saying it could happen to Paige. A distraught Stan visits with Sandra (Susan Misner) to discuss being held up. She comforts him, but tells him she is not coming back to him. Philip and Elizabeth make arrangements for Yousaf's meeting, in which Philip will identify the members of the Afghan group and their license plates. At a motel, in separate rooms, Philip and Elizabeth monitor the meeting; but, when Yousaf and an unidentified man get into a car, Elizabeth tails them, against Philip's wishes. They meet up and Elizabeth tells Philip that they need to go to the bar themselves where the meeting takes place, where Philip takes photographs of the meeting. Nina has a meeting with Oleg's father, who tells her that Oleg has asked for his help in saving her. She asks him to deliver a message that she was not pretending when they were together. At their office, Philip and Elizabeth discuss what they will do about Paige. Elizabeth tells him of the day she broke the rules and told her mother she was recruited; her mother did not blink and told her to serve her country.

Spectrometer is a broad term often used to describe instruments that measure a continuous variable of a phenomenon where the spectral components are somehow mixed. In visible light a spectrometer can separate white light and measure individual narrow bands of color, called a spectrum. A mass spectrometer measures the spectrum of the masses of the atoms or molecules present in a gas. The first spectrometers were used to split light into an array of separate colors. Spectrometers were developed in early studies of physics, astronomy, and chemistry. The capability of spectroscopy to determine chemical composition drove its advancement and continues to be one of its primary uses. Spectrometers are used in astronomy to analyze the chemical composition of stars and planets, and spectrometers gather data on the origin of the universe. Examples of spectrometers are devices that separate particles, atoms, and molecules by their mass, momentum, or energy. These types of spectrometers are used in chemical analysis and particle physics. Types of spectrometer =Optical spectrometers or Optical Emission Spectrometer= Spectrum of light emitted by a deuterium lamp in the UV, visible and near infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Optical absorption spectrometers Optical spectrometers (often simply called \\"spectrometers\\"), in particular, show the intensity of light as a function of wavelength or of frequency. The different wavelengths of light are separated by refraction in a prism or by diffraction by a diffraction grating. Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy is an example. These spectrometers utilize the phenomenon of optical dispersion. The light from a source can consist of a continuous spectrum, an emission spectrum (bright lines), or an absorption spectrum (dark lines). Because each element leaves its spectral signature in the pattern of lines observed, a spectral analysis can reveal the composition of the object being analyzed. OpenStax, Astronomy. OpenStax. 13 October 2016. Optical emission spectrometers Optical emission spectrometers (often called \\"OES or spark discharge spectrometers\\"), is used to evaluate metals to determine the chemical composition with very high accuracy. A spark is applied through a high voltage on the surface which vaporizes particles into a plasma. The particles and ions then emit radiation that is measured by detectors (photomultiplier tubes) at different characteristic wavelengths. =Electron spectroscopy= Some forms of spectroscopy involve analysis of electron energy rather than photon energy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is an example. =Mass spectrometer= A mass spectrometer is an analytical instrument that is used to identify the amount and type of chemicals present in a sample by measuring the mass-to-charge ratio and abundance of gas-phase ions. Time- of-flight spectrometer The energy spectrum of particles of known mass can also be measured by determining the time of flight between two detectors (and hence, the velocity) in a time-of-flight spectrometer. Alternatively, if the velocity is known, masses can be determined in a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Magnetic spectrometer A positive charged particle moving in a circle under the influence of the Lorentz force F When a fast charged particle (charge q, mass m) enters a constant magnetic field B at right angles, it is deflected into a circular path of radius r, due to the Lorentz force. The momentum p of the particle is then given by : p = mv = qBr, Focus of a magnetic semicircular spectrometerwhere m and v are mass and velocity of the particle. The focusing principle of the oldest and simplest magnetic spectrometer, the semicircular spectrometer,Jan Kazimierz Danysz, Le Radium 9, 1 (1912); 10, 4 (1913) invented by J. K. Danisz, is shown on the left. A constant magnetic field is perpendicular to the page. Charged particles of momentum p that pass the slit are deflected into circular paths of radius r = p/qB. It turns out that they all hit the horizontal line at nearly the same place, the focus; here a particle counter should be placed. Varying B, this makes possible to measure the energy spectrum of alpha particles in an alpha particle spectrometer, of beta particles in a beta particle spectrometer,K. Siegbahn, Alpha-, Beta- and Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy, North-Holland Publishing Co. Amsterdam (1966) of particles (e.g., fast ions) in a particle spectrometer, or to measure the relative content of the various masses in a mass spectrometer. Since Danysz' time, many types of magnetic spectrometers more complicated than the semicircular type have been devised. Resolution Generally, the resolution of an instrument tells us how well two close-lying energies (or wavelengths, or frequencies, or masses) can be resolved. Generally, for an instrument with mechanical slits, higher resolution will mean lower intensity.

Bob DeNatale first entered the creative scene as an editor and writer for Marvel Comics. Starting in 1983 and continuing through 1991, DeNatale edited The Amazing Spider-Man, The Spectacular Spider-Man, and Marvel Team-Up. Although editing Spider-Man was his primary focus, during his time at Marvel, DeNatale also wrote for Dazzler, and edited Marvel Super Special #34, an adaptation of the Sheena, Queen of the Jungle film. Following his departure from Marvel Comics, DeNatale focused on his career in butoh, the avant-garde Japanese dance art. In 1992, DeNatale founded the Flesh & Blood Mystery Theater to spread the art of butoh. Performing throughout the United States, Flesh & Blood Mystery Theater was a regular participant in the San Francisco Butoh Festival of which DeNatale was an Associate Producer. DeNatale's other butoh credits include performing in the film Oakland Underground (2006) and touring Germany and Poland with Ex…it! ’99 International Dance Festival. During the late 1990s, DeNatale co-founded the performance group XSX with former members of the bands Vivisection and Her Majesty the Baby. He later served as the lead singer for the punk art band Kill The Messenger from 1986 to 1989. In the 2000s, DeNatale's creativity embarked on a new path as he began working in film. His first film, a short entitled Prospect Park, Cleaning (2009), featured three butoh dancers improvising on a sunny day in Prospect Park, Brooklyn. His second short, Tales of Creation (2011), which questioned whether hearing voices was God, the Devil, or insanity, was an Official Selection of the 2011 New Filmmakers New York Festival. DeNatale's third project, The Art of Dreaming (2013), was a Semi-Finalist of the 2013 Moondance International Film Festival. DeNatale is currently working on his first feature film, Kim.

They were first installed in 1952 and are based on air raid sirens with the intention of warning residents living near the high-security psychiatric hospital of an escaped patient.  History  The Broadmoor Sirens were installed in 1952 in response to a patient escaping from Broadmoor and murdering a child in Farley Hill, Berkshire before being recaptured. They are similar to air-raid sirens but employ shutters to produce an alternating \\"high - low\\" warning tone. More sirens were added in the 1960s after discussions in the House of Commons raised the issue that the sirens' radius was insufficient for nearby towns such as Camberley and Wokingham. The thirteen sirens, labelled A–M to distinguish each unit, were created with the intention of warning residents in surrounding towns and villages to remain in their homes and keep their children supervised following the escape of a Broadmoor patient. The sirens are activated as a test at 10am every Monday to ensure they are working. The sirens are susceptible to electrical interference. In 2014, the Bracknell siren was activated accidentally during an electrical storm. The thirteen satellite sirens are due to be decommissioned during 2018, with one siren remaining in the hospital grounds.  Future  The last time the Broadmoor Sirens were activated because of an escape was in 1991, although they were activated in 1993 because of an attack at the hospital. In 2014, there were plans to remove seven of the thirteen sirens. This was because Broadmoor had added a second security fence around the hospital and intended to upgrade the remainder of the sirens so they had a radius to improve on the two-mile radius of the 1952 sirens. Local residents objected to this on safety grounds due to there being sixteen primary schools within the radius of the sirens. It was reported on 2 June 2016 that the hospital plans to have twelve (possibly all thirteen) sirens scrapped by 2018 in favour of escape alerts via the internet and Twitter.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/02/broadmoors-plans-to- replace-warning-sirens-with-twitter-alerts-n/ As of 2020, most of the original sirens have been removed from their locations, with the rest remaining idle. In late 2019 a newer siren was installed in an unknown location on the hospital grounds.

His ghost then haunts the priest and demands to be resurrected. Kwan Wei Long, a serial killer, enters the town looking to duel with Pang and is seemingly killed by him. Happy to find a suitable corpse, Wu Lung attempts to put Lu Dai's spirit into Long's body. Long, however, is so evil that he is reanimated as a free-willed vampire.

Following are the major areas of interest of the group *Mobile robots that can operate various outdoor terrain conditions-commonly termed as \\"All Terrain robots\\"http://www.cmeri.res.in/rnd/srlab/index.htm *Aerial Robots *Robots which use body movement for locomotion *Amphibious robots which can operate in land, partial & fully submerged terrain The key element of mobile robotics capability involves: *Guidance and Navigation *Command and Control architecture *Integration and Fusion of multiple sensory information *Behavior based and Learning System Completed Projects *All Terrain Robot (ATR X50) is primarily a tracked mobile robot designed & developed to cater the need for strategic requirements of India. This project attempts to analyze a few scientific and technological challenges often encountered by the navigation and robotics research community. The system is capable of operating in hostile environment for intervention, exploration, and data collection. The technology and expertise developed through this project will have many applications. *Sub Terranean robot has been invented in Surface Robotics Laboratory of CMERI which can move both on land and under water. Its application is to run inside coal mines.It is usually hazardous inside coal mines where deaths often occur owing to accidents inside mines. Hence instead of human beings, this robot may be used inside mines so that there is no chance of life risk even if an accident occurs under the mines.SR is remotely operated. The remote consists of a laptop in which an application program is used to run it. A wireless modem is attached on the top of the SR for communication between the SR and the laptop. * Autonomous robot on intelligent behaviour is entirely designed and built in Surface Robotics Laboratory of CMERI.The purpose of this robot is to gather intelligence and the information namely for searching,scanning,detecting,recording & surveveillance. The project is mainly based on microcontroller and sensors. * Modified All Terranean Robot also known as ATR II has been designed & developed in Surface Robotics Laboratory of CMERI. From the need of introducing mobile robot technology in India, the project All Terrain Robot (ATR) was taken up. *The main objective of Autonomous Intelligent Robotic Wheel Chair is to design and develop the technology to provide comfort, independence of mobility & utilize the advantage of robotics technology for physically challenged persons. *Outdoor mobile robot (OMR) was proposed for explosive detection capability with autonomous navigation on rough terrain. It is a four-wheel drive system with tracked configuration. The four separate drive units are constructed by means of a motor, bevel gears, sprocket-chain and wheels. The drive unit drives the ground wheel by means of a roller chain. The whole load of the system is distributed on three ground wheels. *Serpentine robot that is being built is a biologically inspired robot and has got its inspiration from the snake and its method of locomotion.The robot snake measures 807 mm in length, from head to tail, and is 2-1/2 inches wide. The robot consists of six body segments with one head and one tail module with each segment being powered by an R/C servo. The segments alternate in orientation so that the first segment moves in horizontal motion and the next segment moves in vertical motion. The sequence repeats itself for all six segments and a head. This gives the snake enough flexibility to move its body in a number of different ways in order to achieve locomotion, in much the same way as a biological snake.

It consists of three separate areas, along with several smaller ones. The largest is centered on Lake Tuz, and also includes the middle reach of the Kizilirmak River. The second area is the Karapınar and Konya Plains south of Lake Tuz. The Obruk Plateau separates the Lake Tuz basin from the Karapınar and Konya plains. The third area lies in the middle valleys of the Sakarya and Porsuk rivers northwest of Lake Tuz, as they curve around the eastern end of the Sündiken Mountains. The ecoregion consists mostly of plains and river valleys, with an average elevation of 1,000 m. Mountains and plateaus define the edges of the ecoregion. Lake Tuz lies in a closed basin, fed by seasonal streams descending from the surrounding plateaus. The average elevation of the lake is 829 m. In the summer months, the lake mostly dries up, exposing salt flats. During the winter months the lake refills and expands.

Climate The ecoregion has a continental climate, with hot and dry summers and cold winters. The ecoregion is semi-arid, and annual precipitation ranges from 400 to 500 mm, and as low as 300 mm in some rain shadow areas. Flora Lake Tuz is surrounded by salt steppe, composed of salt-tolerant (halophytic) low shrubs and herbaceous plants, including many from the Chenopodiaceae and Plumbaginaceae families. The most salt-tolerant plants grow closest to the center of the lake, with less salt-tolerant plants occupying higher areas. Lake Tuz' saline steppes are home to many endemic species. The Karapınar Plain includes areas of salt steppe around smaller saline lakes, seasonal freshwater wetlands, and upland steppes characterized by Limonium anatolicum, with Petrosimonia brachiata, Alhagi pseudoalhagi, Salsola crassa, Petrosimonia nigeensis, and Frankenia hirsuta. Fauna The ecoregion's salt lakes and freshwater wetlands are home to large populations of water birds, including resident and breeding birds and winter migrants. A subspecies of Asian short-toed lark (Alaudala cheleensis ssp. niethammeri), inhabits the barren fringes of the ecoregion's salt and soda lakes. Steppe bird species include the great bustard (Otis tarda) and little bustard (Tetrax tetrax). Mammal species of the salt steppe include Williams' jerboa (Allactaga williamsi), Anatolian ground squirrel (Spermophilus xanthoprymnus), Turkish hamster (Mesocricetus brandtii), Eurasian badger (Meles meles), and marbled polecat (Vormela peregusna).

It is located in high plateau of Eastern Anatolia, covering parts of eastern Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, southern Georgia, and northwestern Iran. Geography The ecoregion occupies the Armenian Highlands, a plateau lying mostly between 1500 to 2500 meters elevation. The volcanic peaks Mount Ararat (5137 m) and Mount Süphan (4058 m) rise above the plateau.It covers portions of eastern Turkey, eastern and southern Armenia, Azerbaijan's Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, the Javakheti region of southern Georgia, and northwestern Iran. The highlands are bounded on the northeast by the Lesser Caucasus, on the northwest by the Pontic Mountains, and on the south by the Zagros Mountains. To the east the plateau descends towards the Aras-Kura lowlands, and in the Aras valley the ecoregion descends to 375 meters elevation. The northern part of the ecoregion is in the watershed of the upper Aras River, which includes Lake Sevan in Armenia. The Aras empties into the Kura River, which then drains into the Caspian Sea. The ecoregion includes closed basins of Lake Van in eastern Turkey, Lake Urmia in northwestern Iran. The cities of Tabriz, Erzerum, and Yerevan are located in the ecoregion. Climate The climate is continental, with warm summers and cold winters. Annual precipitation ranges from 400 to 600 meters, and generally falls evenly throughout the year. Rainfall is lower (200–300 mm annually) in the rain shadow of the high mountains. Strong and cold winds are frequent, particularly on exposed ridges and peaks, and can limit the growth of trees. Flora Plant communities include desert steppe, semi-desert steppe, mountain steppe, woodland, alpine, and wetlands. Desert steppe is found in the driest areas, and consists of low xerophytic plants covering 25-30% of the ground. The semi-desert steppe consists of low annual herbs and grasses, including Artemisia fragrans, Capparis spinosa, Bassia prostrata, and Poa bulbosa. Mountain steppes consist of herbs, shrubs, and grasses, which grow higher and are more diverse than the desert and semi-desert steppes. From 1500 to 2200 meters elevation, the main plant associations are cushion-like formations of Artemisia austriaca and Artemisia fragrans or species of Astragalus, Acantholimon, and Onobrychis, or grasslands of Poa bulbosa and species of Stipa, Festuca, and Bassia. From 2200 to 2700 meters elevation, umbellifers of genera Ferula and Prangos are common. Open steppe woodlands are predominantly of juniper (Juniperus) and almond (Amygdalus'). The trees form a sparse canopy, underneath which is a shrub layer of Pistacia, Berberis, and Rosa, and an herb layer with speies of Astragalus and Artemisia. Scattered areas of oak woodland occur between 800 and 2000 meters elevation where moisture and soils are favorable. Wetlands occur around the ecoregion's lakes and streams. Wetland vegetation is predominantly reeds and rushes, including common reed (Phragmites australis), cattails (Typha spp.), the rush Scirpus tabernaemontani, and the sedges Carex acuta, C. diluta, and Bolboschoenus maritimus. Alpine plant communities are found on the high peaks, including Ararat and Süphan. Characteristic plants are herbs and geophytes, with species of Draba, Dracocephalum, Oxyria, Polygonum, Veronica, Trollius, Scilla, Primula, and Gentiana verna. Fauna Large mammals include Brown bear (Ursus arctos), gray wolf (Canis lupus), striped hyena (Hyena hyena), and wild goat (Capra aegagrus). Protected areas A 2017 assessment found that 8,202 km², or 5%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas include Charoimagh Protected Area, Sahand Protected Area, Marakan Protected Area, and Kiamaky Wildlife Refuge in Iran, Sevan National Park, Lake Arpi National Park, and Khosrov Forest State Reserve in Armenia, Mount Ararat (Ağrı Dağı) National Park and Süphan Dağı in Turkey, and Arpachay State Nature Sanctuary in Azerbaijan.

Lebanon cedar (Cedrus libani) is a characteristic tree. Geography The ecoregion covers an area of , in portions of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel. The ecoregion lies mainly in the Taurus Mountains, which run through southern Anatolia roughly parallel to the coast. The Taurus is divided into three sub-ranges – the Western, or Isaurian, Taurus (highest peak Mt. Kizlarsivrisi ); the Central, or Lycian, Taurus (highest peak Medetsiz ); and the Eastern, or Cilician, Taurus (highest peak Demirkazık ). The ecoregion also includes the higher-elevation portions of the Nur Mountains (or Amanos) along the western Turkey-Syria border, and the Levantine Syrian Coastal Mountains, Lebanon Mountains, and Anti-Lebanon Mountains, which run parallel to the eastern Mediterranean shore in Syria, Lebanon, and northernmost Israel. The highest peak in the Nur mountains is Bozdağ (), and the highest peak in the Levantine mountains is Qurnat as Sawda' in Lebanon (). Limestone is the most common rock, with areas of serpentinite and other ophiolitic rocks. Temperate-climate forests and steppes lie to the north on the Anatolian plateaus. The Mediterranean-climate Eastern Mediterranean conifer- sclerophyllous-broadleaf forests ecoregion lies along the Mediterranean coastal lowlands, in the Levantine lowlands and foothills, and to the east. Climate The ecoregion has a montane Mediterranean climate. Average annual precipitation ranges from 800 to 2000 mm. Winter is the wettest season, and summer is the driest. Rain-bearing winds generally come from the southwest winds, and south and west-facing slopes generally have higher rainfall than north and east-facing ones. Average temperatures vary with elevation, and higher elevations experience cool temperatures and regular winter frosts and snows. Proximity to the sea moderates winter temperatures, and interior regions have a more continental climate with colder winters. Flora The main plant communities are conifer forests, broadleaf deciduous forests, and alpine meadows and shrublands. Conifer forests are the most widespread. Turkish black pine (Pinus nigra), Lebanon cedar (Cedrus libani), Taurus fir (Abies cilicica), and juniper (Juniperus foetidissima and Juniperus excelsa) are the most common conifers. Junipers grow close to the treeline, which is at approximately 2000 meters elevation near the coast, and 2400 meters elevation in drier inland areas. Deciduous forests are concentrated in areas with higher rainfall (1,500-2,000 mm) facing the prevailing southwest winds, notably the Geyik Mountains in the Western Taurus and the Nur Mountains in the east. Deciduous broadleaf trees are predominant, including Oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis), European hop-hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia), oaks (Quercus cerris, Q. libani, Q. trojana, and Q. petraea ssp. pinnatiloba), and maples (Acer hyrcanum, A. platanoides, A. campestre, and A. monspessulanum). The dry alpine meadows are characterized by low-growing subshrubs, tufted herbaceous plants, grasses, and geophytes, including many species of Astragalus. Protected areas Protected areas in the Western Taurus include Çığlıkara Nature Reserve, near Elmalı, Antalya Province, which protects 15,889 ha of Cedrus libani forest. The protected area around the coastal mountain of Babadağ, near Fethiye in Muğla Province, includes montane forests of Acer undulatum, which is endemic to the mountain, along with Cedrus libani, Abies cilicica, Pinus brutia, and junipers, and maquis at lower elevations.Mansourian, Stephanie & Rossi, Magali & Vallauri, Daniel.

It has a Mediterranean climate, and is part of the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome. Geography The ecoregion covers the mountains and plateaus of southwestern Turkey. To the west, the Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests ecoregion covers the foothills and coastal plains along the Aegean Sea. On the north, the Anatolian conifer and deciduous forests extend to the southern shore of the Sea of Marmara. On the northeast, the ecoregion transitions to the more humid and temperate Euxine-Colchic broadleaf forests. To the east is Central Anatolia, which has a drier and more continental climate, and home to conifer forests, dry deciduous broadleaf forests, and steppes. The Southern Anatolian montane conifer and deciduous forests occupy the Taurus Mountains in the south and southeast. The highest peak is Uludağ (2,543 m), south of the Sea of Marmara. Kazdağı (Mount Ida) is in the northwest near the Aegean shore. Other mountain ranges include the Sündiken Mountains in the northeast, and the Boz Mountains and Aydin Mountains in the southwest. The Büyük Menderes and Gediz rivers originate in the central portion of the ecoregion, and flow westwards to empty into the Aegean. The northern-central portion of the ecoregion is drained by the Simav River, which empties northwards into the Sea of Marmara. The Sakarya River and its tributaries drain the northeast. The southeastern portion of the ecoregion includes several closed basins that drain into saline or soda lakes, including Lake Burdur, Lake Acıgöl, and Lake Işıklı. Climate The ecoregion has a Mediterranean climate, with hot dry summers and rainy winters. Average annual precipitation generally ranges from 400 to 600 mm. The climate is varies from east to west and north to south. Winters are milder and rainfall is generally higher where the climatic influence of the Mediterranean Sea is strongest, and while the eastern and northern portions of the ecoregion closer to Central Anatolia have a more continental climate, with colder winters and lower rainfall. Flora The predominant plant communities in the ecoregion are forests of pines and deciduous broadleaf trees, chiefly oaks. Forests of Turkish pine (Pinus brutia) occur in the western foothills and inland depressions. Turkish pine is a characteristic tree of Western Turkey's lowland Mediterranean forests. Pinus brutia forests include the oaks Quercus cerris, Q. ithaburensis ssp. macrolepis, and Q. cocifera. Anatolian black pine (P. nigra ssp. pallasiana) is more widespread, particularly in the drier east and above 1000 meters elevation. Pure stands are common above 1000 meters elevation, and sparse forests of Anatolian black pine and juniper are found at high elevations near the treeline. Below 1000 meters elevation, Anatolian black pine occurs in mixed forests with P. brutia, Quercus spp., and Juniperus spp. In the eastern mountains around 1000 meters elevation, mixed stands of P. nigra, Quercus cerris, Q. pubescens, and Q. robur subsp. robur also include many typical Anatolian steppe plants, like Pyrus elaeagrifolia, Prunus spinosa, Crateagus spp., and shrubs and herbaceous plants. Oaks occur in pine forests, and as the dominant tree in some areas. Quercus cerris is the most widespread of the oaks. Other oaks are Q. pubescens, especially in steppe edges and on degraded sites, and Q. ithaburensis subsp. macrolepis, Q. trojana, Q. robur subsp. robur, and Q. frainetto. In humid areas, particulary along streams and in the mountains south of the Sea of Marmara, oaks form mixed forests with other deciduous trees, including oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis), sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa), Juglans regia, and oriental beech (Fagus orientalis), along with the Turkish fir (Abies bornmuelleriana or Abies nordmanniana subsp. bornnmuelleriana) on Uludağ. The Trojan fir (Abies equi-trojani or Abies nordmanniana subsp. equi-trojani) is endemic to Kaz Dağı (Mount Ida), where it covers 282.5 ha in pure stands, and 3309 ha mixed with Anatolian black pine and Oriental beech. Fauna Brown bear (Ursus arctos) and grey wolf (Canis lupus) are found around Uludağ. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) are more widespread. Protected areas Protected areas in the ecoregion include Manyas Bird Paradise National Park, Uludağ National Park, Kazdağı National Park, Troy Historical National Park, Gürgendağı Nature Reserve, Vakıf Çamlığı Nature Reserve, and Dandindere Nature Reserve. Kazdağı National Park and Gürgendağ Nature Reserve are located on Kazdağı (Mount Ida) in the northwest.

They can grow to a length of . Distribution Hologymnosus doliatus is found in the Indian and Pacific Oceans from East Africa to South Africa east to Samoa and the Line Islands,, north to Japan and south to the Great Barrier Reef, Lord Howe Island and New Caledonia. In Western Australia it reaches as far south as Ningaloo Reef. Habitat and biology Hologymnosus doliatus occurs in seaward reefs where there is mixed sand, rubble and coral at depths which extend to at least . Juveniles live in groups close to the bottom while the adults occur high above the bottom. The females are also normally found in small groups while the males are solitary and territorial, guarding a large section of reef. This carnivorous species feeds mostly on fishes, which make up 50% of their diet and crustacean, especially shrimps, they will also feed on brittlestars and polychaete worms. Species description and taxonomy Hologymnosus doliatus was originally, formally described as Labrus doliatus in 1801 by Bernard Germain de Lacépède in Volume 5 of his Histoire naturelle des poissons based on a drawing by the French explorer and naturalist Philibert Commerson (1727-1773). In 1801 Lacépède created the genus Hologymnosus and designated a species, Hologymnosus fasciatus, he had just described as its type species, this was later shown to be a synonym of H. doliatus. Human usage Hologymnosus doliatus is collected for the aquarium trade and is taken by small scale, subsistence fisheries.

Description Iniistius pavo can be identified by the dark vertical bar situated below the eye. This species has a small dark spot below the forward portion of the dorsal fin, a white patch behind the side behind the pectoral fin, and an oblique brown bar underneath the eye. It normally shows 5 dark bars when adult when the belly of female turns red. Juveniles have a black anal fin and two large eyespots which have narrow white margins in their dorsal fin. The first two spines in the dorsal fin form a separate fin. It has a highly compressed body and a steep, sharp-edged forehead, like other members of the genus Iniistius. In juveniles this separate fin formed by the first two spines takes the form of a long, bannerlike filament but as the fish ages this shortens. The colour of the juveniles varies from whitish with dark bars on the body, to an overall brown colour. The small juveniles drift in the water mimicking leaves and debris. This fish may attain a total length of . Distribution Iniistius pavo has an Indo-Pacific distribution which extends from the Red Sea and the east African coast as far south as KwaZulu-Natal eastwards to the Society Islands, north to southern Japan and Hawaii and south to New Caledonia, Lord Howe Island and New South Wales.. It also occurs in the Eastern Pacific from the Gulf of California to Panama and the Galapagos Islands. Habitat and biology Iniistius pavo is normally found as a solitary, benthic and benthopelagic species in lagoon and seaward reef areas where the substrate consists of fine to loose, coarse sand. The juveniles are sometimes recorded in shallow estuaries. The adults are rare in water which is less than . The species dives into the sand to sleep securely at night and also will go this to hide when threatened, using the sharp edge to the snout to speedily bury itself.. It feeds on hard-shelled invertebrates, such as molluscs and crustaceans. The juveniles use the elongated, detached front portion of their dorsal fin to impersonate drifting dead leaves. Species description and taxonomy Iniistius pavo was formally described as Xyrichtys pavo in 1840 with the type locality given as Mauritius. When Theodore Nicholas Gill erected the genus Iniistius he named this species as the type species. Human usage Iniistius pavo is not a commercially exploited quarry species, its flesh is said to be highly palatable and when large enough fish are caught they may be marketed. It is occasionally collected for the aquarium trade.

She is played by Paola Barrientos, both as an adult and, in flashbacks, as a teenager. Barrientos. received the Tato Award and the Martín Fierro Award for her work. Fictional biography Victoria Lauría was the best friend of María Laura Falsini (Nancy Dupláa) in high school. She had a crush on fellow student Guillermo Almada (Juan Gil Navarro). Lauría and Falsini stayed as friends and confidants after graduation, and Lauría became a psychologist. Her crush on Almada ended during a meeting of former students, several years later, when he came out of the closet and revealed that he was gay. Lauría stayed as Almada's friend, and helped him with his adoptive daughter. Eventually, she fell in love with Tuca (Mex Urtizberea), another former high school student. Character creation Initially, Victoria Lauría was meant to be played by Julieta Ortega. However, Ortega was reassigned to the role of Verónica Diorio after Verónica Lozano turned down that role. Nancy Dupláa, the lead actress of the telenovela, proposed the actress Paola Barrientos for the character. She was advised by a friend, fellow actress Andrea Pietra, who had seen Barrientos at the theater play Estado de Ira (). Paola Barrientos became famous with her work as the character. Paola Barrientos commented that she proposed her own ideas and input for the design of the character, expanding the initial draft. She included her own views about psychology, and the verbiage of the character. Awards Paola Barrientos won the 2012 Tato Award as supporting actress in daily fiction, and the 2012 Martín Fierro Award as secondary actress in daily fiction, for her work in the program. She received her Martín Fierro Award right after the one of the investigative journalist Jorge Lanata, who sarcastically thanked president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and other members of her cabinet for it (Lanata is a vocal critic of them, and headed several controversial investigations about them). Barrientos simply said that she also thanked the people named by Lanata. As her comment was misunderstood as a support to Lanata, she clarified that she did not agree with him.

The Chief Justice of Pakistan is the Chairman of JCP. On 20 April 2010, 18th Constitutional Amendment was passed in the Parliament of Pakistan. In pursuance of the 18th Amendments, a Judicial Commission was proposed to be created to recommend the appointment of Judges of the Superior Courts in Pakistan. Following is the collective text of the Article 175 (A) which was inserted in the constitution of Pakistan through this amendment. Article 175 A. Appointment of Judges to the Supreme Court, High Courts and the Federal Shariat Court: (1) There shall be a Judicial Commission of Pakistan, hereinafter in this Article referred to as the Commission, for appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court, High Courts and the Federal Shariat Court, as hereinafter provided. (2) For appointment of Judges of the Supreme Court, the Commission shall consist of--- (i) Chief Justice of Pakistan - Chairman; (ii) four most senior Judges of the Supreme Court as Members; (iii) a former Chief Justice or a former Judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan to be nominated by the Chief Justice of Pakistan, in consultation with the [four] member Judges, for a term of two years - Member; (iv) Federal Minister for Law and Justice as Member; (v) Attorney-General for Pakistan as Member; (vi) a Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court of Pakistan nominated by the Pakistan Bar Council for a term of two years as Member. (3) Notwithstanding anything contained in clause (1) or clause (2), the President shall appoint the most senior Judge of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice of Pakistan. (4) The Commission may make rules regulating its procedure.......(5 to 7) (8) The Commission by majority of its total membership shall nominate to the Parliamentary Committee one person, for each vacancy of a Judge in the Supreme Court, a High Court or the Federal Shariat Court, as the case may be. (9) The Parliamentary Committee, hereinafter in this Article referred to as the Committee, shall consist of the following eight members, namely: (i) four members from the Senate; and (ii) four members from the National Assembly. Provided that when the National Assembly is dissolved, the total member-ship of the parliamentary Committee shall consist of the members from the Senate only mentioned in paragraph (i) and the provisions of this Article shall, mutatis mutandis, apply. (10) Out of the eight members of the Committee, four shall be from the Treasury Benches, two from each House and four from the Opposition Benches, two from each House. The nomination of members from the Treasury Benches shall be made by the Leader of the House and from the Opposition Benches by the Leader of the Opposition. (11) Secretary, Senate shall act as the Secretary of the Committee. (12) The Committee on receipt of a nomination from the Commission may confirm the nominee by majority of its total membership within fourteen days, failing which the nomination shall be deemed to have been con-firmed: Provided that the Committee for reasons to be recorded, may not confirm the nomination by three-fourths majority of its total membership within the said period. Provided further that if a nomination is not confirmed by the Committee it shall forward its decision with reasons so recorded to the Commission through the Prime Minister. Provided further that if a nomination is not confirmed, the Com-mission shall send another nomination. (13) The Committee shall send the name of the nominee confirmed by it or deemed to have been confirmed to the Prime Minister who shall for-ward the same to the President for appointment. (14) No action or decision taken by the Commission or a Committee shall be invalid or called in question only on the ground of the existence of a vacancy therein or of the absence of any member from any meeting thereof. (15) The meetings of the Committee shall be held in camera and the record of its proceedings shall be maintained. (16) The provisions of Article 68 shall not apply to the proceedings of the Committee. (17) The Committee may make rules for regulating its procedure. Through 18th Amendment in 2010, Pakistan got two forums for appointment of judges to the superior judiciary: a Judicial Commission with representation from the judiciary, lawyers and the federal government, responsible for recommending names of perspective judges; and a parliamentary committee [PC] to approve or reject these names but with assigning reasons if some name is rejected. This mechanism had in fact curtailed the powers of the President and the political executive, which was also objectionable in deed, but the propaganda in the media was made that \\"CJP's powers have been cur-tailed\\" in the name of 'meaningful consultation' [the phrase devised and more emphasized by the CJP Sajjad Ali Shah, in fact] The 18th amendment also provided (vide Para 3 of Article 175A) that the president shall appoint the senior most judge of the Supreme Court to the office of the CJP thus formally recognising the principle of seniority and legitimate expectancy enunciated by the apex court in the Al- Jihad case and subsequently reiterated in some other cases.'Judges & Generals in Pakistan Vol-III' by Inam R Sehri [2013] PP 999-1001; GHP Surrey UK References Category:Pakistani law Category:Supreme Court of Pakistan ","title":"Judicial Commission of Pakistan"},{"id":"45311786","text":"Pseudojuloides kaleidos, the Kaleidos wrasse or blue-nose wrasse, is a species of saltwater fish.

He is the author of The Interrogator: An Education (2011), which describes his involvement in the interrogation of a man at the time believed to be one of the top members of al-Qa'ida.  Biography  Glenn Carle grew up in Brookline, a town part of greater Boston, in a house \\"where four generations of his family made their home\\". Carle received a B.A. in Government at Harvard and in 1985 an M.A. in European Studies and International Economics from Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), and completed further graduate work in Europe. He spent 20 years in clandestine field operations with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Carle retired as Deputy National Intelligence Officer for Transnational Threats from the National Intelligence Council.  The Interrogator  Carle is the author of The Interrogator: An Education (2011), a memoir which describes his involvement in the interrogation of a \\"high-value detainee\\" at a \\"black site\\" (off-the-books) prison. Carle tells the story of the brutal interrogation of a man who was believed to be a top al-Qaeda operative but later turned out to be innocent. Carle determined that the suspect was not who he was supposed to be, found the rendition \\"stupid, bad tradecraft\\" and the operation to be \\"a house of cards, like so much of the war on terrorism. Carle's superiors overruled him and sent the suspect to Hotel California, the CIA's most secret detention centre, to be tortured. The suspect at the center of Carle's story is supposed to be Haji Pacha Wazir, an Emirati citizen. He was freed in February 2010, eight years after his capture. In Carle's words, the CIA made him rewrite The Interrogator \\"literally a dozen times over\\" and its objections were some legitimate concerns \\"amply mixed with ludicrous pettifoggery and ass- covering\\", causing him to leave in the redacted bits, complete with black bars, and add the occasional withering explanatory footnote, like one that reads: \\"Apparently the CIA fears that the redacted passage would either humiliate the organization for incompetence or expose its officers to ridicule; unless the Agency considers obtuse incompetence a secret intelligence method.\\" Johns Hopkins Magazine has found The Interrogator to be \\"unusually candid in its portrayal of the CIA's internal workings—and the toll the agency's moral gray zones take on its operatives\\". Carle's book was well received internationally and he was interviewed at the Sydney Writers' Festival in 2012. Ali Soufan, a renowned FBI Special Agent who was involved in counter-terrorism cases, reviewed The Interrogator for The Wall Street Journal and remarked that it pulled back part of the curtain on the so-called enhanced-interrogation program of the CIA. Post-CIA career as national/global security expert Carle is regarded as a leading expert on al- Qaeda and assessed the threat the organization poses 10 years after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 on C-SPAN.\\"Assessment of Al Qaeda\\", C-SPAN, accessed 9 February 2015 Carle is a regular commentator for Al Jazeera and has appeared on Inside Story Americas. He was interviewed on The Listening Post to comment on the 'Zero Dark Thirty' controversy. In a 2011 interview with Democracy Now! Carle revealed how, in 2005, President George W. Bush's administration at least twice sought damaging personal information from the CIA on Juan Cole, an academic and prominent critic of the Iraq war. A CIA spokesman said in response to queries, \\"We've thoroughly researched our records, and any allegation that the C.I.A. provided private or derogatory information on Professor Cole to anyone is simply wrong.\\" In an interview with New Zealand's Sunday Star-Times, he talked about the curtailment of freedom of speech under the Espionage Act of 1917, designed for foreign spies, which he claimed was being employed to prosecute at least six American former spies. Carle has appeared on MSNBC in Hardball with Chris Matthews in a discussion titled \\"Does torture work?\\" In an interview with Anderson Cooper 360° he made the point that \\"you don't define yourself by the practices and objectives of the enemy\\" but figure out who are we and what do we need to be?\\" Carle has repeatedly stated that torture doesn't work, is morally wrong and is clearly illegal under both international and U.S. law. He makes the point that the U.S. convicted many Japanese soldiers \\"for the express crime — the torture — of waterboarding\\" that it has euphemistically called waterboarding. Carle also appeared on The Diane Rehm Show on NPR to comment on intelligence gains from Osama bin Laden's compound after U.S. Navy SEALs killed the al-Qaeda leader in Abbotabad, Pakistan. He has also been interviewed on Hardtalk on the BBC. Before the presidential election of 2008, Carle argued in an influential Washington Post article that Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee, had overstated the threat of \\"radical Islamic extremism.\\" Carle wrote that jihadists are \\"small, lethal, disjointed and miserable opponents\\" and that \\"We do not face a global jihadist 'movement' but a series of disparate ethnic and religious conflicts involving Muslim populations, each of which remains fundamentally regional in nature and almost all of which long predate the existence of al-Qaeda.\\" He went on to say, \\"Osama bin Laden and his disciples are small men and secondary threats whose shadows are made large by our fears.\\" Carle has spoken at many institutions, including the University of Ottawa, the Delta State University, Boston College, the University of Sydney, and the United States Naval Academy. Carle has been critical of President Donald Trump, particularly after Trump began to disparage American intelligence agencies' assessment of Russian influence over the 2016 presidential election. He told Newsweek, in an article dated December 21, 2017, that he believed that President Donald Trump was \\"actually working directly for the Russians.\\"  References  Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Living people Category:People of the Central Intelligence Agency Category:Paul H.

Since 2011, she has been leading the parliamentary capacity development portfolio at the Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI) in the MENA region, focusing on the legislative and oversight roles of Arab parliamentarians in advancing reforms in the Middle East Oil and Gas sector. Personal life Antelias Laury was born to Armenian parents Garabed and Mayram Haytayan on October 13, 1975, exactly six months after the start of the Lebanese Civil War. She was born and raised in Antelias, a town on the coast of the Metn District in the Mount Lebanon Governorate. Laury pursued her bachelor's degree of Arts in Communication Design from the Lebanese American University in Ras Beirut, an area earlier restricted to Christians. She later earned a master's degree in 'Middle East Politics' from the University of Exeter in Devon, United Kingdom. Laury later shifted her focus to the Oil and Gas Sector in Lebanon, as a means for national development and peace building. Career Life Laury Haytayan is the MENA Senior Officer at the Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI) formerly the Revenue Watch Institute, a framework of the Natural Resource Charter. She leads both regional parliamentary and media programs and was involved in the development of a MENA extractive industries knowledge hub. Prior to joining NRGI, Haytayan was the executive director of Arab Region Parliamentarians Against Corruption (ARPAC), a chapter within the Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption. She worked with parliamentarians from Arab parliament, developing strategies and action plans to strengthen the oversight and legislative capacities of parliamentarians to promote accountability and transparency. Previously, she was in charge of regional grass root projects focused on promoting the role of women in development and policy making in several GCC countries, specifically in Bahrain, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. She also worked as grant manager, advocacy specialist and trainer for several international NGOs, including International Research and Exchanges Board (IREX), Agricultural Cooperative Development International/Volunteers in Overseas Cooperative Assistance (ACDI/VOCA), and Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), focusing mainly on civil society democracy campaigns in Lebanon and Iraq. She was invited by the Carter Center for the Election monitoring of the Tunisian parliamentary elections in 2011, the first elections following the Tunisian Revolution and the ousting of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. Since 2004, Haytayan started working with different stakeholders such as youth, women, devastated communities and parliamentarians to build \\"pro-active\\" societies, and to promote a culture of accountability and transparency, and rule of law in public spheres and institutions. Laury received the Gold Distinction and Excellence Award by the Arab Women Council in 2014 for her role in promoting social responsibility. Haytayan was honored on International Women's Day in 2015 by the Green Party of Lebanon for her work in supporting the participation of women in politics.

According to the 3D seismic survey offshore Lebanon, there is great potential. However, the risks in Lebanon are very high, which puts [the country] in a weak position vis-a- vis the companies.

Laury Haytayan, cited as one of the leaders of the civil society talks about the importance of Beneficial Ownership in the oil and gas sector and especially in Lebanon. She is quoted saying: In many cases throughout the global oil and gas industry those companies bidding for — and sometimes winning — petroleum contracts have close ties to the government through connections that influence the award. These companies can mask the identity of their ownership: \\"They’re hiding behind companies and law firms, behind shell companies or even entities that do not exist\\" Arbid, Jeremy \\"Not just a pipe dream\\", Executive Magazine, 22 January 2015.

Albertina, Vienna, 27.5 x 19.6 cm Self- Portrait at the age of 13 is a silverpoint drawing by Albrecht Dürer, dated 1484 and now in the Albertina museum, Vienna. It is both the artist's first known, and one of the earliest extant, self-portraits in European art. It was completed some two years before Albrecht left his father's apprenticeship to study under Michael Wolgemut, who he quickly realised was a valuable mentor but not his equal in ability.Bieler (2017), p. 21 Throughout his life Dürer was resolutely self-confident and inclined to celebrate himself, a fact evident in both in his artistic output and writings.Hall (2014), p. 91 His three surviving self-portraits were all completed before he entered his 30s, and predate his mature period. As with the other self portraits, which are painted, this work can be interpreted as an expression of his awareness of and confidence in his developing artistic powers, a tone that is especially evident in his precocious facial expression. Dürer presents himself in half- length and in side view, in a pose closely modeled on a surviving portrait attributed to his father, also Albrecht, a goldsmith by profession. The artist's left arm is raised, while his index finger, haughty and Christ-like, points to an unidentified area outside the pictorial frame. He presents himself in a flattering light, with long hair, boyish and fresh-faced good looks, and (was then both fashionable and indicative of his skill as a draftsman) elegant and elongated fingers. Referring to his relatively unsophisticated youthful drawings, Dürer wrote in 1528 that even simple sketches could express \\"the spiritual essence of an artist's creative impulse\\", while a talented artist could express more in a simple line-drawing than a mediocre artist could in a year of painting.Chipps Smith; Sliver, p. 16 It is believed that the self-portrait was set as a task by Albrecht the Elder as a challenge for his son.Hall (2014), p. 92 It was signed at some unknown later date with the words \\"This I drew myself from a mirror in the year 1484, when I was still a child. Albrecht Dürer\\".Bieler (2017), p. 17 Although the self-portrait is commonly known by the \\"at the age of 13\\" title, it is known to have been completed only in 1484; given he was born in May 1471, and did not give any name to the work, he may equally likely have been 12 years old.Hall (2014), p. 90The same is true of his Self-Portrait at 28, which he similarly did not title. The autograph dates as the paintings as completed in 1500, leaving open the almost equal possibility he was 29 years old. Notes Bibliography * Bieler, Stacey.

It is managed and led by Teignbridge District Council in partnership with other south west of England local authorities and the Environment Agency. The South West Regional Coastal Programme is part of a nationwide network of regional coastal monitoring programmes. The focus of the ongoing programme is collecting data on waves, tides, LiDAR, Aerial Photography, topographic beach surveys, storm response and ecological mapping Data is published through its website, and is freely available for public use.http://www.n-somerset.gov.uk/Leisure/parks_and_open_spaces/Beaches-and- the-coast/Documents/sea%20defence%20deployment%20information%20%28pdf%29.pdf Location The PCO office is situated on the Campus of Plymouth University, located in the city centre of Plymouth, England. Creation The first phase of the programme was set up in 2006, with an initial grant of £7.2 million from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). The funding was split into two with £4.1 million used by Teignbridge to deliver, Bathymetric and Topographic, Hydrographic surveys and £3.1 million managed by the Environment Agency to deliver Aerial photography, LiDAR and Ecological mapping. Phase 2 of the programme commenced in 2011 with 100% DEFRA funding, and will run until 2016. Phase 2 of the Programme is solely managed by Teignbridge District Council. Assets The PCO has a network of wave buoys around the south west coastline collecting data on wave height, direction and sea temperature. In July 2014 the PCO wave buoys recorded the highest sea temperatures seen for 7 years around the south west coastline. In 2011 the PCO buoy network also detected a 0.5 - 0.8m tsunami along south west coast of England. The PCO has four tide gauges situated around the south west coast, collecting real time tidal and surge data. A notable addition to the tidal gauge network was the Port Isaac Step gauge, which was installed in 2010. The installation at Port Isaac filled a 'notable gap in measured tide data along the north Cornwall coastline' http://rid.eurocean.org/detail_pdf.jsp?load=315&ran;=0.9405646486455989 Research and Collaboration After the 2013/2014 winter storms Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) awarded a £50,000 emergency project grant to coastal researchers at the Plymouth University in conjunction with PCO and the Met Office.

This includes shots on goal, missed shots on goal, and blocked shot attempts towards the opposition's net minus the same shot attempts directed at your own team's net. History The Corsi number was named by Tim Barnes, a financial analyst from Chicago working under the pseudonym Vic Ferrari. He had heard former Buffalo Sabres general manager Darcy Regier talking about shot differential on the radio, and then proceeded to develop a formula to accurately display shot differential. Ferrari originally wanted to name it the Regier number, but he didn't think it sounded right. He then considered calling it the Ruff number after former Buffalo Sabres head coach Lindy Ruff but he didn't think that was appropriate either. Ferrari ended up searching Buffalo Sabres staff, found a picture of Jim Corsi, and chose his name because he liked Corsi's mustache. Formulae * Corsi For (CF) = Shot attempts for at even strength: Shots + Blocks + Misses * Corsi Against (CA) = Shot attempts against at even strength: Shots + Blocks + Misses * Corsi (C) = CF - CA * Corsi For % (CF%) = CF / (CF + CA) * Corsi For % Relative (CF% Rel) = CF% - CFOff% * Corsi Per 60 Minutes at Even Strength (C/60) = (CF - CA) * 60 / TOI * Relative Corsi per 60 Minutes at Even Strength (Crel/60) = CF/60 - CFoff/60 = On-Ice Corsi For / 60 Minutes - Off- Ice Corsi For / 60 Minutes Relevance Because shot attempts are often taken in the offensive zone, Corsi numbers provide an indication of the time a team spends in the offensive zone, versus time spent in their defensive zone. Positive Corsi numbers tells you that the team spends more time in the offensive zone than the defensive zone, while negative Corsi numbers tells you the team spends more time in the defensive zone than offensive zone. Possession is a good stat to take into account because the team with the higher possession numbers at the end of the game generally wins. Corsi can be broken down into four categories: Corsi Ahead, Corsi Even, Corsi Close, and Corsi behind. In order, the categories refer to what a team or player's Corsi number is when they are ahead in the game, when the game is tied, when the score of the game only differs by one goal no matter who is ahead, and when the score is behind, in that order. Each of these stats will tell a coach whom he should be putting out on the ice depending on the score of the game. Criticisms While Corsi may provide a more accurate evaluation of players' contributions to a winning effort than plus-minus (giving a plus to players who are on the ice when a goal is scored and a minus to players who are on the ice when a goal is scored on their own net), it does have its own criticisms. For example, a player is on the ice for 30 shots on net and 20 shots against. This player is a defensive defenseman, and in this situation he only helped create 5 shots on net but his mistakes led to 15 shots against. This tells us his real impact on the game is -10 Corsi, but on the game sheet at the end of the game his Corsi number will be +10. This is because he was playing with better players around him and that boosted his Corsi number. Essentially, a good player playing consistently with bad players will have a lower Corsi number, while a good player playing with great players will get a boost. For this reason, additional advanced metrics, for instance using raw Corsi values adjusted against frequent on-ice teammates', can provide a more accurate assessment of individual players' contributions.

The band are noted for their quirky mix of DIY garage rock, shambling post-punk, and delicate introspection. They are considered to be one of the last bands of the DIY era, and have been compared to The Fall, Swell Maps, and Captain Beefheart. History =1981–1986: Formation and Last Chance Saloon= After leaving Stoke-based group The Pits in 1980, Tim Shutt moved to London. In February 1981, he decided to rerecord two of The Pits' songs: \\"Hamburger Boy\\", and \\"Switch\\". Phil Bourne and Dave Robbins from The Colors Out of Time played guitar and bass for the session, Shutt's then-housemate Kevin Rodgers filled in on drums, and an old bandmate of Shutt's, Paul Johnston, came along to help out. This recording was to be the beginning of Happy Refugees. Shutt has since explained their choice of name: \\"I [liked] the idea of us all being refugees from something. 'Happy' was added to the band name. [Paul Johnston] was adamant that it should not have 'The' added. The name of the band was to be Happy Refugees.\\" The band was initially a four-piece, made up of Shutt, Johnston, and Rodgers, with a friend from college, Paul Lamb, playing bass. Their first formal release as a group was the double A-sided single Warehouse Sound / Enshrined in a Memory in 1982. It was released on their own imprint, Gymnasium Records, and distributed by Red Rhino, a member of the Cartel. This first single was met with acclaim, albeit underground. Nick Flynn and Paul Harvey joined later that year on keyboard and guitar, and the band began to write material for their first studio album, Last Chance Saloon, as well as playing in clubs around London. Last Chance Saloon was recorded in a single day in May 1983 to save money, and was released in early 1984. Although the band split up weeks after recording the album, Shutt and Johnston carried on performing under the Happy Refugees moniker until 1986. Rodgers and Flynn formed their own band with their friend Clive Williams, called The Hotel Complex, while Harvey moved to Newcastle to join Pauline Murray's band, and was later to join the reformed Penetration in 2001.Milner, Frank ed. The Stuckists Punk Victorian, p.74, National Museums Liverpool 2004. =2010–present: Rerelease and Beyond Moth and Rust= The Happy Refugees lineup that released Beyond Moth and Rust, photographed in 2011. From left: Paul Harvey, Paul Johnston, Tim Shutt, Nick Flynn, Kevin Rodgers, Clive Williams. In 2010, after a two and a half decade hiatus from music, Shutt received a phone call from Dan Selzer, who wanted to rerelease Last Chance Saloon on New York-based Acute Records. Return to Last Chance Saloon was released in 2011, and included the band's 1982 single, as well as outtakes and demos not included on the original LP. It was made available both on vinyl and as a downloadable package, and was well received. Happy Refugees reformed that same year, with Hotel Complex bassist Clive Williams replacing Lamb, who had died in 2007. The group visited New York to promote the record. While there, they recorded a live session on WFMU, as well as several other live performances, one as guests of American indie-rockers Crystal Stilts at The Knitting Factory, Brooklyn. The band described themselves as inspired by the experience, and returned to the UK to write and record the songs for a second album, released on Gymnasium Records, with Harvey, by then a leading stuckist, providing the cover art. This album, titled Beyond Moth and Rust, was made available on iTunes and Spotify on 22 December 2014, and was officially released in vinyl format on 23 February 2015. It includes several songs the band had written in the eighties, but never recorded, such as \\"What's Your Appeal\\", and \\"Ill Wind\\", as well as various newly penned tracks. Influence Crystal Stilts and Irish four-piece Girls Names have named the band as an influence. In 2012, NME featured Last Chance Saloon as one of 100 Great Albums You've Never Heard at the behest of Dylan Baldi of Cloud Nothings, and in 2014, \\"Hamburger Boy\\", a song from Last Chance Saloon, was named in The story of UK DIY: 131 experimental underground classics from 1977-1985 by FACT Magazine. Additionally, the cover of their first single Warehouse Sound / Enshrined in a Memory, featuring a photocopied picture of a bush, was shown in a 2012 exhibition of great punk graphics at the Hayward Gallery, London.

It is sometimes said that animals create their own \\"subjective social reality\\" from their perception of the input. In humans, for example, an optimistic or pessimistic bias might affect one's answer to the question \\"Is the glass half empty or half full?\\" To explore cognitive bias, one might train an animal to expect that a positive event follows one stimulus and that a negative event follows another stimulus. For example, on many trials, if the animal presses lever A after a 20 Hz tone it gets a highly desired food, but a press on lever B after a 10 Hz tone yields bland food. The animal is then offered both levers after an intermediate test stimulus, e.g. a 15 Hz tone. The hypothesis is that the animal's \\"mood\\" will bias the choice of levers after the test stimulus; if positive, it will tend to choose lever A, if negative it will tend to choose lever B. The hypothesis is tested by manipulating factors that might affect mood – for example, the type of housing the animal is kept in. Cognitive biases have been shown in a wide range of species including rats, dogs, rhesus macaques, sheep, chicks, starlings and honeybees. In rats In what has been described as a \\"landmark study\\", the first study of cognitive bias in animals was conducted with rats. This showed that laboratory rats in unpredictable environments had a more pessimistic attitude than rats in predictable environments. One study on rats investigated whether changes in light intensity – a short-term manipulation of emotional state – has an effect on cognitive bias. Light intensity was chosen as a treatment because this specifically relates to anxiety-induction. Rats were trained to discriminate between two different locations, in either high ('H') or low ('L') light levels. One location was rewarded with palatable food and the other with aversive food. Rats switched from high to low light levels (putatively the least negative emotional manipulation) ran faster to all three ambiguous locations than rats switched from low to high light levels (putatively the most negative manipulation). Another study investigated whether chronic social defeat makes rats more pessimistic. To induce chronic psychosocial stress, rats were subjected to daily social defeat in a resident–intruder paradigm for three weeks. This chronic psychosocial stress makes rats more pessimistic. Using the cognitive bias approach, it has been found that rats which are subjected to either handling or playful, experimenter-administered manual stimulation (tickling) showed different responses to the intermediate stimulus: rats exposed to tickling were more optimistic. The authors stated that they had demonstrated \\"...for the first time a link between the directly measured positive affective state and decision making under uncertainty in an animal model\\". In pet dogs Up to five million pet dogs in the UK, approximately 50% of the population, may perform undesirable separation-related behaviour when left home alone. Dogs were trained to move from a start position to a food bowl. When the bowl was on one side of the room ('positive' location, P) it contained a small quantity of food, and when on the opposite side ('negative' location, N) it was empty. In test trials, the bowl (empty) was placed at one of three ambiguous locations between P and N (near-positive (NP), middle (M), or near-negative (NN). Three test trials were presented at each location. The researchers measured how quickly the dogs moved to the ambiguous locations, fast indicating anticipation of food (an 'optimistic' judgement) or more slowly (a 'pessimistic' judgement). These cognitive bias tests show that dogs which exhibit high levels of separation-related behaviour in a separation test also have a more negative underlying mood. In pigs Domestic pigs do not appear to develop a cognitive bias when kept in different stocking densities. Farmed pigs trained to expect food inside a bowl in one location and not in another, and then tested to show their responses to ambiguous spatial locations. Forty growing pigs were housed in groups of 10 at different density for 8 weeks prior to the start of the test. Tests on three occasions for each pig did not reveal any difference in cognitive bias according to the pig's history of stocking density. One study shows that restriction of collared peccaries (Pecari tajacu) in metabolism pens affects their emotional state and increases faecal glucocorticoid (a stress hormone) metabolite concentrations. The researchers noted that these effects were mitigated by environmental enrichment. In honeybees Honeybees become pessimistic after being shaken Honeybees (Apis mellifera carnica) were trained to extend their proboscis to a two-component odour mixture (CS+) predicting a reward (e.g., 1.00 or 2.00 M sucrose) and to withhold their proboscis from another mixture (CS−) predicting either punishment or a less valuable reward (e.g., 0.01 M quinine solution or 0.3 M sucrose). Immediately after training, half of the honeybees were subjected to vigorous shaking for 60 s to simulate the state produced by a predatory attack on a concealed colony. This shaking reduced levels of octopamine, dopamine, and serotonin in the hemolymph of a separate group of honeybees at a time point corresponding to when the cognitive bias tests were performed. In honeybees, octopamine is the local neurotransmitter that functions during reward learning, whereas dopamine mediates the ability to learn to associate odours with quinine punishment. If flies are fed serotonin, they are more aggressive; flies depleted of serotonin still exhibit aggression, but they do so much less frequently. Within 5 minutes of the shaking, all the trained bees began a sequence of unreinforced test trials with five odour stimuli presented in a random order for each bee: the CS+, the CS−, and three novel odours composed of ratios intermediate between the two learned mixtures. Shaken honeybees were more likely to withhold their mouthparts from the CS− and from the most similar novel odour. Therefore, agitated honeybees display an increased expectation of bad outcomes similar to a vertebrate-like emotional state. The researchers of the study stated that, \\"Although our results do not allow us to make any claims about the presence of negative subjective feelings in honeybees, they call into question how we identify emotions in any nonhuman animal. It is logically inconsistent to claim that the presence of pessimistic cognitive biases should be taken as confirmation that dogs or rats are anxious but to deny the same conclusion in the case of honeybees.\\" References Category:Animal cognition Category:Cognitive biases Category:Animal welfare Category:Behavioural sciences Category:Emotion Category:Ethology Category:Zoology ","title":"Cognitive bias in animals"},{"id":"45312413","text":"Tapinoma schultzei is a species of ant in the genus Tapinoma.

With a possible construction date as early as 1804, was Skowhegan's first site for town meetings and elections, also seeing use as a school and church. It was used primarily as a school between 1849 and 1921, and has been used since then by community groups. The modest Greek Revival building is the least-altered of Skowhegan's surviving 19th- century district schools, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The Dudley's Corner School is set on a grassy triangle of land bounded by Rosies Court (formerly part of Parkman Road prior to a bridge closure), Dudley Corner Road, and United States Route 2, about east of the Skowhegan village center. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, clapboard siding, and a granite slab foundation. A single brick chimney rises from the north end of the building. The main entrance is off-center on the south side, with a transom window overhead that has elliptical muntins. There are two sash windows on each of the other three sides of the building. The doorway leads into a small vestibule area, which then opens into a single large chamber. Three walls have vertical wainscoting with plaster on lath above, while the fourth wall is completely finished in tapered wooden boards. The ceiling is plastered. The room shows evidence of repeated alteration. The first school building at this site was constructed in 1804. It is unclear whether the present building is a replacement or a rehabilitation of that first building, since records pertaining work performed in 1835 are unclear. According to a local history, the Dudley's Corner School was the site at which most town meetings and elections were held between 1828 and 1848, and also housed meetings of the First Christian Church before it moved into the village. Between 1849 and 1921 the building served the community as a school. It was used as a function space in the 1930s and 1940s by the local chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and more recently by local Boy Scout organizations. It continues to be owned by the town.

Life =Birth= Martin Gosselin was born at Walfield, near Hertford, on 2 November. 1847. He was grandson of Admiral Thomas Le Marchant Gosselin and eldest son of Martin Hadsley Gosselin of Ware Priory and Blakesware, Hertfordshire, by his wife Frances Orris, eldest daughter of Admiral Sir John Marshall of Gillingham House, Kent. =Career= Educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, he entered the diplomatic service in 1868, and after working in the Foreign Office was appointed attaché at Lisbon in 1869. He was transferred to Berlin in 1872, where he remained till promoted to be second secretary at Saint Petersburg in 1874. During the Congress of Berlin in 1878 he was attached to the special mission of the British plenipotentiaries, Lord Beaconsfield and Lord Salisbury. He was transferred from Saint Petersburg to Rome in 1879, returned to Saint Petersburg in the following year, and to Berlin in 1882. In 1885 he was promoted to be secretary of legation, and was appointed to Brussels, where he served till 1892, taking charge of the legation at intervals during the absence of the minister, and being employed on occasions on special service. In November 1887 he was appointed secretary to the Duke of Norfolk's special mission to Pope Leo XIII on the occasion of the pontiff's jubilee. In 1889 and 1890 he and Alfred Bateman of the Board of Trade served as joint British delegates in the conferences held at Brussels to arrange for the mutual publication of customs tariffs, and in July of the latter year he signed the convention for the establishment of the International Union for the Publication of Customs Tariffs. He was also employed as one of the secretaries to the international conference for the suppression of the African slave trade, which sat at Brussels in 1889 and the following year and resulted in the General Act of 2 July 1890. In recognition of his services he was in 1890 made a companion of Order of the Bath (CB). Later in that year he was one of the British delegates at the conference held by representatives of Great Britain, Germany, and Italy to discuss and fix the duties to be imposed on imports in the conventional basin of the Congo, and he signed the agreement which was arrived at in December 1890. In April 1892 he was promoted to be secretary of embassy at Madrid, was transferred to Berlin in the following year, and to Paris in 1896, receiving at the latter post the titular rank of minister plenipotentiary. In 1897 he was selected to discuss with French commissioners the question of coolie emigration from British India to Réunion, and in that and the following year he served as one of the British members of the Anglo-French commission for the delimitation of the possessions and spheres of influence of the two countries to the east and west of the Niger river. The arrangement arrived at by the commission was embodied in a convention signed at Paris on 14 June 1898, and provided a solution of questions which had gravely threatened the good relations between the two countries. At the close of these negotiations he was created Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG). From July 1898 to August 1902 he held the home appointment of Assistant Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. That month he was appointed British envoy to the Court at Lisbon. He was received by King Edward VII at Balmoral Castle in early October, before his departure for Portugal. He held this post till his death in Lisbon on 26 February 1905 from the delayed effects of a motor-car accident. The relations of Great Britain with Portugal during Gosselin's residence were cordial but uneventful. Upon the state visit to the United Kingdom of the King and Queen of Portugal, Gosselin was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) by King Edward VII. Before his unexpected death he was a likely candidate to be made the next British ambassador in the diplomatically important imperial city of Vienna. Family Gosselin converted to Catholicism in 1878. He married in 1880 Katherine Frances Gerard (1856–1924), daughter of Robert Tolver Gerard, 1st Baron Gerard of Bryn, and left one son, Alwyn Bertram Robert Raphael Gosselin, a captain in the Grenadier Guards killed in 1915, and three daughters.

The fish may also found in Australia and Palau islands. Biology and habitat Ophisternon bengalense has an almost unknown biology, it is thought likely to be a protogynous hermaphrodite which lays eggs in a tunnel excavated into the soft substrate. The males excavate and guard the nesting burrow. The adults may be found in both fresh and brackish waters along rivers and in swamps, frequently close to the river mouth. They are normally recorded among thick vegetation in muddy, still water bodies, such as lagoons, swamps, canals and rice fields.

On 15 August 1945 he flew as fighter escort with one of the last Allied bombing raids on Tokyo Bay, subsequently participating in the last dogfight of the war, for which he was honoured. Early life Victor Lowden was born in Bangkok where his father was working as an accountant. He was educated at Strathallan School in Scotland and St John's College, Cambridge. Lowden graduated with a BA (Hons) in economics, which had been accelerated over two years, so that he could join the Fleet Air Arm. His younger brother was Gordon Lowden. Naval career Lowden joined the Fleet Air Arm in July 1942 and completed his basic flying training at RAF Sealand and RCAF Station Kingston in Canada. Whilst training at RNAS Henstridge Lowden came to the attention of Commander R Mike Crosley who described him as a 'natural'. He started flying the Supermarine Seafire in August 1943 and joined 899 Naval Air Squadron in Northern Ireland before embarking on HMS Khedive (D62). Lowden's first sortie took place in June 1944 near Peterhead, Scotland as part of the Air Defence of Great Britain. He then flew sorties over France during Operation Dragoon and over the Aegean Sea in September 1944. In April 1945, 899 Naval Air Squadron arrived in Australia aboard HMS Chaser (D32). The squadron was dismantled and pilots and planes transferred to the fleet carrier HMS Indefatigable (R10). In May 1945 he officially joined 887 Naval Air Squadron as part of the British Pacific Fleet in Task Force 37 off the Sakishima Islands, Japan. As part of Task Force 38 from July 1945, he was engaged in combat air patrols off Shikoku and Honshu. Ramrod operations continued over the next few weeks, with attacks on shipping and shore installations near Sendai. =Raid on Tokyo Bay= On 15 August 1945, the British launched an attack from HMS Indefatigable on Kisarazu Air Field in Tokyo Bay. Eight Supermarine Seafires were tasked with escorting six Grumman TBF Avengers to the target. Sub-lieutenant Fred Hockley was the lead fighter of five Seafires which provided close cover for the Avengers, whilst Lowden was lead fighter of three Seafires providing top cover. Due to bad weather the formation changed target to a chemical factory at Odaki Bay, south of Tokyo. En route to the chemical factory, the formation was attacked from behind by a dozen Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero naval fighter aircraft. Hockley's radio failed and his Seafire hit instantly; taking to his parachute he was captured by the Japanese and executed. The remaining Seafire's entered the battle, which they won convincingly. The top cover Seafire's, led by Lowden, downed six Zero's. Lowden was credited with two destroyed, one shared and two damaged. Lowden's wingman, 'Taffy' Williams, destroyed one zero and shared another with him. The number three, 'Spud' Murphy, downed another two Zero's. At the same time, the close cover Seafire's, were also engaged in battle. Hockley's wingman Ted Garvin, damaged one Zero and Don Duncan a further two. Randy Kay shot one down, probably another and damaged a third Zero. Meanwhile, four Zero's managed to attack the six Avenger bombers. One of the bombers was very badly damaged but remained in formation. Another Avenger claimed to have downed a Zero from their gun turret. All six bombers made it to the chemical factory and dropped their bombs. Overall, the Seafire's claimed seven destroyed, three probably destroyed and four damaged Zero's. The Fleet Air Arm lost one Seafire and one Avenger. The damaged Avenger had deliberately ditched next to a destroyer on the return journey. Lowden's plane was the last to return to HMS Indefatigable. Later that day, Emperor Hirohito, announced via a pre-recorded radio address that Japanese forces had surrendered to the Allies. Following the official surrender on 2 September 1945 in Tokyo Bay, HMS Indefatigable returned to Sydney. On 11 September 1945, Lowden was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions over Tokyo Bay. Businessman After the war, Lowden returned to Scotland and joined the graduate programme at Low and Bonar, the Dundee based textile and electronics group. He became chief executive of the company's textile division with responsibility for all their textile units worldwide. Lowden was also a former chairman of the Dundee Jute and Linen Merchants' Association.

Pullum, \\"Comprise yourself\\", Lingua Franca, The Chronicle of Higher Education, 11 February 2015. Retrieved 13 February 2015. The distinction between the verb comprise (of course including preterite and past participle \\"comprised\\") and adjective comprised is perhaps most easily understood via compose(d): > Treatments of this topic nearly always mistakenly speak of is composed of > and is comprised of as passives. They aren't. Compose in its > musical/literary sense does have a passive (The Moonlight Sonata was > composed by Beethoven), but the part/whole sense doesn't. Nobody says *Brass > is composed by copper and zinc. Instead we get Brass is composed of copper > and zinc – and there is no understood by-phrase. Specifically, comprised within \\"comprised of\\" is a participial adjective.For the distinction between participial adjectives (e.g. uninvolved, also called adjectival participles) and past participles (e.g. enjoyed), see Rodney Huddleston, \\"The Verb\\", chap. 3 of Huddleston and Pullum, The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002; ), pp. 78–79; and \\"Participial adjectives\\", The Internet Grammar of English, University College London. See also the discussion of the adjectival passive in Gregory Ward, Betty Birner and Rodney Huddleston, \\"Information packaging\\", chap. 16 of The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language, pp. 1436–1440. For a more detailed and technical treatment, see Andrew McIntyre, \\"Adjectival passives and adjectival participles in English\\", in Artemis Alexiadou and Florian Schäfer, eds., Non-Canonical Passives (Amsterdam: Benjamins, 2013; ); McIntyre's paper is also freely downloadable here (Lingbuzz). The notion of participial adjective is not new; it can be found in for example Simon Kerl, A Common-School Grammar of the English Language (New York, 1866); here at HathiTrust. English has a number of adjectives that take as their complements preposition phrases headed by of. Common examples include afraid (\\"He's afraid of spiders\\"), aware (\\"They were aware of the dangers\\"), and convinced (\\"They became convinced of their strength\\").A non-exhaustive list of fifty or so such adjectives appears in Pullum and Huddleston, \\"Adjectives and adverbs\\", chap. 6 of Huddleston and Pullum, The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language, p. 544. In the process of conversion from verb to adjective, complementation may change. The verb comprise does not license a preposition phrase headed by of: its meaning aside, *\\"The book comprises of a hundred pages\\" is ungrammatical.By linguistics convention, an asterisk in front of a putative sentence or phrase denotes its ungrammaticality to native speakers of the language. However, the adjective comprised requires it: both *\\"The book is comprised a hundred pages\\" and *\\"The book is comprised\\" are ungrammatical. Grammatically, this is patterned on the conversion of verb compose to adjective composed (although semantically, matters are more complex). However, the sentence \\"the book comprises a hundred pages\\" is neither ungrammatical nor tautological. = Malaysian English = In Malaysian English, not only the adjective comprised but also the verb comprise can take a preposition phrase headed by of, as in: \\"According to our analysis, the voters comprise of 297 Malays, 469 Chinese, 39 Indians and four from other races\\".Tan Siew Imm (2011), \\"Structural nativisation in Malaysian English: Prepositional verb idiosyncrasies\\", Southeast Asian Review of English 50(1), pp. 133–151.  Semantics  The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) shows that the verb comprise has been used with a range of meanings. In its earliest known uses (from 1423), it seems to mean \\"To lay hold on, take, catch, seize\\", a sense now obsolete. The word comes from French ' (which itself comes from Latin), but while the OED does not call obsolete every comprehension-related sense of comprise, its newest examples are from the 1850s. The OED presents \\"Of things material: To contain, as parts making up the whole, to consist of (the parts specified)\\" as the fourth sense, first encountered in 1481. (However, it notes that \\"Many of the early passages in which this word occurs are so vague that it is difficult to gather the exact sense.\\") In the English of the 20th and 21st centuries, the part/whole meanings have been overwhelmingly important. Two are exemplified in: # \\"The committee comprises three judges.\\" # %\\"Three judges comprise the committee\\".By linguistics convention, a superscripted percentage mark in front of a putative sentence or phrase denotes its grammaticality to some but not all native speakers of the language. The former is not disputed. The latter is less common, and is disputed. It may be the result of a centuries-old malapropism for compose, a malapropism that caught on. Malapropism or no, it is now well established. The OED gives use 8.b of comprise as \\"To constitute, make up, compose\\", and dates this back to 1794; and it has been used by respected writers (for example, Charles DickensCharles Dickens, Hard Times, chap. 6; here at Project Gutenberg. Retrieved 13 February 2015. \\"These observations comprise the whole of the case.\\"). One may say \\"The committee is composed of three judges\\", and also \\"Three judges compose the committee\\". Although the former is not a passive clause (as explained in \\"Syntax\\", above), it behaves like one semantically. However, with the meaning of comprise that is the commonest (and is not disputed), the parallel pair is not possible for comprise(d). Instead, it is only possible for the pair %\\"The committee is comprised of three judges\\", and %\\"Three judges comprise the committee\\", both disputed.

The episode was written by Ned Martel, directed by co-executive producer Michael Hitchcock, and first aired on February 27, 2015 on Fox in the United States. The episode takes place as New Directions are hired by a young boy to perform at his bar mitzvah party, but he turns out to cause all sorts of problems. Meanwhile, Mason McCarthy is developing feelings for Jane Hayward but runs into issues with his sister Madison McCarthy, and Roderick helps Spencer Porter to begin a new relationship. Plot Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) runs a physical education class which includes Spencer Porter (Marshall Williams) and Roderick (Noah Guthrie) where she challenges Roderick to perform a vertical rope climb, which he fails. Roderick asks Spencer for help with his physical fitness which Spencer originally declines, but Spencer then discovers that Roderick is friends with new student Alistair (Finneas O'Connell) on whom he has a crush, so to impress Alistair, Spencer agrees to train Roderick. Sue asks Superintendent Bob Harris (Christopher Cousins) for a letter of recommendation for a Principal of the Year Award nomination, so he asks Sue to help his nephew Myron Muskovitz (J.J. Totah) prepare for his upcoming bar mitzvah party where he wants to perform. Myron shows his planned song and dance to New Directions and is shown to be very talented, but when his backup dancers are mildly criticized, he becomes very high-strung and demanding, and fires all of them on the spot. Myron tells Sue that he wants to use the auditorium for his party and have New Directions perform there, and Sue immediately agrees as she does not want to disappoint Superintendent Harris. Mason McCarthy (Billy Lewis Jr.) flirts with Jane Hayward (Samantha Marie Ware) but his advances are immediately cut off by his sister Madison McCarthy (Laura Dreyfuss). Mason confesses to Roderick and Spencer that Madison has always acted like a mother to him, and he needs Madison out of the way so he can pursue Jane. Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) and Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) discuss song choices for the party as Will challenges Rachel to get to know her New Directions members better. Coach Sheldon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones), Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), Rachel, and Will meet with Sue who is having problems answering to every whim of Myron, as Sue tells them that they are being forced to be the new backup dancers for Myron, while Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin) is not happy having to perform for this spoiled child. Spencer attempts to train Roderick but his methods are very aggressive and Roderick leaves. Mason convinces Jane to sing with him at the party, but when he tells Madison, she overreacts and embarrasses him. Later, Roderick and Spencer have an argument in the glee club room. At the party, Mason sings a song which makes Madison realize that he is more mature than she realized, and she agrees to let him have the space he wants to pursue Jane. Myron gets trapped inside of a pod that has been lifted off the stage, and Spencer uses positive encouragement to Roderick to get him to successfully climb a rope and release the pod. As Will trains Rachel, Sheldon, and Sue for their song, Sue loses her temper with Will and they engage in a brief physical fight. Alistair meets Spencer and apologizes for ignoring Spencer at first, but when Alistair states that Roderick has brought them together, it leads to them kissing, as Spencer asks Alistair to join New Directions. After a successful bar mitzvah party is over, Sue tells Will and Rachel that Myron has been advanced into high school thanks to Superintendent Harris, and Myron is now joining New Directions as he quickly becomes friends with Kitty by bribing her. Sue swears to herself to do whatever it takes to destroy Will, Rachel and the rest of New Directions. Production Two new recurring characters are introduced for the final five episodes of the series: J. J. Totah as Myron Muskovitz, a spoiled but very talented tween who is advanced into high school to join New Directions, and Finneas O'Connell as Alistair, a new student at McKinley High who becomes the love interest of Spencer and also joins New Directions. Returning recurring characters that appear in the episode include Becca Tobin as Kitty Wilde, Christopher Cousins as Superintendent Bob Harris, Noah Guthrie as Roderick, Samantha Marie Ware as Jane Hayward, Marshall Williams as Spencer Porter, Billy Lewis Jr. as Mason McCarthy, and Laura Dreyfuss as Madison McCarthy. The episode features six musical cover versions. \\"Lose My Breath\\" by Destiny's Child is sung by Totah. \\"Friday I'm in Love\\" by The Cure is sung by Williams. \\"I Want to Break Free\\" by Queen is sung by Lewis Jr. \\"Uptown Funk\\" by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars is sung by Guthrie, Ware, and Williams. \\"Break Free\\" by Ariana Grande featuring Zedd is sung by Jones, Lynch, Michele, Morrison, Overstreet, Totah, and backup singers. \\"Cool Kids\\" by Echosmith is sung by Dreyfuss, Guthrie, Lewis Jr., O'Connell, Tobin, Totah, Ware, and Williams.

Reception =Ratings= The episode was watched by 1.69 million viewers and received a 0.6 rating/2 share in the adult 18-49 demographic. =Critical response= Lauren Hoffman from Vulture stated in her review that she \\"DID like a lot of the things about the episode.

The dam, located just north of downtown Ellsworth, impounds the river to create Leonard Lake, named for project's engineer, James Leonard. The powerhouse is a Renaissance Revival building located at the western end of the dam. The power plant, built in 1907, was one of the first peaking power plants built in the state, and the hollow concrete dam is one of the highest Ambursen-type buttress dams ever built. The facility was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Ellsworth Dam is located between two bluffs which flank Maine's Union River, and rise to a height of more than . The dam consists of a series of buttresses, spaced about apart, which provide support for two large slabs of steel-reinforced concrete that span the river between the bluffs. The dam is in height, with a spillway long. The buttresses, set on a granite bedrock ledge, are three feet thick. The power station is located at the base of the dam on the west bank of the river. It is a 1-1/2 story structure built out of concrete blocks, with a red tile gabled roof. The Renaissance Revival structure has round-arch windows which are connected by a stone belt course, and there are Palladian windows in the gable ends. An addition on the building's rear was built with similar styling. The power station was built in 1907 by the Bar Harbor and Union River Power Company, to designs by its engineer, James Leonard. The company was merged in 1925 into the Bangor Hydro- Electric Company, now part of Emera. The plant was acquired by Black Bear Hydro in 2009, and sold to Brookfield Partners in 2014. The dam is in the process of being relicensed; its most recent permit was due to expire in 2017, however, public concern about fish passage and water quality, caused the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to delay issuing a new permit. The new expiration date is April 2020. In its current configuration, the plant produces about 30,000 megawatt-hours of electricity annually. (The dam is no longer hollow. During the 1990s. the FERC required installation of post- tensioned anchors deep into ledge and the filling of the hollow dam with concrete, in order to increase dam safety.)

History  The museum developed from the collection of Nahariya resident Israel Shiloni, who assembled historical material from friends and acquaintances to commemorate the German-speaking immigrants to Palestine and yekke culture. From 1968, his collection was on view at the municipality of Nahariya.http://www.omuseums.org.il/eng/mmty_about/About_the_Museumhttp://www.irgun- jeckes.org/?CategoryID=253&ArticleID;=3461 In 1991, the collection moved to the Tefen Industrial Park, east of Nahariya. After the museum and the Association of Israelis of Central European Origin (Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia and Switzerland) signed a contract of cooperation, the museum reopened in 2005.  Exhibition  = History of German-Speaking Jewry = The exhibition of the museum is spaced on 400 square meters in two floors. It focuses on the history of the German-speaking Jews of Central Europe till the Second World War and on their contribution to development, economy and culture of Israel. Although the topic is always present, the museum decided not to be a Holocaust museum. The museum artifacts are displayed according to topic and include interactive presentations incorporating texts, visual aids, authentic photographs and film. Upon request one can view documentary films produced by the Open Museum itself about the history of German-speaking immigrants to Israel. = Hermann Struck Exhibition = In the exhibition rooms works of the painter and etcher Hermann Struck (1876–1944) are shown. The exhibition focuses on Struck's artistic activities during his years in Haifa. Beyond that it shows materials from the personal bequest of the artist. = Historic pioneer cabin = A speciality of the museum is an original cabin from the early days of Nahariya, relocated to the museum. It was built in 1936 and is furnished as it was in the olden days, with a bed, a commode, old books and a simple shower device.http://www.omuseums.org.il/eng/mmty_shed/The_Shack_from_Nahariya Hugo- Zwi Schatzman (1900–1976) and his wife Lea-Gertrud, née Wallach (1906–1983) immigrated to Palestine from Germany in the year 1934. In preparation for their emigration they joined the league Blau-Weiß (Blue-White) in the Zionist youth movement, which followed the Zionist program of Hakhshara, where Hugo- Zvi learned to be a carpenter and Lea-Gertrud to be a barber and nursemaid. After their arrival in Palestine their group was sent to the kibbutz Ein Harod. In 1935 the couple moved to Nahariya and bought a parcel of land there at the corner of Weizman and Hanita street, where they built two settler shacks. In the bigger one of the two shacks they lived and used the smaller one as a storage. With the years the usage of the shacks adapted to the changing needs of the owners. In 1946 the Schatzmans sold the parcel to the Pisker family, which built a stone house at the side of the shacks. In the year 2010 the family sold the parcel. When a new apartment building was supposed to be built there, older Nahariyans (especially the glass factory owner Andreas Meyer) organised the preservation of the bigger shack as a historical testimony of the settler years. The Israeli society for the preservation of historical legacy took over the project and transferred the shack to the museum in Tefen. =\\"Now It Can Be Told\\"= The \\"Now It Can Be Told\\" exhibit is based on family stories about \\"changes of identity, false papers, secrets behind objects, unconventional migration, flight and professional retraining,\\" according to the museum’s curator, Ruth Ofek.New exhibition in Israel reveals the secrets of the yekkes, Haaretz  Library  The museum library contains more than 5000 books, mostly in German, which convey a broad overview of the contribution of German Jews in the fields of prose, poetry, philosophy, science and politics, as well as of scientific literature dealing with Central Europe's Jewry.

It is based on Ram, the legendary Indian king regarded as an incarnation of Vishnu. The title was revealed by the author at the Jaipur Literature Festival. The story begins with King Dashrath of Ayodhya being defeated in a war by Lankan trader Raavan, and the birth of his son Ram. It follows through Ram's childhood and tutelage, along with the politics surrounding his ascension to the throne, and ultimately his 14-year exile, accompanied by wife Sita and brother Lakshman. Plot synopsis King Dashrath of Ayodhya, Emperor of the Sapta Sindhu region in India, objects demands made by Kubera,trader and ruler of Lanka. He declares war but is defeated by Kubera's general Raavan, at Karachapa. Dashrath barely escapes with his life thanks to Kaikeyi, his second queen. At the same time in Ayodhya, Dashrath's first queen Kaushalya gives birth to their son, Ram. Following the defeat, Ravan monopolizes the entire trade system in India, causing economic crisis. Dashrath blames Ram as the reason for his defeat, and treats him apathetically. Ram and his half-brothers, Bharat (son of Kaikeyi), Lakshman and Shatrughan (twin sons of Dashrath's third wife Sumitra), are sent to live at the hermitage of sage Vashistha. Under his tutelage, Ram becomes a skilled warrior, and gains knowledge about India's predicament. After training, Ram is given the job of maintaining law and police in Ayodhya, in which he considerably excels. One day Roshni, daughter of the wealthy trader Manthara and sister-like to the four brothers, is gang raped and murdered. The culprits are all executed except one, Dhenuka, who is underage. A strict follower of the law, Ram is forced to imprison the boy although others request him for Dhenuka's execution. Manthara bribes Kaikeyi into influencing Bharat, who secretly murders Dhenuka, much to Ram's chagrin. In the meantime Dashrath's attitude towards Ram changes and he names Ram as the crown prince. Shortly afterwards, Ram and Lakshman help sage Vishwamitra—head of the Malayaputra tribe who serve the next Vishnu—to stop the Asura attacks on his hermitage. Ram convinces the Asuras to go to Pariha, the land of Lord Rudra, the previous Mahadev. Next they travel to the remote kingdom of Mithila, where Ram meets princess Sita, the adopted daughter of King Janak. Like Ram, Sita also strongly believes in following laws, thus earning Ram's respect and love. During a Swayamvar for Sita, Ravan and his brother Kumbhakaran arrive, but storm out when Viswamitra announces Ram's name as the first suitor. Ram wins the Swayamvar and marries Sita, while Lakshman marries Janak's biological daughter, Urmila. The next day, Raavan besieges Mithila with 10,000 soldiers, and Ram is forced to use the biological weapon Asurastra by Viswamitra, even though its usage is forbidden and not authorized by the Vayuputras, Lord Rudra's tribe. The Lankan army is defeated and Raavan escapes on his helicopter, Pushpak Viman. Ram returns to Ayodhya and decides to take a 14-year exile as punishment for breaking Rudra's rule about the weapon. A begrudged Manthara asks Kaikeyi to substantiate the matter by using two boons given to her by Dashrath for saving his life. Thus Ram undertakes the exile with Sita and Lakshman. After Dashrath's death, Bharat declares Ram as King of Ayodhya and decides to rule the kingdom as a regent. Sita makes a secret deal with the vulture-like Naga Jatayu and his men, to protect Ram and supply the trio with the anti-ageing drink, Somras. Thirteen years pass and one day, Ram's camp is approached by Raavan's siblings, Vibhishan and Shurpanakha, who seek refuge from their tyrannical brother. Ram is skeptical but accepts them as guests. One day, Shurpanakha attempts to drown Sita, but the latter overpowers her and in the ensuing scuffle, Lakshman instinctively cuts Shurpanakha's nose. Ram and his group flee from there fearing Raavan's retribution. One day, Ram and Lakshman return home from hunting and are shocked to find Jatayu and his men slain. Before dying Jatayu tells Ram that Ravan has kidnapped Sita. Ram looks up to see the Pushpak Viman flying away and is filled with rage. Development From 2010 to 2013, author Amish Tripathi released the three books in his fictional Shiva trilogy—The Immortals of Meluha, The Secret of the Nagas and The Oath of the Vayuputras—inspired by the Hindu God Shiva. The releases became a critical and commercial success, with reviewers crediting Tripathi for his innovative marketing strategy in promotion of the books, which included video trailers associated with high- profile film releases, retail chain distributions as well as a music album inspired by the series, called Vayuputras. As of June 2015, 2.5 million copies of the Shiva Trilogy have been sold with gross retail sales of over , making it the fastest selling book series in the history of Indian publishing. Tripathi's publisher Westland Press paid him advance amount of for the next series that he would write. Gautam Padmanabhan, CEO of Westland clarified that the advance included the book, audio and e-publishing rights for series. The deal was for the South-Asian region and was the largest advance ever paid to an Indian author. Anuj Bahri, who was the first publisher for The Immortals of Meluha, said that the deal could go up to US$4 million once they acquired the film, foreign and translation rights for the books. In January 2015, Tripathi revealed at the Jaipur Literature Festival that his next series would be based on Rama, the legendary Indian king regarded as an incarnation of Vishnu. He explained that at the 2013 version of the festival, a reader had asked him why people use the moniker \\"Lord\\" while naming Rama, which led to Tripathi thinking about developing a series. The author wrote about the incident in an article in the Hindustan Times also. He became curious as to how the battle between Rama and Ravana, explained in the Ramayana, unfolded and analyzed on Rama's treatment of his wife Sita. \\"The question [about the Lord moniker] deeply upset me... I agree how he treated Sita was unfair, but that was one aspect of his personality,\\" added Tripathi. He also wanted to highlight on the negative impression of Rama, and the term \\"Maryada Purush\\" associated with the king. \\"People erroneously translate this as 'the perfect man' when it actually means 'the perfect follower of rules'. [It is true of a lot of people who were] brilliant for society, but not for their personal lives. If we can look at Gautama Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi in their entirety, why not Lord Ram?\\", he concluded. Although unsure as to whether there will be four or five books in the series, Tripathi declared that the first book was named as Scion of Ikshvaku. Ikshvaku was the founder of the Suryavanshi dynasty, to which Rama belonged, and the book deals with how Rama tried to establish his \\"Rama Rajya [The Kingdom of Rama]\\" in the middle of a corrupt Indian society. The story takes place at around 3400 BC, before the Shiva trilogy plotline, the latter having clues about the Rama Chandra series. Like the Shiva trilogy, Scion of Ikshvaku will have philosophy as one of its themes, drawing from Tripathi's understanding of Indian scriptures. The author worked over a year on the series but he did not have to research about the subject, since being born into a religious family (Tripathi's father was a pandit) he was aware of the stories about Rama; he took further inspirations from Valmiki's Ramayana, the Ramcharitmanas, Kamba Ramayanam as well as the Adbhuta Ramayana. Tripathi wrote the story both from a critical point of view about Rama as well as a devotee of him, adding that \\"part of our traditions is also to learn from the stories of our gods\\". He also confirmed a part of the plot, where Ravana wins a war in the story and enforces a trade deal which results in the Sapta Sindhu area to give economic privileges to Lanka. Like the characterization of women in the Shiva trilogy, Tripathi had strong female perspective in Scion of Ikshvaku, including portraying Manthara as a businesswomen. This was a deviation from the original story, where she was a servant. Other concepts explored included the rise and fall of masculine and feminine centric civilisations, as well as using scientific evidence for making the character of Hanuman from the epic as a Naga, a concept introduced in the Shiva trilogy. Marketing and release Actor Akshay Kumar and author Amish Tripathi at the release of the cover for Scion of Ikshvaku. Westland had run a social media contest prior to the revealing of the name, with hashtags like #WhatNextAmish\\" and #MysteryBoxes, containing clues to the subject of the book. A trailer was released on YouTube for the book, which also included a Sanskrit hymn for \\"Rama Rajya\\". The cover art was released on 27 March 2015 at a press conference in Mumbai, unveiled by Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar and Padmanabhan. Creative agency Think Why Not developed the book cover, which depicted Rama, shooting with a bow and an arrow towards Ravana, the latter on his legendary Pushpak Vimana. Like the cover artworks for the Shiva trilogy, the Scion of Ikshvaku cover also had numerous Hieroglyph symbology alongside the main image, to aid readers in deciphering key parts of the story. The author added the symbols as an addendum, basing them on the still undeciphered Indus Valley letters and made them represent how Rama would have been written in the script. Tripathi believed that the imagery had to \\"maintain the high standards of visual appeal that we have set with my earlier book covers. Many of these symbols on the cover and through the books are clues to my stories for those well-versed with Indian scriptures.\\" Release date for the book was revealed as 22 June 2015, with pre-orders starting after the cover was unveiled, including the Hindi version titled Ikshvaku ke Vanshaj. In April 2015, retail website Amazon.com started promoting the book using their existing relationship with the 2015 Indian Premier League (IPL), in-between the cricket matches. The author explained that the core demographic of his book and the IPL was same, hence Amazon.com chose to promote the book there. It was the first time that a book was advertised during the tournament. Westland also set up a Twitter chat where director Karan Johar interviewed Tripathi, and ultimately released the official trailer for the book to YouTube. The trailer starts off with a coin spinning on a map, spelling out the word \\"Ayodhya\\", followed by interspersed scenes of a man chasing someone in a forest, a lady fighting off a group of soldiers, a meteor as well as arrows falling from the sky, and a helicopter like structure flying in the air. Tripathi also released the third chapter of the book on Amazon Kindle for the readers, holding a reading and discussion session also. The release was presided over by actress Gul Panag who shared the same alma mater with the writer. Samir Kumar, Director of Category Management at Amazon.in believed that launching the book through their platform helped the company reach out a larger set of customers, based on the success of Tripathi's previous release. On the release day, Amazon planned midnight delivery of the book to some of the customers, with Tripathi himself being present to deliver it; he had instantly agreed to the idea making the delivered books a collector's edition with his signature. Customers in Mumbai, Bangalore and Delhi were part of this delivery process, with zero shipping costs from the company. Commercial reception According to Amazon.com, they received pre-orders for the book from different sections of India, indicating the continued interest in Tripathi's releases. Pre-orders for the book made it shoot to the top of the charts, and it was noted that the book aimed to oversell the whole of the Shiva trilogy combined. Arunava Sinha from Scroll.in noted that \\"The entire number of pre-orders usually shows up on the charts the very first week, which is why the campaign to get those pre-orders is now the primary target of pre- launch marketing activities for potential blockbusters. What really matters, though, is what will follow in weeks 2 through 20.\\" Controversy erupted when Westland filed a case against online retailer Flipkart, alleging that the company had violated IT Act by selling the book on their website, since they had signed an exclusive deal with Amazon. The case was sub judice under the Delhi High Court, and they declined to pass a restraint order on the sales of the book at Flipkart. Instead they asked the company to provide their responses by 4 August 2015. Rasul Ballay from The Economic Times commented that \\"by when the importance of the controversy would have diluted as most number of copies of an eagerly awaited book like this are generally sold within a month of its launch.\\" Critical response Urmi Chanda-Vaz writes in scroll.in: \\"He has an almost magical ability of retaining the essence of familiar mythological tales while spinning wildly deviant plots...While not a great fan of his literary style, I cannot help but admire Amish for the way he manages to create completely new stories from old ones...for anyone who is familiar with the author's previous works, the book meets all expectations, for Amish bends it better than Beckham... Amish's easy-to-read prose and page- turning style is designed to be accessible and enjoyable. From the looks of it, he is poised to set another best-selling record.\\" Sandipan Deb writes in LiveMint: \\"You can read Ikshvaku either way—as the start of what I hope will be a thrilling series that will bring Ram and Sita closer to a lot of Indians, or as an honest analysis and a very intelligent man’s musings on everything from Manu Smriti to Milton Friedman, all presented in the garb of a series of adventure novels... This is what makes Amish very special among the few Indian bestselling authors we have.\\" Ivinder Gill of Financial Express commented that 'The Scion of Ikshvaku is what could be called a modern take on the Ramayan, with Amish taking the familiar story further, or sideways, with his own interpretation of events. The proverbial poetic licence has been used to maximum limit, as we discover a ladies man in Bharat or a lathi-wielding Sita.' https://www.financialexpress.com/jobs/scion-of-ikshvaku-book-review- discovering-ram/99603/ Sanjeev Sanyal writes in Daily O: \\"In the new series, the author explores the importance of the rule of law... In my view, Amish does well to take the modern reader back to the original philosophical conundrums, especially when he explicitly puts these debates in a modern context... Overall, Scion of Ikshvaku is a fast-paced, action-packed retelling of the Ramayana... I look forward to the next volume in the series.\\" The review in the New Indian Express says, \\"Given the intimidating expectations riding on it, the first novel in Amish’s Ram Chandra series, Scion of Ikshvaku, does not disappoint. Like the Shiva trilogy, this again is not a retelling, but rather a complete re-imagining of the original story using the same characters but with fresh perspectives and modern sensibilities.\\" At the 14th Crossword Book Award held in November 2016, the book won the category of Best Fiction book.

Science Review Dubbed \\"the breast cancer list\\" by Science magazine, the study made headlines by highlighting new hypotheses about environmental risks and showing that common exposures, including diesel and benzene in gasoline, were biologically plausible links to breast cancer.Rudel, Ruthann, K.

Silent Spring's 2003 Household Exposure Study (HES) was the first and most comprehensive assessment of endocrine disruptors in homes; it documented consumer products as the primary source of the chemicals.Betts, Kellyn (2003) \\"Are US Homes a Haven for Toxins\\" in Environmental Science and Technology, pp. 407–11. * Silent Spring began by investigating the links between hormone disruptors and human health among women on Cape Cod. The study, published in 2004, showed that the longer that women lived on Cape Cod, the higher was their breast cancer risk.McKelvey, W., J.G. Brody, A. Aschengrau, and C.H. Swartz (2004) \\"Association between Residence on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and Breast Cancer\\", in Annals of Epidemiology, 14 (2), pp.89–94 Other activities The organization celebrated its twentieth anniversary on October 20, 2014, with a fund-raising dinner at the Royal Sonesta Hotel in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Speakers included New York Times journalist Nicholas Kristof, author Florence Williams and institute director Julia Brody. Ellen Parker of Newton, the chair of the institute's board, received its Rachel Carson Advocacy Award. Reporter Kelley Tuthill of radio station WCVB was the master of ceremonies. Leadership In late 2014 Julia Brody was executive director, and Cynthia Barakatt was chair of the board. Ellen Calmas was a board member. Funding During the seven years after its founding in 1995, the institute received $8.5 million in state grants, but as it prepared to celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2014, state support had vanished and no help at all was granted in the state budget that year. Nor had it been granted in the 2010, 2011 or 2012 fiscal years. Speaking about the falloff in appropriations, Representative Randy Hunt of Sandwich said, according to the Cape Cod Times, that \\"some people associated with Silent Spring have raised hackles.\\" Hunt was quoted as saying that Silent Spring \\"activists\\" had been known to \\"denigrate anyone who they don't feel is pushing for their cause as hard as they want.\\" The Times quoted co-founder Cheryl Osimo as responding, \\"I understand perhaps my passion can be misunderstood as abrasive.\\" She said the loss of funds was caused by a \\"difficult economy,\\" resulting in an increased need for private donations. > Sylvia Connor of East Sandwich, a breast cancer survivor and Silent Spring > volunteer, said . . . that she and other survivors feel strongly about > continuing the work of the research institute.

It is now held at the Musée Condé, Chantilly, France. It is a female nude of the Venus Anadyomene type, showing the goddess Venus rising from the sea. History Ingres began the painting in 1808 during his stay in Rome at the French Academy. The first preparatory drawings showed Venus in the Venus Pudica position, standing and covering her breasts with her hands.Condon, Patricia; Cohn, Marjorie B.; Mongan, Agnes (1983). In Pursuit of Perfection: The Art of J.-A.-D. Ingres. Louisville: The J. B. Speed Art Museum. p. 64. The pose was inspired by Botticelli's The Birth of Venus – Ingres visited Florence and the Uffizi in 1805 and could have seen the painting there. A drawing of 1806 then shows the goddess with her arms in the air and her hair in her hands, a pose the artist also used in his 1856 The Source. The painting remained in the planning stages until 1848, when he completed it as a commission from the banker and botanist Benjamin Delessert. This involved major changes to the colour scheme Ingres had originally planned for the painting. However, in the end Delessert declined the painting since he felt the knee was drawn awkwardly. Later in 1848 the painting was sold to Frédéric Reiset, curator of drawings at the Louvre Museum. It was exhibited at the 1855 Exposition Universelle in Paris, where it was seen by the poet Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire argued that the head was inspired by classical sculpture, the hands by Raphael, and the narrow torso by medieval sculpture. In 1879 this painting and the rest of the Reiset collection were bought by Henri d'Orléans, Duke of Aumale.Radius, Emilio (1968). L'opera completa di Ingres. Milan: Rizzoli. p. 113. It was closely followed by later treatments of the subject, such as Théodore Chassériau's Vénus marine and Bouguereau's 1879 The Birth of Venus. A smaller copy of the painting from c.1825–1850 is in the Louvre and the preparatory drawings are now in the Ingres Museum in Montauban.

It is 90 km in diameter. It was named after British astronomer Axel Firsoff, and the name was approved in 2010. Parts of the crater display many layers, as do some of the other craters in the region. Many places on Mars show rocks arranged in layers. Rock can form layers in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers. There is much evidence that at least some of the layers seen on Mars especially in Firsoff crater involve groundwater.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150327143053.htm There are mounds in the crater that may have formed from springs. They show breccia sometimes a pit at the top. Some of the mounds are lined up along straight fractures. The mound's composition and shape suggest water came out of the mounds and then minerals were precipitated.Pondrelli, M. et al. 2011.

It shows an episode from Homer's Iliad, in which Achilles refuses to listen to the envoys sent by Agamemnon to convince him back into the Trojan War. The topic assigned for the artists competing for the Prix de Rome in 1801 was the warriors' procession toward battle; Ingres' interpretation of the subject characteristically emphasized a moment of psychological drama instead of physical action.Condon et al. 1983, p. 12. The work was intended as a demonstration of Ingres' mastery of the human figure in classical history painting – Odysseus is shown in a red cloak derived from a sculpture by Pseudo-Phidias. The painting is in the neo-classical style and belongs to the school of Jacques-Louis David, in whose studio Ingres had trained. It also shows new influences from John Flaxman, whose work had just had its first Parisian exhibition. Notes Bibliography *Condon, Patricia; Cohn, Marjorie B.; Mongan, Agnes.

He secured the master's degree (DM) from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and subsequently worked at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow and, later, at Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi before joining Medanta the Medicity as Chairman, Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes where he worked from 2009 to 2019. Mithal was honoured by the Government of India in 2015 with Padma Bhushan, the third highest Indian civilian award, for his outstanding contribution to the field of medicine. More recently, in 2019, Dr Mithal has been nominated to the Governing Council of the National Health Authority, the apex body involved in implementing the ambitious population health coverage plan of the government. He has also been appointed (honorary) President, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Gorakhpur. Dr Mithal was awarded the International Osteoporosis Foundation President's award in March 2016. In March 2017 Dr Mithal was awarded the B C Roy award by the President of India (for the year 2015) for his contribution to the development of endocrinology in India. He has won numerous awards from medical and social bodies throughout his career. Dr Mithal is keenly interested in spreading awareness about endocrine disorders among the general public. He writes a regular column in the OPEN magazine, frequently contributes articles in Hindi to the Dainik Jagran, and has been on numerous health shows on TV. He has also hosted a show called 'Beat Diabetes' on NDTV from 2016 onwards, and is frequently interviewed on most other national channels including Doordarshan. He also contributes from time to time to other leading magazines like India Today and The Week, along with popular daily newspapers. EXCERPTS FROM THE PADMA BHUSHAN CITATION (UPDATED SEP 2019) Dr Mithal has made pioneering contribution to the development of the speciality of endocrinology in India in all its aspects- academic, clinical and social- and has played a key role in placing Indian endocrinology on the global map. While at AIIMS- in the mid 1980s- he assisted in studies related to iodine deficiency, which paved the way for the universal salt iodation program in India. Later, when he was on the faculty of Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS), Lucknow, he carried out seminal research on fluoride toxicity in Unnao, UP, which affects more than 60 million people in India. He was subsequently awarded the prestigious Fogarty fellowship to conduct research at Harvard Medical School (1993–94), where he worked on the calcium sensing receptor. In 1997, Dr Mithal established India’s first bone density measurement system and osteoporosis service in SGPGIMS Lucknow. He was the first Indian to be trained in bone density measurement, as a JICA fellow, in Japan. Dr Mithal was the first to establish osteoporosis as a serious health problem in India that affects an estimated 50 million people, and among the first to establish the existence of widespread vitamin D deficiency in India. He is a strong advocate of vitamin D fortification, and has actively lobbied with the government in this regard. At the Food Standards and Safety Authority of India, he played a key advisory role in initiating fortification of edible oil and milk with vitamin D to help tackle vitamin D deficiency in India, a condition which affects more than 80 percent urban Indians. Dr Mithal was the technical advisor for the World Diabetes Foundation/ Jagran Pehel initiative on diabetes and pregnancy- a program that was run across 5 states, with major direct population outreach for spreading awareness among women and schoolgirls. Gestational diabetes affects more than 15 percent of Indian women. He has also led a nutrition and growth program for underprivileged children in two schools. Dr Mithal is the first Indian to serve on international bodies like the WHO Global Task force on Osteoporosis and Committee of Scientific Advisors, Asia Pacific Advisory Council and Board of Governance of the International Osteoporosis Foundation. In addition Dr Mithal has been President of the Endocrine Society of India, Indian Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ISBMR), and Bone and Joint Decade. He has also served two terms as Editor in Chief- Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism. He was a member of the Governing Council of the Indian Council of Medical Research from 2014-2017, and is currently the President of the Endocrine and Diabetes Foundation. Dr Mithal is recognised as an able and popular mentor - students trained by him over the last 25 years occupy positions of importance across the globe. In particular, many of his students have helped establish endocrinology as a speciality across India -providing high quality patient care and achieving academic excellence. Dr Ambrish Mithal is the first and only Indian to receive the \\"Boy Frame Award\\" of the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research (Adult Bone and Mineral Working Group), in 2004. He also received the International Osteoporosis Foundation Health Professional Awareness award (for ISBMR) in 2005. His paper on \\"Global Vitamin D Status’ was awarded the Springer citation prize in 2013. His recent paper (2018) on use of Empagliflozin for treating fatty liver has generated great interest globally and has been widely cited. He has received numerous awards from various Indian associations, including Doctor of the year (2005), \\"Distinguished contribution in the field of medicine\\", \\"Medical statesman of the year\\" and others.

Bárbara Eschenburg and Ingeborg Güssow, \\"El Romanticismo y el Realismo\\" in Los maestros de la pintura occidental, Taschen, 2005, p. 428, Ingres offered instead to fulfill the commission by finishing two paintings already in progress, Joan of Arc and a Virgin with a Host. Both were subjects he had depicted in earlier works: he had made a wash drawing of Joan of Arc as a model for an engraving by Pollet that was published in the 1840s in La Plutarque français, Vies des hommes et femmes illustres de la France by E. Mannechet. The drawing shows her in a pose similar to that of the later painting, dressed in armor and resting her hand on an altar, but with no accompanying figures. For the painting Ingres made new preparatory drawings using a nude model. He then made drawings in which he added the clothes and armour.P. F. R.

Unlike other cabinetmakers of the time Dasson began his career as a bronze sculptor, and consequently one characteristic of his work is the quality of his bronze and more precisely of the chiselling. His Paris workshop was situated at 106 rue Vieille-du-Temple, where he specialised in the production of Louis XIV, XV and XVI style furniture using the finest gilt-bronze mounts. In 1871, he purchased the flourishing business and remaining stock of Charles-Guillaume Winckelsen, known for the high quality of his furniture. It has been suggested that Dasson inherited the craft of ciseleur from Winckelsen. At the 1878 and 1889 Paris Expositions Universelles Dasson exhibited a number of pieces in the Louis XV and XVI styles, as well as pieces of his own modified eighteenth-century design. The exhibits in 1878 included a table entirely in gilt-bronze, purchased by Lord Dudley. His copy of the celebrated Bureau du Roi sold at the same exhibition to Lady Ashburton. Dasson ceased production in 1894, and at this time held a sale of his models, listed in 'Catalogues of drawings for art bronzes, style furniture and important decoration with rights of reproduction by Henry Dasson et Cie, manufacturer of art bronzes and cabinetmaker as a result of cessation of production..' The records from this sale show that Paul Sormani, as well as Joseph Emmanuel Zweiner, Maison Millet and Beurdeley acquired certain drawings and models by Dasson.  Bibliography   p. 269, pls.

The work was jointly commissioned in 1940 by CBS and the New York Philharmonic and was completed March 29, 1941, though Herrmann revised the work in 1973. It premiered July 27, 1941 at the CBS Radio Theater, with Herrmann conducting the CBS Symphony Orchestra. Though he would continue to compose concert music and film scores throughout his later life, the symphony would be Herrmann's last foray into nonprogrammatic music.Smith, p. 88-89 Style and composition The symphony has a duration of roughly 35 minutes and is composed in four movements: #Maestoso: Allegro pesante #Scherzo #Andante sostenuto #Rondo: Epilogue à la processional On the experience of composing absolute music, Herrmann said, \\"For the first time I was not confined to the outline of a story. It was not necessary to depict waves, portray the anguish of a lost soul, or look for a love theme... Consequently, working on the Symphony I had a Roman holiday.\\" Albert Imperato of Gramophone compared the music favorably with that of other 20th century composers Samuel Barber, William Walton, and William Schuman. Reception Initial critical response to the symphony was favorable, though the work has fallen into relative obscurity since its premiere. In 2011, Brian Gittis of The Paris Review called the work \\"an underappreciated symphony.\\" Gramophone's Albert Imperato also argued for a reassessment of the piece, calling it \\"more than a curiosity.\\" Herrmann biographer Steven C.

Between 1952 and 1957 he was head of the country's Military Intelligence (Verwaltung für Allgemeine Fragen) service. Following the discovery of security breaches, on 31 August 1957 he was reduced in rank to reserve colonel. Life =Early years= Karl Linke was born in Görsdorf, then on the north-western frontier of Bohemia which was a quarter in the industrial town of Grottau, and part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. At the time the town was bi-lingual, but following the creation in 1918 of Czechoslovakia the official language would become Czech in 1920. Linke came from a working-class family. He left school and undertook an apprenticeship in weaving in 1914, working as a weaver in a factory till 1918. Meanwhile, he joined the SAJ, which was effectively a youth branch of the Social Democratic party. In 1918, in the closing months of the war, he reached the age of 18 and joined the army. A brief period as an Italian prisoner of war ensued. =To Germany and then to Czechoslovakia= When the Italians released him his home town was in Czechoslovakia and Linke took a cleaning job in Senftenberg, across the frontier in Germany. It was here that in 1920 he joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD / Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands). In 1923 he recrossed the frontier into Czechoslovakia. Here, between 1923 and 1929, he worked as a weaver. He was, till 1930, a member of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, also working as a smuggler for the German Communist Party. While living in Czechoslovakia he played a leading role in a strike in 1927/28, and was later arrested for taking photographs without permission at the steel works in Witkowitz, possibly in connection with his work for the Berlin-based Arbeiter- Illustrierte-Zeitung (Workers Pictorial Newspaper). =To the Soviet Union= Linke was able to emigrate to the Soviet Union in 1930, accompanied by his second wife, whom he had married the previous year after the death of his first wife a few years earlier. He joined the Soviet Communist Party (КПСС), remaining a member till 1951. He worked in Moscow as a Master Weaver till 1934. After that, from 1935 till 1939, he worked in a clerical position in the Ministry for Light Industry. In 1939 he took a clerical job with the Chamber of Commerce in Moscow. =War= From the Soviet perspective the Great Patriotic War began in June 1941. In defiance of the existing non-aggression pact the German army invaded the Soviet Union. In July 1941 Karl Linke and his son Heinz both volunteered to join the Red Army, where one of Linke's roles was as a commissar in a partisan division, a role that for two years he combined with that of a (Communist) \\"Party Secretary\\" in the partisan group. In this capacity he took part in parachute operations behind German lines in the Gomel region. During 1944 as the leader of a reconnaissance group he took part in armed Slovakian partisan operations and then in the Slovak National Uprising against the Axis government which erupted between August and October 1944. The war ended in the early summer of 1945 and Karl Linke returned to Moscow, suffering from wounds endured in the war and on account of the death of his son Heinz who had been killed while fighting with the Slovak partisans. =To Czechoslovakia and then to (East) Germany= In 1946 Karl Linke returned to Czechoslovakia, between 1946 and 1949 taking a middle management job in a tape weaving factory in Hrádek nad Nisou (\\"Grottau\\" in some older German sources). Fifteen years in the Soviet Union had left him with fluent Russian, and Linke then moved on, at the end of 1949, to Berlin where between 1950 and 1951 he worked as a simultaneous translator for the Soviet representative in the Allied Control Council. The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) had been formally founded (from what had previously been designated the Soviet occupation zone) in October 1949, and in 1951 Karl Linke and his wife both took East German citizenship. In 1952 Karl Linke joined the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands) which since its controversial creation in April 1946 had become the ruling party, as part of a return to one-party government within this Soviet sponsored version of Germany. He then, till 1952, became a departmental director and head of the presidential secretariat with the State Planning Commission. On 1 June 1952 he joined the Kasernierte Volkspolizei, a quasi-military division of the East German Police Service which would later come to be seen as the precursor to the country's national army. He was promoted to the rank of major general within the service in October 1952. More importantly, between 1952 and 1957 he served as chief of the German Democratic Republic's \\"Verwaltung für Allgemeine Fragen und Aufklärung\\". English-language sources sometimes translate this as \\"Military Intelligence Service\\" although until 1956 East Germany was not permitted an army of its own. Linke enjoyed the full confidence of the country's Soviet sponsors and his time in charge saw early successes for the service which was well supported by the political establishment. There was a move from Pankow to new premises in central Berlin (Behrenstraße 42-45) and in 1956 a change of name to \\"Verwaltung 19\\" (\\"Administration [department] 19\\") apparently in order to conceal the true nature of the organisation. By 1957 it was clear that regardless of its new name, \\"Verwaltung 19\\" under Karl Linke had been penetrated by western intelligence at a high level. Suspicion fell in particular on Siegfried Dombrowski who was placed under close counter- intelligence surveillance in February 1957, and who had entered the service, like Linke, via the Kasernierte Volkspolizei. The memoirs of Reinhard Gehlen, the West German intelligence chief would later confirm that from 1956 Dombrowski was indeed supplying intelligence both to West German Intelligence and to the American CIA,Klaus Behling: Der Nachrichtendienst der NVA. Das Neue Berlin, 2005, , p. 219 ff and in August 1958 Dombrowski fled to the west, although the extent of the information he provided remains unclear. Closer to home in July 1957 Karl Linke's housekeeper, Anna Kubiak, disappeared, accompanied by \\"sensitive documents\\", and leaving behind her a West German passport in his name and ten thousand Marks in cash for a \\"start in a better life\\". Linke's own household had been penetrated by the CIA's \\"Agent Martha\\". On 30 August 1957 an army personnel chief reported that Karl Linke would be pensioned off at his own wish. He was reduced in rank to colonel. He was also given a ban on entering Berlin. He retired to Zittau, near to the frontier with Czechoslovakia, and it was here that he died on 16 May 1961.

The painting is now lost. Between 1819 and 1832, Ingres painted three additional paintings of the subject. History Episodes from the life of Henri IV were a frequent subject for French painters in Ingres' time.Condon, Patricia; Cohn, Marjorie B.; Mongan, Agnes (1983). In Pursuit of Perfection: The Art of J.-A.-D. Ingres. Louisville: The J. B. Speed Art Museum. p. 238. . The incident depicted in this painting was described by Ingres in one of his notebooks: > One day Don Pedro of Toledo, the Ambassador of Spain to the court of Henri > IV, saw in the Louvre the sword of the King in the hands of a young page. > Advancing, he knelt on the ground and kissed it, rendering honor, he said, > to the most glorious sword in Christendom. The artist painted four versions of the subject between 1814 and 1832. The original version was painted in 1814 and exhibited at the Paris Salon that year, where it was disparaged by critics.Radius, Emilio (1968). L'opera completa di Ingres. Milan: Rizzoli. p. 96. After even Ingres' friends found fault with it, Ingres reworked it in 1820. The revised composition included the figures of the Duc d'Epernon and Gabrielle d'Estrées behind the ambassador and the page.Condon, Patricia; Cohn, Marjorie B.; Mongan, Agnes (1983). In Pursuit of Perfection: The Art of J.-A.-D. Ingres. Louisville: The J. B. Speed Art Museum. p. 78. The location of the painting since the mid-19th century is unknown. The composition of the painting before its revision is recorded in an engraving by Achille Réveil published in 1851. A second version (1819; now at the château de Pau) was painted for Ingres' friend, the artist Jean Alaux. It closely replicates the initial composition of the 1814 version: In the background at the left stands a guard; an unidentified figure is exiting at the right. This version was displayed in the 2014 exhibition L'invention du Passé. Histoires de cœur et d'épée 1802–1850 at the musée des beaux-arts de Lyon. In the third painting (1820; acquired for the Louvre Abu Dhabi in 2009), Ingres moved the row of caryatids from the left edge of the composition to the center, and reversed the angle of the perspective. The figures of the Duc d'Epernon and Gabrielle d'Estrées are once again in the background at the left. The painting was previously in a private collection in Oslo. The fourth version (1832; acquired by the Louvre Museum in 1981)Condon, Patricia; Cohn, Marjorie B.; Mongan, Agnes (1983). In Pursuit of Perfection: The Art of J.-A.-D. Ingres. Louisville: The J. B. Speed Art Museum. pp. 80–81. is slightly smaller than the others. The setting is changed from the Salle des Caryatides to the Stairway of Henri II, and the number of onlookers is augmented by the inclusion of the poet François de Malherbe, Cardinal Jacques Davy Duperron, and an unidentified man.

It was founded in 1836 by branching off from its ancestor, the League of Outlaws (German: Bund der Geächteten), which had formed in Paris in 1834. The League of the Just was largely composed of German emigrant artisans. In 1847, the League of the Just merged with the Communist Correspondence Committee, an organization led by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, creating the Communist League. The new group tasked Marx and Engels with writing a political platform for itself. The resulting document was The Communist Manifesto.  History  Theodore Schuster founded the League of Outlaws in Paris in 1834. He modeled the organization closely after Philippe Buonarroti's vision of the \\"Universal Democratic Carbonari\\" as an egalitarian international revolutionary fellowship organization, perhaps the first of its kind. Its members were German emigrants. Schuster's 1834 pamphlet, Confession of faith of an outlaw has been suggested as the first vision of marginalized people joining together in a coming revolution. At its peak, the League of Outlaws had about 100 members in Paris and 80 in Frankfurt am Main. At this time, Schuster focused his efforts on advocating for the unification of Germany and organized middle-class republicans into the League of Germans. As Schuster's and other key members' attention was focused on this work, the working class members of the Outlaws rallied around the leadership of Wilhelm Weitling. This group formed the League of the JustWhile in most literature the group is referred to as \\"Bund der Gerechten\\" (League of the Just), the German historian Waltraud Seidel- Höppner has, based on new archival sources, argued that the group itself used the name \\"Bund der Gerechtigkeit\\" (League of Justice) in Paris in 1836 as an offshoot from the League of Outlaws. The Outlaws dissipated in 1838 as their members prioritized other associations. Members of the League of the Just were German journeymen artisans, primarily tailors and woodworkers. Their stated goal was \\"the establishment of the Kingdom of God on Earth, based on the ideals of love of one's neighbor, equality and justice\\".G.N. Volkov et al., The Basics of Marxist-Leninist Theory. Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1979. This was also referred to by the League as the \\"new Jerusalem\\". The motto of the League of the Just was \\"All men are brothers\\". They have been described as followers of François-Noël Babeuf and as \\"utopian-communist\\". They were anticipating a social revolution, which one of their leaders, Karl Schapper, described as \\"the great resurrection day of the people.\\" Friedrich Engels wrote dismissively of the League as essentially similar to other French secret societies except that it was German. The latter league had a pyramidal structure inspired by the secret society of the Republican Carbonari, and shared ideas with Saint-Simon and Charles Fourier's utopian socialism. Their goal was to establish a \\"Social Republic\\" in the German states which would campaign for \\"freedom\\", \\"equality\\" and \\"civic virtue\\". Wilhelm Weitling was the most prominent leader in the movement. Weitling proclaimed himself a \\"social Luther\\" and denounced private property and money as a source of corruption and exploitation. Other significant leaders included Karl Schapper, Bruno Bauer, Joseph Moll, August Hermann Ewerbeck, and Johann Hoeckerig. Many members of the League of the Just were involved in the 12 May 1839 Blanquist revolt.Bernard Moss, \\"Marx and the Permanent Revolution in France: Background to the Communist Manifesto,\\" in The Communist Manifesto Today: The Socialist Register, 1998. New York: Monthly Review Press; pg.10. This led to the group being expelled by the French government. They proceeded to move to London. In 1840 in London they established a front organization called the Educational Society of German Workingmen. They continued to grow, until reaching a peak membership of over 1,000 people. In 1845 there was significant public debate within the League between Weitling, who advocated for an immediate uprising of workers, and Karl Schapper, who considered this premature, especially after his experience in the 1839 uprising. Schapper advocated for a longer campaign of popular education to prepare the masses for revolution. Karl Marx was hesitant about joining the League due to political disagreements, but was convinced by Joseph Moll that he could be more influential debating as a member from within the organization when Moll visited Brussels in January 1847. In June 1847, the League of the Just merged with the Communist Correspondence Committee to form the Communist League.

The person experiences pain and a sudden severe clouding of vision, with the cornea taking on a translucent milky-white appearance known as a corneal hydrops. Diagnosis Patients are recommended to take a Sodium Chloride eye drop solution as well as a Dexamethasone solution for a period of 4-6 weeks, timeframes may vary depending on the severity of a patients condition. Once the medication cycle is complete and the cloud clears, scarring will be left on the cornea.  Management  The effect is normally temporary and after a period of six to eight weeks, the cornea usually returns to its former transparency. The recovery can be aided nonsurgically by bandaging with an osmotic saline solution. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory topical may be used to reduce the pain and inflammation.

It is not the same party as the modern-day Maki, which split from it during the 1960s and later assumed its name. History Maki election poster from first Knesset electionMaki was a descendant of the Palestine Communist Party (PCP), which changed its name to MAKEI (the Communist Party of Eretz Yisrael) after endorsing partition in 1947, and then to Maki. Members of the National Liberation League, an Arab party that had split from the PCP in 1944, rejoined Maki in October 1948, giving the party both Jewish and Israeli Arab members, while the Hebrew Communists also joined the party. It also took over publication of two communist newspapers, Kol HaAm (Hebrew) and Al-Ittihad (Arabic). The party was not Zionist, but recognized Israel, though it denied the link between the state and the Jewish diaspora, and asserted the right of Palestinians to form a state in accordance with the United Nations resolution on partition. In the first Knesset election in 1949, the party won 3.5% of the vote and four seats, which were taken by Shmuel Mikunis, Eliezer Preminger, Tawfik Toubi and Meir Vilner. During the session, Preminger left the party and re-established the Hebrew Communists before joining Mapam. In the 1951 election Maki won 4% of the vote and five seats, with Emil Habibi and Esther Vilenska entering the Knesset. During the session, the Prague Trials of 1952 caused the pro-Soviet Labour Zionist party Mapam to break with the Soviet Union. Unhappy at the decision, Mapam members Avraham Berman and Moshe Sneh left Mapam and set up the Left Faction before joining Maki. The party was also involved in the fall of Moshe Sharett's fifth government, when it and Herut brought a motion of no confidence over the government's position on the trial of Malkiel Gruenwald, who had accused Rudolf Kastner of collaborating with the Nazis. In the 1955 election, Maki's share of the vote increased again as it claimed six seats in the Knesset. It launched a Polish-language newspaper, Walka, in 1958. However, the 1959 election saw the party perform poorly, winning only three seats. The 1961 election campaign was helped by the ruling coalition's involvement in the Lavon Affair, and Maki gained five seats. However, during the early 1960s tensions within the party intensified between the largely Jewish faction of Moshe Sneh and Shmuel Mikunis, which considered Israeli national interests and accepted Israel's right to exist, and the mostly Arab faction of Meir Vilner, which accepted the Soviet pro-Arab and anti-Zionist stance without reservations.Коммунистическая партия в Израиле Jewish Encyclopedia in Russian The internal disagreements finally led to a split in 1965, with Sneh's faction retaining the name Maki, while the pro- Palestinian faction (Tawfik Toubi and Meir Vilner) left to form Rakah (\\"New Communist List\\"), which the Soviet Union recognised as the \\"official\\" Communist Party. It was reported in the Soviet media that the Mikunis-Sneh group had defected to the bourgeois-nationalist camp. The 1965 election was a disaster; the party retained only one seat, and was beaten by Rakah who gained three seats. Maki repeated its poor performance in the 1969 election despite its support for the Six-Day War.Сне Моше Jewish Encyclopedia in Russian Maki merged with the Blue-Red Movement in 1973, to form Moked, and subsequently disappeared as an independent party. Moked won one seat in the 1973 election. Later it became part of Left Camp of Israel (in 1977), then Ratz (in 1981). In the meantime, Rakah had become the leading force in the Hadash alliance, which it joined in 1977. In 1989, several years after Maki's demise, Rakah decided to change its name and take up the now unclaimed name Maki, to reflect its status as the only officially communist party in Israel. Party leaders asserted at the time that their party, rather than the rival faction that merged among the forces of the Zionist Left, had the better claim upon the historic heritage of what the name stood for in the 1950s and early 1960s. Maki remains the leading force in Hadash to this day. For its later history, see Maki (current political party).

Part of the Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF), it shares a runway with Bergen Airport, Flesland. The air station has since 1999 had a mobilization status and is only manned with six employees. Its main structure is an subterranean hangar with space for 25 fighter jets. Construction began in 1952 and the following year the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) issued grants for a long runway. The facility cost 70 million Norwegian krone and opened on 14 September 1954. Flesland was never the permanent base of any squadrons. Its role was intended as a forward operating base for the United States Air Force (USAF) in case the Cold War turned hot. From about 1966 Flesland became a forward storage facility for nuclear warheads, which could be moved to the air station in case of war. From 1985 the became operational as a collocated operating base, with supplies and facilities for USAF aircraft. Flesland Air Station was gradually mothballed during the 1990s. History =Prelude= The first military air base to serve Bergen was Bergen Naval Air Station, situated on the island of Flatøy in what is today Meland. Construction was started in 1917 and was commissioned in August 1919.Hafsten & Arheim: 40 It served as one of the four main air stations for the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service until 1940.Hafsten & Arheim: 42 During the 1930s there were launched plans to build a land airport in Bergen. Flesland, which was at the time located in the then independent municipality of Fana, was one alternative. The other main alternative was Herdla, the northernmost island in Askøy. The main disadvantage with Flesland was the topography and that it would not be possible to build longer runways than , respectively.Østerbø: 40 After the German invasion of Norway in April 1940, the Wehrmacht started looking for a location for an airstrip. They were partially in need for a counteraction against British raids and in part in need to protect German ship traffic. Four locations were considered: Nesttun, Haukåsmyrene in Åsane, Flesland and Herdla. The choice of Herdla was taken after a German bomber emergency landed in a field and was later able to take off from there. Herdla Airport received two runways, the longest . General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and a Braathens SAFE Boeing 737-200 at Flesland in 1981 The Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) started working on plans for an airport for Bergen in 1947. Herdla was by them seen as the prime candidate, predominantly due to the rugged topography around Bergen.Østerbø: 43 The CAA recommended that Herdla be chosen and that the two runways be expanded. However, its director, Einar Bøe, was skeptical to the Herdla plans, citing the lack of possibilities to extend the runway past the initially proposed and the long travel distance from Herdla to the city. At the time there was no bridge neither from Herdla to Askøy nor from Askøy to the mainland, nor was there a road across the island. Transport would therefore have to be carried out from Bergen using a ferry. The Minister of Transport and Communications Nils Langhelle from Bergen supported Bøe's concerns and recommended that Parliament place construction of an airport serving Bergen on hold.Østerbø: 44 Engineering reports were made of both Herdla and Flesland in 1950 and 1951. Previous investigations of Flesland had concluded that the length of the runway was limited to a small valley which is located at about the middle of the current runway. The new report proposed connecting the proposed area to a larger area to the south of the valley, which was at the right elevation. This would allow for a runway.Østerbø: 46 A political concern was the high cost of constructing a new airport.Østerbø: 63 =Construction= General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon of the United States Air Force's 4th Tactical Fighter Squadron in January 1981—the first ever overseas deployment of the F-16 At the same time the Royal Norwegian Air Force stated looking at Flesland as a suitable air station. Military engineers surveyed the area and concluded that it was well-suited for military purposes. NATO granted funding for seven air stations in Norway in 1952, but these did not include Flesland.Østerbø: 64 Financing was instead secured through a national military communications project, of which NOK 16 million was set aside over a period of three years, which would secure construction of a runway. A further NOK 4 million was presumed financed by the municipalities of Bergen and Fana to build a terminal, expropriation and a road. The plans were passed by Parliament on 25 April 1952. The military funding was arranged by Langhelle, who by then had been appointed Minister of Defence. Flesland received additional NATO grants in 1953, allocating NOK 50 million. The Ministry of Defence paid the remaining NOK 5 million. The increased funding allowed the runway to be extended to .Østerbø: 66 Construction started on 14 August 1952 with construction of a road from Blomsterdalen.Østerbø: 53 Work on the airport lot itself started in early 1953. Between 200 and 300 people partook in the construction, some of which lived in sheds at Nordheim. Work was carried out in two shifts. Thirty farms were partially expropriated. Half a million cubic meters (18 million cu ft) of rock were blasted and a similar amount of earthwork moved in the construction process. The work consisted of a runway and an equivalently long taxiway, although it was only half the width. The terminal building cost NOK 200,000 and was located next to a parking lot with place for seventy cars. A long barbed wire fence circumferenced the airport.Østerbø: 56 The airport had instrument landing system from the start.Østerbø: 78 Two people were killed in the construction, which had a total cost of NOK 70 million. =Operational history= Westland Sea King of the 330 Squadron The first aircraft to land at the airport was a de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter of the air force on 18 June 1954. At the time of the runway was completed. Later that year the paved section was extended to and several Douglas DC-3 aircraft landed.Østerbø: 72 The military officially took the airport into use on 14 September 1954. The official civilian opening took place on 2 October 1955. By then the airport had a temporary terminal and control tower, the airport road was not paved, aviation fuel tanks were not installed and there was no snow-removal equipment.Østerbø: 69 The 338 Squadron was temporarily moved to Flesland for the summer of 1958, while the runway at Ørland Main Air Station was upgraded.Arheim: 150 A contentious issue arose in the late 1950s concerning the storage of American nuclear warheads in Norway. For Western Norway Sola Air Station was designated as such a site.Skogrand & Tamnes: 254 By 1959 the plans were changed and instead Flesland was selected as a Norwegian site along with Bodø Main Air Station for Class C warheads, to be used with attack aircraft.Skogrand & Tamnes: 257 Work commenced in 1964 and by 1966 the special ammunition storage (SAS) was taken into use. Flesland would in this capacity be placed under command of Allied Forces Northern Europe and serve the Third Air Force of the USAF.Skogrand & Tamnes: 261 Nuclear weapon components are presumed to have been stored at Flesland, although the actually warheads presumably never have.Skogrand & Tamnes: 263 With the establishment of SAS, Flesland became an important NATO training station. The logistics surrounding the use by a strike force, Operation Dovetail, was carried out every four to eight weeks.Skogrand & Tamnes: 212 Every other year there were larger exercises with about a dozen aircraft and lasting for several weeks.Østerbø: 92 It is believed that in case of a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union, the nuclear warheads would be transferred to Flesland from other sites in Europe, ready for the arrival of the attack aircraft.Skogrand & Tamnes: 214 The confidentiality meant that most of the RNoAF was unknown to Flesland's strategic role and in the late 1960s the airport was proposed closed in the late 1960s by parts of the RNoAF unaware of its function. This caused the American strike force to also receive a conventional role, which could be made public and be used as a public excuse to retain the operational level at Flesland.Skogrand & Tamnes: 213 A Mark 82 bomb on a bomb loader during an American Cold War exercise at Flesland The Norwegian High Command and the United States Air Force agreed on 29 May 1974 that there would be established nine collocated operating bases (COB) in Norway, including Flesland. This involved establishing nine air stations which in case of crisis and war could act as forward operating bases for about six hundred US aircraft. In addition to ground support for the aircraft and crew, it involved the stationing of spare parts, ammunition and fuel. The COBs were completed in 1985. By 1993 the US was no longer interested in them and Flesland lost this status from 1994.Arheim: 62 In early 1981 the United States Air Force's 4th Tactical Fighter Squadron visited Flesland. This was the first time operational General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons were deployed outside the United States.Arheim: 224 A new control tower was taken into use in 1991.Avinor: 29 With the ending of the Cold War following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the military activity at Flesland diminished. Planning of the downgrading of the air station had started in 1988, and from 1995 only personnel necessary for maintaining infrastructure was left, reducing the crew to 33. The final demise of the air station came in 1999, when all stationary assets were sold, including 30 vehicles. The daily operation of the air station was transferred to the Royal Norwegian Navy, who have six employees at the base. Flesland Air Station has since only held mobilization status and will only be used by the air force in case of war and larger emergencies.Østerbø: 96 Facilities General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons of the United States Air Force's 4th Tactical Fighter Squadron in January 1981—the first ever overseas deployment of the F-16 Flesland is a joint military and civilian airport, situated at Flesland, westernmost in the Ytrebygda borough of Bergen, Norway. The air station takes up the northeastern section of the aerodrome area, and shares the runway and taxiway system with the civilian section. Flesland Air Station has mobilization status and will under current plans only taken into use during war. In this state its limited facilities are maintained by the Royal Norwegian Navy, which have six employees working at the base. This consists of some activity in the COB hangar, the technical workshop and some storage areas. The RNoAF retains ownership of most of the aerodrome, including the squadron area, a buffer zone around it, as well as the runway and the parallel taxiway.Avinor: 8 The runway is designated 17/35, roughly north–south, and measures . This includes a overrun at each end which is only used under military rules. The overruns and on the inside of each threshold are concrete—the rest being asphalt.Avinor: 20 There is a parallel taxiway for the length of the runway.Avinor: 21 Both directions have full category I instrument landing system, including precision approach path indicator. Both primary and secondary radar are installed.Avinor: 22 The squadron area features a series of hardened aircraft shelters which are connected by means of a taxiway.Avinor: 44 The centerpiece is a subterranean hall, the COB hangar, which has capacity for twenty-five fighter aircraft. These also include barracks and commando facilities.Østerbø: 91 Future The Norwegian Defence Estates Agency, the owner of the facility, stated in 2011 that they may in the future sell the property. This is part of a national coordination project where Avinor and the military have agreed to allow the primary user of each joint aerodrome to become the owner of the facility.Avinor: 9 Avinor estimates that the amount of traffic at Flesland will exceed the capacity of a single runway by 2025. The agency has therefore proposed that a second runway be built. Due to requirements of it being at least from the existing runway, the only suitable site is at the squadron area of the air station. It is proposed to have a length of .Avinor: 41 References Bibliography  * * Category:Airports in Vestland Category:Royal Norwegian Air Force stations Category:Military installations in Bergen Category:Airports established in 1954 Category:1954 establishments in Norway ","title":"Flesland Air Station"},{"id":"45313746","text":"Euclidia munita is a moth of the family Erebidae first described by Jacob Hübner in 1813.

It has been shown that the N-terminal domains of members of the plasminogen/hepatocyte growth factor family, the apple domains of the plasma prekallikrein/coagulation factor XI family, and domains of various nematode proteins belong to the same module superfamily, the PAN module. The PAN domain contains a conserved core of three disulfide bridges. In some members of the family there is an additional fourth disulfide bridge that links the N- and C-termini of the domain. The apple domain, as well as other examples of the PAN domain, consists of 7 β-strands that fold into a curved antiparallel sheet cradling an α-helix. Two disulfide bonds lock the helix onto the central β4 and β5 strands, whereas a third connects the N- and C-termini of the domain.

Beliefs  The Communion of Western Orthodox Churches maintains traditional Orthodox beliefs and practice, accepting and affirming the first three Ecumenical Councils. While also affirming all of the theological and doctrinal statements of the latter four great councils, the rejects the application to the Oriental Orthodox Churches of those councils' condemnations of monophysitism. Therefore, the communion recognises both the Oriental Orthodox churches and Eastern Orthodox churches as sister churches.  Relations with other churches  Written into the directives of the are provisions for accepting other Orthodox churches which also subscribe to its charter and principles. The acceptance of other Christian churches which adhere to the principles set forth in the Charter and to the uses, advice and directives of the Communion is subject to the unanimous agreement of the signatory churches.

He is the Founder and CEO of SaveLIFE Foundation, and best known for his work to pass a Good Samaritan Law in India. In 2016, GQ Magazine named him as one of the most influential young Indians. In 2014, Tewari was featured as an expert on Satyamev Jayate, a popular TV show on social issues, hosted by actor Aamir Khan. The episode Tewari was featured in was focused on the epidemic of road accidents in India. He is also an empaneled speaker with The Outstanding Speakers Bureau, and is the subject of \\"The Golden Hour\\", a feature documentary produced by Roma Sur and Jessica McGough of the Film School at University of Colorado, Denver, USA. He is a commentator on Road Safety in Indian media and has been covered by the New York Times, TIME Magazine, and National Geographic, among other media outlets. Early life and career Tewari was born in Kanpur, India to Reena and Vinay Tewari on May 19, 1980. Tewari finished high school from Naval Public School in New Delhi. He holds a Bachelor of Information Technology degree from Delhi University, and a Master of Public Administration degree from Harvard University. During his time in college, Tewari was actively involved with AIESEC, a global student-led non- profit. Immediately after college, he joined the India Brand Equity Fund (IBEF), an initiative of the Government of India. Following his stint at IBEF, in 2006 he joined the Calibrated Group — a US-based private-equity firm. In 2008, he became the Managing Director of the company’s operations in India. SaveLIFE Foundation Tewari founded the SaveLIFE Foundation (SLF) on February 29, 2008, following the death of a young cousin in a road crash. In response to the tragedy, he studied the issue of road safety and discovered that over 1 million people had been killed in road crashes in India in the previous decade. He also discovered that 50% of these deaths were due to lack of timely care, as confirmed by the Law Commission of India in its 201st report. SLF started by training police and Indian citizens to become better responders to the injured. Over time, the organization started advocating for systemic changes to save lives. In 2015, Tewari and SLF got a ban imposed on trucks from carrying protruding rods. In 2016, SLF, through a written petition to the Supreme Court of India, successfully lobbied for a Good Samaritan Law in India as a provision protecting personal well-being. In 2017, a bill recommended by SLF to improve road safety in the country was passed by the Lok Sabha. SLF is now focusing on implementation of road safety best-practices. As part of that focus, it has adopted the Mumbai-Pune Expressway to make it fatality-free by 2020.  Personal life  Tewari has two siblings: a sister, Neha and a brother, Anshul. Anshul is the founder of Youth Ki Awaaz, the largest youth-based media platform in India.

It is 5 mi (8 km) west-northwest of the city centre. It stands in a lofty position at 918 ft (280 m) above sea level, on a ridge between Bradfield Dale and the valley of the Ughill Brook. It has traditionally been a farming community, but there was some mining in the area in the late 19th and 20th century. Ughill Hall was the scene of an infamous murder in September 1986. The hamlet falls within the Stannington ward of the City. History Ughill is thought to have been founded in the 10th century by a group of Norwegian Vikings with the name deriving from the Old Norse language as Uhgil meaning Uha's Valley or Uggagil meaning Uggi's Valley. In the Old Norse language, gil is a steep-sided valley. Worrall family from Ughill Gives details of name meaning. Ughill was one of six small estates in Hallamshire named in the Domesday Book of 1086, these included the nearby settlements of Holdworth, Worrall and Onesacre. Just prior to the Norman conquest of England Ughill had developed into an Anglo-Saxon farming holding under the control of Healfdene or Aldene who was Lord of approximately 50 settlements, mainly across Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Suffolk. Open Domesday Gives details of Healfdene‘s settlements. After the Conquest ownership of Ughill was taken over by Roger de Busli who was given large swathes of land across Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire for his part in the Conquest. In the Domesday Book Ughill had a taxable value of 1.8 geld units with two plough lands and one league of woodland. Open Domesday Gives details of Ughill in Domesday Book. Ughill was mentioned in documents in the late 13th century when the Lord of Hallamshire Thomas de Furnival granted local herbage rights to Ellys and all men of Ughill. Around 1290, the first mention of the Ughil family was recorded in the manor when John the son of John de Ughil was mentioned in a deed, Adam de Ughil and Roger de Ughil were mentioned at a later date, so the surname had become hereditary but it did not survive. By the 15th century, the Marriott family had settled in Ughill, they were another Norman family who rose from modest beginnings to become minor gentry throughout Hallamshire. John Marriott took over a farm in the low-lying part of Ughill in 1442 and was succeeded at the farm by several generations of John Marriotts up to the 17th century. Thomas Marriott (1679–1754) became Lord of the Manor in the early part of the 18th century, where he was styled Mr Marrott of Ughill Hall. Marriott was a Dissenter who in 1743 built Underbank Chapel, four km to the east at Stannington. Thomas was succeeded by his brother Benjamin but the male lineage then failed, ending the Marriotts family’s connection with Ughill after 300 years. Rotherhamweb The Marriotts of Ughill.\\"Historic Hallamshire\\", David Hey, Landmark Collectors Library, , Gives general history of Ughill. Buildings =Ughill Manor= Ughill Manor is a farmhouse which dates from the early 18th century, however buildings have existed on the site from a much earlier date with timbers from the adjoining cruck barn being dated to 1504. Ughill Manor and its barn and cow house are Grade II listed buildings. =Ughill Hall= Ughill Hall is a substantial stone residence which has been much altered over the years, it existed in a form much different from the present day building in the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042–1066). For many years it was the home of the Marriotts. In more recent times the hall was owned by Charles Vickers who used it as a summer shooting lodge and then by Mr. Lomas, the owner of some of the mines in the surrounding area. The adjacent Ughill Hall farm is still a working farm. Local Mouth Gives details of Ughill Hall. Ughill Hall shootings The Ughill Hall shootings occurred on 21 September 1986 at Ughill Hall in Bradfield near Sheffield. Ian Wood shot and killed his mistress Danielle Ledez and her daughter Stephanie and severely injured Christopher, Ledez's elder child. He went on the run for eight days when he surrendered to authorities in France after threatening to commit suicide by jumping off Amiens Cathedral. Wood was later convicted of double murder, attempted murder and theft. =Upper House= A plaque on the building states that Upper House was the home of the Worrall family from 1540 to 1988 and that the family had lived in Ughill for in excess of 700 years over 25 generations. Other buildings in Ughill include Platts Farm, Nether House, Manor Farm Cottage and Cherry Tree Cottage. Mining The fire brick company Thomas Wragg & Sons owned a Pot Clay mine immediately to the south east of the hamlet. Pot Clay is the impure version of Ganister and was in demand in the Sheffield steel industry to make bricks for the lining of furnaces. In the early 1970s the mine was producing 15,000 tons of clay per year, with the company quoting, “The mine can be worked at the present rate for 100 years”. A refractory brick works stood at the entrance to the mine. However the Ughill mine had drainage problems and although powerful pumps had been installed in the 1950s to pump between 600 and 800 gallons per minute from the mine, the mine closed on 17 November 1977. It had become uneconomic to mine the clay due to water problems and the owners found it more profitable to bring in clay from the Midlands. The site of the mine has been landscaped and returned to agricultural use.\\"The Forgotten Mines of Sheffield\\", Ray Battye, ALD Design & Print, , pages 70, Gives details of mining. J&J; Dyson mined fireclay at their open cast quarry at Wheatshire between Ughill and Sugworth. The quarry is closed but can still be seen from the nearby road. Thos. Wragg had small firebrick works at Load Brook (closed 1957) and Brookside (Stopes Road, Stannington, closed 1960) the former previously owned by the Trickett family, the latter by the Drabble family and a major works (Old Wheel Brick Works) in the nearby Loxley Valley. Wraggs along with its local competitors, J&J; Dyson of Griffs Works, Stannington and Thos. Marshall of Storrs Bridge Works, Loxley, mined the Stannington Pot Clay seam and manufactured fireclay-based casting pit holloware refractories for use in steel making worldwide. All three plants closed following a collapse in demand for casting pit refractories of the type made locally mainly because of the introduction of continuous casting of steel worldwide and the general demise of the British steel industry.
