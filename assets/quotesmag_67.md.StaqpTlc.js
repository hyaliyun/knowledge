It was founded in 1971 and located in the Christchurch Arts Centre from 1976 until the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. It opened new premises in Addington in December 2011. It is currently New Zealand's largest theatre company, and is led by Chief Executive Barbara George and Artistic Director Daniel Pengelly.  History =Founding and early years Canterbury Provincial Council The company was founded by Yvette Bromley and Mervyn Thompson in 1971 who served as Co- artistic Directors for the first three years of the company. Bromley chose the theatre's name out of affection for the Royal Court Theatre in London, which she knew well from her upbringing and drama education. During the first eighteen months of its existence, The Court had three venues. The first was the Stone Chamber of the Canterbury Provincial Council Chambers (April – May 1971), where The Court's début production, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie was staged. Occasionally the Māori Land Court would require the use of the chamber, necessitating the set being struck and taken to the Durham Street Art Gallery; the furniture being moved back into the chamber and the processed reversed for the next evening's performance. The Stone Chamber was one of the city's most magnificent structures, but it was impractical for a theatre company, as there was little room for an audience and a lack of toilets. Next was the Durham Street Art Gallery (June 1971 – May 1972), which was used as an interim venue between the Canterbury Society of Arts vacating the premises and the Law Court expanding into the area. From June to August 1972, The Court was housed in the Beggs Theatrette and staged two productions in the space. The next four years (September 1972 – February 1976) were a period of relative stability. The Court Theatre was housed at The Orange Hall on Worcester Street. In 1974, Mervyn Thompson stood down leaving Yvette Bromley as sole Artistic Director until 1975 when Randall Wackrow (who had joined the company as Business Manager in 1973) joined her as Co-Director. The Arts Centre The Court Theatre at the Christchurch Arts Centre In 1976, the company moved to the Christchurch Arts Centre complex, in the buildings which were formerly the Engineering School of Canterbury College. The performance space was previously lecture room D. From 1977 to 1978, Randall Wackrow served as sole Artistic Director, standing down in 1979 with the appointment of Elric Hooper. Hooper served as Artistic Director for more than two decades. Hooper declared his intent to balance the theatre's repertoire with \\"three main thrusts — the classic, the contemporary and the indigenous\\". Although economic pressure saw a fledgling second auditorium, Court Two, closed as a regular venue following the economic slump of the mid-eighties (although it was to be later revived as The Forge), overall this philosophy was rewarded. The Court expanded its company with the introduction of Theatresports to Australasia in the late 1980s and the formation of professional improvisation troupe, The Court Jesters in 1989. In 1990, Hooper was awarded an MBE and the 1990 Commemoration medal by the Queen. Hooper retired as Artistic Director in 1999 and Catherine Downes served as Artistic Director of The Court Theatre from 2000 to 2005. Ross Gumbley became The Court's Artistic Director in 2006 and helped The Court find a new home in Addington when the 2011 Christchurch earthquake destroyed The Court's Arts Centre home. The Shed, Addington The Court remains in The Shed while planning for a permanent home in the city. In December 2019, Ross Gumbley became The Court's Artistic Adviser/Lead Director, helping to plan for this new future, while Daniel Pengelly took over as Interim Artistic Director. In May 2020, Pengelly was appointed Artistic Director until 31 December 2020. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the Court Theatre's shows were postponed or cancelled. The Court began staging productions in The Shed's foyer with safety measures in place in August 2020 and on 21 September 2020 announced that the main auditorium would be reopening.  Current role and activities  The Court Theatre employs professionals from around the country and internationally. It sustains a full-time professional staff and an ensemble acting company and is administered by The Court Theatre Trust. In addition to being a full-time professional theatre company, The Court Theatre operates numerous other activities in the community. The company annually tours a show regionally around the South Island. Its education programme provides training for school-age students and adults, regularly liaising with high school and tertiary institutions as well as other community groups. The company also produces school holiday kids' shows and an annual touring primary school show. Furthermore, the company employs a troupe of professional improvisors and corporate entertainers, The Court Jesters. The most public face of their work is the improv comedy show \\"Scared Scriptless\\" which is staged every Friday night at 10:15pm.

The species was first described by the scientist Edward Blyth in 1861. This species has two known subspecies, the nominate Bungarus multicinctus multicinctus, and Bungarus multicinctus wanghaotingi. The many-banded krait mostly inhabits marshy areas throughout its geographical distribution, though it does occur in other habitat types. Etymology Since the species' description by zoologist and pharmacist Edward Blyth in 1861, Bungarus multicinctus has been the binomial of the species. The generic name, Bungarus, is a Latinisation of Telugu baṅgāru, \\"krait.\\" The specific name multicinctus is derived from the Latin multi-, combining form of multus, \\"much, many\\", and Latin cinctus, past participle of cingere, \\"to encircle\\"—as in a \\"band\\". The full species name (Bungarus multicinctus) thus literally means \\"many-banded krait\\". The common name \\"krait\\" is from Hindi (करैत karait), which is perhaps ultimately derived from the Sanskrit word (काल kāla), which means \\"black\\". It is also called as \\"கட்டுவிரியன்\\" in Tamil, a common name given to the genus Bungarus. Taxonomy and evolution Specimen after shedding skin The kraits, as they are commonly known, belong to the family Elapidae and the genus Bungarus. The genus is endemic to the continent of Asia. They are morphologically well connected, forming a close-knit and cohesive unit. The genus has 12–13 species who are morphologically distinct from the genus Naja and the Afro-elapids according to McDowell (1987). McDowell stated \\"species diversity is greatest in Africa, but the Asiatic Bungarus and Ophiophagus are each so peculiar in anatomy as to suggest an ancient divergence\\". Others, including Slowinski, believed that the kraits (Bungarus), are part of a clade that clusters with a group including the king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) and oddly enough, with the African mambas (Dendroaspis) on the most-parsimonious tree or with Elapsoidea on the maximum- likelihood tree. This result calls into question the monophyly of cobras and underscores the uncertainty of the homology of the hood spreading behavior in cobras and mambas. The relationships of Dendroaspis, Ophiophagus, and Bungarus differed between the parsimony and likelihood analyses, suggesting that more work is necessary to resolve the relationships of these problematic taxa. McDowell's findings in regard to the sister-group of Bungarus and the sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) family, propose that the kraits might just be a per- mutable clade between the elapidae \\"palatine-erectors\\" and the hydrophiinae \\"palatine draggers\\". Two genera within the subfamily Hydrophiinae in particular, support McDowell's hypothesis. The two genera are Salomonelaps and Loveridgelaps due to many shared characteristics. Mao et al. (1983) showed that this species, Bungarus multicinctus was slightly distinct from the other members of its genus and was immunologically more similar to Laticauda, terrestrial Australian elapids, and true sea snakes than it is to Elapsoidea sundevalli (Sundevall's garter snake), Naja naja (Indan cobra) or two Micrurus species (New World or American coral snakes). Minton (1981), Schwaner et al. and Cadle & Gorman (1981) all suggested similar things to Mao et al. (1983) based on immunological data. The many-banded krait was more similar to the Australian elapids, Laticauda and true sea snakes than they were to numerous elapids they were compared to. Description A many-banded krait found in Taiwan The many-banded krait is a medium to large sized species of snake, averaging in length, with maximum lengths reaching . Its body is slender and moderately compressed. The scales of this species are smooth and glossy, with a noticeably distinct vertebral ridge. The colour of the snake is black to dark bluish-black with approximately 21–30 white or creamy white cross bands along the entire length of its upper body. More banding is seen in longer than average sized specimens. The tail is short and pointed, that is also black in colour with alternating white cross bands, of which there are 7–11. The belly of the snake is usually white in colour, but could be an off white or creamy white. The head is primarily black in colour, is broad and oval in shape, but flat and slightly distinct from the body. The eyes are small and black in colour. The pupils are black in colour, thus making them hardly noticeable as they blend in with the rest of the eyes. This species has large nostrils. The fangs are small, fixed and are located in the anterior of the upper jaw. Juveniles of this species usually have whitish blotches on the lower side of their heads. Scalation Dorsal scales in 15 rows; ventral scales 200–231 in males, 198–227 in females; tail short and tapering; subcaudal scales single (undivided), 43–54 in males, 37–55 in females. Distribution and habitat This species is found throughout Taiwan (including the Archipelagos of Matsu and Kinmen), in the central and southern regions of China (in the provinces of Hainan, Anhui, Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian), Hong Kong, Myanmar (Burma), Laos, and northern Vietnam. It may also be found in Thailand. Specimen found on Tai Mo Shan, Hong Kong Although it can be found in elevations up to about , it is far more commonly found in humid lowland areas, and most often observed in subtropical, marshy regions of its range. It is also frequently found in shrublands, woodlands, agricultural fields, and mangroves, often adjacent to water, such as rivers, streams, rice paddies, and ditches. It may also sometimes be found in villages and suburban areas. It is able to survive in other habitats also. Behaviour and diet Close-up of the head with scalation showing The snake is nocturnal, and may be more defensive at night. It is, however, a timid and placid species of snake. In the daytime, it hides under stones or in holes. The snake appears from April and retreats into hibernation in November. It is considered to be more defensive than the Banded krait (Bungarus fasciatus), thrashing about as it is handled. Unlike other Bungarus species, who are primarily snake-eaters, the many-banded krait usually feeds on fish, but it is also preys on other species of snakes, including members of its own species. This species also feeds on rodents, eels, frogs, and occasionally lizards. The Journal of Medical Virology found gene information (codon usage bias) from bungarus multicinctus and naja atra snakes that matches that of the virus SARS-CoV-2, including genetic information from other animals such as bats (rhinolophus sinicus) suggesting possible animal origins of the virus. Article published January 22, 2020. Source: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmv.25682 Reproduction There is limited information on the reproductive habits of this snake. Like many elapids, many-banded kraits are oviparous. Mating occurs between the months of August and September. Females usually deposit 3–15 eggs, although up to 20 eggs can be produced. The eggs are deposited in late spring or early summer, usually in the month of June. Eggs usually hatch about a month and a half later. The hatchlings are around in length. Venom and toxins The venom of the many-banded krait consists of both pre- and postsynaptic neurotoxins (known as α-bungarotoxins and β-bungarotoxins, among others). By weight, almost half of the protein content of the venom is composed of β-bungarotoxins. The average venom yield from specimens kept on snake farms is about 4.6 mg—19.4 mg per bite. The venom is highly toxic with values of 0.09 mg/kg—0.108 mg/kg SC, 0.113 mg/kg IV and 0.08 mg/kg IP on mice. Based on several studies, the many-banded krait is among the most venomous land snakes in the world. α-Bungarotoxin is important for neuromuscular histology, it is known to bind irreversibly to receptors of the neuromuscular junction, and can be labelled with fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein or the rhodamine dye tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. Clinical symptoms The local symptoms of victims bitten by the many-banded krait are usually neither serious swelling nor pain; the victims merely feel slightly itchy and numb. Systemic symptoms occur, in general, one to six hours after being bitten by this snake. Symptoms may include bilateral ptosis, diplopia, discomfort in the chest, general ache, weak feeling in limbs, ataxia, glossolysis, loss of voice, dysphagia, tunnel vision, and difficulty breathing. In case of serious bite, suppression of breathing may occur, leading to death. Hyponatremia is also seen, but less commonly. Estimated mortality rates associated with untreated bites from this species vary between studies from 25–35% to 70–100%. During the Vietnam War, American soldiers referred to the many-banded krait as the \\"two-step snake,\\" in the mistaken belief that its venom was lethal enough to kill within two steps. The many-banded krait gathered worldwide attention after a juvenile individual bit Joe Slowinski on 11 September 2001 in Myanmar. He died the following day, 29 hours after being bitten.

Life=Kings of Northumbria in the Norse era The first known king of Viking York, Halfdan, was expelled in 877. In c. 883, Symeon of Durham's History of the Kings simply states, \\"Guthred, from a slave, was made king\\", but his History of the Church of Durham gives a longer account. Here he writes that after Halfdan was driven out: > During this time the [Viking] army, and such of the inhabitants as survived, > being without a king, were insecure; whereupon the blessed Cuthbert himself > appeared in a vision to abbot Eadred [of the monastery at Carlisle]...[and] > addressed him in the following words:--\\"Go to the army of the Danes,\\" he > said, \\"and announce to them that you are come as my messenger; and ask where > you can find a lad named Guthred, the son of Hardacnut, whom they sold to a > widow. Having found him, and paid the widow the price of his liberty, let > him be brought forward before the whole aforesaid army; and my will and > pleasure is, that he be elected and appointed king at Oswiesdune, (that is, > Oswin's hill), and let the bracelet be placed upon his right arm.Symeon of > Durham, History of the Church of Durham, Chapter XXVIII. It is not clear whether Guthfrith was a Christian, but his relations with the community of Saint Cuthbert, which was a major force in the former Bernicia, and which had lain outside the influence of Halfdan, whose authority was limited to the former Deira--approximately Yorkshire--were good. He granted much land between the River Tyne and the River Wear to the community. This had once belonged to the Wearmouth-Jarrow monastery, and formed the core lands of the church of Durham. Other lands, at the mouth of the River Tees, Guthred allowed Eadred to purchase for the church.Higham, Northern Counties, pp. 310-311. Symeon recounts that Guthred faced a large invasion by the Scots, which was defeated with the aid of Saint Cuthbert.Symeon of Durham, History of the Church of Durham, Chapters XXVIII-XXIX. Death Guthred died on 24 August 895 (or perhaps 894) and was buried at York Minster.Stenton, pp. 262-263. Æthelweard the historian, whose tenth-century Chronicon is a more reliable source for this period than the later works of Symeon, records that in 895: Cultural depictions=Literature Guthred appears as a character in Bernard Cornwell's The Saxon Stories series, figuring particularly in The Lords of the North (2006). Television He is portrayed by Thure Lindhardt in the TV adaptation, The Last Kingdom.

Zachariewicz was a graduate of the Royal Polytechnic Institute in Vienna, and a professor and rector (1881–1882) of the Lemberg Polytechnic. Life He was born in Lemberg, Austrian Empire (Polish: Lwów, now Lviv, Ukraine) to a Polish family. He graduated from the Vienna University of Technology. As a qualified engineer, he held until 1870 numerous positions in the Austrian State Railways. In 1871, he was proposed the post of director of the newly-established Faculty of Civil Engineering at the Lviv Technical Academy (now Lviv Polytechnic). As a consequence, he returned to Lviv and worked as professor at the academy and was appointed dean of the Faculty of Civil Engineering. Between 1877–1878 and 1881–1882 he served as rector of the Lviv Polytechnic. In 1877, he received Austrian nobility \\"Ritter\\" title (Grade II) with the predicate \\"von Lwigród\\". He designed the main building of the Lemberg Polytechnic as well as a separate building of the Faculty of Chemistry. The main building of the polytechnic, known as the \\"Mother of Polish Technical Universities\\", was designed in the then- fashionable eclectic Neo-Renaissance style and was preceded by a number of journeys across Germany and Austria made by Zachariewicz during which he became familiarized with all the newest innovations relating to the construction of this type of buildings. He also designed numerous public buildings and private residences including the Iași railway station (1869–70), the Czernowitz Synagogue, the Galician Savings Bank in Lviv, Church of Franciscan Sisters in Lviv, Jan Styka's villa, and the Tyszkiewicz Villa in Vilnius. He also carried out the renovation of the Church of the Holy Family in Tarnów as well as controversial renovations of the Church of Our Lady of the Snow in Lviv and the Church of John the Baptist in Lviv. He is the author of the book Zabytki sztuki w Polsce published in 1895. He died in Lemberg and was interred at the Lychakiv Cemetery.

Most were closed in the 1960s but four of them, especially around , were replaced by stations on new sites. 13 stations remain open on the line today, but there have been proposals to reopen stations at Cullompton and Wellington.  Background  The route was opened by the Bristol and Exeter Railway in stages between 1841 and 1844. In 1876 this company was amalgamated with the Great Western Railway which, in turn, was nationalised into British Railways in 1948. It is now owned by Network Rail. Apart from the temporary station at Beam Bridge which was only used for a year, the earliest closures were in the Weston-super-Mare area in order to provide new facilities for the traffic to that town, which was much greater than predicted when the line was planned. The majority of the remaining closures followed Dr Beeching's Reshaping of British Railways report of 1963. The most recent closure was Tiverton Junction, which was replaced by a new station at Tiverton Parkway on a site closer to Junction 27 of the M5 motorway, where the North Devon Relief Road joins it.  Stations = Bristol to Taunton  Long Ashton = The site of Long Ashton station. This station was situated on the climb from Bristol up to Flax Bourton Tunnel. It was in the valley below Long Ashton, at the place where today there is a flyover for the A370 road. It was opened by the Great Western Railway in 1926 Originally named Long Ashton Platform, the suffix was dropped on 23 September 1929, and the station was closed on 6 October 1941. There are no visible remains. The University of Bristol has plans to open a new station at Long Ashton, west of the old station, as part of its Fenswood Farm development. = Flax Bourton = The main station building of 1893 at Flax Bourton as it stands today. A station known as Bourton was opened in 1860 just west of the short tunnel at the summit of the climb from Bristol. It was renamed Flax Bourton on 1 September 1868. A house was provided for the station master on the road side above the cutting in which it was situated, a signal box and a couple of small buildings were on the platform. A new station was built a little to the west of the original station and opened on 2 March 1893 with improved facilities. It was closed to passengers on 2 December 1963. It remained open for goods traffic until the end of the following July, after which a Ministry of Fuel and Power depot remained for another forty years or so, but even the connection to this has now been severed. The house by the road still stands, as does a derelict goods lock-up on the up (eastbound) platform. Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways in their Autumn 2011 newsletter called for the reopening to be considered in the reletting of the Greater Western passenger franchise, and there are some suggestions that the station be used as a transfer point for passengers going to Bristol Airport. The next station open southwards is . = Puxton = The Puxton station signal box has been retained to operate the level crossings here and at nearby Hewish. This station was opened with the railway on 14 June 1841 and was initially named \\"Banwell\\", even though that village was quite some distance from the line. In fact a Sandford and Banwell railway station was opened on 3 August 1869 on the Cheddar Valley Railway and so this one on the main line was renamed \\"Worle\\". The settlement of Worle was, however, better served by a new station on the Weston Loop line when it opened on 1 March 1884 and so the one on the main line was renamed again, now being called \\"Puxton\\". Worle station on the Loop was itself closed on 2 January 1922 and so the main line station was given yet another name, now \\"Puxton and Worle\\". Despite all these names, the station is actually in the small village of St Georges. Puxton was a railhead for the milk trains of the London Co-operative Society, who built a creamery next to the station, which was served by its own private siding. The station finally closed on 6 April 1964, although a new Worle railway station was opened a short distance to the west on 24 September 1990. The original station saw some traffic to temporary sidings in 1970/71 during the construction of the M5 Motorway. The platforms and station master's house can still be seen immediately east of Puxton level crossing, which is still controlled by a Great Western Railway-built signal box. A goods shed was demolished sometime between 2004 and 2008 to make way for new buildings. On the opposite side of the line is an old milk depot that was rail-connected from 1925 to 1966 but is now used by a business that repairs road goods vehicles. The next open station southwards is at . = Worle = This station on the Weston Loop adjacent to Worle Junction, was opened with this new line on 1 March 1884. It closed on 2 January 1922 although the substantial stone building was not demolished until the 1960s and the platforms are still visible beneath the trees that have grown on the site. = Weston Junction = Drawings for Weston Junction Station, by Isambard Kingdom Brunel This was the junction of the branch to Weston, built on the moors 1½ miles from Weston- super-Mare. It served only for passengers changing trains until a booking office was opened in 1850. The station was closed on 1 March 1884 when the new loop line to that town was opened, although the mail train continued to drop mail bags every night; for several years, these were collected by a trolley that ran on the old branch line. The staff cottages, which were built in 1870 alongside the approach road, can still be seen on the south side of the line. = Weston-super-Mare = The first Weston-super-Mare station was a terminus to a branch from Weston Junction. It was replaced by a second station, also a terminus and later known as Locking Road to distinguish it from the third (and current) station. = Bleadon and Uphill = Bleadon & Uphill Station in 1963 A new station was opened in 1871 at the south end of Uphill cutting, midway between that village (on the other side of the hill) and Bleadon. Uphill Junction, the southern end of the Weston Loop, was opened at the other end of the cutting in 1884. The station was unstaffed from 2 November 1959 and finally closed on 5 October 1964. It then became the home of a small railway museum, the star exhibits being ex-Cardiff Railway 0-4-0ST 1338 and a British Railways railbus. The museum has since closed and the exhibits moved to other sites, but the platforms are still there as is the station master's house, albeit with a more modern extension. = Brean Road = This halt at Lympsham on the road to Brean opened on 17 June 1929, closed 2 May 1955. It had wooden platforms. = Brent Knoll = Brent Knoll Station in 1963 This station opened in 1875 in the shadow of a large hill, Brent Knoll, to serve the village of Brent Knoll. The station was host to a GWR camp coach from 1938 to 1939. It closed on 4 January 1971, although for many years the train service had been reduced to one train each per day. The brick-built station master's house can still be seen on the east side of the line. The next station open southwards is . = Dunball = Dunball is the location of a wharf on the River Parrett to the north of Bridgwater, and sidings were provided here at an early date, mainly to handle coal shipped across from Wales. A station was opened where the sidings joined the main line in 1873. The down (southbound) platform was situated opposite the sidings; the up platform was a little further south on the other bank of the King's Sedgemoor Drain, a man-made water course that drains the nearby moors. It also served the villages of Puriton and Pawlett. The station was unstaffed from 6 November 1961 and was closed on 5 October 1964. There are no visible remains. The next open station southwards is . = Durston = 150279, on loan to First Great Western, speeds past the site of Durston station, with a service from Taunton to Cardiff Central The Bristol and Exeter opened its Yeovil Branch Line on 1 October 1853 from a new station situated at the north end of the cutting at Durston Despite the Langport and Castle Cary Railway opening in 1906, which effectively left Durston and on a loop line from Cogload Junction, the station continued to serve the branch. The locomotive turntable was taken out of use on 21 September 1952 and the branch closed on 6 July 1964, with Durston station remaining open only until 5 October 1964. The only remains today are the Station Hotel and the trackbed of the old branch running off across the moors towards . = Creech St Michael Halt = 221136 speeds eastwards past the site of Creech St Michael Halt A branch line, the Chard branch, from Taunton to Chard Central was opened on 19 July 1860. The junction was actually at Creech but no station was provided. A halt was eventually opened to serve Creech St Michael by the Great Western Railway on 13 August 1928, but this was north of the junction so was unable to serve as a junction station. It cost £628 to build. Three years later it had to be rebuilt to allow for the two extra tracks to be laid from Cogload Junction to Taunton, after which the platforms were only available to the relief lines on the outside; trains on the main lines, which were generally running to and from London Paddington, could not call. The station closed on 5 October 1964. There are no visible remains. The next open station southwards is at .  Taunton to Exeter  Norton Fitzwarren = The West Somerset Railway opened on 31 March 1862 from a junction at Norton Fitzwarren, but there was no station here and trains continued the short distance to Taunton railway station. A second branch was added on 8 June 1871 when the first section of the Devon and Somerset Railway was opened to Wiveliscombe. Norton Fitzwarren railway station was finally opened on 1 June 1873 to facilitate the interchange of passengers between the three lines. A new station was opened a little nearer Taunton on 2 December 1931, now with two double-sided platforms to cater for the additional two tracks that ran from Cogload Junction to Norton Fitzwarren. The station has been the scene of several serious accidents. On 11 November 1890 there was a fatal collision due to a signalman's error; the driver misreading signals caused a fatal derailment on 4 November 1940; and a train on fire was brought to a stand after passing the site on 6 July 1978, but several passengers were killed. By this time the station had closed: to passengers from 30 October 1961 and to goods from 6 July 1964. A private siding serving a cider factory was in use for several years but is currently out of use. The only remains visible is the Station Hotel, standing empty on the west side of the line. = Wellington (Somerset) = The goods shed and station site at Wellington A station was opened at Wellington when the line reached the town on 1 May 1843. It was a typical Brunel design but was rebuilt in 1932 when two loop lines were put in. This entailed the platforms being moved back to accommodate the widened lines. These platforms are clearly visible and a goods shed still stands on the east side of the line at the Taunton end of the station, although the station closed on 5 October 1964. Wellington was an important station as it stood at the foot of a steep incline. Banking locomotives were kept here, ready to assist heavy westbound trains up to Whiteball Tunnel. = Beam Bridge = The most short-lived of all the stations on the line, Beam Bridge was opened on 1 May 1843 as a temporary terminus while work was continuing on the Whiteball Tunnel. It was closed exactly one year later when the line was completed to Exeter. Road coaches used what is now the A38 road for that one year to carry passengers from terminating trains to their destinations further west. There are no visible remains, but its location is easily identified as being where the A38 road crosses the railway, although it is now carried over the line on a modern flyover – the road of 1841 is the quiet lane below. = Burlescombe = Burlescombe station in 1963 A station was opened at Burlescombe, a little to the west of Whiteball Tunnel, in 1867. A siding on the west side served the railway's nearby ballast quarry at Westleigh; this siding had originally been a gauge line while the main line was . Both lines were converted at different times to – the main line in 1892 and the quarry line in 1899. The station closed on 5 October 1964. = Sampford Peverell = This station opened at Sampford Peverell on 9 July 1928 with wooden platforms. Loop lines were installed in 1932 to allow slow trains to be moved aside to let fast ones overtake, and new concrete platforms were provided to serve them. The station only saw a few years' use; the original station closed on 5 October 1964, the down loop was removed in 1966 and the up loop and sidings in 1968. The site has since been rebuilt as Tiverton Parkway, which opened on 12 May 1986. = Tiverton Junction = A station known as \\"Tiverton Road\\", was opened with the railway to Exeter on 1 May 1844, although it was actually located at Willand, which was the nearest that the railway came to Tiverton. It was renamed \\"Tiverton Junction\\" on 12 June 1848, when Tiverton railway station, at the end of a branch from the Junction station, opened. A second branch, the Culm Valley Light Railway, opened on 29 May 1876. The station was widened to four tracks in 1932; two new platforms being built facing the new loop lines but the centre tracks were only used for non- stopping trains. Goods traffic was withdrawn on 8 May 1967, the Tiverton branch closed for passengers in 1964 and for freight in June 1967. The Culm Valley line had closed to passengers on 7 September 1963, although the line remained in use for goods trains until 31 October 1975. The Junction station continued to be served by a couple of trains each day for about twenty years but was then closed on 11 May 1986 to be replaced by the better sited Tiverton Parkway. The location is now known as \\"Tiverton Loops\\" and platforms can still be seen alongside the now extended loops; engineers use the remaining sidings on the down side. = Cullompton = Cullompton station as it was in 1984 A station was opened at Cullompton when the railway opened on 1 May 1844. In 1931 the platforms were moved back, the lines were widened to provide two passing loops and a new goods shed and waiting room were constructed. The station closed to passengers on 5 October 1964, but goods traffic continued until 8 May. The site is now occupied by Cullompton Services for the adjacent M5 motorway. There is land allocated for re-opening a station at Cullompton but forecast demand is relatively low and so the proposal is for the longer term. In July 2016 Mid Devon District Council announced that it would spend £40k on engineering design work to test the viability of their concept for a new station. This matched a previous commitment by Taunton Deane Borough Council of £40k and £10k contributions from the town councils of Cullompton and Wellington. Reopening Plans As part of the \\"Devon Metro\\" plans by Devon County Council there would be a station near the location of the old station and could form part of the route. The station is a 'possible' long term proposal. = Hele and Bradninch = The old station building at Hele and Bradninch Originally named \\"Hele\\" when opened on 1 May 1844, from 1867 it was known as Hele and Bradninch A siding to the Hele Paper factory was laid in 1919 and used up to the 1980s. Passenger services were withdrawn on 5 October 1964 but public freight facilities were kept until 17 May 1965. The old Bristol and Exeter Railway signal box was closed on 9 December 1985 when control of the level crossing was transferred to the new panel signal box at Exeter. The station is recognisable today, with the empty signal box still remaining at the north end of the southbound platform, one of the buildings still on the platform, and the goods shed opposite (which is now in use by a motor engineering company). = Silverton = The bridge at the site of Silverton A station opened at Silverton on 1 November 1867. The platforms were staggered, with the up (northbound) platform closer to Tiverton than the down platform. The station was closed to passengers on 5 October 1964. Freight traffic continued until 3 May 1965 but a private siding serving a paper mill, which had been opened on 26 July 1894, was closed on 31 August 1967. = Stoke Canon = 221115 heads south past the signal box at Stoke Canon in 2008 A station opened to serve Stoke Canon in 1860 with staggered platforms. The up platform was north of the level crossing; the down platform was to the south. On 1 May 1885 the Exe Valley Railway was opened from a junction a little to the south of the station. Stoke Canon station was then relocated further south so that it could serve both lines from 2 July 1894. As with most stations on the Taunton to Exeter line, the platforms were moved apart in 1932 to accommodate new loop lines, and the branch was given its own side of the up platform so that trains could run on to the branch while a train stood in the up loop. It was closed to passengers on 13 June 1960 but goods traffic continued until 3 May 1965. The station signal box closed at this time, but the earlier signal box, built by the Bristol and Exeter Railway before 1876, had been retained to operate the level crossing and was not closed until 9 December 1985 when control of the level crossing was transferred to the new panel signal box at , which is the next station southwards.

It opened in 1860, and was closed by the Beeching Axe in 1964.  History = Opening  The first sections of the Bristol and Exeter Railway, those between Bristol and and the branch to , opened on 14 June 1841. The station was first opened in 1860 as Bourton roughly half a mile from the village of Flax Bourton in Somerset. Located in a deep cutting by the B3130 road from Bristol to Nailsea, just west of the short tunnel at the summit of the climb from Bristol, it was from the Great Western Railway terminus at Paddington in London and from the B&E;'s northern terminus at Bristol Temple Meads.Railways in the United Kingdom are, for historical reasons, measured in miles and chains. There are 80 chains to the mile. When it opened it was the first station out of Bristol, taking the claim from , and remained so until opened in 1871. The station was renamed Flax Bourton on 1 September 1888. The line, engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was built as broad gauge. The line had been reconstructed as a mixed gauge line to accommodate local gauge traffic by 1 June 1875, and broad gauge trains ceased operation on 20 May 1892. The original station's main building was at the Bristol (east) end of the eastbound platform, built of wood. A signal box was towards the centre of the platform. The platforms were accessed by paths from both north and south, linked by a timber footbridge on brick pillars. A station master's house was built on the road above the eastbound platform.  Expansion  Due to being in a cutting, expansion of the station was not possible, and when a need for larger facilities arose, a new station was built further west ( from Paddington, from Temple Meads), closer to the village. The new station opened on 2 March 1893, with the old station closing the same day. A large brick building was constructed on the eastbound platform with a large canopy, and a smaller building on the westbound platform. A covered footbridge linked the two platforms. There was a short relief line just east of the station, a siding on the west side led to a goods shed with canopies on both track and road sides, with a signal box adjacent. In 1956/7 the private Tyntesfield Sidings were laid just beyond the B3129 Station Road bridge, to serve a Ministry of Fuel and Power underground fuel depot.  Closure and dilapidation  Inside the waiting room of the main station building. It has been derelict since the 1960s, and is boarded up. Flax Bourton signal box in the 1970s. The station closed to passengers on 2 December 1963, a victim of the Beeching Axe. Goods traffic continued until 1 July 1964, although the private siding continued in use for some time. Of the first station all that remains is the footbridge (although the deck has been replaced with concrete), but it is just possible to make out the old paths down to the platforms. The station master's house is now in residential use. More survives of the second station – the main building and goods shed on the eastbound platform are still in situ, albeit boarded-up and crumbling, at the end of a private residential road. The building on the westbound platform has been demolished, the platforms have been removed and the running lines slewed closer to the remaining station buildings. The relief line to the east has been removed. The fuel sidings were disconnected and the adjacent crossover points removed in February 2004. One of the station buildings was damaged by arson on 7 April 2003.  Services  A First Great Western diesel multiple unit speeds past the remains of the second Flax Bourton railway station in 2008. No trains have stopped at Flax Bourton since 1964, and the platforms have been removed. Services were originally operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway, continuing until the company was subsumed into the Great Western Railway in 1876. When the railways were nationalised under the Transport Act 1947, control passed to the Western Region of British Railways.  Future  The footbridge of the first station is still present, although all other remains have long since been removed. The old Tyntesfield Sidings were considered by the Mineral Industry Research Organisation as a possible railhead for the nearby Tarmac-operated limestone quarry at Stancombe. Such a plan would require a conveyor, crossing the A370 and railway line. Reconnection to rail was listed as \\"feasible\\", but the scheme was not recommended for shortlisting, instead being listed as an \\"other possibility\\". A similar scheme was stopped in 1999 after local protests. The Bristol to Exeter line through Flax Bourton is not currently electrified. The 21st Century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line will see the line from London to Bristol electrified, but electrification will not extend beyond Bristol to . The group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways supports the electrification continuing to Weston, as does MP for Weston-super-Mare John Penrose. Many local travel groups have called for the reopening of Flax Bourton station. Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways in their Autumn 2011 newsletter called for the reopening to be considered in the reletting of the Greater Western passenger franchise. Campaign for Better Transport Bristol/Bath Travel Area submitted a statement to the House of Commons Transport Committee, which was published in 2008's Delivering a Sustainable Railway. In it, they called for the reopening of Flax Bourton railway station to serve Bristol Airport. Railfuture in the South West also called for the reopening as a way to serve the Airport. North Somerset Council also suggested the reopening of Flax Bourton station to help with the sustainability of new housing in the area.

It is a prodrug which is activated non- enzymatically into the active agent dichlorvos. It is used as an insecticide. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency trichlorfon has been used on golf course turf, home lawns, non-food contact areas of food and meat processing plants, ornamental shrubs and plants, and ornamental and baitfish ponds. Used to control caterpillars, white grubs, mole crickets, cattle lice, sod webworms, leaf miners, stink bugs, flies, ants, cockroaches, earwigs, crickets, diving beetle, water scavenger beetle, water boatman backswimmer, water scorpions, giant water bugs and pillbugs. After reregistration, a number of its uses were voluntarily restricted, and currently, it is used in nonfood areas to control flys, roaches, and ants among other pets. Outdoors it is used on ornamental plants, golf courses, and lawn grass to treat lepidopteran larvae pests, it is also used to treat flies in animal husbandry in areas that are not accessible to animals, it also used to control harvester ants. It can be used to treat schistosomiasis (dead link 31 January 2019) caused by Schistoma haematobium, but is no longer commercially available. It has been proposed for use in treatment of Alzheimer's disease, but use for that purpose is not currently recommended. Bans and restrictions In the United States, trichlorfon/metrifonate may only be used on nonfood and nonfeed sites. Trichlorfon/metrifonate was banned in the EU in 2008 (Regulation (EC) 689/2008) and in Brazil in 2010. Trichlorfon/metrifonate was banned in Argentina in 2018, noting that trichlorvon converts to dichlorvos by metabolism in plants, as well as by biodegradation of the soil.

The concert was due to run from 3p.m. until midnight and include performances by Byzantium and others, but wage disputes between the unions and the government had led to frequent power cuts, one of which occurred in the early evening, giving an unusual album track \\"Power cut\\". The fire brigade asked the audience to leave, but when power was resumed, and the audience re-admitted, hundreds more people came in. In defiance of the Fire Brigade, many people stayed inside, temporary lighting was set up, and the audience was entertained by eccentric folk band Skinner's Rats who did not require amplification.

Aquino Sr., was a Filipino politician who served as Speaker of the National Assembly of the Japanese- sponsored puppet state in the Philippines from 1943 to 1944. He was the Director-General of KALIBAPI, a political party established during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. His grandson Benigno S. Aquino III was the 15th President of the Philippines from 2010 to 2016. Early life Benigno \\"Igno\\" Aquino was born in Murcia, now part of Concepcion, Tarlac, to Servillano \\"Mianong\\" Aquino, a general in the Philippine Revolution who later served as a member of the Malolos Congress, and Guadalupe Quiambao. He had two siblings: Gonzalo Aquino (born 1893) and Amando Aquino (born 1896), and a half-brother, Herminio Aquino (born 1949). He studied at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran in Manila and later at the University of Santo Tomas, where he earned his law degree in 1913, and was admitted to the bar the following year. Political career Aquino was first elected to the Philippine Legislature (as a member of the Philippine House of Representatives) in 1919 representing the 2nd District of Tarlac. He was reelected to the same position in 1922 and 1925 before winning a Philippine Senate seat in 1928 representing the 3rd Senatorial District comprising the provinces of Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga and his home-province of Tarlac. He became part of the Philippine Independence Mission in 1931, which negotiated the terms of obtaining Philippine independence from the United States. During the elections for the Commonwealth of the Philippines government in 1935 he ran again in his district in Tarlac and won. In 1937, he was appointed by Commonwealth President Manuel L. Quezon as Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce. Speaker of the National Assembly Being among the more prominent Commonwealth officials remaining in the country after the Commonwealth government went into exile in 1941, Aquino was among those recruited by the Japanese to form a government. He became the director-general of KALIBAPI and one of the two assistant chairmen of the Preparatory Commission for Philippine Independence. When the Second Philippine Republic was inaugurated, he was elected Speaker of the National Assembly. Arrest and collaboration charges Aquino (center) with Laurel (left) in 1945. In December 1944, as the combined Filipino and American forces continued their advance to liberate the Philippines from Japanese forces, the government of the Second Philippine Republic, which included Aquino, was moved to Baguio. Subsequently it was flown to Japan where, together with other officials, its members were arrested and imprisoned at the Sugamo Prison when the Japanese surrendered. On August 25, 1946, Aquino was flown back to the Philippines for his trial on treason charges by the People's Court; a few weeks later he was released on bail. Personal life=First marriage In May 1916, he married Maria Urquico, the daughter of katipunero Antonio Urquico and Justa Valeriano.

Biosynthesis  Biosynthesis of Radicicol has been best studied in Pochonia chlamydosporia, in which the majority of the core structure is produced in vivo through iterative type I polyketide synthases. This structure produced is the earliest intermediate in the radicicol biosynthesis, monocillin II. This intermediate is transformed to radicicol through halogenation and epoxide formation performed by RadH and RadP respectively.

It was previously regarded as member of the Australo-Pacific honeyeaters (Meliphagidae). Description Moho apicalis and Chaetoptila angustipluma The males reached a length of 30.5 centimeters. The wing length was 10.5 to 11.4 centimeters, the culmen was between 3.5 and 3.8 centimetres and the tarsus was between 3.4 and 3.8 centimeters. The females were smaller. The plumage was predominantly sooty black. The tail feathers were brown and had, with the exception of the two central tail feathers, white tips. Further characteristics were the white feather tufts under the axillaries and the two narrow central tail feathers which changed into fine hair-like or fibrous tips. The flanks and the undertail coverts were colored deeply yellow. The bill and the tarsus were black. Its biology is not well-studied. Occurrence and habitat Its habitat was the mountain forests on O‘ahu. Extinction The O‘ahu ‘ō‘ō was first mentioned by Andrew Bloxam. While in the Hawaiian Islands in 1825 as the naturalist on board HMS Blonde, he saw live birds which were brought to him by locals. He preserved one specimen obtained in this way. He wrote in his diary (not published until much later): \\"They are now very scarce in all the islands. I did not see even one in the different excursions I made, & the natives asked a high price for the very few they brought to me.\\" Bloxam misidentified his birds as the species now called Moho nobilis., pp.13-14 John Gould scientifically named and described the O‘ahu ‘ō‘ō in 1860, when it was already regarded as vanished for 23 years. The last reliable evidence was a collection of about three birds by German naturalist Ferdinand Deppe in 1837. He found these specimens in the hills behind the capital, Honolulu. After surveys, led by ornithologist Robert C. L. Perkins and others, failed to find the bird between 1880 and 1890, it was described as almost extinct. Today there are seven specimens in museum collections in Berlin, London, New York City and Cambridge (Massachusetts). The reasons for its extinction were probably avian diseases caused by introduced mosquitos, habitat destruction by cattle and goats, deforestation, predation by introduced rats, and hunting (their plumage was used in robes for the Hawaiian nobility).

The play is in two acts. The story concerns an eccentric woman who lives in Paris and her struggles against the straitlaced authority figures in her life. The original production was done with Giraudoux's frequent collaborator, actor and theater director Louis Jouvet, who played the Ragpicker. The celebrated French actress Marguerite Moreno was the inspiration for the piece. The play has frequently been revived in France, with the title role played by Edwige Feuillère, Madeleine Robinson, or Judith Magre. Plot summary The play is set in the cafe \\"chez Francis\\" in the Place de l'AlmaLa Folle de Chaillot, Editions Bernard Grasset, Paris, 1946, p. 13 in the Chaillot district of Paris. A group of corrupt corporate executives are meeting. They include the Prospector, the President, the Broker and the Baron, and they are planning to dig up Paris to get at the oil which they believe lies beneath its streets. Their nefarious plans come to the attention of Countess Aurelia, the benignly eccentric madwoman of the title. She is an aging idealist who sees the world as happy and beautiful. But, advised by her associate, the Ragpicker, who is a bit more worldly than the Countess, she soon comes to realize that the world might well be ruined by these evil men—men who seek only wealth and power. These people have taken over Paris. \\"They run everything, they corrupt everything,\\" says the Ragpicker. Already things have gotten so bad that the pigeons do not bother to fly any more. One of the businessmen says in all seriousness, \\"What would you rather have in your backyard: an almond tree or an oil well?\\" Aurelia resolves to fight back and rescue humanity from the scheming and corrupt developers. She enlists the help of her fellow outcasts: the Street Singer, The Ragpicker, The Sewer Man, The Flower Girl, The Sergeant, and various other oddballs and dreamers. These include her fellow madwomen: the acidic Constance, the girlish Gabrielle, and the ethereal Josephine. In a tea party every bit as mad as a scene from Alice in Wonderland, they put the \\"wreckers of the world's joy\\" on trial and in the end condemn them to banishment—or perhaps, death.

He was highly critical of the communist regime. Biography Valery was born in Kyiv in 1906 and graduated from the Rostov-on-Don State University in 1929. He translated thirty four books into Russian. During World War II Tarsis was twice severely wounded. As a young man Tarsis joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union but became disillusioned in the 1930s and finally broke with the party in 1960. In 1966, he said his key purpose in writing \\"is to struggle against Communism.\\" He smuggled his compositions out of Russia so that they could escape Soviet censorship. The publication abroad of his scathing 1962 novel The Bluebottle earned him an eight-month stay in a Soviet mental hospital, an experience he described in his autobiographical novel Ward 7: \\"All around him were faces exposed by sleep or distorted by nightmares ... it is always hard to be the only one awake, and it is almost unbearable to stand the third watch of the world in a madhouse...\\" Tarsis' Ward No. 7 is a personal account of the use of psychiatry to stifle dissidence. The book was one of the first literary works to deal with political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union. Tarsis based the book upon his own experiences in 1963–1964 when he was detained in the Moscow Kashchenko psychiatric hospital for political reasons. In a parallel with the story Ward No. 6 by Anton Chekhov, Tarsis implies that it is the doctors who are mad, whereas the patients are completely sane, although unsuited to a life of slavery. In ward No. 7 individuals are not cured, but persistently maimed; the hospital is a jail and the doctors are gaolers and police spies. Most doctors know nothing about psychiatry, but make diagnoses arbitrarily and give all patients the same medication — the anti-psychotic drug aminozin or an algogenic injection. Tarsis denounces Soviet psychiatry as pseudo-science and charlatanism. Among all the victims of Soviet psychiatry, Tarsis was the sole exception in the sense that he did not emphasised the 'injustice' of confining 'sane dissidents' to psychiatric hospitals and did not thereby imply that the psychiatric confinement of 'insane patients' was proper and just. In 1966, Tarsis was permitted to emigrate to the West, and was soon deprived of his Soviet citizenship. He lectured at the Leicester University and Gettysburg College. In his words, he had invitations to lecture at the Sorbonne and at universities of Geneva, Oslo and Naples. The KGB had plans to compromise the literary career of Tarsis abroad through labelling him as a mentally ill person. As the 1966 memorandum to the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union reported, \\"KGB continues arrangements for further compromising Tarsis abroad as a mentally ill person.\\" He settled in Bern, Switzerland where he died after a heart attack on 3 March 1983 at the age of 76.

The species epithet \\"albitrunca\\" refers to the oftentimes white trunk. Traditionally, the shepherd tree was used by Dutch settlers, \\"boers\\", to create a variant of coffee that is derived from the roots of the tree. It is an evergreen tree native to southern and tropical Africa, living in the hot, dry, and often brackish low-lying areas, sometimes on abundant lime or occasionally found in rocky terrain. It is a common tree of the Kalahari, bushveld and lowveld. It is one of the most important forage trees in the Kalahari. A shepherd's tree in Botswana with characteristic white bark Description This tree grows up to tall but is usually much smaller. It has a prominent, sturdy white trunk frequently with strips of rough, dark-coloured bark. The crown is often browsed by antelope and all grazers that can reach the foliage, resulting in a conspicuous flattened underside or browse-line. The leaves are narrow, oblanceolate, and stiff with veins obscure except for the distinct midrib. The flowers are small, greenish-yellow, star-shaped, and clustered. The fruits, on a jointed stalk, are about in diameter and are brittle-skinned with a whitish flesh and large endocarp. A specimen found in the central Kalahari in 1974 had roots extending to deep, making it the plant with the deepest known roots. Relationships Boscia belongs to the caper family Capparaceae. Pickled capers are made from the unopened buds of European members of this family. Boscia albitrunca is closely related to Boscia foetida subsp. rehmanniana, which has much smaller leaves and velvet-textured fruits. The genus was named for Louis Bosc (1759–1828), a French professor of agriculture who lived through the revolution.

Today, the term \\"coaling station\\" can also refer to coal storage and feeding units in fossil-fuel power stations.  History  Initially named a coaling station due to the use of coal for steam generation a fuelling station was built for the purpose of replenishing coal supplies for ships or railway locomotives. The term is often associated with 19th and early 20th century seaports associated with blue water navies, who used coaling stations as a means of extending the range of warships. In the late 19th century steamships powered by coal began to replace sailing ships as the principal means of propulsion for ocean transport. Fueling stations transitioned to oil as boilers moved from being coal-fired to oil- or hybrid oil-and-coal-firing, coal being completely replaced as steam engines gave way to internal combustionEncyclopædia Britannica, Fourteenth Edition, Volume Pg 899, 1938 and gas turbine power plants. Naval fuelling stations Pearl Harbor with fuel tanks in the foreground, in 1919. Countries with large naval forces must maintain means for fueling their fleets in times of conflict, to this end defended fueling stations were set up around theaters of operations. Examples of such fuelling stations were almost any of the principal ports of the British Isles, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, British Africa, or India. In addition, there were facilities for coaling vessels at St. Helena, Ascension, and the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic; at Jamaica and Bermuda in the North Atlantic, at Gibraltar, Malta, and Port Said in the Mediterranean; at Aden, on the Gulf of Aden; at Colombo in Ceylon (Sri Lanka); at Singapore; and at Labuan in the China Sea; at Hong Kong on the Chinese coast; at Chagos, Seychelles, or Mauritius in the Indian Ocean; at Thursday Island and Suva, Fiji, in the South Pacific: (British) and at Honolulu, Pago Pago and Manila in the Pacific for the United States.Encyclopædia Britannica, Fourteenth Edition, Volume Pg 899, 1938 While defense of naval fuelling stations has historically focused on attack by other naval powers Global security website the USS Cole bombing in the Yemeni port of Aden in October 2000 has focused attention on the importance of ship defense during refueling operations even in friendly fueling stations. Commercial fuelling stations As international trade grew a defined set of fixed routes, sea lanes were established with fuelling stations appearing at strategic points along these routes. Since most fuelling stations did not possess natural resources in coal or oil the “bunkering” trade of transporting coal and oil to fueling stations consumed a considerable portion of shipping tonnage.Encyclopædia Britannica, Fourteenth Edition, Volume Pg 899, 1938 As shipbuilding progressed to ever-larger ships, additional fuel storage capacity was incorporated into ship design that afforded greater range between refueling stops. Today most oceangoing vessels have the ability to fuel for an uninterrupted ocean crossing at their terminal locations before setting to sea.

In 1996, Sanches graduated Nederland High School in Texas where he played baseball, basketball, football, and ran track. Sanches attended Lamar University in Texas where he played for the Lamar Cardinals Baseball team. Career=Kansas City Royals He was first drafted by the Kansas City Royals as a 2nd round pick in the 1999 Major League Baseball Draft and later signed with them on July 6, 1999. Sanches made his professional debut in 1999 with Single-A Spokane. While there, he struck out a career-high 11 batters in 6.0 innings pitched on August 27, 1999 versus Boise. He pitched a no-hitter on May 2, 2000 for the Single-A Wilmington Blue Rocks versus the Lynchburg Hillcats. Sanches spent the 2001 season with the Double-A Wichita Wranglers. While playing with Wichita during the 2002 season, he notched 10 wins. From July 1 to August 1, he won 4 consecutive decisions. In 2003, Sanches went 1-0 with an ERA of 1.83 with the Wranglers. Later that year, Brian (along with Chris Tierney) was traded to the San Diego Padres for Rondell White. Philadelphia Phillies Sanches was then traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in 2004. He pitched for Reading (Double-A) during 2004 while posting a 1.98 ERA. He earned Minor League Player of the Week honors from June 28 to July 4. Sanches was promoted on August 26 to Triple-A Scranton, where he finished the season. He pitched the entire 2005 season for Scranton while holding left-handers to a .212 average and allowing just one home run in his first 29.0 innings pitched. Sanches was a non-roster invitee to spring training. He began the season with Scranton, but finally made his major league debut on June 1, 2006, pitching 2.0 innings and giving up one walk and three strike-outs. Sanches was shuffled to and from the majors during the rest of the season. After Francisco Rosario was placed on the 15-day DL, Sanches was recalled from Ottawa on June 17, 2007. Washington Nationals He signed as a free agent with the Washington Nationals on December 21, 2007. He appeared in 12 games with the Nationals in 2008, with a 7.36 ERA. Florida Marlins In November 2008, he signed with the Florida Marlins.Sanches to Fish In three seasons with the Marlins, he pitched in 147 games with a 10-5 record and 2.92 ERA. Second stint with the Philadelphia Phillies He signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies on November 30, 2011. After opening the season with the AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigs, he was placed on the Phillies' active roster on May 1 following the injury of reliever David Herndon. He posted a 0–1 record and 11.25 ERA in 3 games before returning to the IronPigs ten days later. On June 28, Sanches was called back up by the Phillies along with Jeremy Horst, to replace Chad Qualls, who was designated for assignment. He was outrighted to Triple-A on July 17. On July 31, Sanches was released by the organization. Houston Astros On August 2, 2012 Sanches made an agreement to join the Houston Astros organization with Triple-A Oklahoma City. Return to Royals The Kansas City Royals announced on November 16, 2012 that they had signed Sanches to a minor-league contract for 2013. No financial terms of the deal were revealed. Pitching style Sanches relies mostly on four pitches. His primary pitch is a four-seam fastball in the upper 80s, which he uses for about half his pitches. Against left-handed hitters, he relies heavily on a forkball and somewhat less on a two-seam fastball to round out his repertoire. Against right-handed hitters, Sanches uses a slider as his main off-speed pitch, and he also throws the forkball to righties. On rare occasions, Sanches throws a mid-90s curveball.

He was a three-quarter for the Australian national team. He played in three Tests in 1946, two as captain. Club career Born in Berry, New South Wales of Norwegian descent, he started playing rugby league after he left school at 16. In 1939 he played with the Port Kembla club in the Wollongong competition. He missed the 1940 season through illness but returned in 1941 in which he year he debuted in country and New South Wales representative sides. In 1944 he joined the Balmain club in Sydney and scored over 100 points assisting the side to a premiership win. They were runners up to Easts in 1945 and triumphant again in 1946 with Jorgenson scoring two tries in the premiership decider against St George. In 1947 after having played the regular season in the Maher Cup as captain coach of Junee, Jorgenson returned to Balmain lower grades for the finals and in the Grand Final against Canterbury made his sole first grade appearance for the year. After the regular kicker Pat Devery missed three attempts, Jorgenson took over and scored all of the team's points in the 13-9 victory comeback after trailing 0-9. Victorious he was chaired from the field by his team-mates. Jorgenson in all had a nine-year career with Balmain playing 98 games and scoring 734 points. Jorgenson finished his career with Parramatta in 1954 and made 5 appearances in his one season at the club in which they finished last on the table. Goal kicking pioneer At the time goalkickers tended to stand the ball up in a divot in the ground made with the player's boot heel. Whilst some kickers experimented with laying the ball down, Jorgenson introduced the idea of laying the ball on a mound of dirt and kicking toe first with a straight follow through. He had enormous success with this new method and some statistics include: * 25 goals in the four NSW v Queensland interstate games of 1945-46 * 8 goals from 9 attempts in the muddy interstate game at the Sydney Cricket Ground May 1945. Representative career In 1945 and 46 he was a regular in state representative sides and captained New South Wales in the fixtures of 1946 against Queensland and against the visiting British Lions. Jorgenson was then selected for and made captain of the Australian Test side of 1946 for the first post-World War II Ashes series. He was captain for the 1st and 3rd tests of the series with Ron Bailey captain in the 2nd test. The selectors felt that the captaincy pressure affected Jorgenson's kicking style, a possibility supported by the fact that he landed only one goal in the first Test from six attempts. He is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 225.ARL Annual Report 2005, page 53 He did not represent at state or national level again. He died on 7 May 1993.Sydney Morning Herald- Death Notice - 12/05/1993 ReferencesSources * Whiticker, Alan (2004) Captaining the Kangaroos, New Holland, Sydney Category:1921 births Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Australian people of Danish descent Category:Australia national rugby league team players Category:Australia national rugby league team captains Category:Balmain Tigers players Category:Parramatta Eels players Category:New South Wales rugby league team players Category:City New South Wales rugby league team players Category:Country New South Wales rugby league team players Category:1993 deaths Category:Rugby league centres ","title":"Joe Jorgenson"},{"id":"10870643","text":"Eberndorf (, archaically Dobrla ves) is a market town of the Völkermarkt District in Carinthia, Austria.

The municipal area includes the Katastralgemeinden Buchbrunn (Bukovje), Gablern (Lovanke), Gösselsdorf (Goselna vas), Kühnsdorf (Sinča vas), Loibegg (Belovče), Mittlern (Metlova), Mökriach (Mokrije) and Pribelsdorf (Priblja vas). At the 2001 census 8.6% of the population were Carinthian Slovenes. History Eberndorf Abbey: gate and parish church In the late 11th century the Aribonid count Kazelin (Chazelinus) founded Eberndorf Abbey within the Duchy of Carinthia. Patriarch Ulrich von Aquileia confirmed the establishment in an 1106 deed concerning the translation of the count's mortal remains to the newly built monastery church. In the mid 12th century, Patriarch Pilgrim of Aquileia had the premises enlarged as a Canons Regular community. From 1473, the buildings were devastated by Ottoman incursions and a fire, the reconstruction was supervised by Provost Leonhard von Keutschach, the later Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. In the course of the Counter-Reformation, the Augustinian community was dissolved by Pope Clement VIII in 1604. The Habsburg archduke Ferdinand II, ruler of the Inner Austrian lands, had urged him to install a Jesuit residence here. The monastery was secularised after the suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773. In 1809 it was dedicated to the Benedictine St. Paul's Abbey in the Lavanttal. The present-day municipality was established after the 1848 revolutions. The villages of Globasnitz, Rückersdorf and Sittersdorf were split off in 1876. A narrow gauge railway line leading from Völkermarkt via Eberndorf to Eisenkappel opened in 1902, it was dismantled in 1971. The municipality received market rights in 1952.

The bishops met together (many for the first time), held multiple sessions and presentations, and issued two statements, specifically on evangelism and on the notion of American Orthodox Christians being a \\"diaspora.\\" It was not strictly a council or synod per se, but it had many of the characteristics of a synod, particularly the conciliarity or sobornost which results in the meeting of the Church's bishops together in collegiality, referring to itself as an \\"episcopal assembly.\\" The conference was presided over by Archbishop Iakovos (Coucouzis) of America, primate of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America and SCOBA chairman. History=Preparation The original idea for the meeting at Ligonier was generated in the Holy Synod of the Orthodox Church in America some years prior to the invitation by SCOBA, according to Archbishop Nathaniel (Popp) of Detroit: :The proposal was decided that the Orthodox Church in America, the Autocephalous Church, should issue an invitation to all hierarchs in North America to gather together in fellowship in order to come to know one another, face to face. Included would be even those who were not represented on SCOBA, meaning, at that time, the large Ukrainian Church. :What transpired is a matter of historical facts and chance. Some of the hierarchs considered that the forthcoming Millennium Celebration of the Evangelization of Rus should take precedence over this local meeting, and thus, an invitation from the Orthodox Church in America was postponed. On another occasion, the Holy Synod resurrected the same idea but a particular hierarch, not a member of the Orthodox Church in America, requested that an agenda was first necessary and so, the meeting was postponed for lack of a more defined purpose beyond the hierarchs getting to know one another and have general discussion about common problems and needs. :Thus it came to be that, to its credit, the invitation came from the SCOBA which, through its efforts organized and brought about this meeting in Ligonier. Only hierarchs who had representation in SCOBA were invited, and thus the informal gathering envisioned by the Orthodox Church in America came to be a more formal meeting of those hierarchs who were in mutual \\"canonical\\" communion with each other. Thus, some of the hierarchs now represented in SCOBA were not then present for the meeting. At Ligonier In November 1994, the invited hierarchs assembled at the Antiochian Village in Ligonier, Pennsylvania, hosted by Metropolitan Phillip of the Antiochian Archdiocese and presided over by Archbishop Iakovos (Coucouzis) of America, primate at that time of the Greek Archdiocese and SCOBA chairman (by custom, the chairman of SCOBA is elected by its members, but the one elected is always the primate of the representative of the Church of Constantinople in America). Five months before, Metropolitan Spyridon Papageorge of Italy gave a speech at the 32nd Biennial Clergy-Laity Conference of the Greek Archdiocese, in which he plainly stated that both he and the Ecumenical Patriarch, Bartholomew, wanted an end to \\"ethnic ghettoes\\" which divided Orthodoxy in America. He denounced ethnic insularity at the expense of \\"our spiritual identity,\\" and that it was time to cut the \\"Gordian knot of nationalism.\\" Spyridon was generally regarded at the time to be the natural successor to the aged Iakovos, and his bold words for unity seemed the perfect cue for what transpired at Ligonier (Michalopoulos and Ham, 180-181). Though Iakovos officially presided over the event, he \\"graciously receded into the background as Ligonier was under the jurisdiction of Metropolitan Philip, who was thus the host and official prime mover behind the conference.\\" Philip gave the address to the gathered bishops, and Archbishop Dmitri (Royster) of Dallas gave the official response. \\"By all accounts, unity and amity of purpose abounded. The assembled bishops came to an agreement and issued a statement declaring their intention of forming a united American Orthodox Church\\" (ibid., 181). Aftermath The documents which were issued by the conference did not include negative language regarding the old world patriarchates. Indeed, they were mentioned quite positively in the context of the origins of the immigrant churches on American soil. There was close attention to canonical protocol, and no declaration to form a separate religious denomination was attempted, nor was there a declaration of the formation of an autocephalous American Orthodox Church. The meeting can be quite fairly described as simply a gathering of Orthodox bishops in America, thinking and speaking together with one voice on the canonical problems facing their ministry in America. Michalopoulos and Ham continue: :Unfortunately, the Ligonier Statement was viewed by some of the patriarchates as a \\"power grab\\" by Iakovos, who heretofore had been accused sotto voce of cultivating a \\"cult of personality.\\" Many feared that he was on the verge of having himself proclaimed as \\"Patriarch of America.\\" Some of the Old World patriarchates were scared of losing their American dioceses simply for economic reasons. :One of the signatories, Metropolitan Christopher of the Serbian exarchate, openly admitted that the ultimate goal of the Ligonier conference was not only unification, but also autocephaly. The fact that this interview (as well as Christopher's comments) was conducted on videotape and was distributed to parishes all over North America showed there was no hidden agenda at Ligonier. Regardless, Ligonier disturbed not only the Old World patriarchates, but some priests and laymen in America as well. More than a few were perfectly happy with the status quo. (ibid., 181) What is clear from the reports and documents of the conference, however, is that there was no agenda to force a submission of some American Orthodox to others. The senior hierarchs all had something to lose from unification, whether it was property, prestige, revenue, seminaries, orphanages, and so on. The focus was not on \\"pecking order,\\" as The American Orthodox Church puts it, but on \\"the canonical irregularities that plagued American Orthodoxy\\" (ibid., 182). In any event, if any of the \\"big three\\" hierarchs--Iakovos (GOA), Theodosius (OCA) or Philip (AOA)--had been elected as the American Orthodox primate, the reign would have been a short one. All three were old men (two have since retired). None of these three men could have been an \\"empire builder,\\" but rather only a \\"transitional figure\\" (ibid., 182). There was no attempt to make such a move, however. The American Orthodox Church characterizes the move for unity at Ligonier to have ended up a failure: :What began as a sincere plea for an end to disunity eventually accomplished exactly the opposite. Why did it fail? Clearly, the view that this was a power grab by Iakovos played some part. It is believed that one of the signatories of the Ligonier Statement, Bishop Vsevolod of the Ukrainian archdiocese, told Bartholomew that Iakovos was getting ready to have himself declared \\"Patriarch of America.\\" Although the goal of unity had been openly declared as desirable in Spyridon's earlier address to the Greek archdiocese, the inflammatory reportage of the Ligonier Conference by this particular conferee may have caused Bartholomew to question the motives of its signatories. It is just as possible that other forces, which had no desire to see a united Orthodox witness in the United States, were at work behind the scenes. (ibid., 183) The death-knell for the accomplishment of Ligonier seemed to sound in the subsequent removal of Iakovos from his see. It could be that Bartholomew \\"feared the loss of financial support from America,\\" that he \\"feared the loss of American political clout in facing the Turks,\\" or that it perhaps was \\"nothing more than a power struggle between two strong men\\" (ibid., 184). No matter the reasoning, in 1997, the patriarch sent a delegation from the Holy Synod of the Church of Constantinople which forced Iakovos to resign after a nearly 40-year tenure. \\"Despite missteps along the way, to the fullest extent possible, Iakovos bridged ethnic divisions and forged an Orthodox consensus. He almost succeeded in creating the American Orthodox Church\\" (ibid., 184). Not all commentators view Ligonier as a failure, however. Certainly, many of the hierarchs who met one another now know something of their brothers in the episcopacy, and that cannot be undone. Additionally, the very idea of what happened at Ligonier continues on in the consciousness of American Orthodoxy. It may eventually be that Ligonier will be seen not as a failure of unity, but one step along the way toward its pursuit. Archbishop Nathaniel (Popp) of Detroit has this to say: :Ligonier nailed open the doors of indifference and urged us to go through the wide gates of cooperation, mutual support and service to our fellow citizens, sharing the faith with others and spiritually expanding our own lives in evangelical ministry to all God’s people. :Let us now hear about the fruits which bear witness to the blessings generated by Ligonier in the Church, and let us be open to be inspired to expand our witness to the unity of the faith and our fellowship in the Holy Spirit. Documents Two statement documents were issued at Ligonier, one on the Orthodox Church in North America and one on Missions and Evangelism. Their content may generally be characterized as a rejection of the notion that Orthodox Christianity in America constitutes a diaspora, that the ongoing uncanonical disunity of American Orthodoxy must come to an end. Additionally, the statement on evangelism makes it clear that American Orthodox bishops regard the purpose of the Church in America as a missionary one. *Statement on the Church in North America *Statement on Mission and Evangelism Participating hierarchs The following hierarchs signed the documents of the Ligonier Meeting, with one exception noted. The list reflects the titles of these bishops at the time.

Ligonier provided a venue where Orthodox bishops offered words and visions of ecclesial unity. Ten years ago, the prophetic spirit of Ligonier stood opposed to jurisdictional pluralism even when other hierarchs, here and abroad, sought to justify the uncanonical status quo. Ten years ago, the bishops of Ligonier expressed a oneness of mind which exposed the falsehood that jurisdictional pluralism does not impede Eucharistic unity when, in fact, the presence of two or more bishops in one city undermines the very reality of ecclesial and, therefore, Eucharistic unity. :Over the last ten years, the national and international stages have drastically changed. People across North America and the world are divided by religion, race, politics and economics. A divided world needs the unifying voice of Christ. But the voice of Christ, if it is to properly convey its healing power, demands the unity of His Church here and across the globe. The work begun ten years ago must continue and be brought to fruition. As long as there are those who hear and do the word of the Lord in North America, the message of Ligonier will not be silenced. Metropolitan Philip (Saliba) of New York, primate of the Antiochian Archdiocese: :November 30 to December 2, 1994 was the brightest moment in the history of Orthodoxy in North America. For the first time, twenty-nine Orthodox bishops from the United States and Canada gathered at the Antiochian Village to pray together, discuss Orthodox problems together and formulate a common vision for the future. This brotherly and well-meaning meeting caused an unexpected earthquake in some of the ancient Orthodox Patriarchates. Let us hope that the spirit of Ligonier will be born again and our dream for a united Orthodoxy in America will never fade away. Metropolitan Nicholas (Smisko) of Amissos, bishop of the American Carpatho- Russian Orthodox Diocese: :America needs Orthodoxy, without Orthodoxy becoming Americanized. Orthodoxy must continue to develop in spirituality and maturity, growing gradually and appropriately toward a developed polity. I am concerned that aggressive attempts toward premature separation from the mother churches of the old lands will result in disarray and schism. Instead, we are called by the Lord to continue in humble growth and obedience to our organic link with the Patriarchates. We hope and pray for the direction of the Holy Spirit in the future life of our church. Metropolitan Joseph, Bulgarian Eastern Orthodox Diocese of the USA, Canada and Australia: :What we--the canonical Orthodox bishops--had done 10 years ago was good. But there are no results so far. It is only a good desire. That means--such is God’s will. Without Him we can do nothing. :Therefore, I beseeched the Lord to teach me His statutes. After my prayer as usual I opened my Bible with closed eyes and put my finger on the right place. For the first time I opened Revelation 1:3--\\"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.\\" I asked the Lord: \\"O Lord! What about until then?\\" And again I opened the Bible, that time on 1 Timothy 1:15--\\"This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.\\" And for the third time I tempted the Lord, saying: \\"O Lord! I am not an Abraham nor a Jew, I'm a sinner, but involve me to understand Your Will.\\" And then I opened the Book of Sirah--Joshua 24:29-30, where I read in the new American Translation: \\"Said to myself, I will water my plants, my flower bed I will drench; and suddenly this rivulet of mine became a river, then this stream of mine, a sea. Thus do I send my teaching forth shining like a dawn, to become known afar off. Thus do I pour out instruction like prophecy and bestow it on generations to come.\\" :And now it is clear for me, that this prophecy should be fulfilled, but not during my life. I think that all of us, Orthodox bishops, who were born and came to America from the old countries, like me, and now control the jurisdictional eparchies, must die. The Holy Orthodox Church needs new generations of Americans to come after us, who shall fulfill the Lord's instructions and prophecy. Because now, as Fr. Vladimir Berzonsky writes: \\"Spiritually we are still drinking mother's milk, not yet ready for loftier and deeper experiences of the life reaching out to us from Christ and present through the Holy Spirit within our hearts.\\" Other bishops Archbishop Kyrill (Yonchev) of Pittsburgh, OCA: :The meeting in Ligonier of Orthodox hierarchs in North America in November 1994 was extremely encouraging and positive in its decision-making. It concluded that there was need for canonical unity in America among the Orthodox jurisdictions. The gathering offered great hope for the unity of Orthodoxy in America. My vision for the future remains the same--One United Canonical Church in the Americas. Metropolitan Maximos (Aghiorgoussis) of Pittsburgh, Greek Archdiocese: :Congratulations on the November, 2004 The WORD issue, commemorating the 10th Anniversary of the Ligonier meeting of our Orthodox North American Bishops. Unfortunately, things have not drastically changed since that time. We still hope and pray for complete and visible unity in the Orthodox Diaspora of North America. Let us hope that, as promised to us in Washington, D.C., fourteen years ago, the ranking Orthodox jurisdiction, the Ecumenical Patriarchate, will assume a leadership role in order for this to happen, hopefully during our lifetime. Archbishop Peter (L'Huillier) of New York, OCA: :The Ligonier meeting of the Orthodox bishops in North America was a milestone in the history of Orthodoxy in America. The vision of Orthodoxy that was seen at that meeting is still relevant today, but has yet to be realized. Orthodox jurisdictional unity in North America must be our continued vision; any deviation from this is a contradiction to the order and canons of the Orthodox Church. Let us fervently pray that the Holy Spirit will guide us in making this vision a reality. Bishop Nikolai (Soraich) of Sitka, OCA: :The Conference at Ligonier was an exciting moment for many of us who were priests serving the faithful at that time. All who read of the meeting and of its call to unity were inspired with high hopes. :Ten years later, we still note that there is no place in Holy Orthodoxy for the present case of multi-jurisdictionalism in North America and across the globe, as this only impedes the Church's evangelizing efforts. This was reflected in the Mission and Evangelism Statement issued at Ligonier: \\"We commit ourselves to avoiding the creation of parallel and competitive Orthodox parishes, missions, and mission programs... and to move forward towards a concerted, formal, and united mission program in order to make a real impact on North America through Orthodox mission and evangelism.\\" :Our prayer and efforts should be for one Holy Orthodox Church in North America, a goal that can only be accomplished in the spirit of cooperation and not division. Archbishop Nathaniel (Popp) of Detroit, OCA: :Orthodox Christians working out their salvation in Canada and the United States of America must separately be united into two local Autocephalous Churches, each pastored by hierarchs synergetically working in two unique Holy Synods, each one headed by its own Patriarch. The long-term goal of one hierarch shepherding one metropolis will, in time, manifest itself through the will of the Holy Spirit inspiring the entire Church. Inasmuch as each \\"jurisdiction\\" serves both an ethnic and indigenous flock, it should continue its ministry uninterrupted. Present imperfect \\"Eucharistic unity\\" will be perfected because of administrative unity. Temporarily, administrative unity means each jurisdiction will keep its own administrative structures which, nonetheless, are brought into a national unity through representation by each hierarch in his national, Canadian or American, Holy Synod. Each Autocephalous Church must create a single Constitution and By-laws/Statutes to best serve the needs of the native-born and the immigrant. The unity of the hierarchs, in Synodia, would manifest itself in unity of purpose of internal and external evangelization as outlined ten years ago in the two documents born of the Ligonier meeting. This to be achieved through the movement of the Holy Spirit empowering these Orthodox Christians through fasting, prayer and almsgiving to act creatively. Bishop Ilia of Philomelion, Albanian Diocese: :The time has come for Orthodoxy in America to move beyond simple affirmation of historical, canonical order. It is time to encourage and develop cooperation among churches, which will prove to be a genuine blueprint for greater unity on all fronts. Specific principles need to be articulated and accepted by all jurisdictions in a common commitment to work in consort. Programs of pan- Orthodox endeavor, at the grass roots, should be initiated and supported so that the faithful experience a oneness in purpose and action. Everything is achievable through mutual respect and sensitivity flowing from faith and love in Christ. Bishop Antoun (Khouri) of Miami, Antiochian Archdiocese: :I honestly thought after Ligonier that we were beginning a new era of cooperation and Orthodox unity on this continent. For the first time since the early years of our presence in the Americas, it seemed there was a common vision, or at least a common goal of working together, not just for the sake of working together, but toward a canonically proper end of a unified Church. For me, the chance to sit down with brother bishops, many of whom I had never met, was a great and awesome experience. What made this experience great and awesome, besides just getting together, was that there was a purpose. Often we had gotten together in the past, but just for social purposes or anniversaries, celebrations, etc. This time it was for the good of the Church. Unfortunately, what happened in the aftermath of Ligonier left us further apart and more disunited than we were in the years that led up to that historic gathering. Bishop Basil (Essey) of Wichita, Antiochian Archdiocese: :In 1994 I was a relatively new and young bishop when the now famous Conference of Bishops was convened at the Antiochian Village, and so together with another young bishop, His Grace Seraphim of Ottawa and Canada, I was appointed to the Conference's secretariat. Ligonier '94 was without doubt one of the brightest moments--if not THE brightest moment--in the history of Holy Orthodoxy in the New World. Dozens of bishops met and prayed and deliberated on that Pennsylvania mountain-top, while hundreds of thousands of our young people across the continent prayed and fasted that we might accomplish a good for Holy Orthodoxy. And, by God's grace, a great good was indeed accomplished! The common hope and vision expressed by my brother bishops during those several days and reflected in the two historic documents produced by the Conference caused a refreshing and invigorating breeze to blow across this continent, opening the doors of our Orthodox congregations with hope and joyful anticipation. But sadly and all too quickly, dark storm clouds blew in from the East, causing those doors to be slammed shut once more. Some of those doors were and remained locked to this very day, while others stand ajar, awaiting another refreshing and invigorating breeze to open them once again. May that breeze come quickly! Bishop Joseph (Al-Zehlaoui) of Los Angeles, Antiochian Archdiocese: :The Orthodox Church offers the spiritual healing so many need as they realize the emptiness of secularism and materialism. The task for us in the Church is to offer true spirituality rather than the empty entertainment that passes for Christianity in the West. We must get beyond duels over the Scripture with fundamentalists and revisionists, and instead challenge people with the evidence we have for the true healing and theosis found only in the Orthodox Church. Other comments Expanding on his remarks published in the November 2004 Word Magazine, Bishop Nikolai (Soraich) of Sitka (OCA) had this to say in an open letter in the Winter 2005 issue of his diocesan publication, The North Star (pp. 3–4): :It says in the Akathist that St. Herman envisioned \\"an Episcopal throne in this land.\\" (Ikos 11) It doesn't say anything about multiple thrones, but one--an autocephalous Church in this land--one that came to be in 1970 [i.e., the OCA]. I look back on those seminary years and years later when there was much hope for a united church in America. There were pan-Orthodox celebrations; Sunday of Orthodoxy gatherings were major events and the spirit of the faithful and clergy was elevated in this gathering of the Church. Now we look back just ten years later and find the gathering of bishops at Ligonier is hailed as the greatest event of American Orthodoxy! I wonder how the canonization of America's first saint is relegated to some lesser place in the life of Orthodoxy in America. Even Ligonier was hopeful to those of us who were serving the churches in multiple jurisdictions. Soon we were disappointed when hierarchs removed their names from the documents that were prepared; one on evangelism and the other on administrative unity. :Are we willing to truly pray the Akathist and submit ourselves to the vision of America's most wondrous saint in realizing one Church? We don't need another Ligonier, we need a gathering in Kodiak at the relics of America's first Saint, a prayerful walk on Spruce Island and a willingness to accept the call of Jesus Christ for the sake of Orthodoxy--not disunited, but united! A reply to his letter was published in February 2005 on the Orthodoxy Today website.

The Elp culture (c. 1800—800 BCE)According to the Dutch \\"Het Archeologisch Basisregister (ABR), versie 1.0 november 1992\\" , Elp Kümmerkeramik is dated BRONSMA (early MBA) to BRONSL (LBA), standardized by \\"De Rijksdienst voor Archeologie, Cultuurlandschap en Monumenten (RACM)\\" to a period starting at 1800 BC and ending at 800 BC. is a Bronze Age archaeological culture of the Netherlands having earthenware pottery of low quality known as \\"Kümmerkeramik\\" (also \\"Grobkeramik\\") as a marker. The initial phase is characterized by tumuli (1800–1200 BCE), strongly tied to contemporary tumuli in Northern Germany and Scandinavia, and apparently related to the Tumulus culture (1600–1200 BCE) in Central Europe. This phase was followed by a subsequent change featuring Urnfield (cremation) burial customs (1200–800 BCE). Part of the \\"Nordwestblock\\", it is situated to the north and east of the Rhine and the IJssel (named after the village of Elp in Drenthe province), bordering the Hilversum culture to the south and the Hoogkarspel culture in West Friesland that, together with Elp, all derive from the Barbed Wire Beaker culture (2100–1800 BCE) and, forming a culture complex at the boundary between the Atlantic and the Nordic horizons. First the dead were buried in shallow pits and covered by a low barrow. At the end of the Bronze Age they were cremated and the urns were gathered in low barrows. Family burials occurred only in the later stages. The culture is known for featuring the longhouse, housing people and animals in one and the same building. This construction shows an exceptional local continuity until the twentieth century, still being the normal type of farm in the lowlands of north-western Europe and the Netherlands. The local tradition of concentrating on raising cattle was persisted by the Saxons and the Frisians, whose houses were perched on the natural hillocks in the moist plains, while all other Germanic people practiced sedentary agriculture.Lucien Musset, The Germanic Invasions 1965, Presses Universitaires de France, translated 1975, , p14 Going back to the roots of this tradition, it is generally assumed that its origins lay somewhere in the Bronze Age, between 1800 and 1500 BCE. Probably this change was contemporary to a transition from the two-aisled to the three- aisled farm as early as 1800 BCE. This development bears comparison with what we know from Scandinavia, where the three-aisled house also develops at the same time.H. Fokkens, \\"The longhouse as a central element in Bronze Age daily life \\", Faculty of Archaeology Leiden University, 2002. Within the Northern Bronze Age context, many important reasons are mentioned to the custom of storing cattle inside a building and, moreover, inside the proper house. This could point to a new emphasis on milk production and making cheese, especially since drinking milk was made possible by a gene against lactose intolerance, first to emerge amongst neolithic Northern European populations.Early European unable to stomach milk, University College London (UCL) Cattle stalling was necessary to avoid cows giving less milk in cold conditions (Sherratt, 1983; Zimermann, 1999, 314; Olausson 1999, 321). Social exchange and a role in the supernatural would have been important as well (Fokkens 1999), supported by, for instance, stacks of cowhides in graves and the offerings of animals attested in both Sweden and Denmark (Rasmussen 1999: 287). Protection against cattle raids would fit the circumstances—proven by grave goods, rock engravings and hoards—of a strong martial ideology in this era (Fokkens 1999). These complicated cultural-economic networks that preclude precise ethnic (and thus linguistic) differentiation, supports the maintenance of late contacts between the languages ancestral to Germanic and Celtic, assuming a position of Proto-Celtic to the north of the Hallstatt culture – as supported by the known homelands of La Tène culture.Butler, J.J., S.

Licensed to Wilmington, North Carolina, United States, it serves the Wilmington area. The station is owned by Cumulus Licensing Llc. History The call letters WGNI were originally assigned to 1340 AM in Wilmington. The station went on the air on Christmas Eve in 1945. The original station was owned by General Newspapers Inc, publisher of the Wilmington Post. The Station was known as \\"The Rock of Coastal Carolina\\". The studios were located in the 200 block of Princess Street in downtown Wilmington. The studios were moved to the Eagle Island transmitter site in the late 1950s, then to 211 North Second Street until the spring of 1992, afterwards they relocated to 1890 Dawson Street and then in July 2001 moved to their current location of 3233 Burnt Mill Road in Wilmington. The FM (102.7) was put on the air in 1971 as WAAV, a beautiful music station. By this time, the AM transmitter site had been moved to River Road near Greenfield Lake and the original FM antenna was side mounted on the AM tower. Subsequently, a taller tower was built on the site to house the FM antenna until the station was sold to an owner which then purchased an existing tower south of Wilmington to upgrade their signal. In 1981, WAAV and WGNI were sold to Cape Fear Broadcasting, which was based in Fayetteville with two stations, WFNC and WQSM. Once this sale took place, WAAV & WGNI switched call letters and frequencies, WAAV going to 1340, and WGNI to 102.7. In the process WAAV changed to a \\"Music of Your Life\\" format and WGNI picked up the Adult Contemporary format. In the fall of 1999, Cape Fear Broadcasting announced the sale of their Wilmington and Fayetteville stations to their current owners, Cumulus Media. This sale was challenged by Ocean Broadcasting of Wilmington because it would give Cumulus 6 FMs and an AM in Wilmington, and about 55 percent of market revenue.Michael Futch, \\"For Cumulus, the Wait Continues,\\" The Fayetteville Observer, September 10, 2000. After selling one of their FM's, a change in the FCC, and other matters, the sale was finally approved in the spring of 2001. GNI features several promotions each year. One popular promotion is the WGNI Beach Bag. Each Summer (labeled the 102 Days of Summer), GNI gives listeners the chance to call in and win a Beach Bag. The bag is filled with several prizes. Along with popular contesting and music, WGNI provides the community with frequent traffic and weather information. During the Hurricane Season, GNI is \\"Wilmington's Hurricane Information Station\\" and provides listeners with around the clock weather coverage. Like many other AC stations across the country, WGNI airs 24/7 Christmas music during the holiday season (usually beginning in late November). This is promoted on air as \\"Wilmington's Original All Christmas Music Station.\\" The format continues through mid-night Christmas Day. Currently WGNI's on-air staff includes the nationally syndicated Bob & Sheri Morning show, Wilmington radio veteran and program director Jackie Jordan, and former WBNQ morning show co-host Ray Wagner. Weekends consist of \\"The More Music Weekend,\\" in addition to several syndicated programs including The Hollywood 5 with Bert Weiss, Backtrax USA with Kid Kelly, and The Daly Download with Carson Daly.

The 5-volume series was published by Kodansha between April 1992 and February 1994. It was licensed in the USA by Dark Horse Comics. It has 42 chapters. The series is currently out of print, and the company has no plans to renew the license or reprint the series. The entire series was completely translated in the Dark Horse manga anthology magazine Super Manga Blast, from numbers 13 to 55, however only 3 collected volumes (out of 5) were released. Plot Club 9 centers around a young country girl named Haruo Hattori who is attending university in Tokyo, Japan. She initially lives in her college dorm, but due to circumstances has to move out to an apartment and find a job. When a friend gives her a job as a club hostess at a posh Ginza hostess bar (Club 9), she finds herself getting more attention than she initially wanted. Characters ;Haruo Hattori : Simple, kind, and honest, Haruo is the type of character that easily finds herself in situations before she even realizes that she's in them. Haruo left her small country town in the Akita prefecture to attend college in the big city of Tokyo. While she was in high school she had a loyal boyfriend and managed the school's baseball team. Haruo is incredibly clumsy at times, which often is a result of her trying to help people while not watching the road ahead of her. Haruo initially lived in the dorm rooms of her college, but had to move out after a male ghost kept trying to get her to sleep with him. She found a job with the help of a college friend, Aki, at a local hostess club. Haruo is given the \\"stage name\\" of Miss Hello, and her sweet kindness often attracts more attention than she intends to get. She is a big fan of Makoto Kobayashi, a manga writer who is also a member of the club. Her big goal is to go home to her boyfriend a virgin. In the end Haruo quits Club 9 and becomes just a regular college student. She spends two weeks as a student teacher before graduating. At the series end she has accepted a job as a school teacher in her home town and is reunited with Kingoro. She tells him that she was able to stay a virgin for him, and as the two of them drive off it is heavily implied that they are going to have their \\"first time\\" together. ;Aki Shinohara : Street-wise, sexy, but with a heart of gold, Aki is one of the first to befriend Haruo. She initially allowed Haruo to room with her after her unfortunate run-in with the campus ghost, but pushed her to get an apartment of her own. Aki is often at wit's end whenever Haruo says or does something to show how unaware she is of the surrounding city. One of Aki's dreams is to one day set up a hostess club of her own. Aki thinks nothing of using a man in order to get what she wants (new clothes, jewelry, or a free vacation). This way of thinking would later cause one of her male patrons to aggressively stalk her. After graduation she fulfills her dream of opening a hostess club of her own. ;Fuyumi : Fuyumi is a sweet but somewhat naive girl. She is somewhat more street-smart than Haruo, but is less so than Aki. She works at Club 9 along with Aki and Haruo. Fuyumi has a crush on an actor that frequents the bar, and has hinted that her working relationship has progressed beyond the professional level. After graduation she fulfills her dream of marrying her actor sweetheart, with plans to have children immediately. ;Mama (Club 9 Owner) : She is an older woman who greatly resembles Haruo's own mother. Mama is incredibly sensitive about her age, and often acts in complete denial of it. She shares many characteristics with Haruo's real mother, in that they both act carefree, a bit flighty, but have the best interests for their charges at heart. Mama has an ongoing rivalry with a fellow giza hostess bar called Club Freeman. At the series end she can be seen headhunting while in drag at Club Freeman. ;Kingoro : Kingoro is Haruo's country boyfriend, and was also the pitcher for their successful high school baseball team. When he fails to be picked at the pro draft, he then sets his sights to becoming a great apple farmer. He truly loves Haruo, but is unable to go to Tokyo with her. He often tries to contact her, but never gets a chance to meet her. At the series end he has succeeded in his goal of becoming a great apple farmer, and has made his own special breed of apples, which he named after Haruo. ;Kyosuke Hanazono : An insanely wealthy businessman, he first meets Haruo when she is fetching snacks for the Club 9 patrons. Mistaking him for unemployed and penniless, she purchases food for him unaware that he was unable to purchase anything since he only had large bills and credit cards on him. Hanazono is attracted to Haruo and showers her with expensive gifts, including a custom made sports car. In the manga he says that he was previously in a serious relationship with another woman, but his mother drove her off. After Haruo rejects his proposal, Hanazono uses Haruo (with her cooperation) to trick his mother into accepting the woman he originally wanted to marry. ;Lewis : Manga artist of the popular manga 'Lonely Boy', he falls for Haruo's kindness. When he fails to win a coveted award, Haruo gives him the drive to continue his series. He also asks for Haruo's hand in marriage, but is kindly turned down by her. The next year he wins the award. Makoto Konbayashi : Haruo's favorite manga artist and author of the manga 'What's Bear', his character is a parody of the actual manga artist of the series. (His fictional manga is also a parody of one of Kobayashi's other series, the successful 'What's Michael?'. Bear is the canine companion of the manga's lead feline, Michael.) He is often seen drawing his animals on the skin of the Club 9 hostesses. ;Koji Uryu : Lead pitcher for the Lions, Haruo and Kingoro's favorite pro baseball team. He was in a slump, and spent much of his time drinking and carousing as a result. He came into Club 9 to drink, but was denied alcohol from Haruo on the premise that it ruined his pitching skills. After listening to a speech by Haruo he agreed to only drink the sports drinks she provided. He is another of Haruo's numerous admirers. He is knocked down to the middle leagues after his pitching slump, but is cheered on by Haruo. After an elbow surgery he succeeds in regaining his former glory. ;Mama & Pa Hattori : The parents of Haruo. They live in a small rural town in Akita, and are presumably farmers. Pa is a silent and patient man, while Mama is excitable and flighty. She often woke Haruo up by diving on top of her. Mama is identical in appearance to the owner of Club 9. ;Chinatsu : At the beginning of the Manga, she is Club 9's number one hostess. She is beautiful, refined, and attends a high-class woman's university in Tokyo. Chinatsu's weakness is that, after having the slightest amount of alcohol, she becomes arrogant, abusive, mocking, and truthful about her feelings for her male clients. Sayadoshi Iwata, a toilet company president, is the usual target of her venting as he believes that making Chinatsu drink alcohol will make her more open to seduction. Unfortunately, it leaves Mr. Iwata with graffiti on his forehead, messed up clothing, chocolate sticks up his nose, and a humiliating tirade. Chinatsu is also flat chested and, when drunk, she feels inadequate about her bust and wishes she had larger breasts, backing up her feelings by grabbing either the larger bosoms of Aki or Haruo. ;Rumi, Yuki, Kiyoko, & Kyoko : Four other ginza girls and hostesses working at Club 9 at the beginning of the Manga. They are frequently seen in the background of scenes set at the club throughout. Summary ;Vol 1 : Haruo comes to the big city to study after successfully completing both high school and the management of her local baseball team. When her pitcher boyfriend fails to be picked up by a pro baseball team and has to stay in their small town, Haruo makes a promise to stay a virgin until she arrives back home. However, college life is not all roses, as Haruo's dorm room is haunted by the ghost of a dead teenager who died a virgin. Wanting Haruo to deflower him, he often spends the nights masturbating in front of her. Unable to stay in the dorm room, Haruo temporarily moves in with her classmate Aki until she can find a place of her own. Aki persuades her boss to give Haruo a job at her local hostess club, Club 9. After some initial problems, Haruo easily adapts to the life of a club hostess. ;Vol 2 : Haruo's cheerful personality has made her one of the hits of Club 9. She easily attracts the attention of the club patrons, both the good and the bad. After gaining the attention of a local newsman, she finds that some men would like to have more from her than just a good drink. Haruo manages to escape his clutches, only to have him try to break into her apartment. Luckily for her, he is captured by the police. Also in the same volume, Haruo meets her favorite pitcher, Koji Uryu, who is currently in a pitching slump. When she isn't enchanting the patrons of the club, Haruo is catching the eye of rich businessmen ;Vol 3 : Having recently found out that the poor and unemployed man she fed earlier was none other than the most powerful businessman in Tokyo, Haruo finds herself with more attention than she wants. The businessman, Kyosuke Hanazono, buys her an expensive car for her birthday in hopes of winning her love. While she is being troubled by the idea of attracting men other than her boyfriend, she attends the Kodansha Manga Publisher's Prize award ceremony. When one of her clients doesn't win his coveted award, she must cheer him up in the way only Haruo knows how.

Geography Griffen lies in the wide Jauntal valley of the Drava River, between the Klagenfurt basin in the west and the Lavant Valley in the north. The municipal area comprises the cadastral communities of Griffnerthal, Großenegg (Tolsti Vrh), Haberberg (Gabrje), Kaunz (Homec), Kleindörfl (Mala vas), Pustritz (Pustrica), Sankt Kollmann (Šentkolman), Wölfnitz (Golovica), and Wriesen (Brezje). It is further subdivided into 35 villages and hamlets. History Griffen castle ruins From the 7th century onwards, the Jauntal (Slovene: Podjuna) area was a centre of the Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps and part of the early medieval principality of Carantania. Up to today it remains a core territory of the Carinthian Slovenes. The settlement was first mentioned in an 822 deed, after Carantania had been incorporated into the Carolingian Empire and evolved to the Bavarian March of Carinthia. From 1124 onwards Bishop Otto of Bamberg had Griffen Castle erected within the Carinthian possessions of the prince-bishopric, received from the hands of King Henry II of Germany in 1007. The Grivena fortress was acknowledged as a Bamberg estate by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1160. From 1237 Griffen held market rights. Griffen Abbey From about 1233 the Bamberg bishops had the Romanesque Griffen parish church enlarged and rebuilt as a Premonstratensian monastery. The first canons descended from Vessra Abbey in the Franconian County of Henneberg. The monastery complex was completed in 1272 and significantly enlarged by Baroque buildings in the 17th century. Griffen remained the only Premonstratensian abbey in the Inner Austrian lands until its abolition under the rule of Emperor Joseph II in 1786. Griffen itself remained a possession of the Prince-Bishopric of Bamberg until the estates were purchased by Empress Maria Theresa in 1759. The castle decayed and today lies in ruins. The present-day municipality emerged in 1850, it temporarily also comprised neighbouring Ruden. After the Carinthian referendum of 1920, multiple tensions arose between the Slovene- and German- speaking population, which culminated in the persecution and displacement of Carinthian Slovenes after the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany in 1938. Politics Seats in the municipal assembly (Gemeinderat) as of 2009 local elections: *Austrian People's Party (ÖVP): 14 *Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ) and Independents: 5 *Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ): 4 Notable people The village of Altenmarkt (Stara vas) is the birthplace of Austrian writer Peter Handke, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature.

In 1957, it got a boost to 5,000 watts, under new owners Speidel-Fischer Broadcasting, but it still had to sign-off at sunset. At the time, it aired 90 hours of programming each week for the African-American community.Broadcasting Yearbook 1958 page A-364 The station became WQXL in 1962 after the station was sold to the Belk Broadcasting Company. The WOIC call sign resurfaced that same year on 1320 AM (now WISW). WQXL originally aired a Big Band format, which eventually gave way to a Top 40 format by the end of the decade. However it was handicapped with a daytime-only signal and was unsuccessful in competing against format rivals 1230 WNOK and 1400 WCOS, which each had full-time signals. Probably its most notable personality was Mackie \\"Cactus\\" Quave who had worked at 560 WIS (now WVOC) and had a successful kids TV show on NBC Network affiliate Channel 10 WIS-TV. WQXL switched to country music in the summer of 1966, but again was bested by rival 620 WCAY (now WFMV). In 1973, the station switched to religious programming and eventually adopted a Contemporary Christian format. WQXL was bought by Metro Communications in 1989.Broadcasting Yearbook 2008 page D-476 The company shut down the station on August 23, 2006 in preparation to be moved. While the station was off the air, Metro got the Federal Communications Commission to allow an increase in the station's hours of operation to full-time, powered at 138 watts at night. In the meantime, WQXL's former studios and towers that date back to the WOIC era were torn down in early 2007 as the station moved to Springdale, just outside Columbia. In June 2007, Metro announced WQXL would be sold. The new owner was Glory Communications Inc., owned by Alex Snipe, Jr. of Columbia. Glory already owned 620 WGCV and 95.3 WFMV.

After attending Creighton University, Venditte was drafted by the New York Yankees in 2008. He signed with the Athletics as a free agent before the 2015 season, and made his MLB debut that year. Venditte is a switch pitcher, capable of pitching proficiently with both arms. He is recognized as the only active professional pitcher who is able to do this. Venditte's rare ability to pitch with either arm required both Major and Minor League Baseball to create a rule for ambidextrous pitchers, known colloquially as the \\"Pat Venditte Rule\\". This rule essentially requires any ambidextrous pitcher to declare which hand he will use to pitch to a batter before the at-bat starts, and to throw with that hand through the entire at-bat (unless he is injured during the at-bat). Early life Pat Jr. was born on June 30, 1985 in Omaha, Nebraska, one of four children of Pat Sr. and Janet Venditte. Pat Sr. played college baseball as a catcher. Though his son is naturally right-handed, Pat Sr. trained his son to throw with both arms to give his son an edge in athletic competitions. Toward this end, the Venditte backyard included astroturf, a batting cage, a radar gun, and a pitching machine. In addition to training both arms from a young age, Pat Jr. practiced punting footballs with both legs to establish the leg motion needed when pitching with each arm. Venditte used both arms when playing in Little League, which sometimes caused him to be confused for twins. Venditte attended Omaha Central High School. He had a 15–4 win–loss record during his senior year, earning All-Nebraska second-team honors. College career Venditte joined the Creighton Bluejays in 2005 as a walk-on. Creighton head coach Ed Servais did not allow Venditte to pitch with both arms during his five appearances his freshman year, fearing the spectacle would become a \\"circus\\". Starting with his sophomore season, Venditte regularly used both arms in collegiate play; he posted a 3.02 earned run average (ERA) in innings pitched. After the season, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Quincy Gems of the Central Illinois Collegiate League. In his junior year, Venditte appeared in 36 of Creighton's 58 games before appearing in the 2007 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament. His opponents batting average (OBA) of .185 was the fourth-best in the nation, and he posted a 1.85 ERA. At one point during the season, Venditte had a streak of scoreless innings. On May 28, 2007, Collegiate Baseball named Venditte the national player of the week. For the season, Venditte earned first-team All-Conference honors for the Missouri Valley Conference and was named Most Valuable Player of the conference tournament, in which Creighton won its first conference championship. He was named to the All-American third team for the 2007 season. Venditte was also voted Midwest Region Pitcher of the Year by online pitching magazine InsidePitching.com. After the season, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Wisconsin Woodchucks in the Northwoods League. As the Woodchucks' closer, he had a 4–1 record, 9 saves, a 1.76 ERA, and a .154 opponents' batting average. On June 8, 2007, the New York Yankees selected Venditte in the 45th round of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft with the 1,345th overall pick. Venditte was surprised by the pick, because he had told all major league scouts that he intended to return to Creighton for his senior year. The Yankees called him during the 30th round of the draft, asking him how much it would take to sign him, but Venditte refused to set a price. Ultimately, the Yankees were unable to sign Venditte before the August 15, 2007, signing deadline. Venditte said that he was not quite ready to turn professional and wanted to build velocity with his left arm and add another pitch with his right. Venditte was once again drafted by the Yankees in the 2008 Major League Baseball draft, this time in the 20th round with the 620th overall pick, and this time, he decided to sign. Professional career=New York Yankees Venditte pitching right-handed for the Staten Island Yankees in 2008 His initial assignment was to the Staten Island Yankees of the Class-A Short- Season New York–Penn League. On June 19, 2008, in his first minor league appearance with Staten Island against the Brooklyn Cyclones, Venditte pitched a scoreless ninth inning for a Yankees win. Before Venditte faced the last Cyclone batter, Ralph Henriquez, a switch-hitter, upon choosing to bat left- or right-handed (with Venditte subsequently choosing to pitch with the same hand), Henriquez would then go to the other side of the plate (and adjust his shin guard—which is worn on the front leg when a batter takes his stance) to regain the advantage. After this had happened several times the teams appealed to the umpiring crew, which ruled that the batter must first select from which side of the plate he intended to hit, and that the pitcher would then be allowed to declare with which arm he would pitch (the Venditte Rule, adopted several weeks later by the umpires' association, would make the opposite determination and preserve the traditional right of a switch-hitter to choose an opposite-handed match-up). Venditte subsequently struck out Henriquez, who slammed his bat against the dirt, to end the game. A film of the incident received notoriety on the Internet and the tale was recounted in a number of places, including within the baseball compendium Rollie's Follies. Venditte completed the 2008 season with 23 saves in 30 appearances with a 0.83 ERA. His performance earned him a spot on the New York–Penn League All-Star team and the Minor League Baseball Yearly Award for Best Short-Season Reliever. For the 2009 season, he was assigned to the Charleston RiverDogs of the Class A South Atlantic League. He was promoted to the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League on June 26, 2009. He finished the regular season with a 2.21 ERA and 2 saves in 21 appearances. In October, Venditte pitched for Águilas del Zulia in the Venezuelan Winter League. Venditte pitched for the Yankees in a spring training game against the Atlanta Braves on March 30, 2010, giving up one earned run on two hits and a walk in innings. He started the 2010 season in Tampa, posting a 1.73 ERA through innings in 41 appearances. On August 31, 2010 Venditte was promoted to the Trenton Thunder of the Class-AA Eastern League. Venditte pitched to a 3.41 ERA in 51 appearances with Trenton in 2011. Though Venditte was eligible to be selected in the Rule 5 draft during the 2011–12 offseason, the Yankees chose not to protect him. However, he was not chosen by any MLB team. During the 2011–12 offseason, Venditte pitched in the Mexican Pacific League. Venditte was promoted to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the Class-AAA International League for Opening Day in 2012. He suffered a torn labrum in his right shoulder. He spent most of the 2013 season rehabilitating his shoulder, while also pitching exclusively with his left arm. He pitched for the Italian national baseball team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic, and for Trenton in the 2013 postseason. He then pitched in the Mexican Pacific League over the winter, and struggled. The Yankees did not invite Venditte to spring training in 2014. Though Venditte had excellent minor league numbers, he was not considered a top prospect because of his age and, scouts believed, underwhelming fastball velocity. He started the 2014 season with Trenton, but was called up again to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre after a month, in which he pitched to a 0.82 ERA and 0.73 walks plus hits per inning pitched ratio in 22 innings. In his first outing after the promotion, he struck out all five batters that he faced, three throwing left-handed and two throwing right- handed. Oakland Athletics After the 2014 season, Venditte became a free agent. During the offseason, he signed a minor league contract with the Oakland Athletics, receiving an invitation to spring training in 2015. Venditte began the 2015 season with the Nashville Sounds of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL). He pitched to a 1.36 ERA with 33 strikeouts in 17 games for Nashville before he was promoted to the Athletics for his first major-league stint on June 5. He pitched two scoreless innings, and got his first strikeout in his major league debut. The East Oregonian a newspaper published in Pendleton,Oregon mistakenly described the ambidextrous Viditte's first MLB appearance as \\"Amphibious Pitcher Makes Debut\\". The mistake was widely reported humorously in the national popular press. Venditte pitched in four games, not allowing a run in innings pitched, before he strained his right shoulder and the Athletics placed Venditte on the disabled list on June 12. Venditte was reactivated by the A's on August 3, 2015 and optioned to AAA Nashville. He was recalled to the A's on August 15 and earned his first major league win on August 30. Overall, Venditte posted an ERA of 4.40 in 26 games for Oakland in 2015. Toronto Blue Jays On October 19, 2015, Venditte was claimed off waivers by the Toronto Blue Jays. He was assigned to the Buffalo Bisons of the International League to start the 2016 season, and was recalled by the Blue Jays on April 13 after Arnold León was designated for assignment. Venditte made his Blue Jays debut on April 13, 2016 against the New York Yankees, pitching one scoreless inning to finish a 7–2 Blue Jays win. On April 27, he was optioned back to Triple-A. Venditte was recalled on May 17, and sent back on May 25. On June 7, Venditte was recalled once again. Overall, Venditte posted an ERA of 5.19 in 8 games for Toronto in 2016. > Seattle Mariners On August 6, 2016, Venditte was traded to the Seattle Mariners for player to be named later (Tim Lopes). He was optioned to the Tacoma Rainiers of the PCL on August 6, and was recalled on August 27. The Mariners outrighted Venditte off of the 40-man roster to Tacoma after the season. Philadelphia Phillies On March 12, 2017, the Mariners traded Venditte to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for minor league player Joey Curletta. He spent the 2017 season with the Lehigh Valley IronPigs of the International League, and elected free agency on November 6, 2017. Los Angeles Dodgers On November 27, 2017, Venditte signed a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. After beginning the 2018 season with the Oklahoma City Dodgers of the PCL, he was called up to the majors on May 12. He was selected to represent the PCL at the Triple-A All-Star Game. He was designated for assignment by the Dodgers on November 28. San Francisco Giants Venditte signed a one-year, $585,000, contract with the San Francisco Giants on December 21, 2018. On May 7, 2019, Venditte was placed on waivers, and on May 12, cleared waivers and reported to Sacramento of the Pacific Coast League. He missed almost two months of the season while his wife, Erin, recovered from a brain hemmorhage.He elected free agency on October 4, 2019. Miami Marlins On January 6, 2020 Venditte signed a minor league contract, with an invitation to spring training, with the Miami Marlins. Venditte elected free agency on July 14, 2020. He resigned a minor league deal on August 5, 2020. His contract was selected by the Marlins on August 8th, 2020. Pitching style When using his right arm, Venditte used to deliver over the top and could throw a slider and curveball, as well as a fastball at around that topped out at . His left-handed delivery is side-armed in which he throws a slider and a fastball that reaches the low-to-mid 80s. Following Venditte's 2012 surgery on his right shoulder, Gil Patterson worked with him on a right- handed sidearm delivery. Although the injury slowed his right arm, Venditte's delivery is now almost identical from either side, and observers have mistaken him for identical twins because he warms up one hand with the starting pitchers and the other with the relievers. Venditte is only ambidextrous when pitching. Despite batting left-handed, he is exclusively right-handed when performing tasks such as swinging a golf club, writing, or eating. Venditte generally pitches with his right arm against right-handed batters and left- handed against left-handed batters, which minimizes his opponent's advantage when strategically ordering batters in the line-up based on which side of the plate they hit from. Mizuno has custom-made six-fingered gloves for Venditte since the age of seven with a thumb-hole on each side, allowing him to easily switch back and forth. By splitting his pitches between his arms, he is able to pitch longer than traditional pitchers before becoming fatigued; ESPN in 2015 speculated that Venditte \\"has quite possibly thrown more baseballs than any other man his age in history because he's had twice as many arms with which to throw them\\". The Pat Venditte Rule Venditte's rare ambidextrous abilities prompted the Professional Baseball Umpire Corporation (PBUC) to issue a new rule for dealing with ambidextrous pitchers, limiting the number of times that a switch-pitcher and switch-hitter can change sides during one at-bat. After consulting with a variety of sources, including the Major League Baseball Rules Committee, the PBUC issued its new guidelines on July 3, 2008. OBR Rule 5.08(f), known as the \\"Pat Venditte Rule\\", currently reads: Both NCAA and the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) have adopted similar rules. NCAA rule 9-2k and NFHS rule 6–1–1. Personal life Venditte is married to Erin, whom he met while they were both enrolled at Creighton. They reside in Omaha during the offseason. See also *Greg A. Harris, the only other \\"switch-pitcher\\" in Major League Baseball's modern era. Harris enjoyed a 15-year career as a right-handed pitcher and threw left- handed to only two batters in a single MLB game due to his teams not allowing him to pitch left-handed once he had developed the skill to do so. *Tony Mullane, a dead-ball-era pitcher who routinely switch-pitched ReferencesExternal links E:60 Pat Venditte *Pat Venditte – MiLB statistics * * Category:1985 births Category:Águilas de Mexicali players Category:Águilas del Zulia players Category:American sportspeople of Italian descent Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Baseball players from Nebraska Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players Category:Cañeros de Los Mochis players Category:Charleston RiverDogs players Category:Creighton Bluejays baseball players Category:Gulf Coast Yankees players Category:Living people Category:Lehigh Valley IronPigs players Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Miami Marlins players Category:Nashville Sounds players Category:Oakland Athletics players Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:Seattle Mariners players Category:Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders players Category:Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees players Category:Sportspeople from Omaha, Nebraska Category:Staten Island Yankees players Category:Stockton Ports players Category:Tacoma Rainiers players Category:Tampa Yankees players Category:Toronto Blue Jays players Category:Trenton Thunder players Category:2013 World Baseball Classic players Category:2017 World Baseball Classic players Category:Oklahoma City Dodgers players Category:Sacramento River Cats players Category:Omaha Central High School alumni ","title":"Pat Venditte"},{"id":"10870829","text":"Hanfu being worn during a festival in London The hanfu movement () is a social movement seeking to revitalize ancient Han Chinese fashion that developed in China at the beginning of the 21st century. Background Han and Manchu clothing coexisted during Qing dynasty Han Chinese clothing in early Qing When the Manchus established the Qing dynasty, the authorities issued decrees having Han Chinese men to adopt Manchu hairstyle by shaving their hair on the front of the head and braiding the hair on the back of the head into pigtails. The resistances against the hair shaving policy were suppressed. Han Chinese did not object to wearing the queue braid on the back of the head as they traditionally wore all their hair long, but fiercely objected to shaving the forehead so the Qing government exclusively focused on forcing people to shave the forehead rather than wear the braid. Han rebels in the first half of the Qing who objected to Qing hairstyle wore the braid but defied orders to shave the front of the head. One person was executed for refusing to shave the front but he had willingly braided the back of his hair. It was only later westernized revolutionaries, influenced by western hairstyle who began to view the braid as backward and advocated adopting short haired western hairstyles. Han rebels against the Qing like the Taiping even retained their queue braids on the back but the symbol of their rebellion against the Qing was the growing of hair on the front of the head, causing the Qing government to view shaving the front of the head as the primary sign of loyalty to the Qing rather than wearing the braid on the back which did not violate Han customs and which traditional Han did not object to. Koxinga insulted and criticized the Qing hairstyle by referring to the shaven pate looking like a fly. Koxinga and his men objected to shaving when the Qing demanded they shave in exchange for recognizing Koxinga as a feudatory. The Qing demanded that Zheng Jing and his men on Taiwan shave in order to receive recognition as a fiefdom. His men and Ming prince Zhu Shugui fiercely objected to shaving. Some Han civilian men also voluntarily adopted Manchu clothing like changshan on their own free will. By the late Qing, not only officials and scholars, but a great many commoners as well, started to wear Manchu attire.Twitchett, Denis; Fairbank, John K. (2008) Cambridge History of China Volume 9 Part 1 The Ch'ing Empire to 1800, p87-88 Proponents of the movement claim that hanfu's chief characteristics were symbolic of cultural moral and ethical values: \\"the left collar covering the right represents the perfection of human culture on human nature and the overcoming of bodily forces by the spiritual power of ethical ritual teaching; the expansive cutting and board sleeve represents a moral, concordant relation between nature and human creative power; the use of the girdle to fasten the garment over the body represents the constraints of Han culture to limit human's desire that would incur amoral deed. In the Qing Dynasty, officials replaced the hanfu with the attire of Manchu. Though many people believe that the qipao is China's national costume, it is fairly modern. In the Edo period of Tokugawa Shogunate Japan orders were passed for Japanese men to shave the pâté on the front of their head (the chonmage hairstyle) and shave their beards, facial hair and side whiskers. This was similar to the Qing dynasty queue order imposed by Dorgon making men shave the pâtés on the front of their heads. Traditional Ming dynasty Hanfu robes given by the Ming Emperors to the Chinese noble Dukes Yansheng descended from Confucius are still preserved in the Confucius Mansion after over five centuries. Robes from the Qing emperors are also preserved there. The Jurchens in the Jin dynasty and Mongols in the Yuan dynasty continued to patronize and support the Confucian Duke Yansheng. History Western-style trousers and patent leather shoes According to Asia Times Online, the hanfu movement may have begun around 2003. Wang Letian from Zhengzhou, China, publicly wore hanfu. He and his followers inspired others to reflect on the cultural identity of Han Chinese. They organized the hanfu movement as an initiative in a broader effort to stimulate a Han Chinese cultural renaissance.\\"Han follow suit in cultural renaissance\\", Asian Times Online In the same year of 2003, supporters of Han revivalism launched the website Hanwang (, \\"Han Network\\") to promote traditional Han clothing, however some sources claim this to be alongside a Han supremacist agenda. In February 2007, advocates of hanfu submitted a proposal to the Chinese Olympic Committee to have it be the official clothing of the Chinese team in the 2008 Summer Olympics.\\"Submission for a Proposal on hanfu dress for the 2008 Chinese Olympics to the China Olympics Committee\\" , Phoenix TV The Chinese Olympic Committee rejected the proposal in April 2007.官方首次表态北京奥运礼服不用汉服 Definition of hanfu According to Dictionary of Old Chinese Clothing (), the term hanfu means \\"dress of the Han people.\\" This term, which is not commonly used in ancient times, can be found in some historical records from Han, Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties and the Republican era in China.《宋史》：“吾家世為王民，自金人犯邊，吾兄弟不能以死報國，避難入關，今為曦所逐，吾不忍棄漢衣冠，願死於此，為趙氏鬼。” Critics have contended that the term hanfu is a modern development. An article published by Chinese Newsweek in September 2005 reported that it is not included in the authoritative dictionary of Standard Mandarin Chinese \\"Contemporary Chinese Dictionary\\" () and that it was coined by Internet users around the year 2003. Professor of China Youth University of Political Studies Zhang Xian () asserts that hanfu is a modern concept publicized by student advocates of the hanfu movement who created a standard of pre-Qing Han Chinese fashion without accurate academic research and propagated it on collaborative, web-based encyclopedias such as Baidu Baike and Hanwang. In the same vein, the American scholar of contemporary Chinese society, professor of Macquarie University Kevin Carrico criticized the hanfu for being an \\"invented style of dress\\" which \\"made the transition from a fantastic invented tradition to a distant image on a screen to a physical reality in the streets of China, in which one could wrap and recognise oneself\\".Kevin Carrico, \\"The Great Han Race, Nationalism, and Tradition in China Today\\", UC Press, 2017, He maintains that there is no clear history indicating that there was any specific apparel in existence under the name hanfu. Chinese researcher Hua Mei (), interviewed by student advocates of the hanfu movement in 2007, recognizes that defining hanfu is no simple matter, as there was no uniform style of Chinese fashion throughout the millennia of its history. Because of its constant evolution, she questions which period's style can rightly be regarded as traditional. Nonetheless, she explains that hanfu has historically been used to broadly refer to indigenous Chinese clothing in general. Observing that the apparel most often promoted by the movement are based on the Han-era quju and zhiju, she suggests that other styles, especially that of the Tang era, would also be candidates for revival in light of this umbrella definition. Professor of Aichi University, cultural anthropologist Zhou Xing () maintains that the term hanfu was not commonly used in ancient times and refers to the traditional costume as imagined by participants of the hanfu movement. Like Hua, he notes that the term hanfu classically referred to clothing that Han people wore in general, but in contrast, he argues that, on this basis, it is not the same as the hanfu as defined by participants of the movement. Controversy Hanfu movement supporters wearing Hanfu Two Hanfu promoters at the Chinese Cultural Festival in Guangzhou Among the opposition to the hanfu movement, a common concern is its implication for ethnic minorities. Skeptics fear that there is an element of exclusivity which could brew ethnic tensions, especially if it were to be nationalized.\\"Should China Adopt Hanfu as Its National Costume? \\", Beijing Review, 10 July 2007 For this reason, supporters of the movement are sometimes labeled as \\"Han chauvinists\\". Nevertheless, it has been insisted by some hanfu advocates that none of them have ever suggested that minorities must abandon their own indigenous styles of dress and that personal preference for a style of fashion can be independent of political or nationalistic motives. Students consulted by Hua Mei cited the persistence of indigenous clothing among Chinese minorities, and the usage of kimono in Japan, hanbok in North Korea and South Korea, and traditional clothing used in India as an inspiration for the hanfu movement. Even some ardent enthusiasts interviewed by the South China Morning Post in 2017, among them the Hanfu Society at Guangzhou University have cautioned against extending the dress beyond social normalization among Han Chinese people, acknowledging the negative repercussions politicization of the movement may have on society. According to Kevin Carrico, an lecturer at Monash University, there is a belief that the movement is inherently racial at its core, insists in that it is built on the narrative that the Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty were single-mindedly dedicated to the destruction of the Han people and thus of China itself, fundamentally transforming Chinese society and shifting its essence \\"from civilisation to barbarism\\". He argues that real atrocities such as the Yangzhou massacre, during which Manchu soldiers devastated the city of Yangzhou, and the forceful imposition of the queue decree, are fused with the imaginary injustice of the forcible erasure of Han clothing. According to his research, underpinning the movement are conspiracy theories made by some hanfu advocates which claim that a secret Manchu plot for restoration has been underway since the start of the post-1978 reform era, such that the Manchus secretly control every important party-state institution, including the People’s Liberation Army, the Party Propaganda Department, the Ministry of Culture and especially the National Population and Family Planning Commission.Kevin Carrico, A State of Warring Styles According to James Leibold, an associate professor in Chinese politics and Asian studies at La Trobe University, pioneers of the hanfu movement have confessed to believing that the issue of Han clothing cannot be separated from the larger issue of racial identity and political power in China. He cites the website Hanwang (, 'Han Network') as an example of their Han supremacist agenda. Launched in 2003, Hanwang's constitution asserted that \\"Han culture is the world's most advanced and its race is one of the strongest and most prosperous\\" and endorsed the reintroduction of traditional Han clothing. Nonetheless, Leibold has mentioned that \\"one would be mistaken in believing that all Hanfu supporters share the political agenda embedded in the Hanwang constitution. Rather, the movement encompasses a very diverse group of individuals who find different sorts of meaning and enjoyment in the category of Han.\\" Eric Fish, a freelance writer who lived in China from 2007 to 2014 as a teacher, student, and journalist, believed that the hanfu movement does have \\"patriotic undertones\\" but \\"most Hanfu enthusiasts are in it for the fashion and community more than a racial or xenophobic motivation\\". He also mentioned that contrary to popular belief, China's \\"young people overall are progressively getting less nationalistic\\".

It is the sequel to Rosemary's Baby. Plot The novel begins in November 1999, with Rosemary Woodhouse waking up in a long-term care facility. She has lain in a coma since 1973. Wholly unharmed, Rosemary soon learns that her coma resulted from a spell the coven cast on her when they discovered that she planned to run away with her young son, Andy. In her absence, Andy was raised by Minnie and Roman Castevet, the leaders of the coven. Rosemary recovered only after the coven's last member had died. Rosemary finds that Andy, now 33 years old, is the popular and charismatic leader of an international charitable organization. Mother and son are reunited, and Rosemary instantly becomes world-famous both for her remarkable recovery and as Andy's long-lost mother. Rosemary is also struck and puzzled by a repeated reference to \\"roast mules\\", an anagram that many people continually mention. Andy assures his mother that he has rebelled against the coven's evil influence. He says he uses his powers to achieve world peace, but a long chain of deadly events leads Rosemary to believe that her son has unwittingly become the Antichrist and is ushering in the end of the world. Her fears are proven when a candle- lighting event that Andy has organized to celebrate the new millennium unleashes a deadly virus that destroys all human life. In the wake of the destruction, Satan returns to Earth and drags Rosemary into Hell. Rosemary abruptly awakens to find that it is 1965 again and that she is still married to Guy Woodhouse. The events of the entire first book and that of the second book up to that point have all been Rosemary's vivid dream. Rosemary and Guy receive a call from Rosemary's friend Edward \\"Hutch\\" Hutchins, who offers the couple a rent-free apartment in the Dakota Apartments (the model for the Bramford, their apartment building in the first book) for one year. The couple is delighted at the offer, until Hutchins makes a remark about lighting candles and \\"roast mules\\" that causes Rosemary to regard her dream as a possible forewarning of future events. The anagram The book contains the anagram puzzle \\"roast mules\\". Levin never gives the answer to his readers, simply saying that it is a word that most five-year-old children would recognize. However, many online users speculate that it could be \\"somersault\\" or \\"soul master\\". The ending After Rosemary wakes up, she receives a phone call from her friend Hutch, who suggests that Rosemary and Guy would move to an apartment in the Dakota. He mentions that one of The Beatles is looking into buying an apartment there. This comment may be treated as an inside joke, since John Lennon and Yoko Ono did indeed purchase an apartment at the Dakota, in which the film Rosemary's Baby was filmed. However, they purchased it in 1973, while Hutch tells Rosemary about this in 1965. This may be a hint that Rosemary did not wake up in the past, and did not dream all of the events of the novel. Furthermore, in the center of the novel, there is an episode when Rosemary finds herself in Strawberry Fields, Lennon's memorial garden in Central Park. This takes place at the beginning of December, around the anniversary of Lennon's death. Having been in a coma for 27 years, she is not aware of Lennon's murder, and she does not recognize the words \\"Imagine\\" at the center of the garden. This episode remains unexplained in the novel, though it may be a hint that Rosemary did not dream it, as how could she dream Lennon's memorial garden, back in 1965? Therefore, the ending may suggest that Satan does, in fact, kill Rosemary and drag her down into Hell (after admitting that he had lied to her when promising her eternal youth). Her \\"waking up\\" in 1965 is, in fact, the afterlife or Purgatory.

Via altered the schedule and improved connections, resulting in quadrupling of passenger counts. Train lengths expanded from 1 car to as many as 4 cars at peak service. Drastic cuts to Via Rail's funding in the 1989 federal budget saw Minister of Transport Benoît Bouchard authorize the abandonment of 55% of Via's service, including the Evangeline, effective January 15, 1990.

The archbishop of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, by far the largest of Constantinopolitan jurisdictions in the US, is considered the local primate and may convene a Holy Synod of all the hierarchs of the Ecumenical throne in America. Reliable statistics are difficult to find, but the Ecumenical Patriarchate has roughly 500,000 adherents (or up to 2 million, by some estimates) in the United States worshiping at about 750 parishes (about 725) and monasteries (about 25). This includes 14 defined dioceses (a number of which overlap, since multiple jurisdictions exist), governed by 19 diocesan and auxiliary bishops. Thus Constantinople is by far the largest numerical representation of Eastern Orthodoxy in North America, including roughly twice as many Eastern Orthodox Christians under its omophorion than all other jurisdictions combined and about two-fifths of all Orthodox bishops in America. Of the nine bishops who are members of SCOBA, four represent Constantinopolitan jurisdictions. Jurisdictions *Albanian Orthodox Diocese of America *American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese *Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America *Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA Stavropegial institutions The Patriarchal and Stavropegial Orthodox Monastery of St. Irene Chrysovalantou in Astoria, New York, founded in 1972, had historically been part of the Old Calendarist movement (specifically the \\"Kiousis Synod\\") but in 1998 it came under the omophorion of the Ecumenical Patriarch. Though not formally organized as a diocese, the monastery and its ten metochia--two monasteries and eight parishes--essentially function as a jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in the United States (also including one mission in Belize). The abbot and the deputy abbot of the monastery are both bishops, governing not only the monastery but also the metochia, most of which are in the northeastern United States. Apart from a second monastery in Astoria, New York, and one in North Fort Myers, Florida, there are four parishes in New York, one in Delaware, one in Florida, one in Illinois, and one in Belize. (The list at the Greek Archdiocese website also includes a parish in New Jersey.) The current abbot is Metropolitan Paisios (Loulourgas) of Tyana, who led the monastery and its metochia into the Ecumenical Patriarchate along with the deputy abbot, Bishop Vikentios (Malamatenios) of Apameia. Both Paisios and Vikentios were ordained upon entry into the patriarchate, as their previous ordinations in the Old Calendarist movement were regarded as invalid. The monastery and its metochia are stavropegial, directly under the Ecumenical Patriarch, and until recently continued to follow the Julian Calendar, but are using the Revised Julian Calendar for some years. The Patriarch Athenagoras Orthodox Institute in Berkeley, California, is also a stavropegial institution of the patriarchate. Hierarchs *Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America ** Abp.

NGC 6818 is located in the constellation of Sagittarius (The Archer), roughly 6000 light-years away from Earth. The glow of the cloud is just over half a light-year across. When stars like the Sun are near end of life, they send their outer layers into space to create glowing clouds of gas, a planetary nebulae. This ejection of mass is uneven, and planetary nebulae can have complex shapes. NGC 6818 shows knotty filament-like structures and distinct layers of material, with a bright and enclosed central bubble surrounded by a larger, more diffuse cloud.

Typically MLE programs are situated in developing countries where speakers of minority languages, i.e. non-dominant languages, tend to be disadvantaged in the mainstream education system. There are increasing calls to provide first-language-first education to immigrant children from immigrant parents who have moved to the developed world.  Components of Multilingual Education (MLE)  * \\"Strong Foundation\\" - Research shows that children whose early education is in the language of their home tend to do better in the later years of their education (Thomas and Collier, 1997). For more information about the effect of \\"Language of Instruction\\", see Bilingual education. * \\"Strong Bridge\\" - an essential difference between MLE programs and rural \\"mother tongue education\\" programs is the inclusion of a guided transition from learning through the mother tongue to learning through another tongue. Related to the emphasis on a child's mother tongue is the implicit validation of her cultural or ethnic identity by taking languages which were previously considered \\"non-standard\\" and making active use of them in the classroom. Multilingual Education in that sense underscores the importance of the child's worldview in shaping his or her learning.  Stages of an MLE program  A widespread understanding of MLE programs (UNESCO, 2003, 2005) suggests that instruction take place in the following stages: # Stage I - learning takes place entirely in the child's home language # Stage II - building fluency in the mother tongue. Introduction of oral L2. # Stage III - building oral fluency in L2. Introduction of literacy in L2. # Stage IV - using both L1 and L2 for lifelong learning. MLE proponents stress that the second language acquisition component is seen as a \\"two-way\\" bridge, such that learners gain the ability to move back and forth between their mother tongue and the other tongue(s), rather than simply a transitional literacy program where reading through the mother tongue is abandoned at some stage in the education. Based on the theories of Multilingual Education that are spelled out here, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa have adopted a thematic approach to multilingual education. Using a seasonal calendar within a relevant cultural context has provided a space to the tribal children of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh to rediscover their culture through their language. The Multilingual Education in this approach emphasizes first language first in the child taking the socio- cultural curriculum in to classroom culture and then bridge to second language. In addition to the basic theory of Paulo Freire on critical pedagogy, Gramscian theory on education, Lev Vigostky's scaffolding and Piaget's theory of cognition is applied in the Multilingual Education. The unique thing in this approach is to involve the community in creating their own curriculum and minimise the theoretical hegemony, thereby creating a new set of people who believe in the ethics of creating and sharing knowledge for the society than to limit it to the theoreticians. Multilingual education in Odisha Odisha is a multilingual state having more than 40 ethnic languages among the 62 scheduled tribes, along with the Modern Indian Languages like Hindi, Bengali and Telugu. To address the language- education of ethnic minorities children in schools, the Odisha government started Multilingual Education programme, ten tribal languages. Led by Dr Mahendra Kumar Mishra, as the Director of Multilingual Education and guided by Prof. D P Pattanayak and Prof Khageswar Mahapatra, the eminent multilingual Experts, the state government started MLE programme in te tribal languages in 547 schools. 10 tribal languages were adopted. These are Santali, Saora, Kui, Kuvi, Koya, Kishan, Oroam, Juang, Bonda and Ho. Culturally responsive curriculum and textbooks were prepared for class I to Class V to maintain mother tongue-based multilingual education to educate the tribal children. The state government appointed teachers from the same language community in the schools to teach the tribal children. Language policy was also formulated. The programme was also supported by Summer Institute of Linguistics led by Mr Steve Simpson and Vicky Simpson, Pamela Mackenzie. The curriculum and textbooks were prepared by the tribal teachers guided by the MLE resource groups. It was initiated in 2005 and is now running in 2250 schools with majority tribal children. This is a sustained MLE programme in Asian countries. About 7 Asian countries have visited the MLE schools.  Multilingual education in developed countries  Scholars and educators have argued that embracing the diverse linguistic knowledge that immigrant students bring to the developed countries, such as the United States, and using students’ first-languages to help them learn English may be an inexpensive and effective way to integrate and socialize immigrant youth. Allowing code- switching in schools with high English learner (EL) populations can increase the potential for enhanced English-learning and academic performance. Code- switching between multi-lingual children can create an informal peer- mentorship structure that embraces immigrant children’s linguistic capabilities to drive learning, create a strong peer-network, and enhance the development of English as a Second Language skills for immigrant students in multi-ethnic schools. Dr Mahendra Kumar Mishra started the MLE programme in Chhatisgarh adopting Durua language in MLE programme. Dr Mishra conducted 2 NAtional Seminars and one international Seminar on MLE during 2006-2019. Dr Tove Skutnabb Kangas, Prof Ofelia Gracia, Dr David Haugh, Dr Sitakanta Mahapatra, Dr KHageswar Mohapatra were some of the linguists and multilingual educators attended these conferences.

The 2 cylinder engine would have been familiar to any driver of the less powerful DAF 33, and the bore remained unchanged at 85.5 mm. Stroke was increased to 73.5 mm, however, giving an increase in engine displacement from 746 cc to 844 cc and an increase in claimed output from 28 bhp to 34 bhp. The compression ratio remained low enough to permit the use of relatively low octane fuel. Stopping power commensurate with the car's rather leisurely performance came from all-round drum brakes. An innovative feature for the time was face-level ventilation with adjustable fascia mounted outlets. The spare wheel was stored under the front hood / bonnet which left more space for luggage at the back and makes the point that the engine was a relatively compact one. The DAF 44 also provided the underpinnings for the tall-built Swedish specialty vehicle Kalmar KVD 440 (\\"Tjorven\\"). The DAF 44, in common with other DAF cars, featured an innovative continuously variable transmission system, the DAF Variomatic. In addition to the 2-door saloon, a 2-door estate or panel van version were also available. Production ended in November 1974 after 167,902 had been built. While the 44 was replaced by the short-lived DAF 46, leftover cars continued to be available for some time.

The school is a collocated facility with the monastery. The school possesses a library of 8,000 titles. History The monastery was founded in 1923 by Montenegrin Serb Bishop Saint Mardarije as a school for the Serbian Orthodox Church. It is unique in North America among Orthodox seminaries for being linked to and deriving its traditional Orthodox ethos from a monastery out of which it grew. Dionisije Milivojević was appointed the bishop of the American-Canadian Diocese in 1939. During World War II, the Libertyville monastery became an American refuge for Orthodox Serbs. In 1964, Serbian Patriarch German defrocked American Bishop Dionisije Milivojević over political and administrative issues. This forced a split between the Serbian and North American branches of the church. The result was two separate North American churches—the Serbian Orthodox Church in the USA and Canada in Libertyville and the Diocese of New Gracanica – Midwestern America in nearby Third Lake. The Illinois Supreme Court deemed that this schism was a violation of the mother church's regulations and forbade recognition of Bishop Dionisije. However, in 1976, the United States Supreme Court ruled that this was in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in Serbian Orthodox Diocese v. Milivojevich. Peter II of Yugoslavia, the last Yugoslav king, lived at the monastery after being exiled by Josip Broz Tito. He died at the church in 1970 and his will stipulated that he wished to be buried there. More than 10,000 attended his funeral. He lay there until his remains were repatriated to Serbia in 2013. The property is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Geography The municipality lies in the upper Lavant valley (Lavanttal) north of the district capital Wolfsberg. The municipal area comprises the cadastral communities of Erzberg, Görlitzen, Kliening, Bad Sankt Leonhard proper, Schiefling, Schönberg, Theißing, and Twimberg. Bad Sankt Leonhard has access to the Süd Autobahn (A2). The Lavant Viaduct across the valley was inaugurated in 1986; with a height of , it is the second highest bridge in Austria. History St Leonard's Church The area was settled since ancient times, when a Roman road led through the Lavanttal up to the Obdach Saddle pass and the Mur valley in present-day Upper Styria. In the 11th century, the surrounding Carinthian estates were enfeoffed to the Bishops of Bamberg by Emperor Henry II. A first chapel dedicated to Saint Leonard was consecrated during the tenure of Bishop Otto (1102–1139). His successors also had Gomarn Castle erected in order to protect their possessions, mainly from the rivalling Bishops of Lavant who resided at nearby Twimberg Castle. The settlement below the chapel was first mentioned in a 1278 deed, its citizens already had received town privileges by 1311, at the time when the Gothic parish church was erected. In the 15th century, mining for gold and silver became common in the area, run by the Fugger merchant family from Augsburg. Also, Sankt Leonhard became known for its mineral springs (Preblauer); the waters were mentioned by the physician Paracelsus in 1538. The Bamberg bishops finally sold the estates to the Habsburg empress Maria Theresa in 1759. Sankt Leonhard received the official status of a spa town (Bad) in 1935. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, several medieval stained glass windows of the parish church were sold and are now on display at The Cloisters museum in New York City.

After OISM had been dormant for a number of years, in late 2003 Fr. Michael Dahulich (dean of St. Tikhon's and also a former member of OISM) invited a number of schools to St. Tikhon's in an effort to revive the organization. At this fall retreat, students met in prayer and fellowship. They also participated in a lecture by Fr. Daniel Kovalak which emphasized the importance of missiology in the church. At a meeting which concluded the festivities, representatives from the various schools formed an interim board with the goal of re-establishing the organization. In the Spring semester of 2004, a general assembly was convened at St. Vladimir's Seminary in Crestwood, New York. At this general assembly, in addition to St. Vladimir's Seminary, there were representatives present from St. Herman's Seminary of Kodiak, Alaska; Holy Cross Seminary/Hellenic College of Brookline, Massachusetts; Holy Trinity Seminary of Jordanville, New York; and St. Tikhon's Seminary of South Canaan, Pennsylvania.

The Lavamünd hydroelectric power plant on the Drava River and the Koralpe power plant are located in or near Lavamünd. Geography View across the Drava Lavamünd lies in the southeast of Carinthia, close to the border with Slovenia (Slovene Carinthia). It is situated at the confluence of the Lavant and Drava rivers. In the northeast, the Soboth Pass leads across the Koralpe range to Eibiswald in Styria. At an elevation of AA, the area is the lowest part of Carinthia. The municipal area consists of the cadastral communities of Ettendorf, Großlamprechtsberg, Hart (Dobrova), Lamprechtsberg- Hartneidstein, Lavamünd proper, Lorenzenberg (Šentlovrenc), Magdalensberg, Rabenstein (Rabštajn pri Labotu), Weißenberg, and Wunderstätten (Drumlje pri Labotu). History The region in the Drava valley was already settled in Roman times. The estates at the confluence with the Lavant River were mentioned in a 1091 deed of donation, issued by the local Sponheim count Engelbert I in favour of newly established Saint Paul's Abbey. The market town itself arose in the 13th century; it was first documented in 1334. Habsburg Emperor Frederick III vested the citizens with high justice rights (Blutgerichtsbarkeit) in 1461. The present-day municipality was established in 1850. Upon the 1920 Carinthian plebiscite, the neighbouring area of Dravograd (Unterdrauburg) fell to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. 96.9% of the Lavamünd citizens voted to remain with the Austrian Republic.

This lively show features regular guest appearances by Pete Townshend, Simon Townshend and Jerry Hall. The shows feature musical numbers, short films and other special guests. In The Attic began in October 2005 as a way to entertain Fuller's devoted web fans. It has gained a steady following on the internet as it attracts a blend of fans, mainly those of Rachel Fuller, The Who, Pete Townshend's solo work, and Simon Townshend's band, 'The Casbah Club'. Current news and future plans Rachel Fuller and ITA toured with Townshend's band The Who for the duration of the 2006–2007 Who world tour. Documentary filmmaker Justin Kreutzmann headed the In The Attic camera crew as an electronic news gatherer filming any backstage antics and local flavor that Rachel Fuller and The Who deem fit to show on their respective websites, eventually creating a long form DVD documentary of the entire tour due out in 2007. Following ITA's tour of Europe, 'Attic Intravision' was set up to showcase both Series One and Series Two of the show and to coincide with The Who's world tour. Sandi Thom controversy In The Attic pre-dates the emergence of Scottish singer songwriter Sandi Thom's copycat show From The Basement (later changed to 21 Nights in Tooting) by nearly six months. There are many in the UK entertainment industry, including Pete Townshend, who feel that Thom's publicist lifted Rachel Fuller's concept and inflated the web statistics to hype Thom's image. Some critics accused Sony of orchestrating the campaign. Craig Logan, the managing director of RCA, denied these accusations, claiming that the label was \\"drawn to\\" Thom after hearing of the webcasting.

The name is a syllabic abbreviation of the two Danish words \\"nordisk\\" (Nordic) and \\"mad\\" (food). Opened in 2003, the restaurant is known for its reinvention and interpretation of the Nordic Cuisine.\\"Nordic Chef Explores Backyard\\". The New York Times. 6 July 2010. In 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014, it was ranked as the Best Restaurant in the World by Restaurant magazine—as of 2019 it is ranked 2nd.. CNN. History Noma's original location was in an old warehouse on the waterfront in the Christianshavn neighbourhood in central Copenhagen. The building is situated by the Greenlandic Trading Square (Danish: Grønlandske Handels Plads), which for 200 years was a centre for trade to and from the Faroe Islands, Finnmark, Iceland, and in particular, Greenland. Dry fish, salted herring, whale oil and skins are among the goods that were stored in and around the warehouse before being sold off to European markets. In 2003, the warehouse was turned into North Atlantic House, a centre for the art and culture of the North Atlantic region. Noma was opened at the same time by Redzepi and Claus Meyer. The restaurant's interior was designed by Space Copenhagen. Between 12 and 16 February 2013, 63 of 435 diners became ill after eating at Noma, according to a Danish Food Administration report. The symptoms were attributed to norovirus, which was believed to have been unintentionally spread by an infected kitchen employee. Redzepi planned to close Noma after 31 December 2016 and reopen it in 2017 as an urban farm near Copenhagen. Noma reopened on 15 February 2018 after a year hiatus. The restaurant itself also moved from its previous Strandgade location, now housing Restaurant Barr, to its current location on Refshalevej. In May 2020, during the COVID-19 crisis, Noma re-opened as a wine and burger bar, with takeaway options. It is sometimes referred as \\"Noma 3.0\\" by the food media. Redzepi plans to keep this open for at least a part of the summer 2020. Food White asparagus with poached egg yolk and sauce of woodruff. The cuisine of Noma is Nordic/Scandinavian; the restaurant's founders René Redzepi and Claus Meyer have attempted to redefine this Nordic cuisine. Its cuisine can be considered more an interpretation of Nordic food than classical Nordic food itself, according to Meyer in the book Noma – Nordic Cuisine. Famous dishes include 'The Hen and the Egg', a meal cooked by the diners themselves which consists of potato chips, a wild duck egg, slightly wet hay, salt, herbs, wild forest plants, hay oil, thyme, butter, and wild ransoms sauce. Staff Redzepi formerly worked at restaurants including The French Laundry, elBulli, Kong Hans Kælder and Le Jardin des Sens. The Chef de cuisine is currently Benjamin Ing. Previously the Chef was Dan Giusti, who took over from Matt Orlando. The head sommelier is Norwegian Mads Kleppe.  Temporary locations  From 28 July to 6 August 2012, Noma decamped to London for a 10-day pop-up restaurant hosted by Claridge's hotel in Mayfair, while the restaurant in Copenhagen was closed from 22 July to 13 August for refurbishment. Redzepi, along with head chef Matt Orlando and staff from the restaurant, served up a £195-per-head nine-course menu that included their versions of scones and clotted cream, Lancashire hotpot with British ingredients, as well as live ants foraged in Denmark and flown to London. On 29 March 2014, Noma announced that the restaurant would be relocating to Japan for two months in the beginning of 2015. On 24 July 2015, Noma announced that the restaurant would be relocating to Australia for 10 weeks in the beginning of 2016. On 12 April 2017, Noma Mexico was opened in Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico. Each multi-course dinner costs US$600. Noma partnered with Traspatio Maya, a nonprofit network of 15 Maya communities to provide Yucatecan ingredients such as white Naal Teel corn, Ixil onions, Xtop pepita, bee larva, and Melipona honey from the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve. Products from the rest of the country are also included, such as Baja California wine, Chiapas coffee and Oaxaca artisanal plateware. The pop-up closed on 28 May.

This came soon after previous first and second place chefs Ferran Adria and Heston Blumenthal announced that they would be temporarily closing their restaurants. At the time, Noma was viewed as the head of a new movement to spread New Nordic cuisine. In 2011, with El Bulli having withdrawn from the competition because they would be permanently closing, Noma was easily named the Best Restaurant for the second straight year. It was selected by a worldwide panel of journalists, chefs, restaurateurs, and food lovers. The restaurant continued its dominance without having earned a third Michelin Star. In 2012, Redzepi won the award for Noma yet again, being praised by Restaurant as being \\"the standard bearer for the New Nordic movement\\" and winning respect for his attention to detail and innovative approach. His use of local and seasonal ingredients foraged from the seashore and forest was also recognized.

Geography Preitenegg lies on the northeastern rim of Carinthia in the upper Lavant valley. The municipality stretches along the slopes of the Packalpe and Koralpe mountain ranges, both part of the Lavanttal Alps. In the east, the Pack Saddle mountain pass marks the boundary with the state of Styria. Due to its picturesque setting, the mountain village today strongly relies on tourism, including cross-country skiing in winter. The municipal area comprises the cadastral communities of Kleinpreitenegg, Oberauerling, Oberpreitenegg, Preitenegg, Unterauerling, and Unterpreitenegg. History St Nicholas parish church From the 11th century onwards, the upper Lavant valley belonged to the Bamberg ecclesiastical estates within the Duchy of Carinthia, ruled by episcopal ministeriales residing at Waldenstein Castle near Wolfsberg. The local St Nicholas Church was first mentioned in 1288, when the bailiwick (Vogtei) passed to the Bishop of Lavant. Preitenegg itself first appeared in a 1328 deed. The linear village arose on the historic country road (Packer Straße), originally only a mule track, that ran from Carinthia across the Pack Saddle to the Styrian capital Graz. In 1695 the Waldenstein estates were acquired by the noble House of Schönborn, in 1852 they passed to Henckel von Donnersmarck family. The present-day municipality was established in 1849. From 1930 to 1936 the Pack Saddle road was upgraded as a Bundesstraße federal highway. Preitenegg later was relieved of heavy traffic by the opening of the parallel Süd Autobahn motorway in the 1980s.

Kauffman and Moss Hart **directed by Damon Kiely History Lawrence Novikoff and Paul Engelhardt founded Strawdog Theatre Company in 1988 after performing together in a production of Euripides's Helen. Strawdog was intended to be a home for a company of actors drawn to a gritty, realistic theater style. The group took their name from Sam Peckinpah's movie \\"Straw Dogs\\" and was founded with the commitment to the ensemble approach, which remains the backbone of Strawdog today . In 2000, the Company went through a period of restructuring. Many ensemble members left the Company and new members were recruited. This personnel change led to a shift in leadership and focus for the ensemble. Jennifer Avery and Michael Dailey took over as Co-Artistic Directors. They added many new ensemble members of varying disciplines, restructured the administration of the Company and gradually moved its focus from gritty kitchen sink dramas to a wider range of styles. In August 2003, the Company hired Nic Dimond, a former ensemble member, to helm the Company as Artistic Director. Strawdog first garnered national attention when Terry Teachout (\\"America's Theatre Critic\\") of The Wall Street Journal named Aristocrats one of the best shows of 2007.

It is based in Stuttgart, Germany, and it has had a major influence in legislation to enshrine sustainability and intergenerational justice in several constitutions in Europe. The FRFG published several books in English, including the Handbook of Intergenerational Justice. FRFG is associated with the United Nations' Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and Department of Public Information (DPI). History In 1997, the organization was founded by a group of European students who worried about the future and wanted to promote intergenerational justice in terms of ecology and economy. To FRFG, intergenerational justice means that today's youth and future generations must have at least the same opportunities to meet their own needs as the generation governing today. Research topics of FRFG include the unprecedented ecological destruction, the pension crisis, what it sees as the disenfranchisement of the young generation, youth unemployment and national indebtedness.(http://www.intergenerationaljustice.org/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=51&Itemid;=78 FRFG History) FRFG has four young board members, whose average age of 30 makes FRFG's board one of the youngest boards of a foundation worldwide. Activities FRFG organized several congresses, symposia and meetings, such as a congress with 330 young decision makers from throughout Europe which took place at the World Exhibition (EXPO) in Hanover in 2000. It publishes books and issues policy papers. FRFG publishes a journal called Intergenerational Justice Review, which reaches many thousand of today’s and future decision makers (Members of Parliament of various European countries, numerous managers, journalists and professors, 3000 students from various fields of study). Through the so-called “Generational Justice Award”, endowed with 10,000 €, young scientists are encouraged to take a close look on issues concerning the future. Numerous politicians asked for FRFG’s advice on questions concerning Generational Justice, among them the German ministers for Work (Reform of the pension scheme), and the minister for Justice (establishment of Generational Justice in the German constitution). Scientific Advisory Council FRFG is supported by a scientific advisory council that includes Dr. Mihajlo Mesarovic (Club of Rome), Dr. Radermacher (Club of Rome), Dr. Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker (Club of Rome), Lord Ralf Dahrendorf (UK House of Lords), Wolfgang Seiler (KIT) and Kennedy Graham (UN University). Awards FRFG received the Theodor-Heuss-Medal and the Medal for Good Citizenship of the town of Oberursel for its engagement.

He was also a substantial land owner in Weobley, Herefordshire, in Ludlow, Shropshire, in Ewyas Lacy in the Welsh Marches, and several lands in Normandy.Colin Veach, Lordship in Four Realms: The Lacy Family, 1166–1241 (Manchester, 2014) He was the eldest son of Hugh de Lacy, a leading Cambro-Norman baron in the Norman invasion of Ireland, and Rohese of Monmouth.  Life  With his father he built Trim Castle () in Trim, County Meath. During the revolt of Prince John Lackland, Lord of Ireland, against his brother, King Richard the Lionheart, in 1193–94, Walter joined with John de Courcy to support Richard. Walter apprehended some knights loyal to John along with Peter Pipard, John's justiciar in Ireland. Walter did homage to Richard for his lands in Ireland in 1194, receiving his lordship of Meath. After mounting the throne of England in 1199, John wrote to his justiciar in Ireland to complain that de Courcy and de Lacy had destroyed John's land of Ireland. Walter had made John his enemy. In 1203, John granted custody of the city of Limerick to Walter's father-in-law, William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber. As de Braose was an absentee, Walter served as de Braose's deputy in Limerick. In 1206–07, Walter became involved in a conflict with Meiler Fitzhenry, Justiciar of Ireland, and Walter's feudal tenants for lands in Meath; Meiler had seized Limerick. King John summoned Walter to appear before him in England in April 1207. After Walter's brother Hugh de Lacy, 1st Earl of Ulster, had taken Meiler FitzHenry prisoner, John in March 1208 acquiesced in giving Walter a new charter for his lands in Meath. Upon his return to Ireland later in 1208, Walter may have acted as Justiciar of Ireland in lieu of the deposed Meiler fitz Henry. By this time, John had begun his infamous persecution of Walter's father-in-law, de Braose, who fled to Ireland. On 20 June 1210, King John landed in Crook, now in Co. Waterford, with his feudal levy and a force of Flemish mercenaries; John marched north through Leinster. When John reached Dublin on 27 or 28 June, Walter attempted to throw himself on John's mercy, sending five of his tenants to Dublin to place his lands in Meath back in the king's hand, and disclaiming any attempt to shelter his brother Hugh from John's wrath. John attacked eastern Meath, and was joined by 400 of Walter's deserting followers. John would hold Walter's lands in Meath for five years. In 1211 Walter erected the castle on Turbet Island in the abortive Anglo- Norman attempt to gain control of West Ulster. Attempting to secure support in Ireland against the brewing revolt that would lead to Magna Carta, John began negotiations to restore Walter to his lands in Meath in the summer of 1215. Walter was Sheriff of Herefordshire from 1218 to 1222. In 1230 he joined with Geoffrey de Marisco and Richard Mór de Burgh to subdue Aedh mac Ruaidri Ó Conchobair, King of Connacht. He was a benefactor to the abbeys of Llanthony and Craswall (Herefordshire) and also founded the abbey of Beaubec in Ireland.

After the mostly indecisive Dawn operations in 1983, Iran opened a new, surprise amphibious offensive in the lakes of the Hawizeh Marshes in Iraqi Tigris–Euphrates river system. After heavy losses at the beginning due to human wave attacks, 15,000 casualties and little progress, Iran began developing new tactics, involving amphibious assault, and deployed a regular army division, the 92nd Armored Division. Although the Iranians suffered heavy losses against the Iraqi artillery, tanks, air strikes and gunboats, Iran eventually managed to invade the oil rich Majnoun Islands with Operation Kheibar and nearly break the Iraqi lines before being driven back to the marshes and Majnoon Island. Iraq heavily used chemical weapons (mustard gas) during the battle. Prelude and Iranian tactics After the mostly indecisive Dawn operations, Iran attempted to change tactics. Iran had launched numerous operations in 1983 around Basra and southern Iraq using massed human wave attacks, but they faced limited successes in the face of the Iraqi static defenses. In addition, the Iraqis began launching counterattacks. In the face of increasing Iraqi armament and manpower as well as increasing problems on their own side, Iran could no longer rely on outnumbering Iraqi troops. While the infantry and human wave assaults would remain key to their attacks throughout the war, Iran began to rely more heavily on deception surprise attacks, as well as light infantry warfare. In contrast to Iraq's static defences and heavy armour, Iran began training troops in infiltration, patrolling, night-fighting, marsh warfare, and mountain warfare. They also began training thousands of Revolutionary Guard commandos in amphibious warfare, as southern Iraq is marshy and filled with wetlands. Iran used speedboats to cross the marshes and rivers in southern Iraq, landing troops on the opposing banks, where they would dig and set up pontoon bridges across the rivers and wetlands to allow heavy troops and supplies to cross. Transport helicopters were used as well, ferrying troops to the battlefield. Unlike Iraq, Iran could no longer use its air force at this stage of the war, so it relied mostly on helicopters to support its troops. The Iranians utilized SEAL type Special Forces from two naval brigades. Four Iranian SEAL battalions were deployed with 2,400 men. The Iranian SEALs regularly conducted hundreds of reconnaissance missions with great success. They often would change into civilian clothing to blend in with the locals and gather information in the enemy rear. More than half these missions were successful providing detailed information on Iraqi defenses even reporting the size of bunker doors.*The Iran-Iraq War Volume 2: Iran Strikes back, June 1982-December 1986 by E.R. Hooton, Tom Cooper, & Farzin Nadimi Iran's amphibious assault tactics, using Boghammar speedboats as landing craft would be decisive during this battle. Iraqi tactics By the end of 1982, Iraq had been resupplied with new Soviet and Chinese materiel, and the ground war entered a new phase. Iraq used newly acquired T-55 tanks and T-62 tanks (as well as Chinese copies), BM-21 rocket launchers, and Mi-24 helicopter gunships to prepare a Soviet-type three-line defense, replete with obstacles, minefields, and fortified positions. The Combat Engineer Corps built bridges across water obstacles, laid minefields, and prepared new defence lines and fortifications. In order to defend Basra, the Iraqis poured water into a pre-existing lake east of Basra, known as Fish Lake, and filled it with barbed wire, floating land mines, and high voltage electrical power lines which electrocuted Iranian soldiers and made the lake practically impenetrable.https://articles.latimes.com/1990-08-14/news/wr-831_1_saddam- hussein They also began launching air raids against Iranian border cities, greatly increasing the practice by 1984. With such static defenses, the Iraqis had effectively made frontal assault through the flat lands virtually impossible for the Iranians. Thus the Iranians would launch their amphibious attacks. Diversionary attacks Prior to the attack, the Iranian commandos on helicopters landed behind Iraqi lines, and even destroyed Iraqi artillery. Iran launched two preliminary attacks prior to the main offensive, Operation Dawn 5 and Dawn 6. They saw the Iranians attempting to capture Al-Amarah, Iraq and sever the highway connecting Baghdad to Basra, which would impede Iraqi coordination of supplies and defences. The area, located on a large waterway, had been considered impenetrable by the Iraqis, but Iranian troops crossed the river using Boghammar speedboats in a surprise attack. However, the Iranian forces only came within of the highway. Afterwards, Iran began Operation Kheibar, the main offensive. Operation Kheibar By 1984, the Iranian ground forces were reorganised well enough for the Revolutionary Guard to start Operation Kheibar, which lasted from 24 February to 19 March. Beginning on 15 February 1984 the Iranians began launching attacks against the central section of the front, where the Second Iraqi Army Corps was deployed, with 250,000 Iraqis facing 250,000 Iranians. Operation Kheibar began on 24 February when Iranian infantrymen crossed the Hawizeh Marshes using speedboats in an amphibious assault. This took the Iraqis by surprise, since the marshes were considered impenetrable, and worse the Iraqi could not use their tanks. The marshes also absorbed the impact of Iraqi artillery and bombs. The Iranians attacked the vital oil-producing Majnoon Island by landing troops by helicopters onto the islands and severed the communication lines between Amarah and Basra. The Iranians continued the attack towards Qurna. Iraqi defences, under continuous strain since 15 February, seemed close to breaking. However, they were saved by their use of chemical weapons and defence-in- depth, where they layered several defensive lines; even if the Iranians broke through the first line, they were usually unable to break through the second due to exhaustion and heavy losses. Iran suffered also from a shortage of aircraft and armour and the infantry had to bear the brunt of the fighting. The Revolutionary Guard also used guerrilla tactics in the marshes blending into the terrain and bypassing the Iraqis. Iranian mounted infantry using motorcycles also pushed deeper into Iraqi lines. The Iraqis heavily used Mi-25 Hind to \\"hunt\\" the Iranian troops in the marshes, killing many soldiers. On 27 February, Iran finally captured Majnoon Island, but lost 49 of their own helicopters shot down by Iraqi jet fighters. Fighting took place in waters over 2 meters deep at times. Iraq in response to the attacks ran live electrical cables through the water, electrocuting numerous Iranian troops and then displaying their corpses on state television. By 29 February, they had reached the outskirts of Qurna and nearly reached the Baghdad-Basra highway. But by this time, the Iranians had broken out of the marshes and returned to open terrain, and were confronted by the conventional Iraqi forces including artillery, tanks and air power, and also mustard gas as well. 1,200 Iranian troops were killed in the counterattack. The Iranians were forced to retreat back to the marshes, however they still held onto them along with Majnoon Island. Approximately 40,000 Iranians became casualties during the fighting in the marshes, with Iraqi helicopter gunships being deployed to \\"hunt\\" the Iranian troops through the swampy land. The Iranians also used combined helicopter and riverboat operations as part of this attack, known as the Fatima al-Zahra operations (named after the daughter of Muhammad), charting and mapping all of the marshes. Aftermath Although the Iranians suffered much greater losses, their large numbers and religious fervor enabled them to continue. Iraq's 5000 dead, on the other hand, was an unacceptable battle toll. Iraq was relying on Soviet tanks and artillery and air support. Iran, with more than three times the size and population of Iraq, relied on sheer numbers, religious zeal and self-sacrifice due to turmoil caused by the recent revolution that negatively affected the amount of military organization, trade, supplies, and military hardware. The operation inspired other successful amphibious operations by Iran later in the war, including Operation Dawn-8 during which Iran captured the Faw Peninsula.

This is a sinusoid (a pure tone) with an amplitude envelope which is a scaled gamma distribution function. Different ways of motivating the gammatone filter for auditory processing have been presented by Johannesma, Patterson et al., Hewitt and Meddis, and Lindeberg and Friberg.

During the Republican era, the four regiones of the city of Rome were subdivided into vici. In the 1st century BC, Augustus reorganized the city for administrative purposes into 14 regions, comprising 265 vici.Paul Zoch, Ancient Rome: An Introductory History (University of Oklahoma Press, 1998), p. 233; Paul Zanker, The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus (University of Michigan Press, 1988), p. 155. Each vicus had its own board of officials who oversaw local matters. These administrative divisions are recorded as still in effect at least until the mid-4th century.As recorded in the regionary catalogues; Andrew Wallace-Hadrill, \\"Emperors and Houses in Rome,\\" in Childhood, Class, and Kin in the Roman World (Routledge, 2001), and \\"Domus and insulae in Rome: Families and Housefuls,\\" in Early Christian Families in Context: An Interdisciplinary Dialogue (Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2003). The Latin word vicus was also applied to the smallest administrative unit of a provincial town within the Roman Empire. It is also notably used today to refer to an ad hoc provincial civilian settlement that sprang up close to and because of a nearby military fort or state-owned mining operation. Local government in Rome Each vicus elected four local magistrates (vicomagistri) who commanded a sort of local police force chosen from among the people of the vicus by lot. Occasionally the officers of the vicomagistri would feature in certain celebrations (primarily the Compitalia) in which they were accompanied by two lictors.Oxford Classical Dictionary, Vicus. Ad hoc settlements These vici differed from the planned civilian towns (civitates), which were laid out as official, local economic and administrative centres, the coloniae, which were settlements of retired troops, or the formal political entities created from existing settlements, the municipia. Unplanned, and originally lacking any public administrative buildings, vici had no specific legal status (unlike other settlements) and often developed in order to profit from the presence of Roman troops. As with most garrison towns, they provided entertainment and supplies for the troops, but many also developed significant industries, especially metal and glass working. Some vici seem not to have had direct connections to troop placement (e.g., the Vicus Martis Tudertium). Vici is the term used for the extramural settlements of forts for military units (e.g. alae and cohorts), while canabae is generally used to describe extramural settlements of the major legionary fortresses (e.g. Eboracum, Vindobona, Durostorum).Roman Towns of Britain, Guy de la Bedoyere. p 146 Initially ephemeral, many vici were transitory sites that followed a mobile unit; once a permanent garrison was established they grew into larger townships. Often the number of official civitates and coloniæ were not enough to settle everyone who wished to live in a town and so vici also attracted a wider range of residents, with some becoming chartered towns where no other existed nearby. Some, such as that at Vercovicium (Housesteads), outgrew their forts altogether, especially in the 3rd century once soldiers were permitted to marry. Early vici had no civilian administration and were under the direct control of the Roman military commander. Those that attracted significant numbers of Roman citizens were later permitted to form local councils and some, such as the vicus at Eboracum (York), grew into regional centres and even provincial capitals. Modern placenames The Latin term, pronounced with an initial 'u', was adopted into Old English as wic, wick, wich, or wych. It became one of the most widely occurring common placename elements, e.g. Wyck, Hackney Wick, Gatwick, Exwick, Wickham, Aldwych, Dulwich, Ipswich, Norwich, and indirectly York, from Eoforwic via Old Norse Jorvik. In the Brittonic languages, the cognate word is gwig in Welsh and Cornish and guic in Breton; all now meaning \\"village\\". In continental languages, the term became Old High German wih \\"village\\", Modern German Weichbild \\"municipal area\\", Dutch wijk \\"quarter, district\\", Old Frisian wik, Old Saxon wic \\"village\\".

He is best known in modern science for his pioneering experiments in the field of endocrinology. He published works on herpetology, ornithology, entomology and chemistry. Early life and education Berthold was the second-youngest of six children. His father was a carpenter and his family was not wealthy. He went to the local gymnasium (equivalent to a grammar school) where he studied the classics but was most interested in natural history. He followed his older brother's example to study medicine at University of Göttingen in August 1819. His thesis was under the direction of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752–1840) and he qualified on 10 September 1823. Career He remained at Göttingen for a year before doing a tour of other universities and clinics, which included meeting Johann Lukas Schönlein. In 1825, Berthold decided to practise medicine in Berlin and began experimenting on the effects of coal gas and mercury on the body. Unsettled, he continued to tour Germany and Franc, attending the lectures of other contemporary luminaries Georges Cuvier, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and André Marie Constant Duméril. He forwent the idea of private medical practice and wrote a paper on the thyroid gland of the parrot. He returned to his alma mater as a privatdozent in medicine and began to teach physiology; he spent the rest of his career there. He was appointed as an extraordinary professor in 1835 and a full professor in 1836. In 1840, he was made zoological director of the museum. He published on the topics of the duration of pregnancy, hair growth, myopia and hermaphroditism. In 1829, he published Lehrbuch der Physiologie des Menschen und der Thiere (Textbook on the physiology of humans and animals) which was reprinted a number of times. He collaborated with Robert Bunsen in 1834 to develop the usage of hydrated iron oxide as an antidote for arsenic poisoning. Berthold and assumed, essentially, the leadership of the teaching of anatomy and physiology over the ageing Blumenbach. In 1840, Blumenbach died and his role was taken over by Rudolf Wagner (Berthold wrote a 20-page section on the topic of sexual physiology in a dictionary on physiology that Wagner edited). Berthold taught and encouraged the young Carl Bergmann (anatomist), who became known for experiments on thermoregulation and who coined the terms poikilotherm and homeotherm. Experiments in endocrinology Some of Berthold's previous publications were specifically linked to glands. Scientists up until the 19th century had little idea how glands affected the body. Castrati - men who were castrated before puberty - were kept in harems to ensure females remained chaste; from the middle ages boys were castrated to keep youthful-sounding singing voices due to the lack of an Adam's apple, but in adulthood they also kept a straight hairline, grew large chests and unusually long limbs. Whole-body effects were similarly clear in animals: castrated cock chickens (capons) did not develop the typical male secondary sexual characteristics, namely aggression, crowing, muscle development, sexual proclivity and most visibly the cockscomb and wattle; they were docile and developed tender flesh, which was considered a delicacy. On 8 February 1849, Berthold spoke at the Royal Scientific Society in Göttingen. He described how he'd taken six cock chickens and removed the testes from four of them. The two uncastrated birds continued to develop normally. The other birds remained without male characteristics. Crucially, however, Berthold reprised an experiment that he knew John Hunter had tried with unclear results before 1771 with hens. He transplanted testes back into the abdomens of two of the castrated birds but in a different location; the remasculated birds progressed to develop secondary sexual characteristics, indicating that the testes functioned effectively normally. Upon autopsy, he found that the transplanted testes had grown a new vasculature but no other bodily connection: this finally demonstrated that whatever was controlling the secondary characteristics was transported from the testes via the bloodstream. The prevailing theory, that sexual characteristics were mediated via the nervous system, was thus disproved. Despite this ground-breaking result, Berthold abandoned completely any further developmental work in this field and his contemporaries also showed little interest. The non-reductionist philosophy prevalent amongst physiologists at Göttingen might have coloured their thinking; Rudolph Wagner repeated the experiment without success, and perhaps this also had an effect. No major progress was made until five decades later with some dramatic successes in the treatment of thyroid-based illnesses by Victor Horsley and, soon after, his student George Murray. Legacy Berthold is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of snake, Simoselaps bertholdi.

His father and mother were Atanasije and Zorka Nastić and the family attended the St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church of Gary, Indiana which is now located in Merrillville, Indiana was the place where Varnava was baptized, served as altar boy, and was first recognized as a youthful prodigy in reciting Serbian folklore and old ballads. When Vojislav was a child, his parents returned to their homeland. Vojislav attended high school in Sarajevo, graduating in 1933. He continued his education at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Orthodox Theology, graduating in 1937. After graduating he taught as a catechist in two high schools in Sarajevo. In 1940, Vojislav took monastic vows in Mileševa Monastery, receiving the name Varnava. Varnava was ordained hierodeacon by Metr. Petar of Dabar-Bosna. Dn. Varnava remained in Sarajevo during World War II. Croatian fascists, however, tried to force him to join the \\"Croatian Orthodox Church\\" which they had organized to subvert the Serbian population in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Dn. Varnava categorically refused this. Soon he had to leave Sarajevo in order to save his life. After war he was ordained hieromonk and raised to the rank of protosyncellus by Bp. Nektarije of Zvornik and Tuzla. In its first regular session, the Holy Assembly of the Serbian Orthodox Church elected Fr. Varnava auxiliary bishop to the Serbian Patriarch with the title Bishop of Hvosno, with the responsibility of administering the Diocese of Dabar-Bosna. On August 28, 1947, he received the episcopal consecration by the hands of Patriarch Gavrilo, Bp. Nektarije, and by Bp. Vikentije of Zletovo and Strumica. In his new position Bp. Varnava began openly criticizing the new communist regime for mistreating the church. He was soon arrested and sentenced to twenty years in prison. To support the accusation that he was an American spy, it was presented as evidence that he was teaching his sister English so she could be used as a spy for the Americans. Bp. Varnava was subjected to torture, lack of food, and was kept in the most isolated wing of the prison. But Bp. Varnava remained calm. Every day he sang the troparia and other hymns. The communist Government even arranged an accident in order to get rid of him in which he broke his leg. Although the communist secret police, OZNA, did not allow doctors to provide him any medical help, he recovered. He was released after accident to house arrest in the Gomionica Monastery in the Diocese of Banja Luka until his release in 1960. He died on November 12, 1964, in suspicious circumstances, leading some historians to believe that he was poisoned by OZNA. In 2005, during the regular session of the Bishops' Council of the Serbian Orthodox Church Bishop Varnava was canonized and his name was added to the list of other saints of the Serbian people and of Orthodox Christian faith.

It later morphed into the Department of Employment.Jon Davis \\"Employment, Department of (1970–95)\\" in John Ramsden (ed) The Oxford Companion to British Politics, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.222 Most of its functions are now performed by the Department for Work and Pensions. History After the New Ministries and Secretaries Act 1916 the Ministry of Labour took over Board of Trade responsibilities for conciliation, labour exchanges, labour and industrial relations and employment related statistics. Following the First World War it supervised the demobilisation and resettlement of ex-servicemen. In the 1920s it took over all Board of Education work relating to youth employment and responsibility for training and employment of the disabled from the Ministry of Pensions. It also supervised trade union regulations. Under the Trade Boards Act 1918 the Ministry enforced the minimum wage, helped establish joint industrial councils, and set up the Industrial Court in 1919 for arbitration of industrial disputes. It proposed multiple Unemployment Insurance Acts amendments, administered benefits through employment exchanges, employed the unemployed through special works schemes (through the Unemployment Grants Committee), and represented the UK at the International Labour Organization from 1919). From 1939, the department was renamed the Ministry of Labour and National Service, reflecting new duties under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939. It allocated people to work between the armed forces, civil defence and industry, and to administer the Schedule of Reserved Occupations. The National Joint Advisory Council, comprising employers' and workers' representatives, was consulted. From 1941, one Deputy Secretary for the Ministry controlled peacetime work, and another coordinated work on manpower statistics, intelligence, armed forces recruitment, civilian war work and training and labour supply. In April 1945, functions relating to unemployment insurance and assistance were transferred to the Ministry of National Insurance, but the Ministry of Labour retained responsibility for employment exchanges. In June 1945, the Board of Trade was handed responsibility for industrial policy, except that concerning labour power. At the end of the War, the National Service Department wing was wound up and its functions passed to the Military Recruitment Department. In 1947 the ministry introduced the Control of Engagement Order, 1947, which limited the rights of workers to leave various industries, and gave labour exchanges the right to direct the unemployed to specific jobs. In 1959 the department became the Ministry of Labour once more. It was renamed the Department of Employment and Productivity in 1968, and became the Department for Employment in 1970.

He was active as a missionary among the emigrated Uniates in the northeastern United States before being ordered back to Europe 1914. He was to become vicar of the congregation of the Russian Embassy in Berlin. Because of the outbreak of the First World War he was instead nominated as vicar of the Orthodox congregation in Helsinki, Finland, then a part of imperial Russia. In 1917 he was assigned to Christ the Savior Cathedral in Moscow. After the Bolshevik coup he was subjected to many cruelties by the revolutionaries as he defended the Orthodox faith, his people, and church property. Subjected to many arrests and exile Father Alexander served his Church as best he could through these tumultuous times until after a final arrest he was executed during the Great Purge on August 19, 1937. His glorification is celebrated on December 4. Missionary in the United States Altar fresco of Saint Alexander Hotovitzky in Russian St. Nicholas Cathedral (New York, NY) Alexander Hotovitzky was born on February 11, 1872, in the city of Kremenets in Volhynia (now Ukraine). His father, Alexander, was a priest who was the rector of the Volhynia Theological Seminary. Fr. Alexander was educated at the Volhynia Seminary before entering the St. Petersburg Theological Academy. Upon graduation from the academy in 1895 with a master's degree he was sent to the Diocese of the Aleutians and North America as a lay missionary and as reader at the St. Nicholas Church in New York City. He was ordained a deacon after his marriage to Maria Scherbuhina, who was a graduate of the Pavlosk Institute of St. Petersburg. Bishop Nicholas Ziorov ordained Fr. Alexander to the priesthood on February 25, 1896, at the diocesan cathedral in San Francisco.\\"New-Hieromartyr Alexander Alexandrovich (Hotovitsky)\\", Holy Trinity Cathedral A week later he returned to New York to become the pastor of St. Nicholas Church (New York, NY), where he had been a reader. During the ensuing years, Fr. Alexander was successful in his missionary activities among the emigrees from Galicia and Carpatho-Russia as well as representing the Orthodox Church before American religious institutions and meetings. He was instrumental in the establishment of many new Orthodox parishes, including those in Yonkers, Passaic, Philadelphia, and Watervliet.\\"Parish Background\\", St.Basil's Russian Orthodox Church, Watervliet, New York He edited the journal of Orthodox activity, the American Orthodox Messenger. He actively participated in establishing an Orthodox mutual aid society (ROCMAS), including serving in various management positions. Through his initiative and active participation, a new architecturally majestic St. Nicholas Cathedral was built to replace the small parish church in New York City. He traveled throughout the United States, and even to Russia, soliciting funds for its construction. Tzar Nicholas contributed 5,000 rubles.\\"History of Saint Nicholas Cathedral\\", Russian Orthodox Church in the United States of America In 1903, the new edifice became the diocesan cathedral. The treaty to end the Russo-Japanese war was negotiated through the initiative of President Theodore Roosevelt. The negotiations and signing took place in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Fr Alexander was among the Orthodox clergy who traveled to Portsmouth for the occasion, where a service of Thanksgiving was held in Christ Church. Archpriest Fr. Alexander sang a solemn \\"Te Deum\\"; also participating were choristers from St. Nicholas Cathedral.\\"Christ Church Service\\", Portsmouth Peace Treaty For eighteen years he served in America under Bishop Nicholas; the future Patriarch of Moscow, St. Tikhon; and Archbishop Platon; the now Archpriest Alexander was recalled to Russia on February 26, 1914. Russia and Martyrdom After his arrival in the Russian Empire Fr. Alexander was appointed rector of the Orthodox congregation in Helsinki; then a part of the Russian Empire, now Finland. Here, as assistant to the archbishop of Finland, Sergius (Stragorodsky), later Patriarch Sergius I of Moscow, he defended the Orthodox minority against the proselytizing activities of the Finnish Lutherans. The crypt chapel of the Uspenski Cathedral in Helsinki is today named after him. Then in August 1917 he was transferred to Christ the Savior Church in Moscow as an assistant priest to once again serve under his old archpastor from America, the future St. Tikhon. He arrived as two historic events were to unfold, the All-Russian Church Council of 1917-1918 and the Bolshevik coup of October 1917. He was an active participant in the Church Council and assisted St. Tikhon in the administration of the Moscow diocese. With the loss of state funding, the Church and the Cathedral had to look to other sources of funds. Fr. Alexander's activities defending the Church naturally brought upon him the enmity of the Bolsheviks and led to his arrest for brief periods in May 1920 and November 1921 for violating government decrees concerning religion.Forbes, Marina. \\"New Martyr Alexander Hotovitsky was in Portsmouth for 1905 Treaty Signing\\", Orthodox Christianity, December 8, 2010 Fr. Alexander, with Fr. Nicholas Arseniev, the rector of Christ the Savior Cathedral, aided the establishment of a brotherhood that appealed to the Orthodox flock to defend and preserve the Cathedral, and to aid the starving. In 1922, the next stage of Bolshevik antagonism began as Church property, including icons and sacred vessels, were confiscated on the pretext of helping the poor and starving. Although St. Tikhon encouraged the Church's donation of funds for this purpose, this was not enough for the Bolsheviks. So, St. Tikhon issued a decree based on canon law that the clergy in Russia were not to surrender sacred vessels for non-ecclesiastical use. This brought St. Tikhon's arrest and numerous court trials in which the servants of the Church were accused of counter-revolutionary activity. These trials intensified the Bolshevik attacks and the increased shedding of blood of the clergy and faithful who defended the Church. Fr. Alexander was in the forefront of those who implemented the Patriarch's instructions. He took part in meetings to draft a resolution for a general parish meeting of Christ the Savior parish about the state decrees. This resolution, drafted by Fr. Alexander, was presented at a general meeting of the parish by Archpriest Nicholas Arseniev on March 23, 1922. Fr. Alexander had already been placed under arrest. The final resolution contained demands of guarantees from the state that all donations from the Church would be used for saving the lives of the starving. However, the drafting of this resolution was considered a further example of counter-revolutionary activity. This led to further trials and executions of hieromartyrs and martyrs. Then a new high-visibility trial was convened in Moscow on November 27, 1922, during which 105 clergy and laity were accused of \\"attempting to retain in their hands possession of church valuables and, through the resulting starvation, to topple the Soviet Regime.\\" In this trial the state prosecution portrayed Fr. Alexander as a central figure in the activities surrounding the preparation of the resolution. Under questioning, Fr. Alexander did not admit to wrongdoing and tried to protect the other defendants. In his final words as a defendant, Fr. Alexander defended the meeting as an ordinary meeting without any counter-revolutionary intent. On December 13, 1922, the verdicts were announced. As a surprise the penalties were milder than earlier bloody verdicts.\\"Glorification of the Priestmartyr Alexander Hotovitzky\\", Orthodox Church in America Fr. Alexander and two others were given ten-year sentences in prison, loss of their personal property, and loss of civil rights for five years. The others were given lesser sentences, but appeals for pardons were turned down by the Supreme Central Executive Committee on February 16, 1923. Then, surprisingly, in October 1923, Fr. Alexander and others were granted amnesty. However, despite his freedom he was not assigned to a parish but served by invitation in Moscow churches. Then on September 4, 1924, the State Political Directorate recommended administrative exile of thirteen clergy and church leaders including Fr. Alexander. After further interrogation, Fr. Alexander was exiled to the northern Turukhan region of Siberia for three years. After his return from exile, he was elevated to the rank of protopresbyter and was assigned as an assistant to the Deputy Locum-Tenens of the Patriarchal Throne, Metropolitan Sergius. In the 1930s, he went on to serve as rector of the Church of the Deposition of the Robe on Donskoy Street. Then in the summer of 1937, Fr. Alexander was again arrested. He was sentenced to death and shot on August 19, 1937. Fr. Alexander is buried in Donskoye Cemetery in Moscow. Veneration Fr.

The term can also be used for non- academic training for a specific profession. Professional studies usually combine theory and practice-based professional learning, focusing on a body of knowledge that is more strictly delineated and canonical than non-professional studies. Students are trained to ensure expected standards and adequate service delivery in the best practice of a profession. Professional studies may lead to academic degrees such as the Bachelor of Professional Studies (BPS), Master of Professional Studies (MPS), or Doctor of Professional Studies (DPS). A BPS is similar to a Bachelor of General Studies with a greater emphasis on practical and technical training (and a corresponding lower emphasis on liberal arts), and therefore of greater interest to mid-career students.

Originally and typically, it refers to victims of Islamic persecution.. The earliest source to use the term neomartys is the Narrationes of Anastasius of Sinai, who died around 700. The title continued to be used for the next three hundred years to refer to victims of Umayyad and Abbasid persecution. It was mainly used in Greek sources, but is occasionally found in Arabic, Georgian and Syriac sources. Between the 11th and 14th centuries, the Byzantine–Seljuq wars also generated a number of neomartyrs.

They were instrumental in the rise of the electroclash movement in the UK with their breakthrough single \\"Me and Madonna\\". Originally producing in the house genre, they later became more influenced by music from the 1970s and 1980s, especially industrial post punk and European electronic body music. They describe their sound as \\"frozen balearic gay biker house\\". They are heavily influenced by acts such as Cabaret Voltaire, Nitzer Ebb, Front 242, and Depeche Mode. The group's members are in high demand as remixers, and worked with such diverse artists as Röyksopp, Nitzer Ebb, Rammstein, The Rapture, and Tiefschwarz. Ivan Smagghe left in 2006 as Black Strobe expanded to a four- piece live band, with members David \\"Siskid\\" Shaw (guitar), Bastien Burger (bass and keyboard), and Benjamin Beaulieu (drums) joining Rebotini on vocals. Smagghe was contributing lyrics before his departure. They released their debut album Burn Your Own Church in 2007. Two songs from Burn Your Own Church have appeared in other forms of media. \\"I'm A Man\\" appeared in the 2008 film RocknRolla, the 2009 film Le Mac, and the second episode of the AMC series The Walking Dead. It was also copied without permission and used in the 2010 Bollywood film Once Upon a Time in Mumbai. \\"Shining Bright Star\\" was featured in the Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood multiplayer launch trailer. In 2013, their track \\"Boogie in Zero Gravity\\" was featured on Radio Mirror Park in Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto V. In 2009, after remixing other music artists' tracks, Black Strobe released the EP Back From Beyond, which was accompanied in early 2010 by a video directed by Laurent Chanez, whom the group had met in 2004 through the Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRM).

One of his brothers, His Honour Judge Michael Baker, QC, was the Resident Judge at St Alban's Crown Court.

In February 1976, at the relaunch of the Volvo 66 (formerly the DAF 66), it was announced that the DAF 46 would be phased out during 1976, after which 'special measures' would ensure adequate parts and service backup despite the disappearance of the DAF brand from passenger car show rooms. The DAF 46 was carpeted throughout and equipped with cloth covered reclining seats. It also had a redesigned gear lever and additional dash mounted warning lights. Out of sight of the driver was a de Dion rear axle, which DAF had fitted two years earlier to their more powerful model when replacing the 55 with the DAF 66: the car retained its defining variomatic transmission, but this was now coupled with a conventional differential which was said to improve noise levels and extend drive-belt life. Reports suggest that the DAF 46 had safer handling than its predecessor, but acceleration was nonetheless considerably slower, at a time when most European manufacturers were improving top speed and acceleration when they introduced model upgrades.

Its subject is Victoria Woodhull, the 19th-century woman who with her sister were the first women to operate a brokerage firm, at which they became millionaires; and started a newspaper. Woodhull was a proponent for free love and activist for equality of the sexes. Its cast of characters includes Cornelius Vanderbilt, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, restaurateur Charlie Delmonico, and Henry Ward Beecher, with whom Woodhull is linked in a fictional romance that leads to the minister being tried for alienation of affections. This musical originated in 1979 as Unescorted Women, first produced off-off-Broadway by the Joseph Jefferson Theatre Company. With its budget sets and costumes, anachronistic pop score, and camp burlesque-style production numbers (including one in which Woodhull sang the praises of Beecher's physical endowment) intact, headed uptown the following year rechristened Onward Victoria. After twenty-three previews - and with its closing notice already in place - the Broadway production, directed by Julianne Boyd and choreographed by Michael Shawn, opened on December 14, 1980 at the Martin Beck Theatre, where it ran for one performance. The cast included Jill Eikenberry as Woodhull, Michael Zaslow as Beecher, Ted Thurston as Vanderbilt, Laura Waterbury as Stanton, Dorothy Holland as Anthony, Gordon Stanley as Fleming, and Lenny Wolpe as Delmonico.

Luckey (born October 7, 1965) is an American writer, director and producer, primarily of animated works. He also writes and illustrates children's books and Bible studies. Luckey has produced over 300 hours of programming and was most notably a producer on the 1980s-'90's animated TV series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (which earned five Emmy nominations) and Adventures from the Book of Virtues. He is also the author and illustrator of the children's book series Spin & Sparkle. He is the son of director, animator and voice actor Bud Luckey (1934–2018) and a maternal cousin, twice removed, of Animator Earl Hurd (1880–1940) who co-created (with J.R. Bray) and patented the process for Cel Animation—a key component of traditional animation. Early work Luckey learned the craft of animation in his family's studio in San Francisco under his father, animator Bud Luckey. That studio produced numerous animated and combined live-animated television commercials and short films for The Children's Television Workshop's (now known as Sesame Workshop) series Sesame Street. Following high school, Luckey briefly worked as a Visual Effects Designer for the Mill Valley, California, based studio Audio Vision Projects. His most notable work there was co-designing, with famed Cinematographer Katsuya Ushino, the visual effects for the MTV music video of \\"Turn of the Century\\" featuring the Atlantic Records progressive British rock group Yes and vocalist Jon Anderson. The video was the directorial debut of Brian G. Smith who later came to fame as a director of fantasy sci-fi films. High school and undergraduate education Luckey initially attended The Admiral Farragut Academy but left after his first year to return to a civilian high school in Marin County, California. He had an initial ambition to pursue a career as a Naval Officer. After making an early departure from Redwood High School in the Spring of 1983, Redwood High School being a notably unusual institution made famous by the comedy routines of fellow alumnus, comedian Robin Williams (Class of '69), Luckey proceeded to The College of Marin – also an alma mater and occasional comedy fodder for Robin Williams. Willams and Luckey attended both schools over a decade apart and have only met casually on a handful of occasions, most of which were unrelated to either school. Luckey is an acquaintance of former San Francisco Mayor and current California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom who was two years behind him at Redwood High School. Newsome was a star baseball player for the school and Luckey an avid baseball fan. Luckey initially enrolled as a pre-med/biology student but decided in his third semester to move to film making and screenwriting. \\"The hell that is 'O-Chem' (organic chemistry) drove me from premed to film school and, in so doing, probably saved countless lives\\", Luckey told the College of Marin school newspaper in a 1984 survey on why people changed majors. In 1986, Luckey continued on to the California State University Northridge, entering what was then known as the Radio-Television Film (RTVF) program of the university's College of Arts and Professional Studies (CAPS). In the early 2000s the school was renamed after alumnus Mike Curb, a former Lieutenant Governor of California and record mogul founder of Curb Records. There Luckey was primarily mentored by his Faculty Advisor Alan Armer, the founding President of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences and Producer of the 1960s series The Untouchables and The Fugitive and the 70s series Cannon. Another key influence on Luckey was screenwriter-producer Benjamin Brady, the former President of ABC Television who had produced the series Perry Mason and co-created, with Raymond Burr, the series Ironside. Luckey also studied under such industry veterans as Nat Perrin (The Adams Family), Tom Burrows (director of the '60 Kennedy-Nixon TV debate), Peter Stearn( Happy Days, The Partridge Family), Beretta and Dr. Kildare writer-producer Irv Pearlberg and Academy Award (Oscar)-winning writer-director Sydney Salkow who, despite his work on over 75 feature films, was best known as the producer of Lassie, I Love Lucy and its follow-up The Lucy Show. Luckey received his B.A. in Radio-Television- Film, Media Management in 1988. Luckey is a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity, Iota Upsilon chapter, which he joined at California State University, Northridge in 1986. He remains an active Sigma Nu Alumnus. Licensing and merchandising Following graduation, Luckey worked for a time as the Los Angeles office's Assistant Branch Manager for The Sunrise Company, KK of Japan. In that role he co-managed Japanese licensing of various western properties for the Asian market including The Simpsons, The Adventures of Tintin, Lone Wolf and Cub, Jean Giraud—a/k/a Moebius and the properties of George Lucas's Lucasfilm, Ltd.. Luckey also managed product placement of Japanese products in U.S. films—most notably the placement of JVC's products in the Back to the Future and Beverly Hills Cop film series as well as the films Days of Thunder and Black Rain. Murakami Wolf Swenson – and The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles From 1989 to 1992, Luckey worked as a producer for the Burbank, California, and Dublin, Ireland studios of Murakami Wolf Swenson—the studio run by veteran animators Jimmy Murakami and Fred Wolf. That studio was later renamed Fred Wolf Films. Luckey's most notable work during that time was on the animated TV series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, based on the Mirage Studios comics by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, and \\"Five Decades with The Chimpmunks, Rockin Through the Years\\" – featuring Ross Bagdasarian's characters of David Seville and the Chimpmunks—Alvin, Simon and Theodore—sometimes known as Alvin and the Chipmunks. Connection to PIXAR's Toy Story character Andy Davis Ralph Guggenheim, producer of the 1995 animated feature Toy Story said in interviews to Animation Magazine and other publications that the Toy Story character Andy Davis was named after and based on Andy Luckey, whose father Bud Luckey was a character designer and story artist on all three films. The \\"Davis\\" purportedly came from The University of California, Davis of which many of the technology personnel on the film were alumni. Andy Luckey has declined to publicly comment on the connection. Video games From 1992 to 1998, Luckey was involved in the video game industry including stints as a Director and Executive Producer for Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Interactive, President and chief operating officer of Pure Interactive Entertainment and Principal and Executive Producer- Interactive for The Krislin Company. Luckey's most notable work of this time was the video game derivative of Walt Disney's Aladdin which was co-produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and Virgin Interactive. Luckey continues to be active in advising on video game production and is an active member of the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) as well as ACM/SIGGRAPH—The Association of Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group in Graphics and Interactive Technology. ACM/SIGGRAPH named him a Computer Graphics Pioneer Member in 2007. Seminary and ministry From 1998 to 2001 Luckey took a self-imposed sabbatical to earn a Master of Divinity, M.Div, degree from Biola University's Talbot School of Theology. He worked as a Youth Pastor and College and Career Pastor during that time for several churches in Southern California. Symaxxis, Inc. From 2001 to 2003 Luckey served as the interim chief executive and as a Corporate Director of Symaxxis, Inc. along with that company's co-founder Geoffrey Mark, who served as Chief Visionary Officer. Symaxxis, Inc. is a Los Angeles-based biometric science company. He left those positions upon forming Greater Family, LLC in 2003. Greater Family, LLC and Greater Family Press Greater Family, LLC was formed in 2003 with Andy Luckey as a co-founder and President. It is a family oriented media company headquartered in Ridgefield, Connecticut—a suburb of New York City Industry speaking and writing Luckey is a frequent speaker at industry events including SIGGRAPH and The Game Developer's Conference. Luckey has co-authored and co-edited two white papers for the International Game Developer's Association, IGDA. The first of which was on Intellectual Property Rights for Game Developers and the second on Quality of Life in the Game Industry. Both white papers are available free of charge at .

History For many years, WJYW \\"Joy 107\\" in Southport, North Carolina, played beautiful music. The format had a negative reputation as one intended only for older listeners, intended only as background music. In February 1986, Will Bowen became WJYW station manager, and soon the station was successful with a new version of easy listening music, with \\"ultra-contemporary\\" from Bonneville Broadcasting replacing \\"matched flow\\". The target audience was 25-54, with more vocals and more instrumental versions of newer songs. The station also had more live DJs. Bowen said, \\"We're not an easy listening station. We're a radio station that happens to play easy listening music.\\" In 1986, the \\"Year of Relaxation\\" won WJYW a national award for creativity. Owner Atlantic Broadcasting, which took over the station when it was having problems, asked for a power increase from 3,000 to 50,000 watts. By this time, the station offices were in Wilmington. In the late 1980s, WJYW changed its name to WSFM \\"Surf 107.5\\", and changed its format to album oriented rock. During the 1990s, Surf 107.5 changed to modern rock.

His books included the novels The Girls from Planet 5 (1955); 30-Day Wonder (1960); and And Then the Town Took Off (1960); and the collections Those Idiots from Earth (1957) and Time Out for Tomorrow (1962). His short stories included \\"The Eight Billion\\" (nominated for a Nebula Award as Best Short Story in 1965); \\"Mother to the World\\" (nominated for the Hugo for Best Novelette in 1969 and winner of the Nebula in 1968); and \\"The Story Writer\\" (nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novella in 1979). Wilson also worked in the public relations field as director of the Syracuse University News Bureau from 1964 to 1980. In 1980 he became the University's senior editor before retiring in 1982. He died March 29, 1987. His other major contribution to science fiction and to Syracuse University was in successfully recruiting the donation of papers from many prominent science fiction writers to the University's George Arents Research Library. As part of this effort, Wilson wrote an article entitled \\"Syracuse University's Science Fiction Collections\\" for the May 1967 issue of the magazine Worlds of Tomorrow. The collection eventually included manuscripts, galley proofs, magazines, correspondence and art donated by Piers Anthony, Hal Clement, Keith Laumer, Larry Niven, Frederik Pohl and others, including Wilson himself. Initially housed in a warehouse annex, the papers eventually made their way to the climate-controlled top floor of Ernest Stevenson Bird Library on the Syracuse University campus.

Following a two-year investigation by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), the site was shut down on 23 October 2007, by British and Dutch police agencies. These music industry organisations described OiNK as an \\"online pirate pre-release music club\\", whereas former users described it as one of the world's largest and most meticulously maintained online music repositories. About a month before the shut-down, music magazine Blender elected OiNK's creator, British software engineer Alan Ellis, to their The Powergeek 25 — the Most Influential People in Online Music list. Alan Ellis was tried for conspiracy to defraud at Teesside Crown court, the first person in the UK to be prosecuted for illegal file-sharing, and found not guilty on 15 January 2010. Background OiNK was an invitation- only BitTorrent community, with about 180,000 members. When closed by the authorities, the site had stored about 200,000 torrent files. One of OiNK's rules was that users could not pay to gain membership to the site, but had an opportunity to donate money to the site. Members were required to maintain minimum upload-to-download ratios, and to have cute avatars. OiNK placed an emphasis on the sharing of torrents for high-quality MP3 and lossless audio formats such as FLAC, along with other formats such as Ogg Vorbis and M4A. The torrents for E-books, computer software, and e-learning videos were also routinely shared amongst OiNK's users. Shut-down and media response OiNK's main page immediately after closure Following a joint operation codenamed Operation Ark Royal, between Interpol, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), and some other organisations, on 23 October 2007 the site was closed. The site's creator, Alan Ellis, was arrested by British police, and Dutch police confiscated OiNK's hosting service company NForce's servers. The e-mail addresses of the site's members were not encrypted and were therefore available to the authorities; however, members' passwords were only stored as a salted md5 hash. Data stored on OiNK's servers was insufficient to incriminate OiNK users.Police, IFPI make bacon of Oink BitTorrent tracker Jeremy Banks, head of the IFPI's Internet Anti-Piracy Unit, opined that OiNK was central to the illegal distribution of pre-release music, and that the site had leaked over 60 major album releases in 2007. The shut-down was covered in media worldwide mainly based on IFPI, BPI and Cleveland Police's press releases and original BBC news footage of the arrest of Ellis. The British and Dutch Pirate Parties issued a joint statement condemning the actions as retaliatory, questioning the ethics of choreographing it and letting representatives of the alleged victims participate in the investigation. In the days following the arrest, when news sources like Wired, The Guardian, and Slyck.com started fact checking based on internet sources, it was revealed that not everything reported in the mainstream media was entirely correct. Common errors quoted by media were: that OiNK was an extremely lucrative website and made hundreds of thousands of pounds from \\"donations\\", which users had to pay to be able to download; that users had to offer new content to the site in order to get invitations; and that the site was centered around the release of pre-released material. The first two claims clearly conflicted with the site's written rules and conventions. A counterargument for the third was that only a tiny portion of the site's content was pre-released material. TechCrunch wrote that while links to pre- release albums definitely appeared on OiNK early it was unlikely that the site's members were actually responsible for these releases and claim this shows how poorly the scene is understood. After OiNK was raided, several new BitTorrent Trackers were set up by former members of the site. Legal proceedings Between 23 and 28 May 2008 six former members were arrested and questioned, but released on bail without being charged. On 12 September 2008 five of the six members of OiNK who had previously been arrested were charged with copyright infringement. The sixth, OiNK's administrator Alan Ellis, had bail extended four times until 10 September 2008, when he was finally charged with conspiracy to defraud. A hearing was held at a magistrates' court on 24 September 2008. On 24 September Ellis's case, along with the case of one of the former OiNK members charged with copyright infringement, were referred to the Crown Court sitting at Middlesbrough, with the next hearing scheduled for 2 October 2008 but the conspiracy to defraud case was adjourned until 14 November 2008 at Teesside Crown Court. It was then adjourned again until 12 December, then 23 March 2009, then 15 May 2009, and once again until 25 September 2009. In December 2008 four of the former OiNK members pleaded guilty at Teesside Crown Court, where they were charged with copyright infringement offences. Three were sentenced to a total of 330 hours of community service and court costs of £378 each; the other fined £500. A further defendant, also charged with a copyright infringement offence, pleaded not guilty and was set for trial along with the administrator of the site, Alan Ellis. On 15 January 2010 Ellis was found not guilty of conspiracy to defraud, with the jury returning a unanimous verdict. Ellis was represented by Morgan Rose, with Alex Stein as the barrister. The CPS took the decision to continue the prosecution against the final OiNK defendant, Matthew Wyatt, despite their failure to secure a conviction against Ellis. The matter was due to proceed to trial but, at the eleventh hour, the CPS decided to drop the case entirely. Commentary at the time suggested that this was in an effort to shield the International Federation of Phonographic Industries and the British Phonographic Industry from explaining the methods by which they secured the evidence against Wyatt, as well as the practices of the music industry in general. Wyatt was represented by David Cook of Burrows Bussin. Cook would later go on to successfully represent one of the defendants from the popular FileSoup forum, acquitted of similar allegations in March 2011. David Cook later moved to Manchester-based firm Pannone Solicitors, and defends clients in cyber crime prosecutions nationally. Notable users OiNK's user-base included several musicians, most notably Trent Reznor, founder of Nine Inch Nails. In a 2007 interview, Reznor said \\"I'll admit I had an account there and frequented it quite often. At the end of the day, what made Oink a great place was that it was like the world's greatest record store. Pretty much anything you could ever imagine, it was there, and it was there in the format you wanted. If Oink cost anything, I would certainly have paid, but there isn't the equivalent of that in the retail space right now.\\" Of the site's member's, Reznor opined, \\"They're not stealing it because they're going to make money off of it; they're stealing it because they love the band.\\" Reznor also criticised legal music download sites such as iTunes, due to \\"DRM, low bit rate, etc.\\" Reznor later worked for legal music services Beats and then Apple Music, saying of the latter \\"It’s kind of a miracle to think that a device in your pocket can play pretty much any song that the world has ever created.\\" See also * What.CD ReferencesExternal links *An interview with the site's founder from Telegraph *Squeals of Oink lovers reverberate across the Internet from Paste magazine *Stationary Hund - The Oink Song from YouTube *Pirated by iTunes, Artist Benn Jordan Turns to BitTorrent *Mudd up!

Poker table at the 2004 World Poker Tour at the Bellagio hotel and casino in Las Vegas. A poker table or card table is a table specifically designed for playing card games. Traditional card tables The card table arose around 1700 as card games became wildly popular in Europe. The manufacture of card tables as fine home furniture lasted to the middle of the 1800s. Card tables made in this era often had a folding top, which enabled them to serve as pier tables, console tables, or end tables when not in use. Styles ranged from simple to elaborate, with higher-end card tables featuring inlaid wood or stone, extensive delicate carvings, and expensive veneers. Some even had indentations carved into the playing surface to hold playing tokens, and slots around the rim which served as candle-holders. Semicircular (or \\"D\\" or \\"half-round\\") tables in diameter (when opened) were the most popular card table in both North America and Europe. Typical American card tables from the late colonial and early American periods feature simple, straight lines, an ovolo corner, and square-tapered legs. Furniture makers in New York often created card tables with a fifth leg (to support the opened top) hinged to the rear of the table, long reeded legs with swelled feet that end in cylinders, and veneered sides and crossbanded edges around the leaves and table. Modern poker tables The modern poker table is a form of card table which is often covered with baize (a type of felt) or speed cloth (a Teflon-coated fabric) to help the cards slide easily across the surface. It is either an actual table or a fold-out tabletop surface. Those used in professional televised poker feature \\"pocketcams\\" which can view a player's pocket, or hole cards. Such tables are usually fairly oval-shaped, with the players sitting around a curve of the table with a dealer facing them in an indented area of the table made specifically for the dealer. In amateur poker, tables are often oval, round or octagonal, using a rotating dealer position. The edge of the table is usually padded and raised slightly for the players to rest their arms, and this section is called the \\"rail\\". There is often a section of wood between the rail and the playing surface; this is called the \\"race track\\" and often features cup holders as well. The center of the table often features an image, usually the name or logo of the casino or house where the game is being played.

The condition is frequently fatal due to the profuse bleeding that results from the rupture. Since the aorta branches directly from the heart to supply blood to the rest of the body, the pressure within it is very great, and blood may be pumped out of a tear in the blood vessel very rapidly. This can quickly result in shock and death. Thus traumatic aortic rupture is a common killer in automotive accidents and other traumas, with up to 18% of deaths that occur in automobile collisions being related to the injury. In fact, aortic disruption due to blunt chest trauma is the second leading cause of injury death behind traumatic brain injury. Aortic rupture can also be caused by non-traumatic mechanisms, particularly abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture.  Symptoms  Symptoms are often unreliable, but include severe tearing chest pain; cough; dyspnea (shortness of breath); dysphagia (difficulty swallowing); back pain; and hoarseness. Blood pressure is usually high in the upper body, but low in the lower body. A widened mediastinum and a massive left hemothorax are often found in an X-ray. There can be bruising of the anterior chest wall, and a systolic murmur can be heard on the bottom of the heart. Causes The injury is usually caused by high speed impacts such as those that occur in vehicle collisions and serious falls. It may be due to different rates of deceleration of the heart and the aorta, which is in a fixed position. Location of rupture By far the most common site for tearing in traumatic aortic rupture is the proximal descending aorta, near where the left subclavian artery branches off from the aorta. The tethering of the aorta by the ligamentum arteriosum makes the site prone to shearing forces during sudden deceleration. A study of people who died after traumatic aortic rupture found that in 55–65% of cases the damage was at the aortic isthmus and in 10–14% it was in the ascending aorta or aortic arch. An angiogram will often show an irregular outpouching beyond the takeoff of the left subclavian artery at the aortic isthmus, representing an aortic pseudoaneurysm caused by the trauma. Damage can also be in the lower thoracic or abdominal aorta. Pathology The aorta is not always torn completely through; it may also tear some but not all layers of the arterial wall, sometimes forming a false aneurysm. A sub-intimal hemorrhage is the least serious type.  Intimal tear  Being the mildest form, it often does not weaken the wall of the aorta and may heal on its own. Usually, it occurs in the descending aorta. It was originally defined as a small intimal flap with less than one centimeter length and with little or no haematoma. It is 10-28% of aortic injuries. Diagnosis The condition is difficult to detect and may go unnoticed, because many patients have no specific symptoms. Diagnosis is further complicated by the fact that many patients with the injury experienced multiple other serious injuries as well, so the attention of hospital staff may be distracted from the possibility of aortic rupture. In fact most cases occur along with other injuries. A common symptom is unusually high blood pressure in the upper body and very low blood pressure in lower limbs. Another sign is kidney failure where the creatinine level shoots very high and urine output becomes negligible. In most cases, however, the doctors would misinterpret kidney failure as due to issues with the kidney itself and may recommend dialysis. Though not completely reliable, chest X-rays are the first-line investigation, initially used to diagnose this condition when the patient is unstable and cannot be sent to the CT bay. The preferred method of diagnosis used to be CT angiogram until it was found to cause complications in some people; now it is reserved for when CT scans are inconclusive. The classical findings on a chest X-ray will be widened mediastinum, apical cap, and displacement of the trachea, left main bronchus, or nasogastric tube. A normal chest x-ray does not exclude transection, but will diagnose conditions such as pneumothorax or hydrothorax. The aorta may also be torn at the point where it is connected to the heart. The aorta may be completely torn away from the heart, but patients with such injuries rarely survive very long after the injury; thus it is much more common for hospital staff to treat patients with partially torn aortas. When the aorta is partially torn, it may form a \\"pseudoaneurysm\\". In patients who do live long enough to be seen in a hospital, a majority have only a partially torn blood vessel, with the outermost adventitial layer still intact. In some of these patients, the adventitia and nearby structures within the chest may serve to prevent severe bleeding. After trauma, the aorta can be assessed by a CT angiogram or a direct angiogram, in which contrast is introduced into the aorta via a catheter. Treatment= Aortic transection  Traumatic aortic rupture is treated with surgery. However, morbidity and mortality rates for surgical repair of the aorta for this condition are among the highest of any cardiovascular surgery. For example, surgery is associated with a high rate of paraplegia, because the spinal cord is very sensitive to ischemia (lack of blood supply), and the nerve tissue can be damaged or killed by the interruption of the blood supply during surgery. A less invasive option for treatment is endovascular repair, which does not require open thoracotomy and can be safer for people with other injuries to organs. Since high blood pressure could exacerbate an incomplete tear in the aorta or even separate it completely from the heart, which would almost inevitably kill the patient, hospital staff take measures to keep the blood pressure low. Such measures include giving pain medication, keeping the patient calm, and avoiding procedures that could cause gagging or vomiting. Beta blockers and vasodilators can be given to lower the blood pressure, and intravenous fluids that might normally be given are foregone to avoid raising it. In 1959, Passaro reported the first successful surgical repair of a torn aorta. Kirsh, in 1976, reported a 70% success rate in surgery to repair a torn aorta, based on 10 years of experience as a surgeon. Therefore, for those sufferers who make it to the hospital (85% do not), are successfully diagnosed in time and are quickly operated upon, the chances of survival are higher.  Intimal tear  In some cases, intimal tears may resolve on their own. Therefore, conservative treatment like antihypertensives are usually initiated. There is limited data on the treatment of this type of aortic injury. In some places, endovascular repair is also an option for treatment. Prognosis Death occurs immediately after traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta 75%-90% of the time since bleeding is so severe, and 80-85% of patients die before arriving at a hospital. Of those who live to reach a hospital, 23% die at the time of or shortly after arrival. In the US, an estimated 7,500–8,000 cases occur yearly, of which 1,000–1,500 make it to a hospital alive; these low numbers make it difficult to estimate the efficacy of surgical options. However, if surgery is performed in time, it can offer a chance of survival. Though there is a concern that a small, stable tear in the aorta could enlarge and cause complete rupture of the aorta and heavy bleeding, this may be less common than previously believed as long as the blood pressure does not get too high. There have been five rare cases of a traumatic aortic rupture going undiagnosed of more than a year, and presenting with chest and back pain. They had pseudoaneurysms or large aneurysms that caused pain. Asymptomatic chronic traumatic aneurysms are not always a risk for sudden death unless too large. Growing aneurysms, symptomatic or not, have a risk of rupture so the treatment is surgical removal.

Tyler was an early parliamentary candidate for the Ecology Party, in the 1976 Walsall North by- election, at a time when he was a transport lecturer at the University of Birmingham. He was the Ecology Party's Chairman for some years from 1976. Tyler would later go on to stand as a candidate in local elections. During the 1980s he was associated with attempts by the 'Maingreen' group to streamline the Green Party's internal workings. He subsequently left the Green Party, but rejoined some years later. Tyler joined British Rail as a Traffic Apprentice in 1962. He became a British Rail-sponsored university lecturer and since 2000 has run a consultancy called Passenger Transport Networks. He has specialised in making the case for the importance of integrated strategic timetabling, drawing in particular on the Swiss Taktfahrplan methodology. The Taktfahrplan is based on repeating hourly cycles where trains meet at hubs around symmetry minutes (normally xx.00 and xx.30) to optimise connections in all directions. To create an optimal 'Taktfahrplan' system, infrastructure must be designed with the network timetable in mind. The 'Taktfahrplan' aims to create notions of convenience and accessibility to encourage people to use public transport. Tyler has argued for a National Timetabling Authority to plan an integrated strategic timetable. Tyler has critiqued High Speed 2 from a \\"green\\" perspective, and has written about the implications a \\"green\\" agenda should have for railway timetabling. He chaired the York Environment Forum until 2010. He is now a member of York Green Party and was the party's Parliamentary Candidate for York Central in 2015, winning 10% of the vote.

WDCZ has not originated any programming of its own since 2012. The station operated as a commercial station from its launch in 1924 until 1975, then operated as a public radio station from 1975 to 2012. In its later years, much of its programming was duplicating that of competing FM station WBFO, which eventually prompted the two stations to merge operations (using WBFO's frequency) in 2012. After several months of simulcasting WBFO, the 970 facility was sold off to the owners of religious-formatted WDCX-FM, who in turn switched 970 to a simulcast of WDCX, a status it has held ever since. History WDCZ was launched on October 14, 1924 as WEBR. Fran Striker, later famous for co-creating the Lone Ranger, worked for the station in the early 1930s. From 1936 to 1944, WEBR was an affiliate of the Blue Network (later the American Broadcasting Company) and then with the Mutual Broadcasting System.http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com/broadcasters/hist_webr.asp The station was a commercial operation for its first five decades on air, competing (generally with a measure of success, despite the weakness of its highly directional signal that is aimed directly at Toronto) against competing Buffalo stations. At at least two points in its history it was a sister station to WBEN, during the times when regulatory rules allowed it. The station changed formats and owners (one of which was the Buffalo Courier- Express) in the early 1970s until the Western New York Public Broadcasting Association, who had owned WNED-TV since 1959, bought WEBR and sister station WREZ-FM (now WNED-FM) in 1975. WEBR adopted an (almost) all-news format a year later (although an evening and overnight jazz program, Jazz In The Nighttime with Al Wallack, remained on the air). In 1993 the station was assigned the WNED calls and all non-news programming was dropped.Buffalo Broadcasters website History of WEBR/WNED 1924 to 1998 Buffalo Broadcasters Association Retrieved 29 December 2012 (The WEBR call sign, history and Wallack's jazz program would later be acquired by local taxicab company owner Bill Yuhnke and assigned to the former WJJL on AM 1440 in 2020; in addition to Wallack, former WEBR midday jock Jack Horohoe was brought out of retirement to resume his show.https://www.wkbw.com/news/local-news/hes-back-on-the-radio- after-a-49-year-hiatushttp://www.buffalobroadcasters.com/webr-am-returns-to- airwaves/) Unlike its counterpart WBFO, which still had music programming in midday, at night and on the weekend, WNED focused entirely on spoken-word programming. Several of the programs on WNED and WBFO (specifically both drive time programs, Morning Edition and All Things Considered) overlapped with different production teams for local inserts, each with its own hosts. (In addition, the weekend A Prairie Home Companion aired on both WNED-AM and WNED- FM, an arrangement that continues as of 2013 with WBFO and WNED-FM.) Until March 1, 2012, WNED was one of two National Public Radio affiliates in Buffalo. The remaining affiliate is WBFO, formerly operated by the University of Buffalo. WBFO was purchased from the State of New York by the Western New York Public Broadcasting Association, the parent organization of WNED, WNED-TV and WNED-FM in July 2011. With WNED's takeover of WBFO, the duplication of programming was expected to end;http://www.buffalonews.com/entertainment/article674904.ece there had been speculation (which turned out to be accurate) that WNED would be sold despite strong support in the local market for differentiated jazz, blues, news and talk programming.http://blogs.artvoice.com/avdaily/2011/10/05/wbfo-wned-get- earful-from-public/ On March 1, 2012, WNED ceased independent operations and began simulcasting WBFO. This led to much of the news and information programming that had aired on the weekend by WNED being replaced by NPR entertainment programs, such as Wait Wait Don't Tell Me and Car Talk (some of the displaced programs later returned after Talk of the Nation was canceled). WNED, which had not aired music since 1993, now aired blues programming Saturday and Sunday evenings, but in return, WBFO (and, with it, the entire Buffalo market) was stripped of all of its jazz programming.http://www.publicbroadcasting.net/wbfo/guide.guidemain?action=viewGuide On August 29, 2012, Crawford Broadcasting, a Denver based firm, announced its intention to buy the then-WNED for $875,000. A spokeswoman for WNED said a closing date for the sale depended on approval by regulators. Donald B. Crawford, the Crawford Broadcasting president said that he expected his company to take over the station and begin programming it around January 1, 2013. The WBFO simulcast continued until midnight November 30, 2012. The owner at that time had announced at 10 pm that it would cease operations at midnight. The station was silent for an entire month which gave those who enjoy trying to receive distant stations an opportunity to receive distant signals at or near that frequency that they would not otherwise have.Chernos Saul Mon, 03 Dec 2012 19:01:56 -0800 Reporting the open frequency as a benefit for those wishing to receive long distance reception. 970 WNED NY Buffalo off- air International Radio Club of America Retrieved 10 December 2012. The station returned to the air as WDCZ on January 1, 2013 as a simulcast of WDCX- FM (99.5). This is a second station for Crawford in the Buffalo market as it is the long time owner of WDCX, whose programming it planned to simulcast in order to further its reach into southern Ontario (this despite WDCX already having one of the strongest signals in the entire country and one that easily covers Southern Ontario), further perpetuating the same type of duplicity that had prompted the previous owners to sell the station in the first place. The finalization of the sale took place at midnight November 30, 2012, through licensee Kimtron, Inc; the station's call sign was changed the same day to WDCZ.

History WNED-FM first signed on as a commercial radio station on June 6, 1960, with the call letters WEBR-FM.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-139 It was a sister station to WEBR (which at the time was at AM 970, a frequency now occupied by repeater WDCZ). On September 24, 1971, WEBR-FM was renamed WBCE; on May 21, 1973, it became WREZ, before returning to the WEBR-FM call sign on April 21, 1975. In 1975, the Western New York Educational TV Association bought it and AM 970 WEBR, turning both stations into non-commercial operations. On August 14, 1976, 94.5 was renamed WNED-FM, and the following year began offering a classical music format.

This adhesion occurs as part of the transitory initial encounters between T cells and Antigen Presenting Cells before T cell activation, when T cells are roaming the lymph nodes looking at the surface of APCs for peptide:MHC complexes the T-cell receptors are reactive to. Polymorphisms in the CD58 gene are associated with increased risk for multiple sclerosis. Genomic region containing the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1335532, associated with high risk of multiple sclerosis, has enhancer properties and can significantly boost the CD58 promoter activity in lymphoblast cells. The protective (C) rs1335532 allele creates functional binding site for ASCL2 transcription factor, a target of the Wnt signaling pathway CD58 plays a role in the regulation of colorectal tumor-initiating cells (CT-ICs). Thus, cells that express CD58 have become a cell of interest in tumorigenesis. Mutations of CD58 have been linked to immune evasion observed in some lymphomas and studies are underway to analyze how its involvement directly affects classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).

Description The school, across its three buildings, a new one being built currently, has a roll of over 432 boys, approximately 60 in each year from Years 1-8 and 40 in Reception. Reception to Year 3 (ages 4–7) are based in the Junior School, Years 4 and 5 (ages 8–10) in the Middle School and Years 6 to 8 (ages 11–13) in the Senior School. The school operates a house system of four houses: Blue, Green, Orange and Purple. These are used throughout the school for academic, physical and musical competitions. The school is known for its pink and grey uniform consisting for many years of a pink school blazer, cap and tie. This would prove somewhat of a target for the other students in the area, as Giles Coren, an old boy, recalled in The Times. History The school originated as Belsize School, founded in 1889 by the Reverend Francis John Wrottesley, who with his wife had taken fee-paying pupils at their home in nearby 18 Buckland Crescent since 1881. The Wrottesleys sold their school in 1898 to the Revd D. H. Marshall, who took over an adjoining house in 1903, when there were 58 boys, including 10 boarders. In 1905 Marshall bought Rebecca and Sarah Allen Olney's girls' school, which his wife continued at Buckland Crescent. Marshall moved the boys to Crossfield Road and renamed the school The Hall. The roll was over 100 in 1909, when he sold the school to G. H. Montauban. It prepared boys aged 5 to 13 for public schools and won many scholarships. Montauban bought Woodcote at 69 Belsize Park, at the corner of Buckland Crescent, in 1916 and opened it in 1917 for boys under 8. The school was recognized from 1919, when Montauban sold The Hall to R. T. Gladstone, retaining the junior school until 1923. In the 1920s the roll increased from 60 to 270. In 1935 ownership passed to a private company. The main building was extended in 1935 and the junior school in 1938. The roll fell to 45 in 1940, but under a new company rose to 170 in 1942. The junior school, evacuated in 1939, reopened in 1942 with 35 boys. The school became a charitable trust in 1952. In 1951 there were 302 boys aged 5 to 15, including 30 boarders, but boarding ceased between 1967 and 1974. In 1983 the school prepared up to 320 boys for public schools.Hampstead: Education, A History of the County of Middlesex: Vol 9: Hampstead, Paddington (1989), pp159-169.

She was laid down on 9 June 1911 and was commissioned on 28 June 1913. She cost £106,700. E5 was sunk, probably by striking a mine, on 7 March 1916. Design The early British E-class submarines, from E1 to E8, had a displacement of at the surface and while submerged. They had a length overall of and a beam of , and were powered by two Vickers eight-cylinder two-stroke diesel engines and two electric motors.Akerman, P. (1989). Encyclopaedia of British submarines 1901-1955\\\\. p.150. Maritime Books. The class had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of , with a fuel capacity of of diesel affording a range of when travelling at , while submerged they had a range of at . The early 'Group 1' E class boats were armed with four 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, one in the bow, one either side amidships, and one in the stern; a total of eight torpedoes were carried. Group 1 boats were not fitted with a deck gun during construction, but those involved in the Dardanelles campaign had guns mounted forward of the conning tower while at Malta Dockyard. E-Class submarines had wireless systems with power ratings; in some submarines, these were later upgraded to systems by removing a midship torpedo tube. Their maximum design depth was although in service some reached depths of below . Service history E5 had a very short career before and after her commissioning. She experienced an engine room explosion on 8 June 1913, twenty days before commissioning, which resulted in thirteen deaths. A further three men were killed when there was an oil blow back into the starboard engine off St Ann's Head. The submarine depot ship and Alligator carried the medical team out to meet E5 on her way into Pembroke Dock. Ten other men were seriously injured, although all civilian staff from Barrow were safe and unharmed. In December 1913, E5 was part of the Eighth Submarine Flotilla, based at Portsmouth and remained a part of the Eighth Flotilla at the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. The Eighth Flotilla, including E5 was assigned to patrol in the east end of the English Channel during the passage of the British Expeditionary Force to France in early August. On 15–17 August 1914, the British Grand Fleet carried out a sweep in the North Sea towards Helgoland. E5 and sister submarine were ordered to patrol off the mouth of the Weser river in support of this operation, while and patrolled off the Ems. On 16 August E5 encountered several German torpedo boats, which attacked E5, while the British submarine unsuccessfully attempted to torpedo one of the German ships. The next day a German submarine attempted to torpedo E5 which E5 managed to avoid before setting off for home. Early on the morning of 18 August, while still on their return journey, E5 and E7 spotted a four-funnelled cruiser. Believing that the unidentified ship was British, E5 challenged the cruiser, which provoked a violent response from what was actually the German cruiser , which, with the cruiser , was carrying out a sweep into the Hoofden in search for British blockading forces. Strassburg fired at the British submarines, which dived to safety. In April 1915, E5 was deployed (along with , and ) to the German Bight to counter a suspected sortie by the German High Seas Fleet. On 14 April E5 torpedoed the German steamer Schwarzwald north of the Norderney lighthouse. German trawlers and aircraft drove off E5, allowing the damaged Schwarzwald to safely make port. E5s commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander C. S. Benning, was commended by the Admiralty for damaging Schwarzwald. On 3 May 1915 E5 was one of five British submarines lying off the German coast, when they were spotted by the German airship L9. The German airship dropped bombs on the British submarines, while E5 fired on L9 with her deck gun. E5 claimed to have hit L9 but the German airship was undamaged. L9 claimed to have sunk one of the British submarines, but while was near-missed by L9s bombs, she too was undamaged. On 25 September 1915 E5 torpedoed the German Sperrbrecher (auxiliary minesweeper) SP11, causing SP11 to be beached. Salvage attempts on the German ship were abandoned on 27 September. E5s crew was awarded prize money by the British Admiralty for the sinking of SP11. Loss E5 was lost on 7 March 1916 while rescuing the survivors of the trawler Resono, just north of Juist in the North Sea. There were different theories about the reason for the loss of E5. One theory was that she struck a mine, possibly after straying into a German minefield upon being sighted by the German light cruiser . Another theory attributed her loss to depth charge attack by torpedo boats escorting the battlecruiser . In 2016 divers found the wreck of E5 off the island of Schiermonnikoog. Her hatches were open, which suggests that the crew had tried to escape. There was no sign of damage to her hull, indicating that she had not sunk as a result of enemy action.

M. Stirling. It is the first installment of the Emberverse series and is a spin-off from S. M. Stirling's Nantucket series. In it, the Massachusetts island of Nantucket is thrown back in time from March 17, 1998 to the Bronze Age. In Dies the Fire, S. M. Stirling chronicles two groups during \\"The Change\\", a mysterious worldwide event suddenly alters physical laws so electricity, gunpowder, and most other forms of high-energy-density technology no longer work. As a result of this, modern civilization comes crashing down. Setting Dies the Fire is a fantasy set in post-apocalyptic Oregon. After an unknown phenomenon disables most forms of modern technology such as electricity, high-pressure steam-power, combustion, computers, electronics, guns, car and jet engines, and batteries, people quickly adapt, relying on swords and bows. Many people starve, while others continue robbing, raping, and pillaging as before the transition. Many resort to cannibalism. During this collapse, rural folks form isolated farming communities, while urbanites are enslaved by warlords. The book follows the Bearkiller Outfit and the Clan Mackenzie as they struggle to survive... while attempting to understand the mystery of 'what made the lights go out?' in this post-apocalyptic world. Plot summary=The Bearkillers Mike Havel is a former United States Marine, veteran of the 1991 Persian Gulf invasion, and bush pilot. On March 17, 1998 at 6:15 pm PST, Havel is flying over the Bitterroot Mountain Range in Idaho during a mysterious event known as \\"The Change\\". His passengers are business owners Kenneth and Mary Larsson and their three teenage children, Erik, Signe, and Astrid. After the plane's engine and electronics are disabled, Mike makes an emergency landing. Everyone survives, although Mary is injured. The party hikes across mountains to a ranger cabin. Mike and Erik hike out onto the highway in hopes of finding help. When they get to the highway they encounter white supremacistsurvivalists who have taken prisoner Will Hutton (who is black) and his family. After a tense conversation with the survivalists Mike and Erik attack them. During the fight manages to draw off the survivalists, unfortunately leading them up the trail to the cabin where the rest of the Larsson family is waiting. Mike and Erik pursue them catching up to them after they have recaptured Will and taken control the cabin. Mike and Erik attack the survivalists in order to free Will and the Larsson family. Just prior to the fight the survivalists murdered Mary Larson and were about to rape Astrid and Signe. All three survivalists are killed. The Huttons, equine breeders and trainers, join Mike's band. The group elects Mike as their leader, then the group decides to travel from Idaho to 'Larsdalen', the Larsson estate in the Willamette Valley region of Oregon. Along the way, Astrid injures a black bear with an arrow from her bow, provoking it into attacking Mike. It injures Mike, then they kill it. The event gives the group their name: the Bearkillers. On the journey, the Bearkillers recruit other survivors. The Bearkillers are hired as mercenaries by a group near a Nez Perce Indian Reservation to deal with a cannibal band snatching people along the road to Lewiston. The bear killers eliminate the cannibals and rescue their remaining prisoners. Signe Signe is attracted to Mike, although she keeps him at arm's length, haunted by memories of her near rape at the hands of the survivalists. After their mercenary army is larger, Mike takes two companions to scout west. In Portland, Mike meets Norman Arminger, leader of the Portland Protective Association. Arminger, a university professor of medieval history and member of the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA), is re-instating feudalism by recruiting gang members and former SCA members, then eliminating anybody he does not need. Arminger offers the Bearkillers positions as Protectorate nobles, but Mike declines. After leaving Portland Mike and his companions rescue Juniper Mackenzie and her friends from a band of cannibals. Mike and Juniper have an instant mutual attraction, and have unprotected sex that night before the two groups separate from which Juniper becomes pregnant. After Mike and his companions returned to their group the Bearkillers are hired by Sheriff Woburn to fight \\"Duke Iron Rod\\" who is later revealed to be in league with Arminger to break the people of the Camas Prairie region and bring them under protectorate rule. The Bearkillers ambush one of Iron Rod's raiding parties. While they are away, a traitor helps a second group enter and attack the Bearkillers' camp. In the fighting, Ken Larsson loses his left hand and eye, but Mike and his men return in time to rout the attackers and capture Iron Rod. After reaching Larsdalen the Bearkillers along with the Clan Mackenzie and some ranchers raid a Protectorate castle Arminger has constructed to control an important route (Highway 20) over the Cascades. After the battle, Mike and Signe become engaged. Clan Mackenzie The parallel story of the formation of Clan Mackenzie begins with Juniper Mackenzie, a folk-singer and Wiccan priestess. Juniper is performing in a restaurant in Corvallis during The Change. She, along with her deaf teenage daughter Eilir, and their friend Dennis Martin, assist survivors of an airliner crash in the city. After looters realize guns no longer work, they attack a former government agent. Dennis and Juniper go to help and Juniper kills one. The others flee, and one of them, Eddie Liu, vows to avenge his dead friend. Liu becomes one of Arminger's barons. Juniper, Dennis, and Eilir gather supplies, collect Juniper's horses and wagon from a friend's farm, then head for Juniper's cabin in central Oregon. On the way, refugees attack them, and Eilir shoots a woman with her bow. The woman's companions flee, but the wounded woman and her son join the group. Some of Juniper's coven members go to Juniper's cabin after rescuing children on a bus. Juniper's Clan farm the land. While hunting, Juniper and Dennis rescue Sam Aylward, a former British army special forces soldier, superb archer and bowyer after he was entangled in an accidental fall. Juniper leads scouts around the area. They arrive in Corvallis, Oregon, and discover that Oregon State University professors have taken over the town. They escape the trap but are then ambushed by cannibals. Mike and his Bearkillers save them. Juniper and Mike have unprotected sex; Juniper gets pregnant. The Clan has a successful harvest, but nearby Sutterdown is occupied by Protectorate troopers. Juniper leads the Clan against the troopers, and drives them out of the town. Sam Aylward leads a group of Mackenzie archers to aid the Bearkillers' raid against a Protectorate castle, then force the surrender of a second castle. Juniper gives birth to a son named Rudi in memory of her late handfasted man. During Rudi's wiccaning, Juniper is overcome by inspiration, causing her to give Rudi the craft name of Artos, proclaiming a prophecy declaring him \\"the Sword of the Lady.\\" Characters in Dies the FireLiterary significance and reception Author Paul Di Filippo praised the novel saying: \\"Post-apocalypse novels often veer either too heavily into romantic Robinsonades or nihilistic dead ends. But Stirling [has] struck the perfect balance between grit and glory.\\" Filippo also complimented Stirling on his characterization, and ability to \\"make all his retro-tech plausible, easily visualizable and interesting.\\" The review on Scifidimensions called the novel \\"highly entertaining\\" and complimented Stirling on being able to make coming up with \\"novel premises, memorable characters, and hard to put down storytelling.\\" Mel Odom gave a positive review of the novel, and said the fact Mike and Juniper were imperfect heroes made them likable. He was pleased with the way Stirling worked in various themes from myths and legends into the story. Kel Munger from the Sacramento News and Review called the novel the \\"Best. Apocalyptic. Novel. Ever.\\" Some reviewers commented on the large amount of research. Thomas M. Wagner of SF Reviews.Net said Dies the Fire is \\"intelligent, meticulously crafted, but overlong and sometimes pokey end-of- the-world epic.\\" He complimented Stirling on his research, and said he was the one \\"the government needed to send to New Orleans to singlehandedly feed and rescue hurricane survivors.\\" Although thought the details drag, but it is a good read for those fans of \\"character-driven SF and fantasy epics.\\" Wagner although thought the novel would be stronger if Arminger a larger role. Raymond Camden, although he recommended the novel, thought details detracted from the story. SF Reviews called it a brilliantly-done post-disaster novel, but is more fantasy than science fiction. The review on SF Crowsnest called the opening of the book exciting as the reader follows Clan Mackenzie and the Bearkillers after the Change, although the book dragged at the end. There were negative reviews on the book. Danny Sullivan called the novel \\"grating\\" and \\"too forced to be that enjoyable.\\" He also thought it implausible for the main characters to be so lucky in a disaster on the scale of The Change. Dan Rahmel described the characters as unrealistic, and says the novel has too many improbabilities. References to other works * Characters and symbols from The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R.

Upper tangent arc and sunvex Parry arc seen over Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, on November 24, 2015. A Parry arc is a rare halo, an optical phenomenon which occasionally appears over a 22° halo together with an upper tangent arc.  Discovery  The halo was first described by Sir William Edward Parry (1790–1855) in 1820 during one of his Arctic expeditions in search for the Northwest Passage. On April 8, under harsh conditions while his two ships were trapped by ice forcing him to winter over at Melville Island in the northern Canadian Arctic Archipelago, he made a drawing of the phenomenon. The drawing accurately renders the parhelic circle, a 22° halo, a pair of sun dogs, a lower tangent arc, a 46° halo, and a circumzenithal arc. He did, however, get the upper tangent arc slightly wrong. On the other hand, he added two arcs extending laterally from the bases of the 46° halo, for long interpreted as incorrectly drawn infralateral arcs, but were probably correctly drawn subhelic arcs (both produced by the same crystal orientation but with light passing through different faces of the crystals).Cowley, Parry 1820  Formation  Parry arcs are generated by double-oriented hexagonal column crystals, i.e. a so-called Parry orientation, where both the central main axis of the prism and the top and bottom prism side faces are oriented horizontally. This orientation is responsible for several rare haloes. Parry arcs are the result of light passing through two side faces forming a 60° angle. The shape of Parry arcs changes with the elevation of the sun and are subsequently called upper or lower arcs to indicate they are found above or under the sun, and sunvex or suncave depending on their orientation.Cowley, Parry ArcsArbeitskreis Meteore, Parry Arc The mechanism by which column crystals adopt this special Parry orientation has been subject to much speculation – recent laboratory experiments have shown that it is the presence of crystals with a scalene hexagonal cross-section which are likely to be the cause. Parry arcs can be confused with either upper tangent arcs, Lowitz arcs, and any of the odd radius halos produced by pyramidal crystals.

The house is owned by a Christian charity, Harvest Vision, and the Moggerhanger House Preservation Trust, and has recently undergone a £7m refurbishment project with help from organisations such as the Heritage Lottery Fund, English Heritage, World Monuments Fund and the East of England Development Agency.  History  The original house at Moggerhanger was small and of Georgian design. The house was acquired by Godfrey Thornton, a Bank of England director, who commissioned the Bank's architect, John Soane, to remodel it between 1790 and 1793. More substantial work would follow when Thornton's son Stephen inherited the house. Soane continued from 1806 until the scheme was completed in 1812 while the Bank of England reconstruction was under way. Soane remodelled Moggerhanger entirely, enlarging it to the west, relocating the entrance to the north and reproofing the house completely. He incorporated his previous work from 1793 maintaining symmetries and Classical axes. Soane experimented with decoration, using it as a prototype for future work. As Ptolemy Dean notes, \\"with so much of the old fabric concealed by later finishes, it was little wonder that the importance of this building had been so under-recognised. The sense that this house and estate would soon emerge as one of Soane's key masterpieces was unimaginable.\\"Dean, Ptolemy. \\"It was Unimaginable that this House Would Emerge as a Soane Masterpiece.\\" The Architect's Journal 3 May 2007. pp 24–35 The house was rendered by Soane using \\"Parker's Roman Cement\\" of biscuit-brown color. This was a new material, patented hydraulic lime render, of his time. The garden side of seven bays has a wooden veranda. In the centre is a shallow pediment on pilaster strips with sunk panels. The entrance has a low centre with a semicircular porch of Greek Doric columns of the Delos type. The end bays have on the ground floor arched windows with broad Grecian pediment over. Behind the porch is a square entrance hall once with a shallow dome. The window bars are painted dark grey, which causes the window detail to disappear so that pure shapes of openings are clearly visible appearing like punch recesses. Inside there is an all- cantilevered staircase with simple iron balustrade. The gardens were designed by noted landscaper Humphry Repton. Only three other houses of Soane's are still standing: Pitzhanger Manor in Ealing, Tyringham Hall in Buckinghamshire, and Pell Wall Hall in Shropshire, plus the library at Stowe House in Buckinghamshire. The house was used as a hospital for most of the 20th century. In 1919 it was opened as a TB isolation hospital, and then became an orthopedic hospital in the late 1950s. In 1960 it was renamed Park Hospital, but closed in 1987 when a new wing was built in Bedford Hospital. From that point the house went into a state of disrepair. Restoration The house was for sale for £1 in 1994 when it was noticed by neighbour Isabelle Hay, Countess of Erroll, who lives at nearby Woodbury Hall. Though the house was crumbling, it retained its original features. Its listing was upgraded from Grade II* to Grade I. \\"All the original woodwork, the doors, bits of decorative ceilings, mantels, flags and fireplace surrounds, remnants of wallpapers, were all still there,\\" the countess said. \\"It is such a fine example—there isn't another like it.\\" Lady Erroll formed the Moggerhanger House Preservation Trust along with the Lord Lieutenant of Bedfordshire Sam Whitbread, and architect Peter Inskip. The Heritage Lottery Fund donated £3.5 million toward the project, and by 2005 the expenditure had approached £7 million. \\"We keep finding new wonderful things which cost money to restore,\\" Lady Erroll said in 2005. \\"We have had to make sacrifices, which is why the car park hasn't been done yet, the Repton grounds haven't been restored and we have no furniture.\\" Soane's lengthy relationship with the house provided a backdrop for him to experiment, said Inskip, the architect who oversaw the restoration. \\"In the records you could see a friendship develop between architect and client over 40 years,\\" Inskip said. \\"This allowed Soane to experiment, so there are things here that tell us about aspects of some of the buildings that were lost. Through the depth of research and unpicking we have revealed a great work of art which has been ignored for 100 years. Soane is up there with the great British architects - Inigo Jones, Wren, Hawksmoor.\\" The restoration project took 10 years to complete, and members of the local village and local churches volunteered help and support to complete the work and maintain the site whilst building contractors were working.  The present  The house is now used as a conference and training centre for most of the year, but opens as a tourist attraction from mid-June to mid-September, during which time public tours are conducted twice daily. Free access to the grounds is available throughout the year. There is a spacious tea room and children's play area within the grounds.The Woodland Cafe. Moggerhanger Park The house has become a centre of local community activities and its successful restoration has been a triumph for the local village and for Bedfordshire. The Moggerhanger House Preservation Trust, a registered charity, is currently trying to secure funds to restore Humphrey Repton’s parkland surrounding the house.

The treaty was signed by five Siamese plenipotentiaries (among them Wongsa Dhiraj Snid, one of the king's half-brothers) and by Sir John Bowring, Governor of Hong Kong, Britain's envoy. The Burney Treaty had been signed between Siam and Britain in 1826. The new treaty elaborated and liberalized trade rules and regulations by creating a new system of imports and exports. The treaty allowed free trade by foreigners in Bangkok, as foreign trade had previously been subject to heavy royal taxation. The treaty also allowed the establishment of a British consulate in Bangkok and guaranteed its full extraterritorial powers, and allowed Englishmen to own land in Siam. The regulations in short are: # British subjects were placed under consular jurisdiction. Thus, for the first time, Siam granted extraterritoriality to foreign aliens. # British subjects were given the right to trade freely in all seaports, and to reside permanently in Bangkok. They were to be allowed to buy and rent property in the environs of Bangkok; namely, in the area more than four miles from city walls but less than twenty four hours' journey from the city (calculated at the speed of native boats). British subjects were also to be allowed to travel freely in the interior with passes provided by the consul. # Measurement duties were abolished and import and export duties fixed. ## The import duty was fixed at three percent for all articles, with two exceptions: opium was to be free of duty, but it had to be sold to the opium farmer, and bullion was to be free of duty. ## Articles of export were to be taxed just once, whether the tax was called an inland tax, a transit duty, or an export duty. # British merchants were to be allowed to buy and sell directly with individual Siamese without interference from any third person. # The Siamese government reserved the right to prohibit the export of salt, rice, and fish whenever these articles were deemed to be scarce. Officially a Treaty of Friendship and Commerce, it is nonetheless claimed to be an unequal treaty as Siam was not in a position to negotiate, considering that Britain had demonstrated its military might during the First Opium War with China, thereby discouraging any attempts to prevent Western trade. Siam's fears were only consolidated by the fact that negotiations that had occurred five years earlier between Sir James Brooke, the White Rajah of Sarawak and British envoy, and Siam's King Nangklao had failed, and had led to Brooke threatening to employ gunboat diplomacy to force Siam's hand. The treaty eventually led other foreign powers to sign their own bilateral treaties, based on the rules set by the Bowring Treaty. American envoy Townsend Harris, while on his way to Japan, was delayed in Bangkok for a month by finalization of the Burney Treaty, but had only to negotiate a few minor points to convert it into the 1856 American Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Siam. The Bowring treaty in particular ensured that foreign powers would not intervene in Siam's internal affairs, and allowed for Siam to remain independent. The Bowring Treaty is now credited with having led to the economic development of Bangkok, as it created a framework in which multilateral trade could operate freely in Southeast Asia, notably between China, Singapore, and Siam.

It is based on a 1940 Broadway play of the same title by Reginald Denham and Edward Percy which starred Flora Robson in the lead role.. Plot Ellen Creed, a proud spinster fallen on hard times, has been housekeeper/companion to her old friend Miss Leonora Fiske, a wealthy retiree who in her youth had been a chorus girl \\"of easy virtue\\", for about two years. Lucy is a maid who has also been there for some time. Ellen gets a letter one day about her two sisters, both of whom are a bit peculiar. The letter says that unless she can get them under control, the police will be called and they will be evicted from their flat for outlandish behavior. Ellen asks Miss Fiske if her sisters can visit and she says yes. One day when Ellen's away, a handsome young stranger called Albert Feather turns up, claiming to be Ellen's nephew. He is in need of money so Miss Fiske goes to her hiding place and lends him some. He makes her promise not to tell Ellen that he borrowed money or that he was even there. She agrees. Ellen returns with her sisters, who wear out their welcome quickly. They are a burden to Miss Fiske and Lucy. Miss Fiske eventually complains to Ellen, pointing out that two days have turned into six weeks. They are wrecking her things and her nerves. Finally, Miss Fiske orders them out, ignoring the pleas of Ellen, who dreads their being sent to an institution. Ellen snaps. She strangles Miss Fiske to death. Ellen tells visitors and Lucy that Miss Fiske is traveling. She tells her sisters she bought the house and makes them swear on a bible that they will never talk about Miss Fiske or that she sold the house to anyone. Both sisters swear. The neighbor nuns come in a terrible storm to borrow something. Ellen sends Lucy to the shed to get it. She is surprised there by Albert. She had a flirtation with Albert the first time he was at the Fiske home. He flirts with her again and asks her to promise not to tell Ellen he has been there before, asks her not to say anything about him being there in the shed. He says he wants to come to the front door and enter there. Lucy giddily agrees. Albert tells Ellen he needs help and a place to stay because he is a thief wanted by the law. Ellen wants none of it. To avoid undue attention to the living situation at the Fiske home, she buys him a boat ticket out of the country and says she will give him some money to get started in the new country. Albert and Lucy find evidence that Ellen is hiding something about Miss Fiske. They find Miss Fiske's wig, wondering why she didn't travel with it. Albert intercepts a letter from the bank, asking why Miss Fiske’s signature on a check is so much different than the one they have on file. He reads the blotter after Ellen writes back to them about a “sprained wrist”. Lucy isn’t quite smart enough to figure out what is going on. But Albert is definitely figuring it out. Albert seduces Lucy. He tries to steal the hidden money, but fails to find it. He deduces what Ellen must have done. He gets Lucy to sit at the piano, playing Miss Fiske's favorite song, wearing a wig with her back to Ellen, who screams at the sight of her and faints. The wagon arrives in the morning to take Albert to the boat. But he has decided to stay and try to blackmail his aunt so he can have an easy life in the country. He confronts Ellen and she confesses. He talks about his own crimes. Lucy overhears them and flees the house. The neighbor nuns come to the door and Albert hides. The nuns tell Ellen the police are looking for a man who fits Albert's description and leave. Albert comes out of hiding and tells Ellen she had better make a run for it too. She demures. Albert takes the ticket and money from her and leaves. Ellen's sisters return from their walk and tell Ellen they saw Albert playing tag with 2 men and they caught him. Ellen smiles and dons her coat and hat. Her sisters ask if she will be back soon and she smiles and says she doesn't know. She is seen walking out on the road, into the fog.

The Knights' castle at Rhodes The history of Rhodes under the Order of Saint John lasted from 1310 until 1522. The island of Rhodes was a sovereign territorial entity of the Knights Hospitaller who settled on the island from Palestine and from Cyprus, where they did not exercise temporal power. The first Grand Master was the French Foulques de Villaret (1305-1319). After the fall of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1291 (the city of Jerusalem had fallen in 1187), the Knights were confined to the County of Tripoli and, when Acre was captured in 1291, the order sought refuge in the Kingdom of Cyprus. Finding themselves becoming enmeshed in Cypriot politics, their Master, Guillaume de Villaret, created a plan of acquiring their own temporal domain, selecting Rhodes to be their new home, part of the Byzantine empire. Due to repeated disagreements with the king of Cyprus Henry II, which left the privileges of the Knights Hospitaller unaltered, Foulques de Villaret made the decision to transfer the Order to the nearby island of Rhodes which was under the formal authority of the Byzantine emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos. He then went to Avignon and Paris to ask for help and consent from Pope Clement V and King Philip IV of France. The pontiff approved the project and, without revealing the end of the mission, ordered the sending of new crusaders and in September 1308 a fleet of Genoese and Neapolitan ships set sail from Brindisi. The emperor had rejected the homage proposal made by Villaret and sent reinforcements to defend the island. The Knights repulsed them. On 15 August 1310, after over four years of campaigning, the city of Rhodes surrendered to the knights. They also gained control of a number of neighbouring islands and the Anatolian port of Halicarnassus and the island of Kastellorizo. At Rhodes, the resident knights of each langue were headed by a baili. The English Grand Prior at the time was Philip De Thame, who acquired the estates allocated to the English langue from 1330 to 1358. In 1334, the Knights of Rhodes defeated Andronicus and his Turkish auxiliaries. In the 14th century, there were several other battles in which they fought. In 1374, the Knights took over the defence of Smyrna, conquered by a crusade in 1344. They held it until it was besieged and taken by Timur in 1402. On Rhodes the Hospitallers were forced to become a more militarised force, fighting especially with the Barbary pirates. They withstood two invasions in the 15th century, one by the Sultan of Egypt in 1444 and another by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror in 1480 who, after capturing Constantinople and defeating the Byzantine Empire in 1453, made the Knights a priority target. In 1402 they created a stronghold on the peninsula of Halicarnassus (present Bodrum). They used pieces of the partially destroyed Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, to strengthen their rampart, the Petronium. In 1522, an entirely new sort of force arrived: 400 ships under the command of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent delivered 100,000 men to the island (200,000 in other sources). Against this force the Knights, under Grand Master Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, had about 7,000 men-at-arms and their fortifications. The siege lasted six months, at the end of which the surviving defeated Hospitallers were allowed to withdraw to Sicily. Despite the defeat, both Christians and Muslims seem to have regarded the conduct of Phillipe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam as extremely valiant, and the Grand Master was proclaimed a Defender of the Faith by Pope Adrian VI.

Plot summary At the beginning of the story, a community of obese space pirates inhabit the planet Spiegel, but periodically raid other planets for fattening food. At a feast celebrating their raids, the pirates' supreme commander 'Sargon the Great' initiates a new expedition for the three greatest cooks in the galaxy; at the conclusion whereof, the three finalists and their assistants are brought to a grand festival on Spiegel, and ordered to satisfy all the pirates in a contest of their skills, of which the winner's prize is the lifelong position of chief cook to the pirates themselves. Among the finalists are Steve Nickleson (the protagonist of an earlier book) and his assistant Norman Bleistift, whereof Norman serves as first-person narrator of nearly one-half of the text. Ultimately, Steve and Norman win the second prize of 600 pounds of Spiegelian blue garlic and transport home, which Steve later uses to create a \\"bright blue\\" pizza. The first place winner is forced to cook for the pirates forever. Narration The story is told partly in Pinkwater's own narration, and partly by his characters: chiefly Norman Bleistift and Sargon the Great, but secondarily various others including civic officials, flying saucer enthusiasts, and radio-commentators on Earth, and a subordinate of Sargon's on Spiegel.

This causes her mother much grief, as the girl will not name the father. Suspicion in the village rests on a navetanekat, or migrant laborer. He denies any involvement. Nevertheless, one of the brothers of Khar Madaiagua Diob (the expectant mother) tramples the laborer's crops. An angry mob searches for the navetanekat for a few days. Eventually, the girl tells her mother the truth: her own father is also the father of her child.  The Money-Order  The Money-Order centers on an illiterate, middle-aged Senegalese man named Dieng.

Biography = Early life  Phillips was born on October 11, 1922 on a farm between Corinth and Kossuth in Alcorn County, northeastern Mississippi. He was one of five sons and a daughter born to William Thomas Phillips, a farmer of English descent, and Ollie Fare Phillips, a schoolteacher with Scottish and Irish ancestry. The family moved in the 1940s to Kossuth so that the children might gain a better education. After schooling in Kossuth, Phillips attended Hinds Junior College. Phillips served in the United States Navy in the Mediterranean during World War II, after obtaining a degree in social science from Mississippi State University in 1943. After the war, he used the G.I. Bill to finance a master's degree in writing at the University of Alabama, which resulted in a thesis that later became his first novel, The Bitterweed Path. His adviser was Hudson Strode and the thesis won Phillips a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship in 1947 and the Eugene F. Saxton Award in 1948. Upon completion of his degree in 1948, Phillips taught for two years at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. He was able to study in France in 1950 when he was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship.  Writing  Phillips's first novel – The Bitterweed Path – was first published in hardback in 1950 by Rinehart & Company and was advertised, at the time, as \\"something new in the literature dealing with man's love for man ... in a period when even psychologists knew little of such matters, and people in small towns knew nothing.\\" The book depicts the struggles of two gay men in the Southern United States at the turn of the 20th century, and how an unconventional love triangle involving these two men, and one of their fathers, impacts their three marriages in small-town, Deep South. The book's theme was notable in an era of repression, and even more so for coming from a particularly repressive state. Phillips, for whom Corinth-based writer Henry Dalton was a mentor, was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for work in fiction in 1953 and again in 1956. His next four books, including another – Kangaroo Hollow – that had a queer theme, were less successful than the first, even though they were well-received by literary critics. These literary efforts had been in part subsidised by his investment in his brother Frank's trucking business. By the late 1950s, he had given up writing novels and did not return to the field until 2002, when Red Midnight was published.  Politics  Around 1958-1960, Phillips was appointed to the Mississippi Public Service Commission to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of his younger brother, attorney Rubel Phillips. He resigned that post in 1963 so that he could help Rubel in what proved to be an unsuccessful Republican gubernatorial campaign. According to Courtney Chartier, Thomas Phillips managed that campaign and another unsuccessful attempt by Rubel in 1967. However, Jan Stuart says that Thomas wrote speeches and literature for Rubel but was himself a \\"dyed-in-the-wool\\" Democrat: Film and later life The film rights to Phillips's 1955 novel The Loved and the Unloved were sold and in the 1960s, he began working with Hollywood director Robert Altman. He contributed in various capacities to films such as Thieves Like Us (1974, associate producer), The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman and Nashville. He was a consultant for Ode to Billy Joe in 1976, when he was the first chairman of the Mississippi Film Commission. Phillips, who never married, spent much of his post-military life living alternately between California and Corinth, where he usually resided at the Phillips Brothers Truck Stop that he and Frank had opened in 1960. He died on April 3, 2007 in Kossuth, aged 84.

Its purpose is to provide the highest quality conservation services to institutions that do not have in-house conservation facilities or that require specialized expertise and to private collectors. The Center was initiated by the state librarians of the six New England states, who recognized that a multi-state facility was needed. They agreed to cooperate across state lines to create a facility that would serve all non-profit institutions in the region. Given the acute shortage of paper and book conservators and the high cost of equipping a laboratory, a cooperative approach has proven the most effective solution to the problem of making conservation services broadly available. The Center was established with start-up funds from the Council on Library Resources, the New England Library Board, and other donors. For seven years the Center functioned as an arm of the New England Library Board. In 1980, it incorporated as a private, non-profit organization. Since then, the Center’s regional area has been extended to include clients across the country. NEDCC performs book conservation, paper conservation, photograph conservation, Asian paintings conservation, collections surveys, digitization, and audio preservation with the IRENE technology, on a fee-for-service basis to clients nationwide. Through its Preservation Services office, NEDCC also provides preservation needs assessments, training programs including workshops and webinars, consultations, resources, and disaster assistance. NEDCC presents a yearly national conference, Digital Directions, on creating sustainable digital collections. NEDCC has served thousands of non-profit institutions through its laboratory services, consultations and educational programs. Clients range from large institutions such as the National Archives, Boston Public Library, the Baseball Hall of Fame, and Harvard University, to small public libraries, town clerks' offices, and local historical societies. In addition to helping institutions whose major purpose is to serve as repositories, NEDCC assists a wide variety of other organizations. These include performing arts institutions, religious organizations, hospitals, social service agencies, labor unions, zoos, and botanical gardens as well as private and family collectors. Examples of projects undertaken at the Center include the conservation treatment of historic artifacts such as Lewis and Clark’s elk skin journal, the Emancipation Proclamation, and Babe Ruth’s personal scrapbook.

It lies along the 203-CH route to Huahum Pass into Argentina. The town's main economic activities are forestry and, more recently, tourism since the Huilo-Huilo Biological Reserve was created in 1999. During large periods of the 20th century, Neltume was a site of social mobilizations and unrest, events which culminated in 1981 with the crackdown of the \\"Toqui Lautaro\\" guerrilla set of by MIR to fight the military dictatorship in Chile. History=Settlement and founding of Neltume (1898–1944) The area of Neltume was colonized in the first decades of the 20th century as part of the economic boom that the wood industry was experiencing in Chile at that time. The humid and forested areas of Neltume had not had any recorded human occupation until those years as native Mapuches lived rather on the lake shores of Calafquén, Panguipulli and Riñihue Lakes and visited sporadically the eastern parts of these lakes for gathering food. In 1885 Panguipulli became settled by the first non- indigenous persons and on 1898 a small forestry enterprise was installed in Neltume. In 1942, an engineered wood plant is installed in Neltume. Before the gravel road to Neltume built the town relied on steam boat transport across Panguipulli Lake. Social unrest (1945–1973) Neltume got its first police station in 1945 when one of the fundos (country estates) that were part of the Echavarri y Bravo company became subject of unrest and mobilization for social demands among lumberjacks and campesinos. Ponciano del Pino, Elizabeth Jelin, Luchas locales, comunidades e identidades, p. 117. The campesinos were strongly repressed by authorities and some 20 families were expelled from the zone. In 1951 there was another strike among sawmill and forestry workers, who tried to form a trade union and demanded higher salaries, as consequence about 40 leaders and their families were driven out of Neltume. Witnesses from this period record people being taken to Valdivia by Carabineros and estimates the duration of the strike in three months. The same witness states that Carabineros were asked by the sawmill boss to gun any striker found walking around in nighttime. The repression of this movement was according to historians Pino and Jelin so strong that only in the 1960s and during the Unidad Popular government did the workers managed form trade unions in the zone. In 1971 after several land occupations informally known as Operación ardillas (Spanish for Operation Squirrels) the Unidad Popular government expropriated the fundo Carranes from the Sociaded Agrícola y Maderera de Neltme creating the Complejo Maderero Panguipulli merging with it other expropriated lands reaching an area of 360.000 ha of wooded terrain. Ponciano del Pino, Elizabeth Jelin, Luchas locales, comunidades e identidades, p. 118. Property in Liquiñe and Chihuío, localities outside the proper Neltume area, were also placed under the Complejo Maderero Panguipulli. In 1972 president Salvador Allende visited Neltume. On September 2, 1973, 9 days before the 1973 Chilean coup d'etat conservative newspaper El Mercurio wrote that the Chilean Air Force had found strangers in a \\"zone called Neltume\\" which the newspaper imprecisely described as lying east of Puerto Saavedra and south of Cautín River. El Mercurio also stated that the case was very similar to what happened in Bolivia comparing it with Che Guevara's camp in Mancahuazú, and said that local Mapuches had denounced their [the leftists] presence after they became subjects of unjust demands on behalf of the left-wing militants. Ponciano del Pino, Elizabeth Jelin, Luchas locales, comunidades e identidades, page 120. Assault on carabineros station (1973) After hearing the news about the 11 September coup MRC (Spanish acronym for Revolutionary Campesino Movement), a group formed with help of MIR, decided to take actions against the police station in Neltume as a first step to defend the Unidad Popular government. The idea of the MRC was to take control of the building, have the police to surrender, making them join the revolt and seize any weapons to be found there. People from MCR gathered all weapons they could find, four rifles and some shotguns, and prepared dozens of molotov cocktails and home-made grenades. The assault was launched at 02.00 in the night, September 12. The attackers were between 60 and 80 men. Jorge Durán Delgado, a former MIR militant that was 19 years old when he participated in the assault on the police station, remembers these moments: \\"Pepe shouted at them to surrender, to not fear for the lives. To [surrender and] fight together with us to defend to government of Allende\\" Benito Carrasco Riffo, by then commandant of the police station, said that they shouted back: \\"We don't surrender, carabineros does not surrender mierda!\\" The four carabineros inside the police station had two SIG automatic rifles and two carabines with which they answered the fire from the MRC. The police station was a rustic tree building but was enough to resist the weak firepower of the assailants, and rain prevented the Molotov cocktails to put the structure on fire. Inside the police station were also the wives and children of the carabineros. Corporal Juan Campos in the police station asked for help to the police station in Choshuenco some 20 km west and shouted desperately though the radio: \\"Send the aerial cavalry!\\" At around 03.00 a reinforcement of four carabineros arrived on a pickup truck. These reinforcements erroneously fired at carabineros at first, and by the time they had arrived, the attack was almost over and the MCR people had retired. =Aftermath= Nobody died in the assault and the police station did not suffer considerable damage. The police attempted to identify the weapons used but the investigation could not find any of the bullets fired against the station. In October 1973, 12 people were executed in Valdivia for these actions and \\"guerrilla activities\\" in Neltume.Neltume en la memoria, La Nación. Published on 20 April 2003. Reviewed on 18 September 2009. On November 3, 1973 three young men were condemned in a court martial to death for their participation in the assault. In 1990 General Bravo qualified the execution of the three men as \\"terrible\\" as there had not been any proof of their participation in the assault. In the days around September 18, Chile's national day, of 1973 paratroop commandos under Alejandro Medina Lois searched through the Neltume zone in search for the leader of MCR, Comandante Pepe, who was captured and some days later executed by the Caravan of Death.

During the 1973 events in Neltume villager Luís Ancapi is reported to have survived a death flight by falling into a \\"mattress\\" of Chusquea quila.  Guerrilla (1980–1981) MIR newspaper El Rebelde saying; Neltume, Spark of Rebellion During the military dictatorship in Chile the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR in Spanish) drew up plans for a popular guerrilla war in southern Chile. They sought to create a focus of resistance inspired by the Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement in the Sierra Maestra. The area of Neltume was chosen due to the presence of an indigenous Mapuche population and \\"a large and explosive rural proletariat\\" among the sawmill workers of Neltume. It was also considered convenient that the place was close to the cities of Valdivia, Temuco and Osorno. Los que retornaron para luchar On 12 July 1980, the MIR sent the first unit of its newly formed guerrilla group \\"Destacamento Toqui Lautaro\\" into the mountainous area around Neltume. Most of the guerrillas had been detained in 1973 following the 1973 Chilean coup d'état and had to enter illegally into Chile from their exile countries aboard. The foco was discovered by the authorities in July 1981 when it had been active for less than one year. The Chilean army succeeded in isolating the group by August 1981 and in October of the same year its last members were captured. Three guerrillas are claimed to have been captured, tortured, and executed. Another six died in combat and during ambushes. Two more were captured in neighboring areas in Argentina, and were transferred to Chile in accordance with Operation Condor. Selling of state property (1987–1990) During the last years of the Pinochet dictatorship, between 1987 and 1990, large portions of land that were formerly part of the Complejo Forestal y Maderero Panguipulli were sold under obscure circumstances to Chilean billionaires, among them Andrónico Luksic, whose family now owns Fundo Chanchan and Fundo Enco along Enco River and other properties around Neltume. Another wealthy businessman, Víctor Petermann, took control of Fundo Huilo- Huilo in the 1990s and established the luxurious Huilo-Huilo Biological Reserve dedicated to both ecotourism and preservation of biodiversity.

He was a member of a family employed by the Admiralty board, and his greatest work was his renovation and expansion of the Admiralty building. He studied in the Petersburg Academy of Fine Arts from 1767 to 1782 with Alexander Kokorinov and Ivan Starov, and then in Paris from 1782 to 1786 with Jean Chalgrin. In 1794, he became a full Academician at the Petersburg Academy of Fine Arts. In addition to the Admiralty building, he constructed several buildings in Gatchina and other towns neighboring Saint Petersburg.Большой советской энциклопедии. Захаров Андреян Дмитриевич  The Admiralty  In 1805, Zakharov was appointed Chief Architect of the Department of the Navy.Храбрый И. С. Санкт-Петербург Три века архитектуры. СПб: Норинт. 1999. 65 с. His focus was on conducting the management of buildings; including the design, and construction of civil, and industrial buildings. Reconstruction of the building of the Admiralty became the first task of the architect at this post. Admiralty, Saint Petersburg. The Admiralty building in Saint Petersburg is the greatest monument of Russian architecture in the empire style. It is a symbol of the Saint Petersburg and is the architectural center of the city. Zakharov preserved the plan configuration of the preexisting building, the initial building was of 1738, by architect I. K. Korobov. From 1806 to 1823, Zakharov created a new, grandiose construction, with the main facade extending 407 meters, and a majestic architectural appearance that emphasised its central position in the city with arterials converging from it in three rays. In the center of the building is a monumental spired tower, which became the symbol of the city. Zakharov preserved this old spire by Korobov and flanked it with two new neoclassical wings. The composition of twin winged facades with smooth walls, strongly protruding porticoes, and deep loggias is symmetrically located along the sides of the tower, creating a complex rhythmical alternation of simple and clear volumes. The building's sculptures added additional value and significance. Decorative reliefs were integrated organically with the large architectural volumes, sculptural groups along the walls emphasise the human scale in contrast to the immensely expanded facades. In the interior of the Admiralties, the vestibule with the main stairway, the meeting halls, and the library were preserved. The austerity of the monumental architectural forms was softened by the abundance of light and by the exceptional refinement of finishing.  Other work  The earliest works by Zakharov were several buildings in Gatchina such as the Lutheran Church of Saint Peter, Gorbaty bridge, Lviniy bridge, and an aviary.Т.Ф. Родионова.

In addition to the Gatchina projects were the development of Vasilievsky Island in Petersburg, and the reconstruction of the building of the Petersburg Academy of Science in 1803–1804. This was executed in the tradition of the French school of town planning, where the unity of the ensemble was reached by creating a rhythm of the arrangement of buildings with similar architectural details. At this time Zakharov prepared the architectural plans for the Nizhniy Novgorod fair, which were realized by the architect Agustín de Betancourt in the following years. Zakharov created projects for developing buildings on Proviantskii island (1806–1808) and Gakernyi port (1806–1809), a number of projects for Kronstadt (St. Andrew's Cathedral, built in 1806–1817, which has since been demolished), projects for public structures and churches for the provinces, counties, and cities of Russia with a pronouncedly monumental disposition. The cathedrals in Dnipropetrovsk and Izhevsk both derive from Zakharov's cathedral in Kronstadt. Beginning in 1787 he taught at the Academy of Fine Arts, and among his students was the architect A. I. Melnikov.

History The town of Adkins was named for William Adkins Jones who donated land for a flag station on the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway in the late 1800s. He owned a general store and was the first Adkins postmaster when a post office was established there in 1896. In the early 1900s the town had a population of about a hundred, two churches, and a school. After the rail line was abandoned and the major highways by-passed the town, the population steadily declined. In 1915 the post office was moved to nearby Sayers, however the post office and postal area are still called Adkins, even though almost nothing of the original town now remains. The town is still recognized today as an actual city, as is located in part of Bexar County, TX and in Wilson County, TX.

The metal bar (bottom) is a keeper. A magnet keeper, also known historically as an armature, is a bar made from magnetically soft iron or steel, which is placed across the poles of a permanent magnet to help preserve the strength of the magnet by completing the magnetic circuit; it is important for magnets that have low magnetic coercivity, such as alnico magnets (0.07T). Keepers also have a useful safety function, as they stop external metal being attracted to the magnet. Many magnets do not need a keeper, such as supermagnets, as they have very high coercivities; only those with lower coercivities, meaning that they are more susceptible to stray fields, require keepers. A magnet can be considered as the sum of many little magnetic domains, which may be only a few microns or smaller in size. Each domain carries its own small magnetic field, which can point in any direction. When all the domains are pointing in the same direction, the fields add up, yielding a strong magnet. When these all point in random directions, they cancel each other, and the net magnetic field is zero. In magnets with lower coercivities, the direction in which the magnetic domains are pointing is easily swayed by external fields, such as the Earth's magnetic field or perhaps by the stray fields caused by flowing currents in a nearby electrical circuit. Given enough time, such magnets may find their domains randomly oriented, and hence their net magnetization greatly weakened. A keeper for low-coercivity magnets is just a strong permanent magnet that keeps all the domains pointing the same way and realigns those that may have gone astray.

History  There are many descriptions of the small horses of the Marba-Musey people of the flood-plain of the middle reaches of the Logone River in south-western Chad and northern Cameroon; among them are those of Dixon Denham in 1826 and Gustav Nachtigal in 1880.

In 2007 the Poney du Logone population in Chad was listed as \\"not at risk\\" by the FAO. In Cameroon the breed is considered a relic of the past, and to be at risk of extinction.  Characteristics  The head of the Poney du Logone is not heavy, as is sometimes reported, but is well proportioned, with a slightly convex profile and wide nostrils. The principal coat colour is bay, followed by bay roan, chestnut and chestnut roan. The Poney du Logone is one of two horse breeds reported to show tolerance of, or resistance to, tsetse-borne trypanosomosis, or \\"sleeping sickness\\".

Iran used Basij militiamen armed with Kalashnikovs and RPG-7s, the Army's 77th Mechanized Division of Khorasan equipped with M47 and M48 tanks, 106mm recoilless rifle, 130mm and 230mm artillery, supported by attack helicopters, and Pasdaran's 31st Ashura Division which was armed with captured Iraqi tanks. Prelude As Operation Karbala-5 was launched to capture the city of al- Basra, the Operations Karbala-6 at Qasr Shirin and Karbala-7 in Iraqi Kurdistan were launched to stop the Iraqis from transferring units to their defense lines in Basra. It was meant to divert Iraqi armor away from the city during the Karbala-5 attack. For the Operation around 10,000 Basij volunteers, 1 regular army division and 1 Pasdaran division were used for this offensive. The Basijis were lined up early in the morning and sent on offence earlier than was planned because the enemy was expecting something. The battle 10,000 Basij volunteers attacked. As they advanced, the Iraqis abandoned their positions. Iraqi troops then counter-attacked with armor and surrounded the Basij, who were only armed with Kalashnikovs and RPG-7s. The Basij forces broke through the Iraqi lines. However, an Iraqi counterattack encircled the Basij forces in a pocket. Many Basij volunteers were killed in the fighting with the surrounding Iraqi troops. Immediately, the Iranian 77th 'Khorasan\\" mechanized division and the 31st 'Ashoora' mechanized division attacked the Iraqi forces. Iraqi forces suffered heavy losses. The Iranian 77th mechanized division broke through the encirclement, defeating the Iraqis and relieving the Basijis. Aftermath Eventually, while initially successful, the Iranian offensive petered out because it was not meant to be a breakthrough attack, due to shortages of logistics, and Iraqi chemical weapons. The offensive, while successfully diverting much of Iraq's armor away from the battlefield in Basra, did not prevent the Iraqis from stopping the Iranian attack against the city.

(It is Li's first feature film since his 2003 debut Blind Shaft.) It is also known as Road Home.Not to be confused with Zhang Yimou's 1999 film, The Road Home. Like Li's previous film, Blind Shaft, which dealt with the notoriously dangerous mining industry, Blind Mountain turns a sharply critical eye towards another one of China's continuing social problems: selling women for marriage.  Plot  Blind Mountain follows a young woman, Bai Xuemei, in the early 1990s who is looking for work to fund her brother's education and pay off her parents' debts after they paid for her to go through college. After a month of fruitless searching, some people offer her a well paid job; however, this is a trick and instead they drug her and then pretend to be her family and sell her as a bride to a villager in the Qin Mountains of China's Shaanxi province. Trapped in the fiercely traditional village, where her documents have been taken away and she is physically restrained at times, the young woman finds her avenues of escape are blocked. As she searches for allies, including a boy, a school teacher and a mailman, she experiences rape by her \\"husband\\" and beatings at the hands of the villagers, her husband, and his parents.  Cast  * Huang Lu as Bai Xuemei, the heroine, a young college graduate * Yang You'an as Huang Degui, a villager who purchases Bai Xuemei * Zhang Yuling as Ding Xiuying, Huang Degui's mother * He Yunie as Huang Decheng, a local teacher and Huang Degui's cousin * Jia Yinggao as Huang Changyi, Huang Degui's father * Zhang Youping as Li Qingshan, a local boy who befriends Bai Xuemei  Production history  The film was primarily funded by private, overseas Chinese donors. The cast was primarily non-professional actors with the notable exception of the lead, Huang Lu, who was cast from the Beijing Film Academy before she had even graduated. Before its release, Blind Mountain suffered from nearly 20 state-imposed cuts. This was done for the film to be allowed into the Un certain regard competition at Cannes by Chinese officials, as several of the cuts were of scenes that were critical of certain aspects of Chinese society. The Chinese Film Bureau policy also led to Li filming alternate versions of the film's ending including a more upbeat one specifically for a possible video or DVD release in China. Reception Along with Diao Yi'nan's Night Train, Blind Mountain was one of only two Chinese films in competition in the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, both for the Prix un certain regard. A third Chinese film, Fengming, a Chinese Memoir by Wang Bing was a documentary and was a \\"Special Screening\\" not in competition. Blind Mountain ultimately failed to win anything at Cannes, with the Prix un certain regard going instead to Cristian Nemescu's California Dreamin'. While the audience at Cannes gave a standing ovation to Blind Mountain when it was screened, the critics have been mixed in their reaction. Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter, for example, is generous in his praise of the film's social message and visual beauty, claiming that the Li \\"draws wonderful performances from a cast that includes local amateurs and professionals, including the utterly credible Huang Lu.\\" In contrast, Derek Elley of Variety was far more subdued in his reaction, and in particular criticizes the thin story and poorly drawn characters, such that \\"there's little emotional underpinning to the rote story.\\" What both critics agreed was above par, however, was the photography of the Taiwanese cinematographer Jong Lin. Other critics expressed sentiments similar to Elley but nevertheless found the performances effective, particularly by the lead actress. Reception was more positive with the Chinese press. Writing in Hong Kong cultural magazine, Muse, Perry Lam observed, 'What makes this film so heartbreaking and so hard to watch sometimes is its determination to let us experience without varnish the depths of the heroine's despair and meet all the wretched characters who have a role to play in her tragedy.' On April 19, 2008, Blind Mountain won the Film Award of the Council of Europe (FACE), which is presented at the Istanbul International Film Festival by the Council of Europe to a film that raises public awareness and interest in human rights issues and promotes a better understanding of their significance.

[Retrieved 25 Sept. 2018]  Alternate version  Blind Mountain was filmed with several endings to satisfy the Chinese film censorship board. The rather short and abrupt ending in the international DVD has the main character of Bai Xuemei stabbing the \\"husband,\\" who forcefully married and raped her, during a personal brawl with Xuemei's father after the police leaves the village. The ending that appears on the Chinese DVD is more of a \\"happy\\" yet ironic ending when the police show up at Bai Xuemei's house days later, drugs and fends off the husband and rescues her. At the same time, other girls who were sold into marriage in the village are rescued, but her best friend (who was also sold into marriage) suddenly decides to stay for her child and gets out of the police car. Bai Xuemei's child is left without a mother, and the family of her \\"husband\\" is left with no daughter-in-law. The ending concludes with text about the ongoing problem of human trafficking in modern-day China. More than 30 cuts were required by Chinese censors for it be approved for exhibition.

Background  During the first stages of the Greek Revolution against the Ottoman Empire, there existed no overall authority over the rebels. Each region separately elected its own assemblies and tried to put together an administration to coordinate the struggle. One of the first such entities was established in eastern continental Greece (\\"Roumeli\\").  History  The uprising began in March, and established itself with the capture of the provincial capital, Salona (modern Amfissa), on 27 March 1821. The Ottoman garrison held out in the citadel until April 10, when the Greeks took it. At the same time, the Greeks suffered a defeat at the Battle of Alamana against the army of Omer Vryonis, which resulted in the death of Athanasios Diakos. But the Ottoman advance was stopped at the inn of Gravia, under the leadership of Odysseas Androutsos, who was subsequently named commander-in-chief of Eastern Greece. Vryonis turned towards Boeotia and sacked Livadia, awaiting reinforcements before proceeding towards the Morea. These forces, 8,000 men under Beyran Pasha, were however met and defeated at the Battle of Vassilika, on August 26. This defeat forced Vryonis too to withdraw, securing both Eastern Greece and the Morea.  The Administration of Eastern Greece  Vryonis' defeat paved the way for the political organization of the freed territories. In 15–20 November 1821, a council was held in Salona, where the main local notables and military chiefs participated. Under the direction of Theodoros Negris, they set down a proto-constitution for the region, the \\"Legal Order of Eastern Continental Greece\\" (Νομική Διάταξις της Ανατολικής Χέρσου Ελλάδος), and established a governing council, the Areopagus, composed of 71 notables from eastern Continental Greece as well as the regions of Thessaly and Macedonia, where the Greek uprisings would soon be suppressed. Officially, the Areopagus was superseded by the central Provisional Administration, established in January 1822 after the First National Assembly, but the council continued its existence and exercised considerable authority, albeit in the name of the national government. However, the relationship was often tense, especially as Greece soon entered a phase of virtual civil war.

The shape of the dress is a shirtwaist with short or elbow-length sleeves. It is named after a dress worn by Ginger Rogers' character in the 1940 film of the same name, designed by Renié. The style has been explained as being deliberately intended for films, the large amount of white around the face reflecting the key light onto the face, giving a well-defined and flattering profile. As a modest and practical style that was easily copied at home, or could even be used to update an old shirtwaist dress to a new fashion by applying a new collar, it became popular during the wartime austerity period. The style has returned to fashion at times since. The designer Jill Richards, herself a Hollywood actress of around the same era, favoured it in her collections of the 1970s, attracting a clientele of names such as Nancy Reagan. This dress has also been adopted more recently as an adaption of the gothic lolita style. It takes the usual gothic lolita themes of modesty, tradition and monochrome colours of a dark base with a light contrast, but applies them to a later period with simpler lines, rather than the more usual antebellum fussy bows and flounces. This style is typified by characters such as Lenore, the Cute Little Dead Girl and Wednesday Addams.

Born on the island of Saparua, Pattimura joined the British army after they took the Maluku islands from the Dutch colonials. When the islands were returned to the Dutch in 1816, he was dismissed. Concerned that the Dutch would implement programs that limited his people, Pattimura led an armed rebellion that captured Fort Duurstede on 16 May 1817. Killing the inhabitants of the fortress and fighting off Dutch reinforcements, on 29 May he was declared the leader of the Maluku people. After being betrayed by the King of Booi Pati Akoon, he was captured by Dutch forces on 11 November and hanged the next month. Pattimura has become a symbol of both Maluku and Indonesian independence, praised by President Sukarno and declared a national hero by President Suharto. He has several namesakes both in the capital of Maluku, Ambon, and in the rest of the Indonesian archipelago. Biography Pattimura was born Thomas Matulessy on 8 June 1783 in Saparua, Maluku; the name Pattimura was his pseudonym. His parents were Frans Matulessia and Fransina Tilahoi, and he had a little brother named Yohanis. In 1810, the Maluku islands were taken over from the Dutch colonials by the British. Mattulessi received military training from their army and reached the rank of sergeant major. After the signing of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty on 13 August 1814, in 1816 the Maluku islands were returned to the Dutch; Pattimura attended the ceremony. Afterwards, in violation of the treaty, he and his fellow soldiers were discharged to their hometowns. However, Pattimura refused to accept the restoration of Dutch power. He felt that they would stop paying native Christian teachers, as they had done in 1810, and was concerned that a proposed switch to paper currency would leave the Maluku people unable to give alms — only coins were considered valid — and thus lead to churches being unable to help the poor. Ambon revolt of 1817 Fort Duurstede, Saparua, Indonesia He was appointed as Kapitan by the people of Saparua to rebel against the Dutch on 14 May 1817. The assault began on the 15th, with Pattimura and his lieutenants Said Perintah, Anthony Reebhok, Paulus Tiahahu and Tiahahu's daughter Martha Christina Tiahahu leading the way. On 16 May 1817, they seized Fort Duurstede and killed the 19 Dutch soldiers, Resident Johannes Rudolph van den Berg (who had arrived just two months earlier), his wife, three of his children and their governess.Peter van Zonneveld (1995)Pattimura en het kind van Saparua. De Molukken-opstand van 1817 in de Indisch-Nederlandse literatuur, Indische Letteren, 10:41-54. The only Dutch survivor was Van den Berg's five-year-old son Jean Lubbert. After the seizure, Pattimura's forces defended the fort and on May 20 defeated Major Beetjes, Second Lieutenant E. S. de Haas, and their nearly 200 troops, leaving only 30 survivors. On 29 May, Pattimura and other Maluku leaders made the Haria Proclamation, which outlined their grievances against the Dutch government and declared Pattimura to be the leader of the Maluku people. In response, Governor-General Van der Cappellen immediately fired the governor of Ambon, Jacobus A. van Middelkoop, and his right hand, Nicolaus Engelhard, for their abuses of the local people.Thomas Matulessy, Kapitan Pattimura Muda On June 1, Pattimura led an unsuccessful attack on Fort Zeelandia in Haruku. Two months later, on August 3, Fort Duurstede was finally retaken by the Dutch, but the revolt had spread and was not subdued for another few months. Due to betrayal from Booi's king, Pati Akoon, and Tuwanakotta, Pattimura was arrested on 11 November 1817 while he was in Siri Sori. He and his fellows were sentenced to death. On 16 December 1817, Pattimura together with Anthony Reebhok, Philip Latumahina, and Said Parintah were hanged in front of in Ambon. Legacy 1,000-rupiah banknote issued by Bank Indonesia. Pattimura and his war have been used as symbols for both Maluku independence, such as with the short- lived Republic of South Maluku, and Indonesian patriotism. The first president of Indonesia, Sukarno, considered Pattimura a great patriot. Pattimura was awarded the title National Hero of Indonesia by President Suharto in 1973 through Presidential Decree number 87/TK. In Ambon, he is commemorated in the names of the University of Pattimura, Pattimura Airport, and a street, as well as a statue; there are also streets named after him throughout the archipelago. 15 May is celebrated as Pattimura Day; a similar, smaller holiday is on 2 January for the younger Tiahahu. He is also featured on the 2000 series of the 1,000 rupiah bill.

A bestseller in 1939 and 1940, it was adapted as a popular 1940 film, and was republished during WWII as an Armed Services Edition. The novel tells of a white-collar girl who falls in love with a young socialite, despite the objections of his family. Contemporary Authors noted: \\"Central to the story is protagonist Kitty's affair with the affluent Wyn Strafford. Critics heatedly debated Morley's sexual sensationalism,\\" notably the main character's out-of-wedlock pregnancy and abortion. The story is told by Kitty in the first person. A sociologist suggests that \\"Kitty, in her observations of the mores and behavior patterns of the upper class acts as the anthropological alter ego of Morley, viewing the upper class from the outside.\\" Kitty Foyle is one of the works for which the publishing firm of J.B. Lippincott is remembered. Radio and television In addition to the very successful 1940 film, Kitty Foyle was also adapted to radio. It was heard on the serialized anthology, Stories America Loves, which was broadcast on CBS from October 6, 1941 to October 2, 1942. The serial of Kitty Foyle, beginning in June 1942 with Julie Stevens in the title role, proved so popular with the listening audience that Stories America Loves was dropped, as the title was simply changed to Kitty Foyle on October 5, 1942. Others in the cast were Bud Collyer and Mark Smith. The series continued until June 9, 1944. The Kitty Foyle television series, starring Kathleen Murray, debuted in 1958 and was telecast on NBC for two seasons. Early reception Margaret Wallace, reviewing the novel in The New York Times, called it \\"sparkling.\\" > There is no use trying to pick good things out of this book. Something on > almost every page clamors for quotation. Wallace says that Morley first thought of calling the novel Nation Wide, showing that \\"he considered its problem national in scope and of social significance.\\" Wallace points to a paragraph from the novel which can be taken as a statement of the problem: > Molly and me had a talk one time about the White Collar Women, there's > millions of them, getting maybe 15 to 30 a week, they've got to dress > themselves right up to the hilt, naturally they have a yen for social > pleasure, need to be a complete woman with all a woman's satisfactions and > they need a chance to be creating and doing. And the men their own age can't > do much for them, also the girls grow up too damn fast because they absorb > the point of view of older people they work for.

What > about the woman of the covered typewriter? What has she got, poor kid, when > she leaves the office? ... [Molly said] \\"Do you know what we are? we're > sharecroppers. We work like nigger hands in a cotton field and give Palmer's > more brainwork than they'd know what to do with and what do we get for it? > Eight hour's sleep, I guess, because that's about all we're fit for.

He successfully fought a charge of obscenity against Britton's controversial book Lord Horror in 1992, the first novel to be banned in England since Hubert Selby Jr.’s Last Exit to Brooklyn in 1967. Career Butterworth started his writing career in 1966 for New Worlds Magazine, the British mouthpiece of the New Wave, under the aegis of editor Michael Moorcock and the journal's later editor Charles Platt. His work for this and various New Wave anthologies shares similarities with his contemporaries, including J G Ballard, who collaborated with him on two pieces of fiction, and William S. Burroughs whom he was later to commission and publish. His publishing career started in 1968 with the small press literary magazines Concentrate, Corridor and Wordworks with Jay Jeff Jones as Associate Editor. At this time he was, in addition, a contributor of fiction and poetry to many small press publications. Butterworth met David Britton in the early seventies through the latter's Manchester-based bookshop The House on the Borderland. After a deal was struck with New English Library, Savoy's early titles were distributed worldwide. The company's models were the fin de siècle magazine The Savoy (hence the name), New Worlds and Weird Tales, and for production style the British publisher Picador and the American houses Ace Books and Lancer Books. The company's initial aim was to release titles in trade format editions by authors that Butterworth & Britton wanted to see kept in print, after which the company moved on to creating its own titles. Savoy Books is one of Michael Moorcock’s principle independent publishers. After the decline of the New Wave and seeking to support his young family as a single parent, in 1976 Butterworth undertook a series of fantasy and television tie-in commissions. The first of these, The Time of the Hawklords, was a fantasy novel categorised as being in the space-rock genre, based on the stage personas of the rock band Hawkwind. A sequel, The Queens Of Deliria, was completed in 1977. Both books were co- credited to Michael Moorcock, who has said that his involvement with the first was negligible and that he had no involvement with the second at all. .Information from Multiverse.org A third novel in the Hawklords trilogy is Ledge of Darkness illustrated by Bob Walker; this was only available as part of a Hawkwind 4 LP retrospective box set '25 Years On' in 1994, which never got proper distribution. He wrote novelizations to the second series of the TV show Space:1999 for ITC Entertainment. This process was frustrated by, having just three weeks to write each novel, access to only four of the scripts and only the prescreening of the first episode.http://catacombs.space1999.net/main/pguide/xnmba.html In 1978, Butterworth co-edited (with Britton) The Savoy Book, an anthology of prose and graphics. Around this time he also became friends with Ian Curtis of Joy Division, through Curtis's interest in William Burroughs. The friendship was to have a bearing on his subsequent career. From 1980 to 1997, ‘clean-up’ campaigner Police Chief Constable of Manchester, James Anderton, targeted Savoy Books and their Manchester-based retail outlets. Multiple raids were made, with charges of obscenity being brought against the company and its directors. Butterworth mounted a concerted fight-back, his aim being to bring to wider attention the misuse of Section Three of the Obscene Publications Act, where publications of literary merit were being seized and destroyed without a jury trial. This did not, however, prevent Britton being sentenced to twenty-eight days in Strangeways Prison, Manchester, in May 1982, the first of two such jail sentences Britton received for publishing books. Nor did it prevent the eventual destruction of thousands of graphic editions of Lord Horror and Meng & Ecker seized by the police in related raids. The appeal mounted for these was hampered by the prosecution's plea of Public Interest Immunity when the defence asked them to say why they thought Butterworth & Britton were not serious publishers. The sitting magistrate, Janet Hayward, allowed the plea. As against a ‘disreputable publishing house’, therefore, a jury trial was disallowed and the charge of obscenity was upheld. The charge was then upheld at appeal, in the Divisional Courts in London. In 1984, Butterworth co-edited Savoy Dreams (again with Britton), a sequel to The Savoy Book. This contained, as well as fiction and graphics, Butterworth's account of the police activity and court case leading to Britton's first imprisonment. In 1989, Butterworth contributed to, and edited, Britton's highly controversial novel Lord Horror. Containing a parody of Chief Constable Anderton, the book was instantly seized by police. It was found obscene at the novel's trial in 1991. The case was contested by Butterworth, who sought the help of human rights organisation Article 19. In July 1992, at a court of appeal, the charge was overturned, in a defence led by Geoffrey Robertson QC. From 1989 (to present), Butterworth has been the editor of all Britton's Lord Horror novels as well as the Lord Horror graphic spin-offs and Meng & Ecker graphic series. In 2006, while continuing to co-run Savoy Books, Butterworth re-established his independent credentials, experimenting first with print-on- demand under the imprint Michael Butterworth Books. In the same year, at the request of Space 1999 fan and publisher Mateo Latosa he rewrote his novelisations of the TV series Space 1999: Year Two, revising and re-ordering the stories to bring them into line with the broadcast series and making a consistent Space:1999 universe. The collection included a novelisation of the episode, \\"The Taybor\\", which had not been included in the original books. The omnibus edition was published as a limited edition hardcover by Powys Media. From 2011, he has been contributing short fiction and poetry to Emanations, the annual anthology edited by Carter Kaplan and published by International Authors. Running August to September 5, 2014, Butterworth staged the exhibition Use and Abuse of Books.http://www.mancunianmatters.co.uk/content/160870252-last-author-banned- obscene-comes-out-hiding-manchester-exhibition-boundary-pushing In 2016 Butterworth began a series of memoirs. The first, \\"The Blue Monday Diaries: In the Studio With New Order\\", is an account of his time spent with the band in the early nineteen-eighties. The book also contains a picture of alternate Manchester at that time. Other volumes are planned to follow.

Pushed by Eugénie Brazier's encouragements, he applied to work in 1976 with Claude Peyrot, the chef and owner of the Vivarois (a Michelin three star restaurant) on avenue Victor Hugo in Paris. In 1981, he opened his own restaurant quai de la Tournelle (at the crossing with rue de Bièvres) in Paris. In 1986, he opened L'Ambroisie at place des Vosges and obtained three Michelins stars in 1988 which he has kept since then. His refined and classical cooking style makes it one on the most esteemed French restaurants. Bernard Pacaud rarely comes into the public's sight because he devotes himself to cuisine in the kitchen. Bernard Pacaud deeply values the quality of ingredients. When he first opened the restaurant, ingredient costs caused him to run a deficit. He has been described as following traditional processes of making food, taking the utmost care in dishes, and presenting every plate as an elegant art. He frequently combines multiple food in one dish. Bernard Pacaud passed over the restaurant to his son Mathieu in 2012 but continues to pays close attention and makes sure the restaurant maintains its high-level service and quality.

It is owned by Cumulus Media and airs a classic hits radio format branded as \\"96.9 The Wolf.\\" WIWF leans toward classic rock, and does not play pop or dance artists such as Michael Jackson or Madonna, who are typically heard on most classic hits stations. The syndicated John Boy & Billy show, from Premiere Networks, is heard weekday mornings on WIWF, with local DJs heard the rest of the day. WIWF's studios are located in North Charleston. WIWF's transmitter tower is off Seewee Road in Awendaw.Radio-Locator.com/WIWF It is powered at 99,000 watts (100,000 with beam tilt).FCC.gov/WIWF The antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) is 539 meters (1,758 feet). With a good radio, WIWF can be heard from Myrtle Beach to Hilton Head Island. History The station signed on the air April 1, 1948, as WCSC-FM, the FM sister to WCSC-AM (now WSPO).Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 268 WCSC-FM was Charleston's second FM station, going on the air a year after WTMA-FM (now WSSX). WCSC-AM-FM were CBS Radio Network affiliates, simulcasting CBS's schedule of dramas, comedies, news and sports. As network programming moved from radio to television, WCSC- AM-FM switched to a full service middle of the road format of popular adult music, news and sports. In the late 1960s, the Federal Communications Commission began requiring FM stations to end their simulcasts; WCSC-FM would switch to a beautiful music format. To give it a separate identity from WCSC, the FM station became WXTC-FM in 1973, calling itself \\"Ecstasy.\\" In the 1990s, WXTC-FM switched to soft adult contemporary, then later flipped to smooth jazz (as WJZK). In 1997, the format would switch again, this time to 1970s hits, and adopt the WSUY call letters. The format would shift to adult contemporary in the 2000s. On October 11, 2007, after a day of redirecting listeners to sister station WSSX, WSUY dropped the AC format and flipped to country music as \\"96.9 The Wolf.\\" This came shortly before Citadel Broadcasting moved its Charleston country outlet, WNKT, into the Columbia, South Carolina radio market. With the change to The Wolf, Citadel Broadcasting had a country music station in the Charleston market, even after WNKT relocated, to compete with rival country music station WEZL, owned by Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia). However, the changes left Charleston without any adult contemporary-formatted stations. Shortly after the flip to country, the WSUY call letters were changed to WIWF. (WXLY would soon became an adult contemporary station.) Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. On February 3, 2014, WIWF, along with nine other Cumulus owned country music stations, made the switch to the \\"Nash FM\\" branding.cumulus- adds-11-more-nashfms Jessica Chandler and Jay Shadix moved to afternoons as their morning show was replaced by America's Morning Show.

It is located northwest of Yellowknife and to the northwest of the Back River from which it takes its name. The volcano constitutes the Back Group of the Yellowknife Supergroup and is somewhat anomalous in the Slave craton because it has undergone only a low degree of deformation and is subhorizontal. The southern half of the complex is exposed at the crest of a small dome. This is the eroded portion of the stratovolcano that has been preserved in an upright position. The complex comprises four volcanic sedimentary sequences (Innerring, Thlewyco, Boucher-Regan, Kelsh) that correspond to the phases of growth and destruction of this stratovolcano.  Innerring  The Innerring sequence, which constitutes the oldest rocks of the complex, represents the upper part of an eroded early phase of the volcano (U-Pb zircon igneous age of 2.708 Gigaannum (Ga)).  Thlewyco  The Thlewyco sequence represents the main construction phase of the volcano and forms an outward dipping, annular succession around the Innerring sequence, with an aggregate thickness of -. Its stratigraphy changes dramatically around the crater, varying from five cycles of andesitic and rhylotic lava, followed by succession of volcanistic debris on the north side, to 30 subaerial andesitic flows and rare pyroclastic and epivolcaniclastic units on the eastern side, to interlayered dacitic and andesitic lava and tuff overlain by a thick succession of voluminous, nonwelded, ash-flow tuff and volcaniclastic rocks on the south side. Volcanism in this sequence ended with the eruption of large rhyolite and dacite dome-flow complexes (U-Pb zircon dated at 2.692 Ga). The Innerring and Thlewycho sequences represent a complex history of explosive eruptions from numerous eruptive centers.  Boucher-Regan  The Boucher- Regan sequence, with its predominance of pillowed lava flows, suggests that this northern flank of the volcano was submerged during deposition.  Kelsh  The Kelsh sequence on the northwestern side comprises epiclastic volcarenite, rhyolite-dacite block breccia from lava domes, polymict breccia, and a conglomerate of andesite, dacite-rhyolite clasts, and andesitic tuff. The exposed succession consists of iron-formation, oolitic-stromatolitic carbonate, sulphidic volcaniclastic rocks and graphitic slate that marks the end of volcanism. The Kelsh sequence forms a broad apron that is interpreted as a shallow, submarine to subaerial, clastic fan derived by degradation of the volcanic pile (U-Pb zircon dated at 2.586 Ga).  Age  Age determinations in the Black River complex are similar to the ages of volcanic rock found in the upper Kam Group of the Yellowknife greenstone belt as well as other volcanic centers in the western Slave province. Detrital zircon geochronology on turbiditic sequences confirm a secondary deposition of turbidite units at ca. 2.62-2.60 Ga that was widespread throughout the Slave province.

Synopsis=Setting A nuclear terrorist attack occurs in Saudi Arabia in 2016, killing six million people and crippling the supply of oil from the Middle East, plunging the world into an unprecedented energy crisis. The following year, the United States and the European Union sign the historic SLAMS (Space-Land-Air Missile Shield) Treaty, agreeing to co-develop technologies for a comprehensive, interlocking anti-ballistic missile system. The US and EU test-launch nuclear salvos against each other, which the SLAMS weapons completely destroy. Emboldened by the success of the tests, the US and the EU pronounce \\"the end of strategic nuclear warfare,\\" and the world celebrates a new age of peace. With the price of crude oil at USD $800 a barrel, the EU member states are forced to consolidate political, economic, and military power to form a united European superstate, the European Federation (EF), which has a greater population and Gross National Product (GNP) than the US. The United Kingdom and Ireland opt not to join the new state, however, and instead form their own union known as the \\"New Commonwealth,\\" which remains neutral but allows European forces to man the missile defense uplink sites on its territory. As EF membership is restricted to only the richest entities in Europe, nations too weak to join the EF, notably those in the Balkans and Eastern Europe, collapse completely and are subsequently taken over by Russia, who refer to it as \\"their land.\\"EndWar:Russian Campaign; when fighting in Istra, Croatia, a Russian officer will refer to this territory as being Russian The US and the EF regard each other's power as a threat to their own, and the fractured former allies embark on a costly space arms race with each other. Russia, being the world's number one supplier of natural gas and crude oil, enjoys a massive economic boom as a result of the worldwide energy crisis. Its newfound wealth is spent on modernizing its military, creating its own missile defense system, and utilizing its power to influence world events. The militarization of space reaches its peak in 2020, when the US reveals plans to launch the Freedom Star space station in an effort to regain its position as the premier world superpower. While partly designed for civilian research purposes, the station will also house three companies of US Marines, who can deploy anywhere on Earth within ninety minutes. International reaction is very hostile, particularly from both Russia and the EF, who see the space station as a way in which the United States could neutralize their portion of anti-ballistic defenses and upset the balance of power. The EF withdraws from the already divided NATO in protest, causing the organization to collapse. Former NATO bases and facilities in Europe, such as Ramstein Air Base, are subsequently taken over by the EF.  Prelude to War  The prelude to war takes place before World War III and explains how the conflict began. On March 23, 2020, EF uplink sites in the \\"lawless zone,\\" where Croatia used to be, are attacked by an as-yet unidentified group of terrorists, who are using T-80 tanks, from a beached cargo ship. They are repulsed by EF Enforcers Corps (EFEC) forces. During the battle, the EF attempts to gain access to the cargo ship that the terrorists use, but the ship is destroyed before they can gain access. Details of the attack are kept secret. On April 4, 2020, when the final module of the Freedom Star is set to launch from Kennedy Space Center amid international outcry, the same group of terrorists attack the module and attempt to destroy it, using the same methods as the Croatian attack. Once again they are repulsed, this time by the United States Joint Strike Force (JSF) as reports of yet another terrorist attack come in, this time of an assault on the Rozenburg petrol plant in the Netherlands. After being defeated by EFEC forces, the terrorists identify themselves as the \\"Forgotten Army,\\" composed of people from a collection of failed states in the Balkans, Africa, and South America. Following a final terrorist attack, this time on a Russian power plant near Minsk (an attack which the Russians had been aware of beforehand, but played along with for aesthetic purposes), the US finds \\"conclusive evidence\\" that the EF's defense minister, François Pulain, funded the Forgotten Army with modern military equipment. Suspecting there to be a conspiracy within the European government to prevent the completion of the Freedom Star, the Americans send a black ops team to abduct Pulain while he inspects the uplink network in Copenhagen, the site of the EF's main naval base. They manage to capture him, but an anonymous call by Russia informs the police of Denmark, allowing EFEC forces to prevent extraction and trap the team in one of the uplinks. On April 7, 2020, the US crashes Copenhagen's uplinks and sends in JSF units to rescue the trapped team. The US successfully repels the EFEC's first attack, but European forces are able to counterattack and reboot Copenhagen's uplinks in their favor. The JSF forces are forced to surrender and are allowed safe passage back to the US in exchange for releasing Pulain. The events in Copenhagen spark a major international incident, but the US and EF stop just short of declaring war. As last-minute peace talks are arranged to be held on neutral ground in London, it is revealed (to the player only) that Russia funded the Forgotten Army's attacks and planted the evidence against Pulain, citing the need to keep the EF and the US from uniting in order to take Russia's oil. To ensure that war is sparked between the two powers, elements of Russia's Spetsnaz Guard Brigade (SGB) embark on a covert operation, disguised as Forgotten Army soldiers, to upload a virus into the European SLAMS network at Rovaniemi Airport in Finland. The virus causes an EF orbital laser satellite to shoot down the new Freedom Lifter module during liftoff, thinking it to be an ICBM. The entire crew is killed, and news reports blaming problems from \\"malfunction\\" to \\"terrorist hijacking\\" to (finally) \\"EF satellite.\\" This final act starts a war between the two powers. Russia initially joins the US under the guise of \\"aiding it in its crusade against Europe\\" and invades EF-controlled Poland, but the Americans see this as an attempt to reform the Eastern Bloc and then attack Russia. World War III has begun. World War III World War III is an open-ended part of the story where the player chooses their faction and character and tries to take all three capitals or 28 battlefields. The campaign plays much like Prelude to War with a few additional options. During World War III, between battles, the player has the option to choose between several battle locations. The battles that the player did not choose will be fought by the machine. Also, battles lost or quit by players cannot be replayed and the territory is lost, whereas in Prelude to War, players could retry each battle until successful. Players may upgrade their chosen battalion, with improved attack, defense, mobility, and ability characteristics. At the conclusion of each campaign battle a summary screen is shown. This screen includes information including number of battalion units promoted, amount of credits (money) received, command rating, medals, mission duration, and a quote by a famous military leader. The player can gain a more in depth understanding of the battle summary by viewing the details screens, which provide a breakdown of statistics, ranking, etc. During the course of the war, several background situations arise, such as adverse weather, conditions like typhoons causing people to become homeless and rescue teams being dispatched. There are also reports of protest against the war from around the world as well as by individual figures such as the Pope. These parts of the story are told via television reports. They also report the sinking of enemy shipping by airstrikes and weapons of mass destruction. As the war progresses, the leader of an opposing nation survives an assassination attempt, around Turn 15. When the war has ended, the winning faction takes control of the world and a special scene is shown, which shows the winning faction's flag and troops parading with the voice of the faction's general talking about their victory and what will happen in the future. Depending on whether it is United States, Europe or Russia that is the winning side, the cutscene is different due to different speeches by generals and different reasons for starting the war. Locations In an IGN interview, De Plater said the setting of EndWar (as a possible series, but now cancelled due to poor sales) is a global battle, but the first installment is focused on the North Atlantic theater of battle: Europe, Russia, and North America. Players will hear reports of events in other parts of the world, such as reactions to the war by the Pope and various other countries, as well as actions in the war that the player takes no part in. Gameplay Imp Rebs has confirmed 4x4 will be offered in the full version. De Plater confirmed the game to be a Real-time tactics strategy war game. Units will gain experience as they are used in battle. The emphasis will be more on smaller scale battles rather than the overarching campaign. Ubisoft also claims that the game is \\"completely controllable through voice commands.\\" This is demonstrated on a handful of gameplay videos by de Plater himself. The voice commands can be input through any headset that works with the console/computer the player is using. Factions There are three playable factions in EndWar: * The European Federation Enforcer Corps (EFEC), which is made up of veteran elite counter- terrorist and peacekeeping forces throughout Europe, especially skilled in urban warfare. While their units are slightly less armored, they are faster than those of either the JSF or SGB. They also excel in electronic warfare, as well as advanced directed energy and microwave weapons. Their ranks notably contain many previous members of the elite counter-terrorist unit, Rainbow. Their WMD (weapon of mass destruction) is an Orbital Tactical High Energy Laser. * The Russian Federation Spetsnaz Guards Brigade (SGB), which is composed of veterans of Russia's many regional conflicts, specializing in heavy weapons and heavy armor. They believe in winning at all costs, while still saving face. A few Rainbow veterans from Eastern Europe serve as Battalion commanders. Their WMD is a Fuel-Air Missile / Vacuum bomb, as are many of the 'special weapon' upgrades for units - e.g.: engineers and tanks gain access to flamethrowers, while artillery and gunships make use of fuel- air weaponry. * The United States Joint Strike Force (JSF), led by Ghost Recon main character Scott Mitchell, is modeled after today's Marine Expeditionary Units. The J.S.F. is built around small units packing a precise punch, and is made up of elite servicemen from all branches of the United States Armed Forces. They also specialize in access to state-of-the-art stealth technology and battlefield robotics, such as UAVs and automated sentry drones. Their WMD is a Kinetic Strike. A few veteran Ghost Recon members serve as battalion commanders. Units There are seven types of units available for direct command: riflemen, engineers, tanks, transports, helicopter gunships, artillery, and command vehicles. Troops which have been with the player for many battles will be more effective than fresh recruits. De Plater, Creative Director, says this creates a \\"Pokémon-like\\" ownership of the player's units and will have a large effect on his tactics. \\"It's a battalion that you own,\\" says de Plater. \\"You can personalize it. You can customize it. You can choose its motto and its heraldry. You can change its composition and abilities.\\" According to a Pre-GC IGN article: \\"Each faction has roughly 150 upgrades and units have six levels of experience. These upgrades are where the seven unit types can gain great variety and specialization through three different ways- experience, equipment, and training, all of which have different effects and abilities. This allows many of the related unit types other games consider a different class have merely to be folded into one of the eight present in EndWar. For example, a rifleman may be upgraded to a sniper unit rather than having that unit type exist by itself.\\"Pre-GC First look Each individual unit can be upgraded, improving their armor or offensive capability. Upgrades must be bought from points earned in the game. The player will not control individual soldiers, but much larger platoons and companies. The soldiers will behave realistically, using stealth and military tactics. Veterans will act based on their experience in previous battles. Craters, walls, debris, and buildings can be used for cover, and units can be pinned down by heavy enemy fire. De Plater hinted at the game being streamlined with regards to units, resource management, etc. He stated that \\"every time they cut features out, it just made the game better.\\" For example, only 12 groups are allowed under control at once. Also, the resource system will be stripped down compared to other RTS games. Each unit costs the same amount of resources, which are gained by capturing strategic points on the battlefield. Reinforcements will be handled realistically meaning all new units must be transported onto the battlefield by a transport vehicle (or in the case of helicopters, will fly in from off-screen). To call in new units it costs between one and six CP (Command Points), Command Points are also used to call in airstrikes, force recon, and electronic warfare, the three kinds of off-map support. Command Points regenerate at a rate of around one point for every 30 seconds and are also gained for killing enemy units, the player gains a bonus of four Command Points for capturing an uplink. Mission supports There are also three mission supports that can be upgraded: Air strikes that can be used to damage or destroy enemy units. Electronic warfare disrupts enemy communications, disables shields, reveals hidden traps and infantry, and immobilizes enemy vehicles and helicopters. Force Recon is a support weapon that sends a regular army unit to a captured uplink to protect it, or to attack a designated hostile. It consists of up to two infantry units, two FAVs (Fast Attack Vehicle) units, and two Tank units from the regular army, depending on the level of the mission support. DEFCON 1 supports When a battle reaches DEFCON 1 two supports are unlocked for the losing player; these are the ability to Crash an Uplink and deploy a WMD. When an uplink is crashed its upgrade can no longer be used and it no longer counts towards victory; Crashing an Uplink does not damage any units on the battlefield and can only be done once. A WMD, however, destroys all units within a large blast area, whether friendly or not. WMDs recharge slowly, so they can be used again. If the losing player uses a WMD, their opponent can retaliate by using a WMD of their own. Additionally, during DEFCON 1, units used as reinforcements only cost two Command Points. Mission types There are four types of missions in the game: conquest, assault, raid and siege.http://uk.ps3.ign.com/dor/objects/902335/tom-clancys- endwar/videos/EndWar_MT_Final_Combo.html;jsessionid=139nmh6yt3hff * Conquest: These battles are the most common, as Conquest is the primary mode in EndWar. The player starts with up to four units and has access to reserves and off map support. The aim of this mission type is to maintain control over a majority of the uplinks for a five-minute period. The player can also win by controlling all of the uplinks on the map at once which grants an instant victory. When over half the uplinks are controlled, DEFCON 1 initiates and access to DEFCON 1 supports is granted. * Assault: These battles are the most straightforward. To win this battle, the player must wipe out all enemy units. * Raid: These battles are like conquest mode, but the player has to sabotage the enemy by destroying half of the key buildings on the map within ten minutes on offense or prevent them from being destroyed on defense. WMDs are not available. * Siege: These battles are exclusive to capital cities and require the player to capture or defend a critical uplink identified by being larger than all other uplinks. The attacker must secure the uplink before reinforcements arrive in ten minutes. The defender will be given eight units and must hold on to the uplink for ten minutes time, at which point a massive Force Recon team deploys. Until the timer runs out, the defenders must do without any off-map support, including reinforcements and evacuation choppers, forcing units to fight to the last man. Off-map supports, including WMDs and reinforcements, are half the CP cost. In all mission types, the player can also win by annihilating the enemy force. Voice interface Tom Clancy's EndWar offers the player a voice interface. Instead of controlling the game via mouse and keyboard, the player may optionally issue commands using a microphone. The voice interface is made possible by a speech recognition engine, supporting at least the English language. Officials at Ubisoft Shanghai said it was also possible to control the game using only voice commands; Jeff Bakalar of CNET concurred, saying the demonstration he watched ran for twenty minutes without any perceptible faults.; cited in Hearing enemy soldiers communicate gives the player a strategic advantage to counter the enemy's attack with one of their own. Ubisoft has even created a video showing parrots commanding units using their voice.http://www.gametrailers.com/player/42075.html Point of view The primary view in the game is from the perspective of one of the units under the player's command. The view can be moved a short distance from the selected unit or switched to that of another unit. Enemy units will only be detected if they are within the Line-of-Sight of a unit, which is a more realistic type of fog of war than is found in most other strategy games. In addition to the units' point of view, there is a tactical map or Sitrep view, which shows the entire map with the locations of all allied and any visible enemy units which can be used to issue commands. Sitrep can only be accessed if a Command Vehicle is deployed on the battlefield. Development=Xbox 360 beta A private beta test version was playable among Xbox Live Gold members. It included three maps and both 1v1 and 2v2 matches. The beta test began June 16, 2008 and ended July 9, 2008.Tom Clancy's EndWar private beta coming in June.

Marketing and release The special edition of Rainbow Six Vegas 2 included a video with the first live gameplay footage of this game. There have been online advertisements, as well as an EndWar website at Endwargame.com. Endwar's release date was pushed back three times originally planned to be released in 2007, but was pushed back to March 2008 and then to November 4, 2008.http://www.ign.com/games/tom-clancys-endwar/xbox-360-902336 Trailer The first EndWar trailer released in 2007, displays an overhead map of Western Europe with only a large part of Spain and half of France under Joint Strike Force control, while the Russian Federation Spetsnaz has engrossed the rest of the continent. The camera then zooms to an ongoing battle in Paris, where a local Joint Strike Force commander, Major General Smith, directs the action from a mobile headquarters vehicle by using an interactive holographic map display. Outside, U.S. soldiers armed with assault rifles similar to the XM8, along with advanced IFVs, DPVs, and M5A2 Schwarzkopf tanks, attack Russian forces holding out at the Place de la Concorde and the Louvre museum. Eventually, the US troops call in air support in the form of AH-80 Blackfoot attack helicopters and V-25 transports, forcing the Russians to retreat. However, the assault is short-lived, as in addition to a mechanized counterattack, the Russian forces launch multitudinous Tu-3 UCAVs that shoot down the helicopters right on top of the soldiers and nearly wiping out the entire Joint Strike Force. Realizing this problematic situation in which the Spetsnaz are on the upper hand, General Smith issues voice attack commands to a Kinetic Strike satellite in orbit over Europe. Russian soldiers suppress him, as he emerges from his command vehicle. Just before the Spetsnaz take him in as a prisoner of war, the general says, \\"Now.\\" The satellite fires at least three kinetic rods down on his position, obliterating himself and the Russian Spetsnaz along with large portions of Paris. Smith's death would be mentioned in passing in the EndWar novel. The music used in this trailer was composed by Michael McCann and can be found at his website. The music of a different trailer is The End of the World by Skeeter Davis. Novelization Endwar was published as a novel, on February 4, 2008 in paperback form. The back cover says \\"Based on Ubisoft's bestselling game, Tom Clancy's EndWar\\", despite the game not yet having been released at that time. The sequel Tom Clancy's EndWar: The Hunted was released on February 1, 2011 by Berkley Books. A second sequel Tom Clancy's EndWar: The Missing was released in 2013. The first two books are written by Grant Blackwood under the pseudonym David Michaels. The third book is written by Peter Telep. Downloadable content Since release, Endwar has received the \\"Escalation\\" downloadable pack on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace which contains three new unit upgrades (one per faction) and four new maps playable in skirmish mode, as well as additional achievements/trophies. Another set of upgrades were released, entitled the \\"Faction Elite pack\\" which included six new unit upgrades (two per faction) and three new battalions (one per faction). Also, announced on March 13, two new missions on two new maps will be available for free. Their assault on Russia's Cosmodrome and conquest on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Richton, Mississippi, U.S. Reception EndWar received mixed to positive reviews. The Guardian gave the game a 4/5 It was praised for its \\"Highly addictive solo play...the game comes into its own with the massively multiplayer online Theatre of War.\\" while being docked somewhat for \\"occasional voice recognition blip\\". The website www.gametrailers.com gave EndWar a 9/10 saying that it was \\"Console strategy done right.\\" IGN rated EndWar as an 8 out of 10 taking marks away for the \\"Uninspired single player campaign\\" but still saw it as a more than solid RTS. Game Spot's Kevin VanOrd rated the PS3 version of EndWar as a 7.5 out of 10 praising its \\"Innovative voice command mechanic\\" and stating \\"Persistent online campaign makes matches feel meaningful\\" but berated it for its lack of story and \\"simple rock-paper- scissors skirmishes\\". 1Up and Electronic Gaming Monthly both gave the game a C. Cancelled sequel A sequel to the game was confirmed to be in the early stages of development by Ubisoft's creative director Michael De Plater in an interview with VideoGamer.com.Ubisoft Shanghai working on EndWar Sequel A small team from Ubisoft Shanghai is in charge of the development, he said, and \\"is concentrating on two areas of improvement - single-player story and depth.\\" He could not, however, place a date as to when more information on the sequel would be released. On February 8, 2010, it was announced that the development of the sequel was canceled, due to the game's commercial failure.

History Lone Oak was named for the large Live Oak Tree which once occupied the center of the town. In the early 1970s this tree died and was removed. The community now has a feed store, restaurants, Lone Oak Grocery, and several convenience stores. G. M. Smith moved his family from San Antonio out on the Old La Vernia Hwy., what is now Lone Oak, in the mid 1920s. Mr. Smith rented a building for $10 a month and made living quarters in the back and opened a store in the front. His business grew large enough that he later built a store and house on the corner while renting a house across Hwy 87. The store was named G M SMITH but they began to call the area Lone Oak because of the large tree. Mr. Smith was also a deputy sheriff and was credited for stopping two highway workers from crossing the Mexico Border with Spanish Gold that they had discovered while working on Highway 87. The family continued living there until the early 1940s. Their two children went to Adken and Sawyer schools but graduate from Brackenridge High School which was 18 miles away. In the mid 1940s Mr. Smith and his wife bought Barbee Hatchery in Yorktown, Texas and ran a successful poultry business until the last 1970's. Film Appearances Several scenes of the 1974 Feature film The Sugarland Express directed by Steven Spielberg were filmed in Lone Oak. The scene where they stop at an old country store was filmed at the Lone Oak Grocery store. The scene where the news van runs off the road into the water was filmed along Loop 1604 a few miles south of Lone Oak. The character played by actress Goldie Hawn was said in the movie to come from the nearby town of Sayers, Texas. The town named \\"Rodrigo\\" in the movie is actually nearby Floresville, Texas.

He has published extensively on topics in graph theory, combinatorics, and combinatorial optimization. Biography Chvátal was born in Prague in 1946 and educated in mathematics at Charles University in Prague, where he studied under the supervision of Zdeněk Hedrlín. He fled Czechoslovakia in 1968, three days after the Soviet invasion, and completed his Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Waterloo, under the supervision of Crispin St. J. A. Nash-Williams, in the fall of 1970.The Mathematics Genealogy Project – Václav Chvátal Subsequently, he took positions at McGill University (1971 and 1978-1986), Stanford University (1972 and 1974-1977), the Université de Montréal (1972-1974 and 1977-1978), and Rutgers University (1986-2004) before returning to Montreal for the Canada Research Chair in Combinatorial Optimization Vasek Chvatal awarded Canada Research Chair, Concordia's Thursday Report, Oct. 23, 2003.Vasek Chvátal is ‘the travelling professor’, Concordia's Thursday Report, Feb. 10, 2005. at Concordia (2004-2011) and the Canada Research Chair in Discrete Mathematics (2011-2014) till his retirement. Research The Chvátal graph Chvátal first learned of graph theory in 1964, on finding a book by Claude Berge in a Pilsen bookstore , and much of his research involves graph theory: *His first mathematical publication, at the age of 19, concerned directed graphs that cannot be mapped to themselves by any nontrivial graph homomorphism . *Another graph-theoretic result of Chvátal was the 1970 construction of the smallest possible triangle-free graph that is both 4-chromatic and 4-regular, now known as the Chvátal graph. *A 1972 paper , relating Hamiltonian cycles to connectivity and maximum independent set size of a graph, earned Chvátal his Erdős number of 1. Specifically, if there exists an s such that a given graph is s-vertex-connected and has no (s + 1)-vertex independent set, the graph must be Hamiltonian. Avis et al. tell the story of Chvátal and Erdős working out this result over the course of a long road trip, and later thanking Louise Guy \\"for her steady driving.\\" *In a 1973 paper,, Chvátal introduced the concept of graph toughness, a measure of graph connectivity that is closely connected to the existence of Hamiltonian cycles. A graph is t-tough if, for every k greater than 1, the removal of fewer than tk vertices leaves fewer than k connected components in the remaining subgraph. For instance, in a graph with a Hamiltonian cycle, the removal of any nonempty set of vertices partitions the cycle into at most as many pieces as the number of removed vertices, so Hamiltonian graphs are 1-tough. Chvátal conjectured that 3/2-tough graphs, and later that 2-tough graphs, are always Hamiltonian; despite later researchers finding counterexamples to these conjectures, it still remains open whether some constant bound on the graph toughness is enough to guarantee Hamiltonicity. Some of Chvátal's work concerns families of sets, or equivalently hypergraphs, a subject already occurring in his Ph.D. thesis, where he also studied Ramsey theory. *In a 1972 conjecture that Erdős called \\"surprising\\" and \\"beautiful\\",Mathematical Reviews MR0369170 and that remains open (with a $10 prize offered by Chvátal for its solution) : Problem 25 he suggested that, in any family of sets closed under the operation of taking subsets, the largest pairwise-intersecting subfamily may always be found by choosing an element of one of the sets and keeping all sets containing that element. *In 1979,\\"A greedy heuristic for the set- covering problem\\", Mathematics of Operations Research, 1979 he studied a weighted version of the set cover problem, and proved that a greedy algorithm provides good approximations to the optimal solution, generalizing previous unweighted results by David S. Johnson (J. Comp. Sys. Sci. 1974) and László Lovász (Discrete Math. 1975). Chvátal first became interested in linear programming through the influence of Jack Edmonds while Chvátal was a student at Waterloo. He quickly recognized the importance of cutting planes for attacking combinatorial optimization problems such as computing maximum independent sets and, in particular, introduced the notion of a cutting-plane proof.,,,. At Stanford in the 1970s, he began writing his popular textbook, Linear Programming, which was published in 1983. Cutting planes lie at the heart of the branch and cut method used by efficient solvers for the traveling salesman problem. Between 1988 and 2005, the team of David L. Applegate, Robert E. Bixby, Vašek Chvátal, and William J. Cook developed one such solver, Concorde.Math Problem, Long Baffling, Slowly Yields.

Architecture Frontal Entrance to Chandragupta Basadi The basadi originally consisted of three cells standing in a line and opening into a narrow passage. The basadi is southfacing and the cells on either side have small towers over them resembling the chole type. Subsequently, an ornamental doorway has been added in front with perforated stone screens at the sides. The screens are pierced with square openings are carved with minute sculptures, interpreted, in the light of Jaina tradition, as the scenes from the lives of the Srutakevali, Bhadrabahu and Chandragupta Maurya. Some irregularity is observed in the alternate rows of the eastern screens owing to some misplacement. By replacing the topmost stone at the bottom and the bottom one at the top the rows regularity correspond with those of the western screen. The middle cell of this temple has the figure of Parshvanatha, the one to the right the figure of Padmavathi and the one to the left the figure of Kushmandini, all in a seated posture. In the verandah there are standing figures of Dharanendra yaksha at the right end and Sarvahna yaksha at the left. The temple opens into the front hall which also forms the entrance to the Kattale basadi. In this hall stands a figure of Kshetrapala opposite to the middle cell of the Chandragupta basadi. The outer walls are decorated with pilasters, friezes, niches, the heads and trunks of lions mostly in pairs facing each other. Tradition says that this temple was caused to be erected by the Maurya emperor Chandragupta. The label dasoja occurring on one of the screens is undoubtedly the name of the sculptor who made the screens and the doorway. He is very probably identical with the sculptor who carved some of the fine bracket images of the Chennakesava temple at Belur and therefore the period of the screens and the doorway would be about the middle of the 12th century A.D. The other parts of the building are some of the oldest on the hill, probably going back to the ninth or tenth century A.D.

Ginger Rogers won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Kitty Foyle, and the dress she wore in the film became a new dress style, known as a Kitty Foyle dress. Plot Ginger Rogers as Kitty Foyle Kitty Foyle (Ginger Rogers), a saleswoman in a New York boutique working for Delphine Detaille (Odette Myrtil), faces a life-changing decision: Marry doctor Mark Eisen (James Craig) or run away to South America with the man she has loved for many years, the already-married Wyn Strafford (Dennis Morgan). As she wrestles with her decision, the film flashes back to her youth in Philadelphia. As a teenager, Kitty gawks at the city's elite \\"Main Liners\\" in a parade that precedes their annual Assembly Ball. Her father (Ernest Cossart) warns against getting carried away with her fantasies. Ironically, Kitty meets the embodiment of her dreams in an acquaintance of his: Wynnewood Strafford VI. Wyn offers her a secretarial job at his fledgling magazine. The two fall deeply in love, but when the magazine folds, he does not have the will to defy his social class's strictures by proposing to a woman so far below him socially. With the death of her father and no prospect of marriage with Wyn, Kitty goes to work in New York for Delphine. One day, she presses the burglar alarm button by mistake at Delphine's fashion store. She pretends to faint to cover her blunder and is attended to by Mark (the doctor). Mark, aware she is faking it, playfully blackmails her into a first date. Wyn finally breaks down and finds Kitty in New York. The two wed, but agree that the only way their marriage can work is if they do not live in Philadelphia. When he introduces her to his family, she gets a chilly reception. She also learns that Wyn would be disinherited and left penniless if he does not remain in Philadelphia and work in the family banking business. She realizes, though Wyn is willing to try, he is not strong enough to deal with poverty. She walks out, and they are divorced. Kitty returns to New York, where she learns that she is pregnant. When Wyn arranges to meet her, her hopes for a reconciliation are raised, only to be dashed when she sees a newspaper announcement of Wyn's engagement to someone of his own social standing. She leaves without seeing him and receives a further blow when the baby dies at birth. Several years later, Kitty reluctantly agrees to open a Philadelphia branch store for her friend Delphine. By chance, she waits on Wyn's wife and meets their son. She takes the opportunity to entrust the secret return of a family heirloom ring to the boy. The film returns to the beginning. She decides to marry Mark. CastProduction Katharine Hepburn, who starred opposite Rogers (but was frequently at odds with her) in Stage Door, was offered the title role, but turned it down. The film was adapted by Dalton Trumbo and Donald Ogden Stewart from the 1939 novel Kitty Foyle by Christopher Morley. It was directed by Sam Wood. Reception Kitty Foyle was RKO's top film for 1940, earning a profit of $869,000. Ginger Rogers in Kitty Foyle trailer Reviews from critics were generally positive. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times expressed disappointment that the story had been softened from the novel due to Production Code restrictions, but wrote of the protagonist that \\"Ginger Rogers plays her with as much forthright and appealing integrity as one can possibly expect.\\" Variety wrote \\"Despite its episodic, and at times, vaguely defined motivation, picture on whole is a poignant and dramatic portraiture of a typical Cinderella girl's love story. Several good comedy sequences interline the footage, deftly written and directed. Ginger Rogers provides strong dramatic portrayal in the title role.\\" Film Daily called it \\"one of the most human pictures that has been produced in Hollywood in many, many moons ... a triumph for Ginger Rogers.\\" Harrison's Reports wrote \\"Very good!...The story is simple but realistic; it has deep human appeal, a stirring romance, and delightful comedy bits; moreover, the performances are excellent.\\" \\"I am inclined to think that it's Miss Ginger alone who makes 'Kitty Foyle' a better-than-average film and Kitty herself a proper model for those hundreds of thousands of young things who will now be adding a touch of white to their neckline,\\" John Mosher wrote in The New Yorker. \\"Without Miss Ginger, it would be very easy to remember how often many of the scenes shown in this film have been seen before on the screen.\\" Kitty Foyle was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, and the Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay. Ginger Rogers won for Best Actress. It was also nominated for Best Director (Sam Wood), Best Sound (John Aalberg). In 1951, in a series of articles examining film adaptation, Lester Asheim notes that some films \\"reproduce the costume, housing, and appearance of the novel's prototypes without softening or heightening,\\" but that Kitty Foyle shows the more typical \\"glamorizing\\" process of film adaptation: > Kitty Foyle is typical, in every aspect of the adaptation, of the daydream > character of film characterization. The glamorizing process carries through > from the casting of Ginger Rogers and the Hollywood wardrobe provided her, > to such added incidents as Wyn renting an entire nightclub for a > night...While the film retains a scene or two of Kitty's crowded apartment > shared with two other girls, such scenes are played for comedy and no > attempt is made to convey the day-to-day monotony and routine of the working > girl. Rogers' dress became a popular style, taking the name of the film. Adaptations On December 9, 1940, Life magazine republished a pictorial adaptation that the film's designers had used as models when creating the movie. The cover featured Ginger Rogers as the Kitty Foyle character. Kitty Foyle was adapted as a radio play on the May 5, 1941, episode of Lux Radio Theatre with Ginger Rogers reprising her role. Rogers also starred in the April 6, 1946, adaptation heard on Academy Award Theater. On March 3, 1947, it was produced for The Screen Guild Theater starring Olivia de Havilland. The story also was adapted into a TV soap opera starring Kathleen Murray as Kitty Foyle.

WQLK broadcasts at an effective radiated power of 50,000 Watts with its studios, offices, and tower located east of US 35 on Tingler Road just north of Richmond. Programming WQLK plays country music, mainly from the 1990s and today. It is also broadcasts Indiana University Men's basketball The station used to broadcast Richmond High School football and boys basketball broadcasts until 2000. Those broadcasts have since moved to sister station, 1017 The Point. WHON AM-FM History WQLK is Richmond's oldest FM radio signal. The station signed on as WGLM, featuring a Jazz format. This format continued until 1970 when the station adopted a country music format. Jazz remained a fixture on the station, however. WQLK continued to broadcast a Sunday morning jazz program until 1992 when the station became \\"Kicks 96\\". By 1974, the station changed its call sign to WQLK and adopted an Easy listening format and briefly returned to country before flip-flopping formats with its AM sister station, WHON in 1979 to become Top 40 as K-96. Throughout the early- and mid-1980s, WQLK saw quite a bit of success as a Top 40. What made K-96 stand out from stations in nearby Dayton, Indianapolis, and Cincinnati was that it leaned more to toward the Rock side of the genre. This \\"Rock 40\\" format gave artists such as The Police, Duran Duran, Def Leppard, for example, more exposure than heard on a conventional Top 40. K-96 did play some Rhythmic music, but mainly those from bands that were considered to be new wave music. By today's standards, \\"Rock 40\\" would be termed as a Modern Rock format. By the end of the 1980s, WQLK became a classic hits station featuring mainly 1970s rock. The format quickly morphed into classic rock by 1990 and then album oriented rock by the early 1990s. The station retained the \\"K-96\\" moniker and the koala mascot throughout these format tweaks. In the spring of 1992, and with rumors of a format change in the air, their playlist began to shift slightly incorporating songs by Mary Chapin Carpenter (Passionate Kisses), Restless Heart (When She Cries) and even country crooner Vince Gill (I Still Believe In You) into their playlists right alongside format regulars Led Zeppelin, Boston and John Mellencamp. Popular air personalities from this time period include The Captain, Jim Rhodes, The Buddha and Mike Fox. WQLK's HD Radio Channels on a SPARC Radio with PSD. Finally in July 1992, the \\"K-96\\" era of the station came to an end. At 5pm on the Friday before the format change, the radio station began playing the song \\"Kicks\\" by Paul Revere & the Raiders continuously all weekend. The following Monday at 5am, morning show hosts J.R. & The Buddha premiered the radio station's new contemporary Country format as, \\"Kicks 96.\\" J.R. & The Buddha remained as the radio station's morning show until J.R. was replaced by Buzz Cannon in 1995. At this time Buzz also took over as the station's Program Director. The Buzz & Buddha morning show remained an integral part of the station's success until Buzz's departure in 1999. Upon Buzz's departure from the station, Buddha took over as Program Director and evening air personality Angie Fox was promoted to mornings. Buddha was replaced as Program Director in 2001 by afternoon air-personality Steve Baker who remained the station's P.D. until October 31, 2008. Baker was replaced by Phil O'Reilly on November 1, 2008. The radio station's General Manager Dave Strycker has remained the station's G.M. since 1978. Angie & The Buddha have won numerous awards from The Indiana Broadcasters Association as have Steve Baker, News Director Jeff Lane and Production Director Joe Winters.

Ralstonia pickettii is a Betaproteobacteria species found in moist environments such as soils, rivers, and lakes. It has also been identified in biofilms in plastic water pipes. It is an oligotrophic organism, making it capable of surviving in areas with a very low concentration of nutrients. Several strains have shown an ability to survive in environments highly contaminated with metals. The ability to persist in these harsh conditions makes R. pickettii a candidate for bioremediation. Ralstonia pickettii and R. insidiosa are emerging pathogens in hospital settings. R. pickettii pathology does not follow an easy definition; although no fully healthy human has ever become ill from it, the bacterium has seriously affected humans with poor health. Several hospitals have reported outbreaks—in particular, patients with cystic fibrosis and Crohn's disease have been shown to be infected with R. picketti. Of the 55 reported cases of such infection, the majority are due to contaminated solutions such as water, saline, and sterile drugs. These solutions are usually contaminated when the product is manufactured, because R. pickettii has the ability to pass through 0.45 and 0.2 µm filters that are used to sterilize medicinal products. The majority of R. pickettii and R. insidiosa isolates showed susceptibility to most of the antibiotics tested. The most effective were found to be the quinolones and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim.

The song was inspired by and written for Miguel Valdez, a percussionist who collaborated with the band in 1992 and died due to hepatitis in 1993. Dave Matthews co-wrote the song with LeRoi Moore, Carter Beauford and Haines Fullerton, another collaborator, who later took his own life in September 1996. On the album, the song is \\"hidden\\" as track number 34, with 22 blank tracks between it and the previous track, \\"Pay for What You Get.\\" History \\"#34\\" was named as it was the thirty- fourth song recorded by the band, similar to the band's later songs \\"#36,\\" \\"#40,\\" and \\"#41.\\" It is in 27/8 time signature or 3 cycles of 9/8, and changes to 6/8 and 11/8 during the chorus. The song debuted live in February 1993 and was played a total of nine times at various shows up until March of that year. Each performance lasted around eight-and-a-half minutes and featured lyrics sung by Dave Matthews. The lyrics of the song were unstructured and varied slightly throughout its nine live performances. The theme of the song's lyrics were initially about love; however, they were later based around themes of death. When the band recorded the song for Under the Table and Dreaming in September 1994, lyrics were recorded, but were removed for the album. After the live performances in 1993 and the studio recording in 1994, \\"#34\\" had not been played live by the band, except for a small tease at the beginning of a show in 2002. At the beginning of the band's summer tour in June 2005, the song was once teased again at two different shows, and then in July the song was almost completely played, but it was still much shorter than length of entire the song. Finally, on July 9, 2005, \\"#34\\" was fully played again live for the first time in over 12 years; however, it was played instrumentally, similar to its version on the album. The previous live performance of the song took place exactly 1442 shows prior, totaling a 4491-day period since the last performance, making it the band's all-time longest return of a live song performance. \\"#34\\" returned for a total 11 performances that year in its instrumental form and can be found on the live album on Weekend on the Rocks, which is from the band's four-night stand at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. On October 2, during the band's final show for the 2007 Summer Tour at the Hollywood Bowl, \\"#34\\" returned for Dave's wife's 34th birthday. The return also marked the first time since 1993 that #34 had lyrics. After LeRoi Moore died in August 2008, the song was used as the backing track to a photo and video montage of the musician that was played during the encore break of performances by the band at the last two venues of the 2008 summer tour. After numerous teases of the song during the 2013 Summer Tour (notably on the 5th anniversary of Moore's last show with the band), the band brought back the song in full, with lyrics, playing it for the first time since October 2, 2007. The song was played on September 7, 2018, Leroi Moore’s birthday, at Harvey’s Lake Tahoe Outdoor Arena in Stateline, NV.

The Council of Lithuania declared Lithuania's independence on February 16, 1918, but the Council was unable to form a government, police, or other state institutions due to the continued presence of German troops. The Germans presented various proposals to incorporate Lithuania into the German Empire, particularly Prussia. The Lithuanians resisted this idea and hoped to preserve their independence by creating a separate constitutional monarchy. On June 4, 1918, they voted to offer the Lithuanian throne to the German noble Wilhelm, 2nd Duke of Urach. Duke Wilhelm accepted the offer in July 1918 and took the name Mindaugas II. However, he never visited Lithuania. His election stirred up controversy, divided the Council and did not achieve the desired results. As Germany was losing the war and was engulfed in the German Revolution, Lithuania suspended its decision to invite Duke William on November 2, 1918, thereby ending his reign. Background After the last Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Lithuania was annexed by the Russian Empire. In 1915, during World War I, Germany occupied western parts of the Russian Empire, including Lithuania. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Germany conceived the geopolitical strategy of Mitteleuropa, a regional network of puppet states that would serve as a buffer zone.Sužiedėlis (1970–1978), p. 581. The Germans allowed the organisation of the Vilnius Conference, hoping that it would proclaim that the Lithuanian nation wanted to detach itself from Russia and establish a \\"closer relationship\\" with Germany.Eidintas (1999), p. 26. In September 1917, the Conference elected a twenty-member Council of Lithuania and empowered it to negotiate Lithuanian independence with the Germans. The Germans were preparing for the upcoming negotiations for the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and sought a declaration from the Lithuanians that they wanted a \\"firm and permanent alliance\\" with Germany.Eidintas (1999), p. 29. Such a declaration was adopted by the Council of Lithuania on December 11, 1917. However, these concessions divided the Council and still did not earn recognition from Germany. Therefore, the Council adopted the Act of Independence of Lithuania on February 16, 1918. The Act omitted any mention of alliance with Germany and declared the \\"termination of all state ties which formerly bound this State to other nations.\\"Eidintas (1999), p. 30. On March 3, 1918, Germany and Bolshevik Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which declared that the Baltic nations were in the German interest zone and that Russia renounced any claims to them. On March 23, Germany formally recognized independent Lithuania on the basis of the December 11 declaration.Senn (1975), p. 33. However, the country was still occupied by German troops, the Council still did not have any actual power and it was treated just as an advisory board by the Germans.Tuska (1995), p. 32. Election=Candidates Duke Wilhelm of Urach became Mindaugas II, named after the former Lithuanian king Mindaugas. The crown of Lithuania was initially offered to Wilhelm II, German Emperor and King of Prussia, by the military command of Ober Ost.Senn (1975), p. 35–36. This would have created a personal union between Lithuania and Prussia. An alternative proposal called for the election of Wilhelm's youngest son, Prince Joachim.Senn (1975), p. 36. Such plans for expansion of already dominant Protestant Prussia were opposed by the Catholic kingdoms of Saxony and Bavaria. Saxony promoted Prince Friedrich Christian, second son of King Frederick Augustus III. This proposal was a reminder of historical ties between Saxony and Lithuania: the House of Wettin had produced two rulers for the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth between 1697 and 1763. A number of other candidates were also considered. Such plans were viewed by the Lithuanians as a threat to their independence. The threat became more pressing after a meeting of German officials on May 19, where conventions governing the \\"firm and permanent alliance\\" were discussed leaving very little autonomy for the Lithuanians.Čepėnas (1986), p. 215–217. An idea was advanced to create a constitutional monarchy and invite a candidate who would fight to preserve Lithuanian independence. The Presidium of the Council of Lithuania voted confidentially on June 4, 1918, to establish a hereditary monarchy and to invite Duke Wilhelm of Urach. Duke William was suggested by Matthias Erzberger, who had worked with Lithuanians in Switzerland. His candidacy had been discussed at least since March 1918. Duke William seemed to be a perfect candidate as he was a Catholic, was not in line of succession to the Kingdom of Württemberg due to his grandfather's morganatic marriage, was not closely related to the House of Hohenzollern, and had no ties to Poland. Due to obstacles posed by the German military, the Lithuanian delegation to see Duke William in Freiburg im Breisgau was delayed until July 1. Duke William and his oldest son (as heir apparent) accepted the offer without conditions.Maksimaitis (2005), p. 49. On July 11, the Council of Lithuania voted (13 for, 5 against, and 2 abstentions) to officially establish the monarchy.Skirius (2002) On August 12, the Council sent a formal invitation to Duke William to become King Mindaugas II of Lithuania. Conditions Duke William was presented with a twelve-point proposal which resembled medieval pacta conventa.Janužytė (2007), p. 19. The monarch had the executive power to appoint ministers, sign legislation into law, and initiate legislation in the parliament. The ministers were to be selected from among the Lithuanians and were to ultimately report to the parliament.Maksimaitis (2005), pp. 52–53. The King was to abide by the Constitution, protect the independence and territorial integrity of Lithuania, and preserve religious tolerance. Without parliamentary approval, he could not become ruler of another state. The Lithuanian language was to be used as the official state and court language, with a special provision to limit and eventually exclude all foreigners from the royal court.Maksimaitis (2005), p. 53. The monarch and his family were obligated to reside in Lithuania, spending no more than 2 months a year abroad. His children were to be educated and raised in Lithuania. In essence, the Lithuanians imposed \\"elective ethnicity.\\"Liulevicius (2000), p. 210. There were reports that Duke William began learning the Lithuanian language and reading about Lithuanian history and customs, but he never visited Lithuania.Page (1959), p. 94. Some authors called these conditions a constitution, but that is not accurate. Lithuanian law scholar Michał Pius Römer has called it an \\"embryo of a constitution\\"; these conditions were a very basic and temporary framework that would have developed into a constitution, had not the monarchy been abolished.Maksimaitis (2005), p. 54. A project for a full constitution was later found in German archives, but it was never discussed by the Council of Lithuania and remained just a draft.Maksimaitis (2005), pp. 56, 60. After the election The proposal for monarchy was controversial and created a rift between right-wing and left- wing members of the Council of Lithuania. The proposal was most strongly supported by Antanas Smetona, Jurgis Šaulys, and Catholic priests.Tuska (1995), p. 49. When the monarchy was approved, four members of the council resigned in protest: Steponas Kairys, Jonas Vileišis, Mykolas Biržiška, Stanisław Narutowicz (Stanislovas Narutavičius). Petras Klimas also voted against, but did not resign. At the same time the Council co-opted six new members: Martynas Yčas, Augustinas Voldemaras, Juozas Purickis, Eliziejus Draugelis, Jurgis Alekna and Stasys Šilingas. The debate over a constitutional monarchy vs. democratic republic was not a new one. Earlier, in December 1917, the Council had voted 15-to-5 that a monarchy would suit Lithuania better.Maksimaitis (2005), pp. 45–46. The proponents argued that the Lithuanians were not politically mature for a republic and that the Germans would more readily support a monarchy. The opponents maintained that the Council had no legal right to determine such fundamental matters as these had been delegated to the future Constituent Assembly of Lithuania by the Vilnius Conference.Eidintas (1999), p. 31. The Germans did not approve of the new king. They claimed that their recognition of independent Lithuania was based on the Act of December 11, which provided for an alliance with Germany and therefore Lithuania did not have the right to unilaterally elect a new monarch.Senn (1975), p. 37. They also protested that the Council of Lithuania had changed its name to the State Council of Lithuania just before the approval of Mindaugas II. The Council stopped using its new name in communications with the Germans but stood by its new king. The Lithuanian press was censored and not allowed to publish any news about the new king, while the German press unanimously criticized the decision.Čepėnas (1986), pp. 220–221. When Lietuvos aidas, the newspaper of the Council, refused to print an article denouncing the new king, the newspaper was shut down for a month. German–Lithuanian relations remained tense until October 1918. The election also further damaged the reputation of the Council, already portrayed as a German puppet, among the Entente powers and the Lithuanian diaspora.Senn (1975), p. 38. Lithuanians in the west thought that Lithuania should place its hopes of independence with the Entente and not Germany. This rift further fractured and weakened the Lithuanian positions.Senn (1975), pp. 38–39. Republic As Germany was losing the war, the Lithuanians received more freedom of action. On October 20, 1918, Chancellor of Germany Prince Maximilian of Baden repeated recognition of independent Lithuania, promised to convert the German military administration into a civilian government, and to allow the Lithuanians to take over once they had sufficient capabilities.Senn (1975), pp. 39–40. After receiving this news, the Council of Lithuania convened on October 28 to discuss a provisional constitution and formation of the government. As no projects or drafts had been prepared beforehand, these decisions needed to be made by the Council during its session and this process took several days.Maksimaitis (2005), p. 62. The changed political situation also dictated the Council's need to rescind its decision to elect Mindaugas II. Lithuania, hoping to receive recognition from the Entente, could not have the Entente's enemy as its king.Maksimaitis (2005), p. 64. Duke William indicated that he was willing to abandon the throne. Therefore, on November 2, the Council suspended its invitation to Duke William leaving the final decision to the future Constituent Assembly of Lithuania. Later the same day the Council adopted the first provisional constitution, which did not declare either monarchy or republic. The constitution simply organized the government on a provisional basis until the Constituent Assembly made a final decision.Paleckis (2006) Further constitutions did not reconsider a monarchy. Independent Lithuania operated for just one month. On December 16, 1918, Vincas Mickevičius-Kapsukas became the leader of the puppet state known as Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic.

In 2001, Hanover Shoe Farms set the all- time breeder earnings record regardless of breed with $21,372,418 in annual progeny earnings.United States Trotting Association The farm encompasses in and around Hanover, Pennsylvania, USA. It is home to 9 stallions, 336 yearlings and over 500 broodmares. The yearling farm is located near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania and a satellite stallion station is located in Lambertville, New Jersey with two more stallions. Hanover Shoe Farm has produced world champion racehorses and its stallions have sired a multitude of winners. History Founded in the early 1900s as Hanover Shoe Stables by Harper D. Sheppard and Clinton N. Myers, owners of the Hanover Shoe Company, a manufacturer and retailer of leather shoes, the racing stable was started as a venture for the two businessmen. Hanover Shoe Stables fell under the management of Lawrence Sheppard, Sheppard's son, in 1922 and in 1926, he purchased a 69 horse dispersal from the estate of A.B. Coxe for $150,000. According to The Kentucky Harness Horse, written by Standardbred historian Ken McCarr, it was \\"the start of one of the largest and most prominent harness horse nurseries in the world\\".The Kentucky Harness Horse by Ken McCarr (former editor of The Horseman & Fairworld magazine and registrar at The USTA from 1948-1971)Page 85. In 1926, the farm began to sell small consignments of yearlings at public auction. In 1928, Hanover's Bertha (t,3,T1:59,1/2m, $71,779), a daughter of Peter Volo out of Miss Bertha Dillion who was purchased from the Coxe estate, was retained by the farm and trained by Tom Berry. She set a two-year-old trotting record of 2:02 in 1929, and it wasn't until 1934 that her record was equaled by Lawrence Hanover, her full brother.Drivers Up by Dwight Akers Page 323. As a three-year-old, Hanover's Bertha was undefeated and gave the stable its first Hambletonian victory. She trotted the first 2:00 mile in an official race while winning the 1930 Kentucky Futurity.Quest For Excellence by Dean Hoffmann (executive editor of Hoofbeats magazine)Page 27. Lawrence Sheppard was president of the United States Trotting Association from 1950–1958 and was its honorary life president. He was the first chairman of the Pennsylvania Racing Commission, an amateur driver and founded the Hall of Fame of the Trotter located in Goshen, New York. As stated by Philip A. Pines, author of The Complete Book of Harness Racing, Sheppard \\"played major roles throughout the sport's modern history\\".The Complete Book Of Harness Racing by Philp A Pines (Director of The Hall 0f Fame of The Trotter)Pages 298 and 299. In 1964, John Simpson took over the management of the farm as Sheppard's health began to decline. Upon Sheppard's death, his widow, Charlotte Sheppard, became Hanover's chairman of the board and the farm continued under the leadership of Simpson & Paul Spears. Simpson continued to acquire the top-quality stallions and broodmares. In 1972 they won the Trotting Triple Crown Champion and Trotter of the Year with Super Bowl (t,2,1:56.2m, $601,350) and the 1971-1972 Horse of the Year and World Champion pacer with Albatross (p,4,1:54.3f, $1,201,470). Their early crops were a success on the racetrack and launched their sires to the top of every breed category. At the Harrisburg sale in 1977, Super Bowl's offspring averaged $32,673 and Albatross' averaged $41,767. In 1977, Warm Breeze, the record holder of history's fastest race mile (p,1:53.1), and trotter Songflori (who had time trialed in t,1:55.1) were added to Hanover's stallion ranks. Present day Under the reins of Paul Spears, Jim Simpson (John F. Simpson's son) & Russell Williams (Lawrence Sheppard's grandson), Hanover Shoe Farms still raises stallions. In 2001, Hanover's veteran pacing stallions, No Nukes and Big Towner, ranked first and second on the all-time earnings list among active pacing sires, with career progeny earnings over $109 million and $105 million respectively. Additions to Hanover's mare include the 2005 Kentucky Filly Futurity and World Trotting Derby winner, Her Culese (t,3,1:53.3m, $354,658), the 2004 Buckette and Review Stake winner, Bramasole (t,4,1:53.1, $347,753), the 1998 Jugette, Matron, NJSS 3Year Old Filly Championship winner, Armbro Romance (p,3,1:49.4m, $794,375), and 2001 Harness Horse of the Year, Bunny Lake (p,1:49m, $2,843,476) .

Armeekorps) was a corps-level command of the German Army on the Western Front during World War II. It was created on 24 September 1942, in Military Region (Wehrkreis) VIII as the LXIV Reserve Corps with the mission of supervising reserve divisions assigned to OB West, the German high command in the west. Activated on 5 August 1944 and renamed the LXIV Corps.Tessin LXIV Corps was headquartered in the vicinity of Dijon from October 1942 until April 1944. During May and June 1944, the LXIV Corps Headquarters was located in northern France. In July 1944, the corps was sent to southwestern France near the Gironde Estuary. The following month, the LXIV corps had to retreat under difficult conditions to avoid being cut off by Allied units that had broken out of Normandy and other Allied forces that had invaded southern France. By September 1944, LXIV Corps had established a line of defense in the Vosges Mountains as part of the German Nineteenth Army. The corps, however, was in a weak state, with its two assigned divisions only able to muster some 4,250 effectives.These were the 189. and 716. Infanterie divisions.Clarke and Smith, p. 198 By late November 1944, Allied advances had forced the Nineteenth Army into an area around Colmar, nicknamed the Colmar Pocket. An offensive by French First Army and U.S. XXI Corps troops during January and February 1945 collapsed the Colmar Pocket, forcing the LXIV Corps to retreat across the Rhine River into Baden. In April 1945, with the Allies across the Rhine as well, French forces thrust forward on April 18 and seized Tübingen, splitting the LXIV Corps into two parts. Attempts by the corps to reunite its elements failed in the face of Allied strength, and the commander of the corps at that time, General der Artillerie Max Grimmeiss,Max Grimmeiss, 1893–1972, served in various staff assignments and commanded Wehrkreis XI for two months prior to assuming command of the LXIV.

There he finds shelter and food (he says \\"there was nothing that was not there\\").Lichtheim, Miriam Ancient Egyptian Literature University of California Press 1975 p212 While making a burnt offering to the gods, he hears thunder and feels the earth shake and sees a giant serpent approach him.

The sailor repeats his story, now saying that he was on a mission for the king. The serpent tells him not to fear and that god has let him live and brought him to the island, and that after four months on the island he will be rescued by sailors he knows and will return home.

Laughing at him, the serpent says that the sailor is not rich, but that he (the serpent) is Lord of Punt and that the island is rich in incense, and that when the sailor leaves he will not see the island again as it will become water. The ship arrives and the serpent asks him to \\"make me a good name in your town\\" and gives him many precious gifts including spices, incense, elephants' tusks, greyhounds and baboons. The sailor returns home and gives the king the gifts he took from the island, and the king makes him an attendant and gives him serfs.

His grandmother was Lucrezia de' Medici, sister of pope Leo X and eldest daughter of Lorenzo il Magnifico. In 1561 he was appointed as bishop of Saint-Papoul in France, and later was apostolic nuncio in the same country. Pope Gregory XIII created him as cardinal on December 12, 1583. After becoming Cardinal he went in charge of the Ministers to the Sick. Salviati was mostly known for having been a benefactor. In Rome, he refounded the Arcispedale of San Giacomo degli Incurabili (rebuilding the annexed baroque-style Church of San Giacomo in Augusta) and founded the Collegio Salviati at his own expense at the end of 16th century, then he gifted them to the city of Rome. Other funding from him were towards the Hospital of San Rocco in favor of women in childbirth. It is notable that Salviati planned a long-term (in his will, forever) financial sustainability of the San Giacomo thanks to the donation from him of a rich property fund.Francesca Di Castro, L'Ospedale di San Giacomo degli Incurabili, Strenna dei Romanisti, 2009.

Many union leaders of the CIO and AFL considered it a Communist front. In 1951 it was officially branded a communist front organization by U.S. attorney general Herbert Brownwell.  History =Background From the early 20th Century, the American radical movement attempted to build bridges to the African-American working class as a potentially revolutionary force — isolated from mainstream middle class life by racism, excluded for the same reason from membership in many trade unions, and consigned as a social caste to the most menial occupations at inferior wages. The forerunners of the Communist Party, USA made early connection with the African Blood Brotherhood, lending that organization financial support, and fully sponsored its successor in 1925, the American Negro Labor Congress. During the Great Depression of the 1930s and the years of World War II, great advances were made by American organized labor in quantitative terms. From just over 3.7 million unionized workers in 1935, the ranks of organized labor swelled to 8.94 million in 1940 and approximated 15 million in 1950 — nearly a third of the entire national work force.US Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1957. Washington, DC: US Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, 1960, pg. 98; cited in Mindy Thompson, The National Negro Labor Council: A History. New York: American Institute for Marxist Studies, 1978; pg. 4, Black workers made a significant part of this growth, thanks in measure to the more open industrial unions of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), with an estimated 1 to 1.5 million black Americans in union ranks by 1950.Thompson, The National Negro Labor Council, pg. 4. During the years of World War II, black union workers joined nationally in support of the American war effort in the Negro Labor Victory Committee, founded in February 1941 under the direction of Ferdinand Smith, head of the National Maritime Union (NMU) of the CIO.Thompson, The National Negro Labor Council, pp. 4-5. This organization attempted to build a network of black union officials for joint action on behalf of the war and held mass meetings in Madison Square Garden in 1943 and 1944 to publicize black labor's support of the American government's cause.Thompson, The National Negro Labor Council, pg. 5. The Negro Labor Victory Committee was disbanded at the conclusion of the war in 1945 and members of the organization were encouraged to join the Trade Union Committee of the National Negro Congress to work for the amelioration of the endemic social and economic problems facing black workers. The wartime gains of black workers were largely erased during the second half of the 1940s, with the principle of \\"last hired, first fired\\" having drastic effect with the return of millions of American men from war to the work force.Thompson, The National Negro Labor Council, pg. 6. African-American men, who as a group had held 15.9 percent of factory jobs in 1940, saw their share fall to just 8.5 percent in 1950. Male black employment in the professions rose from 2.8 percent in 1940 to 3.3 percent during the height of the war before falling to 2.6 in 1950 — lower than the pre-war level.National Negro Labor Council, The Truth about the FEPC Fight. Detroit: National Negro Labor Council, 1953; pg. 2. Cited in Thompson, The National Negro Labor Council, pg. 6. Dissatisfaction with the faltering economic situation faced by black workers and a desire for a new labor offensive on their behalf was widespread among African-American labor officialdom. Preparations During 1950 it was determined that a new national organization, the National Negro Labor Council (NNLC) should be established. The chief organizer of the founding convention was Ernest \\"Big Train\\" Thompson, a former foundry worker in a radiator plant in Bayonne, New Jersey, who had later become the first black organizer of the Communist-led United Electrical, Radio, and Machine Workers of America (UE), a member organization of the CIO.Thompson, The National Negro Labor Council, pp. 9-11. Thompson traveled from coast to coast visiting local labor leaders and making the case for the new organization, finding a particularly positive reception in New York City, Chicago, Cleveland, Louisville, Detroit, and San Francisco.Thompson, The National Negro Labor Council, pg. 11. A number of key union activists came on board with the project, including Bill Hood of the United Auto Workers (UAW) and future Detroit mayor Coleman Young of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers (ACW), both constituent unions of the CIO.Thompson, The National Negro Labor Council, pg. 9. A series of meetings were held by leaders from the industrial midwest in preparation for the organization's founding, with extensive debates held over the multiple strands of difficulty faced by black workers — racial, class, and national.Thompson, The National Negro Labor Council, pp. 11-12. The relationship of the new organization to white workers was extensively discussed, and a commitment was forged to black leadership of the black workers' organization — a departure from the racial composition of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which historically featured a disproportionately large number of whites among the ranks of its top leadership.Thompson, The National Negro Labor Council, pg. 12. The radical roots of the organization were apparent to conservative and anti-communist liberal labor leaders, with Walter Reuther of the UAW and James Carey of the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (IUE) issuing statements urging their members to boycott the new organization.Thompson, The National Negro Labor Council, pg. 14. Cincinnati was chosen as the location for the group's founding convention, a provocative choice given the city's status as a Jim Crow town, in which blacks were systematically denied accommodation in white hotels, while black hotels possessed insufficient rooms to house all visiting delegates.Thompson, The National Negro Labor Council, pg. 16. Victoria Garvin, a vice president of the Distributive, Processing and Office Workers of America, another CIO union, spent several months arranging hotel rooms, finding housing in private homes, and negotiating with a hostile city government over the forthcoming convention, the convocation of which was publicized with 15,000 printed copies of a call sent out to union locals around the country. Founding convention The founding convention of the National Negro Labor Council was gaveled to order at noon on October 27, 1951, with the 1100 assembled delegates joining together to sing \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" and the black anthem \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing.\\"Thompson, The National Negro Labor Council, pg. 19. Development By 1951, twenty three NLC chapters were established across the nation. In October of that same year, representatives from all 23 chapters met again in Cincinnati, Ohio and founded the National Negro Labor Council. When the National Negro Labor Council began cooperating with the union leaders, things did not work as planned. Appeals were made to elect black officers, but they were urgently met with racism charges. It was a reversal to continue to hold down the deeply oppressed minority. The National Negro Labor Council was involved in various important battles which aided in the advancement of a group of people. It aided in militant strikes to obtain jobs for blacks, it also attempted to stop brutal slayings of blacks by law enforcement, and to attempt to gain access and full use of public transportation. with all of its prosperity and good causes, there comes negative publicity as well. The NNLC carried out many things such as militant strikes, campaigns to acquire more jobs for Afro-Americans, gain the right to vote or to use public facilities. The organization led job campaigns against companies such as Sears-Roebuck, Ford Motor Company, General Electric and others. But instead of focusing on the issues raised by NNLC, some union leaders of the AFL and CIO decided to attack the NNLC. As a result, it caused investigations by the McCarthyite House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). HUAC charged NNLC of having communist sympathies.  Charges before the House Un-American Activities Committee  Although this organization had accomplished many tasks relating to civil rights and race discrimination, it came to an end in 1956. It was called before the Subversive Activities Control Board. The organization was accused of being a Communist front organization. Defense lawyers ran up an enormous legal defense bill which the organization was not able to pay. When the charges began to amount to an uncontrollable portion, the NNCL decided to vote. When the vote was counted, it was decided that it would dissolve itself. The legal charges were too much for the organization to handle and remain prosperous, so this decision had to be made.

It first opened in 1869 by the Metropolitan Board of Works as one of its first parks. It was designed by Alexander McKenzie and covers . It takes its name from being in what was the old Parliamentary constituency of Southwark at the time of its opening. It received £2.5 million from the National Lottery's Heritage Lottery Fund in 1998 which enabled large parts of the park to be refurbished. The park is protected by Fields in Trust through a legal \\"Deed of Dedication\\" safeguarding the future of the space as public recreation land for future generations to enjoy. Facilities and Activities Southwark Park: Bandstand The bandstand dates from 1884 and was originally sited in the Royal Horticultural Society grounds at South Kensington. It has a sister in Peckham Rye Park. The Old English Cottage Garden was designed by Col. J.J. Sexby, Parks Superintendent for the London County Council. The idea for the rose garden came from Dr Alfred Salter, Member of Parliament for West Bermondsey. It was opened in 1936 and was named after Ada Salter when she died in 1943. Other facilities include a cafe, a wildlife garden, a boating lake and an art gallery. Sports facilities include an athletics track run by Fusion, a bowling green, football pitches, a cricket pitch and tennis courts. The park also has a contained children's playground with swings, a slide and other small rides.The park is also home to Southwark parkrun, one of the many free, weekly 5k runs held in both the UK and internationally. It is held every Saturday at 9.00am (GMT). There are \\"Friends of Southwark Park\\" and \\"Young Friends of Southwark Park\\" groups to encourage the community to get involved in the management of their park. The Friends of Southwark Park is a non-party- political community organisation, recognised by the London Borough of Southwark. Its primary role is to liaise with, and encourage the Council to look after the parks in the interests of the people who use them. Trees As with many spaces within London, the Plane tree (Platanus x hispanica) is dominant within Southwark park particularly the northernmost section around the bandstand, which runs next to Jamaica Road. However, the park is also rich in trees less common in London. Opposite the entrance to the art gallery is a Walnut tree (Juglans regia) and a series of three or four Silver Maples (Acer saccharinum). There is as also a Red Oak (Quercus rubra) close to these maples. Next to the duck pond and the garden area there are three Swamp Cypresses (Taxodium distichum), although without the distinctive wooden 'knees' which sometimes surround trees of this variety. Transport There are three London Overground stations (formerly on the London Underground network's East London Line) and two London Underground stations (One sharing with the London Overground) located near the edges of Southwark Park. In clockwise order starting from the west, they are: * Bermondsey (Jubilee line) * Rotherhithe (London Overground) * Canada Water (London Overground and Jubilee line) * Surrey Quays (London Overground) Local buses 47, 188, 381, C10 and P12 buses serve the park at the Jamaica Road entrance. At night the park is served by N199 and N381 buses, while the 47 and 188 buses runs a 24-hour service. The P12 also serves the park as it travels along Southwark Park Road and stops near the entrance there. Local buses 1, 199 and N1 buses stop nearby the park along Lower Road, at Surrey Quays Station, near the Lower Road entrance and at Rotherhithe Police Station, which is across from Gomm Road, where another entrance to the park is at the end of it. The 1 and 381 buses, along with their night routes; N1 and N381 also stop at Warndon Street, on Rotherhithe New Road, this is the closest stop to the Hawkstone Road entrance.

A 3DO Interactive Multiplayer version was planned but never released. Gameplay Absolute Zero is set in the 24th century, on the frozen Jovian moon of Europa, where mankind has established a colony to extract water for fusion reactors. When one of the mining facilities accidentally discovers members of a long- buried alien race, the creatures awaken to slaughter all the miners and destroy the colony's capital city. Using only the minimal defensive equipment located on the colony, it's up to you to thwart the attack until help arrives.

The oldest known paintings are at the Grotte Chauvet in France, claimed by some historians to be about 32,000 years old. They are engraved and painted using red ochre and black pigment and show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth, or humans often hunting. There are examples of cave paintings all over the world—in France, India, Spain, Portugal, China, Australia etc. There are many common themes throughout the different places that the paintings have been found; implying the universality of purpose and similarity of the impulses that might have inspired the artists to create the imagery. Various conjectures have been made as to the meaning these paintings had to the artists who made them. Prehistoric men may have painted animals to \\"catch\\" their soul or spirit in order to hunt them more easily, or the paintings may represent an animistic vision and homage to surrounding nature, or they may be the result of a basic need of expression that is innate to human beings, or they may be recordings of the life experiences of the artists and related stories from the members of their circle.

File:Dura Synagogue WC3 David anointed by Samuel.jpgDura Europos Synagogue, Roman Syria, fresco showing David anointed by Samuel, 3rd century AD Ancient Egypt, a civilization with strong traditions of architecture and sculpture (both originally painted in bright colors), had many mural paintings in temples and buildings, and painted illustrations on papyrus manuscripts. Egyptian wall painting and decorative painting is often graphic, sometimes more symbolic than realistic. Egyptian painting depicts figures in bold outline and flat silhouette, in which symmetry is a constant characteristic. Egyptian painting has close connection with its written language—called Egyptian hieroglyphs. Painted symbols are found amongst the first forms of written language. The Egyptians also painted on linen, remnants of which survive today. Ancient Egyptian paintings survived due to the extremely dry climate. The ancient Egyptians created paintings to make the afterlife of the deceased a pleasant place. The themes included journey through the afterworld or their protective deities introducing the dead to the gods of the underworld. Some examples of such paintings are paintings of the gods and goddesses Ra, Horus, Anubis, Nut, Osiris and Isis. Some tomb paintings show activities that the deceased were involved in when they were alive and wished to carry on doing for eternity. In the New Kingdom and later, the Book of the Dead was buried with the entombed person. It was considered important for an introduction to the afterlife. To the north of Egypt was the Minoan civilization on the island of Crete. The wall paintings found in the palace of Knossos are similar to those of the Egyptians but much more free in style. A fresco showing Hades and Persephone riding in a chariot, from the tomb of Queen Eurydice I of Macedon at Vergina, Greece, 4th century BC Around 1100 BC, tribes from the north of Greece conquered Greece and its art took a new direction. The culture of ancient Greece is noteworthy for its outstanding contributions to the visual arts. Painting on pottery of ancient Greece and ceramics gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in ancient Greece functioned. Many fine examples of black-figure vase painting and red-figure vase painting still exist. Some famous Greek painters who worked on wood panels and are mentioned in texts are Apelles, Zeuxis and Parrhasius; however, with the single exception of the Pitsa panels, no examples of ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or later Romans. Zeuxis lived in the 5th century BC and was said to be the first to use sfumato. According to Pliny the Elder, the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes. Apelles is described as the greatest painter of antiquity, and is noted for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color, and modeling. Roman art was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Surviving Roman paintings include wall paintings and frescoes, many from villas in Campania, in Southern Italy at sites such as Pompeii and Herculaneum. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main \\"styles\\" or periods and may contain the first examples of trompe-l'œil, pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape. Almost the only painted portraits surviving from the ancient world are a large number of coffin- portraits of bust form found in the Late Antique cemetery of Al-Fayum. Although these were neither of the best period nor the highest quality, they are impressive in themselves, and give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had. A very small number of miniatures from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period.

Byzantine art, once its style was established by the 6th century, placed great emphasis on retaining traditional iconography and style, and gradually evolved during the thousand years of the Byzantine Empire and the living traditions of Greek and Russian Orthodox icon-painting. Byzantine painting has a hieratic feeling and icons were and still are seen as a representation of divine revelation. There were many frescos, but fewer of these have survived than mosaics. Byzantine art has been compared to contemporary abstraction, in its flatness and highly stylised depictions of figures and landscape. Some periods of Byzantine art, especially the so-called Macedonian art of around the 10th century, are more flexible in approach. Frescos of the Palaeologian Renaissance of the early 14th century survive in the Chora Church in Istanbul. Giotto In post-Antique Catholic Europe the first distinctive artistic style to emerge that included painting was the Insular art of the British Isles, where the only surviving examples are miniatures in Illuminated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells.Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print. These are most famous for their abstract decoration, although figures, and sometimes scenes, were also depicted, especially in Evangelist portraits. Carolingian and Ottonian art also survives mostly in manuscripts, although some wall- painting remain, and more are documented. The art of this period combines Insular and \\"barbarian\\" influences with a strong Byzantine influence and an aspiration to recover classical monumentality and poise. Walls of Romanesque and Gothic churches were decorated with frescoes as well as sculpture and many of the few remaining murals have great intensity, and combine the decorative energy of Insular art with a new monumentality in the treatment of figures. Far more miniatures in Illuminated manuscripts survive from the period, showing the same characteristics, which continue into the Gothic period. Panel painting becomes more common during the Romanesque period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons. Towards the middle of the 13th century, Medieval art and Gothic painting became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with Cimabue and then his pupil Giotto. From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative. They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture. Cimabue, within the Byzantine tradition, used a more realistic and dramatic approach to his art. His pupil, Giotto, took these innovations to a higher level which in turn set the foundations for the western painting tradition. Both artists were pioneers in the move towards naturalism. Churches were built with more and more windows and the use of colorful stained glass become a staple in decoration. One of the most famous examples of this is found in the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris. By the 14th century Western societies were both richer and more cultivated and painters found new patrons in the nobility and even the bourgeoisie. Illuminated manuscripts took on a new character and slim, fashionably dressed court women were shown in their landscapes. This style soon became known as International Gothic style and was dominant from 1375–1425 with and tempera panel paintings and altarpieces gaining importance.

Central Panel L'Annonciation by Campin with side panels done by an assistant The Renaissance (French for 'rebirth'), a cultural movement roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th century, was driven by Renaissance humanism and the study of classical sources. In painting, in the 1420s and 1430s leading painters in Italy and the Low Countries separately developed new ways of painting which allowed the paintings to appear more realistic than in the works of established painters, whose style is referred to as International Gothic, or in some cases as Proto-Renaissance (mainly in Italy). This period, lasting until about 1495, became known as the Early Renaissance. In the Flanders area of the Low Countries, following developments made in the illumination of manuscripts, especially by the Limbourg Brothers, who died in 1416, artists became fascinated by the tangible in the visible world and began representing objects in an extremely naturalistic way.Gardner, H., Kleiner, F. S., & Mamiya, C. J. (2006). Gardner's art through the ages: the Western perspective. Belmont, CA, Thomson Wadsworth: 430–437 The adoption of oil painting whose first use on panel paintings was traditionally, but erroneously, credited to Jan van Eyck, made possible a new verisimilitude in depicting this naturalism. The medium of oil paint was already present in the work of Melchior Broederlam (who died in 1409), but Robert Campin (previously known as the Master of Flémalle) and van Eyck brought its use to new heights and employed it to represent the naturalism for which they were aiming. With this new medium, the painters of this period were capable of creating richer colors with a deep intense tonality. The illusion of glowing light with a porcelain-like finish characterized Early Netherlandish painting and was a major difference to the matte surface of tempera paint used in Italy. Fra Angelico, 1425–1428 Unlike the Italians, whose work drew heavily from the art of ancient Rome, the northerners retained a stylistic residue of the sculpture and illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages (especially its naturalism). Another important Netherlandish painter of this period was Rogier van der Weyden, a pupil of Campin, whose compositions stressed human emotion and drama, demonstrated for instance in his Descent from the Cross, which ranks among the most famous works of the 15th century and was the most influential Netherlandish painting of Christ's crucifixion. Other important artists were Hugo van der Goes (whose work was highly influential in Italy), Dieric Bouts (who was among the first northern painters to demonstrate the use of a single vanishing point), Petrus Christus, Hans Memling and Gerard David. Collectively, the advances in painting in Europe north of the Alps is known as the Northern Renaissance. In Italian Renaissance painting, the art of Classical antiquity inspired a style of painting that emphasized the ideal. Masaccio is credited with making advances in linear perspective, the depiction of volume in his figures, and in portraying emotions on the faces of his figures in the 1420s. Then, artists such as Paolo Uccello, Fra Angelico, Piero della Francesca, Andrea Mantegna, Filippo Lippi, and Sandro Botticelli, in the Early Renaissance period lasting to about 1495, and then Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, and Raphael during the High Renaissance from about 1495 to 1520, took painting to a higher level through the use of perspective, the study of human anatomy and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. A somewhat more naturalistic High Renaissance style emerged in Venice. Painters of the Venetian school, such as Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione, Titian, and Veronese, were less concerned with precision in their drawing than with the richness of color and unity of effect that could be achieved by a more spontaneous approach to painting. Flemish, Dutch and German painters of the Northern High Renaissance such as Albrecht Dürer, Lucas Cranach, Matthias Grünewald, and Hans Holbein the Younger had a different approach than their Italian counterparts, one that is more realistic and less idealized. Some northern painters, beginning with Dürer in the 1490s, traveled to Italy to see works of the Italian High Renaissance and they incorporated the features of the Italian art into their own to varying degrees.A generation later, the start of genre painting as a subject for large works began with Peter Aertsen and Pieter Bruegel. A later generation of Northern Renaissance painters who traveled to Rome and adopted much of the idealized approach of the Italian Renaissance became known as Romanists. Titian, 1520–1523 Renaissance painting reflects the revolution of ideas and science (astronomy, geography) that occurred in this period, the Reformation, and the invention of the printing press. Printmaking became increasingly important, and practiced by many painters. Dürer, considered one of the greatest of printmakers, states that painters are not mere artisans but thinkers as well. With the development of easel painting in the Renaissance, painting gained independence from architecture. Easel paintings—movable pictures which could be hung easily on walls—became a popular alternative to paintings fixed to furniture, walls or other structures. Following centuries dominated by religious imagery, secular subject matter slowly returned to Western painting. Artists included visions of the world around them, or the products of their own imaginations in their paintings. Those who could afford the expense could become patrons and commission portraits of themselves or their family. The High Renaissance in Italy gave rise to a stylized art known as Mannerism after 1520, although some painters, such as Titian and Paolo Veronese, continued painting in a High Renaissance style late into the century. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterized art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The calm Virgins of Raphael and serene expressions of Leonardo's subjects are replaced by the troubled expressions of Pontormo and the emotional intensity of El Greco. Restless and unstable compositions, often extreme or disjunctive effects of perspective, and stylized poses are characteristic of Italian Mannerists such as Tintoretto, Pontormo, and Bronzino, and appeared later in the work of Northern Mannerists such as Hendrick Goltzius, Bartholomeus Spranger, and Joachim Wtewael.

Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, \\"Gardner's Art Through the Ages\\" (Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2005) Baroque painting is characterized by great drama, rich, deep color, and intense light and dark shadows with the purpose of the art being to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance. The earliest Baroque painters included the Caracci brothers, Annibale and Agostino, in the last score of the 16th century, and Caravaggio in the last decade of the century. Caravaggio is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque painters and an heir of the humanist painting of the High Renaissance. His realistic approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting. Baroque was the dominant style of painting beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century. Among the greatest painters of the Baroque are Rubens, Velázquez, Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Johannes Vermeer, Le Nain, Jusepe de Ribera, Poussin, Tour, and Claude Lorraine, who focused on landscape painting. Poussin, Claude and La Tour, all French, adopted a \\"classical\\" Baroque style with less focus on emotion and greater attention to the outine of the figures in the painting than on colour. Most of these painters traveled to Italy as part of their training and would then take the Baroque style back to their homelands, although in some cases they remained in Italy for large portions of their career (Claude and Poussin). In Italy, the Baroque style is epitomized by religious and mythological paintings in the Grand Manner by artists such as the Carracci, Guido Reni, and Luca Giordano. Illusionistic church ceiling frescoes by Pietro da Cortona seemed to open to the sky. Rembrandt van Rijn, The Jewish Bride, ca. 1665–1669 A much quieter type of Baroque emerged in the Dutch Republic, where easel paintings of everyday subjects were popular with middle-class collectors, and many painters became specialists in genre, others in landscape or seascape or still life. Vermeer, Gerard ter Borch, and Pieter de Hooch brought great technical refinement to the painting of domestic scenes, as did Willem Claesz. Heda to still life. In contrast, Rembrandt excelled in painting every type of subject, and developed an individual painterly style in which the chiaroscuro and dark backgrounds derived from Caravaggio and the Utrecht Caravaggists lose their theatrical quality. Dutch Baroque painting is often referred to as Dutch Golden Age Painting. During the 18th century, Rococo painting followed as a lighter extension of Baroque, often frivolous and erotic and using light pastel colours. Rococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design in France. Louis XV's succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion. The 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France exemplified by the works of Antoine Watteau and François Boucher. Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions. The Rococo style spread with French artists and engraved publications. It was readily received in the Catholic parts of Germany, Bohemia, and Austria, where it was merged with the lively German Baroque traditions. German Rococo was applied with enthusiasm to churches and palaces, particularly in the south, while Frederician Rococo developed in the Kingdom of Prussia. The French masters Watteau, Boucher and Fragonard represent the style, as do Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin who was considered by some as the best French painter of the 18th century – the Anti-Rococo. Portraiture was an important component of painting in all countries, but especially in England, where the leaders were William Hogarth, in a blunt realist style, and Francis Hayman, Angelica Kauffman (who was Swiss), Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds in more flattering styles influenced by Anthony van Dyck. In France during the Rococo era Jean-Baptiste Greuze (the favorite painter of Denis Diderot),Edmond and Jules de Goncourt, French Eighteenth-Century Painters. Cornell Paperbacks, 1981, pp. 222–225. excelled in portraits and history paintings, and Maurice Quentin de La Tour and Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun were highly accomplished portrait painters. La Tour specialized in pastel painting, which became a popular medium during this period. William Hogarth helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not intentionally referencing the movement, he argued in his Analysis of Beauty (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in Classicism). The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like Voltaire and Jacques-François Blondel began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art. Blondel decried the \\"ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants\\" in contemporary interiors.Uni-Heidelberg.de By 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of Neoclassical artists such as Jacques-Louis David, whose imposing history paintings depicting both historical and contemporary events embodied the ideals of the French Revolution. 19th century: Neo-classicism, History painting, Romanticism, Impressionism, Post Impressionism, Symbolism File:David_- _The_Death_of_Socrates.jpgJacques-Louis David, 1787 File:Watsonandtheshark- original.jpgJohn Singleton Copley, 1778 File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Bonaparte visitant les pestiférés de Jaffa.jpgAntoine-Jean Gros, 1804 File:Constable DeadhamVale.jpgJohn Constable, 1802 File:Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres - La Baigneuse Valpinçon.jpgJean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, 1808 File:El Tres de Mayo, by Francisco de Goya, from Prado thin black margin.jpgFrancisco Goya, 1814 File:JEAN LOUIS THÉODORE GÉRICAULT - La Balsa de la Medusa (Museo del Louvre, 1818-19).jpgThéodore Géricault, 1819 File:Caspar_David_Friedrich_- _Mondaufgang_am_Meer_-_Google_Art_Project.jpgCaspar David Friedrich, c. 1822 File:Karl Brullov - The Last Day of Pompeii - Google Art Project.jpgKarl Brullov, 1827 File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpgEugène Delacroix, 1830 File:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpgJ.

Ingres' work already contains much of the sensuality, but none of the spontaneity, that was to characterize Romanticism. By the mid-19th century, painters became liberated from the demands of their patronage to only depict scenes from religion, mythology, portraiture or history. Art became more purely a means of personal expression in the work of painters like Francisco de Goya, John Constable, and J. M. W. Turner. Romantic painters turned landscape painting into a major genre, considered until then as a minor genre or as a decorative background for figure compositions. Some of the major painters of this period are Eugène Delacroix, Théodore Géricault, J. M. W. Turner, Caspar David Friedrich and John Constable. Francisco Goya's late work demonstrates the Romantic interest in the irrational, the work of Arnold Böcklin evokes mystery, the work of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in England combines assiduous devotion to nature with nostalgia for medieval culture, and the paintings of Aesthetic movement artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler evoke sophistication, decadence, and the philosophy of \\"art for art's sake\\". In the United States the Romantic tradition of landscape painting was known as the Hudson River School: exponents include Thomas Cole, Frederic Edwin Church, Albert Bierstadt, Thomas Moran, and John Frederick Kensett. Luminism was a movement in American landscape painting related to the Hudson River School. Johan Jongkind, 1871, a prefiguration of impressionism A major force in the turn towards Realism at mid-century was Gustave Courbet, whose unidealized paintings of common people offended viewers accustomed to the conventional subject matter and licked finish of academic art, but inspired many younger artists. The leading Barbizon School painter Jean-François Millet also painted landscapes and scenes of peasant life. Loosely associated with the Barbizon School was Camille Corot, who painted in both a romantic and a realistic vein; his work prefigures Impressionism, as did the paintings of Johan Jongkind and Eugène Boudin (who was one of the first French landscape painters to paint outdoors). Boudin was an important influence on the young Claude Monet, whom in 1857 he introduced to plein air painting. In the latter third of the century Impressionists such as Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Berthe Morisot, Mary Cassatt, and Edgar Degas worked in a more direct approach than had previously been exhibited publicly. They eschewed allegory and narrative in favor of individualized responses to the modern world, sometimes painted with little or no preparatory study, relying on deftness of drawing and a highly chromatic palette. Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley used the landscape as their primary motif, the transience of light and weather playing a major role in their work. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air, but not for the traditional purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio.Bomford, David, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, Ashok Roy, and Raymond White (1990). Impressionism. London: National Gallery. pp. 21–27. . By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they developed a lighter and brighter manner of painting. Edvard Munch, 1893, early example of Expressionism Manet, Degas, Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt concentrated primarily on the human subject. Both Manet and Degas reinterpreted classical figurative canons within contemporary situations; in Manet's case the re-imaginings met with hostile public reception. Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt turned to domestic life for inspiration, with Renoir focusing on the female nude. While Sisley most closely adhered to the original principals of the Impressionist perception of the landscape, Monet sought challenges in increasingly chromatic and changeable conditions, culminating in his series of monumental works of Water Lilies painted in Giverny. Post- Impressionists such as Paul Cézanne and the slightly younger Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, and Georges-Pierre Seurat led art to the edge of modernism. For Gauguin Impressionism gave way to a personal symbolism. Seurat transformed Impressionism's broken color into a scientific optical study, structured on frieze-like compositions. The painting technique he developed, called Divisionism, attracted many followers such as Paul Signac, and for a few years in the late 1880s Pissarro adopted some of his methods. Van Gogh's turbulent method of paint application, coupled with a sonorous use of color, predicted Expressionism and Fauvism, and Cézanne, desiring to unite classical composition with a revolutionary abstraction of natural forms, would come to be seen as a precursor of 20th-century art. The spell of Impressionism was felt throughout the world, including in the United States, where it became integral to the painting of American Impressionists such as Childe Hassam, John Henry Twachtman, and Theodore Robinson. It also exerted influence on painters who were not primarily Impressionistic in theory, like the portrait and landscape painter John Singer Sargent. At the same time in America at the turn of the 20th century there existed a native and nearly insular realism, as richly embodied in the figurative work of Thomas Eakins, the Ashcan School, and the landscapes and seascapes of Winslow Homer, all of whose paintings were deeply invested in the solidity of natural forms. The visionary landscape, a motive largely dependent on the ambiguity of the nocturne, found its advocates in Albert Pinkham Ryder and Ralph Albert Blakelock. In the late 19th century there also were several, rather dissimilar, groups of Symbolist painters whose works resonated with younger artists of the 20th century, especially with the Fauvists and the Surrealists. Among them were Gustave Moreau, Odilon Redon, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Henri Fantin-Latour, Arnold Böcklin, Ferdinand Hodler, Edvard Munch, Félicien Rops, Jan Toorop, and Gustav Klimt, and the Russian Symbolists such as Mikhail Vrubel. Symbolist painters mined mythology and dream imagery for a visual language of the soul, seeking evocative paintings that brought to mind a static world of silence. The symbols used in Symbolism are not the familiar emblems of mainstream iconography but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, the Symbolist painters influenced the contemporary Art Nouveau movement and Les Nabis. In their exploration of dreamlike subjects, symbolist painters are found across centuries and cultures, as they are still today; Bernard Delvaille has described René Magritte's surrealism as \\"Symbolism plus Freud\\".Delvaille, Bernard, La poésie symboliste: anthologie, introduction. 20th century File:Matisse-Woman-with-a-Hat.jpgHenri Matisse, 1905, Fauvism File:Rousseau-Hungry-Lion.jpgHenri Rousseau, 1905, the reason for the term Fauvism] and the original \\"Wild Beast\\" File:Matissedance.jpgHenri Matisse, 1909, late Fauvism File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpgPablo Picasso, 1907, early Cubism File:Violin and Candlestick.jpgGeorges Braque, 1910, Analytic Cubism File:Juan Gris - Portrait of Pablo Picasso - Google Art Project.jpgJuan Gris, 1912, Cubism File:De Chirico's Love Song.jpgGiorgio de Chirico, 1914, pre-Surrealism Fernand Léger, 1919, Synthetic Cubism, Tubism The heritage of painters like Van Gogh, Cézanne, Gauguin, and Seurat was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist Georges Braque, André Derain, Raoul Dufy and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with \\"wild\\", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism. Henri Matisse's second version of The Dance signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.Russell T. Clement. Four French Symbolists. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114. It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with primitive art: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and hedonism. Pablo Picasso made his first cubist paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: cube, sphere and cone. With the painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), Picasso created a new and radical picture depicting a brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of African tribal masks and his own Cubist inventions. Cubism was jointly developed from about 1908 through 1912 by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, whose Violin and Candlestick, Paris (1910) is shown here. The first clear manifestation of Cubism was practised by Braque, Picasso, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand Léger, Henri Le Fauconnier, and Robert Delaunay. Juan Gris, Marcel Duchamp, Alexander Archipenko, Joseph Csaky and others soon joined. Synthetic cubism, practiced by Braque and Picasso, is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, collage elements, papier collé and a large variety of merged subject matter. The Salon d'Automne of 1905 brought notoriety and attention to the works of Henri Matisse and Fauvism. The group gained their name after critic Louis Vauxcelles described their work with the phrase \\"Donatello chez les fauves\\" (\\"Donatello among the wild beasts\\"),Louis Vauxcelles, Le Salon d'Automne, Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

Vauxcelles' comment was printed on 17 October 1905 in the daily newspaper Gil Blas, and passed into popular usage.Elderfield, 43 In the first two decades of the 20th century and after cubism, several other important movements emerged; Futurism (Balla), Abstract art (Kandinsky) Der Blaue Reiter (Kandinsky and Franz Marc), Bauhaus (Kandinsky and Klee), Orphism, (Delaunay and Kupka), Synchromism (Russell), De Stijl (van Doesburg and Mondrian), Suprematism (Malevich), Constructivism (Tatlin), Dadaism (Duchamp, Picabia and Arp), and Surrealism (de Chirico, André Breton, Miró, Magritte, Dalí and Ernst). Modern painting influenced all the visual arts, from Modernist architecture and design, to avant-garde film, theatre and modern dance and became an experimental laboratory for the expression of visual experience, from photography and concrete poetry to advertising art and fashion. =Fauvism, Der Blaue Reiter, Die Brücke= File:Wassily Kandinsky, 1903, The Blue Rider (Der Blaue Reiter), oil on canvas, 52.1 x 54.6 cm, Stiftung Sammlung E.G.

The leaders of the movement were Henri Matisse and André Derain – friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers. Ultimately Matisse became the yang to Picasso's yin in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included Albert Marquet, Charles Camoin, Maurice de Vlaminck, Raoul Dufy, Othon Friesz, the Dutch painter Kees van Dongen, and Picasso's partner in Cubism, Georges Braque amongst others.The \\"Wild Beasts\\" Fauvism and its Affinities, John Elderfield, Museum of Modern Art 1976, Fauvism had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907. They had only three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse, The Green Stripe, caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight, and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer Ambroise Vollard, André Derain went to London and produced a series of paintings including Charing Cross Bridge, London in the Fauvist style, paraphrasing the famous series by the Impressionist painter Claude Monet. By 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, and Appolinaire said of Matisse in an article published in La Falange, \\"We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable.\\"Picasso and Braque pioneering cubism William Rubin, published by the Museum of Modern Art, New York, copyright 1989, p. 348. Die Brücke was a group of German expressionist artists formed in Dresden in 1905. Founding members were Fritz Bleyl, Erich Heckel, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. Later members included Max Pechstein and Otto Mueller. This seminal group had a major impact on the evolution of modern art in the 20th century and created the style of Expressionism.\\"The Artists' Association 'Brücke'\\", Brücke Museum.

Wassily Kandinsky, Franz Marc, August Macke, Alexej von Jawlensky, whose psychically expressive painting of the Russian dancer Portrait of Alexander Sakharoff (1909) is seen here, Marianne von Werefkin, Lyonel Feininger and others founded the Der Blaue Reiter group in response to the rejection of Kandinsky's painting Last Judgement from an exhibition. Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists Gabriele Münter and Paul Klee were also involved. The name of the movement comes from a 1903 painting by Kandinsky. For Kandinsky, blue is the color of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.Der Blaue Reiter, Tate Glossary retrieved 10 August 2009 =Expressionism, Symbolism, American Modernism, Bauhaus= File:The Kiss - Gustav Klimt - Google Cultural Institute.jpgGustav Klimt, Expressionism, 1907–1908 File:Chagall IandTheVillage.jpgMarc Chagall, Expressionism and Surrealism, 1911 File:Nature Symbolized.jpgArthur Dove, early American modernism, 1911 File:Egon Schiele - Self-Portrait with Physalis - Google Art Project.jpgEgon Schiele, Symbolism and Expressionism, 1912 File:Bonnard-the dining room in the country.jpgPierre Bonnard, 1913, European modernist Narrative painting File:Modigliani - Nu couché.jpgAmedeo Modigliani, Symbolism and Expressionism, 1917 File:Portrait of a German Officer, Marsden Hartley.jpgMarsden Hartley, American modernism, 1914 File:Tale à la Hoffmann MET DT1768.jpgPaul Klee, Bauhaus, 1921 File:Davis_Stuart_Lucky_Strike_1921.jpgStuart Davis, American modernism, 1921 File:Patrick Henry Bruce - Painting.jpgPatrick Henry Bruce, American modernism, 1929–1930 Expressionism and Symbolism are broad rubrics that involve several related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the avant-garde art being made in Western, Eastern and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. Fauvism, Die Brücke, and Der Blaue Reiter are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters. Marc Chagall's painting I and the Village tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic Symbolism. Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, Edvard Munch, Emil Nolde, Chaim Soutine, James Ensor, Oskar Kokoschka, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Max Beckmann, Franz Marc, Georges Rouault, Amedeo Modigliani, and some Americans abroad such as Marsden Hartley and Stuart Davis, were considered influential expressionist painters. Although Alberto Giacometti is primarily thought of as a Surrealist sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well. American painters during the period between World War I and World War II tended to go to Europe for recognition. Modernist artists like Marsden Hartley, Patrick Henry Bruce, Gerald Murphy and Stuart Davis created reputations abroad. While Patrick Henry BruceAgee and Rose, 1979, p. 8. created cubist related paintings in Europe, both Stuart Davis and Gerald Murphy made paintings that were early inspirations for American pop artWayne Craven, American Art: History and Culture, p. 464.Jasonkaufman.com , accessed online 28 August 2007 and Marsden Hartley experimented with expressionism.

As an early modernist, he theorized as did contemporary occultists and theosophists, that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled as the example in the Composition VII, making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book Concerning the Spiritual in Art. Other major pioneers of early abstraction include Swedish painter Hilma af Klint, Russian painter Kazimir Malevich, and Swiss painter Paul Klee. Robert Delaunay was a French artist who is associated with Orphism, (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism). His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color and his experimentation of both depth and tone. =Dada and Surrealism= File:Picabia Machine Turn.jpgFrancis Picabia, 1916, Dada File:The Elephant Celebes.jpgMax Ernst, 1921), Surrealism File:Pedestal Table in the Studio.jpgAndré Masson, 1922, early Surrealism File:DasUndbild.jpgKurt Schwitters, 1919, painted collage, Dada File:Hoch-Cut With the Kitchen Knife.jpgHannah Höch, collage, 1919, Dada File:Murdering Airplane.jpgMax Ernst, 1920, early Surrealism File:Joan Miró, 1920, Horse, Pipe and Red Flower, oil on canvas, 82.6 x 74.9 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art.jpgJoan Miró, Horse, Pipe and Red Flower, 1920, early Surrealism Marcel Duchamp came to international prominence in the wake of the New York City Armory Show in 1913 where his Nude Descending a Staircase became a cause célèbre. He subsequently created The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even, Large Glass. The Large Glass pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp (who was soon to renounce artmaking for chess) became closely associated with the Dada movement that began in neutral Zürich, Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design to advance its antiwar politic and rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Other artists associated with the Dada movement include Francis Picabia, Man Ray, Kurt Schwitters, Hannah Höch, Tristan Tzara, Hans Richter, Jean Arp, and Sophie Taeuber-Arp. Duchamp and several Dadaists are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s. Marcel Duchamp, Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, 1912, Philadelphia Museum of Art In 1924 André Breton published the Surrealist Manifesto. The Surrealist movement in painting became synonymous with the avant-garde and featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like Machine Turn Quickly, Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the Dada movement through 1919 in Zürich and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in Surrealist art. Yves Tanguy, René Magritte and Salvador Dalí are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. During the 1920s André Masson's work was decisive in helping the young artist Joan Miró find his roots in Surrealist painting. Miró's The Tilled Field (1923–1924) verges on abstraction while suggesting a complex of objects and figures and arrangements of sexually active characters; it was Miró's first Surrealist masterpiece.Spector, Nancy. \\"The Tilled Field, 1923–1924 \\". Guggenheim display caption. Retrieved 30 May 2008. Joan Miró, Jean Arp, André Masson, and Max Ernst were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s. Max Ernst, whose 1920 painting Murdering Airplane is seen here, studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings may have been inspired by the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud's study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a castration complex. The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another. Throughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A Surrealist group developed in Britain and, according to Breton, their 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition was a high-water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in Latin America, the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works. Other prominent surrealist artists include Giorgio de Chirico, Méret Oppenheim, Toyen, Grégoire Michonze, Roberto Matta, Kay Sage, Leonora Carrington, Dorothea Tanning, and Leonor Fini. =Neue Sachlichkeit, Social realism, regionalism, American Scene painting, Symbolism= File:Republican Automatons George Grosz 1920.jpgGeorge Grosz, 1920, Neue Sachlichkeit File:People-of-Chilmark-Benton-1920-lrg.jpgThomas Hart Benton, 1920, Regionalism File:Bellows George Dempsey and Firpo 1924.jpgGeorge Bellows, 1924, American realism File:Demuth_Charles_Spring_1921.jpgCharles Demuth Spring, 1921, American Precisionism (proto Pop Art) File:Demuth Charles Chimney and Watertower 1931.jpgCharles Demuth, 1931, Precisionism File:Blue- green.jpgGeorgia O'Keeffe, 1921, Southwestern modernism File:Grant Wood - American Gothic - Google Art Project.jpgGrant Wood, American Gothic, 1930, Social Realism.

On 26 April 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, the Basque town of Gernika was the scene of the \\"Bombing of Gernika\\" by the Condor Legion of Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe.

The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then Scandinavia and London, and in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at MoMA. Finally in accord with Picasso's wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981. From the Great Depression of the 1930s through the years of World War II, American art was characterized by Social Realism and American Scene Painting. Regionalism movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world in the USA. Artists such as Ben Shahn, Thomas Hart Benton, Grant Wood, George Tooker, John Steuart Curry, Reginald Marsh, and others became prominent. American Gothic is a painting by Grant Wood from 1930. Portraying a pitchfork-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of Carpenter Gothic style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century American art. Art critics assumed it was satirical in intent; it was thought to be part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America exemplified by Sherwood Anderson's 1919 Winesburg, Ohio, Sinclair Lewis' 1920 Main Street, and Carl Van Vechten's The Tattooed Countess in literature.Fineman, Mia, The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates., Slate, 8 June 2005 However, with the onset of the Great Depression, the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit. A renaissance of the arts in Latin America included the Uruguayan painter Joaquín Torres García, the Mexican painter Rufino Tamayo, artists of the Mexican muralist movement such as Diego Rivera, David Siqueiros, José Orozco, Pedro Nel Gómez and Santiago Martinez Delgado, and the Symbolist painter Frida Kahlo. The muralists conveyed historic and political messages. Diego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, \\"Man at the Crossroads\\", in the lobby of the RCA Building at Rockefeller Center. When his patron Nelson Rockefeller discovered that the mural included a portrait of Lenin and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff. Frida Kahlo's works relate to Surrealism and to the Magic Realism movement in literature. Her works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are self-portraits, which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds.Herrera, Hayden. \\"Frida Kahlo\\". Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press =Abstract expressionism= Jackson Pollock, Blue Poles, 1952, National Gallery of Australia The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American abstract expressionism, a movement that combined lessons learned from European Modernists via great teachers in America like Hans Hofmann and John D. Graham. American artists benefited from the presence of Piet Mondrian, Fernand Léger, Max Ernst and the André Breton group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and Peggy Guggenheim's gallery The Art of This Century, as well as other factors. Barnett Newman, Onement 1, 1948. During the 1940s Barnett Newman wrote several articles about the new American painting. Post- Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, Mark Rothko, Hans Hofmann, Clyfford Still, Franz Kline, Adolph Gottlieb, Barnett Newman, Mark Tobey, James Brooks, Philip Guston, Robert Motherwell, Conrad Marca- Relli, Jack Tworkov, Esteban Vicente, William Baziotes, Richard Pousette-Dart, Ad Reinhardt, Hedda Sterne, Jimmy Ernst, Bradley Walker Tomlin, and Theodoros Stamos, among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic Robert Coates.Abstract Expressionism, NY, MoMAClement Greenberg, Art and Culture Critical essays, (\\"American-Type Painting\\"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.:208–229, Abstract expressionism, Action painting, and Color Field painting are synonymous with the New York School. Technically Surrealism was an important predecessor for Abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, automatic or subconscious creation. Jackson Pollock's dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of André Masson. Another important early manifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist Mark Tobey, especially his \\"white writing\\" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the \\"all over\\" look of Pollock's drip paintings. Additionally, Abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic \\"action paintings\\", with their \\"busy\\" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque Women series of Willem de Kooning. Woman V is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three- quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, Woman I, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian Meyer Schapiro saw the painting in de Kooning's studio and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; Woman II, Woman III, and Woman IV. During the summer of 1952, spent at East Hampton, de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He finished work on Woman I by November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.NGA.gov.au, National Gallery of Australia The Woman series are decidedly figurative paintings. Another important artist is Franz Kline, as demonstrated by his painting High Street (1950), who was labelled an action painter because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas. Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Adolph Gottlieb, and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in Mark Rothko's work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what Clement Greenberg termed the Color field direction of abstract expressionism. Both Hans Hofmann and Robert Motherwell can be described as practitioners of action painting and Color field painting. During the 1950s Color Field painting initially referred to a particular type of abstract expressionism, especially the work of Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Robert Motherwell and Adolph Gottlieb. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. Art critic Clement Greenberg perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early-to-mid-1960s Color Field painting came to refer to the styles of artists like Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, and Helen Frankenthaler, whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like Larry Zox, and Frank Stella – all moving in a new direction. =Realism, Landscape, Seascape, Figuration, Still-Life, Cityscape= File:Bellows George Dempsey and Firpo 1924.jpgGeorge Bellows, 1924, American realism File:Nighthawks by Edward Hopper 1942.jpgEdward Hopper, Nighthawks, 1942, Cityscape Georgia O'Keeffe, 1935, Southwestern modernism During the 1930s through the 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as abstract expressionism, Color Field painting, Post-painterly Abstraction, Op art, hard- edge painting, Minimal art, shaped canvas painting, and Lyrical Abstraction. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction allowing imagery to continue through various new contexts like the Bay Area Figurative Movement in the 1950s and new forms of expressionism from the 1940s through the 1960s. Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced Realism and used expressive imagery in landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects. They include artists as varied as Milton Avery, John D. Graham, Fairfield Porter, Edward Hopper, Andrew Wyeth, Balthus, Francis Bacon, Frank Auerbach, Lucian Freud, Leon Kossoff, Philip Pearlstein, Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, Grace Hartigan, Robert De Niro, Sr., and Elaine de Kooning. In Italy during this time, Giorgio Morandi was the foremost still- life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.David Piper, p. 635 Frida Kahlo, 1940, Latin American Symbolism Arshile Gorky's portrait of Willem de Kooning is an example of the evolution of abstract expressionism from the context of figure painting, cubism and surrealism. Along with his friends de Kooning and John D. Graham Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.Kerr, Melissa (2009). \\"Chronology\\", in: Michael R. Taylor (ed.), Arshile Gorky: A Retrospective. Philadelphia, Pa.: Philadelphia Museum of Art. Barnes, Rachel (2003). Abstract Expressionists. Chicago: Heinemann Library. Study after Velázquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X, 1953 is a painting by the Irish-born artist Francis Bacon and is an example of Post World War II European Expressionism. The work shows a distorted version of the Portrait of Innocent X painted by the Spanish artist Diego Velázquez in 1650. The work is one of a series of variants of the Velázquez painting which Bacon executed throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, over a total of forty-five works.Schmied, Wieland (1996). Francis Bacon: Commitment and Conflict. (Munich) Prestel. , p. 17 When asked why he was compelled to revisit the subject so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against the Popes, that he merely \\"wanted an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of false fauve manner.\\"Peppiatt, Michael, Anatomy of an Enigma. Westview Press. (1996), p. 147 The Pope in this version seethes with anger and aggression, and the dark colors give the image a grotesque and nightmarish appearance.Schmied (1996), p. 20 The pleated curtains of the backdrop are rendered transparent, and seem to fall through the Pope's face.Peppiatt (1996), p. 148 The figurative work of Francis Bacon, Frida Kahlo, Edward Hopper, Lucian Freud, Andrew Wyeth and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism. Nighthawks (1942) is a realist painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown diner late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work. One of the most well-known images in 20th-century American art is Wyeth's tempera painting, Christina's World, in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. It depicts a woman lying on the ground in a treeless, mostly tawny field, looking up at and crawling towards a gray house on the horizon; a barn and various other small outbuildings are adjacent to the house.Christina's World in the MoMA Online Collection After World War II the term School of Paris often referred to Tachisme, the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to Cobra. Important proponents being Jean Dubuffet, Pierre Soulages, Nicolas de Staël, Hans Hartung, Serge Poliakoff, and Georges Mathieu, among several others. During the early 1950s Dubuffet (who was always a figurative artist) and de Staël abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Staël's return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American Bay Area Figurative Movement, as many of those abstract painters like Richard Diebenkorn, David Park, Elmer Bischoff, Wayne Thiebaud, Nathan Oliveira, Joan Brown and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Staël's late work – in particular his abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s – predicts Color Field painting and Lyrical Abstraction of the 1960s and 1970s. Milton Avery as well through his use of color and his interest in seascape and landscape paintings connected with the Color field aspect of Abstract expressionism as manifested by Adolph Gottlieb and Mark Rothko as well as the lessons American painters took from the work of Henri Matisse. =Pop art= Pop art in America was to a large degree initially inspired by the works of Jasper Johns, Larry Rivers, and Robert Rauschenberg, although the paintings of Gerald Murphy, Stuart Davis and Charles Demuth during the 1920s and 1930s foreshadow the style and subject matter of Pop art. In New York City during the mid-1950s, Rauschenberg and Johns created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of Abstract expressionist painting. Actually their works, and the work of Larry Rivers, were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion of mundane materials into their work. Johns' use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the American Flag; Rivers' paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as George Washington crossing the Delaware, and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from Camel cigarettes; and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and taxidermy, gave rise to a radical new movement in American art. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as Pop art. Pop art is exemplified by the artists Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Wayne Thiebaud, James Rosenquist, Jim Dine, Tom Wesselmann and Roy Lichtenstein among others. Lichtenstein used oil and Magna paint in works such as Drowning Girl (1963; Museum of Modern Art, New York), which was appropriated from the lead story in DC Comics' Secret Hearts #83.) Thick outlines, bold colors and Ben-Day dots reproduce the appearance of commercial printing. Lichtenstein would say of his own work: Abstract Expressionists \\"put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's.\\" Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art, while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery and content into the mix. In October 1962 the Sidney Janis Gallery mounted The New Realists, the first major Pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. The show sent shockwaves through the New York School and reverberated worldwide. Campbell's Soup Cans (sometimes referred to as 32 Campbell's Soup Cans) is the title of an Andy Warhol work of art that was produced in 1962. It consists of thirty-two canvases of equal size, each consisting of a painting of a Campbell's Soup can—one of each canned soup variety the company offered at the time. The individual paintings were produced with a semi-mechanised silkscreen process, using a non-painterly style. They helped usher in Pop art as a major art movement that relied on themes from popular culture. Earlier in England in 1956 the term Pop Art was used by Lawrence Alloway for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected Abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age.Topics in American Art since 1945, Pop art the words, pp. 119–122, by Lawrence Alloway, copyright 1975 by W. W. Norton and Company, NYC The early works of English artist David Hockney, such as A Bigger Splash, and the works of Richard Hamilton, Peter Blake, and Eduardo Paolozzi, are considered seminal examples in the movement. In New York's East Village 10th Street galleries artists were formulating an American version of Pop art. Claes Oldenburg had his storefront, and the Green Gallery on 57th Street began to show Tom Wesselmann and James Rosenquist. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and Man Ray, the rebellious Dadaists – with a sense of humor; and Pop Artists like Alex Katz, Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and the others. =Art Brut, New Realism, Bay Area Figurative Movement, Neo-Dada, Photorealism= During the 1950s and 1960s as abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as Color Field painting, Post painterly abstraction, Op art, hard-edge painting, Minimal art, shaped canvas painting, Lyrical Abstraction, and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction with Art brut,Jean Dubuffet: L’Art brut préféré aux arts culturels [1949] Art brut. Madness and Marginalia, special issue of Art & Text, No. 27, 1987, pp. 31–33) as seen in Court les rues, 1962, by Jean Dubuffet, Fluxus, Neo-Dada, New Realism, Photorealism, allowing imagery to re-emerge through various new contexts like Pop art, the Bay Area Figurative Movement (a prime example is Diebenkorn's Cityscape I,(Landscape No. 1) (1963), and later in the 1970s Neo-expressionism. The Bay Area Figurative Movement of whom David Park, Elmer Bischoff, Nathan Oliveira and Richard Diebenkorn whose painting Cityscape 1 (1963) is a typical example, were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in California. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. Yves Klein, Arman, Martial Raysse, Christo, Niki de Saint Phalle, David Hockney, Alex Katz, Malcolm Morley, Ralph Goings, Audrey Flack, Richard Estes, Chuck Close, Susan Rothenberg, Eric Fischl, and Vija Celmins were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. Fairfield Porter was largely self- taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the Abstract Expressionist movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists. Also during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against painting. Critics like Douglas Crimp viewed the work of artists like Ad Reinhardt, and declared the \\"death of painting\\". Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: Fluxus, Happening, Video art, Installation art Mail art, the situationists, Conceptual art, Postminimalism, Earth art, arte povera, performance art and body art among others.Douglas Crimp, The End of Painting, October, Vol. 16, Spring, 1981, pp. 69–86Douglas Crimp, On the Museum's Ruins, Cambridge, Mass., 1993 Neo-Dada is also a movement that started in the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. This trend, in which manufactured items are combined with artist materials, is exemplified by the work of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. Rauschenberg's \\"combines\\" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and Installation art, and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. Rauschenberg, Johns, Larry Rivers, John Chamberlain, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Jim Dine, and Edward Kienholz among others created new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.Catherine Craft, An Audience of Artists: Dada, Neo-Dada, and the Emergence of Abstract Expressionism, University of Chicago, 2012Susan Hapgood, Neo-Dada: Redefining Art, 1958–62, Universe Books and American Federation of Arts, 1994 =Geometric abstraction, Op Art, Hard-Edge, Color field, Minimal Art, New Realism= File:IKB 191.jpgYves Klein, 1962, New Realism During the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. Geometric abstraction, Op art, hard-edge painting, Color Field painting and minimal painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. Morris Louis was an important pioneer in advanced Colorfield painting, his work can serve as a bridge between Abstract expressionism, Colorfield painting, and Minimal Art. Two influential teachers, Josef Albers and Hans Hofmann, introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. Albers is best remembered for his work as a Geometric abstractionist painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series Homage to the Square. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas. Albers' theories on art and education were formative for the next generation of artists. His own paintings form the foundation of both hard-edge painting and Op art. Josef Albers, Hans Hofmann, Ilya Bolotowsky, Burgoyne Diller, Victor Vasarely, Bridget Riley, Richard Anuszkiewicz, Frank Stella, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland,Terry Fenton, online essay about Kenneth Noland, and acrylic paint, Sharecom.ca, accessed 30 April 2007 Ellsworth Kelly, John McLaughlin, Barnett Newman, Larry Poons, Ronald Davis, John Hoyland, Larry Zox, Al Held, Mino Argento are artists closely associated with Geometric abstraction, Op art, Color Field painting, and in the case of Hofmann and Newman Abstract expressionism as well. Agnes Martin, Robert Mangold, Brice Marden, Jo Baer, Robert Ryman, Richard Tuttle, Neil Williams, David Novros, Paul Mogenson, are examples of artists associated with Minimalism and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the shaped canvas also during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many Geometric abstract artists, minimalists, and Hard-edge painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the shaped canvas is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly abstract, formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or minimalist in character. The Bykert Gallery, and the Park Place Gallery were important showcases for Minimalism and shaped canvas painting in New York City during the 1960s. =Shaped canvas, Washington Color School, Abstract Illusionism, Lyrical Abstraction= Ronnie Landfield, 1971, Lyrical Abstraction Color Field painting pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from abstract expressionism. Related to Post- painterly abstraction, Suprematism, Abstract Expressionism, Hard-edge painting and Lyrical Abstraction, Color Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, Hans Hofmann, Morris Louis, Jules Olitski, Kenneth Noland, Helen Frankenthaler, Larry Zox, and others painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists made references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of modern art, artists wanted to present each painting as one cohesive, monolithic image. Gene Davis along with Kenneth Noland, Morris Louis and several others was a member of the Washington Color School painters who began to create Color Field paintings in Washington, D.C. during the 1950s and 1960s, Black, Grey, Beat is a large vertical stripe painting and typical of Gene Davis's work. Frank Stella, Kenneth Noland, Ellsworth Kelly, Barnett Newman, Ronald Davis, Neil Williams, Robert Mangold, Charles Hinman, Richard Tuttle, David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the shaped canvas during the period beginning in the early 1960s. From 1960 Frank Stella produced paintings in aluminum and copper paint and his first works using shaped canvases (canvases in a shape other than the traditional rectangle or square), often being in L, N, U or T-shapes. These later developed into more elaborate designs, in the Irregular Polygon series (1967), for example. Later he began his Protractor Series (1971) of paintings, in which arcs, sometimes overlapping, within square borders are arranged side-by-side to produce full and half circles painted in rings of concentric color. Harran II, 1967, is an example of the Protractor Series. The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the Leo Castelli Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the Park Place Gallery were important showcases for Color Field painting, shaped canvas painting and Lyrical Abstraction in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with post-painterly abstraction, which reacted against abstract expressionisms' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible – as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and Minimal art were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse. Lyrical Abstraction (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.Aldrich, Larry. Young Lyrical Painters, Art in America, v.57, n6, November–December 1969, pp. 104–113. It is also the name of an exhibition that originated in the Aldrich Museum and traveled to the Whitney Museum of American Art and other museums throughout the United States between 1969 and 1971.Lyrical Abstraction, Exhibition Catalogue, the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Ridgefield, Connecticut 1970. Lyrical Abstraction is a type of freewheeling abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general.The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, Lyrical Abstraction, exhibition: 5 April through 7 June 1970Lyrical Abstraction Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 25 May – 6 July 1971 In contrast to Action Painting, where emphasis is on brushstrokes and high compositional drama, in Lyrical Abstraction—as exemplified by the 1971 Ronnie Landfield painting Garden of Delight—there is a sense of compositional randomness, relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility. Lyrical Abstraction in the late 1960s is characterized by the paintings of Dan Christensen, Ronnie Landfield, Peter Young and others, and along with the Fluxus movement and Postminimalism (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of Artforum in 1969)Movers and Shakers, New York, \\"Leaving C&M;\\", by Sarah Douglas, Art and Auction, March 2007, V.XXXNo7. sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. Postminimalism often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to Dada and Surrealism is best exemplified in the sculptures of Eva Hesse. Lyrical Abstraction, Conceptual Art, Postminimalism, Earth Art, Video, Performance art, Installation art, along with the continuation of Fluxus, Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, Hard-edge painting, Minimal Art, Op art, Pop art, Photorealism and New Realism extended the boundaries of Contemporary Art in the mid-1960s through the 1970s.Martin, Ann Ray, and Howard Junker. The New Art: It's Way, Way Out, Newsweek 29 July 1968: pp. 3, 55–63. =Abstract Illusionism, Monochrome, Minimalism, Postminimalism= File:'Red Canvas' by Richard Tuttle, 1967, Corcoran Gallery of Art.jpgRichard Tuttle, 1967, Postminimalism File:The Dylan Painting.jpgBrice Marden, 1966/1986, Monochrome painting Ronald Davis, Ring, 1968, Abstract Illusionism One of the first artists specifically associated with Minimalism was Frank Stella, whose early \\"stripe\\" paintings were highlighted in the 1959 show, \\"16 Americans\\", organized by Dorothy Miller at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The widths of the stripes in Stella's stripe paintings were not entirely subjective, but were determined by the dimensions of the lumber used to construct the supportive chassis upon which the canvas was stretched. In the show catalog, Carl Andre noted, \\"Art excludes the unnecessary. Frank Stella has found it necessary to paint stripes. There is nothing else in his painting.\\" These reductive works were in sharp contrast to the energy-filled and apparently emotionally charged paintings of Willem de Kooning or Franz Kline and leaned more toward less gestural coloristic field paintings of Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko. Artists such as Larry Poons—whose work related to Op Art with his emphasis on dots, ovals and after-images bouncing across color fields—Kenneth Noland, Ralph Humphrey, Robert Motherwell and Robert Ryman had also begun to explore stripes, monochromatic and Hard-edge formats from the late 1950s through the 1960s.Britannica.com, \\"Minimalism\\" Because of a tendency in Minimalism to exclude the pictorial, illusionistic and fictive in favor of the literal—as demonstrated by Robert Mangold, who understood the concept of the shape of the canvas and its relationship to objecthood—there was a movement away from painterly and toward sculptural concerns. Donald Judd had started as a painter, and ended as a creator of objects. His seminal essay, \\"Specific Objects\\" (published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), was a touchstone of theory for the formation of Minimalist aesthetics. In this essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values. He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including Jasper Johns, Dan Flavin and Lee Bontecou. Of \\"preliminary\\" importance for Judd was the work of George Earl Ortman , who had concretized and distilled painting's forms into blunt, tough, philosophically charged geometries. These Specific Objects inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd. In a much more general sense, one might find European roots of Minimalism in the geometric abstractions painters in the Bauhaus, in the works of Piet Mondrian and other artists associated with the movement DeStijl, in Russian Constructivists and in the work of the Romanian sculptor Constantin Brâncuși. American painters such as Brice Marden and Cy Twombly show a clear European influence in their pure abstraction, minimalist painting of the 1960s. Ronald Davis polyurethane works from the late 1960s pay homage to the Broken Glass of Marcel Duchamp. This movement was heavily criticised by high modernist formalist art critics and historians. Some anxious critics thought Minimalist art represented a misunderstanding of the modern dialectic of painting and sculpture as defined by critic Clement Greenberg, arguably the dominant American critic of painting in the period leading up to the 1960s. The most notable critique of Minimalism was produced by Michael Fried, a Greenbergian critic, who objected to the work on the basis of its \\"theatricality\\". In Art and Objecthood (published in Artforum in June 1967) he declared that the Minimalist work of art, particularly Minimalist sculpture, was based on an engagement with the physicality of the spectator. He argued that work like Robert Morris's transformed the act of viewing into a type of spectacle, in which the artifice of the act observation and the viewer's participation in the work were unveiled. Fried saw this displacement of the viewer's experience from an aesthetic engagement within, to an event outside of the artwork as a failure of Minimal art. Ad Reinhardt, actually an artist of the Abstract Expressionist generation, but one whose reductive all- black paintings seemed to anticipate minimalism, had this to say about the value of a reductive approach to art: \\"The more stuff in it, the busier the work of art, the worse it is. More is less. Less is more. The eye is a menace to clear sight. The laying bare of oneself is obscene. Art begins with the getting rid of nature.\\"Less Is More: Ad Reinhardt's 12 Rules for Pure Art, The Editors of ARTnews, 24 January 2015 (based on a paper read at the 45th annual meeting of the College Art Association at the Detroit Institute of Art, 26 January 1957) During the 1960s and 1970s artists as powerful and influential as Adolph Gottlieb, Phillip Guston, Lee Krasner, Richard Diebenkorn, Elmer Bischoff, Agnes Martin, Sam Francis, Gene Davis, Joan Mitchell, Friedel Dzubas, and younger artists like Sam Gilliam, Sean Scully, Pat Steir, Elizabeth Murray, Walter Darby Bannard, Dan Christensen, Joan Snyder, Richard Tuttle, Ross Bleckner, Archie Rand, Susan Crile, and dozens of others produced vital and influential paintings. Still other important innovations in abstract painting took place during the 1960s and the 1970s characterized by Monochrome painting and Hard-edge painting inspired by Ad Reinhardt, Barnett Newman, Milton Resnick, and Ellsworth Kelly. Artists as diversified as Al Held, Larry Zox, Frank Stella, Larry Poons, Brice Marden and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of Color Field painting, Minimal art, Hard- edge painting, Lyrical Abstraction, and Postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The Neo- expressionism movement is related to earlier developments in Abstract expressionism, Neo-Dada, Lyrical Abstraction and Postminimal painting. =Neo-expressionism= In the late 1960s the abstract expressionist painter Philip Guston helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to Neo-expressionism in painting, abandoning the so-called \\"pure abstraction\\" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery.Neo- Expressionism, The Art Story His painting Painting, Smoking, Eating is an example of Guston's return to representation. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and Britain. These movements were called Transavantguardia, Neue Wilde, Figuration Libre, Neo-expressionism, the school of London, and in the late 80s the Stuckists respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination. All work in this genre came to be labeled neo-expressionism. Neo-expressionism was a style of modern painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and minimalistic art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner) in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colors and banal color harmonies. The veteran painters Philip Guston, Frank Auerbach, Leon Kossoff, Gerhard Richter, A. R. Penck and Georg Baselitz, along with the slightly younger artists Damien Hirst, Anselm Kiefer, the Americans Eric Fischl, Susan Rothenberg, David Salle, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Julian Schnabel, and Keith Haring, the Italians Francesco Clemente, Mimmo Paladino, Sandro Chia, and Enzo Cucchi, and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries. Anselm Kiefer is a leading figure in European Neo-expressionism.The Art Story, Artist Anselm Kiefer By the 1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on Germany's role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involves not only national identity and collective memory, but also occult symbolism, theology and mysticism.Fiefer, Tate The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life. Painting still holds a respected position in contemporary art. Art is an open field no longer divided by the objective versus non-objective dichotomy. Artists can achieve critical success whether their images are representational or abstract. What has currency is content, exploring the boundaries of the medium, and a refusal to recapitulate the works of the past as an end goal.Jan Esmann, F. Scott Hess, 21st Century Figurative Art: The Resurrection of Art, BookBaby Print, Nov 5, 2016, Timothy Hyman, The World New Made: Figurative Painting in the Twentieth Century, Thames & Hudson, 2016, Ronald Paulson, Figure and abstraction in contemporary painting, Rutgers University Press, 1990 Damien Hirst, 2003 Contemporary painting into the 21st century Throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century, with the advent of Modern and Postmodern art forms, distinctions between what is generally regarded as the fine arts and the low arts have started to fade, as contemporary high art continues to challenge these concepts by mixing with popular culture. Mainstream painting has been rejected by artists of the postmodern era in favor of artistic pluralism.About Contemporary Art, Getty Museum According to art critic Arthur Danto there is an anything goes attitude that prevails; an \\"everything going on\\", and consequently \\"nothing going on\\" syndrome; this creates an aesthetic traffic jam with no firm and clear direction and with every lane on the artistic superhighway filled to capacity. As quoted by Professor David W. Cloweny on his website.

It comprises the five tracks from Celestiial's demo, Ashen, combined with three more tracks recorded separately. It was written, performed and recorded entirely by Tanner Anderson, the member of Celestiial, and was never written to be an album or to be performed. The Bindrune CD release is out-of-print, but Desolate North is still available digitally and in LP-format, the latter having been released by music distributor Handmade Birds in 2011. The album received mixed reviews--some critics claimed it was fresh and a new sound, while others argued it was very similar to music already available. Desolate North has an extremely slow rhythm and has only limited vocals. The music is interspersed with various woodland sounds, such as running water and footsteps. The natural imagery used on the album is reminiscent of that used in black metal, but the music is closer to ambient. Recording The album was recorded in three parts. First, Anderson recorded the music for Ashen. This was done in a wooden loft in the corner of the rehearsal space used by Azrael, of whom Anderson was, at the time, a member. Anderson has said that he does not remember how long this recording took him, as he slept there after finishing the work. He described that space as perfect for the recording, as there was nothing there to distract him. As the entire album was recorded and played by Anderson, the only option was to record the music in layers. First, he recorded the drums, using a drum kit. However, he was unhappy with the way they sounded, and so re-recorded on a drum machine. The next layers to be recorded were the guitar, bass and vocals, with other sounds being added later. The other three songs on Desolate North one was recorded at the same place in early 2005, and the other two, the harp pieces, were recorded at Anderson's home. He has said how this was the most difficult part of the recording. As it happened, Anderson misplaced his microphone stand and so recorded those two songs with the microphone tucked under his chin. Despite the hindrance, Anderson claimed that the microphone picked up everything, and he was happy with the result. Anderson has described the process as giving the album a \\"raw\\" sound, and he has hypothesized that it is because of the raw sound of the album that critics have described his work as having influences from black metal. Although the album's production was criticised by Ignacio Coluccio of Maelstrom, Kim Kelly, of Pivotal Alliance, praised the album for its high quality recording, explaining that it \\"is not raw, necro black metal at all\\". Release A small number of copies of Ashen were sent to various people. Marty Rytkonen, of Bindrune Recordings, was the only person attached to a record label to receive one, and Celestiial was then taken on by Bindrune. Anderson was very happy with this, as he had been an avid reader of Worm Gear (a magazine attached to the label) when he was younger. Despite the fact that Anderson had not written Desolate North with the intention of it ever being released, in 2006, it was released by Bindrune Recordings. The CD version released by Bindrune Recordings is now out of print. However, in 2011, the album was rereleased in vinyl LP format by Handmade Birds, and the album remains available in digital format. Musical style Desolate North has been described as taking \\"the template of the funeral doom genre... and disembowel[ing] the formula even further\\". The album makes use of minimal vocals, instead relying on electronics, guitars, and syncopated drums (with liberal use of cymbals). These sounds are also backed up by more traditional instruments, such as harps and Native American flutes. Additionally, sampled sounds—including footsteps, water, birdsong and wind—are used. Celestiial is a funeral doom metal band. However, Desolate North has been described as taking the genre in new directions with comparisons to ambient, goth, experimental, and dark folk music being made. The music has also been described as meditative and medieval. Anderson admits that there may be death metal influences in the vocals, but says that it was not a conscious design, and that the music does not have any other similarities to death metal. He claims that there are no black metal influences. He says that describing Celestiial's music as folk is a bad idea, as folk is such a broad, vague description as to make it meaningless. He says that what he is creating is neither folk, nor traditional, and even the harp songs are not traditional works, though they are influenced by the traditional music of the United Kingdom and traditional Irish music. Imagery A publicity photo used by the band. It shows Anderson holding a piece of bark, demonstrating the band's heavy use of natural imagery. Desolate North uses imagery very much based around nature, with natural sounds sampled in the music, and imagery involving woodland, and, as one reviewer put it, \\"the scary places that we all fear when the lights are out\\". Bindrune recordings describes this affinity for nature by saying that \\"Celestiial was created to mirror mysticism in nature.\\" Brandon Stosuy, of Pitchfork Media, talked of a black metal influence in the album's imagery. Anderson responded to the claim of black metal influence by stating that he does not know why people compare his music to black metal; he hypothesized that it is simply the raw production of the music, or the double 'i' in the band name. Anderson was once asked about whether there were any pagan beliefs in Celestiial. He responded that Celestiial \\"is romanticized Paganism with very real Pagan values behind it\\". He talked of how Celestiial celebrated paganism and the natural world, but that paganism is often viewed as something that it is not. Reception Desolate North received mixed reviews. The album garnered positive reviews from a number of ezines, with comparisons to founders of the genre, such as Disembowelment. AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia, however, felt that Desolate North compared negatively with the efforts of more prominent bands, concluding that \\"Celestiial could be a hell of a lot worse, but they could be much better, too.\\" Scott Seward of Decibel Magazine felt that the music compared well to similar bands, said that Anderson \\"makes beautiful sounds out of the darkness that others would rather run from\\". Reviewers disagreed on the originality of the music--while Seward claimed that it was new and inventive, Murat Batmaz, of Maelstrom, said that it was very typical funeral doom metal. Negative reviews and comments talked about the poor production and guitars, and the lack of speed in the music, combined with the monotony of the sound. Seward felt that the album \\"is not 'heavy' music in the least, if we’re talking volume and crunch\\", but that \\"it is 'heavy' music if we’re talking about the end product: a deep and pervasively creepy atmosphere that is compelling in its use of silence and hushed reverence for the forest floor\\".

The designer's innovative and experimental work helped shape the vocabulary of 20th-century graphic design. Biography Born in Engelberg, Switzerland, Matter studied painting at the and at the Académie Moderne in Paris under the tutalge of Fernand Léger and Amédée Ozenfant. He worked with Adolphe Mouron Cassandre, Le Corbusier and Deberny & Peignot. In 1932, he returned to Zurich, where he designed posters for the Swiss National Tourist Office and Swiss resorts. The travel posters won instant international acclaim for his pioneering use of photomontage combined with typeface. He went to the United States in 1936 and was hired by legendary art director Alexey Brodovitch. Work for Harper's Bazaar, Vogue and other magazines followed. In the 1940s, photographers, including Irving Penn, at Vogues studios at 480 Lexington Avenue often used them for shooting the advertising work commissioned by outside clients. The practice was at first tolerated but by 1950 it was banned on the grounds that it \\"has interfered with our own interests and has been a severe handicap to our editorial operations\\".In-house magazine Condé Nast Ink, August 1950, p. 3 In response Matter and three other Condé Nast photographers Serge Balkin, Constantin Joffé and Geoffrey Baker left to establish Studio Enterprises Inc. in the former House & Garden studio on 37th Street (Penn stayed on but also left in 1952).Penn, Irving; Maria Morris Hambourg and Jeff Rosenheim and Alexandra Dennett (writers of supplementary textual content); Grand Palais, Paris (host institution). Irving Penn : Centennial. Metropolitan Museum of Art (2017), p. 324, From 1946 to 1966 Matter was design consultant with Knoll Associates. He worked closely with Charles and Ray Eames. From 1952 to 1976 he was professor of photography at Yale University and from 1958 to 1968 he served as design consultant to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. He was elected to the New York Art Director's Club Hall of Fame in 1977, received a Guggenheim Fellowship in photography in 1980 and the AIGA medal in 1983. As a photographer, Matter won acclaim for his purely visual approach. A master technician, he used every method available to achieve his vision of light, form and texture. Manipulation of the negative, retouching, cropping, enlarging and light drawing are some of the techniques he used to achieve the fresh form he sought in his still lifes, landscapes, nudes and portraits. As a filmmaker, he directed two films on his friend Alexander Calder: \\"Sculptures and Constructions\\" in 1944 and \\"Works of Calder\\" (with music by John Cage) for the Museum of Modern Art in 1950. Close friends of Matter and his wife Mercedes were the painters Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, fellow Swiss photographer Robert Frank and Alberto Giacometti. Matter's wife Mercedes was the daughter of the American modernist painter Arthur Beecher Carles, and was herself the chief founder of the New York Studio School. \\"The absence of pomposity was characteristic of this guy\\", said another designer, Paul Rand, about Matter. His creative life was devoted to narrowing the gap between so- called fine and applied arts. Matter died on May 8, 1984, in Southampton, New York.The Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz gives Springs, East Hampton, New York, as his place of death.

The school opened in 1961. History Wahconah was a Mahican Indian Princess who the elders wanted to marry a Mohawk warrior. She, however, loved an Algonquian warrior named Nessacus, who risked his life to save her from a bear attack. The matter was to be decided by fate, whereby her canoe would drift to either man standing on opposite banks of the river. However, Wahconah rigged the boat so that it would go toward Nessacus, and they were married. The Building was built shortly after the creation of the district, and was finished by the start of the 1961 school year. It was originally built to hold about 650 students. During the boom of GE Plastics in Pittsfield, enrollment was as high as 1,300. Accordingly the building has undergone some expansion, including two portable classrooms and the addition of five classrooms onto one of its corridors.  Campus  Wahconah sits on of land off Route 8 in Dalton. The building is shaped like a ladder, with two main corridors that run North- South, and three hallways that run East-West. Expansion plans originally called for the addition of a fourth hallway connecting the ends of the hallways, but it proved to be too expensive. There are also soccer fields, baseball diamonds, and a track/football field. It is one of the few high schools in the region to have both JV and varsity baseball fields on its campus. Trails that run through the woods are used by track and field and cross country running, as well as connect the school to Nessacus Regional Middle School. On April 6, 2019, the citizens of the seven towns that are serviced by the Central Berkshire School District narrowly approved the $70 million dollar project to build a new Wahconah High by 88 votes (1,785 votes in favor and 1,697 against).

Business courses and tech classes are also offered. In the 2006-2007 school year, Wahconah became part of VHS, in which schools provide a teacher to teach online courses in exchange for the ability for 25 students to take other online classes.  Extracurricular activities  Wahconah is well-known across Berkshire County for its highly competitive and successful athletic teams. All of its major sports (Football, Baseball, Track & Field, and Soccer) have held numerous county titles. Furthermore, it also is building strong Swimming and Lacrosse programs.

WFMG broadcasts at an effective radiated power of 25,000 watts with its studios, offices, and tower located on West Main Street in Richmond. History WFMG started broadcasting on December 17, 1960 as WKBV-FM at 106.5 MHz. WKBV-FM featured a Beautiful music format throughout its duration. WKBV- FM moved to 101.3 MHz in the early 1960s. In 1976, the station dropped beautiful music in favor of a middle-of-the-road Adult Contemporary format as WRIA, meaning \\"W Richmond Indiana Area\\". The station eventually segued into what would today be considered Hot Adult Contemporary by the early and mid 80s. \\"FM 101\\" went to a soft rock format in 1986. The calls changed to WFMG and the station became known on the air as \\"Magic 101...Lite Rock, Less Talk.\\" This format continued until the late 80s when cross-town station WQLK dropped its Top 40 format in favor of Classic Hits. \\"Magic 101\\" maximized on this move by adding hotter records to its playlist by 1990. Also added was a nightly countdown show as well as American Top 40. Unlike WQLK, \\"Magic 101\\" did not go full-fledged into the format in order to maintain its presence as an Adult Contemporary station. By 1991, WFMG began adding a couple of weekend Oldies shows to its line-up, which eventually led up to a format change in December 1991. The station became known as \\"Goodtime Oldies 101\\" and eventually just \\"Oldies 101.\\" Unlike many of the Oldies stations of the early 90s, WFMG played a generous amount of 70s Pop and more or less stayed away from 50s Doo-Wop and Pop. The nearly-two year stint was a flop and, as a result, the station dropped the \\"Oldies\\" name and gradually moved back into a contemporary music direction. The transition was complete by 1994 when the station officially became Hot Adult Contemporary \\"Hits 101.3,\\" featuring music of the 80s and 90s. The station remained \\"Hits\\" until the late 90s when the station became \\"G 101-3\\" as a result of an imaging change. Although the format remains Hot AC to this day with Rick Duncan as the Morning Show Host, the G101.3 Morning Show has a program from 7 to 9 called The Free For All Friday allowing listeners to request any song in any format as long as they have it, even Christmas songs in July. Originally they allowed for any tempo song to be requested, a second rule was added stating the songs must be up-tempo as people were requesting slow songs to be played after up-beat songs. Scott Epic does mid-days 10am-3pm. The crazy & young Hoover hosts the afternoon show from 3 pm to 7 pm. News Updates are provided by Joel Brantingham throughout the day, and weather is provided by Dayton affiliate WDTN-TV Channel 2. G1013 is also home to the Miami University RedHawks Football & Basketball teams. Longtime G101-3 personality Dave Snow left the station in 2015 to run for mayor of the city of Richmond, IN. He had a successful campaign. Reception In 2005, WFMG's sister station, WIFE-FM in nearby Connersville, applied to move to Norwood, Ohio, in the Cincinnati radio market. As a result of this move, many stations throughout Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky had to reduce power or change frequencies in order to make the move feasible. Therefore, WFMG had to cut its power in half, from 50,000 watts to 25,000 watts, in order for Radio One's WIZF in Cincinnati to move to 101.1 MHz. Radio One owns WIZF and was the suitor for WIFE-FM. WFMG, being on first-adjacent frequency from 101.1, had to reduce its power in order to prevent interference with WIZF. This severely affected WFMG's reception in the southern Whitewater Valley once WIZF signed on 101.1. Reception in the eastern, western, and northern portions of the coverage area were much less affected. However, this may change as another pending frequency move -- WKSW Urbana into the Dayton metro—may have further impact on the station's reception to the east of Richmond if approved.

It goes back to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bamberg established at the 1007 synod in Frankfurt, at the behest of King Henry II to further expand the spread of Christianity in the Franconian lands. The bishops obtained the status of Imperial immediacy about 1245 and ruled their estates as Prince-bishops until they were subsumed to the Electorate of Bavaria in the course of the German Mediatisation in 1802. State Bamberg Cathedral The Bishops of Bamberg received the princely title by Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen before his deposition by Pope Innocent IV in 1245, whereby the diocese became an Imperial state, covering large parts of the current Bavarian region of Franconia (\\"Main Franconia\\"). Part of the Franconian Circle (territories grouped together within the Holy Roman Empire for defensive purposes) from 1500 onwards, the Bamberg territory was bordered, among others, by the Prince-Bishopric of Würzburg to the west, by the Hohenzollern margraviate of Brandenburg-Ansbach and the Free Imperial City of Nuremberg to the south, by the margraviate of Brandenburg-Bayreuth to the east and by the Wettin duchy of Saxe-Coburg to the north. During the 18th century, it was often held in conjunction with the neighbouring Diocese of Würzburg, whose rulers since 1168 claimed the archaic title of a \\"Duke of Franconia\\". The Prince-bishopric was also vested with large possessions within the Duchy of Carinthia that were strategically important for crossing the Eastern Alps, including the towns of Villach, Feldkirchen, Wolfsberg and Tarvis, located at the trade route to Venice, as well as Kirchdorf an der Krems in the Archduchy of Austria. The Habsburg Empress Maria Theresa purchased these territories in 1759. In the course of the German Mediatisation of 1802/3 which saw the suppression of virtually all the ecclesiastical principalities, Bamberg was annexed to Bavaria. The former prince-bishopric then had an area of 3,580 km² and a population of 207,000.  History =Establishment Beginning on 1 November 1007, a synod was held in the city of Frankfurt am Main. Eight archbishops and twenty-seven bishops were present, led by Archbishop Willigis of Mainz, as well as the Ottonian ruler Henry II, elected King of the Romans in 1002. The king, having suppressed the revolt of Margrave Henry of Schweinfurt in 1003, intended to strengthen his rule and to create a new diocese that would aid in the final conquest of paganism in the Franconian area around Bamberg. Nevertheless, as the territory of the Wends on the upper Main, Wiesent, and Aisch rivers had belonged to the dioceses of Würzburg since the organization of the Middle German bishoprics by St. Boniface, the new bishopric could not be erected without the consent of the occupant of that see. Bishop Henry I of Würzburg was willing to go along with parting with some of his territory, as the king promised to have Würzburg raised to an archbishopric and to give him an equivalent in Meiningen. The consent of Pope John XVII was obtained for this arrangement, however, the elevation of Würzburg to an archbishopric proved impracticable also due to Willigis' reservations, and Bishop Henry I at first withdrew his consent. Nevertheless, after several further concessions, King Henry II obtained the consent for the foundation of the diocese of Bamberg from parts of the dioceses of Würzburg and - later - the Diocese of Eichstätt. Bamberg first was made exempt, i.e. directly subordinate to Rome. It was also decided that Eberhard, the king's chancellor, would be ordained by Archbishop Willigis of Mainz, to be the head of the new border area diocese. The new diocese had expensive gifts at the synod confirmed by documents, in order to place it on a solid foundation. Henry wanted the celebrated monkish rigour and studiousness of the Hildesheim cathedral chapter - Henry himself was educated there - linked together with the churches under his control, including his favourite bishopric of Bamberg. The next seven bishops were appointed by the Holy Roman Emperors, after which election by the cathedral chapter became the rule, as in all the German prince-bishoprics. Eberhard's immediate successor, Suidger of Morsleben, became pope in 1046 as Clement II. He was the only pope to be interred north of the Alps at the Bamberg Cathedral. Bishop Hermann I oversaw the foundation of Banz Abbey in 1070; Bishop Otto of Bamberg (d. 1139) became known as the \\"Apostle of the Pomeranians\\". Imperial state Altenburg, residence of the Bamberg prince-bishops from 1305 to 1553 In the early 13th century, the Bamberg bishops interfered in the German throne dispute between the Welf and Hohenstaufen dynasties: Bishop Ekbert of Andechs, son of Duke Berthold of Merania, was faced with the suspicion of being involved in the murder of Philip of Swabia in 1208 and temporarily had to flee to the Hungarian court of his brother-in-law King Andrew II. His relative Poppo, bishop from 1238, was deposed by the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II in 1242. Emperor Frederick II appointed a local supporter, the Bamberg canon Henry of Bilversheim, bishop. Bishop Henry became the first Prince-bishop; under his rule, the diocese gradually became a territorial principality, and its bishops took secular precedence next after the Mainz archbishops From about 1305, Altenburg Castle was used as a secondary residence. In 1390 Bishop Lamprecht, former chancellor of Emperor Charles V, also acquired the fortress of Giechburg. The early 15th century saw fierce conflicts with Hussite rebels as well as with the Bamberg citizens. Bishop Heinrich Groß von Trockau (d. 1501) entered into several fights with the Hohenzollern prince Casimir of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. Protestant Reformation Bamberg Cathedral with the old and new palaces of the prince-bishops Seehof Castle near Bamberg, summer residence The 39th bishop, Georg Schenk von Limpurg had a procedure for the judgment of capital crimes (Halsgerichtsordnung) drawn up by Johann of Schwarzenberg in 1507, which later became a model for the Constitutio Criminalis Carolina agreed at the 1530 Diet of Augsburg. Bishop Georg, though a confidant of Emperor Maximilian I, was inclined toward the Reformation movement of Martin Luther, which caused a violent social outbreak under his successor Weigand, ruling from 1522 to 1556. Morevover, the city suffered severely in the Second Margrave War (1552–54), when Albert Alcibiades' forces occupied large parts of the bishopric. After the war, the bishop had the Forchheim Fortress erected. From 1609 onwards Prince-Bishop Johann Gottfried von Aschhausen, also elected Bishop of Würzburg in 1617, and his successor Johann Georg Fuchs von Dornheim enacted stern Counter-Reformation measures. Under their rule, Bamberg also became notorious as a centre of witch-hunt in the Holy Roman Empire. Among the numerous victims of the Bamberg witch trials were Dorothea Flock as well as the Bamberg mayor Johannes Junius, which even provoked an intervention by the Diet of Regensburg in 1630. Meanwhile, the Bamberg estates were devastated in the Thirty Years' War. Bishop Johann Georg fled to his remote Carinthian estates in 1631 and his successor Franz von Hatzfeld was likewise expelled, when the Bamberg and Würzburg bishoprics was placed under the jurisdiction of Prince Bernard of Saxe-Weimar, who obtained the title of a \\"Duke of Franconia\\" from the hands of the Swedish chancellor Axel Oxenstierna in 1633. At the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, the prince-bishops recovered their possessions. In 1647 Bishop Melchior Otto Voit von Salzburg established the University of Bamberg (Academia Bambergensis). In the late 17th century his successors had the Baroque summer residence Schloss Seehof erected and a new residence in Bamberg completed according to plans by Leonhard Dientzenhofer. Highly indebted by the burdens of the Seven Years' War, the prince-bishops had to sell the Carinthian estates to their Habsburg allies in 1759. Secularisation During the French Revolutionary Wars, Bamberg was overrun by French troops and the last prince-bishop, Christoph Franz von Buseck, fled to Prague in 1796. Though he once again returned in 1800 and appointed his nephew Georg Karl Ignaz von Fechenbach zu Laudenbach coadjutor, he had to face the occupation by the Bavarian troops of Elector Maximilian IV Joseph in 1802. After Bishop Christoph Franz officially resigned on 29 September 1802, the Bamberg estates and assets, such as the extensive collections of the Banz and Michaelsberg abbeys or the Bamberg treasury with the Reliquary Crown of Henry II, were seized by the Bavarian state. In the course of the German Mediatisation, agreed by the Perpetual Diet of Regensburg on 25 February 1803 (Reichsdeputationshauptschluss), Bamberg was finally annexed to Bavaria. From 1808 to 1817 the See was vacant; but by the Bavarian Concordat of the latter year it was raised to an archbishopric, with Würzburg, Speyer, and Eichstädt as suffragan sees. Bishops of BambergPatronage The prince-bishops operated courts like minor royalty and employed artists, in particular musicians. Kapellmeisters and organists attached to the court included several minor South German masters such as Heinrich Pfendner, Johann Baal, Georg Arnold and Georg Mengel.

Brewing in Český Krumlov dates back to 1336. The House of Rosenberg acquired a brewery in the town in 1522 and relocated it to its current location from 1625–30. After the death of the male inheritors of the House of Rosenberg (1611), in 1622 the dominion was given to the House of Eggenberg and in 1628 Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg was named Duke of Krumau by Ferdinand II. Thus the House of Eggenberg acquired the lucrative dominion including possession of Český Krumlov Castle and the brewery. The Eggenberg's held the dominion in their possession until 1717 when the last male heir to the House of Eggenberg died at only 13, after which the dominion and the Eggenberg Bohemian possessions passed to the House of Schwarzenberg which began modernizing the brewery in 1719 and decorated it in the Baroque style. The brewery's equipment and machinery were kept up to date during the Schwarzenbergs' ownership. Production volumes increased dramatically during this period, reaching almost 35.000hl at the end of the 19th century. Hops from their Postoloprty estate were used from the late 18th century onwards.  Confiscation of the brewery  In 1940, the brewery was seized by Nazi Germany, as were all Adolph Schwarzenberg's other properties within the reach of the Third Reich. Following World War II, the Nazi expropriation was perpetuated by the government of Czechoslovakia under Edvard Beneš. It first declared national administration of Schwarzenberg's Czech properties and then tried to confiscate them under the so-called Beneš decrees. This, however, proved impossible due to the owner's impeccable anti-fascist credentials and Czechoslovak citizenship. In order to prevent the return of the properties, law 143/1947, also known as \\"Lex Schwarzenberg\\", was promulgated in 1947. This law is a unique case of ad hominem legislation. It is directed exclusively at Adolph Schwarzenberg (the two persons additionally named in this law were dead at the time and he was their legal successor), and deprives him of his property rights without justification, explanation or compensation. The application of law 143/1947 remains disputable, because it contravenes the Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920, which was in force at the time of promulgation. Furthermore, an appeal against the previous confiscation under presidential decrees was pending, rendering any additional act null and void.  Privatisation  In September 1991, the brewery was sold in an auction to infamous entrepreneurs Jiří Shrbený and František Mrázek for CSK 75 million. Mr Mrazek was shot dead in 2006 under unclear circumstances. The property was incorporated in their companies Dionex and Eggenberg, which are linked to a number of controversial figures.

After his work on The Secret of Treasure Island, L. Ron Hubbard also helped with the script for the 1941 Columbia movie serial, The Spider Returns. Producer Jack Fier brought in Louis Weiss as associate producer, and hired Elmer Clifton to direct.

Geography It is located in the Industrieviertel region of Lower Austria, about southwest of the Austrian capital Vienna. Alland is situated in a valley of the Vienna Woods (Wienerwald) mountain range and recreation area. The municipal area comprises the village of Mayerling with its hunting lodge, today a Carmelite monastery. The present-day municipality was formed in 1972 by the merger of Alland and Raisenmarkt comprising the cadastral communities of Alland, Glashütten, Groisbach, Innerer Kaltenbergerforst and Äußerer Kaltenbergerforst, Mayerling, Pöllerhof, Raisenmarkt, Rohrbach, Schwechatbach, Weissenweg, and Windhaag. It is the largest municipality in Baden District by area. History Archaeological excavations of Linear Pottery artifacts indicate that the valley had been settled since the Neolithic era. A first church in Alland was erected in the 8th century. Sts George and Margareta parish church In 1002 King Henry II of Germany enfeoffed large estates around Alland (derived from Adel, aristocratic land) up to the Triesting River to the Babenberg margrave Henry I of Austria. The Sts George and Margareta parish church was first mentioned in 1123. In 1133 Margrave Leopold III founded nearby Heiligenkreuz Abbey. Alland remained a possession of the Babenberg rulers after their march was elevated to the Duchy of Austria and the place where the last male heir Frederick I of Austria, son of Gertrude of Babenberg, was born in 1249. Frederick however was not able to assert his claims; he and his friend Conradin of Hohenstaufen were beheaded by order of King Charles I of Naples in 1268. The Babenberg hereditary lands were taken over by King Ottokar II of Bohemia and seized by the Habsburg king Rudolf I of Germany in 1276. The parish was incorporated into Heiligenkreuz Abbey at the behest of Pope Urban VI in 1386. Held by the Lords of Kottingbrunn from 1507, the lands were devastated by Ottoman forces during the 1529 Siege of Vienna and again in the course of the Battle of Vienna in 1683. The Mayerling hunting lodge, a Heiligenkreuz possession since 1550, was acquired by Archduke Rudolf of Austria, the heir to the Austro- Hungarian crown, in 1886. Three years later it saw the Mayerling Incident occur, when Rudolf and his beloved killed themselves here. Immediately afterwards Rudolf's father Emperor Franz Joseph ordered the conversion of the hunting lodge into a monastery which he committed to Carmelite nuns to pray for his son's salvation. Since the fin de siècle, Alland has been converted to a tourist resort and a spa town that is a favorite of the nearby Vienna residents. After the Anschluss annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, the Mayerling monastery was dissolved, the nuns expelled, and the premises turned into a forced labour camp in connection with the construction of the nearby Reichsautobahn. In the late days of World War II the Alland area saw heavy fighting between the I SS Panzer Corps under the command of General Josef Dietrich and Red Army forces of the 6th Guards Tank Army under Marshal Fyodor Tolbukhin from 4 to 22 April 1945. After the war, the demolished Mayerling monastery was restored to the Carmelites and the destroyed buildings were reconstructed. In the 1950s and 60s Alland regained its status as a popular destination for daytrippers and commuters from and to Vienna. The municipality was elevated to a market town in 2002.

While the Kakizaki clan at this date exerted suzerainty over the lords of the local on the Oshima Peninsula, they were themselves subordinate to the Andō clan of Tōhoku; moreover, their authority was limited to the Japanese inhabitants of the , rather than encompassing also the Ainu with whom they traded. After Toyotomi Hideyoshi defeated the Hōjō at Odawara in 1590, and took measures to check the power of the great clans of the north, Yoshihiro travelled to Kyōto, where in the twelfth month of that year he enjoyed an audience with the kampaku at the Jurakudai palace. Reporting on the state of affairs in Ezo, Yoshiro declined a grant of five thousand koku, but had bestowed upon him Junior Fifth Court Rank, Lower Grade and the office of or Senior Vice Minister in the Ministry of Popular Affairs, thus gaining independence from the Andō. Receiving from Hideyoshi also three gorgeous costumes and two hundred ryō of silver, he departed again for the north, reaching the Oshima Peninsula in the third month of 1591. Later that year, Yoshihiro sent troops to help suppress the Kunohe Rebellion, the arrows of the contingent of Ainu seeing mention in for their remarkable quality of dealing death even upon the lightly injured. In the eleventh month of the first year of Bunroku (1592), Yoshihiro travelled to Ōsaka, but Hideyoshi was at Hizen Nagoya, in relation to the invasion of Korea; reaching his camp in Kyūshū, as recorded in Shinra no Kiroku, on the second day of the new year Yoshihiro enjoyed another audience with Hideyoshi, where the two discussed Ezo and the invasion.

The station broadcasts with an ERP of 70 kW. Under ownership of Saga Communications, the station's studios are located in Charleston (east of the Cooper River) and the transmitter tower is in Mount Pleasant. History 99.7 signed on the air July 15, 1988 as WHTK. The station at the time was licensed to Port Royal, with studios located near the town of Bluffton under the ownership of Barnicle Broadcasting. WHTK featured a CHR format targeting nearby Hilton Head and Savannah. Although ratings were very good in its home market of Hilton Head/Beaufort, SC, the station faced stiff competition from competitor WZAT in the Savannah market as well as a weak signal in that area. WHTK played a major role during Hurricane Hugo in 1989 as it was one of the few radio stations that was able to stay on the air for most of the storm and broadcast information to the Lowcountry. In January 1993, the station dropped its CHR format for Country under the new call letters of WNCK as \\"K99.7\\". This lasted less than a year before the station changed formats again to Adult Standards as WLOW moved down the dial from WUBB106.9}} to 99.7. WLOW eventually moved to 107.9 within a year's time and 99.7 once again became WNCK with a Talk format. It eventually gave way to a Contemporary Christian format before going dark in May, 1995. By the Summer of 1995, the station was sold to Baker Broadcasting, who changed the format to a syndicated Beach Music format under the WHBZ call letters as \\"The Breeze\\", pairing it with WWBZ in McClellanville, South Carolina and adding WLXC in Columbia, South Carolina in early 1996. By 2001, Baker Broadcasting sold WHBZ to Apex Broadcasting, which dropped the simulcast with WWBZ and flipped the station to a simulcast with WSIS. Then it briefly had an All-Comedy format, then a brief satellite-fed Classic rock format with local shows on the weekend. The station became Smooth Jazz under the WJZX call letters. During this time, the station made a long-planned move into the Charleston radio market by changing its city of license to Hollywood and moving its tower to Mount Pleasant, which was completed in 2003. When the move was completed, the station flipped again to Adult Urban Contemporary as WXST, adopting the \\"Star 99.7\\" handle. On September 6, 2017, the sale of the station to Saga Communications was complete. Call letter history Prior to this, the WXST call letters were first assigned to a station licensed to Loudon, Tennessee, beginning May 24, 1991. It remained until they were dropped on March 16, 1998 for WESK.) Then, WXST was assigned to STAR 107.9 in Delaware, Ohio beginning June 26, 1998. They remained until they were dropped on April 23, 2001 for WJHT, only to be reacquired on May 16, 2001. WXST/Delaware was dropped completely for WODB July 27, 2001 (now WVMX).

Breeding began in Latvia in the early twentieth century, and a herd book was established in 1927. The breed was officially recognised in 1952. There are two types, sometimes called the Latvian Harness Horse and the Latvian Riding Horse. The harness type was predominant until about 1960, when demand for sport horses increased and more of the saddle type were bred. History The origins of the Latvian breed go back to 1856, when western European horses were cross-bred with native Latvian horses. In 1890 planned breeding was begun from ten different breeds, principally Hanoverian and Oldenburger, with some Holsteiner influence. More than 100 Oldenburgers (65 stallions and 42 mares) were imported from Germany and the Netherlands between 1920 and 1941, and these were the basis of the breed, which was officially recognised in 1952. From about 1960 or 1970, Hanoverian, Arab and some Thoroughbred blood was used to create a lighter sport horse type, the Latvian Riding Horse.

RAD is a member of the $1.3 billion RAD Group of companies. History RAD was founded by brothers Yehuda and Zohar Zisapel in 1981 as a spin-off from Bynet, a networking hardware distribution company founded by Yehuda in 1973. Their goal was to develop their own products; the company was simply named RAD, for Research And Development. RAD first successful product was a miniature (by 1980s standards) modem for telephone lines that did not require a separate power source. This novel concept quickly became a commercial success, and by 1985, RAD annual revenues reached $5.5 million. This initial product line evolved into RAD Data Communications, the largest company within the RAD Group. In 2014, RAD opened a new $32 million advanced R&D; center for developing NFV and SDN solutions in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba. The company is active in industry standardization bodies such as the Broadband Forum, ETSI NFV ISG, International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF). One of the 46 copies of Rodin's The Thinker that were made from the original cast after the sculptor's death was acquired by Yehuda Zisapel and placed on permanent exhibit in the lobby of RAD's current Tel Aviv headquarters when the building was opened in 2000.

Some 15 minutes after takeoff, the aircraft lost power in one of its engines, which prompted the crew to return to the airport for an emergency landing. In doing so, the pilots missed the airport runway, and the airplane descended until it hit the ground, disintegrating after impact. Of the 117 people aboard, 116 died.

Accident  The airplane had departed Port Sudan at 4:00 am (UTC+3), bound for Khartoum. The pilot radioed about ten minutes after take-off about a problem with one of the engines, and that he would return to the airport to make an emergency landing. However, the plane plummeted into the ground before returning to the airfield and immediately caught fire. All but one of the 117 occupants of the aircraft— most of them Sudanese— perished in the accident. There were three Indians, a Briton, a Chinese, an Emirati, and an Ethiopian among the dead as well. A two-year-old boy was the sole survivor.

For example, \\\\sqrt2 can be expanded to a periodic continued fraction, namely as [1,2,2,2,...]. The partial denominators {ai} can in general be any real or complex numbers. That general case is treated in the article convergence problem. The remainder of this article is devoted to the subject of simple continued fractions that are also periodic. In other words, the remainder of this article assumes that all the partial denominators ai (i ≥ 1) are positive integers. Purely periodic and periodic fractions Since all the partial numerators in a regular continued fraction are equal to unity we can adopt a shorthand notation in which the continued fraction shown above is written as : \\\\begin{align} x& = [a_0;a_1,a_2,\\\\dots,a_k,a_{k+1},a_{k+2},\\\\dots,a_{k+m},a_{k+1},a_{k+2},\\\\dots,a_{k+m},\\\\dots]\\\\ & = [a_0;a_1,a_2,\\\\dots,a_k,\\\\overline{a_{k+1},a_{k+2},\\\\dots,a_{k+m}}] \\\\end{align} where, in the second line, a vinculum marks the repeating block. Some textbooks use the notation : \\\\begin{align} x& = [a_0;a_1,a_2,\\\\dots,a_k,\\\\dot a_{k+1},a_{k+2},\\\\dots,\\\\dot a_{k+m}] \\\\end{align} where the repeating block is indicated by dots over its first and last terms. If the initial non-repeating block is not present - that is, if k = -1, a₀ = aₘ and : x = [\\\\overline{a_0;a_1,a_2,\\\\dots,a_{m-1}}], the regular continued fraction x is said to be purely periodic. For example, the regular continued fraction for the golden ratio φ - given by [1; 1, 1, 1, …] - is purely periodic, while the regular continued fraction for the square root of two - [1; 2, 2, 2, …] - is periodic, but not purely periodic. As unimodular matrices Such periodic fractions are in one-to-one correspondence with the real quadratic irrationals. The correspondence is explicitly provided by Minkowski's question-mark function. That article also reviews tools that make it easy to work with such continued fractions. Consider first the purely periodic part : x = [\\\\overline{0;a_1,a_2,\\\\dots,a_m}], This can, in fact, be written as :x = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha x+\\\\beta}{\\\\gamma x+\\\\delta} with the \\\\alpha,\\\\beta,\\\\gamma,\\\\delta being integers, and satisfying \\\\alpha \\\\delta-\\\\beta \\\\gamma=1. Explicit values can be obtained by writing :S = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\ 1 & 1\\\\end{pmatrix} which is termed a \\"shift\\", so that :S^n = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\ n & 1\\\\end{pmatrix} and similarly a reflection, given by :T\\\\mapsto \\\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1\\\\ 0 & 1\\\\end{pmatrix} so that T^2=I. Both of these matrices are unimodular, arbitrary products remain unimodular. Then, given x as above, the corresponding matrix is of the form This is now available as a reprint from Dover Publications. :S^{a_1}TS^{a_2}T\\\\cdots TS^{a_m} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\alpha & \\\\beta\\\\ \\\\gamma & \\\\delta\\\\end{pmatrix} and one has :x = [\\\\overline{0;a_1,a_2,\\\\dots,a_m}] = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha x+\\\\beta}{\\\\gamma x+\\\\delta} as the explicit form. As all of the matrix entries are integers, this matrix belongs to the modular group SL(2,\\\\mathbb{Z}). Relation to quadratic irrationals A quadratic irrational number is an irrational real root of the quadratic equation : ax^2 + bx + c = 0 where the coefficients a, b, and c are integers, and the discriminant, b2 − 4ac, is greater than zero. By the quadratic formula every quadratic irrational can be written in the form : \\\\zeta = \\\\frac{P+\\\\sqrt{D}}{Q} where P, D, and Q are integers, D > 0 is not a perfect square (but not necessarily square-free), and Q divides the quantity P2 − D (for example (6+)/4). Such a quadratic irrational may also be written in another form with a square-root of a square-free number (for example (3+)/2) as explained for quadratic irrationals. By considering the complete quotients of periodic continued fractions, Euler was able to prove that if x is a regular periodic continued fraction, then x is a quadratic irrational number. The proof is straightforward. From the fraction itself, one can construct the quadratic equation with integral coefficients that x must satisfy. Lagrange proved the converse of Euler's theorem: if x is a quadratic irrational, then the regular continued fraction expansion of x is periodic. Given a quadratic irrational x one can construct m different quadratic equations, each with the same discriminant, that relate the successive complete quotients of the regular continued fraction expansion of x to one another. Since there are only finitely many of these equations (the coefficients are bounded), the complete quotients (and also the partial denominators) in the regular continued fraction that represents x must eventually repeat. Reduced surds The quadratic surd \\\\zeta = \\\\frac{P + \\\\sqrt{D}}{Q} is said to be reduced if \\\\zeta > 1 and its conjugate \\\\eta = \\\\frac{P - \\\\sqrt{D}}{Q} satisfies the inequalities -1 < \\\\eta < 0. For instance, the golden ratio \\\\phi = (1 + \\\\sqrt{5})/2 = 1.618033... is a reduced surd because it is greater than one and its conjugate (1 - \\\\sqrt{5})/2 = -0.618033... is greater than −1 and less than zero. On the other hand, the square root of two \\\\sqrt{2} = (0 + \\\\sqrt{8})/2 is greater than one but is not a reduced surd because its conjugate -\\\\sqrt{2} = (0 - \\\\sqrt{8})/2 is less than −1\\\\. Galois proved that the regular continued fraction which represents a quadratic surd ζ is purely periodic if and only if ζ is a reduced surd. In fact, Galois showed more than this. He also proved that if ζ is a reduced quadratic surd and η is its conjugate, then the continued fractions for ζ and for (−1/η) are both purely periodic, and the repeating block in one of those continued fractions is the mirror image of the repeating block in the other. In symbols we have : \\\\begin{align} \\\\zeta& = [\\\\overline{a_0;a_1,a_2,\\\\dots,a_{m-1}}][3pt] \\\\frac{-1}{\\\\eta}& = [\\\\overline{a_{m-1};a_{m-2},a_{m-3},\\\\dots,a_0}]\\\\, \\\\end{align} where ζ is any reduced quadratic surd, and η is its conjugate. From these two theorems of Galois a result already known to Lagrange can be deduced. If r > 1 is a rational number that is not a perfect square, then : \\\\sqrt{r} = [a_0;\\\\overline{a_1,a_2,\\\\dots,a_2,a_1,2a_0}]. In particular, if n is any non- square positive integer, the regular continued fraction expansion of contains a repeating block of length m, in which the first m − 1 partial denominators form a palindromic string. Length of the repeating block By analyzing the sequence of combinations : \\\\frac{P_n + \\\\sqrt{D}}{Q_n} that can possibly arise when ζ = (P + )/Q is expanded as a regular continued fraction, Lagrange showed that the largest partial denominator ai in the expansion is less than 2, and that the length of the repeating block is less than 2D. More recently, sharper arguments based on the divisor function have shown that L(D), the length of the repeating block for a quadratic surd of discriminant D, is given by : L(D) = \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\sqrt{D}\\\\ln{D}) where the big O means \\"on the order of\\", or \\"asymptotically proportional to\\" (see big O notation). Canonical form and repetend The following iterative algorithm can be used to obtain the continued fraction expansion in canonical form (S is any natural number that is not a perfect square): :m_0=0\\\\,! :d_0=1\\\\,! :a_0=\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\sqrt{S}\\\\right\\\\rfloor\\\\,! :m_{n+1}=d_na_n-m_n\\\\,! :d_{n+1}=\\\\frac{S-m_{n+1}^2}{d_n}\\\\,! :a_{n+1} =\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{S}+m_{n+1}}{d_{n+1}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor =\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{a_0+m_{n+1}}{d_{n+1}}\\\\right\\\\rfloor!. Notice that mn, dn, and an are always integers. The algorithm terminates when this triplet is the same as one encountered before. The algorithm can also terminate on ai when ai = 2 a0, which is easier to implement. The expansion will repeat from then on. The sequence [a0; a1, a2, a3, ...] is the continued fraction expansion: :\\\\sqrt{S} = a_0 + \\\\cfrac{1}{a_1 + \\\\cfrac{1}{a_2 + \\\\cfrac{1}{a_3+\\\\,\\\\ddots}}} =Example= To obtain as a continued fraction, begin with m0 = 0; d0 = 1; and a0 = 10 (102 = 100 and 112 = 121 > 114 so 10 chosen). : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sqrt{114} & = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}+0}{1} = 10+\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}-10}{1} = 10+\\\\frac{(\\\\sqrt{114}-10)(\\\\sqrt{114}+10)}{\\\\sqrt{114}+10} \\\\ & = 10+\\\\frac{114-100}{\\\\sqrt{114}+10} = 10+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}+10}{14}}. \\\\end{align} : m_{1} = d_{0} \\\\cdot a_{0} - m_{0} = 1 \\\\cdot 10 - 0 = 10 \\\\,. : d_{1} = \\\\frac{S-m_{1}^2}{d_0} = \\\\frac{114-10^2}{1} = 14 \\\\,. : a_{1} = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{a_0+m_{1}}{d_{1}} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{10+10}{14} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = \\\\left\\\\lfloor \\\\frac{20}{14} \\\\right\\\\rfloor = 1 \\\\,. So, m1 = 10; d1 = 14; and a1 = 1\\\\. : \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}+10}{14} = 1+\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}-4}{14} = 1+\\\\frac{114-16}{14(\\\\sqrt{114}+4)} = 1+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}+4}{7}}. Next, m2 = 4; d2 = 7; and a2 = 2\\\\. : \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}+4}{7} = 2+\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}-10}{7} = 2+\\\\frac{14}{7(\\\\sqrt{114}+10)} = 2+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}+10}{2}}. : \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}+10}{2}=10+\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}-10}{2}=10+\\\\frac{14}{2(\\\\sqrt{114}+10)} = 10+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}+10}{7}}. : \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}+10}{7}=2+\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}-4}{7}=2+\\\\frac{98}{7(\\\\sqrt{114}+4)} = 2+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}+4}{14}}. : \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}+4}{14}=1+\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}-10}{14}=1+\\\\frac{14}{14(\\\\sqrt{114}+10)} = 1+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}+10}{1}}. : \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}+10}{1}=20+\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}-10}{1}=20+\\\\frac{14}{\\\\sqrt{114}+10} = 20+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{114}+10}{14}}. Now, loop back to the second equation above. Consequently, the simple continued fraction for the square root of 114 is : \\\\sqrt{114} = [10;\\\\overline{1,2,10,2,1,20}].\\\\, is approximately 10.67707 82520. After one expansion of the repetend, the continued fraction yields the rational fraction \\\\frac{21194}{1985} whose decimal value is approx. 10.67707 80856, a relative error of 0.0000016% or 1.6 parts in 100,000,000. =Generalized continued fraction= A more rapid method is to evaluate its generalized continued fraction. From the formula derived there: : \\\\sqrt{z} = \\\\sqrt{x^2+y} = x+\\\\cfrac{y} {2x+\\\\cfrac{y} {2x+\\\\cfrac{y} {2x+\\\\ddots}}} = x+\\\\cfrac{2x \\\\cdot y} {2(2z-y)-y-\\\\cfrac{y^2} {2(2z-y)-\\\\cfrac{y^2} {2(2z-y)-\\\\ddots}}} and the fact that 114 is 2/3 of the way between 102=100 and 112=121 results in : \\\\sqrt{114} = \\\\cfrac{\\\\sqrt{1026}}{3} = \\\\cfrac{\\\\sqrt{32^2+2}}{3} = \\\\cfrac{32}{3}+\\\\cfrac{2/3} {64+\\\\cfrac{2} {64+\\\\cfrac{2} {64+\\\\cfrac{2} {64+\\\\ddots}}}} = \\\\cfrac{32}{3}+\\\\cfrac{2} {192+\\\\cfrac{18} {192+\\\\cfrac{18} {192+\\\\ddots}}}, which is simply the aforementioned [10;1,2, 10,2,1, 20,1,2] evaluated at every third term. Combining pairs of fractions produces : \\\\sqrt{114} = \\\\cfrac{\\\\sqrt{32^2+2}}{3} = \\\\cfrac{32}{3}+\\\\cfrac{64/3} {2050-1-\\\\cfrac{1} {2050-\\\\cfrac{1} {2050-\\\\ddots}}}= \\\\cfrac{32}{3}+\\\\cfrac{64} {6150-3-\\\\cfrac{9} {6150-\\\\cfrac{9} {6150-\\\\ddots}}}, which is now [10;1,2, \\\\overline{10,2,1,20,1,2}] evaluated at the third term and every six terms thereafter.

Because of its historic development in the 19th century it is also referred to as the Krupp town. Districts The town consists of 4 districts: * Berndorf- Stadt * St. Veit * Ödlitz * Veitsau / Steinhof History Artefacts from various epoques of the Stone Age prove that there was a settlement in this region. Perindorf is likely to have its name from a man named Pero, who settled here in 1070. The name Perendorf was first mentioned in 1133. Throughout the following centuries, Berndorf was ravaged by the Magyars and the Ottomans. In the 18th century, metal-working companies such as Neuhirtenberger Kupferhammer, which used the first steam engine in all of Lower Austria in 1836, settled in this region. Before that, hydropower coming from the Triesting was the main energy source. In the 19th century the majority of the inhabitants of Berndorf and its neighbouring villages worked in the metal industry. In 1844, Berndorf consisted of no more than 50 houses with about 180 inhabitants, when the cutlery factory of Alexander Schoeller and Hermann Krupp was founded. Initially, there were 50 workers, but throughout the years, the company developed and turned into a multi-national combine with over 6,000 employees. The development of the city of Berndorf was closely related to the history of the Krupp family. Arthur Krupp, son of Hermann Krupp, founded a private elementary school and a public swimming pool, as well as the neo-baroque St. Margaret's church. In 1923, the communities of Berndorf, St. Veit, Ödlitz and Veitsau were united and formed the city of Berndorf. After the Anschluss in 1938, the Arthur Krupp company became a part of the German Krupp combine. Because of its industrial importance, Berndorf was also an important target of air attacks. During World War II, Berndorf was not even spared the forces of nature. The floods in 1939 and 1944 were the most destructive floods in the history of the Triesting river. When the war had ended, the metal company was confiscated by the Soviet Army and incorporated into the USIA. In 1957, it was given back to the State of Austria and merged with the Vereinigte Aluminiumwerke Ranshofen (VAW). Because of financial problems of the socialised industries in the 1980s, the Berndorf consortium was spun off and passed into private hands.

He was personally awarded by Adolf Hitler the Order of the German Eagle, Nazi Germany's highest distinctions, on his 90th birthday in 1937, for his support to the Nazi Party in the late 1920s.  Biography  Emil Kirdorf was born at Mettmann, Rhine Province. His father was a wealthy owner of a weaving mill. He had a brother named Adolf who would be his business partner during his adult life. Kirdorf volunteered a year in 1864 in Hamburg to work in an export enterprise. A year later, he worked in a textile company in Krefeld. The family's mill went bankrupt, mainly because of the management's refusal to introduce mechanical looms. Kirdorf therefore changed to mining industry in which he worked as an accountant. Following the Franco-Prussian War, he became director of Zeche Holland in 1871. Two years later, the entrepreneur Friedrich Grillo offered him the position of commercial director in the Gelsenkirchener Bergwerks-AG (GBAG) company. He became general manager of GBAG in 1893. He steered the company through the Long Depression of the 1870s, and held this position until 1926. Under his direction, the GBAG became the largest coal mines European enterprise, and Emil Kirdorf became known as the \\"Chimney Baron\\" (Schlotbarons). Hansa, Zollern and Germania companies were integrated to GBAG under Kirdorf's leadership. Kirdorf then was one of the main founder of the Rheinisch-Westfälisches Kohlen-Syndikat employers union in 1893, member of its board of directors until 1913. 98 mine enterprises of the Ruhr belonged to this union, which tried, among others aims, to prevent dumping. Kirdorf was also one of the founding member of the pangermanist Alldeutscher Verband league in 1891, which advocated imperialist policies. He was also a founding member of the Freie Ukraine (Free Ukraine) association, of the Kolonialverein (founded in 1882) and of the Flottenverein, a lobby in favour of extension of the Kaiserliche Marine against the British Navy. After World War I, he was a co-founder of the Wirtschaftsvereinigung zur Förderung der geistigen Wiederaufbaukräfte (Trade Association for the Promotion of the Mental Reconstruction Forces), which subsided Alfred Hugenberg's media empire. In September 1918, it required the resignation of the Emperor Wilhelm II. The GBAG thereafter concentrated in its coal activities. Kirdorf lost his key- position to Hugo Stinnes, to whose management policies he was vehemently opposed. Stinnes intended to make GBAG into the basis of a German trust, which was opposed by Kirdorf. After Stinnes' death in 1924, Kirdorf regained his position and entered the executive committee. In 1926, the GBAG formed the Vereinigte Stahlwerke, of which it controlled 15%. Others groups included ThyssenKrupp (26%) and PhoenixKrupp. Kirdorf died in Mülheim in 1938.  Role during Nazi Germany  Kirdorf was well known as a reactionary for his authoritarian and anti-democratic views. He rejected the Weimar Republic and fought the workers' movement and trade unions. According to his conceptions, the state and the entrepreneurs had to organize social order. Thus, he became an active promoter of Hitler's rise to power. He met him for the first time on 4 July 1927, and funded the NSDAP. Kirdorf then joined the NSDAP in 1927, but left it the following year, alleging as reason the influence of Gregor Strasser on the party. On 1 August 1929, he was invited as a guest of to the Nazi Party's Congress in Nuremberg. Kirdorf joined again the NSDAP in 1934. He mainly supported it in order to divert the working class from Marxism. It was also at Kirdorf's instigation that Hitler wrote Der Weg zum Wiederaufstieg in 1927, intended for exclusive distribution to, and consumption by, the leading industrialists of Germany.Henry Ashby Turner, jr., Hitler's secret pamphlet for industrialists, 1927. On 26 October 1927, fourteen industrial employers attended a lecture by Hitler in the Kirdorfs' house. Kirdorf then organized, in August 1931, an exchange of views between Hitler and representatives of the steel industry. Joseph Goebbels noted in his diary, on 15 November 1936, that Hitler had told him about \\"how he wanted to shoot himself once,\\" because of increasing debts, but that Kirdorf helped him with 100,000 Marks. Hitler personally awarded to him, on 10 April 1937, date of Kirdorf's 90th birthday, the Order of the German Eagle, the highest distinction of the Third Reich. He benefited on 13 July 1938 from a state funeral in Gelsenkirchen, with Hitler deposing a crown on his coffin.

Thompson, 394 U.S. 618 (1969), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court that helped to establish a fundamental \\"right to travel\\" in U.S. law. Although the Constitution does not mention the right to travel, it is implied by the other rights given in the Constitution.Schram, Sanford. 2006. \\"Shapiro v. Thompson\\". Federalism in America: An Encyclopedia. (Although the right was recognized under the Equal Protection clause in this case, pre- Fourteenth Amendment, the right to travel was understood as protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause (Article IV), as a privilege of citizenship, and therefore might have been applied to the states under the Privileges or Immunities Clause of Amendment XIV, as J. Stewart wanted.) The ruling in the case invalidated state durational residency requirements for public assistance. Facts of the case The Connecticut Welfare Department invoked Connecticut law denying an application for Aid to Families with Dependent Children assistance to appellee Vivian Marie Thompson, a 19-year-old unwed mother of one child and pregnant with her second child, because she had changed her residence in June 1966 from the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, to Hartford, Connecticut, to live with her mother. When her mother was no longer able to support her, she and her infant son moved to her own apartment in Hartford in August 1966. Thompson could not work or enter a work training program. Her application for assistance, filed in August 1966, was denied in November solely on the ground that she had not lived in the State for a year before her application was filed, a requirement under Connecticut law. Case history Thompson brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut where a three-judge panel, one judge dissenting, declared the provision of Connecticut law unconstitutional, holding that the waiting-period requirement is unconstitutional because it \\"has a chilling effect on the right to travel\\" and also holding that the provision violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \\"because the denial of relief to those resident in the State for less than a year is not based on any permissible purpose but is solely designed, as 'Connecticut states quite frankly,' 'to protect its fisc by discouraging entry of those who come needing relief'\\" (decision of the Court). This case examined laws that required a period of residence in a jurisdiction before welfare benefits would become available to a new resident. The state asserted that its interest in requiring this waiting period was to deter needy citizens from other states from coming to the state for the sole purpose of receiving superior welfare benefits. The Court held that the purpose of inhibiting the migration of needy people was a constitutionally impermissible objective. The state also argued that this requirement was an attempt to apportion services based on how much residence has contributed (i.e. longer residence means more taxes paid) but such apportionment is not allowed under the Equal protection clause. The state asserted that the requirement served the states interest in efficient administration of welfare by providing an objective test of residence, allowing for planning a budget, minimizing fraud, and encouragement entry into the workforce before seeking welfare. Decision of the Court Because the constitutional right to free movement between states was implicated, the Court applied a standard of strict scrutiny and held none of these interests were sufficient to sustain the waiting requirement. The Court held that there was no evidence that the requirement would make planning a budget more predictable, and that if a waiting period encouraged new residents to enter the workforce it should also be applied to current residents, and that the interest in deterring fraud and having an objective verification of residence could be better served by less restrictive means (e.g. calling welfare recipients periodically). Finally the Court rejected the argument that Congress had authorized the waiting period because Congress does not have the power to authorize violations of the equal protection clause. The Court reaffirmed the right to travel under the 14th Amendment's Privileges and Immunities clause in Saenz v. Roe (1999).Davis, Martha F. 1999. \\"The Evolving Right to Travel: Saenz v. Roe.\\" Publius: The Journal of Federalism 29 (Spring): 95-110. Dissenting opinions Chief Justice Warren, joined by Justice Black, dissented. Congress has the power to authorize these restrictions under the commerce clause. Under the commerce clause, Congress needs only a rational basis to a legitimate state interest, not a necessary relation to a compelling interest. Justice Harlan also dissented, arguing that the requirement of a compelling interest and necessary relationship between the law and that interest serve as an example of intermediate scrutiny.

First released in 1994, B-Prolog is now a widely used CLP system. The constraint solver of B-Prolog was ranked top in two categories in the Second International Solvers Competition,Results of the Second International Competition of CSP and Max-CSP Solvers and it also took the second place in P class in the second ASP solver competition http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~dtai/events/ASP-competition/index.shtml and the second place overall in the third ASP solver competition.BPSolver’s Solutions to the Third ASP Competition Problems  Association for Logic Programming B-Prolog underpins the PRISM system, a logic-based probabilistic reasoning and learning system. B-Prolog is a commercial product, but it can be used for learning and non-profit research purposes free of charge (since version 7.8 for individual users, including commercial individual users, B-Prolog is free of charge ).  Matching clauses  A matching clause is a form of a clause where the determinacy and input/output unifications are denoted explicitly. The compiler translates matching clauses into matching trees and generates indexes for all input arguments. The compilation of matching clauses is much simpler than that of normal Prolog clauses because no complex program analysis or specialization is necessary; and the generated code tends to be more compact and faster. The B-Prolog compiler and most of the library predicates are written in matching clauses. A matching clause takes the following form: H, G => B where \`H\` is an atomic formula, \`G\` and \`B\` are two sequences of atomic formulas. \`H\` is called the head, \`G\` the guard, and \`B\` the body of the clause. No call in \`G\` can bind variables in \`H\` and all calls in \`G\` must be in-line tests. In other words, the guard must be flat. The following gives an example predicate in matching clauses that merges two sorted lists: merge([],Ys,Zs) => Zs=Ys. merge(Xs,[],Zs) => Zs=Xs. merge([XXs],[YYs],Zs),X Zs=[XZsT],merge(Xs,[YYs],ZsT). merge(Xs,[YYs],Zs) => Zs=[YZsT],merge(Xs,Ys,ZsT). The cons \`[YYs]\` occurs in both the head and the body of the third clause. To avoid reconstructing the term, we can rewrite the clause into the following: merge([XXs],Ys,Zs),Ys=[Y_],X Zs=[XZsT],merge(Xs,Ys,ZsT). The call \`Ys=[Y_]\` in the guard matches \`Ys\` against the pattern \`[Y_]\`.  Action rules  The lack of a facility for programming \\"active\\" sub-goals that can be reactive to the environment has been considered one of the weaknesses of logic programming. To overcome this, B-Prolog provides a simple and yet powerful language, called Action Rules (AR), for programming agents. An agent is a subgoal that can be delayed and can later be activated by events. Each time an agent is activated, some action may be executed. Agents are a more general notion than delay constructs in early Prolog systems and processes in concurrent logic programming languages in the sense that agents can be responsive to various kinds of events including instantiation, domain, time, and user-defined events. An action rule takes the following H, G, {E} => B where \`H\` is a pattern for agents, \`G\` is a sequence of conditions on the agents, \`E\` is a set of patterns for events that can activate the agents, and \`B\` is a sequence of actions performed by the agents when they are activated. When the event pattern \`E\` together with the enclosing braces is missing, an action rule degenerates into a matching clause. A set of built-in events is provided for programming constraint propagators and interactive graphical user interfaces. For example, \`ins(X)\` is an event that is posted when the variable \`X\` is instantiated. A user program can create and post its own events and define agents to handle them. A user-defined event takes the form of \`event(X,O)\` where \`X\` is a variable, called a suspension variable, that connects the event with its handling agents, and \`O\` is a Prolog term that contains the information to be transmitted to the agents. The built-in \`post(E)\` posts the event \`E\`. Consider the following examples: echo(X),{event(X,Mes)}=>writeln(Mes). ping(T),{time(T)} => writeln(ping). The agent \`echo(X)\` echoes whatever message it receives. For example, ?-echo(X),post(event(X,hello)),post(event(X,world)). outputs the message \`hello\` followed by \`world\`. The agent \`ping(T)\` responds to time events from the timer \`T\`. Each time it receives a time event, it prints the message \`ping\`. For example, ?-timer(T,1000),ping(T),repeat,fail. creates a timer that posts a time event every second and creates an agent \`ping(T)\` to respond to the events. The loop after the agent is needed to make the agent perpetual. AR has been found useful for programming simple concurrency, implementing constraint propagators, and developing interactive graphical user interfaces. It has served as an intermediate language for compiling Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) and Answer Set Programs (ASP).  CLP(FD)  Like many Prolog- based finite-domain constraint solvers, B-Prolog's finite-domain solver was heavily influenced by the CHIP system. The first fully-fledged solver was released with B-Prolog version 2.1 in March 1997. That solver was implemented in an early version of AR, called delay clauses. During the past decade, the implementation language AR has been extended to support a rich class of domain events (\`ins(X)\`,\`bound(X)\`,\`dom(X,E)\`, and \`dom_any(X,E)\`) for programming constraint propagators and the system has been enriched with new domains (Boolean, trees, and finite sets), global constraints, and specialized fast constraint propagators. Recently, the two built-ins \`in/2\` and \`notin/2\` have been extended to allow positive and negative table (also called extensional) constraints. Thanks to the employment of AR as the implementation language, the constraint solving part of B-Prolog is relatively small (3800 lines of Prolog code and 6000 lines of C code, including comments and spaces) but its performance is very competitive. The AR language is open to the user for implementing problem-specific propagators. For example, the following defines a propagator for maintaining arc consistency for the constraint \`X+Y #= C\`. Whenever an inner element \`Ey\` is excluded from the domain of \`Y\`, this propagator is triggered to exclude \`Ex\`, the counterpart of \`Ey\`, from the domain of \`X\`. For the constraint \`X+Y #= C\`, we need to generate two propagators, namely, \`'X_in_C_Y_ac'(X,Y,C)\` and \`'X_in_C_Y_ac'(Y,X,C)\`, to maintain the arc consistency. In addition to these two propagators, we also need to generate propagators for maintaining interval consistency since no \`dom(Y,Ey)\` event is posted if the excluded value happens to be a bound. The constraint needs to be preprocessed to make it arc consistent before the propagators are generated. 'X_in_C_Y_ac'(X,Y,C),var(X),var(Y), {dom(Y,Ey)} => Ex is C-Ey, domain_set_false(X,Ex). 'X_in_C_Y_ac'(X,Y,C) => true.  Arrays and the array subscript notation  In B-Prolog, the maximum arity of a structure is 65535. This entails that a structure can be used as a one- dimensional array, and a multi-dimensional array can be represented as a structure of structures. To facilitate creating arrays, B-Prolog provides a built-in, called \`new_array(X,Dims)\`, where \`X\` must be an uninstantiated variable and \`Dims\` a list of positive integers that specifies the dimensions of the array. For example, the call \`new_array(X,[10,20])\` binds \`X\` to a two dimensional array whose first dimension has 10 elements and second dimension has 20 elements. All the array elements are initialized to be free variables. The built-in predicate \`arg/3\` can be used to access array elements, but it requires a temporary variable to store the result, and a chain of calls to access an element of a multi-dimensional array. To facilitate accessing array elements, B-Prolog supports the array subscript notation \`X[I1,...,In]\`, where \`X\` is a structure and each \`Ii\` is an integer expression. This common notation for accessing arrays is, however, not part of the standard Prolog syntax. To accommodate this notation, the parser is modified to insert a token \`^\` between a variable token and \`[\`. So, the notation \`X[I1,...,In]\` is just a shorthand for \`X^[I1,...,In]\`. This notation is interpreted as an array access when it occurs in an arithmetic expression, a constraint, or as an argument of a call to \`@=/2\`. In any other context, it is treated as the term itself. The array subscript notation can also be used to access elements of lists. For example, the \`nth/3\` predicate can be defined as follows: nth(I,L,E) :- E @= L[I].  Loops with foreach and list comprehension  Prolog relies on recursion to describe loops. The lack of powerful loop constructs has arguably made Prolog less acceptable to beginners and less productive to experienced programmers because it is often tedious to define small auxiliary recursive predicates for loops. The emergence of constraint programming constructs such as CLP(FD) has further revealed this weakness of Prolog as a modeling language. B-Prolog provides a built-in, called \`foreach\`, for iterating over collections and the list comprehension notation for constructing lists. The \`foreach\` built-in has a very simple syntax and semantics. For example, foreach(A in [a,b], I in 1..2, write((A,I))) outputs four tuples \`(a,1)\`, \`(a,2)\`, \`(b,1)\`, and \`(b,2)\`. Syntactically, \`foreach\` is a variable-length call whose last argument specifies a goal to be executed for each combination of values in a sequence of collections. A \`foreach\` call may also give a list of variables that are local to each iteration and a list of accumulators that can be used to accumulate values from each iteration. With accumulators, we can use \`foreach\` to describe recurrences for computing aggregates. Recurrences have to be read procedurally and thus do not fit well with Prolog. For this reason, we adopt the list comprehension notation from functional languages. A list comprehension is a list whose first element has the functor '\`:\`'. A list of this form is interpreted as a list comprehension in calls to \`@=/2\` and arithmetic constraints. For example, the query X @= [(A,I) : A in [a,b], I in 1..2] binds \`X\` to the list \`[(a,1),(a,2),(b,1),(b,2)]\`. A list comprehension is treated as a \`foreach\` call with an accumulator in the implementation. Calls to \`foreach\` and list comprehensions are translated into tail-recursive predicates. Therefore, there is no or little penalty of using these constructs compared with using recursion. The loop constructs considerably enhance the modeling power of CLP(FD). The following gives a program for the N-queens problem in B-Prolog: queens(N):- length(Qs,N), Qs :: 1..N, foreach(I in 1..N-1, J in I+1..N, (Qs[I] #\\\\= Qs[J], abs(Qs[I]-Qs[J]) #\\\\= J-I)), labeling([ff],Qs), writeln(Qs). The array notation on lists helps shorten the description. Without it, the \`foreach\` loop in the program would have to be written as follows: foreach(I in 1..N-1, J in I+1..N,[Qi,Qj], (nth(Qs,I,Qi), nth(Qs,J,Qj), Qi #\\\\= Qj, abs(Qi-Qj) #\\\\= J-I)), where \`Qi\` and \`Qj\` are declared local to each iteration. The following gives a program for the N-queens problem, which uses a Boolean variable for each square on the board. bool_queens(N):- new_array(Qs,[N,N]), Vars @= [Qs[I,J] : I in 1..N, J in 1..N], Vars :: 0..1, foreach(I in 1..N, % one queen in each row sum([Qs[I,J] : J in 1..N]) #= 1), foreach(J in 1..N, % one queen in each column sum([Qs[I,J] : I in 1..N]) #= 1), foreach(K in 1-N..N-1, % at most one queen in each left-down diag sum([Qs[I,J] : I in 1..N, J in 1..N, I-J=:=K]) #=< 1), foreach(K in 2..2*N, % at most one queen in each left-up diag sum([Qs[I,J] : I in 1..N, J in 1..N, I+J=:=K]) #=< 1), labeling(Vars), foreach(I in 1..N,[Row], (Row @= [Qs[I,J] : J in 1..N], writeln(Row))).  Tabling  Tabling has been found increasingly important for not only helping beginners write workable declarative programs but also developing real-world applications such as natural language processing, model checking, and machine learning applications. B-Prolog implements a tabling mechanism, called linear tabling, which is based on iterative computation of looping subgoals rather than suspension of them to compute the fixed points. The PRISM system, which heavily relies on tabling, has been the main driving force for the design and implementation of B-Prolog's tabling system. The idea of tabling is to memorize the answers to tabled calls and use the answers to resolve subsequent variant calls. In B-Prolog, as in XSB, tabled predicates are declared explicitly by declarations in the following form: :-table P1/N1,...,Pk/Nk. For example, the following tabled predicate defines the transitive closure of a relation as given by \`edge/2\`. :-table path/2. path(X,Y):-edge(X,Y). path(X,Y):-path(X,Z),edge(Z,Y). With tabling, any query to the program is guaranteed to terminate as long as the term sizes are bounded. By default, all the arguments of a tabled call are used in variant checking and all answers are tabled for a tabled predicate. B-Prolog supports table modes, which allow the system to use only input arguments in variant checking and table answers selectively. The table mode declaration :-table p(M1,...,Mn):C. instructs the system how to do tabling on \`p/n\`, where \`C\`, called a cardinality limit, is an integer which limits the number of answers to be tabled, and each \`Mi\` is a mode which can be \`min\`, \`max\`, \`+\` (input), or \`-\` (output). An argument with the mode \`min\` or \`max\` is assumed to be output. If the cardinality limit \`C\` is \`1\`, it can be omitted with the preceding '\`:\`'. Table modes are very useful for declarative description of dynamic programming problems. For example, the following program encodes the Dijkstra's algorithm for finding a path with the minimum weight between a pair of nodes. :-table sp(+,+,-,min). sp(X,Y,[(X,Y)],W) :- edge(X,Y,W). sp(X,Y,[(X,Z)Path],W) :- edge(X,Z,W1), sp(Z,Y,Path,W2), W is W1+W2. The table mode states that only one path with the minimum weight is tabled for each pair of nodes.

His brother Pádraic played as a keeper for Offaly for many years. Seamus also played as a goalkeeper for Offaly minor team in 1992. Career Seamus signed for UCD in the summer of 1993, making his League of Ireland debut on 19 September, from hometown club Tullamore Town and established himself as one of the league's best keepers before joining Cardiff City in 1998 as cover for Jon Hallworth.http://www.independent.ie/sport/kelly-eyes- no1-spot-at-cardiff-26182143.html Kelly began his Cardiff career on the bench but was called upon at the end of the 1998–99 season when Hallworth broke two ribs in a match against Leyton Orient. He played in the final five matches of the season, making his debut in a 1–0 win over Southend United, helping the club clinch promotion to Division Two. The following season saw the same scenario at the opposite end of the table as Kelly played in the final six matches of the year but was unable to help the club avoid relegation, being released at the end of the season. Kelly returned to Dublin to sign for St Patrick's Athletic. After 3 seasons in Inchicore, Stephen Kenny took him to Bohemians where he challenged for the #1 spot with Matt Gregg. Kelly was first choice during Bohemians' UEFA Champions League campaign in 2003 but never made the goalkeeping spot his own during his time at Dalymount Park. Kelly joined Longford Town from Bohs in 2005 and played a crucial role in the club's FAI Cup run in 2007 and also their gallant battle against relegation that same season. Following a mass exodus of players at the end of that season, Kelly remained on as one of only three players for the 2008 season (the others being Daire Doyle and Alan O'Riordan) as then manager Aaron Callaghan attempted to assemble a squad almost from scratch. Due to persistent back problems, Kelly retired during the summer of 2008. In 2010, he became Goalkeeping coach with Sheloburne.

He distinguished himself during his career by being named East Germany's player of the year three times (1977, 1984 and 1985) – the only East German player to do this besides goalkeeper Jürgen Croy. Dörner's playing career began in 1960 with amateur club BSG Energie WAMA Görlitz and he joined Dynamo Dresden in 1968 where he won five first division DDR-Oberliga titles and five FDGB-Pokale (East German Cup), twice winning the DDR-Oberliga and FDGB-Pokal double. He captained Dynamo Dresden from 1977 to his retirement, and is the club's most decorated captain and he was voted the team's greatest ever player in 1999. During his time at Dynamo Dresden the club only finished outside the top three in the DDR-Oberliga once which was in the season 1982–83 when they finished seventh. He captained the team to their best European seasons, twice reaching the Quarter finals of the European Clubs' Champions Cup in 1977 and 1979. He also guided his team to Quarter finals in the 1975–76 UEFA Cup and both the 1984–85 and the 1985–86 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. This was seen as a big success against teams from Europe's big leagues. Dörner scored an amazing 65 goals in 392 top-flight games for Dynamo Dresden which is a record for a defender in the DDR-Oberliga. He was capped 96 times for East Germany, winning a gold medal as vital part of that country's Olympic team at the 1976 Montreal Olympics. His time as a player ended in summer 1985 and he first took on the role of trainer for the East German Olympic squad in 1990. After German re-unification he coached the Olympic youth side of the united country. From 6 January 1996 until 20 August 1997 he was the trainer for Bundesliga club SV Werder Bremen.

It was a modernized version of the original radio drama aired by CBS in 1938. Danny Kriegler served as the director of the radio drama while Jefferson Kaye served as its producer. The broadcast, its subsequent re-airings and remakes, and multiple airings alongside the original 1938 radio drama made Buffalo, New York the War of the Worlds Radio Capital of The World in a 2009 resolution by the New York State SenateWKBW's War of the Worlds by Bob Koshinski Development=Background WKBW program director Jefferson Kaye, a big fan of the original Orson Welles version from three decades earlier, wondered what The War of the Worlds would sound like if it was made using up-to-date (for 1968) radio news equipment, covering the \\"story\\" of a Martian invasion. Until this point, most radio renditions of the 1938 broadcast were simply script re- readings with different actors or had minor variations to account for significantly different geographical locations. Kaye decided to disregard the original script entirely, move the action to Grand Island, New York, and use actual WKBW disc jockeys and news reporters as actors. Other changes reflected the changing state of the industry: instead of the old-time radio programming fare of the 1930s, WKBW's War of the Worlds broadcast was interwoven into the station's top 40 programming. Production Initially, a script was written for the news reporters to act out; however, upon hearing the rehearsals, it was evident that the news reporters (except Irv Weinstein, a professional radio actor at the beginning of his career) were not adept at scripted radio acting. So instead, Kaye wrote an outline based on the events that were to occur, and the news reporters were then asked to describe the events as they would covering an actual news story. The results were much more realistic for its time, and this was the process used for the actual broadcast. Broadcast The play began a few minutes before 11:00 pm ET with a somber introduction by Danny Neaverth tackling the comparison of radio broadcast technology during the original broadcast and the upcoming production. Neaverth later restated the forewarning of the broadcast's fictitious nature. The initial part of the broadcast alternated from top-40 hits to news break-ins and back until 11:30 ET when continuous reportage and worsening situations on the ground take over. One by one, radio and TV newsmen are killed off, from Jim Fagan until Jefferson Kaye. After Kaye's character dies, Neaverth returns again with his closing speech taken from the novel's epilogue. Cast These personnel participated in the 1968 broadcast, listed as first heard on the play: * Top-of-the-hour newscaster - Joe Downey * Deejay - Sandy Beach * Studio anchors (continuous coverage, in successive order) - Joe Downey, Henry Brach, and Jefferson Kaye * Reporters - Jim Fagan and Don Lancer (WKBW-AM), John Irving and Irv Weinstein (WKBW-TV) Aftermath and legacy=Reaction Despite an exhaustive advertising campaign by WKBW for this show, several people were still convinced upon listening to it that the events unfolding in the show were genuine. Among those fooled included a local newspaper, several small-town police officers, and even the Canadian military, which dispatched troops to the Peace Bridge. Although the public concern over the legitimacy of the broadcast was not as great as was alleged in 1938 (and even that may have been overstated due to an ongoing feud between newspapers and radio at the time), creator Kaye and director Dan Kriegler feared that they were going to lose their jobs as a result of the broadcast; Kaye claimed that he actually submitted his resignation, certain that he was going to be fired the next day. However, no one involved in the broadcast was fired and the resignation was not accepted. Part of the reason for the elevated concern, even compared to the original, was that although the Welles broadcast aired on a little-heard program with no sponsors, WKBW was one of the most-listened-to stations in Western New York at the time, with a 50,000 watt signal audible throughout eastern North America during the broadcast. =Disclaimers= During the broadcast, the show was interrupted every few minutes with commercials from AM&A;'s and other sponsors, ending with the disclaimer that it was just a dramatization. However, at four minutes before midnight, Jefferson Kaye interrupted the taped events to give this disclaimer, but not until after he threatened director Danny Kriegler that he would rip the still- playing tape off its machine and run along Buffalo's Main Street with it if he was not allowed to break in, as the number of calls received by the station from frightened listeners were getting out of hand: > What you are listening to is a dramatization of H.G. Wells' War of the > Worlds on WKBW radio, 1520 on your Buffalo dial. I repeat, it is a > dramatization; it is a play. It is not happening in any way, shape or form. > What you are listening to is a dramatization of H.G. Wells' War of the > Worlds as being portrayed on WKBW 1520 Buffalo. The time is two and one half > minutes before twelve o'clock. Subsequent remakes 1971: Jackson Armstrong was the DJ at the beginning of this broadcast replacing Sandy Beach. This version was edited down to 63 minutes from the 78-minute original. Kaye reprised Danny Neaverth's role in the 1968 broadcast ,but added more emphasis on the aftermath of the adaptation from that year. This was rebroadcast in 1988 by the station in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the original broadcast, then in 1998 and 2001. 1973: Shane \\"The Cosmic Cowboy\\" was the opening DJ and the rest of the broadcast was identical to the version two years earlier albeit with Ron Baskin added as newscaster. However, this version was not a stand-alone broadcast as other WKBW-produced radio thrillers bookend the dramatization. Unlike the previous installments, the disclaimers of \\"This is a dramatization\\" has been placed before and after commercial breaks. WGWE rebroadcast this edition in 2012. 1975: Considered by many to be the weakest of the versions, this edition contained sloppy editing done to eliminate on-air talent no longer with the station, notably Kaye, who would later become WPVI's Action News announcer until his death in 2012. Jim Quinn served as the disk jockey. 1998: A totally new remake was produced by 97 Rock to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the first WKBW version. Kaye and Weinstein (in one of his last appearances before his retirement at the end of that year) reprised their respective roles in the original, while personalities such as Don Postles, Larry Norton, Erie County Executive Dennis Gorski and Mayor Anthony Masiello participated. This was rebroadcast in 2001. It will again be rebroadcast in 2018.https://www.fybush.com/nerw-20181015/ Documentaries Coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the 1968 broadcast, The Making of WKBW's The War of the Worlds was broadcast on WNED-TV, hosted by Bob Koshinski.

Inspired and led by José Gervasio Artigas, it proclaimed independence from the Spanish Crown in 1815 and sent provincial delegates to the Congress of Tucumán with instructions regarding the nonnegotiable objective of declaring full independence for the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata and establishing a confederation of provinces, all of them on equal footing and the government of each being directly accountable to its peoples by direct democratic means of government. The delegates from these provinces were rejected on formalities from the Congress that declared the independence of the United Provinces of South America on July 9, 1816. The Federal League confronted the centralist governments, as well as the interests of the economic and cultural elite of Buenos Aires and Montevideo, in what later amounted to a civil war. In 1820, the federalist governors of Santa Fe and Entre Ríos provinces, Estanislao López and Francisco Ramírez, defeated a diminished Directorial army, ending the centralized government of the United Provinces and establishing a federal agreement with Buenos Aires Province. The league was dissolved after its constituent provinces rejoined the United Provinces, now under a federal provisional organisation, and after the invasion of the Banda Oriental by Brazilian-Portuguese empire and the defeat of Artigas. At its largest extent, the League extended over the territories of present-day Uruguay, the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul and the Argentine provinces of Entre Ríos, Santa Fe, Corrientes, Misiones and Córdoba. It was instrumental in the Guaraní participation on the revolutionary cause). Although the country was intended to extend throughout modern-day Argentina, its leadership was based on Purificación and the Eastern Bank of the Uruguay river. Therefore, it is sometimes considered a predecessor state of modern Uruguay. History On May 13, 1810, the arrival of a British frigate in Montevideo confirmed the rumors circulating in Buenos Aires: France, led by Emperor Napoleon, had invaded Spain, capturing and overthrowing Ferdinand VII Bourbon, the Spanish King. The situation was clear: with the authority of the vice-regency gone, there was a power vacuum. Leading figures in Buenos Aires quickly arranged a meeting and after much discussion it was decided to replace the Spanish rule with a local Junta. After the May Revolution, most of the provinces of the former Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata joined to form the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, also known as United Provinces of South America in 1810. The four provinces of Upper Peru (current-day Bolivia) were occupied by Spanish Royalist forces and the other ten provinces were under pressure from Royalist forces. José Gervasio Artigas In 1810, Spain moved the headquarters for the Viceroyalty of the River Plate to Montevideo after the May Revolution forced them to abandon Buenos Aires. On February 15, 1811 José Gervasio Artigas left his home of Montevideo and moved to Buenos Aires to offer his military services. The people of Spanish America were fighting for their freedom and Artigas wished to defend these ideals in the Eastern Bank. At the beginning of April he returned to his country with approximately 180 men provided by the Government of Buenos Aires; on April 11, he issued the Mercedes Proclamation, assumed control of the revolution and on May 18 defeated the Spanish in the Battle of Las Piedras. He then began the siege of Montevideo and was acclaimed as The First Chief of the \\"Orientals\\" (the first names of current Uruguay being Banda Oriental (Eastern Bank) and later Provincia Oriental (Eastern Province), Uruguayans thus refer to themselves as 'Orientales'). He soon turned against the government of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata and in 1814 he organized the Unión de los Pueblos Libres (Union of the Free Peoples), of which he was declared Protector. In the following year, as a federalist, he liberated Montevideo from the centralizing control of the \\"Unitarians\\" from Buenos Aires, and in 1815 declared the Liga Federal. In this Congress Artigas ratified the use of the flag created by Manuel Belgrano (which would later become the flag of the Argentine Republic), but added a diagonal festoon in red, red being the sign of federalism in Argentina at that time. Original member provinces were the present-day Argentinian provinces of: *Córdoba (with La Rioja) *Corrientes *Entre Ríos *Misiones *Eastern Province (Uruguay) *Santa Fe. Downfall The constant growth of influence and prestige of the Federal League frightened Buenos Aires (due to its federalism) and Portugal (because of its republicanism), and in August, 1816 the latter invaded the Eastern Province with the intention of destroying the protector Artigas and his revolution. The Portuguese forces, led by Carlos Frederico Lecor, thanks to his numerical and material superiority, conquered the Eastern Province and took Montevideo on January 20, 1817, but the struggle continued for three long years in the countryside. Infuriated by Buenos Aires's passivity, Artigas declared war on the Supreme Directorship at the same time that he faced the Portuguese with armies that were being decimated by successive defeats. Without resources and without suitable men for the struggle, Artigas finally retreated to Entre Ríos Province, across the Uruguay River. In 1820, governors Francisco Ramírez and Estanislao López, of Entre Ríos and Santa Fe provinces respectively, both members of the Federal League, managed to end victorious the struggle against the centralism of Buenos Aires, defeating a diminished Supreme Directorship army at the Battle of Cepeda and signing a federal agreement with Buenos Aires Province. As these Provinces, and Corrientes Province, rejoined the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, the Federal League effectively came to an end as a separate political entity. The Treaty of Pilar resulted unacceptable to Artigas so he ordered Ramírez and López to renounce it, but they disobeyed. Because of this, Artigas entered into conflict with his former ally governor Francisco Ramírez, who defeated the remnants of Artigas' army. Artigas withdrew to Paraguay, where he settled as an exile until his death. The Eastern Province was annexed by Portugal to its Brazilian dependences in 1821.

This organism is commonly recovered from different monocultured microbial and mixed infections in humans and animals. It is a key component of periodontal plaque due to its abundance and its ability to coaggregate with other bacteria species in the oral cavity. Preterm births Research implicates periodontal disease caused by F. nucleatum with preterm births in humans. In many studies, F. nucleatum cells have been isolated from the amniotic fluid, placenta, and chorioamnionic membranes of women delivering prematurely. Moreover, laboratory mice inoculated (directly into the blood) with F. nucleatum have been found to deliver prematurely, and the pathology of the infection seems to mirror observations in humans. Together, this research provides evidence for a possible causal connection between F. nucleatum-caused periodontal disease and at least some cases of preterm delivery. F. nucleatum can also be isolated from the vaginal microbiome, especially in women with a condition known as bacterial vaginosis. Both F. nucleatum vaginal colonization and bacterial vaginosis also have been linked with preterm birth and infections within the uterus. Thus, preterm birth arising by infections caused by F. nucleatum could also arise from invasive infection into the uterine tissue originating from the colonized vagina. Colon cancer F. nucleatum has a demonstrated association with colon cancer. Fusobacterium species have been found at higher quantities in certain types of colon tumors than in surrounding colon tissue or the colons of healthy individuals, but whether this is an indirect correlation or a causal link is unclear. A distinguishing mechanism has been described by which F. nucleatum creates a pro-inflammatory environment which is conducive to tumor growth through the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, which, unlike other bacteria linked to colorectal carcinoma, does not exacerbate other pathological processes such as colitis, enteritis and inflammatory-associated intestinal carcinogenesis. This suggests direct and specific carcinogenesis.

Knowledge policies can be viewed from a number of perspectives: the necessary linkage to technological evolution, relative rates of technological and institutional change, as a control or regulatory process, obstacles posed by cyberspace, and as an organizational policy instrument. Policies are the paradigms of government and all bureaucracies. Policies provide a context of rules and methods to guide how large organizations meet their responsibilities. Organizational knowledge policies describe the institutional aspects of knowledge creation, management, and use within the context of an organization's mandate or business model. Social knowledge policies balance between progress in the knowledge economy to promote global competitiveness with social values, such as equity, unity, and the well-being of citizens. From a technological perspective, Thomas Jefferson (1816) noted that laws and institutions must keep pace with progress of the human mind. Institutions must advance as new discoveries are made, new truths are discovered, and as opinions and circumstances change. Fast-forwarding to the late 20th century, Martin (1985) stated that any society with a high level of automation must frame its laws and safeguards so that computers can police other computers. Tim Berners-Lee (2000) noted that both policy and technology must be designed with an understanding of the implications of each other. Finally, Sparr (2001) points out that rules will emerge in cyberspace because even on the frontier, pioneers need property rights, standards, and rules of fair play to protect them from pirates. Government is the only entity that can enforce such rules, but they could be developed by others. From a rate of change point of view, McGee and Prusak (1993) note that when an organization changes its culture, information policies are among the last thing to change. From a market perspective, Martin (1996) points out that although cyberspace mechanisms change very rapidly, laws change very slowly, and that some businesses will use this gap for competitive advantage. Similarly, Sparr (2001) observes that governments have the interest and means to govern new areas of technology, but that old laws generally don't cover emerging technologies and new laws take time to create. A number of authors have indicated that it will be very difficult to monitor and regulate cyberspace. Negroponte (1997) uses a metaphor of limiting the freedom of bit radiation is like the Romans attempting to stop Christianity, even though early data broadcasters may be eaten by Washington lions. Brown (1997) questions whether it will even be possible for governments to monitor compliance with regulations in the fact of exponentially increasing encrypted traffic within private networks. As cybernetic environments become central to commercial activity, monitoring electronic markets will become increasingly problematic. From a corporate point of view, Flynn (1956) notes that employee use of corporate computer resources poses liability risks and jeopardizes security and that no organization can afford to engage in electronic communications and e-commerce unprepared. A key attribute of cyberspace is that it is a virtual rather than a real place. Thus, a growing share of social and commercial electronic activity does not have a national physical location (Cozel (1997)), raising a key question of whether legislatures can even set national policies or coordinate international policies. Similarly, Berners-Lee (2000) explains that key criterion of Trademark law – separation in location or market – does not work for World-Wide Web domain names because the Internet crosses all geographic boundaries and has no concept of a market area. From an organizational perspective, Simard (2000) states that \\"if traditional policies are applied directly [to a digital environment], the Canadian Forest Service could become marginalized in a dynamic knowledge-based economy.\\" Consequently, the CFS developed and implemented an Access to Knowledge Policy that \\"fosters the migration of the CFS towards providing free, open access to its knowledge assets, while recognizing the need for cost recovery and the need to impose restrictions on access in some cases\\" (Simard, 2005). The policy comprises a framework of objectives, guiding principles, staff responsibilities, and policy directives. The directives include: ownership and use; roles, rights, and responsibilities; levels of access and accessibility; service to clients; and cost of access.

He received the various rabbinical degrees (that of \\"morenu\\" in 1846) at the celebrated bet ha-midrash Ets Haim. In 1848 he was awarded the royal gold medal for the best sermon in the Dutch language. When the Sephardic synagogue of Amsterdam proposed to elect him preacher in the vernacular, it met with strenuous opposition, Ladino being the only language, except Hebrew, used in the synagogue. When in 1852 Chumaceiro was elected first ab bet din, he succeeded in overcoming the opposition to Dutch, and soon established a reputation as one of the foremost pulpit orators in the Netherlands. In 1852 he edited the first Dutch Jewish weekly, Het Israelietisch Weekblad. In the same year he was elected head of the bet ha-midrash Ets Haim. Delegated by the parnasim (officials of the synagogue) of his congregation in 1854 to receive the future King Pedro V of Portugal, he conducted the royal visitor and his suite to the bet ha-midrash, where the king, noticing the names of the donors to that institution inscribed on the walls, made the significant remark: \\"Me faz pareçer que estoy em mea propia terra do Portugal\\" (It seems as though I were in my own land of Portugal). When Pedro V ascended the throne in 1856, he removed the civil disabilities of the Jews. On account of his liberal- conservative views Chumaceiro was strongly opposed by the ultra-Orthodox party, and he therefore accepted in 1855 from King William III the appointment of chief rabbi of the colony of Curaçao. At the solicitation of the special ambassador, O. van Rees, who was sent by the king to adjust the claims of the persecuted Dutch Jews of Coro, Venezuela, he succeeded in settling the complicated disputes to the entire satisfaction of the contending parties. Chumaceiro visited his birthplace in 1861, when the office of chakam was tendered to him, which he declined, receiving on that occasion a costly testimonial from the Sephardic synagogue. He obtained his discharge as chakam of Curaçao in 1869, and received a liberal pension from the king for \\"the numerous and faithful services rendered to his country.\\" Chumaceiro had four sons: #Abraham Mendes Chumaceiro: Attorney at law; born at Amsterdam November 16, 1841; died at Curaçao, Dutch West Indies, August 19, 1902. He moved to Curaçao in 1856, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1872. He soon acquired great prominence in his profession. Among his literary works are Is Curaçao te Koop? and Het Kiesrecht in de Kolonie Curaçao. #Benjamin Mendes Chumaceiro: Cantor; born in Amsterdam in 1871. He received a ministerial training at the bet ha-midrash Ets Haim of Amsterdam. In 1892 he was elected assistant cantor of the Portuguese synagogue at The Hague; and in 1895 cantor of that of Hamburg. #Jacob Mendes Chumaceiro: Dayyan and editor; born at Amsterdam March 11, 1833; died February 8, 1900. Besides being dayyan of the Sephardic synagogue, and acting chakam for the Portuguese Jews of North and South Netherlands, he was inspector of the Jewish schools of Amsterdam, head and librarian of the bet ha-midrash Ets Haim, and editor of Het Israelietisch Weekblad. #Joseph Chayyim Mendes Chumaceiro: Rabbi and editor; born in Amsterdam July 3, 1844. He studied for the ministry under his father at Curaçao. From 1867 to 1874 he was rabbi of Beth-El congregation, Charleston, South Carolina; from 1874 to 1880, of Nefashot Yebudah, New Orleans, Louisiana; from 1884 to 1887, of Beth-El Emeth, Philadelphia; from 1889 to 1891, of Mikwe Yisrael, Curaçao; from 1892 to 1898, of Children of Israel, Augusta, Georgia; and was recalled as rabbi to Curaçao in 1898. During part (1879–83) of his residence at New Orleans he was also editor of The Jewish South, a weekly journal. Besides many sermons and discourses, he published The Evidences of Free-Masonry from Ancient Hebrew Records, 1900, which reached a third edition; La Revelacion, the first Jewish catechism in Spanish; and Verdediging is geen Aanval, a correspondence between a Christian divine and a rabbi on Jesus as the Messiah.

He is son to Derek Trotter and Raquel Turner. Damien is the only child of Del and Raquel and nephew of Rodney Trotter. A recurring theme in the show was Rodney's fixated belief that Damien was literally the Antichrist (an allusion to the Damien Thorn character from the Omen series of films) despite the fact that Damien shows no resentment nor intentions of harm toward anybody except Rodney himself. Del and Raquel chide Rodney for his mad obsessions and believe Damien to be a perfect angel, spoiling him frequently. From the earliest ages, Damien shows signs of being a spoiled brat, such as throwing things at Rodney, throwing seeds on the floor, deliberately waking Uncle Albert up from a nap, placing Cassandra's birth control pills inside an urn containing Albert's ashes, urinating in a public swimming pool (from the top of the diving board), encouraging his father to physically fight someone at a funeral, and even hoping that his father might get sent to prison merely to fit in with his group of friends with imprisoned fathers. Although Del and Raquel seemed to remain oblivious to Damien's bad behaviour when he was younger, they did gradually become stricter with him in the final episodes and Rodney frequently calls him or refers to him as \\"Rat Boy\\". He was named after Del and Raquel could not decide on a name for their unborn baby (Raquel thought of Aron, pronounced \\"air-on\\", but Uncle Albert thought the kids would nickname him \\"Aron a G-string\\" and Del thought Troy, but the name Troy Trotter was instantly dismissed), so Rodney sarcastically suggested that they name him \\"Damien\\" as Rodney was convinced that the baby would be born half-demon. To his horror, they adored the name and Rodney desperately tried to get them to change their minds, offering the name Derek which led to his middle name (and resulting in the initials D. D. T.) Damien was born under a full moon and during the birth, Rodney even went as so far as to ask Del if the baby had been born with the numbers \\"666\\" branded on its forehead. After Damien was born, Rodney refused to hold him or share a room with him. In episodes when Damien was a child, Rodney seemed more relaxed around him but his fear arose again when Damien became a handsome and popular teenager who delighted in tormenting Rodney. Sometimes it became somewhat apparent that Del Boy enjoyed Rodney's fear of Damien, and on Rodney's birthday once, Damien \\"sent\\" him a card with the Devil on it. Cassandra shares Rodney's view that Damien is the Antichrist and like Rodney she is tormented by Damien (such as spying on her whilst she was showering and hiding her birth control pills in the urn containing Albert's ashes).

The film's title was changed to All That Money Can Buy to avoid confusion with another film released by RKO that year, The Devil and Miss Jones, but later had the title restored on some prints. It has also been released under the titles Mr. Scratch, Daniel and the Devil and Here Is a Man. The film stars Edward Arnold, Walter Huston, and James Craig. A retelling of the Faust legend, set in 1840s rural New Hampshire, it was directed by German- born actor-director William Dieterle who (under his original name, Wilhelm Dieterle) played a featured role in F. W. Murnau's epic silent version of Faust in 1926. Plot In 1840 New Hampshire, Jabez Stone, a poor kindhearted farmer, is broke and plagued by bad luck. After a series of mishaps, he impulsively declares that he would sell his soul to the devil for two cents, and moments later the devil appears, calling himself \\"Mr. Scratch\\". He appears to offer Jabez a bargain: sell his soul in return for seven years of good luck and prosperity. Scratch tempts Jabez by magically revealing a hoard of Hessian gold coins, which appears from under the barn floor, and, unable to resist the lure of the gold, Jabez signs the contract. He begins his new life with hope, paying off his debts and buying new tools and supplies. While the women are shopping, Jabez meets and becomes friends with the celebrated Massachusetts Congressman and orator Daniel Webster, a friend of his wife's family, and a widely loved figure who champions the cause of the poor farmers. Webster himself is being tempted by Mr. Scratch to sell his soul, in return for fulfilling his ambition to become President of the United States. As time passes, Jabez's increasing wealth begins to change him. He ensnares his desperate neighbors with onerous financial contracts, and he slowly alienates his devoted wife Mary and his pious mother. Later, as the townspeople celebrate the harvest in Jabez's barn, Mary gives birth to their first child, whom they name Daniel in honor of Mr. Webster, but minutes later, Jabez discovers that the local girl they had hired as a maid has vanished. In her place, he finds the beautiful and sinister Belle who has been sent by Mr. Scratch. She bewitches Jabez, driving a wedge between him and Mary. As Daniel grows, he too falls under Belle's malign influence, and she turns him into a spoiled, disobedient brat. In a few more years, Jabez is one of the richest men in the country: he has built a lavish mansion and throws a huge ball, but it ends in disaster: after a nightmarish dance between Belle and Miser Stephens, Jabez finds Stephens dead on the floor. He, too, had signed a pact with Mr. Scratch and his time was up. Now desperate and realizing that his own time is almost up, Jabez tries to erase the deadline Mr. Scratch has burned into the tree outside the barn, but Scratch appears and again tempts Jabez, offering to extend his deal in return for the soul of his son. Horrified, Jabez flees and chases after Mary. He begs her forgiveness and pleads with Webster to help him find some way out of his bargain with the devil. Webster agrees to take his case. Mr. Scratch again offers an extension in exchange for Jabez's son, but Jabez turns him down. He then begs Webster to leave before it is too late, but Webster refuses to go. The real Daniel Webster. When Mr. Scratch shows up to claim his due, Webster has to wager his own soul before his fiendish opponent will agree to a trial by jury. Mr. Scratch chooses the jury members from among the most notorious personalities of American history (including Benedict Arnold) with John Hathorne (one of the magistrates of the Salem witch trials) as the judge. Webster begins by stating that he envies the jury because, as Americans, they were present at the birth of a nation, but they were fooled like Jabez Stone, trapped in their desire to rebel against their fate. Webster explains that it is the eternal right of everyone, including the jury, to raise their fists against their fates. They took the wrong turn, just as Stone did, but Stone's soul can be saved. After a few moments, Hathorne asks the jury for their verdict and, in response, the foreman, Arnold, tears up the contract, releasing Jabez from his deal. Webster then kicks Mr Scratch out, but, as he is ejected, the fiend promises that Webster will never fulfill his ambition to become President. Scratch sits alone, resignedly thumbing through a notebook. He puts it away and then breaks the fourth wall, moving his gaze until he stops, looks straight ahead and points wordlessly at the viewer. CastProduction After the success of The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939), William Dieterle founded his own production company and signed a contract with RKO Radio Pictures, the studio that had produced the film. He decided to adapt Stephen Vincent Benet's short story of the same name as the first film he would make under the contract with the studio. The story had been adapted to the stage in 1939 at the Martin Beck Theater to great acclaim, but only ran for six performances because the production proved to be expensive. It was also later adapted as an opera that was performed during World War II by USO troupes. Benet was invited to write the script for the film adaptation, along with Dan Totheroh, the younger brother of Roland Totheroh, who worked as Charlie Chaplin's top cinematographer from his silent short films to Monsieur Verdoux (1947). There were some differences between the short story and the film. In the original story, Webster regrets Benedict Arnold's absence; in the film, Arnold is present and Webster objects, citing him as a traitor and therefore not a true American, but his objection is dismissed by the judge, and Asa the Black Monk is made up for the film, along with John Smeet, who appears in a deleted scene. The writers also cut out Scratch's other predictions involving Webster's last speech and his sons' deaths in the Civil War. Mr Scratch, Walter Huston's character, was more soft-spoken in the story and the character of Belle was an addition. Thomas Mitchell was the original choice for Daniel Webster, but he suffered a skull fracture while filming the carriage scene and was replaced by Edward Arnold. Bernard Herrmann was chosen to compose the film, having composed music for Charles R. Jackson's 1938 radio adaptation that had aired on The Columbia Workshop. Herrmann was introduced to the cast and crew by Dieterle, whom he found to be a very sophisticated director. In addition to his original music score, Herrmann also incorporated several traditional folk tunes, including \\"Devil's Dream\\", \\"Springfield Mountain\\", and a diabolical version of \\"Pop Goes The Weasel\\" played on the fiddle by Mr. Scratch. Herrmann collaborated with sound engineer James G. Stewart to ensure the music and sound worked well together. To create the creepy sound when Mr. Scratch first appeared in the barn, Herrmann had a recording crew go to San Fernando to record the sound of telephone wires. Alternative versions The original release was 107 minutes long. It was a critical, but not a box- office, success, recording a loss of $53,000 on its initial run.Richard Jewell & Vernon Harbin, The RKO Story. New Rochelle, New York: Arlington House, 1982. p. 166 It was later re-released under the title The Devil and Daniel Webster, reducing the film to 85 minutes. The cuts were crudely done. The film was restored to its full-length in the 1990s and has been issued in that form on home video. However, the title has remained The Devil and Daniel Webster. The restored portions on the video had been taken from inferior prints of the movie, but the quality has since improved. A preview print titled Here Is a Man was found in the estate of the director and served as the basis for the film's restoration and DVD release. Parodies The Simpsons featured a comedic spoof of \\"The Devil and Daniel Webster\\" in \\"Treehouse of Horror IV\\" (1993). It was called \\"The Devil and Homer Simpson\\" and it included a court case including “American betrayers” which included the 1976 Philadelphia Flyers. The devil was played by Ned Flanders. Awards and honors Bernard Herrmann won the Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic Picture and Walter Huston was nominated for Academy Award for Best Actor.

A bilge keel is a nautical device used to reduce a ship's tendency to roll. Bilge keels are employed in pairs (one for each side of the ship). A ship may have more than one bilge keel per side, but this is rare. Bilge keels increase hydrodynamic resistance to rolling, making the ship roll less. Bilge keels are passive stability systems. On commercial shipping the bilge keel is in the form of a strake, or small keel or blister, running along much of the length of the hull. They are typically fitted one on each side, low down on the side of the hull, so as not to increase the draft of the vessel. In battleships they were often quite large and used as part of the torpedo protection system. A bilge keel is often in a \\"V\\" shape, welded along the length of the ship at the turn of the bilge. Although not as effective as stabilizing fins, bilge keels have a major advantage in their low impact on internal ship arrangements. Unlike fins, bilge keels do not have any components inside the hull that would adversely affect cargo or mission spaces. Like fins, bilge keels have the disadvantage of increasing the hydrodynamic resistance of the vessel, thus hindering forward motion. Design considerations When designing a bilge keel there are important decisions to consider. To minimize hydrodynamic drag the bilge keel should be placed in way of a flowline where it does not oppose crossflow. For such a usage the ends of the bilge keel should be tapered and properly faired into the hull. Also, a bilge keel should not protrude from the hull so far that the device could be damaged when the vessel is alongside a pier, even with a few degrees of adverse heel. Bilge keels on commercial vessels should not protrude below the baseline either, where they could be damaged or fouled by grounding. Note that small bilge keels are often fitted to smaller fishing boats precisely to protect the hull on drying moorings and to help keep the vessel upright. Effectiveness A bilge keel is constructed from flat plate so as to present a sharp obstruction to roll motion. The roll damping provided by a bilge keel is more than that of a barehull ship, but falls short of other roll damping devices. Nevertheless it is considered prudent naval architecture to install a bilge keel whenever possible as it is the only device effective in the severest of seas. Bilge keels can also be used in conjunction with other roll damping devices. On sailing yachts Bilge keels are often fitted to smaller sailing yachts. Bilge keels minimise the draft of the vessel compared to a single fin keel thus enabling it to negotiate shallower water. Bilge keels on sailing yachts extend below the lowest point of the hull extending slightly outwards. Such an arrangement also enables the vessel to stand upright on firm sand or mud at drying moorings without the need for detachable legs, and is simpler than retractable fin keels while giving the hull greater protection. Bilge keels are not as effective as central fin keels in preventing leeway (sideways slippage) caused by crosswinds but are preferred by many small craft owners due to their other advantages.

The interface between these two fields is sometimes referred to as particle cosmology. Particle physics must be taken into account in cosmological models of the early universe, when the average energy density was very high. The processes of particle pair production, scattering and decay influence the cosmology. As a rough approximation, a particle scattering or decay process is important at a particular cosmological epoch if its time scale is shorter than or similar to the time scale of the universe's expansion. The latter quantity is \\\\frac{1}{H} where H is the time-dependent Hubble parameter. This is roughly equal to the age of the universe at that time. For example, the pion has a mean lifetime to decay of about 26 nanoseconds. This means that particle physics processes involving pion decay can be neglected until roughly that much time has passed since the Big Bang. Cosmological observations of phenomena such as the cosmic microwave background and the cosmic abundance of elements, together with the predictions of the Standard Model of particle physics, place constraints on the physical conditions in the early universe. The success of the Standard Model at explaining these observations support its validity under conditions beyond those which can be produced in a laboratory. Conversely, phenomena discovered through cosmological observations, such as dark matter and baryon asymmetry, suggest the presence of physics that goes beyond the Standard Model.

The theorem is part of the Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence. Historically, the third theorem referred to a different but related result. The two preceding theorems of Sophus Lie, restated in modern language, relate to the infinitesimal transformations of a group action on a smooth manifold. The third theorem on the list stated the Jacobi identity for the infinitesimal transformations of a local Lie group. Conversely, in the presence of a Lie algebra of vector fields, integration gives a local Lie group action. The result now known as the third theorem provides an intrinsic and global converse to the original theorem.  Cartan's theorem  The equivalence between the category of simply connected real Lie groups and finite- dimensional real Lie algebras is called usually (in the literature of the second half of 20th century) Cartan's or Cartan-Lie theorem as it is proved by Élie Cartan whereas S. Lie has proved earlier just the infinitesimal version (local solvability of Maurer-Cartan equations (see Maurer-Cartan form) or the equivalence between the category of finite-dimensional Lie algebras and the category of local Lie groups). Lie listed his results as three direct and three converse theorems. The infinitesimal variant of Cartan's theorem was essentially Lie's third converse theorem. In an influential bookJean-Pierre Serre (1992)[1965] Lie Algebras and Lie Groups: 1964 Lectures Given at Harvard University, page 152, Springer Jean-Pierre Serre called it the third theorem of Lie. The name is historically somewhat misleading, but often used in connection to generalizations. Serre provided two proofs in his book: one based on Ado's theorem and another recounting the proof by Élie Cartan.
