It was released by Pair Records in 1994 and consists of 20 tracks taken from five of the six albums Newton recorded for RCA. Overview Juice Newton began her recording career with RCA Records in 1975 as the lead singer and a guitar player for the band Juice Newton & Silver Spur. Her two albums with the label ‚Äì Juice Newton & Silver Spur and After the Dust Settles ‚Äì met with little success and the label dropped her band. Newton then moved to Capitol Records and eventually made her \\"breakthrough\\" in 1981 with Juice, an album that reach number 22 on the Billboard 200 chart and number 16 on the Canadian Top 50 album chart. The album gave Newton three hit singles, beginning with \\"Angel of the Morning\\" which peaked at number four on the pop charts and number 22 on the country charts. Her second single from the album, \\"Queen of Hearts\\", reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 14 on the country charts. The final single from Juice, \\"The Sweetest Thing (I've Ever Known)\\", peaked at number one on the country chart and number seven on the pop chart. Newton followed up Juice with Quiet Lies (1982), another hit album that reached number 20 on the Billboard 200. This album also had three hit singles released from its track lineup. The first, \\"Love's Been a Little Bit Hard on Me\\", reached #7 on the Billboard pop chart, #30 on the country chart, and #4 on the AC chart. The second, \\"Break It to Me Gently\\", hit the pop chart at #11, AC #1, and the country chart at #2. It also won her the Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Female. The final single from Quiet Lies was \\"Heart of the Night\\". It reached #4 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary Chart and #25 on the Hot 100. Newton's next album, Dirty Looks (1983), was not as successful as Juice and Quiet Lies. However, it sold well enough in Canada to be certified Gold on October 1, 1983, by the Canadian Music Industry. The three singles released from this album were \\"Tell Her No\\", \\"Dirty Looks\\", and \\"Stranger at My Door\\". The first two peaked on the pop chart at, respectively, #27 and #90. The third peaked on the country chart at #45. In 1984 Newton returned to RCA and moved more into country music with the release of Can't Wait All Night. Her next album, Old Flame, peaked at number 12 on the Billboard album chart. \\"You Make Me Want to Make You Mine\\" was the album's lead-off single and went to number one on the Billboard Country chart. It was also her first top ten hit in three years. This was followed by \\"Hurt\\" which also went to number one on Billboard's chart. \\"Old Flame\\" and \\"Cheap Love\\", the next two singles to be released, peaked at number five and number nine, respectively. \\"What Can I Do with My Heart\\", the album's final single release was written by Newton's long-time collaborator Otha Young and also peaked at number nine. \\"Both to Each Other (Friends & Lovers)\\", a duet by Newton and Eddie Rabbitt, was released as a single in July 1985 and peaked at number one. This song was not included in the original release of Old Flame but was added to CD reissues. Emotion (1987) was the last of Newton's albums to appear on Billboard's Top Country album chart and peaked at number 59. The album had two single releases. \\"First Time Caller\\" peaked at number 24 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart while \\"Tell Me True\\" peaked at number 8 on the same chart. Also featured on the album are \\"Emotions\\" and \\"'Til You Cry\\". After one more album, Ain't Gonna Cry (1989), Newton abandoned recording and concentrated on raising her children and performing in nightclubs. Pair Records compilation Emotions was released on February 7, 1994, by Pair Records, a budget label that specialized in compilations released as double albums with music licensed from various labels. For this CD Pair licensed 20 songs from five of Newton's RCA albums. Thus none of the hits from her Capitol releases are included. Two song's from her debut album, Juice Newton & Silver Spur (1975) are included along with three from her second release, After the Dust Settles. The largest number of songs came from Old Flame with a total of seven songs. Three songs were derived from Can't Wait All Night and four from the similar-named Emotion. In his liner notes for Emotions music critic Rich Kienzel noted that: :In the early nineties, when many younger country artists like Mary-Chapin Carpenter have folk or rock roots, Newton was the first to emerge from such a background. Today, a new younger generation of country artists are treading musical ground Juice Newton help to break years ago.

History The term was coined in the early twentieth century.'Persian Poetry', in The Princeton Handbook of World Poetries, ed. by Roland Greene and Stephen Cushman (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2017), p. 419. It is traditionally considered to characterise the first period of New Persian poetry, running from the ninth century CE into the second half of the twelfth. It is characterized by its plain poetic technique, concrete images and metaphors, and some archaic linguistic features. While showing limited use of Arabic loan-words, poetry in this style was influenced by Arabic verse, particularly in terms of its prosody, and the dominant genre was the praise-poem.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), p. 20; Angela Sadeghi Tehrani, 'Modernist Poetry in Iran and the Pioneers', Asian Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies, 2.7 (July 2014), 167-69 (p. 167). The KhurƒÅsƒÅnƒ´ period was succeeded by the sabk-i ‚ÄòIrƒÅqƒ´ ('style of Iraq'), with its greater use of Arabisms, more elaborate metaphors and imagery, and turn towards spiritualism.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), p. 20. However, the transition between the periods was not a sharp one.Asghar Seyed-Gohrab, 'Stylistic Continuities in Classical Persian Poetry: Reflections on Manuchehri from DƒÅmghƒÅn and Amir Mo‚Äòezzi', in The Age of the Seljuqs, ed. by Edmund Herzig and Sarah Stewart, The Idea of Iran, 6 (I. B. Tauris). The style saw a return to popularity with the so-called literary revival (bazgasht-e adabi) of the eighteenth to twentieth centuries.Angela Sadeghi Tehrani, 'Modernist Poetry in Iran and the Pioneers', Asian Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies, 2.7 (July 2014), 167-69 (p. 168). Exponents The pre-eminent study of the style was by Mu·∏•ammad Ja ªfar Ma·∏•j≈´b in 1971.Sabk-i KhurƒÅsƒÅnƒ´ dar shi ªr-i FƒÅrsƒ´ : barrasƒ´-i mukhta·π£·π£ƒÅt-i sabkƒ´-i shi ªr-i FƒÅrsƒ´ az ƒÅghƒÅz-i ·∫ìuh≈´r tƒÅ pƒÅyƒÅn-i qarn-i panjum hijrƒ´ [The Khorasani style in Persian poetry: studies of the stylistic character of Persian poetry from its origins to the end of the fifth century of the Hegira] ([TihrƒÅn]: IntishƒÅrƒÅt-i Firdaws, 199-? [first publ. 1971]). The chief representatives of this lyricism are Asjadi, Farrukhi Sistani, Unsuri, and Manuchehri. Panegyric masters such as Rudaki were known for their love of nature, their verse abounding with evocative descriptions. Example A. A. Seyed-Gohrab contrasts the following passages to illustrate the KhorƒÅsƒÅnƒ´ style.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 39-42, drawing on Julie Scott Meisami, 'Palaces and Paradises: Palace Description in Medieval Persian Poetry', in Islamic Art and Literature, ed. by O. Grabar and C. Robinson (Princeton, 2001), pp. 21-54. The first is a description of a palace from Qa·π£ƒ´da 31 by Farrukhƒ´ SistƒÅnƒ´, writing in the earlier eleventh century. It is plain and concrete in its description: > : There was a kingly palace in the middle of the garden : The top of the > parapets was situated between two turrets : Within the palace, there were > decorated porticoes : Each opening towards a belvedere : One was adorned > like Chinese brocade : The other contained pictures as in Mani's Artang : In > this palace, the images of the King of the East : Were carved/painted in > several places: : In one place, he is fighting, holding in his hand a small > javelin : In another place, he is feasting, holding in his hand a cup of > wine. The second is from the end of the sabk-i KhurƒÅsƒÅnƒ´ period, near to the sabk-i ‚ÄòIrƒÅqƒ´ period: a description of a palace built by ArslƒÅn Shah of Ghazna, composed by ‚ÄòUthmƒÅn MukhtƒÅrƒ´ in the vicinity of 1100. This description is far less concrete and much more spiritual in tone: > : The ancient sphere established the centre of the world's empire : Through > this place, through which Jupiter exercises its heavenly influence. : When > the sun saw its parapets from the sky, : It bowed its head to the ground, > and its eyes to the threshold. : [When] the virgins of paradise beheld it > from their gardens, : They took this palace for gold, and paradise as the > mine. : They considered the earth insignificant because of its firm > structure; : The air in this palace was so fine that the air (outside) was > heavy. : The architect used his intellect and soul to design this edifice : > Through the firmness of his intellect and the grace of his soul.

She was a country ship that made several voyages for the British East India Company (EIC) before the Royal Navy purchased her in 1804 to use as a fifth-rate frigate, and renamed Duncan. In 1807 the Navy renamed her Dover. She was wrecked off Madras on 2 May 1811. EIC voyages Carron made several voyages for the EIC. In 1795 Captain Francis Simpson sailed from Bengal for China, and then for Britain. Carron was at Whampoa on 24 November 1795, crossed the Second Bar on 11 January 1796, and left China on 15 February. She reached Saint Helena on 5 May, and arrived at Long Reach on 8 August.British Library: Carron. Carron was admitted to the Registry in Great Britain on 23 November 1796. Simpson received a letter of marque on 25 November.\\"Register of Letters of Marque against France 1793-1815\\"; p.55 He then sailed for China and Bengal on 27 November.

Courier and Evening Gazette (London, England), 24 August 1797; Issue 1577. In 1799 Simpson sailed from China for Britain. Carron was at Lintin on 9 February 1799, and at Malacca on 22 February. She reached St Helena on 11 May, and arrived at The Downs in July. She then returned to Bombay, leaving Britain on 13 February 1800. When she left England she was in company with Cuvera, , and Minerva. She returned from Bombay on 17 June 1801. Carron sailed from Portsmouth on 9 September 1801. She was part of a convoy under escort by that also included , , , , , , Caledonia, , , , Elizabeth, , and . The convoy reached Madeira on 23 September, and left the next day.Lloyd's List, no. 4200. On 14 February 1804 Carron was one of 11 country ships present at the Battle of Pulo Aura, though she took no part in the engagement. She, like the rest of the flotilla of East Indiamen and country ships, was coming back from China. HMS Duncan Rear- Admiral Edward Pellew, took up the post of Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Station in 1805. He purchased Carron that year and named her HMS Duncan. Initially she was under the command of Lieutenant Clement Sneyd (acting). Under his command she captured a number of French vessels. On 11 October Duncan captured the French sloop Pincon, of 30 tons, which was sailing from Madagascar to a port north-west, when Duncan took her off St Dennis and destroyed her at sea; Prior to 7 November Duncan captured Emilie, a French privateer, after an engagement off R√©union. On 7 November, as Duncan was sailing into the main anchorage at Mah√©, Seychelles, Sneyd observed a strange sail anchored between the islands of Th√©r√®se and Conception and sent Emilie to investigate. On 9 November Emilie rejoined Duncan, having with her the French brig Courier, of 280 tons, fitted as a slaver. Courier (or Courier des Seycelles) was based in the Seychelles and the governor, Jean Baptiste Qu√©au de Quincy, protested to Sneyd that it was one of the vessels that the capitulation of the Seychelles exempted from seizure.In 1794, when the first British warships arrived at the Seychelles, Quncy (or Quinssy), did not offer any resistance. Instead, he successfully negotiated a capitulation to Britain that gave the settlers a privileged position of neutrality. As soon as the captain of Courier des Seychelles saw Duncan and Emilie, he hid on shore the 200 slaves that he had been carrying. He also hid his all his cables and anchors. Sneyd sent search parties that succeeded in despoiling the homes of owners of Courier des Seychellles, and bringing back her sails, cables and anchors. However, not only did they not find the 200 slaves, but four British sailors deserted, with their weapons, and also could not be found. While at Mah√©, Duncans crew captured the French brig Sirius, of 80 tons (bm), carrying a cargo of gum, rosin, and plank, French brig of unknown name, of 90 tons (bm). This brig the British burned. Sneyd sent his men on punitive raids along the west coast. They fired on and forced to run aground at Anse Boileau a brig coming from Madagascar. They also found and set on fire Rosalie, a small vessel undergoing repairs at Anse √° la Mouche. It is possible that Sirius was the brig coming from Madagascar, and Rosalie the brig of 90 tons. Sneyd and Duncan stayed less than a week at Mah√© before sailing off with Emilie and Courier des Seychelles. On 27 November Duncan captured the French schooner Cacotte, of 70 tons (bm), pierced for eight guns but only carrying four. She was carrying cocoa nuts when Duncan captured her off Diego Garcia. Lieutenant Charles Hawtayne (acting) replaced Sneyd. Not long thereafter Pellew appointed Hawtayne governor of the naval hospital at Madras. Captain Lord George Stuart replaced him as captain of Duncan. On 8 April 1806 Duncan captured the French privateer √éle de France, of 8 guns and 71 men, at sea and destroyed her. Head money was paid in November 1827 for 69 men. In June 1806 Duncan, still under Stuart's command, returned to Mah√©. This time Quincy quickly arranged a renewal of the capitulation with Stuart. A few days later the 74-gun joined Duncan. Both vessels stayed only a few days to replenish their water and provisions before sailing off. This time too, some four crew members from Duncan took the opportunity to desert successfully. HMS Dover In 1807 Duncan was registered with the Admiralty (on 24 March), and received the name HMS Dover. In the summer, Stuart was appointed to . Captain Edward Tucker replaced Stuart on Dover. In February 1810 Captain Tucker commanded a small squadron comprising Dover, the frigate , and the sloop Samarang. Their objective was the island of Amboyna. On their way, on 6 February Dover captured the Dutch brig-of-war Rambang. The British launched their attack on 16 February, capturing one battery that overlooked the port, the city of Ambon, and Fort Victoria. They then took another battery. During the night, Samarang landed forty men, who were joined by two field pieces from Dover. These joined in the bombardment of Fort Victoria from the two captured batteries. On 18 February the town capitulated. British casualties were extremely light, with only three dead, one of whom was a marine from Samarang.James (1837), Vol. 5, pp.314-6. During the campaign the British captured several Dutch vessels. One was the Dutch brig Mandurese, Captain Guasteranus. She had 12 guns. She was one of three vessels sunk in the inner harbor of Amboyna. However, the British raised her after the island surrendered. They took her into service as . From Amboyna, the squadron went on to capture the islands of Saparua, Harouka, Nasso-Laut, Buru, and Manipa. After the attack on Amboyna, Samarang captured the Dutch brig Recruiter on 28 March. Samarang shared the prize money by agreement with Dover and Cornwallis. Between 29 April and 18 May, Dover, Cornwallis, and Samarang captured Engelina and Koukiko. On 26 June Dover captured the island of Manado. Fate Dover was at Madras Roads on 1 May 1811 undergoing a refit when a major gale struck. She was at anchor, with topmasts struck and foreyard lowered. Tucker had gone ashore and so she was under the command of Lieutenant Charles Jeffries. Although Jeffries dropped a second anchor and later a bower anchor after her anchor cable parted, a sudden squall drove her into the northeast corner of Fort Saint George during the night of 2 May. Despite attempts to save her, the storm battered her against the fort's walls until she foundered. Two men drowned. The violent gale also claimed the transport Chichester, several merchant vessels, and some 70 small craft.

Voronin married Quisling in August 1922, the day after her 17th birthday, at a Registry office in Kharkov, and then travelled to Moscow for the issuing of documents at the Norwegian legation, including her name being added to Quisling‚Äôs passport.In Quisling's Shadow (1999), Chapter 8 In March 1923, Voronin was pregnant, and Quisling insisted on her having an abortion, which greatly distressed her.In Quisling's Shadow (1999), Chapter 14, ‚ÄúThe Child‚Äù They made a short trip to Norway, then returned to Kharkov, where Quisling may bigamously have married Maria Pasetshnikova, without divorcing Voronin. In the summer of 1924, the three returned together to Norway, where Vidkun Quisling began to refer to Voronin as his \\"foster daughter\\", instead of his wife, as before. Alexandra Voronin subsequently left Norway to live with an aunt in Nice and never returned.H. F. Dahl, Quisling: A Study in Treachery (Cambridge University Press, 1999, ), pp. 54‚Äì56 Later life In 1929, Quisling broke off all contact with Voronin, and she migrated to China. There, in 1933, the Russian Orthodox Archbishop of China annulled her marriage to Quisling, so that she could marry Dr. J. P. Ryabin. They had one son. Her second husband died in an accident in 1936, and the same year she met and married W. George Yourieff, a Russian architect and honorary French consul in Tsingtao, whom she had known since her youth. In 1947, they migrated together to the United States and settled in Palo Alto, California.Inventory of the Alexandra Andreevna Voronine Yourieff Papers at oac.cdlib.org, accessed 1 October 2020 Eventually they wrote a book about Voronin‚Äôs life with Vidkun Quisling.

A translation of Harivamsa was unfinished at his death. Biography Buck was born in Washington, D.C., one of six children of U.S. Congressman Frank H. Buck. He had a sister and four half-siblings. He was a member of the wealthy Buck family of Marin County, California. His great-grandfather was Leonard W. Buck, a politician and businessman. His father died in Washington, D.C. in 1942 while still in office. His mother, Eva Benson Buck, was born to Swedish parents and was Buck's second wife. After her husband's death, she moved back to Vacaville, California with William and his younger sister Carol Franc Buck, who grew up at the family's mansion at 225 Buck Ave. According to the publisher's preface to the 2012 republication of Buck's translations of Mahabharata and Ramayana, Buck was in 1955 inspired by reading a 19th-century translation of Bhagavad Gita, in a state library in Carson City, Nevada. He discovered that a proposed 11-volume Indian publication of Mahabharata was at risk for lack of funds, and subsidized it. He began to study Sanskrit, and to make his own translations. He later wrote: Buck's translations have been praised by Levi Asher and others.

However, proportionately to men, their representation and recognition -especially at higher levels- falls a long way below their numbers. Although women have not had roles in symphony orchestras until recently, it has been much more common for women to study musical instruments. In the 1800s, upper-class women often were expected to learn an instrument, often the harp, piano, guitar, or violin, or to learn to sing. Women have also performed in the soloist setting more frequently in recent years. Pianist (and composer) Clara Schumann and vocalist Jenny Lind were two rarer examples prominent in the nineteenth-century.  History  Hildegard of Bingen One of the first historically recorded women in medieval music was Hildegard of Bingen, who wrote religious songs in the 12th century. Women have also been necessary for the functioning of choirs, which require the upper register that women can sing, although Pope Leo IV (847‚Äì855 A.D.) banned women in choirs from singing in churches, and Pope Pius X banned women from church choirs in 1907. Antonio Vivaldi led an all-girl orchestra in 1714 at a school for girls. Historically, women were expected to master instruments along with learning music basics such as reading music, writing music, and performing it. However, until the 20th century, it was seen as immoral to perform publicly and women were only expected to play in the private domestic setting . Until recently, women were not allowed to be taught at a conservatory level and were tracked into a less demanding curriculum that omitted topics that were considered complex. These subjects were composition, counterpoint, and orchestration. Women are even less encouraged to compose than perform it.The professional status of women composers was influenced by their family and marital status. Women who came from musical families and had the support of their husband and their father could make a name for themselves. A prominent example is Elisabeth Jacquet da la Guerre. Elisabeth Jacquet da la Guerre was a French composer born on March 17th, 1665. Her grandfather, Jehan Jacquet, and her father, Claude Jacquet, were harpsichord makers. Guerre came from a rich family of masons, musicians, composers, and instrument makers. Rather than just teaching his sons, Claude Jacquet taught both his sons and daughters how to survive and thrive in the world. This upbringing, support from her father, and her family‚Äôs rich history of musicianship was a major stepping stone for her musical career. At the age of five, Louis XIV took notice of her when she performed at his palace of Versailles. This eventually led to her becoming a musician in the court of the Sun King, Louis XIV. She wrote most of her works for her king, which was common. In 1694, when she premiered her only published opera, it only had 5 or 6 performances. An explanation of this failure was how the opera depended on the text rather than the music. Cephale et Procris would soon be known as tragedie en musique, a tragedy put into music and French literary theatre recited musically . Her compositions were not received well by the French musical culture that was cautious about contemporary opera. It would have been accepted easier in Italy due to all the innovations occurring to the music. But in France, tradition was considered necessary in its music. The reception of Cephale et Procris tells us more about the world of opera in France in the 1690s and French music rather than her ability as a composer . This frustrates admirers of her work because it puts a stop to her operatic career as a composer completely. Despite this, she still continued to publish her work and take opportunities. Later in her life, her sonatas are considered triumphs of its genre . This is due to her development of the role for violin and how it blends French traditions with Italian innovations. After her death, her genius in compositions, her creativity in vocal and instrumental music, and her variety of genres are acknowledged. Her life and career success show that she was given a rare opportunity to succeed as a female composer, and how she took full advantage of it . It used to be considered proper for a young woman in upper society to attain proficiency on a classical instrument, usually the piano, harp, classical guitar, or voice. Women's roles in music, whether it be performance or education, was meant for their private lives inside their homes, rather than public. Other than this, women were not trained as professionals, however, because it was considered immodest for a woman to perform in public. These etiquette guidelines were typically spread by books such as Letters to a Young Lady written by John Bennett in 1798, and Letters to Young Ladies written by Lydia Sigourney in 1844. Musical performance was seen as a feminine pursuit, and thus schools for women often had more of a focus on music than schools for boys. In fact, the first music conservatory in the United States, Music Vale Seminary, was established in 1835 for the purpose of teaching women music. The culture of women learning music was so strong in the 18th century that George Washington's step-granddaughter Eleanor Custis Parke and Thomas Jefferson's wife Martha Jefferson were musicians. Women did not compose classical music often in the 18th century. While compositions written by women were acceptable in Europe and Great Britain, compositions written by American women were often vaguely attributed or unattributed. From 1870 to 1910, women started to take more jobs in classical music, usually teaching positions. American Clara Baur was the first woman to found a conservatory, the University of Cincinnati ‚Äì College-Conservatory of Music, in 1867. The growing American popularity of opera music in this time period also contributed to a rising number of women in classical music, as women were needed to sing prominent female parts.  20th century  In 1936, Nadia Boulanger conducted a concert with the London Philharmonic, the first woman to do so. Boulanger also went on to conduct the Philadelphia Orchestra, Boston Symphony, and New York Philharmonic in the following years. V√≠tƒõzslava Kapr√°lov√° conducted the Czech Philharmonic in 1937 and the BBC Orchestra (later known as the BBC Symphony Orchestra in 1938 in London, during the 16th ISCM Festival.kapralova.org Following the end of World War II, the number of women in classical music jobs greatly increased in the United States. In 1947, only 8% of symphony orchestra musicians were women, compared to 26.3% in 1982. The number of women in European orchestras, however, continued to remain low. Women in tenured composition positions at universities also remained very uncommon in the 1970s, with 10.6% of those positions occupied by women. In 1984 Odaline de la Martinez became the first woman to conduct at a BBC Promenade Concert at the Royal Albert Hall.  21st century  The ratio of women to men players in U.S. orchestras is roughly equal, but the ratio in European orchestras is still low. There are relatively few women conductors, but numbers are increasing, as figures like Marin Alsop, Barbara Hannigan, Susanna M√§lkki and Mirga Gra≈æinytƒó-Tyla gain public attention and popularity. Women in orchestras The first orchestra in the world to ever hire women musicians was the Queen's Hall Orchestra in London in 1913, led by Sir Henry Wood. Before 1913, women played in women-only orchestras, the first of which was founded by Mary Wurm in 1898 in Berlin. The first woman to join an American orchestra was harpist Edna Phillips, who was accepted into the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1930. Women were nonexistent in most major music symphony orchestras up until the 1960s. This imbalance has been particularly notable in music directorships of symphony orchestras, with 4.1% of major orchestras in the United States led by a woman, as of November 2016, Alt URL and out of the 150 recognized top conductors in the world, only 3.3% were women. The gap also extends to member positions in symphony orchestras. In 1982, the Berlin Philharmonic hired its first woman, Madeleine Carruzzo. In 2003, the Vienna Philharmonic appointed its first woman musician after 161 years of operating without women. In fact, there had been an explicit ban on women musicians until 1996, when the Philharmonic was threatened with budget cuts by the Austrian government. Women composers Sara Mohr-Pietsch estimates in an article for The Guardian that about 40% of living composers are female, and yet, she laments, only about 17% of names on music publishers lists are female. Research by the Boston Symphony Orchestra suggests a starker discrepancy; in programming for the top 22 US orchestras in 2014‚Äì2015, only 1.8% of composers were female. Recognising that, in historic times, opportunities for women as composers were (through unchallenged societal norms) far fewer, the work included a similar analysis considering the proportions of living composers programmed, but even within this sub-set of the data, the proportion of composers programmed who were women only reached 14.3%, far short of the near-parity that might be desired in these notionally more enlightened times, and only one third of Mohr-Pietsch's 40%. In \\"The Power List: Why Women Aren‚Äôt Equals In New Music Leadership and Innovation\\", Ellen McSweeney discusses six generic contributory factors identified by Sheryl Sandberg in Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead which may have some effect on these numbers, all of which would require further addressing to bring a more truly level playing field. * The sociological fact that women musicians, like all women, pay a ‚Äúlikability tax‚Äù when they are self- promoting, assertive, and successful. * Women musicians are less likely to embark on high visibility projects, take professional risks, and conceive of themselves as leaders‚Äîwhich leaves them at a distinct disadvantage in developing entrepreneurial careers. * Women consistently underestimate their own talents and abilities, leaving them at a disadvantage in the essential realm of self-promotion. * When choosing whom to hire, men are significantly more likely to choose a man. * Similarly, senior men are more likely to mentor young men than young women. * Women are taught from an early age to worry about whether they can have children and a career. Reactions Kristin Kuster makes the point that ‚ÄúThe message needs to be given that ...[composing] is something ...[women] can do and ...[music 'authorities'] want to hear from them,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf these women aren't seeing that this is a possibility, they can't even self-select out.‚Äù Marin Alsop said that when her conducting career began to take off she assumed that there was a larger trend of women conductors making their way in the orchestra world. ‚ÄúI thought it was changing, and then it didn‚Äôt change,‚Äù she has said. She is on record as saying that there can be a tendency to celebrate notable firsts or high-profile individual successes and just assume these one-offs mean a problem is solved. ‚ÄúYou can't give up just because the box is ticked,‚Äù Alsop said. ‚ÄúJust because Jennifer Higdon won the Pulitzer Prize [for composition] is no reason not to push for the next woman.\\"  Redress  Among the groups seeking to redress the gender imbalance in music have been: * The International Alliance for Women in Music * Fondazione Adkins Chiti: Donne in Musica headed by Patricia Adkins Chiti, a member organisation of the UNESCO International Music Council (see European Music Council). * Women's Philharmonic Advocacy. Promoting the legacy of the legendary Women's Philharmonic, this organization supports American orchestras that program music by women composers. * The Kapralova Society . Founded in 1998, the society publishes Kapralova Society Journal: A Journal of Women in Music. * Women in Music (UK) Historic groups with similar aims have included the Society of Women Musicians in the UK.

Three years later it was consuming 12% of the government's budget and in 1846 came under the scrutiny of Congress, but the government refused to provide details of the operation of the fund. History An 1846 attempt by Whigs to obtain details of covert operations ordered by John Tyler, pictured, was rebuffed by then-president James Polk. The Contingency Fund was established at the request of President George Washington in July 1790 with an initial appropriation of $40,000. Within three years this amount had grown to more than a million dollars, consuming roughly twelve percent of the United States federal budget. The terms of the appropriation the President to conceal the nature and purpose of expenditures made from the fund. Information about activities funded by the Contingency Fund are sparse, however, it is known they were generally ad hoc covert operations directed against European states. In 1831 Senator John Forsyth described the purpose of the fund as one designed to finance the operation of \\"spies, if the gentleman pleases; for persons sent publicly and secretly to search for important information, political or commercial ... for agents to feel the pulse of foreign governments.\\" By 1846 the Contingency Fund had come under increasing congressional scrutiny. Whigs in the United States House of Representatives requested a full accounting of expenditures made under the fund during the just-completed administration of John Tyler, a request then- president James Polk rebuffed, declaring that \\"in no nation is the application of such funds made public.\\" In the 1880s the first permanent U.S. government intelligence services were established in the form of the Office of Naval Intelligence and the Military Intelligence Division. Known operations financed by the Fund In its first year of existence, 1790, the fund was used to finance a sensitive diplomatic mission by Gouverneur Morris in London regarding outstanding boundary matters between the United States and United Kingdom. The first use of the fund to underwrite covert activities, meanwhile, occurred shortly thereafter when the United States secretly paid ransoms and tributes to the Barbary States for the release of American hostages and promises of non-interference with American shipping. In 1812 James Madison used $50,000 from the fund, equivalent to the cost of a naval frigate, to acquire the Henry letters, purported correspondence between alleged British spy John Henry and the Governor-General of Canada. The publication of the papers by Madison helped generate sufficient public outrage to secure the passage of the United States declaration of war upon the United Kingdom. Madison also tapped the fund to secretly finance paramilitary forces in Florida as a pressure against Spain.Richard W Leopold, The Growth of American Foreign Policy: A History (1962) p. 63. According to a public statement made by president John Tyler, Duff Green was paid $1,000 from the fund to finance an operation in the United Kingdom in 1841 that influenced the appointment of the Lord Ashburton as the British negotiator in the Maine-New Brunswick border dispute. The ultimate settlement of that dispute resulted in the net transfer of about of territory to the United States by the United Kingdom, to the consternation of many in Canada.

Yet again, O'Donnell went full circle and made the decision to move back home to Waikato. But Plagued by achilles tendonitis O'Donnell struggled to find form. He made only 4 appearances and starting only 2 games for Waikato, Who went on to win the championship division over Otago Super Rugby After a long and meandering provincial career, O'Donnell finally landed a Super Rugby contract with the defending champions, the in 2017.

It is found in southern and eastern China, where it causes white rot. Taxonomy The fungus was described as new to science in 2008 by mycologists Bao-Kai Cui and Yu-Cheng Dai. The type collection, made in Wuzhishan Nature Reserve in Wuzhishan County (Hainan), was found growing on decaying angiosperm wood. The specific epithet luteolus (yellowish) refers to the colour of the dry pore surface. Description The fruit body of Skeletocutis luteolus is in the form of a crust with dimensions of up to long by wide by thick. Fresh fruit bodies, typically white to cream in colour, have a soft texture that becomes corky, and deepens in colour to buff-yellow or orange-buff when dry. The round to angular pores number about five to seven per millimetre. The fungus has a dimitic hyphal system (with both generative and skeletal hyphae), and the generative hyphae have clamp connections. The spores are hyaline (translucent), allantoid (sausage-shaped), and typically measure 3‚Äì3.6 by 0.4‚Äì0.7 Œºm. Skeletocutis luteolus is somewhat similar in appearance to S. nivea and S. fimbriata. It can be distinguished from S. nivea by differences in fruit body morphology and smaller pores. Unlike S. luteolus, S. fimbriata has a distinct margin encircling the fruit body, and it has larger pores.

Johnson and starring Tony Jaa, Iko Uwais and Tiger Chen, as well as Scott Adkins, Michael Jai White, Michael Bisping, Celina Jade, and Jeeja Yanin. The film was released to generally positive reviews, with critics praising the fight choreography as well as the cast performances, but criticism of the lack of plot and character development. Plot Deveraux enlists mercenaries, ex-Thai Special Forces Payu and ex-Chinese Special Forces Long Fei, for a humanitarian mission in Thailand to free prisoners. Unknown to Payu and Long Fei's, Deveraux and his crew (Mook, Joey, Steiner and Dom) want to free their leader, Collins, a terrorist. Deveraux and his crew shoot up the village guarded by Indonesian soldiers for hire, waking up Jaka, who sees his wife get shot multiple times. During the ensuing chaos, Payu and Jaka fight. Before the victor could be determined, Mook shoots a grenade at Jaka, injuring him heavily and knocking him out. Deveraux frees Collins, and Collins kills his captor. Deveraux double crosses Payu and Long Fei to tie up loose ends, knocking them down into a cage. Collins sets a bomb to burn down the evidence. Payu and Long Fei free the prisoners and barely escape. In the aftermath, Jaka wakes up and sees his village in shambles. After burying his wife and the villagers, he swears vengeance against Payu and the people responsible for the destruction of his village. A few days later, Jaka learns that Payu and Long Fei are participating in an illegal boxing ring in Maha Jaya. After Payu defeats a boxer, Jaka and Long Fei face off. Long Fei beats Jaka, but Payu recognizes him as the villager he fought a few days ago. After healing Jaka and giving him food, Jaka gets them drunk and calls the cops. Payu and Long Fei are arrested and sent to the Central Police Station. A philanthropist named Tian Xiao Xian arrives in Maha Jaya. Xiao Xian plans to donate money to charity to purge the city's corruption. Su Feng orders Collins and his crew to kill her, due to Xiao Xian being an obstacle to Su Feng's criminal activities. As Madame Liang plans takes Xiao Xian to the Chinese Embassy, Collins and his crew arrive and attempt to kill her. In the process many local bodyguards are killed, Madame Liang is injured but not before gunning down Dom and telling Xiao Xian that she must go to the Central Police Station, as that is the only place she will be safe. Xiao Xian arrives at the police station to get help, but they do not understand her due to language barrier. The police take Long Fei to her and interrogate Payu in another room. Meanwhile, Collins and his crew arrive at the police station after a tip from Jaka. As Payu fights Steiner, Jaka shoots Steiner in the back, allowing Payu to kill Steiner. Jaka reveals that he is on their side and had Payu and Long Fei arrested to draw Collins out. Long Fei fights against Joey and beats him, escaping with Payu and Xiao Xian. Jaka kills Mook by blowing her up with a grenade launcher, then meets up with Collins to ally with him, acting as a mole. After barely escaping from Collins twice, Payu calls Collins and offers to trade Xiao Xian for $100,000 and his freedom, asking to meet at the old Poker House. Collins agrees but tells his crew and Jaka to use all their remaining money to hire shooters to kill them instead. Payu goes to his old boss and convinces him to give them weapons. Long Fei and Xiao Xian meet up with Collins and his crew at the location, while Payu swiftly guns down all the shooters. In the ensuing chaos, Long Fei knocks out Joey by smashing a brick on his head and helps Jaka kill Deveraux. After Jaka calls the Chinese ambassador and reveals where Xiao Xian is, he tries to help Payu beat Collins, but he is too much for them. Jaka is kicked off the balcony by Collins. Collins finds Xiao Xian and tries to shoot her, but Long Fei jumps in, taking the bullet. Payu arrives and finally kills Collins. Joey wakes up and is about to shoot Payu when Xiao Xian kills him. The next day, Su Feng is arrested. Madame Liang finds Xiao Xian and reveals that Jaka was the one who gave them their location. Madame Liang takes Xiao Xian to the Chinese Embassy, and Payu and Long Fei jokingly berate Jaka for nearly getting them all killed.

She worked as a field nurse during the American Civil War, receiving a Kearny Cross from the 17th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment, whom she had cared for after the Battle of Chancellorsville. She was the first woman who protested against the suffrage movement, and she was the editor of the first American anti-suffrage periodical, The True Woman. Early years Charlotte Elizabeth Johnson was born in Waterford, Maine on August 2, 1818. Her father was Dr. Abner Johnson, inventor of Johnson's Anodyne Liniment, and there were six siblings. In 1854, she married William P. McKay (died April 10, 1856), and their only child, Julia, died May 1861, in South Reading. Career McKay accepted an appointment under Dorothea Dix as a hospital nurse, and commenced her hospital life in Frederick, Maryland, in March, 1862, where she was entrusted with the care of a large number of wounded from the First Battle of Winchester. In September, 1862, the city was filled for two or three days with Stonewall Jackson's Corps on their way to South Mountain and Antietam. The rebels took possession of the hospital, and filled it for the time with their sick and wounded men. Resistance was useless, and McKay treated the rebel officers and men courteously, and did what she could for the sick; her civility and kindness were recognized, and she was treated respectfully. After the Battle of Antietam, Frederick City and its hospitals were filled with the wounded, but as soon as the wounded became convalescent, she went to Washington, D.C. and was assigned to duty for a time in the hospitals of the Capital. In January, she went to Falmouth, Virginia and found employment as a nurse in the Third Corps Hospital. Here, she soon effected an evolution in the hospital; from being the worst, it became the best of the corps hospitals at the front. General David B. Birney and his wife, seconded and encouraged all her efforts for its improvement. The battles known as Battle of Chancellorsville were full of horrors for McKay. She witnessed the assault on Marye's Heights, and while ministering to the wounded, she received the news that her brother, who was with Joseph Hooker at Chancellorsville, had been killed in the protracted fighting there. Six weeks later, she was in Washington, awaiting the battle between Robert E. Lee's forces and Hooker's, afterwards commanded by General George Meade. When the intelligence of the Battle of Gettysburg came, she went to Baltimore, and then to Gettysburg, reaching the hospital of her division, five miles from Gettysburg, on 7 July 1863. Here, she remained for nearly two months, caring for 1,000 to 1,500 wounded men. In the autumn, she again sought the hospital of the Third Division, Third Corps, at the front, which for the time was at Warrenton, Virginia. After the Battle of Mine Run, she cared for the wounded; and later in the season, she had charge of one of the hospitals at Brandy Station. Like the other women who were connected with hospitals at this place, she was compelled to retire by the order of April 15; but like them, she returned to her work early in May, at Belle Plains, Fredericksburg, White House, and City Point. The changes in the army organization in June, 1864, removed most of her friends in the old third corps, and McKay, on the invitation of the surgeon in charge of the Cavalry Corps hospital, took charge of the special diet of that hospital, where she remained for nearly a year, finally leaving the service in March, 1865, and remaining in Virginia in the care and instruction of the Freedmen till late in the spring of 1866. The officers and men who had been under her care in the Cavalry Corps Hospital, presented her on Christmas Day, 1864, with an elegant gold badge and chain, with a suitable inscription, as a testimonial of their gratitude for her services. She had previously received from the officers of the 17th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment, whom she had cared for after the battle of Chancellorsville, a Kearny Cross, with its motto and an inscription indicating by whom it was presented. She did not receive a military pension and had generally not been paid for the nursing work that she did. On 10 February 1870, a hearing was granted by the senate committee of the District of Columbia, to a delegation of ladies, one of whom, McKay, of Massachusetts, read a paper remonstrating against the extension of suffrage to the women of the US. This paper was afterwards presented as a memorial in the senate, referred to the committee on the judiciary, and ordered to be printed as a congressional document. It was afterwards, as a tract, extensively circulated throughout the country. McKay may, therefore, be recorded as the first woman who protested against the suffrage movement. She became the editor of the first American anti-suffrage periodical, The True Woman in the following year, published out of Baltimore, Maryland. Later years She wrote her memoirs in Wakefield, Massachusetts, and published them in 1876. She moved to San Diego, California in the 1890s where she died in 1894.

Signed on 1 June 1773, it transferred control of ducal Schleswig-Holstein to the Danish crown in return for Russian control of the County of Oldenburg and adjacent lands within the Holy Roman Empire. The treaty reduced the fragmentation of Danish territory and led to an alliance between Denmark and Russia that lasted into the Napoleonic Wars. It also made possible the construction of the Eider Canal, parts of which were later incorporated into the Kiel Canal. Historical background=Oldenburg and Delmenhorst In 1448 the Count of Oldenburg was elected King of Denmark and took the throne as Christian I. He assigned Oldenburg to his brother, Gerhard, in 1454, and Gerhard's descendants in the House of Oldenburg continued to rule the county for the next two centuries. In 1547 Emperor Charles V also gave the counts of Oldenburg control of the town of Delmenhorst, which adjoins Oldenburg on the left bank of the Weser, in return for Oldenburg's support in the Schmalkaldic War. When the last count of Oldenburg, Anthony G√ºnther, died childless in 1667, these territories reverted to the kings of Denmark, who began to rule them in personal union. Schleswig-Holstein Territorial borders in Schleswig-Holstein 1650 (with royal holdings in orange and ducal holdings in yellow), showing the region's extreme fragmentation In 1460, upon his election as Duke of Holstein, King Christian I promulgated the Treaty of Ribe, affirming that Schleswig (a Danish fief) and Holstein (part of the Holy Roman Empire) were to remain \\"forever undivided\\" in return for his recognition by the region's noble estates as the rightful ruler of Schleswig-Holstein. From that time forward, Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein were ruled in personal union by the Danish kings for nearly a century. Then, in 1544 King Christian III of Denmark partitioned the two duchies between himself and his two half-brothers, John and Adolf, in an unusual way that would shape Danish politics for centuries. Schleswig- Holstein's noble estates remained opposed to the actual division of the region, so the revenues of the duchies were divided into three equal shares by assigning the revenues of particular areas and landed estates to particular brothers. The piecemeal assignment of the estates left Holstein and Schleswig with a patchwork of political boundaries, inhibiting any future separation of the regions, as intended by the estates. The rule in the duchies thus became a condominium of the king and the two dukes. Duke John died childless, and his share in the region was divided between his brothers' lines, but Duke Adolf's descendants in the House of Holstein-Gottorp, who ruled not only the ducal share of Schleswig-Holstein but also the Prince-Bishopric of L√ºbeck, became rivals to the Danish kings. Gottorp Question By the mid-17th century the so-called \\"Gottorp Question\\" of Holstein's relationship with the crown threatened the stability of the Danish kingdom, as the dukes of Holstein- Gottorp allied themselves with Sweden and other foreign powers against Denmark. During the minority of Duke Charles Frederick, Schleswig-Holstein's government affairs were entrusted to Minister Georg Heinrich von G√∂rtz, who supported Sweden in the Great Northern War; in that war's aftermath, Denmark seized the duke's territory in Schleswig and ended Sweden's patronage of Holstein-Gottorp with the 1720 Treaty of Frederiksborg. Duke Charles Frederick sought support for the recovery of Schleswig in Russia, and in 1725 he married Russian Princess Anna Petrovna, the daughter of Emperor Peter the Great and sister of the future Empress Elizabeth. In 1742 the childless Elizabeth appointed her nephew, Charles Peter Ulrich (Charles Frederick and Anna's son), to be her successor in Russia. After her death in 1762, this Duke of Holstein ascended the throne as Peter III of Russia; Ducal Holstein was now ruled in personal union by the Emperor of Russia. Negotiations Peter, now both Duke of Holstein-Gottorp and Russian Emperor, dispatched minister Caspar von Saldern to the Danish court to demand the recovery of his former ducal territory in Schleswig. At the time of Peter's accession Russia was already fighting in the Third Silesian War theatre of the Seven Years' War, but he quickly made peace with Prussia and directed troops into Pomerania to threaten war against Denmark if Schleswig were not restored. The Danish government under Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff refused to relinquish Schleswig, and Russian and Danish troops came face to face in Mecklenburg; but, on 9 July 1762, before fighting began or any agreement could be reached, Peter was overthrown by his wife, who took control of Russia as Empress Catherine II. Catherine reversed Russia's stance, withdrawing her husband's ultimatum and even entering an alliance with Denmark in 1765. She transferred the Duchy of Holstein to her minor son, Grand Duke Paul (later Emperor Paul I of Russia), and instructed her representative, von Saldern, to negotiate a peaceful solution to the Schleswig-Holstein conflict with his Danish counterpart, Foreign Minister Andreas Peter Bernstorff. The negotiators reached a provisional agreement in 1767. Grand Duke Paul would renounce the House of Romanov's claims in Schleswig-Holstein and transfer the ducal lands in Holstein to King Christian VII of Denmark, ending the Duchy of Holstein- Gottorp; in return, Denmark would reaffirm its alliance with Russia, pay a sizeable indemnity, and give Paul control of the County of Oldenburg and other hereditary Oldenburg lands in the Holy Roman Empire. The agreement was accepted by Catherine in 1767; after he came of age, Grand Duke Paul ratified the treaty on 1 June 1773 at the Russian imperial family's residence in Tsarskoye Selo, south of Saint Petersburg. On 12 August Russia and Denmark signed a further treaty of alliance against Sweden, and the bargain was complete. Results The duchies of Schleswig, Holstein and Oldenburg 1789, showing the outcome of the treaty This territorial exchange placed the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein under a single sovereign, the Danish King, and ended the political and dynastic conflicts that had divided the region since its partition two centuries earlier. The political unification of Schleswig‚ÄìHolstein made possible the development of the Eider Canal, whose construction began the following year. The establishment of full, direct control over this strategically significant borderland strengthened Denmark's geopolitical position considerably and marked a major step toward Denmark's emergence as a centralised, unitary state. The alliance which shortly followed (contemporaneously called the \\"Eternal Alliance\\" ()Feldb√¶k, Ole (1998): N√¶dhed og adskillelse 1720‚Äì1814, pp. 320 and 325) tied Denmark's foreign policy to Russia's and led directly to Danish involvement in the Theatre War of 1788‚Äì1789 and the Dano-Swedish War of 1808‚Äì09. On the Russian side, the exchange allowed Catherine to turn Denmark from an enemy into an ally, furthering Nikita Ivanovich Panin's policy of building a Northern Accord to balance the power of Bourbon France; a stronger Denmark would also help to contain Sweden (Russia's chief rival in the Baltic Sea region). In 1774, Grand Duke Paul (at the urging of his mother) transferred the German lands obtained from the exchange to his great-uncle, Frederick August, and in 1777 they were united within a newly declared Duchy of Oldenburg. The Duchy of Oldenburg would remain connected to the Russian Empire until its annexation by Napoleon's French Empire in 1810.

Napoleon Community Schools, 580 U.S. ___ (2017), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Handicapped Children's Protection Act of 1986 does not command exhaustion of state-level administrative remedies codified in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) when the gravamen of the plaintiff's lawsuit is not related to the denial of free appropriate public education (FAPE).  Background  Minor Ehlena Fry was born with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy, which significantly impairs her motor skills and mobility. Ehlena Fry, originally in an orphanage in Calcutta, India, was adopted by Stacy and Brent Fry. In 2008, Fry's pediatrician prescribed a service dog for Ehlena; the community ran a fundraiser so that the Fry family could purchase a service dog for their adopted daughter. The service dog Wonder would help Ehlena Fry, amongst other things, open doors, turn on lights, pick up dropped items, help her remove her coat, and help her balance while she transferred from her walker onto a chair or the toilet. The administration of Ezra Eby Elementary School (one of the Napoleon Community Schools), however, denied permission to bring her service dog to school for the 2009-2010 school year. Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, schools are obligated to provide disabled children the Individualized Education Program (IEP) in order to provide them free appropriate public education (FAPE). The school district argued that a human aide can provide all the necessary help so that Ehlena Fry can get free and appropriate public education. The school's decision to prohibit Wonder was upheld in the meeting held in January 2010 related to Fry's IEP. The Fry family maintained that the service dog, which had time to bond with Ehlena, is necessary as a bridge to her independence, and that the right to bring her service dog is covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Once the American Civil Liberties Union intervened to represent the Frys, the school allowed Ehlena Fry to bring Wonder for the \\"trial period\\" (from April 2010 until the end of the school year); however, Wonder was not allowed to accompany Ehlena Fry during lunch time, in library, in computer labs, during recess, and during any other school activities. Wonder also had to sit at the back of the classroom whenever a class was in session. After the trial period, the school informed the Frys that Ehlena would not be allowed to bring Wonder to school during the 2010-2011 school year. The Frys homeschooled their daughter for the 2010-2011 school year. During that time, the Frys filed a complaint to the Office of Civil Rights of the United States Department of Education, which issued a determination letter that the school violated Ehlena Fry's rights protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act \\"by failing to modify their policies, practices, or procedures to permit the student's service animal to accompany her to and assist her at school, thus denying and/or significantly limiting the student's ability to access the district's programs and activities with as much independence as possible\\". The school, without accepting the OCR's determinations, eventually allowed the Frys to bring her service dog, starting from the 2012-2013 school year; but feeling that Ehlena and Wonder were still not welcomed by the administration, the family transferred to a school in a neighbouring county which allowed Fry to bring her service dog. The Fry family sued the Napoleon Community Schools, the principal of Ezra Eby Elementary School, and the school district under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act, for damages for the 2009-2010, 2010-2011, and 2011-2012 school years for the following: the denial of equal access; the denial of the use of Wonder; interference to form bonds with other kids; denial of an opportunity to interact with other children; and emotional distress and pain, embarrassment, mental anguish, inconvenience, and loss of enjoyment. The Napoleon Community Schools moved to dismiss the lawsuit for failing to exhaust the IDEA administrative remedies. The Frys countered that since they seek for the declaratory judgement that the school violated the ADA and money damages for emotional distress, both of which are not the type of remedies available under the IDEA. They also argued that they do not accuse the school of not providing free and appropriate public education. For these reasons, they argued that the administrative remedy exhaustion requirement does not apply.  Legislative background  The Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EHA or EAHCA) was enacted in 1975, to require all public schools accepting public funds to provide equal access to education to children with disabilities via a personalized education plan with parents' input. The EHA's name was changed to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in 1990. Besides the IDEA, there are other federal statutes covering the rights of people with disabilities, including, but not limited to, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. ¬ß12131 et seq., and ¬ß504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. ¬ß794. Title II of the ADA mandates public facilities to make \\"reasonable modifications\\" to avoid discriminating against people with disabilities. Similarly, the Rehabilitation Act demands certain modifications to existing practices to accommodate people with disabilities. Both statutes allow individuals to bring suits for relief or damages to have their grievances addressed. The interaction between these three laws was addressed by the Supreme Court of the United States in Smith v. Robinson . In Smith, the plaintiffs brought their claims not just under the EHA, but also the virtually identical claims under the Rehabilitation Act and the Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court ruled that any claims brought under the Rehabilitation Act and the Equal Protection Clause are preempted by the EHA, as the EHA, with its \\"comprehensive\\" and \\"carefully tailored\\" provisions, was intended to be the exclusive means for the parents to challenge the adequacy of the school's accommodation for their disabled child. Congress was quick to overrule Smith by enacting the Handicapped Children's Protection Act of 1986. It also added a carefully defined administrative remedy exhaustion requirement, codified at 20 U.S.C. ¬ß1415(l). The text of this statute is read as follows: The issue in this case was how the scope of this exhaustion requirement should be interpreted, the question which caused a circuit split.  Ruling by the lower courts  Judge Lawrence Paul Zatkoff of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan agreed with the schools and dismissed the lawsuit because the claims necessarily implicated the IDEA, which required plaintiffs to exhaust all administrative remedies before suing under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. The Frys appealed and argued that the exhaustion requirement did not apply because they were seeking damages, which is not the sort of relief the IDEA provided. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal in a 2-1 ruling, with Judges John M. Rogers and Bernice B. Donald forming the majority. The majority of the Sixth Circuit held that the Frys‚Äô claims were essentially educational‚Äîparticularly, they noted that \\"developing a bond with Wonder that allows E.F. to function more independently outside the classroom is an educational goal\\". Therefore, this is precisely the sort of claims the IDEA was meant to address, and therefore the exhaustion requirement applied. Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey dissented. Judge Daughtrey wrote that since Frys' request to bring Wonder to school was not related to Ehlena's academic program ‚Äì hence not educational in nature ‚Äì there is no reason for the administrative remedy exhaustion requirement to apply. Particularly, she observed that \\"[the Frys'] request could be honored simply by modifying the school policy allowing guide dogs to include service dogs\\" (emphasis original).  Supreme Court of the United States  The Frys applied to the Supreme Court of the United States. The federal government also filed a brief recommending that the Supreme Court grant the writ of certiorari, arguing that the Sixth Circuit incorrectly decided the case in favour of the respondents. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on June 28, 2016. Amicus briefs in support of the Fry family were filed by National Disability Rights Network, Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, Psychiatric Service Dog Partners, and Autism Speaks. Former Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., who was actively involved in drafting many disability rights laws including the ones in this issue (Handicapped Children's Protection Act, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Americans with Disabilities Act), also filed an amicus brief supporting the petitioners arguing that the Sixth Circuit's ruling runs contrary to the Congress's intent. The National School Boards Association filed a brief supporting the respondents, urging the nation's highest court to uphold the process meant to encourage that the parent and the school work together for the child's special education needs. The oral argument took place on October 31, 2016; the Supreme Court released its opinion on February 22, 2017.  Supreme Court Opinion  The Supreme Court of the United States announced the opinion on February 22, 2017. The opinion of the Court was written by Justice Elena Kagan, joined by the Chief Justice, Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Samuel Alito filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas.  Opinion of the Court  Part I = The Court reviews the history of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the law at issue in this case, and also reviews the facts of this case. = Part II = On the merits, the Court held the following. * The IDEA's remedy exhaustion requirement does not apply when a lawsuit seeks relief unrelated to the denial of a free appropriate public education (FAPE). * To determine if a lawsuit seeks relief for the denial of a FAPE or not, a court should examine the gravamen ‚Äì equivalently, the substance ‚Äì of the plaintiff's complaint. To reach the first conclusion, the Court focused on the language of the relevant section (specifically, 20 U.S.C. ¬ß1415(l), which covers the administrative exhaustion requirement), which \\"requires that a plaintiff exhaust IDEA's procedures before filing an action under ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, or similar laws when (but only when) her suit 'seek[s] relief that is also available' under the IDEA\\". The opinion, quoting Black's Law Dictionary, noted that the \\"relief\\" for lawsuits means the \\"redress or benefit\\" that can be conferred upon a favourable judgement. Further, the opinion noted that a relief is \\"available\\" when it is \\"accessible or may be obtained\\", this time quoting Ross v. Blake. Thus, in the Court's view, analyzing when the IDEA enables a person to obtain relief is paramount to determining the scope of the exhaustion requirement. The court's opinion noted that the Congress declared the IDEA is \\"to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education\\" (quoting ¬ß1400(d)(1)(A)). Therefore, the IDEA's administrative remedies are meant to test whether a school completed their obligation to provide a child meaningful access to a free appropriate public education ‚Äì in other words, \\"a FAPE denial is the sine qua non\\". If a type of accommodation will fulfill the IDEA's requirement, then the administrative officer orders such relief. However, even though another law besides the IDEA may require an accommodation on alternative grounds, the officer nonetheless cannot order such relief if it does not touch on a FAPE denial. In the Court's view, this is precisely the line that the law dictates. For example, in the case of Smith, which compelled the Congress to amend the relevant law, the petitioner would not be able to evade the exhaustion requirement by bringing a lawsuit under a different law because her lawsuit concerned the denial of a FAPE. However, if a lawsuit is brought under a different law such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act and does not concern the denial of a FAPE, then the IDEA administrative officer cannot grant the parents any relief. Therefore, the exhaustion is not required in this case. Since it is possible for a school's refusal to allow certain accommodation to injure a child in a way that is unrelated to a FAPE, in such circumstances the administrative remedy exhaustion does not apply. The Court again emphasized that \\"the only 'relief' the IDEA makes 'available' is relief for the denial of a FAPE\\". Then the Court laid out a test that lower courts should use to decide whether a plaintiff seeks relief for the denial of a FAPE or not. Noting that the IDEA asks whether a lawsuit \\"seeks\\" relief available under the IDEA, the Court wrote that the court should look at the gravamen ‚Äì or the substance ‚Äì of a plaintiff's complaint. This way, the lower courts can set aside any attempts of artful pleading made to circumvent the exhaustion requirement by using certain labels. If the gravamen covers the denial of a FAPE, then the exhaustion requirement applies; otherwise, it does not. However, this is not to say that three laws in question (the IDEA, the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act) do not overlap in coverage. Yet, there are some important differences: the IDEA only covers children and adolescents and covers their schooling only; on the other hand, the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act are intended to root out any disability-based discriminations, and cover people with disabilities of all ages. After noting the key differences between the three laws, the Court laid out the three-prong test to determine whether the gravamen of a complaint concerns the denial of a FAPE rather than disability-based discrimination, in the form of questions, two of which are hypothetical in nature: * The first prong: could the plaintiff have brought essentially the same claim if the conduct had occurred at a public facility other than a school, such as a public theatre of a public library? * The second prong: could an adult, not a child, conceivably have brought the essentially identical lawsuit? * The third prong: does the history of the proceedings indicate that the gravamen is related to the denial of a FAPE? Thus, if the answer to the first two questions is yes, then it is likely that the lawsuit does not concern the denial of a FAPE. Then the Court provided a hypothetical situation where this is the case. Suppose that the family of a wheelchair-bound child sues her school for discrimination under the ADA without touching on the denial of a FAPE due to the school's lack of access ramps. One may argue that this may be related to the denial of a FAPE: after all, if a child has difficulty accessing the school building, then she cannot receive education; besides, if someone has to carry her over, then the child may not achieve independence needed for her academic success. Yet, it is possible for the child to file the essentially identical lawsuit against a public library lacking such access ramps. Furthermore, it is possible for a visitor to the school to file the essentially identical complaint against the school. Therefore, this lawsuit most likely is concerned with equality of access to facilities, which is in the domain of disability-based discrimination rather than the adequacy of the school's FAPE-related accommodations. On the other hand, if the answer to the first two questions is no, then such lawsuit cannot avoid the exhaustion requirement. For instance, suppose that a student with a learning disability sues his school under the ADA for failing to provide additional tutoring in mathematics. This could be considered disability-based discrimination; however, such lawsuit fails under the test devised by the Court, even though the complaint does not mention the denial of a FAPE anywhere. First, it is unlikely that this student can press the identical lawsuit against a public library. Second, it is inconceivable that an adult visitor or an adult employee of the school will press such lawsuit. Hence, the substance of the student's complaint is related to the denial of a FAPE, so this student must exhaust the administrative procedures first. The third prong touches on the history of the proceedings, which might suggest that the lawsuit is related to the denial of a FAPE. If a plaintiff formally invoked the IDEA's administrative procedures before switching the course, that can possibly suggest that the gravamen of the complaint is related to a FAPE denial. While it is possible for a plaintiff to realize in the middle of the procedure that the school completed their obligations and that their complaints are unrelated to a FAPE, such formal invocation of the IDEA procedures may serve as evidence that the gravamen of the plaintiff's claim concerns the FAPE denial. = Part III = In the last part of the opinion, the Court revisited the Frys' claims and attempted to apply the test it laid out to Frys' claims. The Court noted that the Frys' complaint only discusses disability-based discrimination, such as the school district's \\"refusal to allow Wonder to act as a service dog discriminated against [E.F.] as a person with disabilities ... by denying her equal access\\" to public facilities. Not only did it not state that Wonder enhances E.F.'s educational opportunities, but the Frys agreed with the school district's assertion that E.F.'s educational needs were satisfied by a one-on- one human aide. The Frys' instead focused on the infringement of E.F.'s right to equal access, as the Office of Civil Rights found. The Court also concluded that nothing in the Frys' suit suggests any focus on the educational needs. It noted that the Frys' claims will probably pass the first prong, as the Frys could have filed the same lawsuit if a public library refused to allow Wonder to enter the building. The claims will likely pass the second prong as well because a disabled adult could have levelled the essentially same charges if the adult's service dog was refused access to public facilities such as a school, for not adhering to the equal access requirements as codified in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Based on the information before the Court, it concludes that the Frys' claims are the type of claims that focus on disability-based discrimination rather than the denial of a free appropriate public education. However, the Court declined to undertake the analysis for the third prong, as neither parties addressed the history of the Frys' proceedings. The Court thus vacated the Sixth Circuit's judgment and remanded the case so that the Sixth Circuit can determine whether, for example, the Frys pursued the IDEA's formal procedures before filing the case. If the Frys started from that road, then the lower court should determine whether such actions reveal that the substance of the Frys' complains is related to the denial of a FAPE.  Alito's partial concurrence  Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, joined Part I and the parts of Part II regarding the Court's first conclusion on the merits. Alito wrote that he (along with Justice Thomas) declined to join the later part of the Court's opinion where the court laid out the test for the lower courts to use when examining the gravamen of the plaintiff's complaint. Specifically, Alito wrote that the court's test would work well only if there is no overlap between the relief available under the IDEA and the relief provided by other federal laws (including the Rehabilitation Act, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the United States Constitution, inter alia), yet the court admitted that there may be instances when there is such overlap. Alito also disagreed with the third prong of the court's test, which in part stated that the lower court should examine whether (and to what extent) the parents pursued but later abandoned the IDEA's formal procedures before filing a formal lawsuit under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. Alito criticized the court for failing to take into other factors that may have led the plaintiff to pursue the IDEA's formal procedure first, such as being advised by their attorney to pursue the IDEA procedure before abandoning it, or the parents amending their complaints to give up parts of the relief available under the IDEA and turn to another federal statute in the course of their lawsuit. Calling them \\"misleading clues\\", Alito concluded that the test laid out by the court will invite more confusion and lead the lower courts astray.  Reactions  Michael Steinberg, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Michigan, which has represented Fry throughout her legal proceedings, praised the ruling, stating that \\"[w]e're thrilled that the Supreme Court has torn down unfair barriers faced by students who seek to vindicate their rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act\\". Stacy Fry, Ehlena's mother, also praised the ruling in her statement: \\"[w]e are thankful that the Supreme Court has clarified that schools cannot treat children with disabilities differently or stand in the way of their desired independence.\\" She also added that \\"We feel that this really is a victory for our family and all the families with children of differing abilities. For us, it really means that we did the right thing. It was not in vain. We had a bigger purpose\\". The National School Boards Association expressed concerns, stating that the court's ruling may lead lower courts astray as the lower courts try to apply the law. Naomi Gittins, the managing director of legal advocacy for the NSBA, stated that \\"[g]oing right to court is never a good approach when you're talking about educational issues[.] It could result in court cases that run up bills rather than a parent talking about this with the school\\". Writing for SCOTUSblog, Amy Howe wrote that the Court's ruling is \\"a significant win ‚Äì not only for [Ehlena Fry] and her family, but also for children with disabilities nationwide\\".  Subsequent development  Upon remand, on 25 September 2019, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan directed that the case be set a trial by jury. The case was ultimately settled on 14 November 2019, under undisclosed terms.

Life Sangsul Yi was born in Jincheon (ÏßÑÏ≤ú) in the province of Chungcheong and was sprung from a Yi Haeng-u's loin. He was famous for his brightness, so in 1876, at the age of 7, he was adopted into Yi Yong-u's family and he relocated to Seoul. In 1896, he became a professor of Seonggyungwan. In 1904, when the Empire of Japan demanded the reclamation right of wasteland, he made an appeal to the king to refuse that. In 1905, at that time of Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1905, he made an appeal to the king to oppose the treaty and kill the Five Eulsa Traitors five times. However, he left office and attempted suicide. From then on, he take the initiative in restoring national right and patriotic enlightenment movement. In 1907 he and his compatriots Yi Tjoune and Tjyongoui Yi were delegated by Emperor Gojong to attend the Second Hague Peace Conference in The Hague. He was commissioned to announce to the international community that Korea was an independent state and that the Japanese invasion was unlawful. The trio traveled for two months on the Trans-Siberian Railway to The Hague. The Korean delegation was not officially invited, although the Netherlands initially had planned. However, the Japanese government was able to step in and succeeded in convincing the other delegates of the conference not to let Korea participate. The mission had already failed. However, the three Koreans succeeded in receiving worldwide attention due to a press conference and receiving attention in an independent newspaper which covered the Peace Conference. The direct result of their mission was that the Korean Emperor, Gojong was forced to resign in favor of his son Sunjong. In 1910, Yi founded 13 douigun (13ÎèÑÏùòÍµ∞), troops against Empire of Japan, with Yoo In-seok, Yi Beom- yun, Yi Nam-gi to united loyal troops and deploy more effective war against Japan.

Background Miu Hin is believed to be the father of Miu Tsui Fa and the grandfather of Fong Sai-Yuk, who would later become a renowned martial artist and a popular folk hero (although this may just be a myth due to the fact that it is unknown whether Fong Sai-Yuk was a real person or a work of fiction). According to folk tale, Miu Hin was a master of the Five Shape Boxing style and various Shaolin martial arts, and passed on his knowledge to his daughter who would later pass it on to her son. He is also believed to have helped create Wing Chun with the other Five Elders. Although Miu Hin was an actual figure along with the other Five Elders, most of the stories involving him are based on folk legend, and it's unknown whether or not they're true. Escaping the Destruction of Shaolin Miu Hin was an elder of the Shaolin temple prior to its destruction. While he was an elder of the Shaolin monk, he was not ordained, and was \\"unshaved\\". After the Qing dynasty overthrew the Ming dynasty in 1644, a lot of political officers of the Ming government escaped imprisonment and found sanctuary behind temples and monasteries. This combined with the fact that the Shaolin temple also provided sanctuary to many rebels of the Qing empire led the Qing to attack and burn down the Shaolin Monastery in either 1647,1674, or 1732. According to legend, Miu Hin along with Jee Sin(Ëá≥ÂñÑÁ¶ÖÂ∏à), Fung Dou Dak(ÂÜØÈÅìÂæ∑), Bak Mei(ÁôΩÁúâÈÅì‰∫∫), and Ng Mui(‰∫îÊ¢ÖÂ§ßÂ∏à) escaped the destruction of the Shaolin Monastery, thus becoming the Five Elders of Shaolin. The elders traveled for over a year until they reached a temple in current day Sichuan Province. Duel with Bak Mei and Death After reaching the temple at Sichuan Province, Bak Mei and the other four elders constantly had heated arguments regarding how involved they should get in politics and how many students they should have. Bak Mei favored more political involvement and taking in more students while the other four elders favored a more secluded life and taking in few, if any students. This disagreement allegedly led to a duel between Jee Sin and Bak Mei to settle the dispute, resulting in the death of Jee Sin by Bak Mei. Angered by Jee Sin's death, Miu Hin allegedly challenged Bak Mei to another duel in an effort to avenge Jee Sin. Although the fight was said to be close, Miu Hin was killed by Bak Mei during the duel. After Miu Hin's death, Fung Dou Dak would challenge Bak Mei to a final duel. After witnessing both of Bak Mei's duels and studying Bak Mei's techniques, Fong Dou Dak managed to defeat Bak Mei, who died of his injuries shortly afterwards.

He was known for his studies on the synthesis of isoquinolines and phenanthridines and his contributions in elucidating the structure of several plant constituents. He was an elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences and the Indian National Science Academy and was the nominator of Robert Burns Woodward who won the 1965 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 1960, for his contributions to chemical sciences, making him the first recipient of the award in the chemical sciences category.  Biography  Govindachari was born on 30 July 1915 to Tuticorin Raghavachari and his wife Rajalakshmi in Chennai (then known as Madras) in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Graduating from Presidency College, Chennai in chemistry, he continued at the institution for his master's degree for which he studied under B. B. Dey, his topic of research being isoquinolines. After completing his master's degree, he enrolled for PhD, again under D. D. Dey at the same institution, and secured the degree from Madras University while working as an assistant to his guide on a CSIR-funded project for the production of dye and drug intermediates by electrolytic processes. Obtaining a scholarship from the Government of Madras, he went to the US in 1946 and did his post-doctoral studies at the University of Illinois, Urbana under the guidance of Roger Adams, best known for lending his name to Adams's catalyst which was prepared for the first time by him in association with V. Voorhees. Govindachari's stay with Adams lasted three years during which time he assisted the US scientist in column chromatography, collection of fractions and their examination for the latter's investigation of the structures of alkaloids found in the various species of Senecioneae. In 1949, Govindachari returned to India and in January the next year, he joined Presidency College as an additional professor at the department of chemistry. He served the institution for the next thirteen years during which period, he became a professor in 1952 and the principal of the college in 1961. He superannuated from service in 1962, and after a year, he joined the Research Center of Ciba- Geigy in Mumbai in 1963 as its director. His association with the center continued till 1975 when he returned to Chennai to serve as a consultant to Central Leather Research Institute and after two years, Amrutanjan, a pharmaceutical company, assigned him the responsibility of setting up an R&D; facility for them in Chennai. He headed the facility since its inception in 1977 till 1986 when the Science Foundation of Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation entrusted him the responsibility of establishing a research centre for them. He set up the Centre for Agrochemical Research in 1987 and held its directorship till his last. Govindachari was married to Rajamani and the couple had three children, T. G. Rajagopalan, T. G. Sundararajan and Anuradha Jagannathan. He died on 28 December 2001, aged 86, at his home town of Chennai, survived by his children; his wife had predeceased him.  Legacy  Neem (Azadirachta indica) It is reported that his involvement with the structural elucidation of alkaloids at Roger Adams' laboratory strengthened Govindachari's conviction to continue his researches along the same lines. Back in India, he continued working on alkaloids, terpenoids and oxygen heterocycles and worked on isoquinolines, phenathridines, benzophenanthridines, pridophenanthridines, dibenzoquinolizines, terpenes, flavones and furocoumarins. Tylophorine from Tylophora, tiliacorine from Tiliacora, Echitamine from Alstonia, Ropsine from Kopsia, Gentianine from Gentiana, karpaine from Carica and ancistroclaline from Ancistrocladus are some of the compounds structurally elucidated by him. He also worked on Azadirachta indica for isolating its constituents. At Presidency College, he mentored a number of research scholars which included Kuppuswamy Nagarajan, N. S. Narasimhan, N. Arumugam, B. S. Thyagarajan, M. V. Lakshmikantham, K. W. Gopinath, S. Rajappa, N. Viswanathan and P. C. Parthasarathy who all went on to become notable chemists. During his tenure at Ciba-Geigy Research Center, the institution was reported to have examined over 10,000 plant extracts and compounds which resulted in the development of 5 drugs, including Sintamil and Satranidazole, both already released into Indian market. His investigations on Wedelia calendulacea returned the isolation of wedelolactone having a novel furocoumarin structure with a pterocarpan template, which, though declared inactive during the initial tests at Abbott Laboratories, later found out to have antihepatitic properties. This was subsequently confirmed by H. Wagner, a German phytochemist. He established two research centres, the R&D; facility for Amrutanjan Healthcare and Centre for Agrochemical Research for SPIC Science Foundation and at the former, he contributed to the development of an extraction and purification process for Vinca alkaloids.

Early life  Bravo was born in New York City, the daughter of Ana Mar√≠a Ford and Rafael √Ångel Landers. Her parents, who are tailors, are both from Latin America. From the time she was three months old to a teenager, she grew up on an Army base in Panama City, Panama, until she was 13 years old, when her family moved back to the United States. She spent time going back and forth between the United States and Panama throughout her childhood. Bravo attended New York University, where she majored in directing and design for theater, which included costume and set design. She also studied acting at New York University's Playwrights Horizons Theater School.  Career  After graduating from college Bravo worked as a stylist and wardrobe designer. Bravo got her start writing and directing a series of short films. Her first film, Eat, which debuted at the 2011 SXSW Film Festival and was picked up by Vice, and starred Katherine Waterston and Brett Gelman. The film told the story of a woman who is locked out of her apartment and meets an odd neighbor. Her second film, the 2013 dark comedy named Gregory Go Boom, was shown at the Sundance Film Festival and featured Michael Cera as a paraplegic who lives near the Salton Sea. The film was shot on location in Bombay Beach and Slab City, California. Bravo worked with JASH to produce and release the film online. The film's title was inspired by the 1976 Fran√ßois Truffaut film, Small Change, where the boy falls out the window yet survives. Her third short film, 2014's Pauline Alone, features Gaby Hoffmann as a Craigslist-obsessed woman. In 2014, she was named one of Filmmaker magazine's \\"25 New Faces of Independent Film\\". In 2015, Bravo shot a featurette on Victoria Beckham for Glamours 25th Anniversary Women of the Year Awards called \\"Victoria Beckham Is Living a Life Filled with Style and Grace\\". In 2016, Bravo released the short film, Hard World for Small Things, a live-action virtual reality film that was a \\"day in the life\\" depiction of South Central. The project was grant funded by Eve Cohen and James Kaelan of Seed and Spark. The film was inspired by the death of a cousin, visiting from Panama, who in the summer of 1999 was asphyxiated by the police in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn is a case of mistaken identity. It was shot using GoPro cameras for the virtual reality company Wevr, and was shown at the Sundance Film Festival, Tribeca Film Festival, and the AFI Festival Los Angeles. The title of the film was inspired by a line of dialog in the 1955 film noir film, The Night of the Hunter, and marked a distinct departure in theme, as it focused on race and politics. Also in 2016, Bravo took the short, Woman in Deep, to the 2016 SXSW Film Festival. The film stars Alison Pill and was grant-funded via The Nantucket Project. In 2016, Bravo directed her first feature, an independent film called Lemon, which she co-wrote with then-husband Brett Gelman. The film stars Gelman, Michael Cera, and Judy Greer, and includes performances by Nia Long, Fred Melamed, Shiri Appleby, Rhea Perlman, David Paymer, Gillian Jacobs, Megan Mullally, Martin Starr, Jeff Garlin, and Marla Gibbs. After a somewhat turbulent pre-production process, the film was picked up by Killer Films and Burn Later Productions and premiered at Sundance in 2017. In addition to creating her own work, Bravo directed season 1 episode 9, \\"Juneteenth\\", of the FX television show Atlanta, which stars and was created by Donald Glover, as well as season 3 episode 5, \\"Bertie's Birthday\\", of the Netflix television show Love, which was created by and stars Paul Rust.  Personal life  In December 2015, Bravo married her long-time boyfriend, actor Brett Gelman. Gelman and Bravo met in New York City while working on a New York Lotto commercial. They live in Los Angeles. She speaks Spanish fluently and is Latin American. Gelman describes Bravo as being Jewish and Black and Panamanian. They divorced in 2019.

Evolving from the former group the Rainbows, the Marquees included Marvin Gaye and backed musicians such as Bo Diddley and Billy Stewart. The group also recorded as the New Moonglows with singer Harvey Fuqua. History The group evolved from another doo wop group known as the Rainbows, who had an influential presence on the Washington D.C. music scene and released three singles for Bobby Robinson's Red Robin Records. Although the Rainbows were not very commercially successful on a national level, songs such as \\"Mary Lee\\", \\"Shirley,\\" and \\"Minnie\\" have since become collectors' favorites. Founder of the Rainbows, Chester Simmons (bass), formed the Marquees with singers who had occasionally performed in his former group, including Reese Palmer (first tenor), Marvin Gay (second tenor, baritone; he would change the spelling to \\"Gaye\\" when he became a soloist), and James Nolan (baritone). Simmons had partnered with Gay to join the Marquees, a name proposed by Gay himself, after he had recently returned from the United States Air Force in early 1957. The group performed in the D.C. area and soon were introduced to Bo Diddley, who began working with the Marquees in his home recording studio. Diddley assigned the Marquees to Columbia subsidiary label Okeh Records after unsuccessfully attempting to get the group signed to his own label, Chess. On September 25, 1957, the group entered CBS Building in New York City to record five songs. Among them, were \\"Wyatt Earp\\" and \\"Hey Little School Girl\\", backed by Diddley's band, as well as \\"Billy's Heartaches\\" and \\"Baby, You're My Only Love\\", which had the Marquees record with singer Billy Stewart. Re-recorded versions of \\"Wyatt Earp\\" and \\"Hey Little School Girl\\" and Stewart's sides were released in November 1957; however, Okeh completely ignored the records and they quickly fell out of public notice. Despite the commercial flop, Simmons, who was previously a driver for Diddley, was able to chauffeur Harvey Fuqua in late 1958, who informed Simmons his group the Moonglows were on the verge of disbanding. In January 1959, once the original Moonglows concluded a series of performances at the Apollo Theater, Fuqua formed the New Moonglows with the Marquees. The group toured across the US, recruiting bass singer Chuck Barksdale, previously of the Dells, while in Chicago. With Fuqua, the New Moonglows recorded six sides for Chess, releasing \\"Twelve Months of the Year\\" paired with \\"Don't Be Afraid to Love\\", a tune which featured the old Moonglows group. Additionally the group, minus Fuqua and Barksdale, backed Chuck Berry on \\"Almost Grown\\" and \\"Back in the U.S.A.\\" as well as Diddley on \\"I'm Sorry\\". By mid-1959, the group was scheduled to appear on Dick Clark's television program American Bandstand; however, Fuqua was contractual obligated to perform with his former line-up. In 1960, the New Moonglows released their follow-up single, \\"Mama Loochie\\", which was Gay's first lead vocal recording. As a result of a lack of commercial success and Fuqua's interest to establish his own record label, the group disbanded soon after. Gay relocated to Detroit with Fuqua where he signed with Tri-Phi Records as a session musician, before achieving tremendous success as a solo artist. Simmons became an independent record producer in the mid-1960s. References Category:Doo-wop groups Category:1957 establishments in Washington, D.C.

Overview  Indigenous planning has a broader and more comprehensive scope than mainstream or Western planning, and is not limited to land use planning or physical development. Indigenous planning is comprehensive and can address all aspects of community life through community development, including the social and environmental aspects that impact the lives of community members. Indigenous planning for land and resources can be understood as transformative planning as it addresses complex issues of Indigenous sovereignty, self-government, and self-determination. Indigenous planning can also be understood as a form of insurgent planning, as it provides an avenue for communities to confront and address their own oppression. Indigenous planning is often a tool which allows for Indigenous communities to regain control over resources and exercise maintenance of their culture and political autonomy. The scope of Indigenous planning can be seen to cover three broad areas: Indigenous communities, urban Indigenous communities, land and resource planning.  History  Indigenous peoples have been planning their communities for thousands of years, often referred to as 'since time immemorial'. However, planning as a technical and colonial tool has historically been used as a means to dispossess Indigenous communities through the re-appropriation of traditional territories for non-Indigenous profit and development. While pre-contact Indigenous community planning was based upon managing interactions with the natural world, it now largely focuses on interactions with non-Indigenous actors. As such, Indigenous planning has re-emerged as a reaction to Western planning, which was historically used as a colonial tool, for example through the reserve system in Canada. Indigenous planning emerged as a planning culture and field of practice during the mid-20th century within the context of modern planning. It is a continually evolving practice and spans (but is contextually unique to) Indigenous communities around the world. According to John Friedmann, Indigenous planning emerged as a formalized field in relation to mainstream planning in 1992 at a MIT conference through the creation of a theory of action that was based on long-term learning, local planning and shared culture. Three years later, in 1995, the Indigenous Planning Network was created under the American Planning Association (APA); the division is currently called Indigenous Planning (IP). Contemporary Indigenous planning practices are particularly prevalent in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and the United States (countries with large Indigenous populations and colonial histories). Histories of colonization have significantly impacted Indigenous communities and their planning cultures. International colonial processes are complex, divergent, and context specific. The large scale and ongoing impacts of these processes include but are not limited to: dispossession from land and retrenchment of decision making power, intergenerational trauma, systematic racism, and disruptions of local and traditional cultural systems. Taiaiake Alfred asserts that it is essential to differentiate between Indigenous and Western planning cultures that are implicated within colonial legacies. Generally, Western planning cultures have tended to value linear systems of rationality, with power structures that dominate and suppress those cultures that do not share these value systems. Since colonization processes took place throughout the world, Indigenous planning cultures were largely ignored and actively disrupted as they were seen as impediments to western civilisation and progress. The culture of Indigenous planning is described as a movement where Indigenous communities, planners, academics, governments, institutions, and leaders, resist colonial and neo-colonial planning traditions as well as work towards increasing protections of rights, freedoms, and sovereignty for Indigenous peoples.  Principles  Some of the key principles of Indigenous planning that are distinguishable from 'mainstream' or Western planning approaches, are its recognition and incorporation of traditional knowledge, cultural identity, customary law, and Indigenous world-views. As collective land-based peoples, land tenure and stewardship are at the core of Indigenous planning paradigms. Indigenous communities everywhere have sustained and developed distinct, fluid and evolving planning cultures that are unique to land, history, and peoples. These cultural planning practices include land stewardship, resource management, community planning, and intergenerational learning transfers such as traditional ecological knowledge. Indigenous planning cultures often hold traditional governance structures, including: matrilineal heritage or consensus based decision making; self-reliance and resiliency; and, reciprocity and ceremony. Complex relationships with time exist, with strong emphases on cyclical patterns, such as nature-human relational processes and the Seven Generation Sustainability methodology. Strength-based practices and wellness planning lenses are employed, rather than a negative or weakness based assessment framework. Many of these Indigenous cultures evoke particular planning methods, including: Transformational Planning, Participatory Planning, Therapeutic Planning, Cultural Humility, and Reconciliation. The Indigenous planning culture is an intersectional, placed-based approach and political movement that is shaping western and mainstream urban planning cultures. Paullette Regan discusses the process of changing Canadian planning culture through the efforts of non- Indigenous Canadians to decolonize their personal beliefs and behaviours. Ryan Walker and Hiringi Matunga use case studies from Canada and New Zealand to discuss how planners might be able to re-situate Indigenous and mainstream planning cultures as a partnership in urban contexts. The reclamation of Indigenous planning cultures challenges western planning assumptions and many planners worldwide are questioning how non-indigenous and indigenous planners can work collaboratively towards planning practices that are reconciliatory, respectful, creative and culturally responsive. Examples of Specific Indigenous Peoples=Australia In Australia, land councils are regional organizations representing Indigenous Australians. While the primary function is to advocate for traditional land rights, the work of many land councils extends to community development plans and programs, which focus on the economic, social and cultural well-being of Indigenous Australians. Canada Some Canadian First Nations engage in Indigenous planning through an approach known as Comprehensive Community Planning (CCP). CCP is a community-led and community-owned process. As a planning exercise, CCP takes a holistic and long-term approach that considers all aspects of the community, for example: housing, health, culture, economy, land use, resources, education, language revitalization and governance. CCP can also be a way for Indigenous communities to engage formally with government organizations who provide external resources and funding for First Nations projects. Comprehensive Community Plans are living documents designed to reflect and respond to the changing priorities and goals of the community. The En'owkinwixw process is a traditional method of facilitating \\"collective learning and community decision-making\\" used by Syilx communities in Okanagan, British Columbia. The CCP for the Penticton Indian Band is an example of the En'owkinwixw process in action. The process emphasizes inclusion and equal voice in community consultation to create a common guiding framework that is culturally relevant. New Zealand The Maori in New Zealand practice Iwi Management Planning, which provides a framework for tribes to define their past and present, and prescribe \\"management, planning and decision-making processes to guide iwi toward their concept of self-determination\\". Iwi management planning and its associated policies and approaches are examples of indigenous planning done by and for Maori communities. Furthermore, Maori iwi management planning is a planning tradition that has a history that predates colonization and any ensuing acts or treaties. Contemporary Maori planning practiced today can be seen as a \\"dual planning tradition\\" where the nature of planning in the context of colonization continues to evolve while remaining grounded in Maori tradition and philosophy. United States In Hawai'i there is a trend towards the traditional Ahupua ªa concept of land management, particularly with watershed planning.  Academic programs  Several planning schools have incorporated Indigenous planning focuses into their curriculum. Some build relationships with Indigenous communities on whose lands they exist. For example, the University of British Columbia, School of Community and Regional Planning maintains a partnership with the Musqueam Indian Band. Planning schools which offer Indigenous planning curricula are often interested in updating professional planning education and practice through approaches involving the native ideals and perspectives of decolonization and reflexivity. Academic institutions with Indigenous planning-focused curricula include: * James Cook University (Graduate Certificate of Planning and Indigenous Communities) * Queen's University (School of Urban and Regional Planning - Planning with Indigenous Peoples Research Group) * University of Auckland (Bachelor of Urban Planning (Honours) - MƒÅori urban planning) * University of British Columbia (School of Community and Regional Planning - Indigenous Community Planning program) * University of New Mexico (School of Architecture and Planning - Indigenous Design and Planning Institute) * University of Northern British Columbia (School of Environmental Planning - First Nations planning specialization) * University of Saskatchewan (Bachelor of Arts - Community Planning and Native Studies) * Vancouver Island University (Master of Community Planning - First Nations planning focus area) * University of Manitoba (Department of City Planning - Indigenous Planning Studio) * University of Waterloo (Department of Planning - Indigenous Peoples and Community Planning - Special topic course) * See also * Aboriginal peoples in Canada * Architecture * Environmental planning * Indian Americans * Indigenous peoples * Indigenous Australians * Local economic development * MƒÅori people * Participatory planning * Planning cultures * Strategic planning * Urban planner * Urban planning * Urban planning education * Urban planning in Australia * Urban planning in the United States  References  Category:Urban planning ","title":"Indigenous planning"},{"id":"52202252","text":"Aurora Springs is an unincorporated community in northern Miller County, in the U.S. state of Missouri.

Founded in 2015 by Alex Garden and Julia Collins as an automated pizza delivery company, the company announced in January 2020 that it was ending pizza production and changing focus to food packaging and provision of automated production and delivery systems to food producers. Pizza business Zume Pizza was founded in 2015 by Chairman and CEO Alex Garden and Julia Collins. Started in an industrial building in Mountain View, California, by January 2020 it had expanded deliveries throughout the San Francisco Bay Area and also had offices in San Francisco and in Seattle, Washington. The company used robots for many stages of pizza production. Initially, humans shaped the pizza dough and added toppings; the pizzas were cooked en route in a van equipped with 56 GPS-equipped automated ovens, timed to be ready shortly before arrival at the address, and then sliced by a self- cleaning robot cutter. The company secured a patent on the cooking of food during delivery, which includes predictive algorithms to anticipate customer choices, and planned to partner with other businesses to also provide other robot-prepared meal components, such as salads and desserts. Zume was successful in raising capital. The company is reported to have raised $6 million in Series A investment funding in 2016, some from Jerry Yang and some from SignalFire, a venture capital firm that identifies investment opportunities using machine learning. In fall 2017, Zume Pizza raised $48 million in Series B funding. In November 2018, the company raised $375 million from SoftBank, giving it a valuation of $2.25 billion. In late 2019, some investors believed it was worth up to $4 billion. In April 2018, the company announced that it would be expanding beyond pizza and planned to begin licensing its automation technology. It subsequently also began selling food packaging; it holds patents for sustainable pizza boxes. Rebranding In early January 2020, Zume announced that it was ending pizza production and refocusing the company as a provider of packaging and automated production and delivery systems to other food companies; the changes entailed laying off 53% of the company's workforce, and potentially more.

In 1891 Lazar took the name of Lukijan when he was tonsured as a monk according to the tenets of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Shortly after he was elevated to archimandrite of the Beoƒçin monastery. In 1892 he was named Bishop of the Eparchy of Buda in Budapest. On 22 September 1908 when his mother's kin Patriarch Georgije (Brankoviƒá) died, Lukijan was elected to the post of Serbian Patriarch with see at Sremski Karlovci. He immediately undertook several important measures to reform the economy and administration of numerous monasteries in the Karlovci Metropolitanate as well as to improve the educational level of monks by opening monastic schools. In the early twentieth century, Patriarch Lukijan was viewed by Hungarian and Austrian authorities more of a political than a religious figure. This was perhaps common among all newly independent Balkan states where, as a rule, the church came to be seen primarily as a nationalizing and patriotic force. Serbs and other Orthodox Slavs constituted the largest demographic group within Bosnia and Herzegovina and the portion of the former Milit√§rgrenze (Military Frontier) that ran from Dalmatian hinterland through Croatia, Slavonia and Vojvodina. Serb successes during the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 had a significant impact on both Hungarians and Austrians alike. Istv√°n Tisza became prime minister of Hungary for the second time on 10 June 1913. During this period of the Second Balkan War waged between Bulgaria and Serbia, he wanted to solidify the government by suspending the Serbian Orthodox Church's autonomy and Church Council at the Metropolitanate of Karlovci, then within the Hungarian crown lands. He was awarded the Order of Saint Sava. Death Patriarch Lukijan went to Bad Gastein to seek redress but was mysteriously killed in a heinous manner. His headless body was found floating in a river on 1 September 1913. The killers of the patriarch were never found or brought to justice because World War I soon broke out and four years later the Habsburg Empire dissolved.

Origin The 'Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms' is one of the two most powerful martial arts of the Beggar's Sect, with the other being the Dog Beating Staff (ÊâìÁãóÊ£íÊ≥ï). The technique is believed to be based on the principles of the I Ching, an ancient text from the Western Zhou period. The skill is passed down from leader to leader of the Beggar's Sect, and the leader of the Beggar's Sect is expected to have a mastery of both the Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms and the Dog Beating Staff.  Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils  The 'Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms' first appeared in the Jin Yong novel, Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils. It is the main skill of Xiao Feng, the leader of the Beggar's Sect and one of the main characters of the novel. Originally, there were twenty eight palms in the technique, but with the help of his sworn brother Xu Zhu, Xiao Feng combined certain stances and movements and simplified it to eighteen palms. Following Xiao Feng's death at the end of the novel, Xu Zhu passed on the knowledge of the 'Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms' to the new successor of the Beggar's Sect. Legend of the Condor Heroes  In Legend of the Condor Heroes, the 'Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms' was taught to Guo Jing, the main character of the novel by Hong Qigong, the leader of the Beggar's Sect. The technique would later become Guo Jing's main fighting style, and he would use it against powerful opponents such as Ouyang Feng, Mei Chaofeng, Huang Yaoshi, and Qiu Qianren.  Return of the Condor Heroes  The 'Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms' were used by Guo Jing multiple times and by Hong Qigong against his final battle against Ouyang Feng in Return of the Condor Heroes.  Heavenly Sword and Dragon Sabre  In Heavenly Sword and Dragon Sabre, the 'Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms' is practiced by Shi Huolong, the leader of the Beggar Sect. However, he only mastered 12 of the 18 palm techniques. Shi Houlong uses the technique after he is ambushed by Cheng Kun, the main antagonist. In popular culture The 'Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms' is one of the most well known martial arts in the wuxia genre, and has been featured in many wuxia themed movies, television, and video games, such as the Stephen Chow film King of Beggars and the popular online game Age of Wushu. It's also briefly referenced at the end of Kung Fu Hustle, another Stephen Chow film.

Then, in the early 1920s, he attended the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he befriended Zona Gale and Marianne Moore, fellow poet and editor of The Dial literary magazine.

Constructed in 1909, The building was built on the recently regraded northeast corner of Second Avenue and Virginia Streets by Scott Calhoun (1874-1952), a well known attorney and Seattle's Corporation Counsel who helped form the Port of Seattle. He commissioned prominent local Architect W.P. White to design an eight-story hotel building, containing 153 rooms on the upper floors and retail at ground level. It was the first building to be completed on the site of the Denny Regrade. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 23, 2013. Converted to apartments by the 1980s, In 2014 it was restored back into a hotel and is currently run by the Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants brand as the Kimpton Palladian Hotel. History Scott Calhoun was born in Port Townsend, Washington in 1874, one of nine children to Dr. & Mrs. George Villars Calhoun, who came to Washington State in 1865 from New Brunswick, Canada via Maine. The family first settled in Port Angeles to take charge of the Marine Hospital, which George soon relocated back to Port Townsend, where it and the customs house had been forcibly removed from several years before. The family relocated to Seattle in 1876 where George opened a private practice in Pioneer Square. In 1879 the family relocated again to La Conner where they all remained until returning to a very different Seattle in 1896. Meanwhile, the young Scott Calhoun had relocated to California to study law at the new Stanford University where he was among the first class to graduate in 1892. He would spend the next few years going back and forth between Seattle and San Francisco, establishing a law office in the Starr-Boyd Building on First Avenue. Spurred on by accounts of the Klondike Gold Rush from his brother, Scott relocated to Seattle for good and soon began acquiring real estate in the city as well as pursuing an attorney position in city government. He was appointed City Tax Attorney in 1904 and by 1905 was named city Corporation Counsel where he proved himself as an influential and popular public speaker. In this position he became involved in many of the ordinances surrounding the multiple regrading and rezoning projects happening around the city at the time, affecting thousands of properties in the city, including his own. In 1909 Calhoun commissioned noted local architect W.P. White to design an 8-story, $150,000 hotel for his property at the Northeast corner of 2nd Avenue and Virginia Street, in an area recently leveled by the Denny Regrade and poised to become the new heart of Seattle's commercial core. His design was for a restrained Beaux Arts building composed of dark red brick, trimmed with white terra cotta and crowned by a projecting metal cornice. A building permit was issued in May 1909 and construction began immediately by contractor Sherman G. Combs. The McClintic-Marshall Construction Company under the direction of engineer C.F. Boyce was in charge of fabricating the hotel's 375-ton steel frame. The Denny-Renton Clay and Coal Company provided the building's external cladding. With construction wrapping up by early 1910, Calhoun's building was the first new building completed in the Denny Regrade neighborhood. Despite the building's completion, the hotel itself didn't open until October 1910 under lease to Lillie B. Wisner, previously the manager of the Hotel Stander. The new hotel boasted 153 rooms for short-term and long- term guests with hardwood finish throughout and tiled bathrooms. Within a month of opening, Calhoun sold the hotel to the Interlaken Land Company for $265,000 as well as $160,000 worth of lots in the company's new subdivision near today's Interlaken Park, which he turned around and sold for quick profit. By 1912, management of the hotel was taken over by veteran caterer J. Guerrieri, who overhauled the cafe, turning the hotel into a social destination for guest speakers, tea parties, masquerade dances and book clubs. The hotel remained popular through a succession of managers throughout the 1910s and 1920s. In 1928 part of the mezzanine level in the lobby was remodeled into a suite of studios for radio Station KVL which sent out its first broadcast on June 22 with a dedication address by governor Roland H. Hartley. By the 1980s the Hotel was exclusively apartments and in 1984 it was bought by Palladian Associates, who changed the name to the Palladian Apartments, apparently inspired by the Palladian windows on the building's mezzanine level. In 2014 the current owners undertook an entire restoration and conversion of the building back into a hotel, though keeping the Palladian name. The 97-room Palladian Hotel is currently run by the Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants brand.

He was the eldest son of duke Tr·ªãnh Ki·ªÉm and had a title Marquis Tu·∫•n ƒê·ª©c (‰øäÂæ∑‰æØ). In February 1570, Tr·ªãnh Ki·ªÉm has died, so emperor L√™ Anh T√¥ng gave Tr·ªãnh C·ªëi the authority with new title Duke ƒê·∫°t Nghƒ©a (Áæ©ÈÅîÂÖ¨). However, some officials and generals didn't comply with Tr·ªãnh C·ªëi, so they supported his younger brother Tr·ªãnh T√πng. April 1570, officials L√™ C·∫≠p ƒê·ªá, Tr·ªãnh Vƒ©nh Thi·ªáu, Tr·ªãnh B√°ch, Phan C√¥ng T√≠ch with their inferiors went to Tr·ªãnh T√πng's house and advised him to plot a coup d'√©tat. At first Tr·ªãnh T√πng pretended refusing for the suffering, then he agreed completely. After the Northern dynasty heard the news about a confusion in Thanh Hoa, Emperor M·∫°c M·ª•c T√¥ng had assigned Prince M·∫°c K√≠nh ƒêi·ªÉn to lead 100,000 soldiers with 700 warships to attack Southern dynasty. In August 1570, all of Thanh Hoa produced a stir. M·∫°c forces came on waterfronts Linh Tr√†ng, Chi Long, H·ªôi Tri·ªÅu and occupied B√∫t C∆∞∆°ng village easily and quickly. Northern dynasty garrisoned in H√† Trung, both parties faced about 10 miles. So Tr·ªãnh C·ªëi was caught between M·∫°c forces and Tr·ªãnh T√πng, and he was reluctant to surrender to M·∫°c K√≠nh ƒêi·ªÉn. Immediately the M·∫°c forces cancelled marching orders, Tr·ªãnh C·ªëi directed his mother, wives, children and inferiors about 1,000 persons to follow marshal M·∫°c K√≠nh ƒêi·ªÉn in the backing ƒê√¥ng Kinh. Emperor M·∫°c M·ª•c T√¥ng had conferred him a title Marquis Trung L∆∞∆°ng (‰∏≠ËâØ‰æØ) and his inferiors \\"duke\\". All of them had been banished to the capital. In September 1584, Tr·ªãnh C·ªëi died. The M·∫°c dynasty declared the provisional truce, then consigned Southern dynasty Tr·ªãnh C·ªëi's bones for the entombing.

It lived during the early Cretaceous period (Hauterivian epoch, about 130 million years ago), and its fossils have been found in Russia. Description Although fragmentary, the fossils of this animal have enough to differentiate it from other similar plesiosaurs. Makhaira must have measured about long, and like its other relatives, must have had a compact body with four large paddle-like limbs. The skull was elongated, particularly in the rostral area, with several sharp teeth. The characteristics of these teeth are unique, they are triangular in cross view and had carinae or grooves with denticles at the edges, which possessed a height greater than its width. Denticles varied in length along the ridge and formed a kind of undulation in the edge of the tooth. The first tooth protruded from the premaxilla, while the mandibular symphysis (the part of the jaw in which both rami meet) was very long and had more than ten tooth sockets on each side. The face was long and straight, devoid of any lateral expansion. Teeth and mandible of Makhaira rossica. Classification Makhaira rossica was first described in 2015, based on fossil remains recovered near the Volga River in the Ulyanovsk Oblast, in Russia. This reptile was evidently a representative of the pliosaurids, a group of plesiosaurs characterized by their short neck and large head. Unlike most other Cretaceous pliosaurids, Makhaira was not large; it seems to be close to the origin of the clade known as Brachaucheniinae, which includes Brachauchenius and Megacephalosaurus, which lived a few million years later and reached larger sizes. Paleobiology Makhaira was probably a predator of relatively large animals, as suggested by the slightly curved and serrated teeth. The peculiar teeth of Makhaira suggests that it fed on different types of prey, compared to other Cretaceous pliosaurids. The characteristics of the teeth of Makhaira are also very similar to those of metriorhynchids crocodylomorphs and raise the question of whether these were still present at the end of the Cretaceous, as suggested by the discovery of an isolated tooth from the Aptian of Sicily, Italy.

He was known for conducting research on the attention spans of school-aged children, and he set up the first psychological laboratory in Japan. Born in Sanda, Hy≈çgo, Motora studied at Boston University and completed a Ph.D. in philosophy at Johns Hopkins University, but his studies also included significant work on physiological psychology with G. Stanley Hall. After graduate school, he returned to Japan, where he served on the faculty of the Tokyo Imperial University, later known as the University of Tokyo. There he taught a number of students who became influential psychologists and academics. A practitioner of Zen meditation, he wrote that understanding meditation should be based on a participant's own interpretation rather than the ideas of a Zen master. He also translated the works of eminent Western psychologists into Japanese and conducted early work in clinical psychology. Motora was still an active researcher and professor when he contracted a fatal case of erysipelas in his mid-fifties. Early life Motora was born into a samurai caste in Sanda, Hy≈çgo to Yutaka Sugita and Suga (Motoyama) Sugita, and he had an older brother. As a child, Motora was interested in the West and studied English in school. He was attracted to psychology after reading a textbook written by physiologist William Benjamin Carpenter. In 1879, Motora became a teacher at the Tokyo Eiwa School. Two years later, he married Yone Motora, and her family adopted him. He took up her religion, converting from the Congregational Church to Methodism. When he joined his wife's family, his social status changed from samurai class to commoner. In 1883, Motora came to the United States to study philosophy and theology. He studied at Boston University, a choice influenced by the Tokyo Eiwa School's being established as a mission school of Boston University. In late 1885, Motora spoke at two churches in Decatur, Illinois, telling the congregations that he hoped his education in Boston would prepare him to return to Japan and convert people to Christianity. The Decatur newspaper, which referred to Motora as \\"the Jap. preacher\\", said that the churches collected money to defray Motora's educational expenses. Work with G. Stanley Hall Dissatisfied with his education in Boston, Motora went to Johns Hopkins University to study under experimental psychologist G. Stanley Hall. Around that time, Hall's laboratory was home to several students who went on to become prominent academics, including Edmund Sanford, Clifton F. Hodge, and James H. Hyslop. When Motora applied to Johns Hopkins, he indicated a particular interest in physiological psychology. However, his interests shifted once he got to the school. While he still studied under Hall, he majored in philosophy. His thesis was titled Exchange: Considered as the Principles of Social Life. Beginning in the mid-1880s, Motora translated new theories of Western psychology ‚Äì such as the James‚ÄìLange theory and Wilhelm Wundt's three-dimensional theory of feelings ‚Äì for publication in Japan. Though he had translated Wundt's work, Motora came to believe that emotion was a product of only one dimension: pleasure versus displeasure. Despite his emphasis on philosophy, Motora maintained some interest in physiological psychology. When Japanese psychologist Sho Watase visited Motora in the U.S., he and two of Motora's colleagues were given helmets with electrical wires on them. The men wore the helmets to bed for several nights in an attempt to share the electrical output of their brains with one another. Motora thought that this might cause the men to experience the same dreams. \\"It was our opinion that the fault might not be with the doctor's theory, but rather with ourselves, for the helmets often came off while we were asleep as we were restless,\\" Watase said, adding that Motora never brought up such an experiment to him again. Motora and Hall collaborated on an 1888 study of the skin's sensitivity to changes in pressure; their paper was published in the first issue of the American Journal of Psychology. Hall later remembered Motora as a modest and reserved student who seemed to have few interests outside of his studies in philosophy and psychology. Motora earned a Ph.D. in philosophy in 1888. Academic career Coming back to Japan after his doctoral studies, Motora became principal of the Tokyo Eiwa School. Shortly thereafter, he also took a part-time faculty position at Tokyo Imperial University. In 1889, Motora presented a lecture on evolutionary theory at the Tokyo Eiwa School, but the lecture ran afoul of their religious tradition established by Methodist missionaries. Motora resigned from the school, devoting his attention to lecturing full-time at Tokyo Imperial University. By 1890, Motora authored Psychology, the first Japanese scientific textbook in his field. The same year, Motora was promoted to the rank of professor at Tokyo Imperial University, though there was not a full psychology department at the time. He was named the chair of psychology, ethics and logic three years later. In 1895, Motora kept a journal of a week-long period practicing Zen meditation at Engaku-ji, a Buddhist temple in Tokyo. Zen meditation involves the use of a k≈çan, a prompt that can be used to assess a student's progress in Zen. Motora's k≈çan was \\"What is the sound of clapping with only one hand?\\" Motora required 16 attempts and a hint from the Zen master before he was able to provide an answer that satisfied the Zen master. He later wrote that Zen should be understood through personal interpretation rather than through a Zen master, and this became an influential thought in early Japanese psychology. In 1903, with the assistance of one of his former students, Matatar≈ç Matsumoto, Motora set up Japan's first formal laboratory in experimental psychology at the university. They had a spare room in Motora's office building that could have been used for research, but the acoustics of the room created too much noise for psychological experiments, and soon Motora and Matsumoto converted a 12-room house from the school's pathology department into a psychology lab. While working with school-aged children who were thought to be mentally retarded, Motora found that students who had difficulties with academic achievement were much more likely to be suffering from attention span problems than mental retardation. Motora invented a device that would help children sustain their concentration. He authored the first descriptions in the Japanese literature of a condition consistent with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Motora was named a member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences and was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Second Class. He was selected to give a presentation at the 1905 International Congress of Psychology, where he read a paper on the concept of the self based on his experience with meditation. Prot√©g√©s Several of Motora's students became prominent academics. In 1906, Matsumoto established the psychological laboratory at Kyoto University, which was the second formal psychology lab in Japan. He later succeeded Motora as psychology faculty at Tokyo Imperial University. Chen Daqi, who came from China to study under Motora, was later responsible for the first Chinese psychology laboratory and psychology textbook. Yoshihide Kubo studied with Motora at Tokyo Imperial University before going to Clark University, where Hall had become president. When he joined the faculty at Hiroshima University, Kubo adapted the Binet-Simon intelligence test for Japanese use. His study of intelligence was furthered by another Motora pupil, Tohru Watanabe, who created Japan's first group intelligence test. Hiroshi Hayami, who also studied under Motora, brought word of behaviorism to Japan. Later, Hayami became president of Keij≈ç Imperial University. Tomokichi Fukurai, another of Motora's students, attained short- lived recognition in the field but is mostly known for his discredited work in parapsychology. Fukurai was hired to teach abnormal psychology at Tokyo Imperial University. Gradually, he became more interested in studying psychical phenomena such as clairvoyance. In the United States, scholars had already taken dismissive attitudes toward paranormal research, but Fukurai was apparently unaware of this since he had studied only in Japan. In 1910, when Fukurai insisted that he had identified three clairvoyant women, Motora tried to convince him to drop this line of research. Fukurai did not publicize his interest in the paranormal until after Motora's death in 1912. The year after Motora died, Fukurai published a controversial book about clairvoyance. Matsumoto had taken over as the department chair, and he asked Fukurai to take a leave of absence. Fukurai's employment was automatically terminated once his two-year leave expired. To prevent further damage to the department's reputation, Matsumoto removed all abnormal psychology lectures from the curriculum, focusing the department's teaching and research on psychological phenomena that could be measured through objective means. The other Imperial Universities also deemphasized the teaching of abnormal psychology through the 1930s. Thus, \\"the Fukurai affair\\" led to a change in focus that delayed the development of clinical psychology in Japan until after World War II. Motora did not conduct research in fine arts or aesthetics, but a number of alumni from his department became known for their work in this area. For example, while Matsumoto is better known as the founding president of the Japanese Psychological Association, he also became president of the Kyoto Prefectural School of Art and Crafts. Naoteru Ueno was the director of the Osaka Municipal Museum of Art and the first president of Tokyo University of the Arts. Mantaro Kido combined his interests in psychology and calligraphy, researching the application of the arts to educational psychology. Death Motora died in Tokyo on December 13, 1912. He had been sick with erysipelas for several months but had remained active in psychological research until just before his death. He and his wife had five children.

As the first Afghan President visiting Australia, Dr. Mohammad Ashraf Ghani arrived to Canberra on 2 April 2017 for an almost 3 days visit. Marking the visit, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Afghanistan and Australia had forged a ‚Äúsolid connection‚Äù for more than a century. From Afghan cameleers in the 1860s, through to the Australian military effort to free Afghanistan of terrorism, the two nations have long maintained a healthy partnership. Discussions were mainly focused on security and development co-operation.  Regional Economic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan (RECCA)  The Silk Road through Afghanistan strategy presented at the Sixth Regional Economic Cooperation Conference in Kabul, 2015. One of the efforts that have been striving to have regional economic cooperation in South and Central Asia so as to assist Afghanistan is Regional Economic Cooperation Conference on Afghanistan (RECCA). RECCA is a forum that has been managed to promote stabilization in Afghanistan and South and Central Asian regional economic integration. Waissi have been engaged on developing the first Regional Cooperation Strategy for the ANDS since 2005. This strategy made the platform for broader regional cooperation discussion among immediate neighbors and far neighboring countries of Afghanistan. The first regional economic cooperation conference under the title of RECCA has been inaugurated in Kabul in 2005. More annual RECCA meetings were hosted in New Delhi in 2006, Islamabad in 2007, Istanbul in 2009, Dushanbe in 2012 and back in Kabul in 2015. Waissi played a major role in organization and coordination of the last two RECCA events in Dushanbe and Kabul. The RECCA process in 2015 covers a broader range of economic activities in forms of energy cooperation, connectivity, and business to business opportunities in the region. Waissi and his team at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have launched a new website (www.recca.af) to include necessary information about status of projects under the RECCA process for a wider outreach. He also initiated identifying RECCA Focal Points from 16 countries for better coordination of regional project's implementation. The first meeting of the RECCA Focal Points took place on 26 August 2017 in Kabul. The Seventh RECCA meeting will be hosted by the Turkmenistan Government in Ashgabat in November 2017.  Chabahar Agreement  left Waissi was a lead- negotiator for the International Transport and Transit Corridor (also known as the 'Chabahar Agreement') on behalf of the Afghan Government since 2012, when the primary discussion over this agreement started in 2012 in Tehran between Afghanistan, Iran and India and to its signing ceremony. On 23 May 2016, the Agreement was signed in Tehran, Iran, by the Afghan Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, the Indian Minister of Shipping, Road Transport, and Highways and the Iranian Ministry of Road and Urban Development, while the three heads of states, President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, President Hassan Rouhani and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were present. The agreement later approved by the Cabinet of the Afghan Government on 3 August 2016 and ratified by the Afghan National Assembly (Parliament). The Agreement aims to: 1) Facilitate access to international markets by using land, sea, and/or air transportation through Chabahar Port; and 2) Simplify, harmonize, and standardize procedures governing the international transport and transit of goods and passengers, in accordance with the international agreements and conventions in which the three signatory governments are members. The Chabahar Agreement is the first multilateral transit and transport agreement of its kind that Afghanistan signs with other countries. It basically connects South Asia with Central Asia, and Gulf region with Central Asia and Caucasus markets. The ports in Chabahar will considerably cut transportation costs and time.  The Lapis Lazuli Route  Text of the Lapis Lazuli Route Agreement was finalized in Baku between Afghanistan, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Turkey and Turkmenistan in its fourth technical meeting on 16 November 2016 Afghanistan as a landlocked country needs more diversified transit policy. Alternative routes and corridors are always helpful for the domestic economy as well as regional connectivity. This was the biggest motivation for Waissi to initiate an alternative transit route, later called the Lapis Lazuli Transit and Transport Route. His ideas was accepted by Jawed Ludin, former Deputy Foreign Minister of Afghanistan and later by Zarar Ahmad Osmani, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan. Waissi was being appointed immediately by Minister Osmani to follow with the concerned counties and coordinate to become a party to this initiative. Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia immediately joined and Turkey was the last country to become as a party to this initiative. In early 2014 Waissi and a team of experts from the Afghan Government started the negotiation from Ashgabat in Turkmenistan. Waissi was leading the negotiation for the agreement on behalf of the Afghan Government. The Lapis Lazuli corridor was opened for business in December 2018.  Multilateralism & Multilateral Diplomacy  Wahidullah Waissi is delivering his statement on behalf of Afghan Government at the side of United Nations General Assembly in 2013 at a special event on efforts made towards achieving MDGs. Working for the Afghanistan's Aid Coordination Authority (AACA) in 2003, Waissi's main work focuses were on multilateral cooperation. He was appointed as Aid Coordination Officer at the Ministry of Finance when the AACA moved to this ministry and his areas of focus were on International Financial Institutions (IFIs) i.e. the World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and European Commission (EC) between years 2003 and 2004. In early 2004, Waissi was manager for a newly established department focussing on IFI's portfolio monitoring. Later in 2012, as Director-General for Economic Cooperation, Waissi was mainly working on multilateral diplomatic activities throughout Afghanistan's Foreign Policy principles. Waissi represented the Afghan Government at the United Nation's General Assembly debates on G7+, G77, Land-Locked Development Countries (LLDC), Least-Development Countries (LDC), special events on Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and many other events in years 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.  Sustainable Development Goals  Afghan media interviewing Wahidullah Waissi after a symposium on ‚ÄúTrade and Cooperation between Central Asia and Afghanistan‚Äù organized by the University of Central Asia and Afghanistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2012 Waissi has initiated the Sustainable Development Goals & Green Economy Desk at the department of economic cooperation of Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to promote and increase focus on Afghanistan's green diplomacy at the regional and international level. This has enabled more cooperation between Afghanistan and its partners when Afghanistan's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are developed. Waissi participate at the Rio+20 of United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development took place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 20‚Äì22 June 2012 as part of the Afghan delegation. The Government of Afghanistan has presented its position paper in support of the SDGs. In 2013 and 2014, Waissi and his team at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have inaugurated a first series of consultations on SDGs and adopting the goals to national level policies and plans. The first review of SDGs for Afghanistan has been developed in 2014 and submitted to the United Nations. The Government of Afghanistan endorsed the SDGs and presented its adoption policy of the post-2015 development agenda at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit 2015 held on 25‚Äì27 September 2015, in New York City.  Development career  Waissi's professional work focuses on economic development since 1998. He has worked for many national and international non-governmental organizations, UN agencies, and government in Kabul and provinces. Waissi has started his first government engagement in the field of aid management and budget policy. He has been responsible for most of the development partnership activities for Afghanistan since 2003 and has been directly involved in coordination and organizing of 22 national and international conferences for Afghanistan from 2004 to 2015 in Kabul, Berlin, Paris, Tokyo, Rome, London, Bonn, Brussels and in number of neighboring countries.  Afghanistan National Development Strategy  In June 2006, Waissi has been appointed as the Coordinator and Formulation Manager for the Interim-Afghanistan National Development Strategy (I-ANDS) at the Office of the Senior Economic Advisor to the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Professor Ishaq Nadiri (Former President Hamid Karzai). The I-ANDS was served as the interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) based on the World Bank development modules. The ANDS was a five-year national development plan outlined the government strategy for achieving its long-term development vision. It was based on the Afghanistan Millennium Development Goals and the benchmarks of the Afghanistan Compact. Both the MDGs and ANDS/PRSP meant to help the government and policy makers at the national and ministry levels to plan activities for reaching the priority development results required to address people's priority needs. The I-ANDS/I-PRSP was presented at the International Donor Conference in London in 2006. The Afghanistan National Development Strategy (ANDS), 2008-2013 served as Afghanistan‚Äôs Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and used the pillars, principles and benchmarks of the Afghanistan Compact (2006) as a foundation. The ANDS document was instrumental for absorbing more foreign aid for the development process of Afghanistan and presented at the Paris Conference on Afghanistan in July 2008. In July 2007, the Boards of Executive Directors of the International Development Association (IDA) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed that the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan had met the requirements for reaching the decision point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The amount of debt relief determined at the decision point was US$571.4 million on March 20, 2006 net present value (NPV) terms, calculated to reduce the NPV of eligible external debt to 150 percent of exports at March 20, 2006. This relief implied a common reduction factor of 51.0 percent. After the Paris Conference and approval of the ANDS by the boards of the World Bank and IMF in 2008, Waissi has been appointed as Director for Coordination of ANDS Implementation and Budget Policy overseeing implementation of the ANDS and its activities underlined in its National Action Plan.  Millennium Development Goals (MDG)  Results Based Budgeting  In 2008 Waissi has been appointed as the Director for ANDS Coordination of Implementation and Budget Policy at the Ministry of Finance. In late 2008 Waissi and his team at the Ministry of Finance have introduced Results Based Management (RBM) mechanism and performance budgeting into National Budget of Afghanistan for the first time between 2009 and 2011. The RBM later introduced as the Performance Budgeting at the Ministry of Finance and still continues as a budget policy tool for measuring results at the Ministry of Finance of Afghanistan.  Environmentalism = The Green Club  Wahid Waissi has had a long-standing concern with environmentalism as a national and global issue. Waissi has co-founded the Green Club in 2009 together with Jawid Omar and a team of young Afghans on voluntary basis. Waissi is the Chairman and co-founder of Green Club, Afghanistan on voluntary basis. The Green Club soon found its way to the heart and minds of youth activists focused its objectives to encourage environment protection and green knowledge by volunteerism, advocacy and awareness rising. In June 2012, Waissi participated at the Rio+20 United Nation Conference on Sustainable Development as member of the Government of Islamic Republic of Afghanistan delegation. The Green Club volunteers planted over thousands trees after the first \\"A tree for me is a tree for Afghanistan\\" planting campaign at the outskirts of Kabul city. 19 April 2010 The Green Club became the first registered civil society organizations on environment protection and sustainable development. The Green Club engaged active citizens who are concerned about environmental degradation and volunteer to make the communities green. The Green Club made its path towards Earth Day Network and owned the 2013 Earth Day International Recognition Award for its green activities. Waissi also registered a petition on Afghanistan's Independent Human Rights Commission and submitted the Right for Environment as future Human Rights Commission consideration for their annual analysis and reports. The Green Club volunteers organized several campaigns namely: A Tree for Me is a Tree for Afghanistan, Earth Day Festivals, Green Club Environment Week, Green Caravans Awareness Campaigns for schools, Run for Green Cycling Contest, Green Policy, media awareness campaigns, drawing competition at selected schools, and photography competition and exhibitions in support of the Earth Day and environment protection. More than 100 youth were engaged directly in all these campaigns all at the same time. = A Tree for Me is a Tree for Afghanistan = Waissi and the Green Club volunteers have initiated the first national tree planting campaigns using the Facebook application under the title of A Tree for Me is a Tree for Afghanistan. The Green Club volunteers planted more than ten thousand trees in Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif and Herat for five consecutive years. The Green Club volunteers organized the first Environment Week in 2011 with a social activity for a day for seven days. = National Environment Week = In 2015, Waissi and Omar have submitted a proposal to the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Mohammad Ashraf Ghani, to localize the World Environment Day to National Environment Week based on its successful model practiced by the Green Club between years of 2010 to 2014. The Cabinet of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan has approved this idea and included it into national calendar for annual celebration. Since 2015, the national environment week are being celebrated officially. = Green Policy = The Green Club has partnered with the CW4WAfghan to make its Green Policy a public document in the hopes that other organizations, agencies and companies operating in Afghanistan will also adopt similar policies. Afghanistan, and its capital city in particular, are facing an environmental crisis that puts millions of lives at risk, and significantly lowers the quality of life of Afghans. Despite the gravity of this crisis‚Äîwhich is estimated to claim far more lives than the current conflict‚Äîlittle is being done.

In two instances he was tried for manslaughter of his patients. In the first case he was found guilty and fined ¬£250, and in the second case acquitted. He died at the age of 35, reportedly from tuberculosis but perhaps merely from a horse-riding accident. Life Coloured etching by Sharpshooter,pseudonym, possibly of J. Phillips 8 September 1830, lampooning the manslaughtering quack doctor John St. John Long Long, born in Newcastle West in 1798, was the second son of John Long, basket- maker and jack-of-all-trades, by Anne St. John. He showed some gift for drawing and in 1816 some charitable local people contributed money for him to attend the Royal Dublin Society's school of design. He returned to Limerick two years later and supported himself by giving drawing lessons. In 1822 he came to London, and in 1827 began his quack medical practice which was so successful that he was shortly able to move to Harley Street. Long's treatments for tuberculosis both involved secret formulas, one inhaled, the other rubbed on the back or chest. The rubbing treatment was conducted daily for five to ten days until the patients developed a running sore, which Long said allowed the disease to leave the body. Trials Long on trial In 1830 Long was tried for the death of his patient Mrs. Catherine Cashin, age 24. Cashin's mother had visited Long to consult about her younger daughter Ellen, who was sixteen and did have tuberculosis. Preying on the mother's fears, Long convinced her to obtain treatment for Catherine as well, although Catherine appeared to be in perfect health. The wound he caused her became severely infected, and Catherine began constantly vomiting. Long prescribed mulled wine, which Catherine was unable to keep down. A Doctor Brodie was called in, over Long's objections, but Cashin died the following day. Long was tried at the Old Bailey. He argued he was not responsible and that the death was caused by Dr. Brodie's intervention and produced favorable testimony from his other patients. Nevertheless, he was found guilty of manslaughter on 23 October 1830, but was sentenced only to a fine of ¬£250, which he paid immediately. The following month Long was indicted for the manslaughter of Mrs. Colin Campbell Loyd, but was acquitted on 18 November. Death Long is said to have died of tuberculosis himself, and refused treatment by his own method, on 2 July 1834. Some of his former patients contributed to erect a monument to him at his tomb in Kensal Green Cemetery, with a complimentary inscription. He left his property, including his secret remedy (which he valued at ¬£10,000) to his brother William.

During this period, a major transport route in Japan included shipping goods from northern areas to Wakasa Bay on the Sea of Japan coast. From there they were taken overland to the ports along the northern shores of Lake Biwa and loaded onto maruko-bune. The maruko-bune then sailed south on the lake to the port of Otsu, a distance of approximately 60 km (37 miles), from where the cargo would be unloaded and taken by land to Kyoto. During their heyday in the Edo period, over 1,300 maruko-bune were working on the lake. Maruko-bune declined in numbers after 1672 with the establishment of a sea transportation route to Osaka via the Shimonoseki Strait and Seto Inland Sea, but there were still over 1,000 in operation on Lake Biwa at any one time until the end of the eighteenth century. The introduction of rail transportation around the lake in 1889 decreased their numbers considerably, but hundreds were still in use in the 1930s and a few were used into the 1960s for transporting goods locally. One maruko-bune, fitted with an engine, was retired in the late 1990s. The end to maruko-bune production, which occurred in the 1930s, was related to the decline in the availability of suitable wood. This was caused by a loss of foresters who knew where to source suitable timbers from the mountains surrounding the lake.  Construction  Maruko-bune are characterised by their rounded hulls in cross section, designed to maximise the amount of cargo they could carry without increasing draft. They were constructed with wood: Podocarpus for the bow, stern and side planking, Japanese cedar for the bottom planking, and cypress for the mast and components above deck. Two halves of a longitudinal-sawn Japanese cedar log were built into the length of the boat, one half each side, to give it stability in the often choppy waters of the lake and to act as rubrails. The planking was edge-nailed together and tree bark was used for caulking. The bow section was sharply angled and consisted of narrow planks, resembling the staves of a barrel. The bow and other parts of the boat were decorated with copper plates coated with a mixture of charcoal and rapeseed oil in a traditional pattern. The mast was square in cross section, and could be lowered when not in use. The cargo capacity of maruko-bune ranged from 30 to 300 koku (1 koku = 180 l), although most had a capacity of 80 to 100 koku. A maruko-bune with a capacity of 100 koku was about 19 m long with a mast 12 m high A 19 m long (100 koku) maruko-bune was constructed between 1992 and 1995 for an exhibit of the Lake Biwa Museum, Shiga Prefecture, Japan. The construction was supervised by Sanshiro Matsui, who was 80 years old in 1992, and who had worked in a maruko-bune boatyard during his youth.

He never rose above supporting roles, with a number of his film appearances reduced to uncredited bits.Photograph of Gregory Marshall A native of Los Angeles County, Gregory Muradian was just past his fifth birthday when the first film in which he appeared, Roughly Speaking, a comedy-drama starring Rosalind Russell and Jack Carson, started production in April 1944, finishing in mid-July. Unbilled, briefly playing the son of Russell and Carson, his character was subsequently played as an older boy by the unbilled Johnny Sheffield and, as a teenager, by Robert Arthur. During his first two years as an actor, the youngster appeared in eight additional films, with small credited roles in 1945's Captain Eddie (playing young Eddie Rickenbacker's little brother, Dewey) and Strange Confession as well as 1946's The Bride Wore Boots and Child of Divorce. In 1947 he was given a new stage name, Gregory Marshall, and supporting roles in four more films. There were seven additional films during 1948‚Äì51, with on- screen credit in two, 1949's Adventure in Baltimore and 1951's The Blue Veil. Also in 1951, his television debut, at the age of 12, in an episode of The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickock, a western series aimed at pre-teens and young adolescents, was broadcast on December 30. Marshall was seen in three films during 1952, but received billing in only one, Washington Story. Upon becoming a teenager, he found roles becoming scarce, with his only work in 1953 consisting of an episode of the popular William Bendix sitcom, The Life of Riley, playing Egbert Gillis, the son of Riley's best friend, Jim Gillis and, in 1954, there was one film, Tanganyika, along with a David Niven episode of CBS' Four Star Playhouse, airing on February 18. Although he was one of three teenage actors, along with Richard Beymer and ultimate choice Sal Mineo, tested by director Nicholas Ray for the key supporting role of the protagonist's sensitive friend Plato in 1955's Rebel Without a Cause,Rathgeb, Douglas, L. The Making of Rebel Without a Cause. McFarland, 2004 there was no work for him that year and the sole acting assignment in 1956 was another appearance as Egbert on The Life of Riley. His career was nearly over in 1957, with a 9th-billed role in the juvenile delinquency exploitation drama, Teenage Thunder.Photograph of Gregory Marshall in Teenage Thunder His final three screen acting roles came the following year, with another turn as Egbert on The Life of Riley, an episode of the syndicated series The Silent Service and an unbilled bit in the attempted revival of the Andy Hardy film series, Andy Hardy Comes Home. At the age of 19, his acting career had come to an end. Gregory Marshall died in California's Orange County city of Orange six months past his 50th birthday.

It is endemic to the Chatham Islands in New Zealand. Description The exoskeleton of Geodorcus capito varies in colour from glossy black to brownish black. Adults show distinct sexual dimorphism. Including mandibles, male beetles range in length from 17.0‚Äì27.0 mm; females from 15.0‚Äì19.5 mm. Male and female beetles can be distinguished by the distinct ribbed elytra with obvious branching setae on the male beetle, whilst a female beetle has more vague ribbed elytra and barely visible setae. Distribution This stag beetle is found throughout the Chatham Islands, including on Chatham Island, Pitt Island, Rangatira, Mangere Island and Little Mangere Island. It is now thought to be restricted to the southern end of Chatham Island and is less common on Pitt Island than previously. It is possible that vulnerable species like G. capito have been restricted in their distribution by grazing and habitat loss on Chatham Island and pig rooting on Pitt Island. Habitat All Geodorcus are nocturnal forest species. Adult G. capito beetles have been seen at night on the ground and on trees. During the day, beetles can be seen hiding under rotten branches and inside debris on tree trunks. All life cycle stages, including eggs, have been seen in moss covered cavities of trees on Chatham Island. On smaller islands adults have been collected under rocks in coastal forest. Diet From their mouthparts, it is assumed that all adult stag beetles are liquid feeders. Adult Geodorcus beetles feed on sappy exudations from trees. Stag beetle larvae consume rotting wood at or above ground but a few species live underground and feed on either roots or humus. Conservation Like other Geodorcus species, G. capito is protected under Schedule 7 of The 1953 Wildlife Act, making it an offense to collect or harm a specimen. The Chatham Island stag beetle has suffered a large reduction in its range on the inhabited Chatham Islands.  References  External links *Citizen Scientists observations of Geodorcus capito.

The film was screened at the 73rd edition of the Venice Film Festival in the Horizons section. Plot Samuel is a troubled teenager with a drug addict mother and a father he never knew. He spent the last years of his life committing thefts, robberies and assaults, entering and leaving juvenile reform school. After serving yet another sentence, he is included in a rehabilitation program: he obtains semi- release and starts working on the farm in a small town in the Roman province. His supervisor is Vincenzo, a social worker who, after the death of his wife, struggles to find his balance. His life is divided between work, his teenage daughter and the local rugby team that he, a former professional player, trains. Samuel adapts with difficulty to the rules and new rhythms of life. His relationship with Vincenzo was immediately problematic, but it was the social worker who introduced him to the world of rugby. The third half, which gives the title to the film, in rugby is the one that takes place at the end of the match: a match between opposing teams and fans. In a convivial atmosphere, based on fair play and on the recognition of mutual value, everyone celebrates together, regardless of who won or lost. This is precisely the most important phase of the game, the one that teaches the spirit of brotherhood and respect for the opponent. Values that the young protagonist, a classic bully used to living in a world based on the law of the strongest, has never learned. That of the third half is the first rule of rugby that Vincenzo teaches Samuel, showing him for the first time a world where team play is more important than solo action. A universe in which the boy does not recognize himself, but to which, little by little, he will begin to become passionate, as he never did before.

It has smooth bark, lance-shaped adult leaves arranged in opposite pairs, flower buds in groups of three, whitish flowers and cylindrical to barrel-shaped fruit.fruitleaf arrangement Description Eucalyptus extrica is a spreading mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth light grey over brown bark, sometimes with rough, fibrous or ribbony bark on the lower stems. Young plants and coppice regrowth have slightly glaucous, elliptical to egg-shaped leaves arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are also arranged in opposite pairs, lance-shaped to egg-shaped, the same dull green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arrange in leaf axils in groups of three on a flattened peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a rounded to flattened operculum. Flowering occurs between January and April and the flowers are whitish. The fruit is a woody, cylindrical to barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves near to rim level. Tallerack (E. pleurocarpa) has a similar habit but has noticeably shorter, wider, glaucous leaves, glaucous buds and fruit. Intergrades between the two species have been recorded. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus extrica was first formally described in 2000 by Dean Nicolle from a specimen collected east of Condingup by Anthony Orchard, and the description was published in the journal Nuytsia. Nicolle wrote that the specific epithet is \\"from the Latin word extrico meaning \\"disentangled\\" or \\"free\\", in reference to this species having been confused with E. tetragona in the past. Ali Sharr wrote that extrica is a non-word in Latin, and that the past participle of the Latin extrico (\\"I disentangle\\" or \\"I free\\") is extricatus. Distribution and habitat Eastern tallerack is found in coastal areas in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia between Esperance and Cape Arid where it grows in sandy soils over limestone. Conservation status This mallee is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Plot  The film starts with a flashback of protagonist Andrea's childhood, narrated by adult Andrea musing about his dislike for two particular proverbs. According to the first, there is always a first time, but for Andrea the last times are even more important‚Äîsuch as the last time he saw his father, who left the family in the middle of the night many years ago. According to the other proverb, there are seven women for every man in the world‚ÄîAndrea has them all at home, and none of them is easy to deal with: his grandmother Matilde, once a professor of astrophysics, is now suffering from dementia and depends her live-in caregiver Bogdana. His mother Vittoria, administrator of 11 condominiums, is the undisputed master of the house and nicknamed Sergeant Hartman (after the Full Metal Jacket character) for her rigorous ways. Then there are his three older sisters: Veronica, the oldest (and the only one to no longer live with her mother), is a convinced feminist with a low opinion of men. Federica, a doctor, is notoriously disorganized. She changes men every other week and habitually makes poor choices in doing so. Beatrice, who became a notary at age 22 (at the same time winning four consecutive wet T-shirt contests), is a perfectionist with a tendency to alienate people with her arrogance. Andrea grew up being second fiddle to his older sisters. Looking for permanent employment, he is supporting himself with occasional jobs. While working in a bar, he has met Roberta. However, six months into their relationship, as she is spending the night at Andrea's place and the various family members walk in on the couple at night, make them cancel a planned beach so Andrea can run some errands, criticize Roberta's cooking, destroy the computer on which Roberta had been writing her thesis, scratch her car and have it towed for being parked in front of the family's garage, and exchange her dog for another by mistake, Roberta breaks up with Andrea and storms out in anger. She leaves behind the dog, a female and now the seventh ‚Äúwoman‚Äù in Andrea's life. Beatrice is left by her fianc√© at the altar, who claims he can no longer bear a woman as flawless as her, and destroying Andrea's hope of another sister moving out. Beatrice falls into a deep depression and refuses to change out of her wedding dress. While delivering pizza to the house of a woman named Giulia and her boyfriend Paolo, he walks in on a heated argument. Giulia ends up leaving Paolo for Andrea, but to avoid losing yet another girlfriend over his difficult family, Andrea claims to be an orphan. After several near-encounters with his family, he is eventually unmasked. Giulia forgives him and is introduced to his family. As Giulia and Andrea spend time at a spa, they discover that Veronica has started an affair with a married man no other than Giulia's father. Nonetheless, Giulia's parents celebrate their wedding anniversary, to which they invite Andrea's entire family. After Andrea's sisters ruin the party, Giulia demands that Andrea decide between her and her family. Andrea declares to his family that he is leaving, packs his bags and heads for Giulia's home. But after an unexpected encounter with his father, who does not even recognize his own son, he decides to ‚Äúfix‚Äù his family before leaving for good. He encourages Federica's assistant (and potential father of the child she is expecting) to make a move towards her, and does the same to the concierge of the condominium, who has long held feelings for Vittoria but never had the courage to make a move. He provokes an argument between Veronica and Riccardo, causing the two to break up and making Veronica to realize Riccardo was never interested in a serious relationship with her. By showing Beatrice some childhood movies, he makes her realize how she has alienated other people from childhood on. After a harmonic family Christmas, he returns for Giulia, only to find that Paolo has since moved back in with her. He goes on to live on his own, and one day bumps into Roberta in a supermarket. The two decide to give it another try. Just then Andrea gets another call from his mother, but he puts the phone into a crate of lemons and walks off with Roberta. As the end credits roll, Andrea's phone receives several text messages from his family, announcing new disasters: Matilde hit a cop with her electric wheelchair and escaped, Federica has forgotten her baby at the supermarket (right after the message arrives, a loudspeaker announcement about an abandoned baby is heard in the background), Beatrice announces suicide after discovering a white hair, Veronica has fallen in love with Roberta's father, Andrea's father has returned to the family.

Before the separation of Uttarakhand in 2000, the Almora-Bageshwar stretch of this Highway was a part of the State Highway 37 of Uttar Pradesh, which ran from Bageshwar to Bareilly. History The Almora-Bageshwar stretch of this Highway was a part of the provincial 'Almora-Joshimath cart road' during the nineteenth century. The road had a steep descent on the way to Thakla (now Takula), and was surrounded by dense forests of Oak and Rhododendrons. However, the hills were covered by very fine Cheer forests between Thakla and Bageshwar. Later in 1909; several sections of the highway were recorded in the Almora Gazetter as \\"III class local roads\\", including the 24 mile 'Gangolihat to Dharamghar road' and the 22 mile 'Bageshwar to Berinag road'. Route It starts at Rameshwar and ends at Almora. The NH309A lies entirely in Uttarakhand and passes through the Districts of Pithoragarh, Bageshwar and Almora. The National Highway 309A connects cities and towns of different districts as follows: Rameshwar, Gangolihat, Berinag, Chaukori, Kanda, Bageshwar, Takula, Almora.

It is often denoted \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{A},\\\\mathbf{B} \\\\rangle_\\\\mathrm{F}. The operation is a component-wise inner product of two matrices as though they are vectors. The two matrices must have the same dimension--same number of rows and columns--but are not restricted to be square matrices. Definition Given two complex number- valued n√óm matrices A and B, written explicitly as : \\\\mathbf {A} ={\\\\begin{pmatrix}A_{11}&A;_{12}&\\\\cdots &A;_{1m}\\\\A_{21}&A;_{22}&\\\\cdots &A;_{2m}\\\\vdots &\\\\vdots &\\\\ddots &\\\\vdots \\\\A_{n1}&A;_{n2}&\\\\cdots &A;_{nm}\\\\end{pmatrix}} \\\\,, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf {B} ={\\\\begin{pmatrix}B_{11}&B;_{12}&\\\\cdots &B;_{1m}\\\\B_{21}&B;_{22}&\\\\cdots &B;_{2m}\\\\vdots &\\\\vdots &\\\\ddots &\\\\vdots \\\\B_{n1}&B;_{n2}&\\\\cdots &B;_{nm}\\\\end{pmatrix}} the Frobenius inner product is defined by the following summation Œ£ of matrix elements, : \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{A}, \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\rangle_\\\\mathrm{F} =\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\overline{A_{ij}} B_{ij} \\\\, = \\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\left(\\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{A}^T} \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right) \\\\equiv \\\\mathrm{Tr}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A}^{!\\\\dagger} \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right) where the overline denotes the complex conjugate, and \\\\dagger denotes Hermitian conjugate.

A year later the association submitted its first major contribution to House of Commons Health Select Committee report: \\"Use of new Medical Technologies within the NHS\\". In 2007, ABHI co-founded the Ministerial Medical Technology Strategy Group, as a HITF recommendation to embed strategic dialogue with government and the following year published its Code of Business Practice, creating mandatory high standards for ethical compliance and professional business conduct in the industry. In 2013 the Code was opened up to non-members. In 2017 the association produced its fourth election manifesto which highlighted a set of key government asks to ensure a thriving medical technology sector.

However, the Arabic loan-word lughaz is also used.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 20, 24, 26. Traditional Persian rhetorical manuals almost always handle riddles, but Persian riddles have enjoyed little modern scholarly attention.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 14-18, 23-29. Yet in the assessment of A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, 'Persian literary riddles provide us with some of the most novel and intricate metaphors and images in Persian poetry'.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), p. 64. Genres and their histories Persian riddles occur in several different literary forms, and it is helpful to trace the history of the Persian riddle through these forms. It is assumed that folk-riddles circulated in Persian from early times, and riddles are prominent in Persian romances set in earlier, pre-Islamic times, perhaps indicating the earlier popularity of the form.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 12, 29-32. Erotic allusions are common in medieval Persian riddles, as in other kinds of metaphorical description.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 49-53. Medieval period It is unclear how medieval Persian riddles were actually performed. Whereas the genre of conundrum known as mu‚ÄòammƒÅ circulated in manuscripts without solutions, riddles were provided with their solutions in medieval and later manuscripts, so it is possible that poets would announce the solution before performing the riddle.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 46-47. =Literary, descriptive riddles= These riddles overlap with and blur into the literary genre of wasf (detailed, metaphorical description), usually appearing in the opening section (nasƒ´b) of a qasƒ´dah. It seems clear that the literary riddle emerged from wasf.Z. Mo‚Äôtaman, ≈†e‚Äòrva adab-e fÔøΩarsi (Tehran 1346/1967‚Äì1968 [1st edn 1322/1943‚Äì1944]), pp. 333‚Äì37 (esp. p. 334), cited by Paola Orsatti, 'The Persian Literary Riddle: Marginal Notes and Critical Remarks on a Recent Study', Middle Eastern Literatures, Incorporating Edebiyat, 15 (2012), 75-85, (p. 79). This genre includes the earliest attested Persian riddles, from around the ninth to eleventh centuries. Some examples may not originally have been riddles, but rather metaphorical descriptions that, in transmission, became divorced from their original contexts, coming to seem like riddles in the process. One example is this anonymous one, cited by Shams-i Qeys in his KitƒÅb al-mu‚Äòjam: What is it that tears into small pieces whatever falls in its toothless mouth? If you put your fingers in its eyes it will instantly prick up its ears.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 31-32. The answer is 'scissors'. As the hugely popular descriptive literature in the khorƒÅsƒÅnƒ´ style became increasingly metaphorical, so too it necessarily became more riddle-like, and by the eleventh century an 'almost codified form of riddle' can be identified, though the boundary between riddle and description is very hard to draw: texts which are unambiguously to be categorised as riddles are not numerous and the process whereby the riddle emerged as a literary form is not altogether clear.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 20, 47-48. However, key exponents of the descriptive riddle form were the innovative poet Mas‚Äò≈´d SƒÅ‚Äòd SalmƒÅn (d. 1121), who composed at least twelve riddles or riddle- like descriptions, his successors ‚ÄòUthmƒÅn MukhtƒÅrƒ´ (d. 1118√ó21) and ·∏§akƒ´m SanƒÅ‚Äôƒ´ (d. 1131√ó41), and Amƒ´r Mu‚Äòizzƒ´ (d. 1125), whose divan includes fourteen riddles.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 85-133. An example is the following riddle by Amƒ´r Mu‚Äòizzƒ´, which involves a series of puns on the different meanings of the word tir ('rank, importance; Mercury, associated with scribes and scholars; arrow'): What is that body that has received tir [importance] from the tir of the sky [Mercury]? :It has the form of a tir [arrow]; it has set the empire as straight as a tir [arrow]. When it weeps, the soul will smile in the body; :When it cries out, the tir [Mercury] will exult in the sky. When it sheds tears, it displays precious jewels, :Through its sound, it brings reports of struggles of the mind. Whatever nature can conceive, it collates :And comments on whatever the imagination generates.Adapted from A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 117-18, with reference to Paola Orsatti, 'The Persian Literary Riddle: Marginal Notes and Critical Remarks on a Recent Study', Middle Eastern Literatures, Incorporating Edebiyat, 15 (2012), 75-85, (p. 84). Later literary riddles tend to be very obscure in style,A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 20-69 (esp. 24-27). even to the point of being unsolvable today.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 65-66. =Wisdom- contests in epic romance= Several Persian romances include some kind of test of verbal wisdom. The earliest is ‚ÄòUn·π£urƒ´'s eleventh-century VƒÅmiq u ‚ÄòAdhrƒÅ,A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 27-28. but the one most clearly conforming to the riddle genre occurs in the renowned ShƒÅh NƒÅma, when Manuchehr asks six Zoroastrian priests to test the wits of ZƒÅl in his suit for R≈´dƒÅba.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 72-84. These are less obscure than the descriptive riddles, tending to feature metaphors and tropes which anyone familiar with Persian poetic conventions could be expected to recognise. For example, in the ShƒÅh NƒÅma (taking just one variant of a text that varies dramatically from one manuscript to another), Another priest said: 'O proud warrior: there are two noble and fleet horses One of them is like a black sea, the other glistens like white crystal. They are both exerting themselves, racing in haste But neither can catch the other. ZƒÅl answers this riddle as follows: The two running horses, black and white that cannot catch each other in the race: Know, O puzzler, that they are night and day, in order that you may feel puzzlement.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), p. 78. =Ethico-philosophical riddles= A very specific type of riddle appears in the twelfth century, in ethico- philosophical epics, in a form probably invented by ‚ÄòUthmƒÅn MukhtƒÅrƒ´, who used it in his Hunar-nƒÅma: the riddle comprises ten couplets posing ethical questions, followed by two couplets in which the poet delivers his answers.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 28-29. One example is the following riddle (Hunar-nƒÅma couplets 343-52): He said: 'What then is that yielding twig, :the cloud of prosperity and the sun of liberality, The face of generosity and the body of magnanimity, :the essence of pleasure and the substance of gaiety, The title of confirmation and the letter of conferral, :the source of sustenance and the Fountain of Life, The source of generosity and the origin of reward, :the ocean of excellence and the mine of bounty, The ornament and beauty of the seal and the dagger, :the dwelling and haven of victory and conquest. It is disdain for gold and scorn for coins, :it is the boast of the reins and honours the pen. Were the cloud to adopt its habits, :it would shelter all men, indiscriminately. If the sun left its traces as this thing does, :mountains would turn into jewels and deserts to gold. Its movements are the vanguards of reward, :its forehead gives light to bounty's eyes. In the time of struggle, it is stronger than the ocean, :in the hour of giving, more generous than heaven.' The narrator provides the following solution: I said: 'This is the hand of the free-giving king, :Lord of the world and the kingdom's master. So long as water, earth, fire and wind exist, :may his grip on the world be absolute.'A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), pp. 172-73. =Occasional riddles= Medieval Persian literature also attests to numerous qit‚Äòas (quatrains) posing varied, often occasional, tests of wit.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), p. 29. =Mu‚ÄòammƒÅ= Persian also adopted the conundrum form mu‚ÄòammƒÅ from Arabic. These conundra are in verse, do not include an interrogatory element, and involve clues as to the letters or sounds of the word. The main study is by Shama Anwari-Alhosseyni.Loqaz und Mo‚ÄòammƒÅ: ein Quellenstudie zur Kunstform der persischen R√§tsels (Berlin, 1986). Folk riddles Although folk riddles are not attested until relatively recently, it is assumed that they existed from ancient times onwards, predating and informing the medieval literary riddle tradition.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), p. 12.

Biography  Born in 1899 in Zhejiang, he enrolled into the Zhejiang First Provincial Normal School in 1917. Following the May Fourth Movement in 1919, he participated in the founding of the magazine \\"Zhejiang New Trends\\", and received recognition for his essay \\"Non-filial\\" that was published in its 2nd issue regarding the closed family culture of Chinese society. He traveled to Beijing in 1920 to pursuit his anti-government agenda but returned to Shanghai after a few months. When he returned, he met up with the editor of \\"New Youth\\" Chen Duxiu upon the liaison from Yu Xiusong, taking up the Marxist ideology and joining the Communist Party of China as one of her founding members. In August 1920, he participated in the founding of the Chinese Communist Youth League, and established the Tokyo Marxist Study Group whilst he was away in Japan for further studies. However, he was expelled in 1922 and he came back to attend the 2nd National Congress. In the same year, he was elected as the First Secretary of the Chinese Communist Youth League. In January 1924, he left the Central Committee to become the CPC's Chairman for the Shanghai Region, and taught at Shanghai University, Zhongshan University, Whompoa Military Academy and Guangzhou Peasant Movement Institute. At the beginning of 1927 he was the policitcal director at the Central Military and Political School of Wuhan. Following the Shanghai massacre of 1927 and the KMT-CPC split, Shi left the Communist Party. The systematic killing of communist leaders and the breakdown of the communist movement in Shanghai were precipitating factors that made Shi denounce his party membership. He became a professor at Guangxi University and Shanghai University. After 1929, he was involved in translating Marxist works, revolutionary and economic theories and during the Second Sino-Japanese War, he was one of the few people who advocated for the protection of Chinese culture. At the end of 1945 he joined Huang Yanpei and Zhang Naiqi in launching the China Democratic National Construction Association (Democratic National Construction Association). At one point he was elected to the Central Committee and vice chairmanship of the Democratic National Construction Association. In 1949, he attended the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) as a representative of the People's Political Consultative Conference, and was elected as a Standing Committee Member and Deputy Secretary-General of the First CPPCC.

It is a dense, bushy shrub with leaves composed of three leaflets which are warty on the upper surface. In winter and early spring it has groups of five to eight flowers, each with four white petals, the groups usually shorter than the leaves. Description Zieria adenodonta is a dense, bushy shrub which grows to a height of and has warty branchlets. The leaves are composed of three leaflets with the central one, long and wide with a stalk long. The leaflets are dark green and warty on the upper surface, light green and not wary on the lower side. The edges of the leaflets are slightly rolled under and have small teeth. They have an unpleasant smell when crushed. The flowers are white and are arranged in upper leaf axils, usually in groups of five to eight, but sometimes as many as 27. The groups are usually shorter than the leaves. There are four more or less hairy, triangular sepal lobes less than long. The four petals are about long and slightly hairy. In common with other zierias, there are only four stamens. Flowering occurs from May to September and is followed by the fruit which is a yellow-brown, egg-shaped capsule containing one black seed.Z. adenodonta in the Australian National Botanic Gardens Taxonomy and naming Wollumbin zieria was first formally described in 1875 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Zieria granulata var. adenodonta and published the description in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. In 2002, James Armstrong raised it to species status and published the change in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (adenodonta) is derived from the Ancient Greek words aden meaning \\"gland\\" and odous meaning \\"tooth\\".

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from the marshlands or fields of Iraq. It has short, linear or sickle shaped grey-green leaves, slender stem, a single flower in spring, which has a dingy-white, whitish, or pale background, which is covered in many spots or dark veining, in black-purple, brown-purple, or brown violet, or brown shades. It has a dark brown or burgundy brown signal patch and white tinged with yellow or orange white sparse beard. It is rarely cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, as it needs very dry conditions during the summer. Description It has a short, brown rhizome, that is creeping and stoloniferous. It has 5-7 leaves,British Iris Society (1997) which are linear in the middle, but falcate or sickle-shaped, on the outside.Richard Lynch They are similar in form to Iris sari but are narrower.John Weathers The glaucescent, greyish green leaves, can grow up to between long, and between 0.8mm and 1.2 cm wide. After flowering they begin to fade away, before regrowing in spring. It has a slender stem or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall. The flowers are high above the foliage. The stem has 1 green, lanceolate, membranous, spathes (leaf of the flower bud), which is long. The stem has a terminal (top of stem) flower, blooming in Spring between April, and June. The flowers are in diameter, they have a dingy-white, whitish, or pale background, which has many spots and dark veining, in black-purple, brown-purple, or brown violet, or brown shades. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The obovate or cuneate (wedge shaped) falls, are long and 3.5‚Äì4 cm wide. In the centre of the fall, is a signal patch, which is dark brown, or burgundy brown, and in the middle of the falls, it has a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which is sparse, and white with a slightly yellow tint, or orange-white. It has broader standards, which are orbicular (rounded), or unguiculate (narrow stalk-like), they are cm long and 4.5‚Äì5 cm wide. It has short, 3.5 to 5 cm long, broad and crenulated crests, and a 2.5 cm long perianth tube. After the iris has flowered, it produces a trigonal (narrow at both ends) and long seed capsule. Biochemistry As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. It has a chromosome count: 2n=20, similar to other Oncocyclus irises. Taxonomy The Latin specific epithet heylandiana refers to the German botanical artist Jean- Christophe Heyland (1791-1866), he lived mainly in Switzerland, working for Delessert, Webb, Boissier and other botanists. It was originally found in Mesopotamia, and then called Iris iberica var. heylandiana by John Gilbert Baker in 1877 in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society (J. Linn. Soc., Bot.) Vol.16 on page 142. It was then soon re-named as Iris heylandiana in 1882 by Boiss. in Fl. Orient. Vol.5 on page 130, (edited by Reut.). In 1893, Foster described the species in The Garden (journal) of 18 February, but in 1977 S. A Chaudhary worked out that one of these was instead Iris gatesii. It was found that Boissier & Reuter had named two specimens Iris heylandiana, but one of these was also determined to be I. gatesii by Chaudhary. It has also been confused with Iris nectarifera, as both of these species have been found in the Derbassieh area in Syria. Although I. nectarifera is mainly from adjacent Turkey. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then altered on 2 December 2004. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life, and in the Catalogue of Life. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate Asia. Range It is found in Iraq, from Mosul to Baghdad. It is also once thought to occur in north-east Syria, and found in Palestine in 1888.Henry C. Stewardson (Editor) Palestine Exploration Fund Iris maculata (a synonym for the iris) was found in Turkey, near Mardin. Habitat It grows on drained marshlands, and fields. Conservation It was listed as Endangered in 1991. Cultivation In general, 'Oncocyclus Section' Irises need good drainage, minimal summer rainfall and dry winters. In temperate areas (such as the Europe and America), they are only suitable for growing by specialist iris growers, within a bulb frame or greenhouse. They can be grown under glass (in frames), to protect the irises from excess moisture (especially during winter times) and also to ensure the (shallow planted) rhizomes get the best temperatures during the growing season. They can be grown in pots (especially in deep ones known as 'long toms'), but they need re-potting, every 2 years and extra feeding. Watering is one of the most critical aspects of iris cultivation. It can suffer from aphids, viruses and rots. A herbarium specimen can be found in Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Propagation Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. Irises generally require a period of cold, then a period of warmth and heat, also they need some moisture. Some seeds need stratification, (the cold treatment), which can be carried out indoors or outdoors. Seedlings are generally potted on (or transplanted) when they have 3 leaves. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also handling the plant may cause a skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske ReferencesOther sources * Mathew, B. The Iris. 1981 (Iris) 51-52. * Rechinger, K.

Life Muhammad ibn al-Zayyat belonged to a wealthy family of merchants. The family was probably Persian. His father, Abd al-Malik, had made a fortune as an oil trader (whence his sobriquet al-ZayyƒÅt) in Baghdad at the time of al-Ma'mun (r. 813‚Äì833), and became involved in the lucrative government contracts for tents, ceremonial parasols (al-mushammas), and riding equipment. Muhammad succeeded his father in these activities. By the end of al-Mamun's reign, Ibn al-Zayyat had become secretary in the caliphal chancellery. Career under al-Mu'tasim and al-Wathiq According to al-Tabari, al-Mu'tasim's first vizier, al-Fadl ibn Marwan, upbraided Ibn al-Zayyat for daring to appear at court in ceremonial garb, with the black Abbasid robes (durrƒÅ øah) and girt sword, although he was \\"only a trader\\". Al- Fadl also tried to have Dulayl ibn Ya'qub al-Nasrani examine Ibn al-Zayyat's financial activities for irregularities, but Dulayl was lenient and did not confiscate anything from Ibn al-Zayyat. In 836, however, al-Mu'tasim dismissed al-Fadl, and appointed Ibn al-Zayyat in his place. He would continue to hold the vizierate for the remainder of al-Mu'tasim's reign, as well as the reign of al-Wathiq (r. 842‚Äì847), and into the reign of al-Mutawakkil (r. 847‚Äì861), who had him executed. As vizier, Ibn al-Zayyat became one of the leading men of the state, and the chief civilian minister alongside the head qƒÅdƒ´, Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad, with whom he entertained a fierce personal rivalry. He was responsible for much of the construction work on al-Mu'tasim's new capital, Samarra. In 840 he was the chief prosecutor in the show trial against al- Afshin, prince of Ushrusana and until then one of the leading military commanders of the regime; al-Afshin was accused, among other things, of being a false Muslim, and of being accorded divine status by his subjects in his native Ushrusana. Despite putting up an able and eloquent defence, al-Afshin was found guilty and thrown into prison. He died soon after, either of starvation or of poison; his body was publicly gibbeted in front of the palace gates, burned, and thrown in the Tigris. When al-Mu'tasim died in January 842, the throne passed to his son, al-Wathiq. Real power however lay with al- Mu'tasim's coterie of leading officials, Ibn al-Zayyat, Ibn Abi Duwad, and the Turkish generals Ashinas, Itakh, and Wasif. In 843/4, he is said by some sources to have been responsible for the heavy fines imposed by the Caliph on several of the secretaries in the central government, in an effort to raise money to pay the Turkish troops, and at the same time reduce the power of the leading Turkish commanders, such as Itakh and Ashinas, since most of the secretaries arrested and forced to pay were in their service. In the process, Ibn al-Zayyat became notorious for the severity and cruelty with which he treated the prisoners, torturing them with a device of his own invention, the tannur (\\"oven\\"), a kind of iron maiden. In 845, he received a Byzantine embassy, with whom he negotiated about a prisoner exchange, which was held in September of the same year under the auspices of Khaqan al-Khadim. Ibn al- Zayyat was also an ardent patron of learning and science, and promoted the translation movement of Greek authors then under way; thus he commissioned Ishaq ibn Hunayn to translate works of Galen. Like al-Ma'mun, he was rumoured to be a zindƒ´q, which normally meant \\"Manichaean\\", but was also used a shorthand by orthodox Sunni writers to denounce those with heterodox (pro- Shi'ite) beliefs. During his ascendancy, he was also the main patron of the theologian al-Jahiz. Accession of al-Mutawakkil, downfall and death When al-Wathiq died unexpectedly in August 847, Ibn al-Zayyat, Ibn Abi Duwad, Wasif, Itakh, and a few other leading officials assembled to determine his successor. Ibn al-Zayyat initially proposed al-Wathiq's son Muhammad (the future al-Muhtadi), but due to his youth he was passed over, and instead the council chose another of al-Mu'tasim's sons, the 26-year-old Ja'far, who became the caliph al-Mutawakkil. Unbeknownst to Ibn al-Zayyat and the others, the new Caliph was resolved to destroy the coterie of his father's officials that controlled the state, and furthermore harboured a deep grudge against the vizier for the way he had been mistreated by him in the past. According to al- Tabari, when al-Wathiq had grown angry and suspicious at his brother, al- Mutawakkil had visited the vizier in hopes of persuading him to intercede with the Caliph. Not only had Ibn al-Zayyat kept the Abbasid prince waiting until he finished going through his correspondence, but even mocked him, in the presence of others, for coming to him seeking assistance. Not only that, but when the dejected prince left, Ibn al-Zayyat wrote to the Caliph to complain about his appearance, noting that he was dressed in effeminate fashion, and that his hair was too long. As a result, al-Wathiq had his brother summoned to court. Al-Mutawakkil came in a brand-new court dress, hoping to mollify the Caliph, but instead al-Wathiq ordered that his hair be shorn off, and al- Mutawakkil be struck in the face with it. In later times, al-Mutawakkil confessed that he had never been so distressed by anything in his life than by this public humiliation. Thus, on 22 September 847, he sent Itakh to summon Ibn al-Zayyat as if for an audience. Instead, the vizier was brought to Itakh's residence, where his ceremonial garb‚ÄîdurrƒÅ øah, sword, belt, and cap‚Äîwere removed and he was placed under arrest. His servants were sent home on the pretext that the vizier would stay to drink wine with Itakh, but soon Itakh sent his own servants to the vizier's residence to confiscate his possessions; Itakh's men were reportedly impressed by how poor his furniture and lodgings were. Ibn al-Zayyat appointed al-Abbas ibn Ahmad ibn Rashid, the secretary of Ujayf ibn Anbasah, as his agent to supervise the sale of his estates. After a few days, he was put in fetters and tortured by being kept from sleeping, while another story‚Äîfrequently retold by later authors as a morality tale‚Äîclaimed that he was placed inside the tannur, the same device that he had devised. He died after a few days, and was buried unceremoniously, with his own sons denouncing him as a criminal to save themselves. Itakh himself was arrested and executed in 849, while Ibn Abi Duwad lasted until 851, when he and his son were dismissed, and their estates confiscated. These events marked the end of al-Mu'tasim's \\"old guard\\", and the full assumption of power by al-Mutawakkil, who reoriented Abbasid policy towards a traditionalist, orthodox Sunni position. The historian of the Abbasid vizierate, Dominique Sourdel, summed up Ibn al-Zayyat's vizierate as \\"he had tried in vain to restrain the influence of the Turkish leaders, and left behind mainly a reputation for harshness and cruelty\\".

The SDF's subsidiary goals included capturing the Tabqa Dam, the nearby city of al- Thawrah, and the Baath Dam further downstream. The campaign ended successfully in October 2017, with the capture of Raqqa. The offensive was concurrent with the Battle of Sirte in Libya, the Battle of Mosul in Iraq, the Battle of al- Bab in the Aleppo Governorate, the Palmyra offensive, the reignition of fighting in Deir ez-Zor's siege, the Central Syria campaign, and the Mayadin offensive.  Background  In late October 2016, the United States Secretary of Defense Ash Carter called for an offensive on Raqqa to take place concurrent with the Battle of Mosul in Iraq. He stated that the US was cooperating with its allies in order to launch an \\"isolation operation\\" around Raqqa. On 26 October, the President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan called the President of the United States Barack Obama and stated that he did not want the People's Protection Units (YPG) to participate in the planned operation, and instead, planned to involve the Turkish Armed Forces. The United Kingdom's Secretary of State for Defence Michael Fallon rejected the idea of non-Arab forces taking part in the offensive and demanded a purely Arab force. On the same day, the commander of the Combined Joint Task Force ‚Äì Operation Inherent Resolve Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend stressed that the YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces was the only armed group capable of capturing Raqqa in the near future. Fewer US-led coalition troops were to be involved than in the Battle of Mosul. On 3 November, the commander of the Seljuk Brigade and SDF spokesman Col. Talal Silo rejected the participation of Turkey in the operation. After the start of the Battle of Mosul, many of the 20,000 ISIL fighters estimated to be living in Mosul fled to Raqqa, boosting the ISIL forces that were already present in their de facto capital city.  Announcement  The SDF officially announced the start of the operation on 6 November 2016, in the city of Ayn Issa. The intention was to proceed in two phases, first seizing areas around Raqqa and isolating the city, advancing from three fronts, then taking control of the city itself. The SDF general command called for the international coalition against ISIL to support the operation. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter welcomed the announcement.  The offensive = Phase One: Isolating Raqqa from its northern hinterland  ISIL headquarters in the northern Raqqa countryside, after being captured by the SDF On 6 November, the SDF captured six small villages, including the villages of Wahid, Umm Safa, Wasita, Haran, al-Adriyah and Jurah south and southeast of Ayn Issa. The Islamic State detonated four car bombs on the first day of the offensive. On 8 November, the SDF reported that they had taken control of 11 villages near Ayn Issa. The SDF also claimed that ISIL used several car bombs against their forces. By 11 November, the SDF had captured over a dozen villages and the strategically significant town of Al-Hisbah, which had served as a local headquarters and command center for ISIL. On the next day, the SDF continued to advance against ISIL in the area around Tal Saman and Khnez, bringing the number of captured farms and villages to 26. On 14 November, the SDF reported the completion of the First Phase of the operations, stating that 500 km2 has been captured: 34 villages, 31 hamlets and seven strategic hills, along with 167 Islamic State casualties. The SDF had also begun to besiege Tal Saman, the largest village and ISIL headquarters north of Raqqa, while ISIL launched a counter-attack near Salok in the eastern countryside of Raqqa Governorate in order to force the SDF to split its forces and open a new front. On the next day, the SDF advanced into Tal Saman, resulting in a fierce battle with its ISIL defenders, and captured 10 more villages and farms. By 19 November, the SDF had fully captured Tal Saman and had driven ISIL completely from the surrounding countryside. With this, the first phase of the offensive was considered completed.  Stalemate and preparation for the second phase  A United States Air Force airstrike on an ISIL position to the north of Raqqa The second phase of the offensive aimed to enforce a full blockade of the city of Raqqa. On 21 November, the SDF captured two more villages, while ISIL launched a counter-attack near Tal Saman. Over the next days, the SDF attempted to further advance, such as at al-Qalita, but was unable to break through ISIL's defense line south of Tal Saman. On 24 November, a US serviceman died from wounds he suffered after stepping on an improvised explosive device near the town of Ayn Issa, to the north of Raqqa. On 25 November, ISIL received reinforcements from Iraq, among them explosive experts and defected Iraqi Army personnel. On the next day, ISIL launched a counter-attack, retaking parts of Qaltah village and a nearby water pump station, while the SDF managed to advance in the village's vicinity. Boubaker Al-Hakim, an ISIL commander who was linked to the Charlie Hebdo shooting, was reported to have been killed in an American airstrike in Raqqa on 26 November. Iraqi military however later stated in April 2017 that he might still be alive. On 27 November, the SDF announced the offensive's second phase was due to start, though this was then delayed. At least five SDF fighters were killed in renewed clashes north of Raqqa on 29 November. Meanwhile, ISIL suffered from the defection of two senior commanders, who fled from Raqqa to join Jabhat Fateh al-Sham in Idlib. On 4 December, a coalition drone strike in Raqqa killed two ISIL leaders who had helped facilitate the November 2015 Paris attacks and another who was involved in a foiled suicide attack in Belgium in 2015. Three days later, co-Chair of the Democratic Union Party (PYD) Salih Muslim said that the first phase to surround Raqqa was almost over, while a new Arab brigade consisting of more than 1,000 men and women from the Raqqa area had joined the SDF as part of the second phase which was slated to be launched on 10 December. More than 1,500 Arab fighters who were trained and equipped by the anti-ISIL coalition joined the SDF for the second phase on its launch day.  Phase Two: Isolating Raqqa from its western countryside  Initial advances = SDF fighters advance northwest of Raqqa after the start of the offensive's second phase. The SDF launched the second phase on 10 December, with the aim of capturing the northwestern and western countryside of Raqqa and ultimately reaching and securing the Tabqa Dam. The same day, it was announced that Arab SDF groups, consisting of the Elite Forces, Jabhat Thuwar al-Raqqa and the newly formed Deir Ezzor Military Council would be taking part. During the first day, the SDF began to advance south of the Tishrin Dam and captured al-Kiradi village. The United States announced that it would send 200 more troops to assist the SDF. The next day, the SDF captured seven more villages from ISIL. On 12 December, the SDF captured four villages as well as many hamlets south of Tishrin Dam. The SDF captured five villages during the next two days. On 15 December, the SDF captured three villages, taking the total number of villages captured by them in the second phase to 20. Over the next four days, the SDF captured 20 more villages and finally reaching Lake Assad, thereby cutting off and besieging 54 ISIL-held villages to the west. In response to these territorial losses, ISIL began to carry out more suicide attacks against both the SDF as well as civilian targets within SDF-controlled areas in an attempt to hinder the offensive. On 19 December, ISIL launched a counter-attack to regain four villages in the northwestern countryside, but the attack was repelled after a few hours. The SDF declared that they had captured 97 villages overall during the second phase, and had begun to advance against Qal'at Ja'bar. = Battle of Jabar = Dead ISIL fighters near Mahmudli On 21 December, the SDF seized Jabar,SDF controlled Ja‚Äôbar historic castle and continues progress toward Raqqa which served as the main weaponry storage and supply centre for ISIL in the northwestern countryside. The coalition then began to move toward Suwaydiya Saghirah and Suwaydiya Kabir, the last villages before Tabqa Dam. Even though an ISIL counter-attack managed to retake Jabar village soon after, the SDF attacked again on 23 December, and once again took control of it, while also capturing another village. This prompted ISIL to launch yet another counter-attack later that day, which was accompanied by several suicide car bombs. As a result, heavy clashes took place between them and SDF fighters in several villages along the frontline that lasted until the early morning of 24 December. The ISIL forces were eventually forced to withdraw after the SDF first shelled and then stormed their positions, whereupon the latter took control of most of Jabar as well as two more villages, though some ISIL holdouts persisted in Jabar. ISIL was pushed out of the neighboring, strategic village of Eastern Jabar on the next day, bringing the SDF within of Tabqa Dam, and by 26 December, the SDF had finally fully secured the main Jabar village, with the last ISIL defenders being expelled after heavy fighting. An ISIL counterattack on the village later that day failed, with a US airstrike killing Abu Jandal al-Kuwaiti as he commanded the assault. Al-Kuwaiti, also known as Abdulmuhsin al-Zaghelan al-Tarish, was a high-ranking ISIL commander leading the defense of the whole Raqqa region against the SDF. Meanwhile, the Amaq News Agency declared that Iman Na'im Tandil (nom de guerre: Abu 'Umar Al- Hindi), one of the few Indian ISIL fighters active in Syria, had also been killed during the fighting near Jabar. The Islamic State's official media wing later also officially paid tribute to Iman. = Battle for Jabar's surroundings = YPG BMP, loaded on a truck, being transported to the frontline near Mahmudli on 4 January  First week  On 27 December, ISIL launched an attack on the village of Secol in the northern countryside, reportedly breaching the local SDF defences. On the next day, the SDF reportedly captured Hadaj village after two days of heavy fighting, while another ISIL counter-attack against Jabar was repelled. Mahmud al-Isawi, a senior ISIL manager of finances for the group's leaders who also worked in propaganda and intelligence-gathering, was killed on 31 December in a US-led coalition airstrike on Raqqa. After three days of heavy fighting, the SDF captured all or most of Mahmudli, the largest town of the Al-Jarniyah Subdistrict, on 1 January 2017. ISIL counterattacked later in an attempt to regain the town. The SDF leadership said that in the clashes since the launch of the second phase they had captured 110 villages, killed 277 ISIL fighters, and captured 13.

On 8 January 2017, US special forces raided the village of Al-Kubar, between Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor, killing at least 25 ISIL militants in the two-hour operation. It was believed that the goal of the US may have been to rescue hostages from an ISIL secret prison in the village. After the raid, ISIL forces cut off access to the village. On 9 January, the SDF captured another village, along with three hamlets.  Third week  On 10 January, ISIL launched a large-scale counter-attack at the Jabar frontline and reportedly recaptured several sites; with pro-Free Syrian Army sources claiming Qal'at Ja'bar and the village of Jabar were among these. ISIL consequently released photos of dead SDF fighters, while claiming that over 70 of them had been killed in the counter-attack. However, the SDF was reported to still be in control of Jabar village and Qalat Jabar a few days later.

On 23 January, the SDF began to advance on the Tabqa Dam, spurring ISIL to open its turbines to raise the Euphrates River's water levels. This was seen as an attempt to hinder the progress of the Kurdish-led forces and a scare tactic, and caused the water level of the Euphrates to rise to its highest level in 20 years, leading to record flooding downstream. By 24 January, the SDF managed to capture parts of the town, and they began to work towards the Tabqa Dam's control rooms, at the southern part of the dam, in an attempt to stop the massive outflow of water released by ISIL. However, the entrance to the dam's control rooms was too well defended, and with the continued threat of disastrous flooding downstream, SDF and the US forces withdrew from both the Tabqa Dam and the town of Al-Thawrah, after which ISIL closed the dam's turbines again. Over the next three days, ISIL repeatedly launched fierce counter-attacks against SDF positions in the western and northern countryside. ISIL managed to retake ground in the area around the dam, but the attack was later repelled.

The SDF made further progress, capturing three more villages on 7 February. In early February 2017, US-led coalition airstrikes destroyed much of the Deir ez-Zor- Raqqa highway, reducing it to a single-file gravel road in some spots, with the SDF patrolling other areas with minefields, in order to prevent ISIL from reinforcing Raqqa city. By this point, almost all of the five bridges leading to Raqqa had been destroyed either by the US-led coalition or by ISIL, with the only exceptions being the Tabqa Dam and the Baath Dam, both west of Raqqa city. As these advances continued, ISIL responded by launching several unsuccessful counter-attacks against Suwaydiya Kabir and other strategic territories captured by the SDF. On 8 and 9 February, the SDF advanced at the northern and northeastern frontline, capturing several villages and besieging Mizella, a major strategic ISIL stronghold in the northern countryside. The advance put them within of Raqqa. The SDF captured Mizella the next day.

On 26 February, a US airstrike near Tabqa Dam destroyed a former government facility which was being used as a headquarters by ISIL. The airstrike's proximity to the dam's structure led to fears that the dam could potentially be destabilized or destroyed during the fighting. Later that day, it was reported that the SDF had captured the village of Al-Kubar, on the northern bank of the Euphrates in the Deir ez-Zor countryside, further tightening the siege on Raqqa. On 28 February, it was reported that the US-led coalition had completely destroyed the Tabqa Airbase in an airstrike.

The next day, the SDF announced the \\"final phase\\" of the battle, code-named the Battle of Martyr Adnan Abu Amjad, to capture the remaining ISIL holdouts in 10% of the city. On 16 October, the SDF reportedly destroyed the last ISIL forces in the al-Andalus and al-Matar neighborhoods, and finally secured the al-Naim roundabout. On 17 October, ISIL control in Raqqa officially ended when the SDF captured the National Hospital and the Stadium, though a clear and hold operation was still expected in order to clear out potential remaining pockets of resistance. Following the end of clearing operations, victory was officially declared by the SDF on 20 October.  Syrian Army offensive in southern Raqqa  On June 12, the Syrian Arab Army (SAA), led by the Tiger Forces, began an offensive on ISIL positions in the western countryside of Raqqa, south of the town of Maskanah, which it recently captured, toward the Ithriya-Tabqa highway, aiming to secure its main supply route to Aleppo. A Hezbollah-run media unit reported that government forces advanced 32 km south of Maskanah, capturing the villages of Rajm Askar, Bir Inbaj, Zahar Um Baj, Jab Aziz, Jab al-Ghanem, Abu Sousa and Jab Abyadin in the process. A source close to the Tiger Forces said that the SAA had occupied all areas west of the Resafa oil field. Al-Masdar News reported that the June 13 advances marked the first time government forces had any presence around SDF-occupied Tabqa in three years. On 18 June, a Syrian Air Force Su-22 was shot down by a US Navy F-18E south of Tabqa; the US military subsequently claimed that the Syrian jet had been intercepted after it had bombed SDF positions. Both the pro- opposition SOHR as well as the pro-SDF Hawar News Agency denied this, however, stating that the jet had not attacked the SDF. The Syrian government said that their Su-22 had bombed ISIL positions when it was destroyed. On July 15, the SAA captured the Wahab, al-Fahd, Dbaysan, al-Qseer, Abu al-Qatat and Abu Qatash oil fields, south of Resafa. Al-Masdar News reported that the Tiger Forces overran three more fields in the region the following day, including Zamleh Sharqiyah, Bir Zamleh and Al-Khalaa.  Administration of captured territory = Civil administration  Samer Kharkhi, one of the Raqqa Civil Council's leading members Members of the Raqqa Internal Security Forces with their flag in Ayn Issa On 14 November, the SDF's civilian sister institution, the Syrian Democratic Council (SDC), started working on the establishment of a civilian administration to run the city of Raqqa after the expulsion of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. SDC co-chair √élham Ehmed said \\"such an administration could provide a good example for democratic change in Raqqa, especially that the city has been for years a de facto capital for the ISIS terrorist group. This accomplishment would be a major change in the overall situation in Syria, and would help the country move towards stability, democratic change. Raqqa will be an example for the whole country.\\" On 8 December, Col. John Dorrian, the Operation Inherent Resolve spokesman, stated that \\"a governance structure representative of the local population\\" similar to that in Manbij is planned for Raqqa. On 10 December, Cihan Shekh Ehmed, the spokesman of the SDF-led operation, said that Raqqa would be run by a local elected civilian council after it was liberated. On 27 March 2017, Salih Muslim Muhammad, co-chairman of the Democratic Union Party (PYD), said that as soon as the SDF had captured the city, \\"the people of Raqqa are the ones who [will] take the decision on everything\\". If they wanted to do so, Muslim said, they could choose to join the Democratic Federal System of Northern Syria. On the same day, the provisional Raqqa Civil Council announced that it had taken over the administration of the eastern countryside. During a meeting in Ayn Issa on 18 April 2017 attended by tribal chiefs and local dignitaries from Raqqa, SDF announced the official establishment of a civilian council to govern Raqqa city after it is captured. During the meeting of delegates including representatives from Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen; co-chairs Layla Mohammed and Mahmoud Shawakh al-Busran were elected and 14 committees were established. SDF stated that a military council to provide security to the city after its capture will be formed soon. On 20 April, the new civilian council also began to operate in the areas of Tabqa, handling the distribution of food to local villagers. On 15 May 2017, an agreement was made to establish a 'Tabqa Civilian Assembly'. This assembly will be temporary as a broader assembly will be established with councils following the return of residents. On 17 May 2017, the Raqqa Internal Security Forces (RISF) were established as new police unit, with the first training course being set up in Ayn Issa; their purpose is to provide law and order in the areas captured from ISIL during the campaign. As native police, the RISF is supposed to be expanded to at least 3,000 members. On 20 October, SDF declared that Raqqa and its province will decide its own future \\"within the framework of a decentralised, federal, democratic Syria\\". They pledged to protect Raqqa province from external threats and hand over control to a civil council from the city. In a ceremony on the same day, SDF handed over administration of Raqqa city to the civil council while the 3,000-strong United States-trained police force was tasked with governance and security.  IDP camp and informal settlement  Food, goods and resources have become rare in Raqqa due to clashes, while lives are also at risk from fightings and coalition's bombings.http://www.reachresourcecentre.info/system/files/resource- documents/reach_syr_ar-raqqa_city_situation_overview_ii_7_july_2017.pdf, from http://www.reachresourcecentre.info/countries/syria Also, a number of IDP camps and settlement have been set up across northern Syria.http://www.reachresourcecentre.info/system/files/resource- documents/reach_syr_raqqa_camps_and_sites_profiles_july_2017_v5.pdf, from http://www.reachresourcecentre.info/countries/syria  Tensions and insurgency  On 25 March 2018, protests erupted in Mansoura after a leader of the Bukahmis tribe was arrested by the SDF. Protesters burned tires, and SDF fighters opened fire. The tribal leader was released on the same day. Following the protests, a SDF YPG intelligence officer was killed and his body was dumped on a road near Mansoura. It is unclear if his assassination was related to the protests. After the conclusion of the campaign, the SDF was faced with a continued insurgency by ISIL.

Hull and Stuart Ballantine. RFL developed technologies, but did not manufacture products. However, when it developed an aviation-radio division, in 1924, the division, ARC, soon outgrew its parent company, with the success of its aviation radios developed and manufactured in Boonton. Helfrick, Albert (former ARC employee), \\"Aircraft Radio Corporation and Their Role in the Development of Avionics\\", presentation, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona Beach, FL Freeman, et al., \\"Aircraft Radio Corporation Airfield, Boonton, NJ,\\", Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields website Independence By 1927, Aircraft Radio Corporation (ARC), was a wholly owned subsidiary of Radio Frequency Laboratories, and was spun off as a separate company, producing navigation and communications radios for military, commercial and general aviation. ARC radios were considered mainstream, basic radios in their market segment, and were widely used. An airport was developed to accommodate the needs of the booming enterprise, on 116 acres near town. Development of Aircraft Radio Receivers, booklet, 1929, Aircraft Radio Corporation, Boonton, NJ In early 1929, an engineering conference at the Flying Field drew many people from the electronic instruments industry to celebrate the new ARC facility's opening and dedication, including a laboratory in Boonton, and a hangar at the Flying Field. First \\"blind\\" flight Pioneer aviator Jimmy Doolittle kept his plane at the ARC hangar, and teamed with ARC to accomplish the world's first \\"blind\\" landing -- landing an airplane solely by reference to instruments, the first milestone in developing today's all-weather instrument flight. ARC developed the radio-beam and onboard radio receiver navigation equipment essential to the flight, the first radio instrument landing system. The system they developed led to the creation of their \\"Model B\\"‚Äîan early radio navigation system for the airlines. Military success A history of U.S. Navy radio research and development describes how little ARC beat out competitors far larger in the electronics world: ::The Bureau of Engineering decided to explore the frequency range 3000 to 4000 kHz for short-range fighter and spotting aircraft communication and sponsored NRL's [Naval Research Laboratory's] effort to provide suitable equipment (1926). The first such procured were the models MD (General Electric) and ME (Westinghouse) (1927-1929). These were followed by the [ARC] GF transmitter (5000 to 8000 kHz), accompanied by the [ARC] Model RU receiver. (1931-1933). The Model GF/RU equipment was the first to provide acceptable two-way, aircraft voice communication, feasible because of the availability of effective ignition-system shielding. The Model GF/RU (Aircraft Radio Corporation) was procured in large numbers and used extensively, and continued in use through World War II.Gebhard, Louis A. \\"Evolution of Naval Radio- Electronics and Contributions of the Naval Research Laboratory,\\" Report #NRL 8300, 1979, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C., retrieved November 6, 2016 (emphasis added) The GF/RU (Army designation SCR-183), a derivative of the civilian Model B, was chosen as America's standard military aircraft radio of the early 1930s. By 1933, ARC-designed radios were being installed in the 1st fighter (aircraft) squadrons of the U.S. Army Air Corps and U.S. Navy. By 1934, the company had its own airfield and airplane (a Berliner parasol monoplane, for experimentation. The ARC-designed BC375 communications radio was soon followed by the AN/ARC-5 communications radio system, which was a leading suite of Allied airborne electronics equipment during World War II.Tauson, M. W., \\"A User's Guide to Aircraft Radio Corporation Receivers,\\" retrieved November 6, 2016 Wartime In the 1940s, ARC radios were everywhere in U.S. military aircraft. Lewis Hull served as ARC President. Postwar The military avionics market evaporated after World War II, and ARC found itself outmaneuvered in commercial airline radios by Bendix Corp. and Collins. The postwar collapse of the light plane industry took their last market, and for the first time, ARC was losing money. The Korean War changed that‚Äîdriving up demand for their military radios, but, again, when the war ended, ARC struggled. The situation was exacerbated by key engineers leaving to start their own enterprises. An engagement with Laurence and David Rockefeller. to work on a secret military radar system, led to the Rockefeller family buying controlling interest in ARC, and their tampering with its independent status. and Litton Industries got involved. Stock values fluctuated, burning some. Cessna acquires ARC In 1959, ARC was acquired by one of its principal customers, Cessna Aircraft Company, the world's highest- volume airplane manufacturer. Cessna, while retaining the name and quasi- independent status of Aircraft Radio Corporation, rebranded the company's products as \\"Cessna avionics,\\" and the enterprise began a notorious decline in product quality, resulting in high prouduct-failure rates and a terrible reputation in the aviation industry\\"Cessna 177 Cardinal,\\" March 31, 2016, Aviation Consumer retrieved April 27, 2017Aarons, Richard N., ed., \\"B/CA Analysis: Cessna 425 Corsair,\\" January 1981, Business & Commercial Aviation, McGraw-Hill, as transcribed at aviationresearch.com, retrieved Nov. 6, 2016Flaum, District Judge, Memorandum Opinion, \\"FONTANA AVIATION, INC., Plaintiff, v.

During the proceedings, the following findings emerged as public record in the published decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit: ::\\"Aircraft Radio Company,* located at Boonton, New Jersey, is the second smallest of seven operating divisions of the Cessna Aircraft Company which has its headquarters at Wichita, Kansas. ARC is engaged in the manufacture, distribution and sale of aviation communication and navigational equipment. It supplies its products to Cessna as well as to other competitive firms. ARC is conducted as an independent business; sales and profits are accounted for separately, and its wage agreements are independently negotiated. In fiscal year 1972, ARC had total sales of $11,000,000 and in 1971, $6,700,000, which resulted in net losses for each of those years. By contrast, Cessna is much larger and more profitable. Its sales for 1972 were $248,000,000 which resulted in profits of $13,500,000.\\" (* Note that the original (1972) title of the case named ARC as \\"Aircraft Radio Corporation -- implying a legally distinct entity, while the appeals court decision (1975), under that original case name, repeatedly refers to ARC in the body of the ruling as \\"Aircraft Radio Company,\\" implying an identity less certainly distinct from its parent company, Cessna‚Äîa fact that changed during the litigation, apparently sometime afer a September, 1973 letter from parent Cessna, of which the Court notes...: :: The company responded with a letter on September 25, 1973, asserting that the sales and profits cited by IUE were those of the Cessna Aircraft Company, Wichita, Kansas, and that ARC was independently responsible for all phases of its own business, including making a profit. On the following day, the company general manager delivered a prepared speech to the employees, explaining the distinction between ARC and Cessna and making available the [(separate)] financial reports of both concerns.) The ARC identity issue, though‚Äîand the timing of ARC's names‚Äîis further confused by this 1978 statement in a judge's memorandum in a lawsuit over Cessna's marketing of its avionics: ::The Cessna Aircraft Company (Cessna), is the largest manufacturer in the United States of general aviation aircraft. Through its Aircraft Radio and Control Division (ARCD), Cessna also manufactures and sells avionics equipment. ::  ::In 1959, Cessna obtained the stock, business, and assets of Aircraft Radio Corporation (ARC), an independent manufacturer of avionics. ARC was operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Cessna until about September 30, 1968, at which time it was dissolved and replaced by ARCD. Other sources, including a Cessna job ad in 1981, also indicate that Cessna, at one time, referred to ARC as \\"Aircraft Radio and Control - Cessna's avionics division.\\" At its peak, ARC employed around 3,500 workers. Among the senior personnel during the Cessna years, Floyd Piper served as chief engineer and chief systems engineer.,\\"Floyd Piper, '43,\\" obituary, Cornell University, retrieved November 6, 2016 and, November, 1981, John Ferrara was Manager of Advanced Development.

Sperry / Unisys / Honeywell acquires ARC In late 1983, Cessna finally unloaded its now-unpopular avionics subsidiary onto rival avionics maker (and industrial conglomerate) Sperry, who, in turn was acquired by Unisys, then Honeywell, Inc.. Sperry decided to relocate ARC to Sperry's Phoenix, Arizona facility, ending 57 years of ARC's avionics development and production in Boonton. The ARC relationship didn't last long.

Early life Magalh√£es was born in Pedr√≥g√£o, Coimbra, Portugal, a member of the same family as Ferdinand Magellan. (read on line on chineancienne.fr and here). Mission to China After first spending six years in the Portuguese colony of Goa, Magalh√£es arrived in Hangzhou in 1640. He was then sent to Chengdu in Sichuan and arrived in August 1642. He began a close association with fellow Jesuit Lodovico Buglio in Chengdu, and started to study Chinese under Buglio's guidance. Buglio would become his biographer 35 years later. Both Magalh√£es and Buglio were pressed to served under the rebel \\"King of the West\\", Zhang Xianzhong () after Zhang captured Sichuan in 1644. Initially Magalh√£es wrote sympathetically of Zhang's attempts at empire-building in Chengdu, but became fearful when Zhang started his campaign of terror in Sichuan. After Zhang was defeated by the Manchus in 1647, the pair was captured by Hooge. In his plea to avoid execution, Magalh√£es claimed the German Jesuit Adam Schall as their \\"elder brother\\" who was recognized by the Manchu commander. They was taken to the Forbidden City in Peking in 1648 where they was well received by the Shunzhi emperor, and were given a church, house and income. He and Buglio undertook the construction of the original St. Joseph‚Äôs Church in Peking (originally known as Dong Tang or Eastern Church). Magalh√£es was given the duty of maintaining various Western machinery, including the clocks at the court of the Shunzhi and Kangxi emperors. He built a number of mechanical devices, including a carillon and turret clock that played a Chinese tune on the hour. After the death of the Shunzhi emperor, anti-Christian sentiments surfaced, and in 1661, during the reign of the Kangxi emperor, Magalh√£es was charged with bribery. He was imprisoned and tortured, but later released as the charges were not sustained. Magalh√£es died in Peking on 6 May 1677 and the Kangxi emperor himself wrote Magalh√£es' eulogy, and granted his estate 200 taels of silver and ten large bolts of silk. Works Starting in 1650, Magalh√£es began writing \\"the most comprehensive and perceptive description of China\\" in the second half of the 17th century, and it was completed in 1668. After Magalh√£es' death, the work was taken to Europe by the French Jesuit Philippe Couplet in 1681, and was translated by Abb√© Claude Bernou. It was published under the title Nouvelle Relation de la Chine, contenant la description des particularitez les plus considerables de ce grand empire in 1688. The work was originally written in Portuguese as Doze excellencias da China (Twelve excellences of China) and deals with various aspects of China, such as its history, language, custom, and government. Part of the document however was damaged by fire, and there were therefore alterations and deletions in the translation. The translation was reorganized into 21 chapters instead of the original 12, and was published under its new French title with the author's name gallicized as Gabriel de Magaillans. It was also translated into English the same year as A New History of China Containing a Description of the Most Considerable Particulars of that Vast Empire. Magalh√£es also left works in Chinese ‚Äì including the translation of De resurrectione carnis (Âæ©Ê¥ªË´ñ), which is part of the supplement to pars tertia of Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologica (Ë∂ÖÊÄßÂ≠∏Ë¶Å) previously partly translated into Chinese by Buglio. Legacy Magalh√£es and his fellow missionaries left a positive impression on the Kangxi emperor who described them as \\"devoted to the public good.\\" He went on: > \\"They have done nothing wrong, yet many Chinese have mistrusted them. > However, We have always known that they are sincere and trustworthy. We have > for many years carefully observed their behaviour and found that they have > done absolutely nothing improper.\\" This recognition by the emperor laid the foundation for the edict of toleration of 1692.

This measure, first introduced by K√∂rner in the 1970s, has since also proven itself useful in other settings, including combinatorics. Definition Let G = (V, E) be an undirected graph. The graph entropy of G, denoted H(G) is defined as ::H(G) = \\\\min_{X,Y} I(X ; Y) where X is chosen uniformly from V, Y ranges over independent sets of G, the joint distribution of X and Y is such that X\\\\in Y with probability one, and I(X ; Y) is the mutual information of X and Y.G. Simonyi, \\"Perfect graphs and graph entropy. An updated survey,\\" Perfect Graphs, John Wiley and Sons (2001) pp. 293-328, Definition 2‚Äù That is, if we let \\\\mathcal{I} denote the independent vertex sets in G, we wish to find the joint distribution X,Y on V \\\\times \\\\mathcal{I} with the lowest mutual information such that (i) the marginal distribution of the first term is uniform and (ii) in samples from the distribution, the second term contains the first term almost surely. The mutual information of X and Y is then called the entropy of G. Properties * Monotonicity. If G_1 is a subgraph of G_2 on the same vertex set, then H(G_1) \\\\leq H(G_2). * Subadditivity. Given two graphs G_1 = (V, E_1) and G_2 = (V, E_2) on the same set of vertices, the graph union G_1 \\\\cup G_2 = (V, E_1 \\\\cup E_2) satisfies H(G_1 \\\\cup G_2) \\\\leq H(G_1) + H(G_2). * Arithmetic mean of disjoint unions. Let G_1, G_2, \\\\cdots, G_k be a sequence of graphs on disjoint sets of vertices, with n_1, n_2, \\\\cdots, n_k vertices, respectively. Then H(G_1 \\\\cup G_2 \\\\cup \\\\cdots G_k) = \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{k}n_i}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{k}{n_i H(G_i)}. Additionally, simple formulas exist for certain families classes of graphs. * Edge-less graphs have entropy 0. * Complete graphs on n vertices have entropy \\\\log_2 n. * Complete balanced k-partite graphs have entropy \\\\log_2 k. In particular, complete balanced bipartite graphs have entropy 1. * Complete bipartite graphs with n vertices in one partition and m in the other have entropy H\\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{m+n}\\\\right), where H is the binary entropy function. Example Here, we use properties of graph entropy to provide a simple proof that a complete graph G on n vertices cannot be expressed as the union of fewer than \\\\log_2 n bipartite graphs. Proof By monotonicity, no bipartite graph can have graph entropy greater than that of a complete bipartite graph, which is bounded by 1. Thus, by sub-additivity, the union of k bipartite graphs cannot have entropy greater than k. Now let G = (V, E) be a complete graph on n vertices. By the properties listed above, H(G) = \\\\log_2 n. Therefore, the union of fewer than \\\\log_2 n bipartite graphs cannot have the same entropy as G, so G cannot be expressed as such a union. \\\\blacksquare General References * Notes Category:Information theory Category:Graph theory ","title":"Graph entropy"},{"id":"52204425","text":"Biccavolu mandal is one of the 65 mandals in East Godavari district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

The most recent phylogenetic examinations confirm its status as at least a sister group to euphractines, along with Paleuphractus, Doellotatus and Proeuphractus.Kieren J.

(Xenarthra: Glyptodontidae) reveals that glyptodonts evolved from Eocene armadillos\\". Molecular Ecology. 25 (14): 3499‚Äì3508.  Biology  Macroeuphractus is one of the few known xenarthrans to have specialised extensively for a carnivorous lifestyle. Modern euphractine armadillos (such as the modern six-banded armadillo) are fairly dedicated omnivores, but Macroeuphractus shows several features that indicate hypercarnivory: * large, conical caniniform teeth * an enlarged temporal fossa * more developed muscles pertaining to the temporalis musculature (as evidenced by the more prominent muscle scars) * a deeper rostrum * more powerful anterior teeth (particularly in the enlarged and caniniform M2) * a deeper and more robust zygomatic arch * a greater moment arm of the temporalis muscle than in other armadillos These features are unusual among xenarthrans but are more in line with predatory mammal groups.Sergio F. Vizca√≠no and Gerardo De Iuliis, Evidence for Advanced Carnivory in Fossil Armadillos (Mammalia: Xenarthra: Dasypodidae) , Paleobiology Vol. 29, No. 1 (Winter, 2003)Darin A. Croft, Horned Armadillos and Rafting Monkeys: The Fascinating Fossil Mammals of South America, Indiana University Press, 29/08/2016 Like most armadillos, Macroeuphractus was fossorial, and it probably could dig out small and medium-sized mammals such as caviomorph rodents, small notoungulates and argyrolagoidean paucituberculates. Species like Macroeuphractus outesi were fairly large and presumably had an apex predator status in their faunal communities.  Paleoecology  Macroeuphractus moreni was a rather widespread species, and played a role in various faunal communities in the Miocene and Pliocene epochs of South America, while the other two species had a more limited range in Argentina. The genus occurs in an epoch where sparassodonts, phorusrhacids and sebecids entered in decline, and was among the various mammal groups to exploit this ecological vacancy prior to the arrival of North American carnivorans in the Pleistocene, alongside giant opossums such as Thylophorops.Prevosti, Francisco J.; Anal√≠a Forasiepi; Natalia Zimicz (2013). \\"The Evolution of the Cenozoic Terrestrial Mammalian Predator Guild in South America: Competition or Replacement?\\". Journal of Mammalian Evolution. 20: 3‚Äì21. doi:10.1007/s10914-011-9175-9. Nonetheless, Macroeuphractus still co- existed with late surviving sparassodonts such as Thylacosmilus and phorusrhacids like Llallawavis.

Charlotte Hollingsworth at Morbidlybeautiful.com said \\"Overall, Demons is an excellent film that brings something fresh to the exorcism genre.\\" Demons received mostly positive reviews, although Noel Murray of the Los Angeles Times had this to say, \\"The ambitious auteur is getting better at making his novelistic ideas punchy and cinematic, but \\"Demons\\" is still a B-movie that takes itself too seriously ... Still, Doleac's forging a niche. His name on a picture is now an indication that genre fans will see something different ‚Ä¶\\". Doleac also appears as a guest vocalist on the 2017 Grammy winning album by thrash metal band Megadeth, Dystopia, performing the Latin voiceover in the instrumental, \\"Conquer or Die!\\" Doleac's fourth original film titled Hallowed Ground released June 7, 2019.\\".

Biography  He was born in Alcamo in the (province of Trapani), between 1555 and 1560, as his parents (Niccol√≤ Bonafino from Savoca (in the province of Messina), and Caterina Russo,F. M. Mirabella, Cenni degli alcamesi rinomati in scienze, lettere, arti, armi e santit√†, Alcamo, tip.Surdi & C., 1876. had married in 1554. He started his religious life with the Capuchines in the province of Palermo, and after he became a priest, he went on studying to become a preacher but in 1591 he was chosen as the provincial Father. At the end of his office he asked to leave for the missions and so in 1599 he left with Lawrence of Brindisi for Bohemia and Persia where Protestant doctrines were very widespread,Dario Busolini, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani volume 70, Treccani, 2008. in order to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ and defeat heresies.Tommaso Papa: Memorie storiche del clero di Alcamo; ediz.Accademia di studi Cielo d'Alcamo, Alcamo, 1968 There are few anecdotes proving his reputation for holiness which spread at his coming back to Sicily, while from his Latin letters sent to his friend and schoolmate Sebastiano Bagolino, we learn that the mission was successfully proceeding, thanks to the collaboration given by the emperor Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, and that he was completing a collection of sermons with the title In orationem Dominicam seu Mare oceanum concionatorum pauperum. In Sicily Mariano worked for the diffusion of the devotion to the Virgin Mary. This veneration for the Virgin Mary was reinforced by his certainty that he had got some graces (he thought he had been released from temptations and dangers), and by the vision of Our Lady of Stellario which he said he had once had in the friary of Alcamo after his return from Bohemia. After this vision there were other events believed supernatural, among which was his prediction of the healing of a noblewoman from Alcamo and her daughter‚Äôs death, provoked by the same disease. In 1608, after he settled in the Capuchin province of Palermo, he had a certain reputation for holiness: for some months he daily preached in Palermo cathedral and then he went to Trapani, where there was the viceroy marquess Juan Fern√°ndez Pacheco de Vigliena, who he was asked to pray for, and to preach for another period of time in Sanctuary of Maria Santissima Annunziata of Trapani. When the provincial Father Gianmaria from Castelvetrano died, in 1611, he was nominated provincial vicar and then qualificator of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, guardian of the friaries of Trapani (1614) and Marsala (1615). He died in Palermo on 27 July 1621.  Works  The most important part of his works is in his manuscripts: * In orationem Dominicam, quae mare oceanum Concionarum Pauperum nuncupatur, Tom.3, in folio. A collection of sermons * Elucidatio in primam partem Divi Thomae, completed in 1612 * Quaresimale, after his death it was missing between the friaries of Genoa and Palermo and later lost together with his portrait and a picture of ‚Äò‚ÄôOur Lady with Stellario‚Äô‚Äô that had been painted by him. In order to promote the devotion for Our Lady with Stellario he published a series of devotional books (prose and poetic works) * Modus contemplandi coronam beatissimae Virginis Mariae (Palermo 1608), tradotto in italiano dal sacerdote Michele Caruso. * Poemata varia et devotissima in laudem beatissimae Virginis Mariae (1613) * Plures palmulae in folio et alia diversa opuscula carmine et prosa (both edited in Palermo nel 1612) * Officium parvum stellari gaudiosi, dolorosi et gloriosi beatissimae Virginis Mariae (1615) * Labyrinthus beatissimae Virginis Mariae (1615).

After spending two years away in Pro Wrestling Noah, Minoru Suzuki, along with his Suzuki-gun stable, returned to NJPW on January 5, 2017, attacking Okada and his Chaos stable with Suzuki laying out Okada with his finishing maneuver, the Gotch-Style Piledriver. Suzuki then declared war on all of NJPW, stating that his stable would take over all of the promotion's championships, just like they had done in Noah. Okada, however, promised to show Suzuki how far NJPW had come during the two years that Suzuki-gun had been away. The main event was officially announced on January 10. In interviews prior to the match, it was claimed that the bad blood between the two started on May 13, 2007, when Suzuki confronted then 19-year old Okada at an event promoted by √öltimo Drag√≥n. The two have since wrestled three singles matches against each other with Okada having won two and Suzuki one. In the days leading to the event, Suzuki targeted Okada's right knee with one attack taking place at a contract signing the day before the event. The Suzuki-gun return angle resulted in The New Beginning in Sapporo also featuring other prominent matches featuring the stable. On January 4, 2017, at Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome, Tomohiro Ishii and Toru Yano forced their way into the IWGP Tag Team Championship match, originally scheduled between champions Guerrillas of Destiny (Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa) and challengers Great Bash Heel (Togi Makabe and Tomoaki Honma), and then proceeded to win the match to become the new champions. G.B.H., who were not involved in the pinfall that decided the match, remained in position to challenge for the title. The following day, both Chaos' Ishii and Yano as well as G.B.H. were part of the group of wrestlers attacked by the returning Suzuki-gun stable. During the attack, Suzuki-gun's designated heavyweight tag team Killer Elite Squad (Davey Boy Smith Jr. and Lance Archer) targeted Ishii and Yano, and afterwards declared themselves the true IWGP Tag Team Championship, stating that they would regain the title in their first attempt. On January 10, NJPW announced a three-way match between Chaos and Yano, G.B.H. and K.E.S. for The New Beginning in Sapporo. The same three teams were scheduled to face off in another three-way title match six days later at The New Beginning in Osaka. The Sapporo event would also feature a third title match involving members of the returning Suzuki-gun stable with Taichi and Taka Michinoku challenging Chaos' Roppongi Vice (Beretta and Rocky Romero) for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. This also stemmed from the January 5 attack, during which the challengers had targeted the champions. Taichi and Michinoku previously held the title in November 2013. Juice Robinson, who challenged for the NEVER Openweight Championship at the event The NEVER Openweight Championship would also be defended at The New Beginning in Sapporo with champion Hirooki Goto taking on challenger Juice Robinson in his first defense. Goto captured the title at Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome on January 4, but was pinned by Robinson in a ten-man tag team match the following day, leading to NJPW announcing the title match on January 10. The event would also include a ten-man tag team match, where the Los Ingobernables de Japon stable of Bushi, Evil, Hiromu Takahashi, Sanada and Tetsuya Naito were set to take on Dragon Lee, Hiroshi Tanahashi, Manabu Nakanishi, Michael Elgin and Ryusuke Taguchi. This match built to title matches taking place six days later at The New Beginning in Osaka, where Naito would defend the IWGP Intercontinental Championship against Elgin and Takahashi would defend the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Lee, while Tanahashi, Nakanishi and Taguchi defend the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship against Bushi, Evil and Sanada. The undercard would feature two more matches involving Suzuki-gun with Takashi Iizuka taking on Chaos' Yoshi-Hashi, while El Desperado and Yoshinobu Kanemaru take on Hirai Kawato and Kushida. The New Beginning in Sapporo was noteworthy for Kenny Omega and the entire Bullet Club stable being absent from the event. Reception Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter gave the main event four and three quarter stars out of five, making a case for Suzuki to be added to the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame. Comparing it to Okada's previous month's match against Kenny Omega, Meltzer wrote that while the Omega match \\"set standards for drama, stamina and durability\\", the Suzuki match was \\"more likely to be used in wrestling schools as an example of babyface selling, psychology, comebacks, and taking a match to a point where it comes across no longer as entertainment but as close to dramatic sport as could be possible in the genre without going full bore shoot style\\".

The event took place on February 11, 2017, in Osaka, Osaka, at Edion Arena Osaka and featured nine matches, five of which were contested for championships. In the main event, Tetsuya Naito defended the IWGP Intercontinental Championship against Michael Elgin. This was the twelfth event under the New Beginning name and the fourth under the New Beginning in Osaka name. Production=Background The event aired worldwide on NJPW's internet streaming site, NJPW World, with English commentary provided by Kevin Kelly and Don Callis, the latter of whom replaced Kelly's previous broadcast partner Steve Corino. The event was sold out by January 25. Storylines Tetsuya Naito, who defended the IWGP Intercontinental Championship in the main event Dragon Lee, who challenged for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship The New Beginning in Osaka featured nine professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The New Beginning in Osaka was main evented by Tetsuya Naito making his third defense of the IWGP Intercontinental Championship against Michael Elgin. Naito originally won the title from Elgin on September 25, 2016, at Destruction in Kobe. A rematch between the two had been scheduled for Power Struggle on November 5, but on October 10, Elgin suffered a legitimate broken left eye socket, while taking a dropkick from Naito, which forced him to pull out of the match. Elgin remained sidelined until Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome on January 4, 2017, during which he won the pre-show New Japan Rumble. Later that same day, Elgin confronted Naito, after he had successfully defended the Intercontinental Championship against Hiroshi Tanahashi, threatening to crush his jaw as revenge for his orbital fracture. The following day, Elgin pinned Naito in a tag team match to cement his status as Naito's next challenger. The match was officially announced on January 10. Another top match would see new IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion Hiromu Takahashi make his first title defense against Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) wrestler Dragon Lee. The two had developed a storyline rivalry with each other in CMLL, where NJPW had sent Takahashi on a learning excursion. Takahashi, then known as \\"Kamaitachi\\", had entered CMLL wearing a mask, but lost it to Dragon Lee during their rivalry in a Lucha de Apuestas Mask vs. Mask match. The rivalry also made it to Japan during the CMLL and NJPW co-produced Fantastica Mania 2016, when Kamaitachi made a surprise appearance on the January 23 event, attacking Dragon Lee. This led to a match the following day, where Kamaitachi defeated Dragon Lee to become the new CMLL World Super Lightweight Champion. After losing the title back to Dragon Lee on March 4, Takahashi's tour of CMLL ended and he returned to NJPW under his real name in November 2016, winning the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship at Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome. The following day, Dragon Lee made a surprise appearance, attacking Takahashi during a match and posing with his IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship belt afterwards, insinuating he wanted a title match. The match was officially announced five days later. Before the title match, Takahashi and Lee faced off during the NJPW and CMLL co-produced Fantastica Mania 2017 tour. During the January 20 event, Takahashi attacked Lee after he had successfully defended the CMLL World Lightweight Championship against B√°rbaro Cavernario, but was laid out himself. On the final day of the tour, January 22, Lee attacked Takahashi after a match, but this time Takahashi got the better of the exchange and unmasked his Osaka challenger. Lee stated that were he to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship, he could have title matches in both Mexico and Japan, even bringing up the possibility of defending the title against his older brother M√≠stico. Lee also stated that the title would allow him to realize one of his dreams of taking part in NJPW's annual Best of the Super Juniors tournament. The IWGP Tag Team Championship would also be defended at The New Beginning in Osaka in a three-way match involving Chaos (Tomohiro Ishii and Toru Yano), G.B.H. (Togi Makabe and Tomoaki Honma) and Suzuki-gun's Davey Boy Smith Jr. and Takashi Iizuka. This was originally scheduled to be a rematch from The New Beginning in Sapporo on February 5 with Smith teaming with his regular K.E.S. partner Lance Archer, however, Archer had to pull out of the event due to a herniated disc in his back, leading to Iizuka taking his spot. Will Ospreay, who challenged for the British Heavyweight Championship The New Beginning in Osaka also featured Katsuyori Shibata taking on Will Ospreay. Originally announced on January 10 as a \\"special singles match\\", the match was to become a title match, contested for the British Heavyweight Championship, provided that Shibata first retained the title during his tour of English promotion Revolution Pro Wrestling, taking place later in January. On January 21, Shibata successfully defended the title against Matt Riddle in London, England, which led to NJPW officially announcing two days later that the match in Osaka would be contested for the title. As part of NJPW's working relationship with RevPro, Shibata made his debut for the English promotion in July 2016, winning the British Heavyweight Championship from Zack Sabre Jr. the following November. The match between Shibata and Ospreay was set up on January 5, 2017, when Ospreay confronted Shibata and told him that he had something Ospreay wanted. The final title match of the event would see Hiroshi Tanahashi, Manabu Nakanishi and Ryusuke Taguchi defend the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship against the Los Ingobernables de Japon trio of Bushi, Evil and Sanada. Bushi, Evil and Sanada won the title in a four-team gauntlet match at Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome, but lost it the following day to Tanahashi, Nakanishi and Taguchi in what marked Nakanishi's first title win in seven and a half years. On January 10, NJPW announced a rematch between the two teams for The New Beginning in Osaka. Other notable matches included Kazuchika Okada and Minoru Suzuki facing off in a six-man tag team match, six days after their IWGP Heavyweight Championship match at The New Beginning in Sapporo, where Okada retained the title. Okada teams with his Chaos partners and reigning IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions Roppongi Vice (Beretta and Rocky Romero), while Suzuki teams with his Suzuki-gun partners Taichi and Yoshinobu Kanemaru. Originally Suzuki's partners were announced as Taichi and Taka Michinoku, who challenged Roppongi Vice for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship in Sapporo, however, after losing the match, their Suzuki-gun stablemates El Desperado and Kanemaru stepped up as the next challengers, which led to them being switched as Suzuki's partners on February 6. However, two days later, NJPW announced that El Desperado would be forced to miss the event due to a knee injury, which led to Taichi being added back to the match. switch in the Osaka card the following day. The New Beginning in Osaka was noteworthy for Kenny Omega and the entire Bullet Club stable being absent from the event. Reception Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter gave the main event between Naito and Elgin a full five-star rating, stating that \\"Naito is clearly New Japan's MVP right now\\".

(1959), Scouting Round the World. First edition, Blandford Press. p. 120 Early life Haydn Dimmock was born in Luton in Bedfordshire and began his education at Enfield, which was then in Middlesex. Dimmock's first encounter with Scouting came in 1909, when a schoolmaster gave him a copy of an early edition of The Scout, which he was told was better than \\"the trash which I so very often have to confiscate\\".Gordon, Alan and Brooks, Peter (editors), 75 Years of Scouting: A history of the Scout Movement in words and pictures, The Scout Association (1982), ISSN 0263-5410 (p. 58) Dimmock was immediately enthralled, and finding that there was no local Scout troop, started his own patrol. Shortly afterwards, his parents moved to Musselburgh where there was a Scout troop, but later they returned to Enfield. There, Dimmock joined the 5th Enfield Scouts in 1911; he edited the troop's magazine which was so successful that it led to an introduction to Percy Everett, later the Deputy Chief Scout and the editor-in-chief at C. Arthur Pearson, Ltd., the publisher of The Scout. Dimmock was taken on at Pearson's in the post of \\"office boy\\". The Scout Dimmock served with the British Army during the First World War and was wounded. On his return from military service he became the editor of the magazine The Scout, a position he would hold for 35 years. During his time with the magazine, Dimmock initiated a number of ventures to promote both the magazine and Scouting in general like running a daily Scout newspaper at the 3rd World Scout Jamboree, persuading Ralph Reader to produce his Gang Shows in a West End theatre, organising Scout \\"Train Cruises\\" around the United Kingdom, introducing the soap box derby from America, and devising \\"Bob-a-Job Week\\", an annual fundraising campaign in which Scouts did small jobs in the community in return for a donation of a shilling or \\"bob\\" (equal to 5 new pence). In 1940, publication of The Scout was taken over by the Boy Scouts Association and Dimmock became a member of the Imperial Headquarters staff. In the following year, he was appointed to the additional role of Acting Publicity Secretary.The Scout Association (2006), An Official History of Scouting, Hamlyn (p. 175) Science fiction The first British science fiction magazine was launched in 1934, when Pearson's launched Scoops, a weekly in tabloid format aimed at the juvenile market. Soon Dimmock, Scoops' editor, began to receive more sophisticated stories, targeted at an adult audience; he tried to change the magazine's focus to include more mature fiction but within twenty issues falling sales led Pearson's to kill the magazine. The failure of Scoops gave British publishers the impression that Britain could not support a science fiction publication. Other work Dimmock penned a total of sixteen popular junior Scout novels, including 'Hazard Hike' and 'Scout Family Robinson', three adventure novels about the Mounties, together with a number of Scout instructional handbooks and an autobiography. He wrote and directed a documentary film about the Scout Movement, Knights of Freedom, which was released in 1947. Dimmock was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire \\"for services to the Boy Scouts Association\\" in the 1951 New Year Honours. He died on 26 April 1955, only a year after his retirement. His obituary in the May 1955 edition of The Scouter was written by Lord Rowallan, the Chief Scout, who paid tribute to Dimmock's skill as an orator, artist and innovator, and concluded: \\"...thank God for that life, short by modern standards but so rich in achievement. Goodbye, Dim, and thank you\\".

Graduate of the Beaux-Arts de Grenoble, his work has been the subject of many gallery and museum shows, including his retrospective at the Maison Europ√©ene de la Photographie, at the Fondation Maeght, as well being sold in public auction, including the work 'Couteau' sold by Sotheby's Paris in the sale 'The Secret Garden of Marianne and Pierre Nahon' in 2004.  Work  Since the 1980s, Philippe Perrin has been an unconventional figure on the international art scene, known for his short temper and bad-boy image, exploring the inter merging of reality and fiction, evoking in his work symbols of violence taken from a variety of genres, such as crime fiction, cinema, or popular culture, notably he pays with the question of scale of the object, such as the revolver or a razor blade. His fascination with fictional characters or symbols of the underworld : the gram of coke becomes a kilogram, or a razor blade, a revolver and other symbols of violence are presented on a large scale. For the French art critic Nicolas Bourriaud, \\"Perrin is a manipulator of signs, interpreting the relationship between reality and fiction through a question of scale, treating in the same manner the relation between a true biography and that of the figure of a celebrity.\\" A work representative of Perrin's language of allegory-visual suggestion his \\"Skyline\\": seven ball cartridges of variable sizes respect the measures of the space where they are inserted, forming a front: first line of a fighting army or a skyscrapers seafront. \\"All art is political.

It has an estimated elevation of above sea level. A short distance west of Dennison siding, the Kaibab Limestone that is predominant in the western part of the state first rises above the limestone Moenkopi Formation found to the east. In 1910, the railroad was double-tracked from Winslow, Arizona, to a point two miles west of Dennison. By 1972, Dennison was only a phone station on the railroad line. At that time, the name had fallen out of public use, and local landowners successfully petitioned the county to change the name of Dennison Road, exit 239 on Interstate 40, to Red Gap Ranch Road and Meteor City Road. Incidents On 1 September 1891 two men were killed on the line between Dennison and Winslow when a wagon carrying blasting powder on a freight train exploded. On 28 March 1899, trackwalker George Smiley shot and killed Dennison section foreman, Paul McSweeney, following a dispute over unpaid wages. Smiley was executed on 8 January the following year. On 1 July 1899 a light engine ran into the back of a freight train in the siding at Dennison, killing a brakeman and an engineer.

Loaned to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1942, the vessel served on both coasts of Canada as a convoy escort and patrol vessel. Following the war, the minesweeper was returned to the Royal Navy and laid up. Ingonish was discarded in 1948. Design and description A British design, the Bangor-class minesweepers were smaller than the preceding s in British service, but larger than the in Canadian service.Chesneau, p. 64Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 177 They came in two versions powered by different engines; those with a diesel engines and those with vertical triple- expansion steam engines. Ingonish was of the latter design and was larger than her diesel-engined cousins. Ingonish was long overall, had a beam of and a draught of . The minesweeper had a displacement of . She had a complement of 6 officers and 77 enlisted. Ingonish had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three- drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The minesweeper could carry a maximum of of fuel oil. British Bangor-class minesweepers were armed with a single 12-pounder () 12 cwt HA gun mounted forward. For anti-aircraft purposes, the minesweepers were equipped with one QF 2-pounder Mark VIII and two single-mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns. As a convoy escort, Ingonish was deployed with 40 depth charges launched from two depth charge throwers and four chutes.Macpherson (1997), p. 38 Operational history The minesweeper was ordered as part of the British 1940 construction programme. The ship's keel was laid down on 6 June 1941 by North Vancouver Ship Repairs at their yard in North Vancouver, British Columbia. Named for a community in Nova Scotia, Ingonish was launched on 30 July 1941. Transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy, the ship was commissioned on 8 May 1942 at Vancouver.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 179 Following work ups, the minesweeper joined Esquimalt Force in May 1942, the local patrol and convoy escort force operating out of Esquimalt, British Columbia. Ingonish was one of the warships added to the west coast patrol force after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The main duty of Bangor-class minesweepers after commissioning on the West Coast was to perform the Western Patrol. This consisted of patrolling the west coast of Vancouver Island, inspecting inlets and sounds and past the Scott Islands to Gordon Channel at the entrance to the Queen Charlotte Strait and back.Douglas et al., No Higher Purpose, pp. 349, 352 The minesweeper was later transferred to Prince Rupert Force, the patrol and escort unit operating out of Prince Rupert, British Columbia and remained on the Pacific coast until March 1943, when Ingonish was ordered to the Atlantic Coast of Canada. After arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 30 April 1943, the minesweeper was assigned to the Western Local Escort Force as a convoy escort. In June, Ingonish transferred to Halifax Force, the local escort and patrol force operating from Halifax. That November, the warship was sent to Baltimore, Maryland for a refit, which took nine weeks to complete. In May 1944, the minesweeper joined Sydney Force, the local patrol and escort force working out of Sydney, Nova Scotia and remained with the unit until February 1945. The vessel returned to Halifax Force in February and underwent a second refit at Saint John, New Brunswick. Following the refit, Ingonish was sent to Bermuda for work ups and then sailed for the United Kingdom in June 1945. The minesweeper was paid off and returned to the Royal Navy at Sheerness on 2 July 1945. Never entering service with the Royal Navy, the vessel was placed in reserve. Ingonish was sold on 1 January 1948 to Clayton & Davie for scrap and broken up at Dunston, Tyne and Wear.Colledge, p. 316 References=NotesCitationsSources  * * External links * * Category:Ships of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:Bangor-class minesweepers of the Royal Navy Category:Ships built in British Columbia Category:1941 ships Category:World War II minesweepers of the United Kingdom Category:Bangor-class minesweepers of the Royal Canadian Navy ","title":"HMCS Ingonish"},{"id":"52204854","text":"Neo Mlumbi (born 3 April 1986) is a South African cricketer.

She, among others, was known as a \\"gifted child\\" and a \\"Promil kid\\", having been featured in Wyeth's infant formula ad in 1995. Luna is currently a fashion and advertising photographer represented by the international creative talent agency Jed Root Manila, founded by American businessman Jed Root in 1989.  Early life and education  Shaira Luna was born on September 20, 1986 in Malate, Manila, to businessman Bong Luna and Centro Escolar University dentistry graduate Jenny Luna. Both her parents were in their middle 20's when she was conceived. As an infant, Luna reportedly began speaking fluently as early as six months, and can read and write the alphabet at age one. At age two, Luna became knowledgeable in different branches of science, as well as playing various musical instruments including the piano and the violin. While she spoke English fluently, she also developed interests in learning the French and Spanish languages. Luna's parents then sought professionals' help due to these abilities their daughter were having. A personnel from the Department of Education, Cultural Studies (DECS) discovered that Luna had the IQ of a sixth grader, similar to that of a high-school student. According to Jenny Luna, her daughter's intelligence might have been a result of heredity, as her family consists of achievers who graduated from school with honors. She then was advised to have her daughter attend a sixth-grade class at the Philippine Christian University (PCU), as she would easily get bored in a kindergarten class. Another reason Luna was enrolled at PCU was to improve her social skills, since she had the tendency to be reserved. Luna was 13 years old when she enrolled at De La Salle University, to earn a Bachelor of Science in human biology. After shifting to different courses, she dropped out in 2006. Career While a student at De La Salle University, Luna bought a Canon EOS 350D (her first digital single- lens reflex camera) and dabbled in photography for six months, during which she would \\"literally shoot everything: I tried portraits, I tried food... I would shoot events, birthdays, binyag (Christening), fiesta, basketball ng liga (basketball leagues). Minsan libing din (Sometimes funerals too).\\" In an 2015 interview with When In Manila, she said that \\"Photography was really just a hobby during college. My career developed very gradually and organically‚ÄîI really went through everything before it even occurred to me that this was something that could be done for a living!\\" She described her expertise in the field as \\"self-taught\\". Personal life Luna is a patron of ukay-ukay stores, a thrift shop in the Philippines.

Tower 1 is 302 meters (991 feet) tall, and has 69 floors, it is the eighth-tallest skyscraper in Europe. While Tower 2 is 345 meters (1132 feet) tall, with 79 floors, and is the fourth- tallest skyscraper in Europe. The complex is currently under construction and is expected to be completed in two stages: first stage was commissioned in 2019 and the second stage is to be completed in late 2020.  History = Origins  Plots 17 and 18 of the MIBC were to be used originally for the Russia Tower, a supertall skyscraper designed by Norman Foster, but the Great Recession and issues with investors forced development of the project to be cancelled. On 2014, ownership of half of the plot was transferred to Turkish company R√∂nesans Holding. As general contractor, R√∂nesans Holding hired ST Towers LLC to develop a new complex, the Renaissance Moscow Towers, later renamed the Neva Towers. The project would also be developed by the SPEECH Architectural Bureau in partnership with American companies HOK and FXCollaborative, with public spaces designed by Hirsch Bedner Associates. The management of the complex claimed to receive a LEED Gold certificate.  Construction  Sales of the apartments in the complex opened in September 2016. Investments for the complex exceeded $1 billion later in November 2016. On 15 October 2018, Tower 2 of the Neva Towers was architecturally topped out when work on the 79th floor was completed. Construction of the first stage of the project is 70% completed.  Design  The plots Neva Towers are to be built on have a total area of 2.41 hectares. The total area of the complex will be 349.2 thousand square meters. The complex will be composed of a single four-story stylobate where the two towers will be built on top. Tower 2 will be a 79-story residential skyscraper with a height of 345 meters. Tower 1 will be a 69-story skyscraper with a height of 302 meters with office space proposed on the 28th floor. In the complex would be a private park with an area of seven thousand square meters. In addition, the complex would have a hotel and a fitness center with a swimming pool located on Tower 2. There is also a parking lot with a planned capacity of 2,040 cars for workers and residents of the complex. Stone plates of light stone are to be used to decorate the skyscrapers.

Loaned to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1942, the minesweeper saw service on both coasts of Canada as a patrol vessel and convoy escort. Returned to the Royal Navy in 1945, Lockeport was discarded in 1948. Design and description A British design, the Bangor-class minesweepers were smaller than the preceding s in British service, but larger than the in Canadian service.Chesneau, p. 64Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 177 They came in two versions powered by different engines; those with a diesel engines and those with vertical triple-expansion steam engines. Lockeport was of the latter design and was larger than her diesel-engined cousins. Lockeport was long overall, had a beam of and a draught of . The minesweeper had a displacement of . She had a complement of 6 officers and 77 enlisted. Lockeport had two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The minesweeper could carry a maximum of of fuel oil. British Bangor-class minesweepers were armed with a single 12-pounder () 12 cwt HA gun mounted forward. For anti- aircraft purposes, the minesweepers were equipped with one QF 2-pounder Mark VIII and two single-mounted QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns. As a convoy escort, Lockeport was deployed with 40 depth charges launched from two depth charge throwers and four chutes.Macpherson (1997), p. 38 Operational history The minesweeper was ordered as part of the British 1940 construction programme. The ship's keel was laid down on 17 June 1941 by North Vancouver Ship Repairs at their yard in North Vancouver, British Columbia. Named for a community in Nova Scotia, Lockeport was launched on 22 August 1941. Transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy, the ship was commissioned on 27 May 1942 at Vancouver.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 179 Following work ups, the minesweeper joined Esquimalt Force in May 1942, the local patrol and convoy escort force operating out of Esquimalt, British Columbia. Lockeport was one of the warships added to the west coast patrol force after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The main duty of Bangor-class minesweepers after commissioning on the West Coast was to perform the Western Patrol. This consisted of patrolling the west coast of Vancouver Island, inspecting inlets and sounds and past the Scott Islands to Gordon Channel at the entrance to the Queen Charlotte Strait and back.Douglas et al., No Higher Purpose, pp. 349, 352 On 20 June 1942, the shelled the lighthouse at Estevan Point on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Lockeport, which had been returning to port after a patrol, was among the warships sent to respond to the attack, arriving 5 hours after the attack. No contact with the Japanese submarine was made.Douglas et al., No Higher Purpose, pp. 355‚Äì57 Lockeport remained with Esquimalt Force until ordered to the Atlantic Coast of Canada in March 1943. After arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 30 April 1943 the minesweeper was assigned to the Western Local Escort Force as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. In June 1943, the vessel joined Halifax Force, the local patrol and escort force operating from Halifax. In November, Lockeport was sent to join Newfoundland Force, the patrol and escort force operating from St. John's, Newfoundland. However, in December the minesweeper was withdrawn due to engine troubles. Lockeport was sent to Baltimore, Maryland to undergo a refit and while in transit on 9 January 1944, her engines broke down. The minesweeper sailed under an improvised sail before a ship capable of towing her arrived. Work ups were performed in Bermuda and Lockeport escorted the 78th Motor Launch Flotilla on her return to Nova Scotia. In May 1944, the warship was assigned to the patrol and escort force operating from Sydney, Nova Scotia, Sydney Force. The minesweeper remained with this unit until leaving Canada in May 1945 for the United Kingdom. The minesweeper was paid off on 2 July 1945 at Sheerness and returned to the Royal Navy.Colledge, p. 372 The vessel never entered service with the Royal Navy and was laid up following her return. Lockeport was sold on 1 January 1948 and broken up at Gateshead.

It serves the residents from two buildings, the Main Library and the Bellevue Avenue Branch. It is a member of the Bergen County Cooperative Library System. History The Montclair Public Library had its beginnings with the founding of the Montclair Library Association, a 30-person subscription-based organization started by Israel Crane in 1869. On April 12, 1893 citizens of Montclair voted to establish a free public library. It was housed on the second floor of Dr. John J.H. Love's office at 16 Church Street. Mary F. Weeks served as the first Library Director, until 1897. An abandoned inn (called Munn Tavern) was purchased and became the new home for the Library in 1898. A branch was established in 1899 in a rented room in the real estate office of John Mancini on Bellevue Avenue, near the train station. The first building constructed solely for the library was completed in 1904 with $40,000 from the Carnegie Corporation. This building at 73 Church Street served as the main library for 50 years. This building is now part of the Unitarian Church, located at the intersection of Valley Road and Church Street. In 1913, the Carnegie Corporation gave Montclair a second sum of $40,000 for the construction of the Bellevue Avenue Branch. Designed by the architect Francis A. Nelson, the branch opened on December 26, 1914. In 1927, Margery Quigley became the sixth director of the library. Her book \\"Portrait of a Library\\", co-authored with William Marcus, the library board president, was revolutionary for changing the concept of public libraries from that of a place for quiet reading to that of a dynamic information center. It drew the attention of Director Hans Burger, who developed a film of the same name in 1940, which was distributed by the Museum of Modern Art and shown throughout the world under the auspices of the U.S. Department of State. In February 1942, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) designed the first ever punch card data processing system for the library, also making the first public library in the United States to have a computerized circulation system.Guy A. Marco, \\"The American Public Library Handbook\\", ABC-CLIO, 2011, page 370.John Carlo Bertot, Paul T. Jaeger, Charles R. McClure, \\"Public Libraries and the Internet: Roles, Perspectives, and Implications\\", Libraries Unlimited, 2010, page 60. In 1955 the Davella Mills Foundation donated the former site of Dr. Love's home, whose offices served as the first library, as the site for the new library building. They also contributed $250,000 toward the $800,000 construction cost. Designed by Ralph Walker of Voorhees, Walker, Foley and Smith was noted for its large glass windows and an absence of internal load bearing walls.Marco (2011), page 287. In 1996 the Main Library closed for an extensive renovation and expansion, reopening a year later. In 2002 it was named one of the top five libraries in the nation by Library Journal.http://www.northjersey.com/news/separate-tax-levy-for-montclair- public-library-to-take-effect-this- year-1.305746?page=allhttp://lj.libraryjournal.com/2002/06/awards/2002-library- of-the-year-kalamazoo-public-library-kalamazoo-michigan/ Directors * Mary F.

It attempts to protect the environment of a region of forest and flooded fields close to the state capital, Macap√°, and also to preserve the values and culture of the traditional population, which is of African descent. It is threatened by urban expansion. Location The Rio Curia√∫ Environmental Protection Area (APA) is in the municipality of Macap√°, Amap√°, about from the city center, and has an area of . The Curia√∫ River, which gives its name to the APA, rises in the APA and flows southeast into the Amazon. The EAP-070 highway from Macap√° runs through the APA from south to north. The APA is bounded to the east by the Amazon River, to the north by the Pescada stream and the road linking the EAP-070 highway to BR-210, to the west by the Amap√° railroad, and to the south by an E-W line that divides it from the urban area of Macap√° to the south. History One account says the settlement was founded about three centuries ago by an settler of African origin, Sr. Miranda, his wife and seven slaves, all brothers, who decided this would be a good place to raise cattle. Another says the Vila do Curia√∫ and other communities in the region were settled in the 18th century by slaves who revolted and fled from construction of the fortress of S√£o Jos√© de Macap√°. There may be truth in both stories, since escaped slaves may have found refuge with the original settlers. The traditional population of quilombolas is of African descent. The APA was created by Amap√° state decree 1417 of 28 September 1992, and by decree 1418 the Vila do Curia√∫ was recognized as Cultural Heritage of Amap√° due to the popular culture of the African Brazilians in the communities. The goal was to prevent damage to the ecosystems of the Curia√∫ River basin due to the unplanned urban expansion of Macap√°, and to preserve the social values and culture of the quilombo residents. On 15 September 1998 law 0431 repealed decree 1417 and recreated the Rio Curia√∫ APA with changed boundaries, reducing its area by about . The management board of the APA was created by state decree 3099 in 2001, and includes representatives of public authorities and of organized civil society. The APA was made part of the Amap√° Biodiversity Corridor, created in 2003. Environment The K√∂ppen climate classification is Af (humid tropical). Average annual temperatures are around and average annual rainfall about . Relative humidity averages 85%. Vegetation includes v√°rzea and cerrado forests and fields. The Curia√∫ River basin is about of which about 40% is in the APA. The river is influenced by tides and by storms. It runs through the center of the APA in the region of flooded fields, which are completely flooded for much of the year. There are three soil types, oxisol, gleysol and alluvial soil. Oxisols, mostly associated with the cerrado ecosystem, cover about 44% of the APA in flat or gently rolling terrain. They are poorly drained, high in clay and low in fertility. The gleysols are found in the v√°rzea forest and flooded fields, covering 43% of the APA. They have poor drainage but constantly receive fresh sediments during periods of flooding, and are suitable for growing rice and natural pastures. Alluvial soils cover 6% of the APA in the gallery forest environment, and have good fertility. Economy The Vila do Curia√∫ is considered a Historical and Ecological Site. The main economic activities are subsistence agriculture and plant and animal extraction. As of 1999 there were about 1,500 people in five communities, Curia√∫ de Dentro, Curia√∫ de Fora, Casa Grande, Curralinho and Mocambo. Rapid population growth in Macap√° is causing the urban area to extend into the APA. The communities are responding to economic and cultural pressures by abandoning their traditional occupations and knowledge in favor of other ways of making a living.

Radio acoustic ranging, occasionally written as \\"radio-acoustic ranging\\" and sometimes abbreviated RAR, was a method for determining a ship's precise location at sea by detonating an explosive charge underwater near the ship, detecting the arrival of the underwater sound waves at remote locations, and radioing the time of arrival of the sound waves at the remote stations to the ship, allowing the ship's crew to use true range multilateration to determine the ship's position. Developed by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1923 and 1924 for use in accurately fixing the position of survey ships during hydrographic survey operations, it was the first navigation technique in human history other than dead reckoning that did not require visual observation of a landmark, marker, light, or celestial body, and the first non-visual means to provide precise positions. First employed operationally in 1924, radio acoustic ranging remained in use until 1944, when new radio navigation techniques developed during World War II rendered it obsolete.

A U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey radioman on duty at radio acoustic ranging station KGHS, Kodiak Island, Territory of Alaska, supporting hydrographic survey operations by the survey ship USC&GS; Surveyor in 1929. To fix their position using radio acoustic ranging, a ship's crew first ascertained the temperature and salinity of sea water in the vicinity of the ship to determine an accurate velocity of sound through the water. The crew then threw a small TNT bomb off the ship's stern. It exploded at a depth of about , and a chronograph aboard the ship automatically recorded the time the explosion was heard at the ship. The sound traveled outward from the explosion, eventually reaching hydrophones at known locations ‚Äì shore stations, anchored station ships, or moored buoys ‚Äì at a distance from the ship. Each hydrophone was connected to a radio transmitter that automatically sent a signal indicating the time its hydrophone detected the sound. At the distances involved ‚Äì generally less than ‚Äì each of these radio signals arrived at the ship at essentially the same instant that each of the remote hydrophones detected the sound of the explosion. The ship's chronograph automatically recorded the time each radio signal arrived at the ship. By subtracting the time of the explosion from the time of radio signal reception, the ship's crew could determine the length of time the sound wave required to travel from the point of the explosion to each remote hydrophone and, knowing the speed of sound in the surrounding sea water, could multiply the sound's travel time by the velocity of sound in sea water to determine the distance between the explosion and the hydrophone. By determining the distance to at least two remote hydrophones in known locations, the ship's crew could use true range multilateration to fix the ship's position.Theberge, Alfred E., \\"System Without Fixed Points: Development of the Radio-Acoustic Ranging Navigation Technique (Part 1),\\" hydro-international.com, December 2, 2009.Rude, Gilbert T., \\"The Modern Chart,\\" Motor Boating, May 1935, pp. 35, 68. In deep waters, such as those that prevailed in the Pacific Ocean along the United States West Coast, the Coast and Geodetic Survey could rely upon shore stations to support radio acoustic ranging because the deep water allowed sound to travel to the coast. Along the United States East Coast, where shallower waters prevailed, sound had greater difficulty in reaching the coast, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey relied more heavily on anchored station ships, and later moored buoys, to support radio acoustic ranging. Chronographs recorded times to the hundredth of a second, and the crew of a ship using radio acoustic ranging could determine their ship's distance from the remote hydrophone stations to within , allowing them to plot their ship's position with great accuracy for the time. With sound waves traveling from the point of the explosion to the distant hydrophones at about , ships occasionally used radio acoustic ranging at distances of over between ship and hydrophone station, and distances of were common. Development history=Precursors Radio acoustic ranging had its origins in a growing understanding of underwater acoustics and their practical application during the early decades of the 20th century, and developed in parallel with echo sounding. The first step took place in the early 1900s, when the Submarine Signal Company invented a submarine bell signalling device and a hydrophone that could serve as a receiver of the underwater sounds the bells generated. The crew of a ship equipped with the receiving hydrophone could plot their ship's distance from the submarine bell mechanism and plot intersecting lines from two or more bells to determine the ship's position. The bells were installed at lighthouses, aboard lightvessels, and on buoys along the coasts of North America and Europe, and receiving hydrophones were mounted aboard hundreds of ships. It was history's first practical use of acoustics in an ocean environment. The sinking of in 1912 spurred the Canadian inventor Reginald Fessenden (1866‚Äì1932) to begin work on a long-distance underwater sound transmission and reception system that could detect hazards in the path of a ship. This led to the invention of the Fessenden oscillator, an electro- acoustic transducer which by 1914 had a proven ability to transmit and receive sound at a distance of 31 miles across Massachusetts Bay and to detect an iceberg ahead of a ship at a range of two miles by bouncing sound off it and detecting the echo, as well as an occasional ability to detect the reflection of sound off the ocean bottom. Further impetus to developing practical applications of underwater acoustics came from World War I, which prompted the Royal Navy, United States Navy, and United States Army Coast Artillery Corps to experiment with sound as a means of detecting submerged submarines. In postwar experiments, the Coast Artillery Corps's Subaqueous Sound Ranging Section conducted experiments in shallow water in Vineyard Sound off Massachusetts in which it detonated explosive charges underwater at the ends of established baselines and measured the amount of time it took for the sound to arrive at hydrophones at the other ends of the baselines in order to establish very accurate measurements of the speed of sound through water. And in 1923, the Submarine Signal Company improved upon its underwater signaling devices by equipping them with radio transmitters that sent signals both to identify the particular device and to indicate to approaching ships that it would generate an acoustic signal at a specific time interval after it sent the radio signal, allowing ships to identify the specific navigational aid they were approaching and to take advantage of a one-way ranging capability that let their crews determine their direction and distance from the navigational aid.hydro-international.com The Discovery of Long-Distance Sound Transmission in the Ocean Nicholas Heck Nicholas H. Heck, photographed ca. 1940.Realizing the potential of these applications of acoustics to hydrographic surveying and navigation, particularly along the United States West Coast, where fog frequently interfered with attempts to fix ship positions accurately, Ernest Lester Jones (1876‚Äì1929), then Director of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, in consultation with United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps officers, decided to investigate the use of acoustics in both depth finding and navigation. Nicholas H. Heck (1882‚Äì1953), a Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps officer, had been assigned from 1917 to 1919 to World War I service with the United States Naval Reserve Force, during which he had researched the use of underwater acoustics in antisubmarine warfare. He was the obvious choice to lead the new effort. By January 1923, the Coast and Geodetic Survey had decided to install a Hayes sonic rangefinder ‚Äì an early echo sounder ‚Äì aboard the survey ship USC&GS; Guide, which the Coast and Geodetic Survey planned to commission into its fleet later that year; successful operation of the sonic rangefinder would require a precise understanding of the speed of sound through water. When Heck contacted E. A. Stephenson of the U.S. Army Coast Artillery Corps to inform him of this plan and to inquire further about the Vineyard Sound experiments, Stephenson suggested that a system of hydrophones detecting the sound of underwater explosions could allow Coast and Geodetic Survey ships to fix their position while conducting surveys. Heck agreed, but believed that existing navigation aids would not meet the needs of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in terms of the immediacy and accuracy of position fixes.NOAA History: The Start of the Acoustic Work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey He envisioned improving on the Submarine Signal Company's system of underwater noise generators and attached radio transmitters, as well as other previous concepts, by creating what would become known as the radio acoustic ranging method. Like echosounding, this method required an accurate calculation of the speed of sound through water.Anonymous, \\"Ocean's Depth Measured By Radio Robot,\\" Popular Mechanics, December 1938, pp. 828-830. Heck oversaw tests at Coast and Geodetic Survey headquarters in Washington, D.C., that demonstrated that shipboard recording of the time of an explosion could be performed accurately enough for his concept to work. He worked with Dr. E. A. Eckhardt, a physicist, and M. Keiser, an electrical engineer, of the National Bureau of Standards to develop a hydrophone system that could automatically send a radio signal when it detected the sound of an underwater explosion. When the Coast and Geodetic Survey commissioned Guide in 1923, Heck had her based at New London, Connecticut. Under his direction, Guide both tested her new echo sounder's ability to make accurate depth soundings and conducted radio acoustic ranging experiments in cooperation with the U.S. Army Coast Artillery Corps. Despite many difficulties, testing of both echo sounding and radio acoustic ranging wrapped up successfully in November 1923. The cruise of the Guide USC&GS; Guide was a survey ship in commission in the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey fleet from 1923 to 1941. She was the first ship to employ radio acoustic ranging operationally. In late November 1923, with Heck aboard, Guide began a voyage from New London via Puerto Rico and the Panama Canal to San Diego, California, where she would be based in the future, with her route planned to take her over a wide variety of ocean depths so that she could continue to test her echo sounder. Guide made history during the voyage, becoming the first Coast and Geodetic Survey ship to use echo sounding to measure and record the depth of the sea at points along her course; she also measured water temperatures and took water samples so that the Scripps Institution for Biological Research (now the Scripps Institution of Oceanography) at La Jolla, California, could measure salinity levels. She also compared echo sounder soundings with those made by lead lines, discovering that using a single speed of sound through water, as had been the previous practice by those conducting echo sounding experiments, yielded acoustic depth-finding results that did not match the depths found by lead lines. Before she reached San Diego in December 1923, she had accumulated much data beneficial to the study of the movement of sound waves through water and measuring their velocity under varying conditions of salinity, density, and temperature, information essential both to depth-finding and radio acoustic ranging. Upon arriving in California, Heck and Guide personnel in consultation with the Scripps Institution developed formulas that allowed accurate echo sounding of depths in all but the shallowest waters and installed hydrophones at La Jolla and Oceanside, California, to allow experimentation with radio acoustic ranging. Under Heck's direction, Guide then conducted experiments off the coast of California during the early months of 1924 that demonstrated that accurate echo sounding was possible using the new formulas. Experiments with radio acoustic ranging, despite initial difficulties, demonstrated that the method also was practical, although difficulty with getting some of the explosive charges to detonate hampered some of the experimental program. In April 1924, the Coast and Geodetic Survey concluded that both echo sounding and radio acoustic ranging were fundamentally sound, with no foundational problems left to solve, and that all that remained necessary was continued development and refinement of both techniques during their operational use. Heck turned over continued development of echo sounding and radio acoustic ranging to Guide's commanding officer, Commander Robert Luce, and returned to his duties in Washington, D.C.

She flies the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey flag from her mast and the national ensign at her stern. Operating in the Pacific Ocean off Oregon in 1924, Guide became the first ship to employ radio acoustic ranging operationally. Off Oregon that year, she successfully employed the technique at a distance of between the ranging explosion and the remote hydrophones detecting its sound and in the process achieved the first observed indication of the ocean sound layer that was later called the sound fixing and ranging (SOFAR) channel or deep sound channel (DSC). In 1928, French investigators extended this range, detonating a 30-kg (66-pound) explosive in the Mediterranean Sea between Algiers in French Algeria and Toulon, France, and detecting the sound at a range of . Initially, Heck and others involved in the development of radio acoustic ranging thought the technique would prove least effective along the coast of the Pacific Northwest, where they assumed that the sound of wave action along the coast and the difficulty of setting up shore stations and cables would reduce the success of radio acoustic ranging; in contrast, they thought that conditions along the United States East Coast would pose no challenges. In fact, the opposite proved true: Among other problems, the relatively shallow water along the U.S. East Coast attenuated the sound of ranging explosions and shoals often blocked the sound from reaching shore at all. To overcome these difficulties, the Coast and Geodetic Survey anchored vessels well offshore along the U.S. East Coast to serve as hydrophone stations. In 1931, the Coast and Geodetic Survey proposed replacing the manned station ships with \\"radio- sonobuoys\\", and in July 1936 it began to place radio-sonobuoys in service. The 700-pound (317.5-kg) buoys ‚Äì equipped with subsurface hydrophones, batteries, and radio transmitters that automatically sent a radio signal when their hydrophones detected the sound of a ranging explosion ‚Äì could be deployed or recovered by Coast and Geodetic Survey ships in five minutes.EVOLUTION OF THE SONOBUOY.pdf Holler, Roger A., \\"The Evolution of the Sonobuoy From World War II to The Cold War,\\" U.S. Navy Journal of Underwater Acoustics, January 2014, p. 323. Use of the buoys spread to the U.S. West Coast as well because they were cheaper to set up and operate than a shore station. Radio acoustic ranging had limitations and drawbacks. Local peculiarities in the propagation of acoustic waves in the water column could degrade its accuracy, there were problems with maintaining hydrophone stations, and handling explosive charges posed a considerable danger to personnel and ships.hydro-international.com Theberge, Albert E., \\"First Developments of Electronic Navigation Systems,\\" 27 March 2009. On one occasion a Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps ensign on board the survey ship USC&GS; Hydrographer inserted a radio acoustic ranging bomb in the mouth of a shark and released the shark, only to watch in horror as it swam back to the ship and exploded next to Hydrographer‚Ä≤s hull; the explosion rocked the ship.history.noaa.gov \\"A Letter From the Front\\" Aboard Guide in 1927, tragedy almost struck when a petty officer handling a bomb lit its fuse and then fell when the ship lurched; he dropped the bomb, which rolled into a gutter. The petty officer fell again before finally reaching the bomb and heaving it overboard just in time; it exploded alongside the ship just as it hit the water. The concussion prompted half the crew to rush up from below decks to find out what had happened.history.noaa.gov \\"The First Year\\" As late as 1942, radio acoustic ranging remained important enough to the Coast and Geodetic Survey for it to devote just over 100 pages of its Hydrographic Manual to it. However, World War II, which by then had been raging for three years, gave impetus to the rapid development of purely radio-based navigation systems to assist bombers in finding their targets in darkness and bad weather. Such radio navigation systems were easier to maintain than hydrophone stations and did not require the handling of explosives and, as the new systems matured, the Coast and Geodetic Survey began to apply them to maritime navigation. Radio acoustic ranging appears not to have been used after 1944, and by 1946, Coast and Geodetic Survey ships had switched over to the new SHORAN electronic navigation technology to fix their positions. Legacy The first non-visual method of precise navigation in human history, and the first that could be used at any time of day or night and in any weather conditions, radio acoustic ranging was a major step forward in the development of modern navigation systems. Nicholas Heck revolutionized oceanic surveying through the use of radio electronic ranging to establish ship locations, one of his major contributions to oceanography. His work related to the technique also helped to develop underwater sound velocity tables allowing the establishment of \\"true depths\\" of up to using echo sounding.NOAA History: Profiles in Time ‚Äì C&GS; Biographies: Nicholas Hunter HeckArlington National Cemetery Website: Nicholas H.

Jayakumar and Produced By Thangam Cinemas. The film features Gautham Karthik and Nikki Galrani in the lead roles, while Balamurali Balu composes the film's music. Produced by Thangam Cinemas and released by Blue Ghost Pictures, the venture began production in November 2016.  Plot  The film opens up with Thalaivar (Ravi Mariya) and his assistant Idi (Namo Narayana). In order to win the election as Chief Minister, Thalaivar tells Idi about his plan to plant a bomb under the stage during the elections. The bomb is hidden in a bag that resembles the various other bags given by the ruling party. Idi assures Thalaivar that he can find the right men for the job. The scene then shows Ramya (Nikki Galrani), who begins collecting all of her personal items. She calls her boyfriend Hari (Gautham Karthik), but he does not pick up the phone. An irritated Ramya then calls Hari's best friend Kathir (Sathish). She tells Kathir to tell Hari to collect all of the memorabilia that Ramya gave him while they were dating and to come meet her. Kathir then goes to A to Z Funeral Services, where Hari works. The two then go to Hari's house to collect the clothes that Ramya gave him, including a pair of Angry Birds underwear. Hari puts all the items into a ruling party bag. He and Kathir then set off to the liquor store to get drunk before meeting Ramya. Meanwhile, Idi recruits Spike (Rajendran) and Kumaru (Karunakaran) to plant the bomb. Spike is the supposed brains of the duo, while Kumaru is the harder worker of the two. Thalaivar tells them that should the operation go sideways they should cut the red wire on the bomb, rendering it useless. He warns them not to touch the green wire or the bomb will explode immediately. Thalaivar gives Spike and Kumaru some money in advance. After they leave, Kumaru tells Spike that they should keep some money aside for their expenses but give the rest away to their families. An emotional Spike agrees. The scene then switches over to Ravi (Bala Saravanan). He observes a man getting thrown out of a shop for trying to pay with counterfeit money. He then tracks the man down and shows him how to properly exchange counterfeit money. The man takes Ravi to his boss, Cash. Cash then gives Ravi counterfeit money and asks him to exchange it for real money. After Ravi does so successfully, Cash gives Ravi 10 million counterfeit rupees in a ruling party bag and asks him to exchange this as well. Meanwhile, Kumaru visits Jalaja, a prostitute, along with the money he had supposedly given to his family. Unbeknownst to him, Spike also comes to visit Jalaja. Kumaru tries to hide from Spike, and hilarity ensues when he finds out that Jalaja has not only been sleeping with him and Spike but almost every man in the apartment complex. The scene then cuts to Ramya, who visits her friend (Gayatri Rema) to get back the shoes that Ramya had lent her. Ramya says that she does not want anything that reminds her of Hari, who gave her the shoes in the first place. Ramya rents out a room at Hara Hara Mahadevaki Resort, where she meets up with her friend. Her friend asks Ramya the story of how she and Hari met. Ramya initially refuses but blames God for her and Hari meeting. It is revealed through a flashback that Ramya and Hari met at the temple. Seeing that it is an auspicious day, Ramya bathes in the river near the temple. Hari is also bathing in the river as well. When he emerges from the river, two kids steal his towel. A naked Hari tries to make his way back to the river but is blocked by Ramya, who faints upon seeing Hari naked. Ramya runs away from the scene. Later that day, Ramya skips class to go out with her friends to the movies. Ramya sees her Head of Department from the College and tries to hide from him. She accidentally runs into the men's bathroom, where she comes across Hari again. She inadvertently sees his genitals. Hari then accuses her of stalking him and chases her out of the bathroom. Ramya runs out of the bathroom and is seen by the Head of Department. The Head of Department, mistaking her presence in the men's bathroom, bans her from attending her classes. Ramya decides to try to find Hari so that he can explain to the Head what actually happened. Ramya finds Hari urinating against a wall in the street and accidentally sees his genitals once more. An angry Hari yells at her until a nearby police officer stops the fight. After explaining both sides of the story, the police officer advises Ramya and Hari to reconcile. Hari then goes to the college and explains to the Head what actually happened. The Head of Department apologizes to both of them and allows Ramya to come back to class. A grateful Ramya gets Hari's number, and the two begin dating soon afterward. Meanwhile in the present day, Hari is driving to the liquor store. He picks up Spike, who is hitchhiking. After dropping off Spike, Hari accidentally picks up the bag with the bomb, and Spike accidentally takes the bag with the Angry Birds underwear. Meanwhile at Hara Hara Mahadevaki, Geetha and her husband look for their eight-year-old daughter Harini, who has gone missing. A stranger advises the two to call the police. Inspector Hameed takes up the case and promises to find their daughter. It is revealed that the stranger from before was the one who kidnapped Harini. He calls Geetha and demands ten million rupees. In the flashback, Ramya calls Hari over to her house after her family goes to Thirupathi.

Reception= Critical reception  Srivatsan of India Today wrote \\"Considering that it's projected as an adult comedy, Hara Hara Mahadevaki could be best described by the word 'masturbatory'. In a more literal sense, the film has many masturbation, cleavage and hand job jokes that leave you angry.\\" Suganth.M of The Times of India wrote \\"Hara Hara Mahadevaki does stand true to its claim of being an adult comedy film, in the sense that the comedy here involves a few double entendres and sight gags. But take those away, and the film feels no different from the mindless comedies that we have been seeing of late.\\" Anupama Subramaniam of Deccan Chronicle wrote \\"The movie has the basics needed for the genre: innuendos, ambiguity in the phrases, double entendres, and visual comedy that seems both fated and accidental. But these elements alone don‚Äôt make for a complete picture - mindless dialogues and run-of-the-mill content puts this in the same category as most other average Tamil comedies.\\" Ashameera Aiyappan of The Indian Express said \\"For a movie that has several comedians, Hara Hara Mahadevaki surprisingly fails with humour. The movie which was promoted as an adult comedy is liberally peppered with puns and innuendos.\\" References External links  * Category:Indian films Category:2017 films Category:2010s Tamil-language films Category:Indian sex comedy films Category:Indian nonlinear narrative films Category:2017 directorial debut films ","title":"Hara Hara Mahadevaki"},{"id":"52205591","text":"Chinese rice wine may refer to: * Mijiu, made from glutinous rice * Huangjiu, made from rice or other grains through a different process ","title":"Chinese rice wine"},{"id":"52205599","text":"Edem Atovor (born 10 April 1994) is a Ghanaian footballer who plays for Israeli club Maccabi Kishronot Hadera FC and the Ghana women's national team.Ghana - CAN f√©minin : La pr√©s√©lection - Afrik11.com  Career = Club  Atovor started her career in 2005 with the Ghatel Ladies in Cape Coast.Women‚Äôs U-20: Ghana 1-1 USA.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It presently houses a funeral home. Description and history The Houghton House stands south of St. Albans's central business district, on the west side of South Main Street opposite the Bellows Free Academy. It is a two-story wood-frame structure, with a low-pitch hip roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade is five bays wide and symmetrical, with a center entrance flanked by sidelight windows. Above the entrance is a Palladian window. The interior follows a Georgian central hall plan, with parlors on either side in the front, and a library and dining room to the rear. The original kitchen was located in an ell extending to the rear. The interior woodwork is mainly from the late 1820s, and is of high quality. The parlors feature particularly elaborate woodwork, with a pilastered fireplace mantel, and ropework and dentil moulding in the cornices. with The house was built about 1800 by John Curtis, and was acquired by Abel Houghton in 1828. Houghton was responsible for the later stylistic alterations to the interior, which are believed to have been executed by Henry Bridges, a local master carver. The house remained in the Houghton family until the late 20th century, and now serves as a funeral home.

The locations for shooting were chosen as the interiors of Bengal villages near Bolpur in Birbhum district and Piyali in South 24 Parganas. Manas started this film with fresh faces chosen by himself from the interiors of rural West Bengal. According to him, \\"I went to many schools in the villages of North and South 24 pargana districts to find the suitable faces for the film. I did not want to use any of the polished urban child as the main protagonists of this film. Noor and Aminul were found in such village schools and I groomed them keeping in my own house for months.\\" Almost everybody related to this film were on their first assignment for the big screen.

Medicine Hat was equipped with SA and LL minesweeping gear for the detection of acoustic and magnetic naval mines. Operational history The minesweeper was ordered as part of the 1940‚Äì1941 construction programme. The ship's keel was laid down on 10 January 1941 by Canadian Vickers Ltd at their yard in Montreal, Quebec. Named for a community in Alberta, Medicine Hat was launched on 25 June 1941. The ship was commissioned on 4 December 1941 at Montreal.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 183 After arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 13 December, the vessel was assigned to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) as a convoy escort in the Battle of the Atlantic. In June 1942, Medicine Hat transferred to Sydney Force, the patrol and escort force operating out of Sydney, Nova Scotia. During this period, Medicine Hat was one of the Bangor-class minesweepers assigned to take coastal convoys through the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the St. Lawrence River. The Battle of the St. Lawrence began in May 1942 and carried on through the summer. Medicine Hat escorted the first Quebec City-Sydney convoy, QS 1.Sarty, pp. 79, 91, 95 In January 1943, the minesweeper rejoined WLEF for six months, transferring to Halifax Force for patrol and local escort duties out of Halifax in June. Medicine Hat remained with Halifax Force until May 1944 with the exception of November‚ÄìDecember 1943. During that period, the minesweeper joined Newfoundland Force, the escort and patrol unit based in St. John's, Newfoundland. In May 1944, Medicine Hat shifted back to Sydney Force and remained with that unit until January 1945. That month the warship joined Newfoundland Force until the end of the European war. Following the end of hostilities in Europe, Medicine Hat performed miscellaneous duties along the Atlantic coast until paid off at Halifax on 6 November 1945. The vessel was laid up in Shelburne, Nova Scotia until 1946 when the minesweeper was placed in strategic reserve at Sorel, Quebec. Medicine Hat remained at Sorel until 1951 when the minesweeper was reacquired by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Korean War. The vessel was taken to Sydney, Nova Scotia and given the new hull number FSE 197 and re- designated a coastal escort.Blackman, p. 99 However, the ship never recommissioned and remained in reserve at Sydney until 29 November 1957 when Medicine Hat was formally transferred to the Turkish Navy.

In 1859, her volume, \\"Idealities\\" (Philadelphia), appeared, and this was her first work in book form. Thereafter, she found time to write upon a great variety of subjects. She made several translations from the French, Spanish and Italian languages, notably Charles Forbes Ren√© de Montalembert's brochure, \\"Pius IX.,\\" the abstruse philosophical work of Juan Donoso Cort√©s from the Spanish, and the monograph of Adolphe de Chambrun on \\"The Executive Power\\" (Lancaster, Pennsylvania, 1874). These translations brought her complimentary recognitions, among others, a flattering letter from Montalembert. She was the author of a voluminous \\"Biography of Admiral Dahlgren,\\" and a number of novels including \\"South-Mountain Magic\\" (Boston, 1882), \\"A Washington Winter\\" (Boston, 1883), \\"The Lost Name ' Boston, 1886), \\"Lights and Shadows of a Life\\" (Boston 1887), \\"Divorced\\" (New York City, 1887), \\"South Sea Sketches\\" (Boston), and a volume on \\"Etiquette of Social Life in Washington\\" (Philadelphia, 1881), \\"Thoughts on Female Suffrage (Washton, 1871), and also of a great number of essays, articles, reviews and short stories written for papers and periodicals. Occasionally, Dahlgren expressed herself in verse, and several of her efforts ave found a place in anthologies of poets. Dahlgren's estate was on South Mountain, Maryland, overlooking the battlefield. In 1870 and 1873, she actively opposed the movement for female suffrage, and drew up a petition to Congress, which was extensively signed, asking that the right to vote should not be extended to women. The Literary Society of Washington, of which she was one of the founders, held its meetings in her house for six years, and she was elected its vice-president. She was for some time president of the Ladies' Catholic Missionary Society of Washington, and built the chapel of St. Joseph's of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, on South Mountain. Early years Sarah Madeleine Vinton was born in Gallipolis, Ohio on July 13, 1825. She was the only daughter of Samuel Finley Vinton, who served a quarter of a century with much distinction as a Whig leader in Congress, and Romaine Madeleine Bureau. Her mother and brother died when she was six. Dahlgren studied at Charles and Marie Picot's boarding school in Philadelphia and the Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School. Her maternal ancestors were French.Leonard O.S.U., Seraphine. Immortelles of Catholic Columbian Literature, D. H. McBride, 1897, p. 73 As soon as she was of age, Dahlgren served as hostess at her father's home in Washington, D.C. Career As early as 1859, Dahlgren contributed to the press prose articles under the signature \\"Corinne,\\" and later, some fugitive poems. She also wrote under the pen-name \\"Cornelia\\". In 1859, her volume, \\"Idealities,\\" appeared. She made several translations from the French, Spanish and Italian languages, which brought her recognition, among others, an autograph letter from Pope Pius IX, the thanks from the Queen of Spain and a complimentary notice from President James A. Garfield. Her works include the Biography of Admiral Dahlgren and a number of novels, among which are South Mountain Magic A Washington Winter, The Lost Name, Lights and Shadows of a Life, and South Sea Sketches, and a volume on Etiquette of Social Life in Washington. Social questions and the topics of the day especially occupied her attention. Her poems found a place in the anthologies of poets.

The bureau developed recipes, collected information from the burgeoning scientific practice of nutrition, published sewing patterns for homemade clothing, produced radio content like the Aunt Sammy personality, wrote articles for newspapers and magazines, and generally contributed to the adoption of scientific practices in routine household activities. Operating between 1923 and 1962, the bureau supported homemakers through the Great Depression and World War II.  History and leadership  Louise Stanley was the first head of the USDA Bureau of Home Economics when she was appointed in 1923. The bureau has its roots in the Office of Home Economics at the USDA. Established in 1915, the office centralized USDA existing efforts around cooking and nutrition and other home economics topics, and was tasked with disseminating \\"practical applications of research knowledge\\" from the USDA. World War I had redirected many essential foods to the war front, so the government guided homemakers on shopping for and cooking alternative foods. Following the war, the office was promoted to a bureau of seven employees in 1923 and placed under the leadership of Louise Stanley, PhD, a professor of home economics with degrees from Peabody College, Columbia University, and Yale University. Its efforts were focused in three areas which formed its major departments: Clothing and Textiles, Economics of the Home, and Food and Nutrition.  Economics of the Home  Among the projects in the Economics of the Home department, modern kitchen design and efficiency figured prominently. Since the early 1920s, the USDA studied how homemakers moved through their days and spent their time by equipping women with pedometers and having them keep time- use diaries. The Bureau continued the studies, examining \\"various household tasks including cooking, washing, and child care\\". These studies produced publications like Convenient Kitchens, a detailed bulletin with specifics about kitchen layout, work surfaces, equipment and food storage, ventilation, and lighting.  Food and nutrition  With its roots reaching back to home- front conservation during World War I, the bureau was positioned to tackle the strains of the Great Depression early in its history. Publications targeted families struggling to shop and cook with little or no money. Adequate Diets for People of Limited Income, Diets at Four Levels of Nutritive Content, Diets to Fit the Family Income and similar bulletins provided strategies and recipes to sustain a family on a short budget using cheaper ingredients that were as nutritious as more expensive ones. The bureau tracked and disseminated information from the developing science of nutrition. Scientists were discovering and classifying nutrients like Vitamins A, B and C, and the bureau created recipes to diversify diets. The bureau's charismatic vehicle for this knowledge was Aunt Sammy. A domestic, homemaking counterpart to Uncle Sam, Aunt Sammy was the front face of many of the bureau's extension efforts. Aunt Sammy hosted Housekeepers' Chat, a program sent to local radio stations nationwide to be read by local women. These recipes were later collected into Radio Recipes in order \\"to meet the enormous demand for printed copies of the most popular recipes broadcast from October, 1926, to June, 1927.\\"  References  Category:United States Department of Agriculture agencies Category:1923 establishments in the United States Category:1962 disestablishments in the United States ","title":"Bureau of Home Economics (US)"},{"id":"52206412","text":"Journey is a Thoroughbred racehorse best known for winning the British Champions Fillies' and Mares' Stakes at Ascot on British Champions Day.

It protects a region of dense rainforest, cerrado fields and flooded riparian zones that is rich in biodiversity. Formerly it was used for rubber extraction, and later efforts were made to develop a pulp industry. Extraction of timber for sale is now prohibited. The residents, who are poorly educated and suffer poor health, engage in subsistence hunting, fishing and farming, and extract forest products such as Brazil nuts, a√ßa√≠ palm fruit and heart of palm. Location The Rio Cajari Extractive Reserve is divided between the municipalities of Mazag√£o (44.44%), Vit√≥ria do Jari (16.88%) and Laranjal do Jari (38.67%) in Amap√°. It has an area of . The Cajari River, which gives its name to the reserve, drains the center of the reserve. The Amazon River forms the southeast boundary of the reserve, and the Ajuruxi River defines the northeastern boundary. Highway BR-156 runs through the northern part of the reserve, connecting the town of Laranjal do Jari on the Jari River to the west of the reserve with the state capital of Macap√° to the east. The Rio Iratapuru Sustainable Development Reserve and the Jari Ecological Station are a few kilometers to the north of the reserve. History In the mid-20th century the area now covered by the reserve was used for rubber extraction. Rubber tappers drawn to the area also learned to extract natural products. Later it became the property of the American millionaire Daniel K. Ludwig, founder of Jari project, which aimed to develop forestry, agriculture and mining. This involved deforestation of large areas and planting exotic species as sources of cellulose. A group of Brazilian businessmen with government backing took over the Jari project in 1981, but faced many problems including low soil fertility, erosion, failure of the exotic species to adapt to the climate, pests and diseases. There were conflicts with the traditional extractive population, who organized into what became a cooperative association. In 1985 the Rural Workers Union of Macapa joined the struggle for the creation of protected areas for rubber tappers, and the concept began to be accepted by the government. The Rio Cajari Extractive Reserve was created by federal decree 99.145 of 12 March 1990. A decree of 30 September 1997 declared that the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) could expropriate an area of about covered by the reserve. The reserve is classed as IUCN protected area category VI (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources). The reserve is to ensure sustainable use and conservation of renewable natural resources used by the traditional extractive populations. IBAMA was made responsible for management. Today the reserve is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). The reserve was made part of the Amap√° Biodiversity Corridor, created in 2003. On 3 June 2003 the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) recognized the reserve as supporting 700 families. This was revised to 900 families on 24 August 2005 and to 1,500 families on 22 August 2006. The deliberative council was created on 7 February 2006. On 27 May 2015 the beneficiary profile of the reserve's families was approved. Environment Average annual rainfall is . The highest rainfall is in February‚ÄìApril, and the least is in September‚ÄìDecember. Average daily temperatures range from with an average of . Altitudes range from . Elevations are mostly below in the lower Cajari region, and in the upper Cajari, with the highest land in the northwest of the reserve. Soils are mainly oxisols but there are areas of gleysol and other soil types. The area is near the mouth of the Amazon and is therefore subject to tidal flooding, which deposits sediments in the lower areas. The reserve is drained by the Cajari and Ajuruxi rivers, and other smaller streams, all flowing into the Amazon. The upper and middle courses of the Cajari form flooded terraces. In the lower course the river merges with other water bodies, which form meanders, lakes and channels. The reserve is in the Guiana Shield region, a center of endemism. The characteristic dense rainforest has many Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa) and a√ßa√≠ palms (Euterpe oleracea). Migratory birds include fork-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus savana), great-billed hermit (Phaethornis malaris) and red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus). A quick survey near the Marinho community in the upper Cajari region recorded 15 species of non-flying mammals, 26 of flying mammals, 155 of birds, 13 of amphibians and 28 of reptiles. This almost certainly understates the true biodiversity. Another study in 2006 found 118 taxa of amphibians and reptiles. The dense forest ecosystem is home to tapirs, agoutis, sloths, coati, monkeys and cats. Reptiles, small rodents and herbivorous mammals live in the cerrado fields ecosystems. The riparian ecosystems have a more abundant fauna including alligators, turtles, otters, giant otters, capybaras, tapir and paca, plentiful birds such as ducks, egrets, herons, kingfisher and many varieties of fish. Bird species include great-billed hermit, black-headed antbird (Percnostola rufifrons) and ferruginous-backed antbird (Myrmeciza ferruginea). Herpetofauna include Leposoma guianense, Atelopus spumarius, Arthrosaura kockii and Iphisa elegans. The frog species Pristimantis chiastonotus is endemic to Amap√°. Economy Data from 1993 showed high infant mortality and lack of sanitation and clean water supplies. 60% of the population suffer from worms and 48% from respiratory diseases. 78% use home treatments for diseases. As of 2004 about 52% of the population was illiterate and only 10% had more than primary education. There were 19 schools, but these were not enough to meet the needs of the dispersed population and were in poor condition. There were nine rudimentary health care centers. The main agricultural products are corn, beans, rice, pineapple, cassava, yams and sweet potatoes. Rubber is being phased out, and the main non-timber extractive products are now Brazil nuts and a√ßa√≠ hearts of palm and fruit. The residents fish for subsistence and for barter with trading boats to purchase manufactured goods. The residents practice subsistence hunting of birds of the Galliformes and Tinamiformes orders, and mammals such as peccary, paca, agouti and monkey. There is irregular hunting by residents and poachers from Macap√°, Santana and Laranjal do Jari. Under the reserve's usage plan, timber should be extracted only for housing and other communities buildings.

It is a left bank tributary of the Yenisey. The name of the river Kem comes from the ancient word \\"kem\\" or \\"hem\\" that has a meaning of \\"great river\\". This toponymy is very popular and widespread from Siberia up to Karelia and Finland. Course The river flows across the West Siberian Plain through the districts of Bolshemurtinsky, Kazachinsky, Pirovsky, and Yeniseysky District before discharging into the Yenisei River close to the town of Yeniseysk at 2045 kilometers before the mouth. The Kem is 356 kilometres (221 miles) long. Its drainage basin covers a total area of 8,940 square kilometres (3,452 square miles). The most important tributaries of the Kem are the Tyya () at the 97 kilometer from the mouth and the Belaya () at the 115 kilometer from the mouth. Both major tributaries are on the left side. The source of the Kem is located in Bolshemurtinsky District where it rises as a small creek in the East Siberian taiga. Due to the tributary rivers, towards the mouth river reaches 45 meters of width. The Kem flows mostly through the plain and vegetation grows directly up to the river shores and water. The bottom of the river is covered with a lot of clay and sandy-clay and a river water is generally not clear. The upper reaches of the river flows through the mixed type taiga covered with conifers (larch, fir, spruce, cedar), birch and aspen, as well as through the areas that are categorized as a standard mixed forest. Due to the tributary rivers, towards the mouth the river reaches 45 meters of width. Protected area Kem's Biological Reserve is located on the 16 000 hectares of the land that stretched along the banks of the river.

Swift Current was equipped with SA and LL minesweeping gear for the detection of acoustic and magnetic naval mines. Operational history The minesweeper was ordered as part of the 1940‚Äì1941 construction programme. The ship's keel was laid down on 10 January 1941 by Canadian Vickers Ltd at their yard in Montreal, Quebec. Named for a community in Saskatchewan, Swift Current was launched on 29 May 1941. The ship was commissioned on 11 November 1941 at Montreal.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 184 Arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia on 24 November, the vessel was used as an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) training ship there until May 1942. That month, Swift Current sailed to Pictou, Nova Scotia to resume ASW training duties there. In February 1943, the minesweeper was sent back to Halifax to join Halifax Force, the patrol and escort unit based there. She remained as part of that unit until June when Swift Current joined Gasp√© Force as a convoy escort in the Battle of the St. Lawrence. In September 1943, Swift Current was among the warships deployed as part of the Canadian force to break up Operation Kiebitz, the German plan to breakout prisoner of war U-boat captains from a camp in Canada.Sarty, p. 251 Swift Current was among those sent to intercept the U-boat as it entered Chaleur Bay to rescue the prisoners. The submarine sighted the warships before entering the harbour and broke off the attempt before it could be intercepted.Douglas et al., A Blue Water Navy, p. 96 In November 1943, the minesweeper returned to Halifax Force and remained with the unit until undergoing a refit at Lunenburg, Nova Scotia in February 1944. Following the completion of the refit, Swift Current was transferred to Newfoundland Force, the patrol and escort force based in St. John's, Newfoundland and remained with that group until June 1945. From June until October, the warship performed miscellaneous duties along the Atlantic coast of Canada.

He was one of the founders of the Econometric Society together with American economist Irving Fisher and Norwegian economist Ragnar Frisch in 1930. He served as Secretary- Treasurer during the first year of the Society and was elected as President in 1948. He was director of research of the Cowles Commission from September 1934 to January 1937.Charles F. Roos (1901-1958) Roos earned a PhD in mathematics from Rice University in 1926, under supervision of Griffith C. Evans. He was amongst the first, together with Evans and mathematician Frank P. Ramsey, to use the calculus of variations in mathematical economics. His direct involvement with two key institutions in economic history, both the Econometric Society and the Cowles Commission, place him in a pivotal position in the mathematization of economics in the first half of the 20th century. His own work, however, would not be so influential. Mathematical economics and econometrics eventually favored technical and epistemological approaches that were different from his own.  Biography  Charles Frederick Roos was born in New Orleans, Louisiana on 18 May 1901. He studied mathematics at the Rice Institute, receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1921, his Master of Arts degree in 1924, and, being awarded his PhD in 1926. His main interests were in the calculus of variations, integral equations, and the applications of these to economic theory. His early research was deeply inspired by the work of his thesis advisor Griffith C. Evans who used these same mathematical tools to analyze business cycles, economic equilibrium, and economic competition. During the following years, from 1926 to 1928, Roos continued his academic studies as National Research Fellow at the University of Chicago and Princeton University. At Princeton, Roos met the Norwegian economist Ragnar Frisch who was travelling there under a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. They shared a common sentiment that economics should be brought closer to mathematics and to statistics (this would later become known as econometrics) and decided to request support from American economist Irving Fisher, at Yale University, to help organize an association to research such topics. Later that year, both Frisch and Roos met with Fisher to discuss the formation of what would become the Econometric Society. In 1930 the Econometric Society was founded; Frisch was elected to be its first president, and Roos its secretary- treasurer. During this period, Roos had also been serving as secretary for the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) where he oversaw Section K of economics, sociology and statistics. This position also allowed him to bring together subjects of his interest such as the applications of statistics to the social sciences, and also to invite fellow members of the Econometric Society to lecture and present research on such topics. Following his National Research Fellowship Roos was hired as assistant professor of mathematics at Cornell University. He resigned this position in 1931 to assume a position as permanent secretary at the AAAS where he arranged programs in economics. In the wake of the Great Depression Roos organized a symposium on unemployment; the papers presented at this meeting were later published by the AAAS in a book entitled Stabilization of Employment. In 1933 Roos resigns from the AAAS to study mathematical economics in England under a G√ºggenheim fellowship. He quickly declines this fellowship, however, as he was called to be principal economist and director of research of the newly created National Recovery Administration (NRA). Roos' work during the short period he served as director of the NRA was later published by the Principia Press in 1937. Only a couple years later, in May 1935, the Supreme Court ruled that the NRA was unconstitutional and the organization was dissolved. Already in 1934 Alfred Cowles approached Roos about a position to be professor of econometrics at Colorado College and director of research in the newly founded Cowles Commission for Economic Research based in Colorado Springs. Cowles was no stranger to Roos as the latter had previously reached out to him and Fisher with interests in researching forecasting methods. Following the stock market crash in 1929, Cowles realized his own forecasting techniques were mostly guesswork and endeavored to seriously research the subject. Through a common acquaintance, he met American mathematician Harold T. Davis, a professor at Indiana University who recommended that he look into the Econometric Society. Cowles contacted Frisch and Roos and decided to fully fund both the Econometric Society and its journal Econometrica. Roos accepted Cowles' offer to come to Colorado. Besides being the Commission's director he also wrote the first Cowles Monograph entitled Dynamic Economics: Theoretical and Statistical Studies of Demand, Production and Prices. This work was a summary of much his previous research and academic work in dynamic economics and explored many business applications such as in the demand for gasoline, agricultural products, and residential building. The Cowles Commission would later become an important institution in mathematical economics specially associated with Walrasian general-equilibrium theory and general-equilibrium models. Many nobel laureates in economics were associated with the Commission and/or wrote a Cowles Monograph. Some examples include Kenneth Arrow (social choice), Gerard Debreu (general equilibrium), Tjalling Koopmans (activity analysis, linear programming), Lawrence Klein (economic fluctuations), and Harry Markowitz (portfolio selection). The second Cowles Monograph was also written by Roos based on his work at the NRA. Roos' business interests lead him to New York in 1937, where, a couple years later, he founded the Institute for Applied Econometrics (later renamed to Econometric Institute). The firm worked with big businesses such as General Motors and offered broad forecasting services. Roos' work with automobile industry resulted in the book The Dynamics of Automobile Demand, published in 1939. He would work as director of the Econometric Institute until his death on January 7, 1956. While the latter part of Roos' career saw a decline in his academic publications he still found ways to keep himself active and even published in a survey article in Econometrica in 1955.  Mathematical economics  Charles Roos was one of the first to employ the calculus of variations to economic theory. His work follows closely that of his PhD advisor Griffith Evans and is partly inspired by the works of Vilfredo Pareto, L√©on Walras, and Cournot. His main interest was to develop a dynamic theory of economics and he most commonly framed his analysis as a profit maximization problem solved by a firm. Solving this by means of differential calculus determines the optimal amount of production in a given instant of time. Roos' approach, on the other hand, allowed one to determine the optimal amounts of production during an interval of time, allowing for prices to change during this period. His 1925 article A Mathematical Theory of Competition explores this situation under the hypothesis of monopoly and that of a large number of individual producers. In his later work he extends this to a general-equilibrium framework by considering how producers and consumers would converge to market equilibrium over a given interval of time. Most of these contributions were summarized in the first Cowles Monograph Dynamic Economics: Theoretical and Statistical Studies of Demand, Production and Prices published in 1934.

It was originally created by Google as a competitor to Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News. AMP is optimized for mobile web browsing and intended to help webpages load faster. AMP pages may be cached by a CDN, such as Microsoft Bing or Cloudflare's AMP caches, which allows pages to be served more quickly. AMP was first announced on October 7, 2015. After a technical preview period, AMP pages began appearing in Google mobile search results in February 2016. AMP was initially criticized for potentially giving further control over the web to Google. The AMP Project announced it would move to an open governance model on September 18, 2018.  History = Announcement and launch  The AMP Project was announced by Google on October 7, 2015, following discussions with its partners in the Digital News Initiative (DNI), and other news publishers and technology companies around the world, about improving the performance of the mobile web. More than 30 news publishers and several technology companies (including Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn and WordPress) were initially announced as collaborators in the AMP Project. AMP pages first appeared to web users in February 2016, when Google began to show the AMP versions of webpages in mobile search results. Initially links to AMP pages were restricted to a ‚ÄúTop Stories‚Äù section of Google's mobile search results; by September 2016 Google started linking to AMP content in the main mobile search results area. AMP links in Google search are identified with an icon. According to one of the co-founders of the AMP Project, Malte Ubl, AMP was originally called PCU, which stood for Portable Content Unit.  Growth and expansion  In September 2016, Microsoft announced support for AMP in the Bing apps for iOS and Android. In February 2017, a year after the public launch of AMP, Adobe reported AMP pages accounted for 7% of all web traffic for top publishers in the United States. In May 2017, Google reported 900,000 web domains were publishing AMP pages with more than two billion AMP pages published globally. In June 2017, Twitter started linking to AMP pages from its iOS and Android apps. In September 2018, Microsoft began rolling out its own Bing AMP viewer and AMP cache. On December 7, 2018, AMP announced their official WordPress plugin, which allowed WordPress websites to include AMP-ready pages. As announced by AMP's tech lead Malte at AMP Conf '19, AMP is now just AMP, and does not stand for Accelerated Mobile Pages anymore.  AMP Framework = AMP HTML  The AMP framework consists of three components: AMP HTML, which is standard HTML markup with web components; AMP JavaScript, which manages resource loading; and AMP caches, which serve and validate AMP pages. Most AMP pages are delivered by Google's AMP cache, but other companies can support AMP caches. Internet performance and security company Cloudflare launched an AMP cache in March 2017.  Web Stories  Web Stories, known as AMP Stories until April 2020, were introduced in 2018. Web stories are a visually tappable experience that provides content publishers with a mobile-focused format for delivering news and information as visually rich, tap-through stories. In 2019, Google announced that they would roll out new dedicated placement on the SERP for Web Stories, starting with the travel category first. On April 17, 2019 at their AMP Conference in Tokyo, they also announced ads and Google Analytics integration, and option to embed new types of content ‚Äî specifically Twitter posts, Google Maps, and YouTube videos, to be rolled out later in 2019.  Web Stories Editors and Builders  Since Google launched the Web Story format, there have been a number of new SaaS that offer fast, no-code options to create Web Stories. These tools are fit for content publishers who want to exploit the new technology but do not know how to code, or who wish to publish content in an accelerated manner without manually defining styling and layout.  AMP Email  In 2019, Google announced the new AMP Email section of the AMP framework. AMP for email allows senders to include AMP components inside rich engaging emails, making modern app functionality available within email. The AMP email format provides a subset of AMP HTML components for use in email messages, allowing recipients of AMP emails to interact dynamically with content directly in the message.  Technology = Online format  AMP pages are published on-line and can be displayed in most current browsers. When a standard webpage has an AMP counterpart, a link to the AMP page is usually placed in an HTML tag in the source code of the standard page. Because most AMP pages are easily discoverable by web crawlers, third parties such as search engines and other referring websites can choose to link to the AMP version of a webpage instead of the standard version.  Third-party integration  Any organization or individual can build products or features which will work on AMP pages, provided they comply with the AMP Project specifications. As of July 2017, the AMP Project's website listed around 120 advertising companies and around 30 analytics companies as AMP Project participants.  Performance  Google reports that AMP pages served in Google search typically load in less than one second and use ten times less data than the equivalent non-AMP pages. CNBC reported a 75% decrease in mobile page load time for AMP Pages over non-AMP pages, while Gizmodo reported that AMP pages loaded three times faster than non-AMP pages. An academic paper about AMP reveals that AMP pages' page load time is 2.5 times faster than non- AMP versions without pre-rendering in Google's search result page, and the AMP version is approximately nine times faster than the non-AMP version with the pre-rendering.  Parity with canonical pages  Google has announced that as of February 1, 2018, it will require the content of canonical pages and those displayed through AMP be substantially the same. This is aimed at improving the experience of users by avoiding common difficulties with the user interface, and increase security and trust (see below).  Reception = General criticism  AMP has been widely criticized by many in the tech industry for being an attempt by Google to exert its dominance on the Web by dictating how websites are built and monetized, and that \\"AMP is Google's attempt to lock publishers into its ecosystem\\". AMP has also been linked to Google's attempt to deprecate URLs so that users will not be able to immediately see whether they are viewing a webpage on the open Web or an AMP page that is hosted on Google's servers. Joshua Benton, director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University, said: \\"there is a sense in which AMP is a Google-built version of the web. We are moving from a world where you can put anything on your website to one where you can‚Äôt because Google says so.\\" Ramon Tremosa, a Spanish member of the European Parliament, said: \\"AMP is an example of Google dialing up its anti-competitive practices under the nose of the competition regulators.\\"  Comparison to other formats  AMP is often compared to Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News. All three formats were announced in 2015 with the stated goal of making mobile content faster and easier to consume. AMP Project supporters claim that AMP is a collaborative effort among publishers and technology companies, and that AMP is designed to work on the web instead of proprietary mobile apps. Google's Richard Gingras said: > \\"There's a very big difference between having a proprietary platform that > says it's open, and having an open-source platform that is open to anyone to > modify and adapt. It's the difference between saying come into my walled > garden vs. not having a walled garden.\\" However, some critics believe that AMP is an impending walled garden as Google begins to host AMP-restricted versions of their websites directly on google.com: > They say AMP is not actually supporting the open web because it is a \\"fork\\" > or variation on HTML and one that Google essentially controls...Some > publishers have complained that as Google prioritizes AMP links‚Äîas it > recently said it will do in mobile search‚Äîmedia companies will lose even > more control because AMP pages are hosted and controlled by Google. \\"Our > mobile search traffic is moving to be majority AMP (Google hosted and not on > our site) which limits our control over UI, monetization et al,\\" said one > digital media executive, quoted in a Fortune article.  Google control  Matthew Ingram of Fortune expressed concerns about Google's role and motives regarding the AMP Project: > \\"In a nutshell, these publishers are afraid that while the AMP project is > nominally open-source, Google is using it to shape how the mobile web works, > and in particular, to ensure a steady stream of advertising revenue‚Ä¶ More > than anything else, the concerns that some publishers have about AMP seems > to be part of a broader fear about the loss of control over distribution in > a platform-centric world, and the risks that this poses to traditional > monetization methods such as display advertising.\\" These charges were rebutted by Google. Madhav Chinnappa stated that AMP must be a collaborative industry initiative in order for it to succeed in the long term: > \\"I get a little bit irritated when sometimes people call it Google's AMP, > because it's not ‚Ä¶ AMP was created as an open source initiative and that for > me is the reason for its success.\\" In September 2018, Google began to transition AMP to a more open governance model, with a technical steering committee composed of AMP-using publishers.  Problems on pre-rendering  AMP's instantaneous webpage access speed is partly from its pre-rendering in Google's search result page. This pre- rendering is out of the user's control but can fetch an unwanted page. > \\"AMP prefetching and pre-rendering results in some additional data (and > power) use with each search. The average 1.4 MB of additional data per > search that is used for pre-rendering an AMP page that the user may not > visit is not trivial overhead for certain users with limited data plans.\\" Furthermore, this can be a privacy issue, since the unwanted downloaded data will be logged even though the user does not choose to download it.  Monetization  Some publishers reported that AMP pages generate less advertising revenue per page than non-AMP pages. The Wall Street Journals Jack Marshall said: > \\"AMP pages rely heavily on standardized banner ad units, and don't allow > publishers to sell highly-customized ad units, sponsorships or pop-up ads as > they might on their own properties\\" Other publishers have reported better success with AMP monetization. The Washington Post has been able to generate approximately the same amount of revenue from AMP pages as from standard mobile pages, according to director of product Joey Marburger. CNN chief product officer Alex Wellen said AMP Pages \\"largely monetize at the same rate\\" as standard mobile pages. To improve advertising performance, the AMP Project launched the AMP Ads Initiative which includes support for more advertising formats and optimizations to improve ad load speed.  Exploitation for malicious purposes  Some observers believe AMP allows more effective phishing attempts. One serious flaw, noted by tech writer Kyle Chayka, is that disreputable parties who misuse AMP (as well as Facebook's similar Instant Articles) enable junk websites to share many of the same visual cues and features found on legitimate sites. \\"All publishers end up looking more similar than different. That makes separating the real from the fake even harder,\\" said Chayka. In September 2017, Russian hackers used an AMP vulnerability in phishing e-mails sent to investigative journalists critical of the Russian government, and hacked into their websites. Google announced on November 16, 2017 that it will stop allowing sites using AMP for formatting to bait-and-switch sites. Google said beginning February 2018, AMP pages must contain content nearly identical to that of the standard page they're replicating.

Early life  Hugo Duncan Dixon was born in December 1963 to the Conservative MP Piers Dixon and the artist Edwina Sandys. The couple divorced in 1970 when Dixon was six. Dixon has an older brother, Mark Pierson Dixon, born in 1962.  Education  Dixon was a King's Scholar at Eton and gained a first in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Balliol College, Oxford.  Career  Dixon's first job was as an intern at The Economist in 1985, a year later he became junior banking correspondent for the Financial Times (FT). In 1988, aged 24, he was seconded to work for the then Social Democratic Party (SDP) leader Bob Maclennan to write the manifesto for the party's merger with the Liberals. Voices and Choices For All became known as 'the dead parrot document' after the famous Monty Python sketch because, when Liberal MPs read about its proposals in this paper, they barricaded their leader David Steel into his Commons office and told him he would be turfed out if he backed the controversial document ‚Äì copies of which had already been left for journalists waiting at the press conference to announce the merger. Dixon also began working as telecoms and electronics correspondent for the FT in the same year. In 1993 Dixon became leader writer for the FT and a year later became editor of the paper's Lex column.  Breakingviews  Inspired by an interview with Bill Gates in 1999 Dixon quit his job at the FT and co-founded Breakingviews, with his colleague from the FT, Jonathan Ford, a website providing financial commentary. In 2007 Dixon and Ford fell out and Ford left to help set up a rival financial commentary website at Reuters. In 2009 Dixon sold Breakingviews to Reuters for ¬£13 million, making himself ¬£2.5 million, with a retention bonus for Dixon to stay on as the website's editor for the following three years. The move meant that Ford lost his position at Reuters. Dixon continued as Breakingviews editor until 2012 when he became its editor-at-large, he still writes a fortnightly column for the website.

Built in 1915 by a local bakery, it was acquired and enlarged by the National Biscuit Company (now better known as Nabisco), which operated here until 1969. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 for its economic and commercial historic significance, and has since then been converted into residences. Description and history The former Moquin's Bakery building stands in a predominantly residential area of Burlington's Old North End, on the east side of Rose Street between Cedar Street and Manhattan Drive. It is a large two-story brick building, with single-story extensions on both sides. The main facade is seven bays wide, with the central section having three bays articulated by brick pilasters. The outermost bays consist of paired sash windows, set in segmented-arch openings, above which is a band of brick corbelling. Although it is basically symmetrical, the building has a complex construction history, beginning as a single-story two-bay structure in the center of the structure. with The oldest portion of the building was erected in 1915 by John and Julius Moquin, and by the 1920s had grown to be a major local economic presence, delivering bread and other bakery products across the state. The Moquin's withdrew from the business in the 1930s, and it eventually merged with the National Biscuit Company. The plant was substantially enlarged about 1940, and had by 1945 achieved most of its present size and scale. It was closed in 1969, and was used for a time as a warehouse before a brief reuse as a bakery in 1982. It has since been adaptively repurposed into residences.
