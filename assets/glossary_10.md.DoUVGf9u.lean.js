It lies in an isolated position on the Steart Peninsula on the Bristol Channel coast, about north of Bridgwater. The toponym is derived from the Old English steort, meaning \\"tail, projecting piece of land\\". Steart was historically in the ancient parish of Stockland Bristol, except for the foreshore on the Bristol Channel coast, which was in the parish of Stogursey. In 1885 it was transferred to the civil parish of Otterhampton.Vision of Britain website A medieval chapel at Steart was disused by 1611. The church of St Andrew was built in 1882. The Bethel Congregational church was open between 1847 and 1938. During World War 2, two small radio direction-finding stations were located in Steart. They were part of a secret MI6 organisation called The Radio Security Service listening to and locating the communications of German spies and their handlers. These stations intercepted the messages of the Abwehr, the German Secret Intelligence Service, and provided a large volume of high level intelligence throughout the war. In December 1945, in the nearby village of Combwich The Freedom of Steart was conferred upon Captain Louis Varney, the officer in command of the DF Stations.

Species are parasitic on other fungi and do not produce distinct basidiocarps (fruit bodies). The genus is the teleomorphic (sexual) state of the yeast genus Cryptococcus, some species of which are human pathogens.  History  The genus was first described in 1975 from the United States by K.J. Kwon-Chung, who obtained cultures of the type species, Filobasidiella neoformans, by crossing strains of the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans. She was able to observe basidia similar to those of the genus Filobasidium, hence the name Filobasidiella for the new genus. Based on the shape and structure of the basidia, the genus was initially assigned to the order Filobasidiales. Cladistic analysis of DNA sequences, however, later showed that Filobasidiella belonged within the Tremellales, with the genus Kwoniella (with Tremella-like basidia) as a sister clade.  Description  Filobasidiella species are not known to produce distinct, visible fruitbodies. Microscopically, the hyphae are colourless, are clamped or unclamped, and bear haustorial cells with filaments that attach to the hyphae of the host fungus. The basidia are club- shaped and highly elongated. Spores arise in succession from four loci at the apex (which is sometimes partly septate). These spores are passively released and may remain on the basidium in chains, unless disturbed. In the type species, the spores germinate to form yeast cells, but yeast states are not known for all species.  Habitat, distribution and species  Cryptococcus neoformans, the pathogenic yeast state of Filobasidiella neoformans Filobasidiella neoformans and F. bacillispora are known only from laboratory cultures of their respective yeast states (Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii). The presence of haustorial cells on their hyphae indicate that they are (or were) parasites of other fungi, but their original host species are unknown. Both yeasts are human pathogens, responsible for cryptococcosis, and are now cosmopolitan in distribution. Filobasidiella depauperata (synonym F. arachnophila) is parasitic on Lecanicillium lecanii, an entomopathogenic fungus, and is known from Sri Lanka, England, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, and Canada. It is not known to produce a yeast state. Filobasidiella lutea is parasitic on Granulobasidium vellereum, a corticioid fungus, and is known from England and Italy. It too is not known to produce a yeast state. DNA sequencing suggests all four species are congeneric. A fifth species, Filobasidiella xianghuijun, has been reported from China in association with Tremella fuciformis, but its status is uncertain.

He was transferred to Royal Antwerp F.C. in 1975 but six months later, he sustained an injury in a UEFA Cup match against ≈ölƒÖsk Wroc≈Çaw that ended his career. Coaching career However, he did not stop his football career and began to work as a trainer. Beginning his career as a trainer of K.S.V. Roeselare in 1977, the following season he became trainer of Eendracht Aalst. K.V. Kortrijk was his next club in 1979 and after finishing second in Belgian Second Division his team promoted to First Division. In 1983, he moved to Cercle Brugge K.S.V.; however, Houwaart's aim was to become trainer of Club Brugge and one year later he moved there. He won his first trophies with this club, the Belgian Cup in 1986 and the Belgian Supercup the same year. He also won his first Championship as a coach in the 1987‚Äì88 season and the same season his team played in UEFA Cup and reached the semi-finals, when they were eliminated by RCD Espanyol in extra time. He was fired in 1989 after bad results and he returned to his former club K.V. Kortrijk. He then moved to Greece to be the coach of AO Xanthi. After one year in Greece, he returned to Belgium and returned for two years to Cercle Brugge until 1993. His next team was K.R.C. Harelbeke, and he helped them to promote to the first division. He stayed there six years, from 1994 until 2000. After six years coaching K.R.C. Harelbeke, he went to K.A.A. Gent, but few months after, he was fired after a home defeat of the team in UEFA Cup by AFC Ajax. For the second time in his career he left Belgium, this time he moved to Cyprus in November 2000 and became coach of Omonia Nicosia. Despite that Omonia was the most successful team in Cyprus, they had not won the Cypriot First Division in eight years. Omonia were seven points behind Anorthosis Famagusta, who were champions the previous four years and another year seemed lost for Omonia. After Houwaart's departure, Omonia performance changed rapidly and they won the championship after 8 years and a few months later they won the Cyprus Super Cup. After a bad beginning in the 2001‚Äì02 season, Houwaart quit as coach and went back to Belgium and to Royal Antwerp for the remaining season. He coached Sporting West Ingelmunster-Harelbeke in 2002‚Äì03. He moved to Cyprus again, this time for AEL Limassol during the middle of the season 2003‚Äì04. Since the day he began coaching AEL Limassol, his team was unbeaten and reached the Cypriot Cup final. The unbeaten record ended in that final against AEK Larnaca, when his team lost 2‚Äì1. Six months later, he returned to his first Cypriot team, AC Omonia and won the Cypriot Cup after beating Digenis Morphou in the final 2‚Äì0. A few months later, they won the Cyprus Super Cup again. In the Super Cup, Omonia beat Anorthosis Famagusta 5‚Äì4 on penal ties after a 2‚Äì2 result. The 2005‚Äì06, Omonia was contenter for the Championship title, however the team performed badly and he resigned again from Omonia.

In the episode, a man claims to have Gulf War Syndrome, while Cameron seduces Chase, and House has a urination disorder due to Vicodin. Plot The episodes opens with a US Marine Humvee being hit by an RPG in Iraq. One man drags out a Marine with a severed leg into a clearing and then the Marine is shown to be House. The whole scenario turns out to be House's dream, and when he wakes up, Cuddy presents him with a new case. House recognizes him as the man who dragged him out of the burning vehicle from the dream. House treats the man, whom Cuddy reveals to be the nephew of a hospital donor and a recently discharged Marine, who complains of Gulf War syndrome. The fact that House had a dream in his office just before being given the case that included this patient causes House to try to figure out how he could have possibly met this man before. House sends his team to investigate the patient's identity as well as his condition. During a polysomnogram, the patient is left alone in an observation room during which Cameron \\"seduces\\" Chase into having sex next door. Foreman casually comes in to check on the patient, who is overwhelmed by a foul odor, which turns out to be bacteria in his mouth. Foreman questions Cameron and Chase later about why they were absent. Cameron admits having sex with Chase, but Foreman takes it as a joke. Meanwhile, House ultimately relieves his urination problem by inserting a catheter in himself. Following this relief, he is able to sleep, leading him to have another dream. House wakes up and correctly diagnoses the patient with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, surprising the team. House finally recognizes the patient and approaches Cuddy for lying to him that the patient was the nephew of a hospital donor. House realizes where he met the patient before, one of Cuddy's dates, and confronts Cuddy who responds that House only remembered the man because he was Cuddy's date. Cuddy tells House to get over her. House catches Cameron and Chase in a storage closet while disposing some files, leaving both of them with shocked expressions on their faces at House's seemingly apathetic attitude to catching them.  Reception  * On March 28, 2007, Staci Krause from IGN claimed that the episode was very confusing, but entertaining throughout.

It is a multifaceted story that entails adventure, magic, schemes, beauty, love, ordeals of separation and above all romantic tragedy. The fame of the story is ascribed to Ganj or Shah Jo Risalo; the poetry book Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai wrote, which also included other stories like Umar Marui, Sohni Mehar, Sassui Punhun, Noori Jam Tamachi, Sorath Rai Diyach and Lilan Chanesar. The protagonists of these seven tales are women; hence, including Momal, all have remained cultural icons in Sindhi Literature and known as the Seven Heroines () of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai. Earlier, apart from Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, several other poets, like Shah Inat Rizvi, for instance, wrote verses on this tale and many others after Latif's demise, like Tajal Bewas and Shaikh Ayaz (to quote a few) tried upon the same tale; hence all broadened the perspective of the tale from different angles. Nonetheless, Momal-Rano is considered to be one of the most popular folktales in Sindhi and Rajasthani literature. The story also appears in Shah Jo Risalo and forms part of seven popular tragic romances from Sindh, Pakistan. The other six tales are Umar Marvi, Sassui Punnhun, Sohni Mehar, Lilan Chanesar, Noori Jam Tamachi and Sorath Rai Diyach commonly known as the Seven Queens of Sindh, or the Seven heroines of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai. Historical context The story is considered to have occurred in the geographical belts of Rajasthan, India as well as Sindh, Pakistan. The belt that covers the geography of Rajasthan in relation to the story is Lodrawa or Lodhruva in Jaisalmer district; while the area in Sindh is Momal Ji Maari (Momal's Mansion) and her father's house in Ghotki district of the province. The story occurred in the times of Hameer Soomro, the King of Umerkot or Amarkot (now a district in the south-east of Sindh province in Pakistan), possibly in the mid-14th century.Sindhi Abadi board Story The king of Amarkot, Hameer Soomoro, along with his ministers, Rano Mahendhra, Seenharro Dhamachanni and Daunro Bhatyanni, used to go for hunting in the far flung areas of Amarkot and sometimes could even cross the boundaries of their little country for the adventure. Once during a hunting spree, these four men were encountered by a person who came across them accidentally. They did not disclose to the fellow who they were and what they did. But the fellow engaged them in the story of what happened to him in the preceding days. He was a prince from the area near Kashmir, who had heard the legend of Momal's beauty and charm and got so inspired that he pursued the adventure, but when he approached the area where Momal lived, he was not only overpowered by her enchanting beauty but also the tricks and schemes played by her female servants/sisters, who not only robbed that prince of his wealth and material but also so confused him in multiple puzzles that he could do nothing else but save his life and run. The story told by this prince was sufficient to intrigue those four friends. They extracted information from the prince about Momal's whereabouts and decided to pursue the same adventure. The place where Momal lived was near Lodhruva, in the north-east of Umerkot. She lived with her seven (some historians say nine) sisters, the most famous of which being Somal and Natir, (some consider her to be Momal's servant rather than sister) in a palace called Kak Mahal (The Palace of Kak). It was a magical palace with labyrinths, puzzles, fake ponds, illusions and much more. It was a legend that anyone who wanted to be a suitor for Momal would undergo several obstacles, and the one who succeeded in reaching the palace unharmed would possibly be accepted as her consort. As the history suggested, almost everyone who approached Momal and her sisters/servants was robbed of everything including their lives excluding a few like the prince from Kashmir who told the stories of his devastation. Momal enjoyed legendary beauty. Somal was famous for intelligence; while Natir was known as a schemer. They worked collectively to enchant the suitors and overpower them. They could not let the suitors experience an easy task of puzzles they designed for them. As the luck would have it, Rano Mendhro, who was famously intelligent and brave, was the only person to successfully reach the palace, utterly unharmed. Momal was fairly impressed and that led him to be accepted as her consort. The King Hameer, along with other two ministers, left Rano Mendhro at Kak and left for Umerkot. Rano and Momal kept meeting each other for long and their love story gained profundity of feelings from both sides. However, King Hameer felt jealous about Rano to have succeeded in overpowering the most beautiful woman in the world he personally knew. So he kept a check on Rano and asked him not to meet Momal. Rano being his minister had to abide by the orders of his King friend. But his passion about Momal did not let him stay peacefully away from her. So usually he left for Ludhruva on his camel in the evening after work and returned to Umerkot by the next morning. Whenever he did that, which he did pretty often, he tried to stealthily go and meet Momal, it was pretty long distance though. Somehow he was caught one day and the king imprisoned him. But for the old friendship sake the king released him with conditions not to meet Momal again. But this had not to happen. He continued the same pursuit. Once Rano was unable to reach Kak, so Momal, out of passion and extreme wait for her beloved, asked her sister Somal to wear clothes like the ones Rano used to wear and slept by her side. The moment Rano arrived, he mistook Somal as Momal's lover and, in utter disgust, left the palace for Umerkot leaving behind his cane. As Momal woke up, she saw his cane and realized Rano had been to her room and seen her with Somal, rather mistaken Somal to be some man, and perhaps gone for good. This was too much for her. Momal waited for his return but to no avail. At last, when the push comes to shove, she resorted to go out for Rano in Umerkot. Disguised as a man, she finally searched him and stayed in Umerkot for some time. In a short span of time, Rano came to learn it was Momal, who had disguised herself. So he tried to go away from her. Then she pleaded him to forgive her for her mistake, which was basically not an intentional trick but an outburst of passionate feelings about Rano, and nothing else. Rano was too obstinate to forgive her. Out of desperation, she jumped in raging fire. When Rano came to learn this, he followed her in the same flames and got consumed by the same.Menka Shivdasani, Moomal Rano , Muse India Historicity The story of Momal-Rano is a combination of both fact and fiction. The names of places related to the tale are real, both within the boundaries of the province of Sindh and Rajasthan. However, the ideas of magic, Kak, concerns as to how Rano was able to travel so fast from Umerkot to Lodhruva almost everyday etc make it a legend. The story of Momal Rano has also been compared with the legend of Orpheus.Muzamil Syre, Khathuri Khep Kheter Mein, Sindhica Publishers, Karachi 2014 In the Greek myth, Sirens, beautiful yet dangerous creatures, lured nearby sailors with their enchanting voices/music and led their ships to wreck on the rocky coast of their island, Anthemoessa, looted and destroyed the seafarers.Siren (Greek mythology), Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Identically Momal and her servants/sister did the same at Kak Mahal. Orpheus was the one to overpower their music with his lyre and saved his ship.Orpheus (Greek mythology, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Rano overpowered the magical world of Momal and her company. Metaphorical significance The love of Momal and Rano is an allegorical metaphor for the love of the soul and divine. The separation and longing between two lovers parallels the separation of the Divine and the human soul and longing of both the divine and the human soul to merge and dissolve into each other much like Momal and Rano were unified in the burning fire. The human soul, ruh, longs for Allah and in absolute overpowering self abnegating devotion cares nothing for the world or society and seeks union with divinity in the crazed love experienced by Sufis.

With the goal of establishing TRANSIMS as an ongoing public resource available to the transportation community, TRANSIMS is made available under the NASA Open Source Agreement Version 1.3  Background  TRANSIMS is an integrated set of tools to conduct regional transportation system analyses based on a cellular automata microsimulator. It uses a new paradigm of modeling individual travelers and their multi-modal transportation based on synthetic populations and their activities. Compared to other transportation aggregate models, TRANSIMS represents time consistently and continuously, as well as detailed persons and households. Its time-dependent routing and person-based microsimulator also differ from other aggregate models.  Methodology = Overview  The goal of the methodology is to load traffic onto the network and iterate towards the Nash equilibrium. Submodules include population synthesizer, activity generator, route planner and microsimulator. Feedback from modules will be next input as the equilibration process iterates. Travelers are modeled to achieve a shorter path that is best for the overall population instead of a significantly better route. One important constraint is that travelers choose a transportation mode according to travel surveys rather than to optimize their travel needs. Image:transims.jpgBasic TRANSIMS Methodology  Input data  TRANSIMS creates a road network, a transit network, as well as transit schedules in this step. Usually, street and transit networks are available from metropolitan planning organizations. Networks can be exported from other traffic analysis tools into a fairly simple tabular format to be input into TRANSIMS. Several features are imbedded in TRANSIMS to edit networks. It can make use of some common GIS tools and formats (shapefiles) with regards to network editing and visulization. It can also understand important geographic information systems, such as state plane system, universal transverse mercator system, etc. There are challenges for network data. Street network is usually available through public Census Tiger/Line, commercial NavTeq, and especially networks prepared and maintained by MPOs. However, many details that are not typically provided by common data sources are needed, such as traffic signals, turn lanes, etc. In addition, street network must be topologically appropriate, that is, connections between links must be consistent and representative. Transit network must be compatible with the street network layer. Data usually must be compiled from several independent sources. Buses are flowing with the traffic, therefore results may conflict with original bus schedules.  Population synthesizer  This step is to mimic regional population to ensure that demographics closely match real population, and that households distribution spatially approximates that of regional population. Detailed functions of the population synthesize include the generation of synthetic households from the census block group data, development of each household demographic characteristics (income, members, etc.), placement of each synthetic household on a link in transportation network (activity locations), and assignment of vehicles to each household (sharing vehicles and rides within a household).Guin, Angshuman., Introduction to TRANSIMS, March 2010, https://t-square.gatech.edu/access/content/group/28974.201002/Introduction_to_TRANSIMS_Part1.pdfBeckman, Richard J.; Baggerly, Keith A.; McKay, Michael D., Creating Synthetic Baseline Populations, http://tmip.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/clearinghouse/docs/transims_series/csbp.pdf Two types of data are applicable in this step. STF3 data is aggregate data describing relatively small regions named block groups, and PUMS is disaggregate data covering a much larger area and reduced to a 5% sample.Guin, Angshuman., Introduction to TRANSIMS, March 2010, https://t-square.gatech.edu/access/content/group/28974.201002/Introduction_to_TRANSIMS_Part1.pdfSmith, LaRon; Beckman, Richard; Baggerly, Keith; Anson, Doug; Williams, Michael., TRANSIMS: TRansportation ANalysis and SIMulation System: Project Summary and Status, 1995, http://ntl.bts.gov/DOCS/466.html One challenge for this step is the extrapolation of census data may not be accurate. Furthermore, additional land use data is necessary to allocate households appropriately to activity locations. Image:Transims population synthesizer.pngPopulation Synthesizer Input&Output;  Activity generator  This step is to generate household activities, activity priorities, activity locations, activity times, and mode and travel preferences. This step requires additional data input to assign individual activities. The main input data is a detailed activity survey that is representative. General activity assignment process is to match synthetic households with corresponding survey households based on socioeconomic data collected. In addition, small random variations are applied to survey records to avoid exact duplications for the many different synthetic households. Based on the input demographics, a list of travel activities will be produced for each household. These activities will be designated as \\"household\\" or \\"individual\\" activities. Associated with each activity is a set of parameters defining the activity importance, the activity duration, and a time interval during which the activity must be performed, if it is performed at all (for example, work is mandatory, so a work trip must be made, but a shopping trip is typically not as important and may be skipped on a given day if the scheduling is too difficult). Locations, such as the household address and the workplace and school addresses, will be provided for mandatory activities. Locations of other activities (shopping) are not specified- the planner will choose these from a list for the locality.Smith, LaRon; Beckman, Richard; Baggerly, Keith; Anson, Doug; Williams, Michael., TRANSIMS: TRansportation ANalysis and SIMulation System: Project Summary and Status, 1995, http://ntl.bts.gov/DOCS/466.html Mode preference is also modeled based on survey records rather than route optimization. There are several challenges for the activity generator. Limited sample size in the survey may create a coarse activity assignment. It highly depends on the availability of a recent and up-to-date activity survey, as well as detailed zoning information requiring manual adjustments. Last, it may generate some illogical activity patterns for certain regions.  Route planner  This step is to read individual activities previously generated, then determine the fastest route at that time of the day. The route planner has several features. Households are routed in a coordinated fashion to allow for ride sharing. The algorithm includes time-dependent optimization of the network based on link delays that vary during the day. The router does not choose the transportation mode but finds the best route given the mode. The router starts by using well-known traffic assignment function BPR+ to estimate link delays based on the number of trips routed through each link.Guin, Angshuman., Introduction to TRANSIMS, March 2010, https://t-square.gatech.edu/access/content/group/28974.201002/Introduction_to_TRANSIMS_Part1.pdf It then determines the optimal route for each trip and creates precise trip plans. A trip plan is a sequence of modes, routes, and planned departure and arrival times at the origin and destinations, and mode changing facilities projected to move individuals to activity locations.Smith, LaRon; Beckman, Richard; Baggerly, Keith; Anson, Doug; Williams, Michael., TRANSIMS: TRansportation ANalysis and SIMulation System: Project Summary and Status, 1995, http://ntl.bts.gov/DOCS/466.html Image:Transims route planner.pngRoute Planner Input&Output;  Microsimulator  This step is to execute all travel plans created by the router on a second by second basis throughout the network. It uses Cellular Automata principles to analyze the interaction between individual vehicles. The microsimulator produces individual locations of all travelers and vehicles at all times. The microsimulator and the router work in an iterative loop to equilibrate the assigned traffic in the network. The microsimulator follows those travel plans and determines a new set of link delays that are used to replace the ones previously used by the router. This process iterate until equilibrium is achieved. Image:Transims microsimulator.pngMicrosimulator Input&Output;  Feedback  Feedback is applied to the equilibration process iterating between router and microsimulator. Through feedback module, some routes may be found infeasible. These activities are then passed back to the activity generator to determine appropriate alternatives. Some trip plans cannot be followed in the microsimulator because of time-dependent road closures and other triggers. In this case, individuals with those plans are passed back to the router for new routing suggestions.  Results  TRANSIMS can create aggregate results comparable to traditional analysis tools. The microsimulation can lead to highly detailed snapshot data, for example, the exact location of every traveler at any given time. Since the amount of data is difficult to comprehend, the results need to be effectively visualized. Visualization tools that are commonly used include the original TRANSIMS visualizer, fourDscape and the Balfour (software) visualizer, ArcGIS and similar GIS tools, Google Earth and NASA World Wind, Advanced Visualization (NCSA), and NEXTA.  Applications  There has been much discussion in the transportation profession concerning how widely adopted TRANSIMS will be, producing several schools of thought. Skeptics believe the large data requirements, computer requirements, and training requirements will limit use of TRANSIMS to a handful of the largest MPOs. A second school of thought is that regulatory requirements will quickly force the use of TRANSIMS in many regions. This accelerated adoption of TRANSIMS might exceed the capability of project staff to support the affected regions. A final school of thought is that in the beginning, TRANSIMS will indeed be used mainly by larger MPOs with particularly sophisticated transportation planning questions. Subsequently, TRANSIMS would evolve into versions which would be more appropriate for MPOs with smaller staffs and different analysis needs. Experience with the earlier software suggests that this last scenario is most likely. It is also the most promising scenario for bringing new technology to the broadest audience in a less painful manner.Travel Model Improvement Program, Arlington TX, Early Deployment of TRANSIMS: Issue Paper, 1999,  Dallas case study  The Dallas case focused on development of a microsimulation in TRANSIMS which would be robust enough to execute the travel itinerary of each individual in an urban region. The microsimulation developed was limited to automobile trips, and methods were developed to use existing NCTCOG‚Äôs zonal production/attraction information as the source of traveler demand on the system. The microsimulation executed approximately 200,000 trips (between 5:00 A.M. and 10:00 A.M.) in and through the study area. It ran in real time on five SUN SPARC workstations (‚Äúreal time‚Äù meaning a five-hour period took five hours).Travel Model Improvement Program, Arlington TX, Early Deployment of TRANSIMS: Issue Paper, 1999,  Portland case study  In contrast to the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù planning question explored in Dallas, the Portland case study explored the effects of different types of data on the results and sensitivity of TRANSIMS. The route planner and microsimulation capability developed for Dallas was expanded to include large vehicles, transit vehicles, and transit passengers. This includes the complicated tasks of incorporating into the data base all transit vehicle schedules, the different operating characteristics of rail and buses, and simulating the interaction of transit vehicles and private vehicles. Two sensitivity tests were under consideration. The first tested the effect of generating synthetic local streets instead of realistically coding every single street in the region. The second test explored the effect of synthesizing traffic signal plans. To test these and other model sensitivities, the Portland staff assembled the actual local street and traffic signal plans to compare with the results of the synthesis.Travel Model Improvement Program, Arlington TX, Early Deployment of TRANSIMS: Issue Paper, 1999, These tests determined the effect of the data synthesis on the sensitivity of the TRANSIMS models.

He is best known for his work at Walt Disney Productions. Biography Geronimi was born in Chiavenna, Italy, immigrating to the United States as a young child. Geronimi's earliest work in the animation field was for the J.R. Bray Studios, where he worked with Walter Lantz. Geronimi left Bray in 1931 to join Walt Disney Productions, where he remained until 1959. Geronimi started off in the shorts department as an animator, eventually becoming a director. His 1941 short, Lend a Paw, won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Geronimi moved into directing feature-length animated films after the end of World War II, mainly working for Walt Disney Productions. He was one of the directors on Bambi, Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Lady and the Tramp, Sleeping Beauty, and One Hundred and One Dalmatians. After Geronimi left Disney in 1959, he worked in television for a number of years (mostly at UPA), including directing many episodes of the 1967 animated Spider-Man series. He retired from animation sometime in the late 1960s, and provided illustrations for children's books. Geronimi received the 1978 Winsor McCay Award from the International Animated Film Society, ASIFA-Hollywood, for his lifetime of contributions to the animation field. The award was presented by his long-time friend and colleague Walter Lantz. Geronimi was also posthumously inducted as a Disney Legend on July 14, 2017. In 2019, Sleeping Beauty was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Geronimi died on April 24, 1989 at his home in Newport Beach, California, aged 87.

Just the Four Of Us, Billboard (magazine) Of the four founding members, only brothers Brendan and Declan Murphy have remained continuously part of the group; the occupants of the other positions have varied. History The 4 of Us released their first album, Songs for the Tempted on CBS Records in 1989, with the single \\"Mary\\", becoming one of the most played songs on Irish radio that year. Consequently, the album went double platinum in the Republic of Ireland and won Best Album of the Year at the Irish Music Awards, defeating the internationally known act U2. The album Man Alive followed on Sony/Columbia Records in 1992, and saw the group enter the UK charts for the first time, with the album entering the chart at No. 64, and the single, \\"She Hits Me\\" spending four weeks on the chart peaking at No. 35.(13 March 1993). Hits of the UK, Billboard (magazine) (listing \\"She Hits Me\\" debuting at #35 on UK chart) The band then lost momentum, scrapping the release of Amplifier, their proposed third album but released two singles, \\"Change (Amplifier Version)\\" and \\"Someone's Got to Lose\\" in 1997. They did not separate however, and eventually returned to recording albums, releasing the largely acoustic- based Classified Personal on the FUTURE INC. label in 1999.(9 October 2007). 'We can't wait to get back there', Derry Journal 2000s Off the Record, an album of re-recordings of the band's best known songs appeared on EMI in 2000 and included the previously unreleased songs \\"The Girl Next Door\\" and \\"She's So Real\\". In 2003, the single \\"Sunlight\\", which would appear on the 2004 album Heaven and Earth, began to receive airplay and was voted fourth in a poll to find the 'best Irish single ever', conducted by the national radio station Today FM. In November 2006, the band released the album Fingerprints and followed this with a live album, Live at Vicar Street in 2009. Throughout 2010/2011 via their Facebook page, the band previewed exclusive content, including previously unreleased tracks \\"The Way the River Flows\\" and \\"I Guess I Wasn't Made for These Times\\" which was made available as a free download single for a limited period. On 21 October 2011, Brendan confirmed via The Gerry Anderson Show on BBC Radio Ulster, that a brand new studio album is in progress and scheduled for release in 2012. He also mentioned the possibility of a 'Best Of...' compilation in the very near future. Declan announced on 5 December 2011 via Facebook that the previously unavailable third album Amplifier would be released as a free download on the band's official website. On 14 August 2013, the first track \\"Seventy-Three\\" from the new album Sugar Island was premiered on the band's The4OfUsMurphyMusic YouTube channel. This was followed up on 10 September with \\"Hell to Pay\\". On 25 March 2015, \\"Birds Eye View\\" was premiered before getting its mastered radio release on 8 April.

Mullaghcleevaun lies on the main \\"central spine\\" of the whole range that runs from Kippure in the north, to Lugnaquillia in the south; and in particular, it lies on the continuous \\"central boggy ridge\\" that runs from the Sally Gap to Tonelagee. To the east of the main summit of Mullaghcleevaun is Mullaghcleevaun East Top . Below the summit of Mullaghcleevaun lies the corrie lake of Cleevaun Lough, Wicklow's highest natural lake at . Naming According to Irish academic Paul Tempan, Patrick Weston Joyce notes that Mullaghcleevaun was named after a \\"cradle-like depression near the top, presumably the one occupied by Cleevaun Lough\\".  Geography  Mullaghcleevaun is the 2nd highest peak in the Wicklow Mountains, and is situated in the central sector of the whole range, on the western edge overlooking the Poulaphouca Reservoir (also called the \\"Blessington Lakes\\"). Mullaghcleevan's prominence of , makes it the 8th-highest mountain in Ireland on the MountainViews Online Database, 100 Highest Irish Mountains, where the minimum prominence threshold is 100 metres. Mullaghcleevaun's flat summit is visible from other peaks in the range, and its massif also includes the subsidiary summit of Mullaghcleevaun East Top , whose prominence of qualifies it as Hewitt. To the south-east of Mullaghcleevaun East Top is the summit of Carrigshouk , whose prominence of qualifies it as an Arderin. Further away on Mullaghcleevaun's larger massif is Duff Hill , which lies to the north. Mullaghcleevaun's most distinctive feature is its deep northern corrie, which contains Wicklow's highest natural lake, Lough Cleevaun . Mullaghcleevaun's southeastern slopes are the source of the Glenmacnass River which flows down the Glenmacnass Waterfall into the Glenmacnass Valley and on to Laragh.  Hill walking  A common route to the summit of Mullaghcleevaun is from the south via an 8.5-kilometre 3-4 hour walk which starts from a small car-park in the forest below Carraigshouk (the car-park is known locally as \\"The Oasis\\") just off the R115 road (also called the Old Military Road). This southerly route ascends to Mullaghcleevaun East Top and then to the summit of Mullaghcleevaun, before retracing to the car-park. A similar distance route can be done from the north starting at the car-park at Ballynultagh Gap (), which lies between Black Hill and Sorrel Hill). A longer undertaking is the complete north-east to south-west \\"boggy ridge\\" that runs from the Sally Gap to Carrigvore , and then on to Gravale , and then after a col, the ridge continues south-westwards to meet Duff Hill , and then on to Mullaghcleevaun East Top and Mullaghcleevaun itself. Getting from the Sally Gap to Mullaghcleevan is itself an 8.5-kilometre 3-4 hour walk, which some hill walkers avoid having to completely retrace back to the Sally Gap, and thus completing a 7-hour walk, by instead using two cars.

Further, it is found within the male genital tract and is present on the surface of mature sperm cells. CD52 is a peptide of 12 amino acids, anchored to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). Since it is highly negatively charged and present on sperm cells and lymphocytes, it has been conjectured that its function is anti-adhesion, allowing cells to freely move around.

It is believed to be a translation of a Latin work, which is originally derived from the Greek story The Acts of Andrew and Matthew in the City of Anthropophagi, dated around the 4th century. However, the author of Andreas added the aspect of the Germanic hero to the Greek story to create the poem Andreas, where St. Andrew is depicted as an Old English warrior, fighting against evil forces. This allows Andreas to have both poetic and religious significance.  Origins  Although the author of Andreas is unknown, there are more general theories concerning its origins. Andreas is the first poem in the Vercelli Book, and is followed by a poem entitled The Fates of the Apostles, written by Cynewulf. Since both works have similar subjects, and because of their proximity in the Vercelli book, they were at first thought to be written by the same author. Andreas is often tied to Cynewulf because of its religious theme; although the exact identity of Cynewulf is unknown, all of the proposed identities were religious figures of the late 8th to early 10th centuries. This clearly ties to Andreas' religious theme, and leads scholars to make a connection between the two. Andreas is included in a group of twelve poems, often referred to as \\"the Cynewulf group\\". Still, only four poems are truly attributed to Cynewulf, which are those that are directly marked with runic symbols of his name. Other scholars argue that Andreas may have been written by a disciple of Cynewulf, which would explain the parallels between the two works. However, still other researchers argue that they are different authors because of the drastic differences in the writing style. Some scholars even deduce that Andreas was influenced by Beowulf, as there are many likenesses between the two works in style, language, and theme.  Content  The poem itself is a 1,722 line poem that tells the story of St. Andrew, as he rescues St. Matthew from a cannibalistic race called Mermedonians. Cameron states: \\"The poem is forceful and is the closest to Beowulf in style and tone among the surviving Old English poems\\". In this anonymously written tale, St. Andrew defies the hardships that he faces, such as turbulent sea and other types of torture and captivity, which mirror the pain and suffering that Christ experienced. The work has religious significance because of the way St. Andrew is loyal to God, and his troops are loyal to him in the poem. This literary allusion helps to give the work religious symbolism, which is characteristic of many works of the time. The first five hundred lines of the poem tell of St. Andrew's time spent at sea rescuing Matthew, which was his mission from God. Matthew had been blinded and held captive by a troop of cannibals in Mermedonia. Jesus and two angels accompany St. Andrew on the ship, masked as a helmsman and two sailors. As this is a tale of discipleship, St. Andrew, or Andreas preaches to the helmsman about the good news of the Bible and the stories of the life of Christ. He is unaware of the true identities of his crew as he speaks with Christ about His life. Andreas' followers loyally stay by his side through the turbulent seas. This ties into the alleged Greek influence on Andreas, as some scholars interpret this a \\"comitatus\\", which Riedinger defines as \\"the traditional aristocratic warrior band.\\" Andreas holds loyal faith in God's power to calm the seas, and the ship and the seas begin to settle. Andrew and his men drift off to sleep, and awaken outside Mermedonia. Christ and His two angels had raised them up and placed them outside the city while they slept. This event allowed St. Andrew to realize their identities. Then, in epic and heroic style, St. Andrew is made invisible by God for the close of the poem, which allows him to free the imprisoned from Mermedonia. After doing so, he reveals himself to the enemy and is tortured for three days and nights. Upon praying for forgiveness, God frees and heals Andreas and punishes all of Mermedonia. When the Mermedonians repent and convert, they are restored, and Andreas establishes a Christian church. Andreas is able to sail on after appointing a bishop to watch over the church. This poem has strong religious importance, as many parallels can be drawn between Christ and St. Andrew. Also, this poem encourages repentance and discipleship, which were vital to the growth and well-being of the Catholic Church at the time. The religious significance of Andreas may be the very reason why this text survived, as monks copied it in their manuscripts because of its religious message. The Andrew legend in Old English prose The story also appears in a briefer prose version in the Blickling Homilies (no. 19). A somewhat different treatment of the apostle is found in the prose Life by √Ülfric of Eynsham, who relates Andrew's martyrdom in Achaia.

It is one of the earliest Canadian feature films. The film starred and was co-written by Canadian actress Nell Shipman. With an estimated budget of over $67,000, it was the most successful silent film in Canadian history. The film is noteworthy as it starred Shipman and was produced by her husband, Ernest. Shipman was one of the first women to do a nude scene on screen in the movie.Dawn E. Monroe, On The Job: Canadian Women of Achievement In 1918, they created a production company, Shipman-Curwood Producing Company, to produce Back to God's Country. The film was the only film the company would produce, and was based on a short story, \\"Whapi, the Walrus\\", by James Oliver Curwood.Gutenberg.org Curwood's story was adapted to the screen by Nell herself. She changed the protagonist of the film from a great dane to the female lead, Dolores. Shipman also shaped her character into a heroine, who saves her husband. Curwood was infuriated with Shipman, but commercially the film was extremely successful, posting a 300 percent profit and grossing a million-and-a-half dollars. Cast Preservation status  The film has been re-made twice by Hollywood, but the original version was believed to have been lost.

It became particularly successful during the 4th century BCE, to judge from the intensive building at the site.V.C. Petrakos 1968:68-70, noted by Eran Lupu, \\"Sacrifice at the Amphiareion and a Fragmentary Sacred Law from Oropos\\", Hesperia 72.3 (July 2003:321-340).. The hero Amphiaraos was a descendant of the seer Melampos and initially refused to participate in the attack on Thebes (detailed in the Seven Against Thebes of Aeschylus) because he could foresee that it would be a disaster.The Roman poet Statius wrote an epic poem on this myth in the 1st century CE. In some versions of the myth,Pindar, Ninth Nemean Ode. the earth opens and swallows the chariot of Amphiaraos, transforming him into a chthonic hero.Pausanias 1.34.2 Today the site is found east of the modern town Markopoulo Oropou in the Oropos municipality of Attica, Greece The sanctuary is located 37.2 km NNE of AthensThe site is described for the non-specialist by E. Melas, in Temples and Sanctuaries of Ancient Greece: A Companion Guide, Melas, editor, (London: Thames & Hudson) 1973. at a sacred spring; it contained a temple of Amphiaraos (with an acrolithic cult statue), as well as a theater, stoa, and associated structures. The temenos extended for some 240 metres northeast from the Temple of Amphiaraos (hence Amphiareion) along a streambed. The cult, which was both public and private, dates to the 5th century BCE.Two fragmentary fourth- century inscribed sacred laws reflecting the ritual and votive reliefs (Eran Lupu 2003) supplement Pausanias' description of the incubation, practiced in the second century CE by incubation on a sacrificed ram's fleece. There was an upswing in the sanctuary‚Äôs reputation as a healing site during the plague that hit Athens in the late 5th BCE Herodotus relates that the oracular response of this shrine was one of only two correct answers to the test put to them all by the Lydian king Croesus.Histories, 1.47-49: Croesus asks what he will be doing on a predetermined day, when he was boiling a tortoise and a lamb in a bronze pot with bronze lid. The oracle's answer is, in contrary to that of Delphi, not preserved (¬ß49) but Herodotos does say that \\"he [Croesus] believed that from there [Amphiareionic oracle] too he had received a true answer\\". There were many dedications from Greeks, notable Romans, and others, many with inscriptions.In Histories, 1.92.2, Herodotus says that Croesos made a dedication at the Amphiareion. On the southeast side of the streambed there are extensive remains of domestic structures as well as an unusually well- preserved clepsydra. At the Amphiareion, in addition to the presumed annual festival, Greater Amphiareia were celebrated in an agonistic festival of athletic games, every fifth year. Two reliefs of the late 5th-early 4th century BCE seem to provide the earliest attestations of the festival games; there is an inscribed catalogue of victors at the Greater Amphiareia that dates before 338 BCE.Lupu 2003:322 note 5 Amphiaraos was also worshipped at the site of Rhamnous about 17.5 km southeast, as well as at Athens, Argos, Sparta, and other sites. The cult at the Amphiareion came to an end with the outlawing of non-Christian worship in the Theodosian decrees at the end of the 4th century CE. In 414 BCE Aristophanes produced a comedy, Amphiaraos, of which fragments survive as quotations.A.B. Petropoulou, \\"The Eparche documents and the early oracle at Oropus\\" Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies 22 (1981:57f).  Sanctuary of Amphiaraos  Plan of the Sanctuary of Amphiaraus. At the Temple of Amphiaraos, the site is about 154 m in elevation, with a gentle slope to the northeast, as it fills the northwest bank of a small ravine between two hills. The sanctuary was located near the border of Attica and Boiotia, the respective spheres of control of Athens and Thebes; control over the site passed back and forth between the rival cities until Alexander the Great destroyed Thebes in 335 BCE. In the 2nd century CE, the Greek periegetic writer Pausanias stated: > I think that Amphiaraos most of all dedicated himself to interpreting > dreams: it is clear that, when he was considered a god, he set up an oracle > of dreams. And the first thing is to purify oneself, when someone comes to > consult Amphiaraos, and the purification ritual is to sacrifice to the god, > and people sacrifice to him and to all those whose names are on (the altar), > and - when these things are finished ‚Äì they sacrifice a ram and spread out > its skin under themselves, lie down waiting for the revelation of a dream. > Description of Greece 1.34.5 An inscription from the site, however, states that each man may sacrifice what he wants. Some variation in practice during the nine centuries of cult activity at the sanctuary may be expected. The baths of the site were famous in antiquity. The locations of a stadion and a hippodrome are unknown.  Temple of Amphiaraos  Interior view of the Temple of Amphiaraos showing interior colonnade and arm of an acrolithic statue The early 4th-century BCE temple of Amphiaraos was of an unusual Doric hexastyle in antis plan: i.e. it had six columns across the front fa√ßade between small projecting walls. The antae were capped with half columns, giving the appearance of an octastyle fa√ßade. It measures Behind the columns was a pronaos, leading into a cella with two rows of five unfluted internal columns. Alongside the second pair of columns back from the pronaos there was a base for the acrolithic cult statue of Amphiaraos of which one arm remains in situ. In the rear wall of the cella, there was a threshold, perhaps a later addition. View SW across altar, theatral area, sacred spring, and temple On axis with the center line of the temple, and about northeast, are the remains of the altar divided into sections with inscriptions to a number of gods and heroes. Pausanias (1.34.3) says that the altar was dedicated to five groups:Pausanias (1.34.3) * Heracles, Zeus and Apollo the Healer (Œ†Œ±ŒπœéŒΩ) * Heroes and heroes‚Äô wives * Hestia, Hermes, Amphiaraos, and of the children of Amphiaraos, Amphilochos * Aphrodite, Panacea (\\"all-cure\\"), Iaso, Hygeia, and Athena the Healer (Œ†Œ±ŒπœâŒΩŒØŒ±) * Nymphs and Pan; the rivers Achelous and Cephisus Wrapping around the altar on the west side is a stepped structure that may have served as an early theatral area before the construction of the theater. Immediately to the east is the sacred spring, where Pausanias says worshipers threw coins when they were healed of a disease.Pausanias, 1.34.4 Immediately northeast of the spring is the structure traditionally called the men‚Äôs bath. Line of dedication bases, looking NE To the northeast of the temple was a line of dedications of statuary, of which the bases (illustration, right) have largely survived; the avenue stretched for around along the road into the sanctuary. Among the more notable dedications, all of the Roman era: * 42 BCE inscription honoring Marcus Junius Brutus as a Tyrannicide * 86‚Äì81 BCE inscription for the Roman dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla * post-27 BCE inscription for Marcus Agrippa * 1st BCE inscription for Appius Claudius Pulcher * inscription for Gnaius Calpurnius Piso There are also the remains of a small temple at the southwest extremity of this area.  Theatre  Proscaenium of the theater. The theatre is dated to the 2nd century BCE by inscriptions and the seating area was likely composed of wooden seats on stone supports. Five marble prohedria (seat of honor at the front of the seating area) were discovered placed around the orchestra, which had a radius of 12.4 m. Two parodoi (side entryways) led off from the orchestra between the seating area of the cavea and the stage building. The Doric order proscaenium of the stage structure (c. 12 m wide) is well preserved and thus important for the study of theater design. The theater would have held approximately three hundred spectators.  Stoa  View of the Stoa looking NE. Dating to the mid-4th century BCE, the stoa measured 11 by 110 m with 39 exterior Doric columns and 17 internal Ionic columns.The stoa is dated by the shape of the Doric capitals. There were stone benches set into the back walls of the structure, perhaps where the suppliants of the god slept and awaited their dreams. The sexes may have been segregated as may have been the case for the bath to the northeast of the stoa, which is traditionally called the women‚Äôs bath.  Clepsydra  View SW of the clepsydra. On the southeast side of the streambed opposite the sacred spring are the remains of an unusually well-preserved clepsydra. This instrument is important in the study of ancient methods of timekeeping in that it is an example of an inflow water clock. Since an inflow clock measures time by the filling of a known volume from a constant rate of inflow, it is much more accurate than an outflow water clock in measuring the gradations between full and empty.An outflow water clock has a rate of outflow that is dependent on the mass of water remaining in the reservoir; the less water remains, the slower is the outflow. The clepsydra was composed of a central, square reservoir with a steep stairway on the south side to allow access to the bronze plug at the bottom of the reservoir. Domestic structures for the operation of the sanctuary are closely packed along the southeast side of the ravine, both north and south of the clepsydra.

Life and career=Early life Swindells grew up in the Bath and Bristol area, dropping out of art college to play keyboards with the rock band Squidd. Relocating to London in 1973 and living in squats, he recorded his debut solo album, Messages for RCA in 1974. Produced by his manager Mark Edwards, Swindells felt the production quality to be poor, despite the presence of quality musicians. A follow up album Swindells' Swallow was recorded, mastered and test pressings manufactured, but the deal fell through. Departed from his manager, Swindells joined Pilot, recording the 1977 album Two's a Crowd. In 1978 he joined a reformed Hawkwind, renamed as Hawklords, for the 25 Years On album and tour. 1980s In 1980 he recorded another solo album, Fresh Blood, released by ATCO, but was dropped when it failed to hit sufficient sales, despite reaching No. 3 in the US airplay charts. Swindells would go on contribute songs to Roger Daltrey on \\"Martyrs and Madmen\\" and \\"Treachery\\" for Daltrey's 1982 compilation album Best Bits, before temporarily turning his attention away from the music business. In 1983, Swindells switched careers to club promoting and party organising. 1990s In the early 1990s, he decided to re-invent himself as a journalist, writing the internet column for Time Out under the name Spyder for many years, as well as a gadget/lifestyle colourmn for Attitude, before becoming the editor of the magazine's website. Throughout his career changes, Swindells continued to compose and perform music. 2000s In 2003, Swindells played keyboards and sang lead vocals in the band Danmingo together with Jerry Richards, Jon Moss and Winston Blissett. Swindells wrote all of the songs, apart from two band collaborations and one co-write with Stephen Meade (aka Shanks) and the late Kent Brainerd. As of 10 December 2013, Swindells had been number 1 on the Reverb Nation Singer- songwriter Chart For London for several days. He then released the double download DanMingo album under his own name. In 2009, Swindells was instrumental in the formation (or reformation) of the Hawklords, a musical collective of ex-Hawkwind members, playing a special show in memory of artist Barney Bubbles. The show was advertised as a benefit concert 'with a view to setting up a foundation/annual award for innovative album cover design, and a memorial plaque for him'. 2010‚Äìpresent In 2010, Hawklords performed a mini tour of the UK. In 2011, the group were active in several appearances across the UK, and a touring line-up underwent a full national tour in October 2011. In 2012, they announced they were working on an album, titled We Are One. In May 2012, via the band's Facebook page, it was announced that, due to health reasons, Swindells would not be participating in the planned 2012 tour and he subsequently terminated his involvement with the band. Swindells re- discovered two 'lost' albums from 1980: The Invisible Man, and Treachery. They were released on Flicknife Records on 27 February 2012. His 1980 album Fresh Blood was released on CD for the first time with the label Atomhenge/Cherry Red in August 2009. His 1974 album Messages, along with a bonus CD of the hitherto unreleased Swindells' Swallow, was re-released by Esoteric Recordings/Atomhenge on 26 November 2009. Early in 2012, Swindells put together an ad-hoc, 'all star' jamming band called The Plastic Sturgeons. Special guest musicians have included Guy Pratt and Dale Davis. There have only been two gigs to date which were recorded by Roy Weard. As of 10 December 2013, The Plastic Sturgeons have been number 1 in The Reverb Nation London Jam Chart for several weeks.

The show generally follows an investigator or team of investigators exploring what modern science can tell us about some of the great mysteries of history. Most programs incorporate primary source material, first-hand accounts, dramatic reenactments, and computer-generated imagery (CGI) to tell the story. The series originated in a series of the same name in the United Kingdom first shown by Channel 4 in 1999. The first two seasons for each country were broadly similar, but thereafter diverged. The US series includes some programs shown in other Channel 4 series (e.g. Secret History). In the case of original British episodes, PBS re-edited, re-branded and finally re-narrated them with various American voice artists. PBS description: \\"Scientists seek to uncover celebrated mysteries of the past in this occasional British series.\\" Episode topics have included the Titanic, D-Day, the Shroud of Turin, the Salem Witch Trials, Blackbeard's lost ship, and the first English translations of the Bible. The PBS series premiered on May 15, 2000, airing four programs in three days (the first episode, concerning the Extreme weather events of 535‚Äì536, was a two-parter). Despite an irregular schedule, new episodes continue to air.

Biography Born in Meulan, Yvelines, he entered the Paris conservatory in 1925 to study counterpoint and fugue with Charles Koechlin and orchestration and arrangement under Alexis Roland-Manuel. He graduated in 1931. During the forties Thiriet carved his career within film music, inspired by fellow composer Maurice Jaubert (who died in World War II), and wrote something like seventy scores from 1942 to 1960. Apart from his film work, Thiriet also composed several concert works, including a Flute concerto, twelve ballets and three operas. His style, which was influenced by Jaubert and Roland-Manuel, is characterized by taught construction and modest, nearly impressionistic harmonization and often bears a classical grace not unlike that of Francis Poulenc and Jean Fran√ßaix. His work was also part of the music event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics.

The Chicken House) Candy is a 2005 young adult novel by Kevin Brooks about a doomed teenage love affair between a musician and a prostitute. Plot summary The story opens when Joe Beck, a music lover with a knack for curiosity, meets 16-year-old Candy on the streets of London. Joe soon learns that Candy is not only a runaway from her home town, but also a teenage prostitute and heroin addict. He immediately becomes infatuated with her. The pair begin dating cautiously, visiting London Zoo once. Candy also comes to a gig that Joe and his band, The Katies, play at a local club. However, Candy's pimp, Iggy, feels that Joe is a threat, worrying that Joe will reduce the business Candy takes in and thus reducing Iggy's income. When Joe finds Candy beaten, the pair attack Iggy and leave the city to hide and to ease Candy off heroin. Iggy subsequently kidnaps Joe's older sister Gina, and uses her as a bargaining chip, claiming he will free her if Candy is returned to him. At the novel's climax, Joe, Candy, Joe's sister, and her boyfriend confront Iggy at Joe's family's remote country house. Candy stabs Iggy in the neck, concluding the novel's main story. Candy is sent off to a rehab centre for adolescents where Joe has a final meeting with her. Candy apologizes for everything and is taken away. Joe is left wondering where she is and if he will ever see her again. The last chapter briefly explains that Joe's band received a record deal and recorded Joe's song for Candy. Joe receives several calls for permission to record the song, but he never answers the messages. Although Joe is not at all upset by this, Candy very much is. In the final scene, Candy cries in Joe's arms, asking why their song was recorded. Did he have something to do with it? Left hanging on the streets all alone when Candy leaves, Joe is baffled, heartbroken, and still deeply in love.  Characters  Joe Beck: Young, na√Øve and caring, he is the novel's protagonist. Joe is in a band called The Katies, who at the end of the novel, go off to record without him. He is obsessed with Candy and does everything he can to help her with her addiction. Candy (Candice): A young prostitute, runaway, and heroin addict. Iggy: Candy's pimp, who controls her life by using her addiction as a tool. He is a violent man, bent on destroying Candy and Joe's forbidden relationship. Gina: Joe's older sister. She cares for and worries about Joe but is supportive of his relationship with Candy. She and Joe are very close. Mike: Gina's fianc√©. He provides Joe with many favors via connections through his DJing hobby. Has a good understanding of Iggy and his crew.  Symbolism  In a review of the novel, Professor Wendy Kelleher of Arizona State University states that the book focuses on the idea that \\"From the stories of Eve's seduction in the Garden of Eden to the present, men and women have chased the forbidden, sacrificing everything else in the bargain.\\" Brooks plays with this fundamental, human instinct through the use of Candy's drug addiction. As the story unfolds, language referring to drug addiction begins to describe Joe's love for Candy. The more Joe becomes involved with Candy, the more Joe becomes obsessed with how Candy makes him feel. In the novel, Joe claims \\"she fired me up and turned my body inside out ... and usually that would have messed me up so much I wouldn't have been able to feel anything, but this time I could feel it.\\" Therefore, Candy's drug addiction mirrors the obsessive love Joe has for her.

The book is about a custody battle involving a seven-year-old girl, Faith White, who may be seeing God. Plot summary When Mariah White catches her husband, Colin White, having an affair with another woman for the second time in their marriage, he files for divorce and gives her full custody of their child, Faith. After the divorce, Mariah becomes deeply depressed, while Faith develops an imaginary friend called her \\"Guard\\". Not long after, Faith begins to quote passages from the Bible, which she has never read. It's at this point that her mother takes her to see a therapist, fearing for her sanity. The therapist finds that Faith may in fact be seeing God. News of Faith's visions (or images of God) reach Ian Fletcher, a \\"Teleatheist\\", who is travelling around the United States to debunk \\"miracles\\" that feature God. Ian shows up at the Whites' house, where he has a confrontation with Millie Epstein, Faith's grandmother. This exchange later leads to Millie having a heart attack and upon arriving at the hospital being pronounced dead. About an hour later Faith kisses her grandmother goodbye, and raises her back to life. This further increases the attention that Faith receives from the public, with complete strangers and media representatives surrounding the house, making it impossible for Faith and her mother to continue on with their lives as normal. Faith performs a few other miracles, including healing a baby with AIDS and showing what appear to be stigmata. Colin, hearing of the commotion surrounding his daughter, sues Mariah for custody of Faith. Mariah and Faith flee to Kansas City, where they are confronted by Ian, who is visiting his autistic brother, Michael. Mariah and Faith end up staying with Ian, who promises Mariah that he will not betray them and that he will provide them with accommodation. After a confrontation with Faith trying to \\"heal\\" Michael, Ian becomes enraged. However, Mariah and Ian appear to have fallen in love. After hearing from Millie that Colin is suing her, Mariah takes Faith back home. Meanwhile, Faith is admitted to the hospital again and her mother is prevented from seeing her by the court. At this point, Faith's symptoms begin to worsen, eventually leaving her near death. Upon being reunited with her mother her health increases drastically, and in the end, Mariah is awarded custody. The holes that appeared in Faith's hands disappear, and her \\"Guard\\" vanishes. Mariah and Ian begin a romantic relationship, and they and Faith eventually live together as a family. At the end of the novel, it remains unclear whether the \\"Guard\\" is really gone forever, or is still with Faith.

A great-grandson of Robert Bolling (1646-1709), he was born in Virginia and sent to England for his education. On his return to Virginia, he studied law, but soon took over at Chellowe, a tobacco plantation in Buckingham County, Virginia inherited from his father. Though he published at least 35 poems in English periodicals during his lifetime, more poetry than any other colonist at the time, most of his works remained in manuscript, and remain unpublished. His papers are now owned by the University of Virginia Library and the Henry E. Huntington Library. His book A Memoir of a Portion of the Bolling Family in England and Virginia was published posthumously, in 1868; it was originally written in French and translated by a descendant of his brother. Bolling was a member of the House of Burgesses. He died in July 1775, possibly of a heart attack, in Richmond while attending the third Virginia Convention. The cantata Virginiana by composer Gregory Spears, for vocal quartet and Baroque ensemble, is based on texts written by Bolling during his failed courtship of his cousin Anne Miller in 1760. It was completed in 2015. NotesReferences *J.A. Leo Lemay, ed.

It was released at the end of 1981; a year in which Wilde had already scored three highly successful hit singles and a best-selling debut album. The single was another international success, topping the charts in France, Sweden and Switzerland and hitting the top ten in several other nations. It was released on the 7\\" format but also as a 12\\" single in Germany, although not in a remixed or extended version. The B-side of both releases was an exclusive non-album track called \\"Watching for Shapes\\". \\"Cambodia\\" was later included on Wilde's second album, Select, which was released six months after the single in May 1982. The album version of \\"Cambodia\\" runs for 7:13 minutes, as it is teamed with a more uptempo instrumental version of the song, called \\"Reprise\\". Musically and lyrically, \\"Cambodia\\" showed a change in direction for Wilde from the new wave feel of her debut album. The song was mainly synth-driven, with oriental- sounding percussion. The lyrics were inspired by the Operation Menu bombing campaign of Cambodia by the United States during the Vietnam War. It has sold 1,080,000 copies in France. Composition \\"Cambodia\\" was written by Marty Wilde and Ricki Wilde and has a length of seven minutes and thirteen seconds. The Independents Chris Mugan found the song reminiscent of a film noir. Stewart Mason of AllMusic noted that the song lacks the bubblegum pop influence present on Wilde's self-titled debut album, and is instead more synthesizer-driven. Matt James of PopMatters felt that the song was an attempt by Kim Wilde to prove that she could tackle serious issues, in the vein of The Human League's \\"The Lebanon\\" (1984) and Sting's \\"Russians\\" (1985). Critical reception According to Yahoo!, songs like \\"Cambodia\\", \\"View from a Bridge\\" (1982) and Wilde's version of \\"You Keep Me Hangin' On\\" (1986) brought her \\"very close to [the] hearts\\" of Australians. The Independents Chris Mugan deemed the song one of Wilde's \\"eighties classics\\" alongside \\"Kids in America\\". In the Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Colin Larkin opined that Wilde tried \\"a more adventurous sound\\" with \\"Cambodia,\\" indicating that she was \\"an exciting talent.\\" The Ipswich Star Wayne Savage said that \\"Cambodia\\" and \\"Chequered Love\\" (1981) are \\"seminal smashes\\" which prove that Wilde \\"struck gold more often than not.\\" Vogue Rachel Hahn called the song an \\"underrated classic\\". Stewart Mason of AllMusic noted that \\"Kim Wilde's second album didn't score any hits on the level of the debut's 'Kids in America,' although the dramatic 'Cambodia' was a sort of cult favorite in some circles.\\" Writing for the same website, John Bush called the track a \\"fan favorite\\" and an \\"odd, chilling attempt to record a dirge for Southeastern Asia.\\" In The Legacies of Jean-Luc Godard, Douglas Morrey wrote that \\"'Cambodia' is not...a particularly moving record\\".

The greatest use of the term since its coinage has been in relation to the annual Bioneers conference founded by Ausubel and his wife Nina Simons and held annually in San Rafael, California, and its participants. However, in recent years the term or derivations has seen increasing use independent of the Bioneers organization, suggesting an increasing acceptance of the term in popular usage.

It is derived from, and largely continues to follow English trust law, as modified by state and federal legislation. A number of unique features of Australian trust law arise from interactions with the Australian systems of company law, family law and taxation. Trusts were introduced in Australia in the 1970s for the mainstream population in regards to mortgage brokers activities and their regulation. General law of trusts A trust is a legal agreement where a person (the trustee) holds and manages property for the benefit of others in the agreement (the beneficiaries) as laid out in a trust deed. The trustee legally owns the properties but is obliged to act in accordance with the provisions of the deed. The word trust specifically refers to the duty or aggregate accumulation of obligation that rest upon a person described as the trustees.. The responsibilities of trustees are in relation to property held by them, or under their control. The trustees will be compelled by a court in its equitable jurisdiction to administer trust property in the manner lawfully prescribed by the trust instrument, or where there be no specific provision written or oral, or to the extent that such provision is invalid or lacking, in accordance with equitable principles. A trustee has a legal interest in the property of the trust. The beneficiary has an equitable interest. If a person holds both the legal interest and the equitable interest, then the equitable interest will cease to exist and a single legal estate will subsist.. See also: Stickney v. Keeble [1915] AC 386 Swarb Law UK Equity recognises cases where a party places trust/confidence in another, these relationships are protected by equity and are called fiduciary relationships. The critical feature of fiduciary relationships is that the trustee undertakes to act for or on behalf of the beneficiary in the exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the interest of the trustee in a legal or practical sense... In the exercise of a fiduciary duty, a trustee must not take a benefit from their position as trustee unless the beneficiary or beneficiaries have given their informed consent.Boardman v Phipps . See also . Common trusts=Express trust In an express trust, the settlor indicates an intention to and deliberately creates the trust, while a non-express trust is one that arises by operation of law, such as when created by statute or by judges, such as a constructive trust. An express trust may be an public express trust such as one for a charitable purpose, or a private express trust with the private purpose. Classification of trusts There are a variety of trusts recognised and used in Australia, including unit trusts, discretionary trusts, hybrid trusts, and testamentary trusts. Under a discretionary trust the share, if any, which each beneficiary is to receive is determined by the trustees. Therefore, the trustee has a discretion as to which beneficiary is to receive income or capital under the trust even if there is a duty for them to distribute the income. In addition, the trustees also have a discretion as to the amount that each beneficiary will receive. However, the beneficiary has no real right substantively. Streaming a category of trust income to a particular beneficiary provides tax planning opportunities. For example, foreign tax credits can be best used by resident individual beneficiaries with high marginal tax rates and net capital gains can be best used by beneficiaries with carried forward capital losses, low-income beneficiaries with carried forward revenue losses and minors able to receive excepted trust income. However, discretionary trusts are usually unsuitable for the accumulation of profits as the undistributed income will generally be taxed at 45%. Family trusts are often used to distribute income to beneficiaries in an attempt to achieve the lowest tax outcomes available to the members of the trust. Discretionary trusts also protect assets when individual members become insolvent or bankrupt. Asset protection is also extended to other types of liabilities. The power of appointment of the trustee of a discretionary trust is held by the Appointor. In some trust deeds, the person holding the power of appointment of the trustee is called the Custodian or the Principal of the trust. The Appointor is usually a natural person but can also be a company. Generally, upon the death of the Appointor, in the absence of an alternate appointment in the trust deed, the personal legal representative (executor) of the Appointor becomes the Appointor. The real power in relation to the control of the trust rests with the Appointor because of the ability to terminate the appointment of the trustee and appoint a different trustee. This must be kept in mind when considering succession and estate planning involving assets held in a discretionary trust. Creating a trust A trust can be intentionally created during the settlor's life (inter Vivos) by declaration or transfer.. A deceased estate is a testamentary trust which automatically arises on the death of the testator. Courts may also create trusts, such as constructive trusts, as an equitable remedy. Declaration of trust A settlor can declare him/herself trustee of his/her own property. The settlor already holds title to the property and all that needs to be done is to make a valid declaration. However, a declaration of trust will not be allowed out of an invalid gift. Formalities relevant depend on nature of trust property. A trust of land must comply with statutory requirements based on the Statute of Frauds 1677. Where the trust is created by virtue of a contract made as consideration for marriage, or a contact which concerns any interests in land, s 4 of the Statute of Frauds (or their equivalent legislation in other states) may operate to void such a contract unless it is evidenced in writing and signed by both parties to be charged.Fletcher v Burns (1997) 12 BPR 22,937 Trusts created by transfer A settlor can create an express trust by transferring property to a trustee to hold on trust. Two requirements must be satisfied: * declaration of trust, which must establish that the recipient of the property is intended to take the property in the capacity of trustee and not beneficially. The words used by the settlor will be construed in the context of the transfer itself.Choihram International SA v Pagarini . * there must be a valid transfer of trust property following the principle set out in Corin v Patton. which held a transfer may be valid in equity even though it may not be considered valid at law. A transfer will be considered valid in equity only when the settlor has done all the things that must be done to transfer their interest in the property. The things required to be done by the settlor cannot be done by anyone else. Trusts of land created by transfer must be evidenced in writing, as required by provisions derived from the Statute of Frauds 1677. See also Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) s23C.. A trust that fails to meet the requirement to transfer property in writing will not be void, rather it will be unenforceable.Gardner v Rowe (1828) 5 Russ 258; 38 ER 1024.

Medlen drove for John Force Racing in 2004, 2005, and 2006, campaigning in the Castrol Syntec Ford Mustang Fuel Funny Car, and in 2007, campaigning in the Auto Club/Pleasant Holiday Ford Mustang Fuel Funny Car. He had a total of 6 career wins. His first win came during his Rookie season in 2004 at Brainerd International Raceway. Medlen was born in Oakdale, CA, the son of John and Mary (Mimi) Medlen and brother of Eryn Medlen. He worked as a mechanic for John Force and past teammate Tony Pedregon for 8 years until Pedregon left to join his brother Cruz's race team. Medlen was moved into Pedregon's Castrol Syntec-sponsored car. In 2004, he was a top contender for the NHRA Road to the Future Funny Car Rookie of the Year. He followed with 3 wins in 2005 and 2 wins in 2006. Each year he raced, he placed in the top five or higher in NHRA Championship Points. Prior to 2004, his fastest elapsed time was 4.681 seconds. His fastest speed was 328.54 MPH. He had 8 #1 qualifiers and a 94-65 win-loss record. Medlen was a champion calf roperMedlen.qxd in high school and considered a career as a professional team roper with his partner and mentor, World Champion Team Roper Jerold Camarillo. He also loved to build custom motorcycles and paint his race helmets. His father John Medlen was his crew chief. Death On March 19, 2007 during a test session at Gainesville Raceway in Gainesville, Florida, Medlen was critically injured when his Funny Car developed the most severe tire shake ever recorded in a Funny Car. The side-to-side force of the shake caused his head to hit the roll bars around his head, causing severe head injuries.ESPN - NHRA officials say vibration led to Medlen's death - Racing He became unconscious, causing the car to lose control and strike the wall. After being cut free from the car by the NHRA Safety Safari and receiving emergency treatment at the track, Medlen was transferred by Alachua County Fire Rescue to Shands at the University of Florida where he was treated for four days for what doctors characterized as a severe closed head injury. Medlen survived a delicate, three-hour craniectomy procedure to relieve pressure and hemorrhaging on March 20, 2007, but succumbed to complications of diffuse axonal injury three days later after being removed from life support in accordance with his own previously stated wishes. According to auto racing safety expert John Melvin, Medlen was literally shaken to death in the incident. The deflating tire caused an 18-inch movement up and down, which then exerted a force of 40,000 or more pounds as it rotated. He was the first NHRA fatality since 2004, when Top Fuel racer Darrell Russell lost his life in a race, and the first Funny Car driver to lose his life in 30 years. John Force Racing immediately began an investigation into Medlen's death, leading to the development of the Eric Medlen Chassis. Legacy Sonoma Raceway holds the Eric Medlen Ice Cream Social with fans and competitors being able to have ice cream after the final round of qualifying during the track's NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series race. Medlen mentioned that a person can never be unhappy when eating ice cream. The benefit helps local racers in the San Francisco Bay area who race at Sonoma toward a scholarship fund. One major legacy that was left behind by Medlen happened after his death, the NHRA enacted a new safety requirement within the Funny Car division, that states that the roll bars within the car now have to be padded. The roll bars are padded with a heavy foam rubber insulation and wrapped with seven layers of Nomex fabric to make the foam rubber more resistant to fire. This has dramatically reduced the kinds of injuries among drivers that Medlen suffered which ultimately resulted in his death. The project to build a safer car at John Force Racing after his death is called the Eric Medlen Project, with the new chassis often called an Eric Medlen chassis.

Most trust money, which is invested by financial institutions around the City's Royal Exchange,The Royal Exchange is now a shopping centre, while building is itself now owned by the Canadian pension fund OMERS. comes from people saving for retirement.See generally, Andrew Burrows (ed), English Private Law (3rd edn OUP 2013) Part 2, ch 3, D. In 2011, UK pension funds held over ¬£1 trillion of assets, and unit trusts held ¬£583.8 billion.Office for National Statistics, Financial Statistics No 591 (July 2011) Tables 5.1B and 5.3D. Note that open-ended investment companies have been increasingly replacing unit trusts as a preferred managed fund vehicle. English trust law concerns the creation and protection of asset funds, which are usually held by one party for another's benefit.JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) ch 2, 49 Trusts were a creation of the English law of property and obligations, but also share a history with countries across the Commonwealth and the United States. Trusts developed when claimants in property disputes were dissatisfied with the common law courtsThis was mainly the Court of King's Bench and the Common Pleas and petitioned the King for a just and equitable result. On the King's behalf, the Lord Chancellor developed a parallel justice system in the Court of Chancery, commonly referred as equity. Historically, trusts were mostly used where people left money in a will, created family settlements, created charities, or some types of business venture. After the Judicature Act 1873, England's courts of equity and common law were merged, and equitable principles took precedence.See the Earl of Oxford's case (1615) 21 ER 485 and Judicature Act 1873 s 25(11). See now Senior Courts Act 1981 s 49 Today, trusts play an important role in financial investments, especially in unit trusts and pension trusts, where trustees and fund managers usually invest assets for people who wish to save for retirement. Although people are generally free to write trusts in any way they like, an increasing number of statutes are designed to protect beneficiaries, or regulate the trust relationship, including the Trustee Act 1925, Trustee Investments Act 1961, Recognition of Trusts Act 1987, Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, Trustee Act 2000, Pensions Act 1995, Pensions Act 2004 and the Charities Act 2011. Trusts are usually created by a settlor, who gives assets to one or more trustees who undertake to use the assets for the benefit of beneficiaries. As in contract law no formality is required to make a trust, except where statute demands it (e.g. transfers of land, shares, for wills). To protect the settlor, English law demands a reasonable degree of certainty that a trust was intended. To be able to enforce the trust's terms, the courts also require reasonable certainty about which assets were entrusted, and which people were meant to be the trust's beneficiaries. Unlike some offshore tax havens and the United States, English law requires that a trust has at least one beneficiary if it is not charitable. The Charity Commission monitors how charity trustees perform their duties, and ensures charities serve the public interest. Pensions and investment trusts are closely regulated to protect people's savings and ensure that trustees or fund managers are accountable. Beyond these expressly created trusts, English law recognises \\"resulting\\" and \\"constructive\\" trusts that arise by automatic operation of law to prevent unjust enrichment, to correct wrongdoing or to create property rights where intentions are unclear. Although the word \\"trust\\" is used, resulting and constructive trusts are different because they mainly create property-based remedies to protect people's rights, and do not merely flow (like a contract or an express trust) from the consent of the parties. Generally speaking, however, trustees owe a range of duties to their beneficiaries. If a trust document is silent, trustees must avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest, manage the trust's affairs with reasonable care and skill, and only act for purposes consistent with the trust's terms. Some of these duties can be excluded, except where the statute makes duties compulsory, but all trustees must act in good faith in the best interests of the beneficiaries. If trustees breach their duties, the beneficiaries may make a claim for all property wrongfully paid away to be restored, and may trace and follow what was trust property and claim restitution from any third party who ought to have known of the breach of trust. History Statements of equitable principle stretch back to the Ancient Greeks in the work of Aristotle,Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics (350 BC) Book V, pt 10 while examples of rules analogous to trusts were found in the Roman law testamentary institution of the fideicommissum, and the Islamic proprietary institution of the Waqf. However, English trusts law is a largely indigenous development that began in the Middle Ages, from the time of the 11th and 12th century crusades.See generally, JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) ch 1, 5‚Äì18 After William the Conqueror became King in 1066, one \\"common law\\" of England was created. Common law courts regarded property as an indivisible entity, as it had been under Roman law and continental versions of civil law. During the crusades, landowners who went to fight would transfer title to their land to a person they trusted so that feudal services could be performed and received. But many who returned found that the people they entrusted refused to transfer their title deed back.Martin (2012) 9 Sometimes, common law courts would not acknowledge that anybody had rights in the property except the holder of the legal title deeds. So claimants petitioned the King to sidestep the common law courts. The King delegated hearing of petitions to his Lord Chancellor, who established the Court of Chancery as more cases were heard. Where it appeared \\"inequitable\\" (i.e. unfair) to let someone with legal title hold onto land, the Lord Chancellor could declare that the real owner \\"in equity\\" (i.e. in all fairness) was another person, if this is what good conscience dictated.Martin (2012) 6‚Äì8 The Court of Chancery determined that the true \\"use\\" or \\"benefit\\" of property did not belong to the person on the title (or the feoffee who held seisin). The cestui que use, the owner in equity, could be a different person. So English law recognised a split between legal and equitable owner, between someone who controlled title and another for whose benefit the land would be used. It was the beginning of trust law. The same logic was useful for Franciscan friars, who would transfer title of land to others as they were precluded from holding property by their vows of poverty.FW Maitland, Equity (1916) 25. WS Holdsworth, A History of English Law (1923) vol 4, 415 When the courts said that one person's legal title to property was subject to an obligation to use that property for another person, there was a trust. The Star Chamber (est. circa 1398) played the role of a criminal court of \\"equity\\", where judges on the King's authority could impose punishments that deviated from the law.FW Maitland, Equity (1916) Lecture 2, 11, \\"the Court of Chancery was the twin sister of the Court of Star Chamber\\" It was abolished by the Habeas Corpus Act 1640, although in civil matters the Court of Chancery continued operation until 1875.See the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875. During the 15th century and 16th century, \\"uses\\" or \\"trusts\\" were also employed to avoid the payment of feudal taxation. If a person died, the law stated a landlord was entitled to money before the land passed to an heir, and the landlord got all of the property under the doctrine of escheat if there were no heirs. Transferring title to a group of people for common use could ensure this never happened, because if one person died he could be replaced, and it was unlikely for all to die at the same time.Martin (2012) 10 King Henry VIII saw that this deprived the Crown of revenue, and so in the Statute of Uses 1535 he attempted to prohibit uses, stipulating all land belonged in fact to the cestui que use.Martin (2012) 11 Henry VIII also increased the role of the Court of Star Chamber, a court with criminal jurisdiction that invented new rules as it thought fit, and often this was employed against political dissidents. However, when Henry VIII was gone, the Court of Chancery held that the Statute of Uses 1535 had no application where land was leased.Martin (2012) 12 People started entrusting property again for family legacies.FW Maitland, Equity (1916) Lecture 1 Moreover, the primacy of equity over the common law soon was reasserted, and this time supported by King James I in 1615, in the Earl of Oxford's case.(1615) 21 ER 485, 21 ER 588 and Martin (2012) 12‚Äì13 Due to its deep unpopularity the \\"criminal equity\\" jurisdiction was abolished by the Habeas Corpus Act 1640. Trusts grew more popular, and were tolerated by the Crown, as new sources of revenue from the mercantile exploits in the New World decreased the Crown's reliance on feudal dues. By the early 18th century, the use had formalised into a trust:e.g. Hopkins v Hopkins (1739) 1 Atk 581, 591 per Lord Hardwicke where land was settled to be held by a trustee, for the benefit of another, the Courts of Chancery recognised the beneficiary as the true owner in equity.Martin (2012) 13 In his book Bleak House (1853), Charles Dickens pilloried the Court of Chancery's arcane and tedious practices, exemplified in his fictional case of Jarndyce v Jarndyce. Within two decades, Parliament abolished the court, and merged equity with the common law through the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, and its successor Judicature Acts. By the late 17th century, it had become an ever more widely held view that equitable rules and the law of trusts varied unpredictably, as the jurist John Selden remarked, according to the size of the \\"Chancellor's foot\\".See J Selden, Table Talk (1689, republished 1856) 49, \\"Equity is a roguish thing. For Law we have a measure, know what to trust to; Equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is larger or narrower, so is Equity. 'T is all one as if they should make the standard for the measure we call a \\"foot\\" a Chancellor's foot; what an uncertain measure would this be! One Chancellor has a long foot, another a short foot, a third an indifferent foot. 'Tis the same thing in the Chancellor's conscience.\\" Over the 18th century English property law, and trusts with it, mostly came to a standstill in legislation, but the Court of Chancery continued to develop equitable principles notably under Lord Nottingham (from 1673‚Äì1682), Lord King (1725‚Äì1733), Lord Hardwicke (1737‚Äì1756), and Lord Henley (1757‚Äì1766). In 1765, the first Professor of English law, William Blackstone wrote in his Commentaries on the Laws of England that equity should not be seen as a distinct body of rules, separate from the other laws of England. For example, although it was \\"said that a court of equity determines according to the spirit of the rule and not according to the strictness of the letter,\\" wrote Blackstone, \\"so also does a court of law\\" and the result was that each system of courts was attempting to reach \\"the same principles of justice and positive law\\".W Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765) vol III, 429. Described in FW Maitland, Equity (1916) Lecture 2, 12‚Äì14 Blackstone's influence reached far. Chancellors became more concerned to standardise and harmonise equitable principles. At the start of the 19th century in Gee v Pritchard, referring to John Selden's quip, Lord Eldon (1801‚Äì1827) said 'Nothing would inflict upon me greater pain in quitting this place than the recollection that I had done anything to justify the reproach that the equity of this court varies like the Chancellor's foot.'(1818) 2 Swan 402, 414 The Court of Chancery was meant to have mitigated the petty strictnesses of the common law of property. But instead, came to be seen as cumbersome and arcane. This was partly because until 1813, there was only the Lord Chancellor and the Master of the Rolls working as judges. Work was slow. In 1813, a Vice-Chancellor was appointed, in 1841 two more, and in 1851 two Lord Justices of Appeal in Chancery (making seven).FW Maitland, Equity (1916) Lecture 2, 14 But this did not save it from ridicule. In particular, Charles Dickens (1812‚Äì1870), who himself worked as a clerk near Chancery Lane, wrote Bleak House in 1853, depicting a fictional case of Jarndyce v Jarndyce, a Chancery matter about wills that nobody understood and dragged on for years and years.nb Martin (2012) 15, cases in Lord Eldon's court had indeed lasted up to 18 years. Within twenty years, separate courts of equity were abolished. Parliament merged the common law and equity courts into one system with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873. Equitable principles would prevail over common law rules in case of conflict,Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 s 25(11), 'Generally in all matters not herein-before particularly mentioned, in which there is any conflict or variance between the Rules of Equity and the Rules of the Common Law with reference to the same matter, the Rules of Equity shall prevail.' Now found in the Senior Courts Act 1981 s 49 but the separate identity of equity had ended. The separate identity of the trust, however, continued as strongly as before. In other parts of the Commonwealth (or the British Empire at the time) trust law principles, as then understood, were codified for the purpose of easy administration. The best example is the Indian Trusts Act 1882, which described a trust as meaning \\"an obligation annexed to the ownership of property, and arising out of a confidence reposed in and accepted by the bearer\\". Trust law plays a major role in protecting people's occupational pensions, in investments like unit trusts, and in determining \\"equitable\\" ownership when people buy, and live together in, a home. Over the 20th century, trusts came to be used for multiple purposes beyond the classical role of parcelling out wealthy families' estates, wills, or charities. First, as more working-class people became more affluent, they began to be able to save for retirement through occupational pensions.See L Hannah, Inventing Retirement: The development of occupational pensions in Britain (CUP 1986) After the Old Age Pensions Act 1908, everyone who worked and paid National Insurance would probably have access to the minimal state pension, but if people wanted to maintain their living standards, they would need more.See Old Age Pensions Act 1908 ss 1‚Äì2 and Sch 1. Originally, people on less than ¬£31 and 10 shillings a year and were over 70 years old to collect five shillings a week (or ¬£13 a year) from the Post Office. Those with over ¬£21 a year had a reduced benefit. Occupational pensions would typically be constituted through a trust deed, after being bargained for by a trade union under a collective agreement.cf L Hannah, Inventing Retirement: The development of occupational pensions in Britain (1986) ch 3, ‚ÄòThe insurance challenge (1927‚Äì1956)‚Äô After World War Two, the number of people with occupational pensions rose further, and gradually regulation was introduced to ensure that people's \\"pension promise\\" was protected. The settlor would usually be the employer and employee jointly, and the savings would be transferred to a trustee for the benefit of the employee. Most regulation, especially after the Robert Maxwell scandals and the Goode Report,Pension Law Reform (1993) Cm 2342 was directed at ensuring that the employer cannot dominate, or abuse its position through undue influence over the trustee or the trust fund. The second main use of the trust came to be in other financial investments, though not necessarily for retirement. The unit trust, since their launch in 1931, became a popular vehicle for holding \\"units\\" in a fund that would invest in various assets, such as company shares, gilts or government bonds or corporate bonds. One person investing alone might not have much money to spread the risk of his or her investments, and so the unit trust offered an attractive way to pool many investors wealth, and share the profits (or losses). Nowadays, unit trusts have been mostly superseded by Open-ended investment companies, which do much the same thing, but are companies selling shares, rather than trusts. Nevertheless, trusts are widely used, and notorious in offshore trusts in \\"tax havens\\", where people hire an accountant or lawyer to make an argument that shifting assets in some new way will avoid tax. The third main contemporary use of the trust has been in the family home, though not as an expressly declared trust. As gender inequality began to narrow, both partners to a marriage would often be contributing money, or work, to pay the mortgage, make their home, or raise children together. A number of members of the judiciary became active from the late 1960s in declaring that even if one partner was not on the legal title deeds, she or he would still have an equitable property interest in the home under a \\"resulting trust\\" or (more normally today) a \\"constructive trust\\". In essence the courts would acknowledge the existence of a property right, without the trust being expressly declared. Some courts said it reflected an implicit common intention, while others said the use of the trust reflected the need to do justice. In this way, trusts continued to fulfill their historical function of mitigating strict legal rules in the interests of equity. Formation of express trusts National Trust, now a registered charity and endorsed by several Acts of Parliament,e.g. National Trust Act 1907 was established as a trust corporation in 1895, to hold property like Stourhead gardens (pictured) across the UK for the benefit of public recreation. In its essence the word \\"trust\\" applies to any situation where one person holds property on behalf of another, and the law recognises obligations to use the property for the other's benefit.JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) ch 2 The primary situation in which a trust is formed is through the express intentions of a person who \\"settles\\" property. The \\"settlor\\" will give property to someone he trusts (a \\"trustee\\") to use it for someone he cares about (a \\"beneficiary\\"). The law's basic requirement is that a trust was truly \\"intended\\", and that a gift, bailment or agency relationship was not. In addition to requiring certainty about the settlor's intention, the courts suggest the terms of the trust should be sufficiently certain particularly regarding the property and who is to benefit. The courts also have a rule that a trust must ultimately be for people, and not for a purpose, so that if all beneficiaries are in agreement and of full age they may decide how to use the property themselves.See Saunders v Vautier [1841] EWHC Ch J82 The historical trend of construction of trusts is to find a way to enforce them. If, however, the trust is construed as being for a charitable purpose, then public policy is to ensure it is always enforced. Charitable trusts are one of a number of specific trust types, which are regulated by the Charities Act 2006. Very detailed rules also exist for pension trusts, for instance under the Pensions Act 1995, particularly to set out the legal duties of pension trustees, and to require a minimum level of funding. Intention and formality People's wills and testaments, like William Shakespeare's will here, often present difficulties in trust law where the meaning of what is intended is not completely clear. The House of Lords, however, has said a trust should only fail if its meaning is \\"utterly impossible\\" to deduce.Fawcett Properties Ltd v Buckingham County Council [1961] AC 636, 678 per Lord Denning Much like a contract, express trusts are usually formed based on the expressed intentions of a person who owns some property to in future have it managed by a trustee, and used for another person's benefit.JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) ch 3, 98‚Äì101 Often the courts see cases where people have recently died, and expressed a wish to use property for another person, but have not used legal terminology. In principle, this does not matter. In Paul v Constance, Mr Constance had recently split up with his wife, and began to live with Ms Paul, who he played bingo with.[1976] EWCA Civ 2 Because of their close relationship, Mr Constance had often repeated that the money in his bank account, partly from bingo winnings and from a workplace accident, was \\"as much yours as mine\\". When Mr Constance died, his old wife claimed the money still belonged to her, but the Court of Appeal held that despite the lack of formal wording, and though Mr Constance had retained the legal title to the money, it was held on trust for him and Ms Paul. As Scarman LJ put it, they understood \\"very well indeed their own domestic situation\\", and even though legal terms were not used in substance this did \\"convey clearly a present declaration that the existing fund was as much\\" belonging to Ms Paul. As Lord Millett later put it, if someone \\"enters into arrangements which have the effect of creating a trust, it is not necessary that [she or] he should appreciate that they do so.\\"Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley [2002] UKHL 12, [71] The only thing that needs to be done further is that, if the settlor is not declaring herself or himself as the trustee, the property should be physically transferred to the new trustee for the trust to be properly \\"constituted\\". The traditional reason for requiring a transfer of property to the trustee was that the doctrine of consideration demanded that property should be passed, and not just promised at some future date, unless something of value was given in return.On the requirement of transfer for a gift, see for example Thomas v Times Book Co Ltd [1966] 2 All ER 241, where a manuscript for the play Under Milk Wood by Dylan Thomas was held to have been given as a gift when someone took physical possession of it. The general trend in more recent cases, though is to be flexible in these requirements, because as Lord Browne-Wilkinson said, equity \\"will not strive officiously to defeat a gift\\".T Choithram International SA v Pagarani [2000] UKPC 46 Although trusts do not, generally, require any formality to be established, formality may be required in order to transfer property the settlor wishes to entrust.Martin (2012) ch 3, 82‚Äì98 There are six particular situations which have returned to the cases: (1) transfers of company shares require registration,Companies Act 2006 s 554 (2) trusts and transfers of land require writing and registration,Law of Property Act 1925 s 53(1)(b) and Land Registration Act 2002 s 27 (3) transfers (or \\"dispositions\\") of an equitable interest require writing,Law of Property Act 1925 s 53(1)(c) and see Grey v IRC [1960] AC 1 and Re Vandervell's Trusts [1974] Ch 269 (4) wills require writing and witnesses,Wills Act 1837 s 9 (5) gifts that are only to be transferred in the future require deeds,Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 s 1 and (6) bank cheques usually need to be endorsed with a signature.Bills of Exchange Act 1882 s 23. This also depends on the terms of the banking contract, but is fairly standard. The modern view of formal requirements is that their purpose is to ensure the transferring party has genuinely intended to carry out the transaction. As the American lawyer, Lon Fuller, put it the purpose is to provide \\"channels for the legally effective expression of intention\\",L Fuller, 'Consideration and Form' (1941) 41 Columbia Law Review 799, 801 particularly where there's a common danger in large transactions that people could rush into it without thinking. However, older case law saw the courts interpreting the requirements of form very rigidly. In an 1862 case, Milroy v Lord,[1862] EWHC J78 a man named Thomas Medley signed a deed for Samuel Lord to hold 50 Bank of Louisiana shares on trust for his niece, Eleanor Milroy. But the Court of Appeal in Chancery held that this did not create a trust (and nor was any gift effective) because the shares had not finally been registered. Similarly, in an 1865 case, Jones v Lock,(1865) 1 Ch App 25 Lord Cottenham LC held that because a ¬£900 cheque was not endorsed, it could not be counted as being held on trust for his son. This was so even though the father had said \\"I give this to baby... I am going to put it away for him... he may do what he likes with it\\" and locked it in a safe. However, the more modern view, starting with Re Rose[1952] EWCA Civ 4 was that if the transferor had taken sufficient steps to demonstrate their intention for property to be entrusted, then this was enough. Here, Eric Rose had filled out forms to transfer company shares to his wife, and three months later this was entered into the company share register. The Court of Appeal held, however, that in equity the transfer took place when the forms were completed.This meant that a transfer tax had still been in force, under Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1881 s 38(2)(a), Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1889 s 11(1) and the Finance Act 1894 s 2(1)(c) In Mascall v Mascall (1984)[1984] EWCA Civ 10 the Court of Appeal held that, when a father filled out a deed and certificate for the transfer of land, although the transfer had not actually been lodged with HM Land Registry, in equity it the transfer was irrevocable. The trend was confirmed by the Privy Council in T Choithram International SA v Pagarani (2000),[2000] UKPC 46 where a wealthy man publicly declared he would donate a large sum of money to a charitable foundation he had set up, but died before any transfer of the money took place. Although a gift, which is not transferred, was traditionally thought to require a deed to be enforced, the Privy Council advised this was not necessary as the property was already vested in him as a trustee, and his intentions were clear. In the case of \\"secret trusts\\", where someone has written a will but also privately told the executor that they wished to donate their some part of their property in other ways, this has long been held to not contravene the Wills Act 1837 requirements for writing, because it simply works as a declaration of trust before the will.e.g. Re Young [1951] Ch 344, alleged there was a secret trust, but held 'the Wills Act 1837 had nothing to do with the matter'. Older cases had also said such declarations were effective to prevent statutory requirements being used as an instrument of \\"fraud\\". The modern trend, then, has been that so long as the purpose of the formality rules will not be undermined, the courts will not hold trusts invalid. Certainty of subject and beneficiaries Beyond the requirement for a settlor to have truly intended to create a trust, it has been said since at least 1832 that the subject matter of the property, and the people who are to benefit must also be certain. Together, certainty of intention, the certainty of subject matter and beneficiaries have been called the \\"three certainties\\" required to form a trust,See Wright v Atkyns (1832) Turn & R 143, per Lord Eldon and Knight v Knight (1840) 49 ER 58, (1848) 3 Beav 148, per Lord Langdale MR (where not a trust, but simply a gift was construed to be the intention). although the purposes of each \\"certainty\\" are different in kind.JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) ch 3, 97 While certainty of intention (and the formality rules) seek to ensure that the settlor truly intended to benefit another person with his or her property, the requirements of certain subject matter and beneficiaries focus on whether a court will have a reasonable ability to know on what terms the trust should be enforced. As a point of general principle, most courts do not strive to defeat trusts on the basis of uncertainty.See also T Choithram International SA v Pagarani [2001] 2 All ER 492, per Lord Browne-Wilkinson, \\"Although equity will not aid a volunteer, it will not strive officiously to defeat a gift\\". In the case of In re RobertsAlso known as Repington v Roberts-Gawen (1881‚Äì82) LR 19 Ch D 520 a lady named Miss Roberts wrote in her will that she wanted to leave ¬£8753 and 5 shillings worth of bank annuities to her brother and his children who had the surname of \\"Roberts-Gawen\\". Miss Roberts' brother had a daughter who changed her name on marriage, but her son later changed his name back to Roberts-Gawen. At first instance, Hall VC held that, because the grand-nephew's mother had changed the name it was too uncertain that Miss Roberts had wished him to benefit. But on appeal, Lord Jessel MR held that Although in the 19th century a number of courts were overly tentative,e.g. Palmer v Simmonds (1854) 2 Drew 221, where reference to leaving the \\"bulk\\" of an estate on trust was held to be too uncertain, apparently, to be enforced. the modern trend, much like in the law of contract,e.g. WN Hillas & Co Ltd v Arcos Ltd [1932] UKHL 2, per Lord Wright \\"Words are to be so understood that the subject-matter may be preserved rather than destroyed.\\" became as Lord Denning put it: that \\"in cases of contract, as of wills, the courts do not hold the terms void for uncertainty unless it is utterly impossible to put a meaning upon them.\\"Fawcett Properties Ltd v Buckingham County Council [1961] AC 636, 678 For example, in the High Court case of Re Golay's Will Trusts, Ungoed-Thomas J held that a will stipulating that a \\"reasonable income\\" should be paid to the beneficiaries, although the amount was not anywhere specified, could be given a clear meaning and enforced by the court. Courts were, he said, \\"constantly involved in making such objective assessments of what is reasonable\\" and would ensure \\"the direction in the will is not ... defeated by uncertainty.\\"[1965] 1 WLR 969. See also Ottaway v Norman [1972] Ch 698, that \\"floating trusts\\" may be upheld, in contrast to earlier cases such as Boyce v Boyce (1849) 60 ER 959 In the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 the insolvency of Lehman Brothers, whose sign was auctioned here at Christie's, led to a mass of litigation to sort out which bank investors might have sufficiently certain equitable rights in the financial assets, or who would be the unlucky unsecured creditors.See In re Lehman Brothers International [2012] UKSC 6, [2] per Lord Hope. However, the courts have had difficulty in defining appropriate principles for cases where trusts are declared over property that many people have an interest in.Martin (2012) 105‚Äì107 This is especially true where the person who possesses that property has gone insolvent.See initially, Re Wait [1927] 1 Ch 606, where Lord Hanworth MR and Atkin LJ held that 500 tons of wheat held by Wait, but which had not been separated from the rest of the wheat, could not be owned beneficially by a buyer, even though the contract had been concluded. Sergeant LJ dissented. In Re Kayford Ltd[1975] 1 WLR 279 a mail order business went insolvent and customers who had paid for goods wanted their money back. Megarry J held that because Kayford Ltd had put its money in a separate account the money was held on trust, and so the customers were not unsecured creditors. By contrast in Re London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd[1986] PCC 121 Oliver J held that customers who had bought wine bottles were not entitled to take their wine because no particular bottles had been identified for a trust to arise. A similar view was expressed by the Privy Council in Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd,[1994] UKPC 3 where the customers of an insolvent gold bullion reserve business were told that they never had been given particular gold bars, and so were unsecured creditors. These decisions were said to be motivated by the desire to not undermine the statutory priority system in insolvency, although it is not entirely clear why those policy reasons extended to consumers who are usually seen as \\"non-adjusting\\" creditors.See further, LA Bebchuk and JM Freid, 'The Uneasy Case for the Priority of Secured Claims in Bankruptcy' (1996) 105 Yale LJ 857, 881‚Äì890 However, in the leading Court of Appeal decision, Hunter v Moss,[1993] EWCA Civ 11 there was no insolvency issue. There, Moss had declared himself to be a trustee of 50 out of 950 shares he held in a company, and Hunter sought to enforce this declaration. Dillon LJ held that it did not matter that the 50 particular shares had not been identified or isolated, and they were held on trust.Barlow Clowes International Ltd v Vaughan [1992] 4 All ER 22, per Dillon LJ, recounting the case worked on the presumption that 'the assets and moneys in question are trust moneys held on trust for all or some of the would-be investors ... who paid moneys to BCI or associated bodies for investment, and are not general assets of BCI.' Here, contributors to a collective investment fund, where money was pooled, sought a declaration of how losses to the fund should be shared, whether pro rata or otherwise. The same result was reached, however, in an insolvency decision by Neuberger J in the High Court, called Re Harvard Securities Ltd,[1997] EWHC Comm 371 where clients of a brokerage company were held to have had an equitable property interest in share capital held for them as a nominee. The view that appears to have been adopted is that if assets are \\"fungible\\" (i.e. swapping them with other will not make much difference) a declaration of trust can be made, so long as the purpose of the statutory priority rules in insolvency are not compromised.See In re Lehman Brothers International [2012] UKSC 6 The final \\"certainty\\" the courts require is to know to some reasonable degree who the beneficiaries are to be.Martin (2012) ch 3, 107‚Äì121 Again, the courts have become increasingly flexible, and intend to uphold the trust if at all possible. In Re Gulbenkian's Settlements (1970)[1970] AC 508 a wealthy Ottoman oil businessman and co-founder of the Iraq Petroleum Company, Calouste Gulbenkian, had left a will giving his trustees \\"absolute discretion\\" to pay money to his son Nubar Gulbenkian, and family, but then also anyone with whom Nubar had \\"from time to time [been] employed or residing\\". This provision of the will was challenged (by the other potential beneficiaries, who wanted more themselves) as being too uncertain in regard to who the beneficiaries were meant to be. The House of Lords held that the will was still entirely valid, because even though one might not be able to draw up a definite list of everybody, the trustees and a court could be sufficiently certain, with evidence of anyone who \\"did or did not\\" employ or house Nubar. Similarly, this \\"is or is not test\\" was applied in McPhail v Doulton.[1970] UKHL 1 Mr Betram Baden created a trust for the employees, relatives and dependants of his company, but also giving the trustees \\"absolute discretion\\" to determine who this was. The settlement was challenged (by the local council that would receive the remainder) on the ground that the idea of \\"relatives\\" and \\"dependants\\" was too uncertain. The House of Lords held the trust was clearly valid because a court could exercise the relevant power, and would do so \\"to give effect to the settlor's or testator's intentions.\\" Unfortunately, when the case was remitted to the lower courts to determine what in fact the settlor's intentions were, in Re Baden's Deed Trusts,[1973] Ch 9 the judges in the Court of Appeal could not agree. All agreed the trust was sufficiently certain, but Sachs LJ thought it was only necessary to show that there was a \\"conceptually certain\\" class of beneficiaries, however small, and Megaw LJ thought a class of beneficiaries had to have \\"at least a substantial number of objects\\", while Stamp LJ believed that the court should restrict the definition of \\"relative\\" or \\"dependant\\" to something clear, such as \\"next of kin\\". The Court of Appeal in Re Tuck's Settlement Trusts[1977] EWCA Civ 11 was more clear. An art publisher who had Jewish background, Baronet Adolph Tuck, wished to create a trust for people who were \\"of Jewish blood\\". Because of mixing of faiths and ancestors over generations, this could have meant a very large number of people, but in the view of Lord Denning MR the trustees could simply decide. Also the will had stated that the Chief Rabbi of London could resolve any doubts, and so it was valid for a second reason. Lord Russell agreed,[1978] Ch 49, 65, \\"The learned Judge indicated that he would have found the condition too uncertain but for the reference to the Rabbis. I do not so find it.\\" although on this point Eveleigh LJ dissented, and stated that the trust was only valid with Rabbi clause. Divergent views in some cases continued. In Re Barlow's Will Trusts,[1979] 1 WLR 278 Browne-Wilkinson J held that concepts (like \\"friend\\") could always be restricted, as a last resort, to prevent a trust failing. By contrast in one highly political case, a High Court judge found that the West Yorkshire County Council's plan to make a discretionary trust to distribute ¬£400,000 \\"for the benefit of any or all of the inhabitants\\" of West Yorkshire, with the aim to inform people about the effects of the council's impending abolition by Margaret Thatcher's government,See the Local Government (Interim Provisions) Act 1984 and the Local Government Act 1985 failed because it was (apparently) \\"unworkable\\".R (West Yorkshire MCC) v District Auditor No 3 Audit District of West Yorkshire MCC [1986] RVR 24, [2001] WTLR 785 It remained unclear whether some courts' attachment to strict certainty requirements was consistent with the principles of equitable flexibility. Beneficiary principle People have a general freedom, subject to statutory requirements and basic fiduciary duties, to design the terms of a trust in the way a settlor deems fit. However English courts have long refused to enforce trusts that only serve an abstract purpose, and are not for the benefit of people.See the old decision of Lord Eldon in Morice v Bishop of Durham (1805) 10 Ves 522 Only charitable trusts, defined by the Charities Act 2011, and about four other small exceptions will be enforced.See JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) ch 14, 391‚Äì420 The main reason for this judicial policy is to prevent, as Roxburgh J said in Re Astor's Settlement Trusts, \\"the creation of large funds devoted to non-charitable purposes which no court and no department of state can control\\".[1952] Ch 534 This followed a similar policy to the rule against perpetuities, which rendered void any trust that would only be transferred to (or \\"vest\\") in someone in the distant future (currently 125 years under the Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 2009).Martin (2012) ch 14, 395‚Äì398 In both ways, the view has remained strong that the wishes of the dead should not, so to speak, rule the living from the grave.cf LM Simes, Public Policy and the Dead Hand (University of Michigan Press 1955) It would mean that society's resources and wealth would be tied into uses that (because they were not charitable) failed to serve contemporary needs, and therefore made everyone poorer. Re Astor's ST itself concerned the wish of the Viscount Waldorf Astor, who had owned The Observer newspaper, to maintain \\"good understanding... between nations\\" and \\"the independence and integrity of newspapers\\".See also Re Shaw [1957] 1 WLR 729, Harman J held that a trust set up by the playwright George Bernard Shaw to investigate the introduction of a new 40 letter alphabet could not be enforced. While perhaps laudable, it was not within the tightly defined categories of a charity, and so was not valid. An example of a much less laudable aim in Brown v Burdett was an old lady's demand in her will that her house be boarded up for 20 years with \\"good long nails to be bent down on the inside\\", but for some reason with her clock remaining inside. Bacon VC cancelled the trust altogether.(1882) 21 Ch D 667 But while there is a policy against enforcing trusts for abstract and non-charitable purposes, if possible the courts will construe a trust as being for people where they can. For example, in Re Bowes[1896] 1 Ch 507 an aristocrat named John Bowes left ¬£5000 in his will for \\"planting trees for shelter on the Wemmergill estate\\", in County Durham. This was an extravagantly large sum of money for trees. But rather than holding it void (since planting trees on private land was a non- charitable purpose) North J construed the trust to mean that the money was really intended for the estate owners. Similarly in Re Osoba, the Court of Appeal held that a trust of a Nigerian man, Patrick Osoba, said to be for the purpose of \\"training of my daughter\\" was not an invalid purpose trust. Instead it was in substance intended that the money be for the daughter. Buckley LJ said the court would treat \\"the reference to the purpose as merely a statement of the testator's motive in making the gift\\".See also Re Denley's Trust Deed [1969] 1 Ch 373, per Goff J, that there would only be a purpose trust \\"where that benefit is so indirect or intangible... as not to give those persons any locus standi to apply to the court to enforce the trust\\". Under the Hague Trust Convention, ratified by the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987, UK law voluntarily recognises almost all trusts created overseas, in tax havens such as Bermuda, even if there are lower standards for transparency, use of assets, no requirement of beneficiaries, or nominal tax. There are commonly said to be three (or maybe fourThe fourth case, which has been debated as being a trust for a \\"purpose\\" is a Quistclose trust, where a person gives property to another to use for some purpose, but if it fails, the property returns to the initial transferor. However this was held to have been a resulting trust in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley [2002] UKHL 12, by Lord Millett.) small exceptions to the rule against enforcing non-charitable purpose trusts, and there is one certain and major loophole. First, trusts can be created for building and maintaining graves and funeral monuments.e.g. Re Hooper [1932] 1 Ch 38 Second, trusts have been allowed for the saying of private masses.Bourne v Keane [1919] AC 815 Third, it was (long before the Hunting Act 2004) said to lawful to have a trust promoting fox hunting.Re Thompson [1934] Ch 342 These \\"exceptions\\" were said to be fixed in Re Endacott,[1959] EWCA Civ 5 where a minor businessman in who lived in Devon wanted to entrust money \\"for the purpose of providing some useful memorial to myself\\". Lord Evershed MR held this invalid because it was not a grave, let alone charitable. It has, however, been questioned whether the existing categories are in fact true exceptions given that graves and masses could be construed as trusts which ultimately benefit the landowner, or the relevant church.D Hayton and C Mitchell, Cases and materials on the law of trusts and equitable remedies (2010) 189‚Äì190 In any case the major exception to the no purpose trust rule is that in many other common law countries, particularly the United States and a number of Caribbean states, they can be valid. If capital is entrusted under the rules of other jurisdictions the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987 Schedule 1, articles 6 and 18 requires that the trusts are recognised. This follows the Hague Trust Convention of 1985, which was ratified by 12 countries. The UK recognises any offshore trusts unless they are \\"manifestly incompatible with public policy\\". Even trusts in countries that are \\"offshore financial centres\\" (typically described as \\"tax havens\\" because wealthy individuals or corporations shift their assets there to avoid paying taxes in the UK), purpose trusts can be created which serve no charitable function, or any function related to the good of society, so long as the trust document specifies someone to be an \\"enforcer\\" of the trust document. These include Jersey, the Isle of Man, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands.e.g. Bermuda Trusts (Special Provisions) Act 1989 ss 12A and 12B It is argued, for example by David Hayton, a former UK academic trust lawyer who was recruited to serve on the Caribbean Court of Justice, that having an enforcer resolves any problem of ensuring that the trust is run accountably. This substitutes for the oversight that beneficiaries would exercise.e.g. D Hayton, 'Developing the obligation characteristic of the trust' (2001) 117 LQR 96 The result, it is argued, is that English law's continued prohibition on non- charitable purpose trusts is antiquated and ineffective, and is better removed so that money remains \\"onshore\\". This would also have the consequence, like in the US or the tax haven jurisdictions, that public money would be used to enforce trusts over vast sums of wealth which might never do anything for a living person. Associations While express trusts in a family, charity, pension or investment context are typically created with the intention of benefiting people, property held by associations, particularly those which are not incorporated, was historically problematic. Often associations did not express their property to be held in any particular way and courts had theorised that it was held on trust for the members.JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) ch 14, 404‚Äì409 At common law, associations such as trade unions, political parties, or local sports clubs were formed through an express or implicit contract, so long as \\"two or more persons [are] bound together for one or more common purposes\\".Conservative and Unionist Central Office v Burrell [1982] 1 WLR 522. Lawton LJ also added that association members can often join or leave at will, but this requirement is not necessarily accurate in every association on a normal contractual analysis. In Leahy v Attorney-General for New South Wales; . Viscount Simonds in the Privy Council, advised that if property is transferred, for example by gift, to an unincorporated association it is \\"nothing else than a gift to its members at the date of the gift as joint tenants or tenants in common.\\" He said that if property were deemed to be held on trust for future members, this could be void for violating the rule against perpetuities, because an association could last long into the future, and so the courts would generally deem current members to be the appropriate beneficiaries who would take the property on trust for one another. In the English property law concept, \\"joint tenancy\\" meant that people own the whole of a body of assets together, while \\"tenancy in common\\" meant that people could own specific fractions of the property in equity (though not lawUnder the Law of Property Act 1925 ss 1(6), 34(2) and 36(2), a maximum of four people can be joint tenants in law, while any further owners will be tenant in common in equity. This is thought to ensure property is more marketable, because then to make a sale only four people need to be dealt with.). If that was true, a consequence would have been that property was held on trust for members of an association, and those members were beneficiaries. It would have followed that when members left an association, their share could not be transferred to the other members without violating the requirement of writing in the Law of Property Act 1925 section 53(1) for the transfer of a beneficial interest: a requirement that was rarely fulfilled. the Greens, are typically thought to hold property according to the terms of the contract of association. Property is held on trust by the treasurer for the members as a whole.See Hanchett‚ÄêStamford v Attorney‚ÄêGeneral [2009] Ch 173 Another way of thinking about associations' property, that came to be the dominant and practical view,Martin (2012) ch 14 was first stated by Brightman J in Re Recher's Will Trusts.[1972] Ch 526 Here it was said that, if no words are used that indicate a trust is intended, a \\"gift takes effect in favour of the existing members of the association as an accretion to the funds which are the subject-matter of the contract\\". In other words, property will be held according to the members' contractual terms of their association. This matters for deciding whether a gift will succeed or be held to fail, although that possibility is unlikely on any contemporary view.See Re Lipinski's Will Trusts [1976] Ch 235 It also matters where an association is being wound up, and there is a dispute over who should take the remaining property. In a recent decision, Hanchett‚ÄêStamford v Attorney‚ÄêGeneral[2009] Ch 173 Lewison J held that the final surviving member of the \\"Performing and Captive Animals Defence League\\" was entitled to the remaining property of the association, although while the association was running any money could not be used for the members' private purposes. On the other hand, if money is donated to an organisation, and specifically intended to be passed onto others, then the end of an association could mean that remaining assets will go back to the people the money came from (on \\"resulting trust\\") or be bona vacantia. In Re West Sussex Constabulary's Widows, Children and Benevolent (1930) Fund Trusts,[1971] Ch 1 Goff J held that a fund set up for the dependants of police staff, which was being wound up, which had been given money expressly for reason of benefiting dependants (and not to benefit the members of the trust) could not be taken by those members. The rules have also mattered, however for the purpose of taxation. In Conservative and Unionist Central Office v Burrell[1982] 1 WLR 522 it was held that the Conservative Party, and its various limbs and branches, was not all bound together by a contract, and so not subject to corporation tax. Charitable trusts Charitable trusts are a general exception to the rule in English law that trusts cannot be created for an abstract purpose.JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) ch 15 The meaning of a charity has been set in statute since the Elizabethan Charitable Uses Act 1601, but the principles are now codified by the Charities Act 2011. Apart from being capable of not having any clear beneficiaries, charitable trusts usually enjoy exemption from taxation on its own capital or income, and people making gifts can deduct the gift from their taxes.See Income Tax Act 2007 s 527 and Finance Act 2010 s 30 and Sch 6. Martin (2012) 427‚Äì428 Classically, a trust would be charitable if its purpose was promoting reduction of poverty, advancement of education, advancement or religion, or other purposes for the public benefit. The criterion of \\"public benefit\\" was the key to being a charity. Courts gradually added specific examples, today codified in the CA 2011 section 3, section 4 emphasises that all purposes must be for the \\"public benefit\\". The meaning remains with the courts. In Oppenheim v Tobacco Securities Trust the House of Lords held that an employer's trust for his employees and children was not for the public benefit because of the personal relationship between them.[1950] UKHL 2, [1951] AC 297 Generally, the trust must be for a \\"sufficient section of the public\\" and cannot exclude the poor.Re Macduff [1896] 2 Ch 451, 464, per Lindley LJ However it often unclear how these principles are applicable in practice. Because beneficiaries can rarely enforce charitable trustee standards, the Charities Commission is a statutory body whose role is to promote good practice and pre-empt poor charitable management.See Charities Act 2011 ss 13‚Äì21 Pension trusts Pension trusts are the most economically significant kind of trust, as they compose over ¬£1 trillion worth of retirement savings in the UK.Office for National Statistics, Financial Statistics No 591 (July 2011) Tables 5.1B. Partly because of this, and also because occupational pension savers pay for their retirement through their work, the regulation of pensions differs considerable from general trust law.D Hayton, 'Pension Trusts and Traditional Trusts: Drastically Different Species of Trusts‚Äô [2005] Conveyancer 229 The interpretation and construction of a pension trust deed must comply with the basic term of mutual trust and confidence in the employment relationship.Imperial Group Pension Trust v Imperial Tobacco Ltd [1991] 1 WLR 589 Employees are entitled to be informed by their employer about how to make the best of their pension rights.Scally v Southern Health and Social Services Board [1992] 1 AC 294, cf Crossley v Faithful & Gould Holdings Ltd [2004] EWCA Civ 293 Moreover, workers must be treated equally, on grounds of gender or otherwise, in their pension entitlements.Bilka-Kaufhaus GmbH v Weber von Hartz (1986) C-170/84, [1986] IRLR 317; Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance Group (1990) C-262/88, [1990] IRLR 240 The management of a pension trust must be partly codetermined by the pension beneficiaries, so that a minimum of one third of a trustee board are elected or \\"member nominated trustees\\".PA 2004 ss 241‚Äì242. Nomination can be through a direct vote or trade union appointment. This recommendation in law began with the Goode Report, Pension Law Reform (1993) Cm 2342 The Secretary of State has the power by regulation, as yet unused, to increase the minimum up to one half.PA 2004 s 243 Trustees are charged with the duty to manage the fund in the best interests of the beneficiaries, in a way that reflects their general preferences,See Harries v The Church Commissioners for England [1992] 1 WLR 1241 and see the Law Commission, Fiduciary Duties of Investment Intermediaries (2014) Law Com No 350, Part 6 by investing the savings in company shares, bonds, real estate or other financial products. There is a strict prohibition on the misapplication of any assets.See Bishopsgate Investment Management Ltd v Maxwell [1993] BCLC 814 Unlike the general position for a trustee's duty of care, the Pensions Act 1995 section 33 stipulates that trustee investment duties may not be excluded by the trust deed.PA 1995 s 33 Every jobholder will from 2012 be automatically enrolled in an occupational pension, and can codetermine how their retirement savings are invested and their voice in company shares is used.See Pensions Act 2008 and Pensions Act 2004 ss 241‚Äì243 Because pension schemes save up significant amounts of money, which many people rely on in retirement, protection against an employer's insolvency, or dishonesty, or risks from the stock market were seen as necessary after the 1992 Robert Maxwell scandal.Goode Report, Pension Law Reform (1993) Cm 2342 Defined contribution funds must be administered separately, not subject to an employer's undue influence. The Insolvency Act 1986 also requires that outstanding pension contributions are a preferential over creditors, except those with fixed security.IA 1986 ss 175, 386 and Sch 6 However, defined benefit schemes are also meant to insure everyone has a stable income regardless of whether they live a shorter or longer period after retirement.On the scope of regulation, see Houldsworth v Bridge Trustees Ltd [2011] UKSC 42 The Pensions Act 2004 sections 222 to 229 require that pension schemes have a minimum \\"statutory funding objective\\", with a statement of \\"funding principles\\", whose compliance is periodically evaluated by actuaries, and shortfalls are made up. The Pensions Regulator is the non-departmental body which is meant to oversee these standards, and compliance with trustee duties,Pensions Act 2004 ss 13‚Äì32 which cannot be excluded.Pensions Act 1995 s 33 However, in The Pensions Regulator v Lehman Brothers[2013] UKSC 52 the Supreme Court concluded that if the Pensions Regulator issued a \\"Financial Support Direction\\" to pay up funding, and it was not paid when a company had gone insolvent, this ranked like any other unsecured debt in insolvency, and did not have priority over banks that hold floating charges. In addition, there exists a Pensions Ombudsman who may hear complaints and take informal action against employers who fall short of their statutory duties.Pension Schemes Act 1993, s 163 If all else fails, the Pension Protection Fund guarantees a sum is ensured, up to a statutory maximum.Pensions Act 2004 ss 173‚Äì174 and Sch 7 Investment and taxation On Throgmorton Avenue is the London office of the world's largest fund manager, BlackRock.

But compare W Swadling, 'Explaining Resulting Trusts' (2008) 124 LQR 72. While express trusts arise primarily because of a conscious plan that settlors, trustees or beneficiaries consent to, courts also impose trusts to correct wrongs and reverse unjust enrichment. The two main types of imposed trusts, known as \\"resulting\\" and \\"constructive\\" trusts, do not necessarily respond to any intentional wishes. There is significant academic debate over why they arise. Traditionally, the explanation was this was to prevent people acting \\"unconscionably\\" (i.e. inequitably or unjustly). Modern authors increasingly prefer to categorise resulting and constructive trusts more precisely, as responding to wrongs, unjust enrichments, sometimes consent or contributions in family home cases. In these contexts, the word \\"trust\\" still denotes the proprietary remedy, but resulting and constructive trusts usually do not come from complete agreements.See P Birks, 'Equity, conscience, and unjust enrichment' (1999) 23 Melbourne University LR 1 and A Burrows, 'We do this at common law but that in equity' (2002) 22 OJLS 1 Having a property right is usually most important if a defendant is insolvent, because then the \\"beneficiaries\\" under resulting or constructive rank in priority to the defendants' other creditors: they can take the property away first. Generally, resulting trusts are imposed by courts when a person receives property, but the person who transferred it did not have the intention for them to benefit. English law establishes a presumption that people do not desire to give away property unless there is some objective manifestation of consent to do so. Without positive evidence of an intention to transfer property, a recipient holds property under a resulting trust. Constructive trusts arise in around ten different circumstances. Though the list is debated, potentially the courts will \\"construe\\" a person to hold property for another person, first, to complete a consent based obligations, particularly those lacking formality, second, to reflect a person's contribution to the value of property, especially in a family home, third, to effect a remedy for wrongdoing such as when a trustee makes a secret profit, and fourth, to reverse unjust enrichment. Resulting trusts A resulting trust is usually recognised when one person has given property to another person without the intention to benefit them.nb the term \\"resulting\\" trust comes from the Latin word, resultare meaning to \\"spring back\\". See JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) 251 ff The recipient will be declared by the court to be a \\"resulting trustee\\" so that the equitable property right returns to the person it came from. For some time, the courts of equity required proof of a positive intention before they would acknowledge the passing of a gift, primarily as a way to prevent fraud.e.g. Ryall v Ryall (1739) 1 Atk 59 If one person transferred property to another, unless there was positive evidence that it was meant to be a gift, it would be presumed that the recipient held the property on trust for the transferee. It was also recognised that if money was transferred as part of the purchase of land or a house, the transferee would acquire an equitable interest in the land under a resulting trust.e.g. Dyer v Dyer (1788) 2 Cox 92 On the other hand, if evidence clearly showed a gift was intended, then a gift would be acknowledged. In Fowkes v Pascoe,(1875) LR 10 Ch App 343 an old lady named Mrs Baker had bought Mr Pascoe some company stocks, because she had become endeared to him and treated him like a grandson. When she died, the executor, Mr Fowkes, argued that Mr Pascoe held the stocks on resulting trust for the estate, but the Court of Appeal said the fact that the lady had put the stocks in Mr Pascoe's name was absolutely conclusive. The presumption of a resulting trust was rebutted. If there is no evidence either way of intention to benefit someone with a property transfer, the presumption of a resulting trust is transferred is not absolute. The Law of Property Act 1925 section 60(3) states that a resulting trust does not arise simply with absence of an express intention. However, the presumption is strong. This has a consequence when property is transferred in connection with an illegal purpose. Ordinarily, English law takes the view that one cannot rely in civil claims on actions done that are tainted with illegality (or in the Latin saying ex turpi causa non oritur actio).See Holman v Johnson (1775) 1 Cowp 341, 343 However, in Tinsley v Milligan,[1994] 1 AC 340 it was still possible for a claimant, Ms Milligan, to show she had an equitable interest in the house where she and her partner, Ms Tinsley, lived because she had contributed to the purchase price. Ms Tinsley was the sole registered owner, and both had intended to keep things this way because with one person on the title, they could fraudulently claim more in social security benefits. The House of Lords held, however, that because a resulting trust was presumed by the law, Ms Milligan did not need to prove an intention to not benefit Ms Tinsley, and therefore rely on her intention that was tainted with an illegal purpose. By contrast, the law has historically stated that when a husband transfers property to his wife (but not vice versa) or when parents make transfers to their children, a gift is presumed (or there is a \\"presumption of advancement\\"). This presumption has been criticised on the ground that it is essentially sexist,e.g. C Webb, Trusts Law (3rd edn 2013) 172 or at least \\"belonging to the propertied classes of a different social era.\\"Pettitt v Pettitt [1970] AC 777, 824, Lord Diplock It could be thought to follow that if Milligan had been a man and married to Tinsley, then the case's outcome would be the opposite. One limitation, however, came in Tribe v Tribe.[1996] Ch 107 Here a father transferred company shares to his son with a view to putting them out of reach of his creditors. This created a presumption of advancement. His son then refused to give the shares back, and the father argued in court that he had plainly not intended the son should benefit. Millett LJ held that because the illegal plan (to defraud creditorsSee the Insolvency Act 1986 s 435, stating that transactions defrauding creditors are void) had not been put into effect, the father could prove he had not intended to benefit his son by referring to the plan. Depending on what an appellate court would now decide, the presumption of advancement may remain a part of the law. The Equality Act 2010 section 199 would abolish the presumption of advancement, but the section's implementation was delayed indefinitely by the Conservative led coalition government when it was elected in 2010. In 1910 Frederic Maitland, in his famous lectures on Equity,FW Maitland, AH Chaytor and WJ Whittaker (eds), Equity (1910, reprinted 1916) 79 described resulting trusts as follows: \\"I have made a trustee for somebody, and a trustee he must be ‚Äì if for no one else then for me or my representatives\\". It remains controversial whether they respond to unjust enrichment,See C Mitchell, Trusts and Equitable Remedies (2010) 612‚Äì613. This view was indirectly endorsed by Lord Millett in Air Jamaica Ltd v Charlton or what would have been intended by the parties.This view was endorsed by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC [1996] AC 669, but seems hard to square with Vandervell v IRC [1967] 2 AC 29, where Mr Vandervell positively did not want to have a share option result back to him, yet it did anyway. As well as resulting trusts, where the courts have presumed that the transferor would have intended the property return, there are resulting trusts which arise by automatic operation of the law. A key example is where property is transferred to a trustee, but too much is handed over. The surplus will be held by the recipient on a resulting trust. For example, in the Privy Council case of Air Jamaica Ltd v Charlton[1999] 1 WLR 1399 an airline's pension plan was overfunded, so that all employees could be paid the benefits that they were due under their employment contracts, but a surplus remained. The company argued that it should receive the money, because it had attempted to amend the scheme's terms, and the Jamaican government argued that it should receive the money, as bona vacantia because the scheme's original terms had stated money was not to return to the company, and the employees had all received their entitlements. However, the Privy Council advised both were wrong and the money should return to those who had made contributions to the fund: half the company and half the employees, on resulting trust. This was in response, according to Lord Millett, \\"to the absence of any intention on his part to pass a beneficial interest to the recipient.\\"Air Jamaica Ltd v Charlton [1999] UKPC 20, [45] In a similar pattern, it was held in Vandervell v Inland Revenue Commissioners that an option to repurchase shares in a company was held on resulting trust for Mr Vandervell when he declared the option to be held by his family trustees, but did not say who he meant the option to be held on trust for.[1967] 2 AC 291 Mr Vandervell had been trying to make a gift of ¬£250,000 to the Royal College of Surgeons without paying any transfer tax, and thought that he could do it if he transferred the College some shares in his company, let the company pay out enough dividends, and then bought the shares back. However, the Income Tax Act 1952 section 415(2),Subsequently reenacted in ICTA 1988 ss 684‚Äì685, and now found in Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 s 624 applied a tax to a settlor of a trust for any income made out of trusts, if the settlor retained any interest whatsoever. Because Mr Vandervell did not say who the option was meant to be for, the House of Lords concluded the option was held on trust for him, and therefore he was taxed. It has also been said, that trusts which arise when one person gives property to another for a reason, but then the reason fails, as in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd[1970] AC 567 are resulting in nature. However, Lord Millett in his judgment in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley' ',[2002] 2 AC 164(dissenting on the knowing receipt point, leading on the Quistclose point) recategorised the trust which arises as an immediate express trust for the benefit of the transferor, albeit with a mandate upon the recipient to apply the assets for a purpose stated in the contract.. See also, P Birks, Unjust Enrichment (2005) 197 Considerable disagreement exists about why resulting trusts arise, and also the circumstances in which they ought to, since it carries property rights rather than simply a personal remedy. The most prominent academic view is that resulting trust respond to unjust enrichment.For example, see P Birks, Unjust enrichment (2nd edn Clarendon 2005) chs 7 and 8 However, this analysis was rejected in the controversial speech of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC.[1996] AC 669 This case involved a claim by the Westdeutsche bank for its money back from Islington council with compound interest. The bank gave the council money under an interest rate swap agreement, but these agreements were found to be unlawful and ultra vires for councils to enter into by the House of Lords in 1992 in Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC[1992] 2 AC 1 partly because the transactions were speculative, and partly because councils were effectively exceeding their borrowing powers under the Local Government Act 1972. There was no question about whether the bank could recover the principal sum of its money, now that these agreements were void, but at the time the courts did not have jurisdiction to award compound interest (rather than simple interest) unless a claimant showed they were making a claim for property that they owned. So, to get more interest back, the bank contended that when money was transferred under the ultra vires agreement, a resulting trust arose immediately in its favour, giving it a property right, and therefore a right to compound interest. The minority of the House of Lords, Lord Goff and Lord Woolf, held that the bank should have no proprietary claim, but they should nevertheless be awarded compound interest. This view was actually endorsed 12 years later by the House of Lords in Sempra Metals Ltd v IRC[2008] AC 561, by a majority so that the courts can award compound interest on debts that are purely personal claims. However, the majority in Westdeutsche held that the bank was not entitled to compound interest at all, particularly because there was no resulting trust. Lord Browne-Wilkinson's reasoning was that only if a recipient's conscience were affected, could a resulting trust arise. It followed that because the council could not have known that its transactions were ultra vires until the 1992 decision in Hazell, its \\"conscience\\" could not be affected. Theoretically this was controversial because it was unnecessary to reject that resulting trusts respond to unjust enrichment in order to deny that a proprietary remedy should be given.See P Birks, 'Misnomer' in W Cornish, R Nolan, J O'Sullivan (eds), Restitution: Past, Present and Future: Essays in Honour of Gareth Jones (1998) and P Birks, ‚ÄòEquity, conscience, and unjust enrichment‚Äô (1999) 23 Melbourne University Law Review 1 Not all unjust enrichment claims necessarily require proprietary remedies, while it does appear that explaining resulting trusts as a response to whatever good \\"conscience\\" requires is not especially enlightening. Constructive trusts Although resulting trusts are generally thought to respond to an absence of an intention to benefit another person when property is transferred, and the growing view is that underlying this is a desire to prevent unjust enrichment, there is less agreement about \\"constructive trusts\\". At least since 1677,See Ford Lord Grey v Katherine Lady Grey (1677) 2 Swanston 594, 36 ER 742 constructive trusts have been recognised in English courts in about seven to twelve circumstances (depending on how the counting and categorisation is doneCompare JE Martin, Modern Equity (19th edn 2012) 325 ff, finding around 10 categories; C Mitchell, Cases and materials on the law of trusts and equitable remedies (2010) 624, counting 12 categories; and C Webb, Trust Law (2013) ch 9, counting 7 or so categories.). Because constructive trusts were developed by the Court of Chancery, it was historically said that a trust was \\"construed\\" or imposed by the court on someone who acquired property, whenever good conscience required it. In the US case, Beatty v Guggenheim Exploration Co,(1919) 225 NY 380, 386 Cardozo J remarked that the \\"constructive trust is the formula through which the conscience of equity finds expression. When property has been acquired in such circumstances that the holder of the legal title may not in good conscience retain the beneficial interest, equity converts him into a trustee.\\" However, this did not say what underlay the seemingly different situations where constructive trusts were found. In Canada, the Supreme Court at one point held that all constructive trusts responded to someone being \\"unjustly enriched\\" by coming to hold another person's property,Deglman v Guaranty Trust Co [1954] SCR 725 but it later changed its mind,Korkontzilas v Soulos [1997] 2 SCR 217 given that property could come to be held when it was unfair to keep through other means, particularly a wrong or through an incomplete consensual obligation.See Mitchell (2010) 668 It is generally accepted that constructive trusts have been created for reasons, and so the more recent debate has therefore turned on which constructive trusts should be considered as arising to perfect a consent based obligation (like a contract), which ones arise in response to wrongdoing (like a tort) and which ones (if any) arise in response to unjust enrichment, or some other reasons. Consents, wrongs, unjust enrichments, and miscellaneous other reasons are usually seen as being at least three of the main categories of \\"event\\" that give rise to obligations in English law, and constructive trusts may straddle all of them.See P Birks, 'Rights, wrongs and remedies' (2000) 20 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 1. In Roman law Gaius, Digest 44.7.1, stated that obligations arose from contracts, delicts, and miscellaneous other reasons. The law of \\"unjust enrichment\\" was carved out as an autonomous category, with its own logic, from the miscellaneous reasons over the 19th and 20th century. See Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd [1988] UKHL 12 Commentaries (1765) William Blackstone argued all causes of actions were founded on wrongs to protect rights. Constructive trusts, however, are usually argued to arise to perfect consent based obligations, to provide a proprietary remedy for wrongdoing, to reverse unjust enrichment, and to reflect the contributions of work that people make, especially in family homes. The constructive trusts that are usually seen as responding to consent (for instance, like a commercial contract), or \\"intention\\" are, first, agreements to convey property where all the formalities have not yet been completed.Mitchell (2010) 665 Under the doctrine of anticipation, if an agreement could be specifically enforced, before formalities are completed the agreement to transfer a property is regarded as effective in equity,In Walsh v Lonsdale, a landlord and tenant had agreed on a lease for 7 years and the tenant had moved in, but the agreement had not been made by deed, as was needed. When the landlord sued for rent for the remaining term, Lord Jessel MR held that the agreement was valid in equity immediately in \\"anticipation\\" of formalities, and so the landlord had a valid claim. and the property will be held on trust (unless this is expressly excluded by the agreement's terms).Jerome v Kelly [2004] 1 WLR 1409 Second, when someone agrees to use property for another's benefit, or divide a property after purchase,See also Pallant v Morgan [1953] 1 Ch 43 and Banner Homes Group plc v Luff Developments Ltd [2000] Ch 372 but then goes back on the agreement, the courts will impose a constructive trust. In Binions v Evans[1972] EWCA Civ 6 when Mr and Mrs Binions bought a large property they promised the sellers that Mrs Evans could remain for life in her cottage. They subsequently tried to evict Mrs Evans, but Lord Denning MR held that their agreement had created a constructive trust, and so the property was not theirs to deal with.However in Ashburn Anstalt v Arnold [1989] Ch 1 a different Court of Appeal opined, in obiter dicta, that a third party transferee could not be bound (inconsistent with the reasoning of Lord Denning MR) unless it was express that a new property right was to be granted. Third, gifts or trusts that are made without completing all formalities will be enforced under a constructive trust if it is clear that the person making the gift or trust manifested a true intention to do so. In the leading case, Pennington v Waine[2002] 1 WLR 2075 a lady named Ada Crampton had wished to transfer 400 shares to her nephew, Harold, had filled in a share transfer form and given it to Mr Pennington, the company's auditors, and had died before Mr Pennington had registered it. Ada's other family members claimed the shares still belonged to them, but the Court of Appeal held that even though not formally complete, the estate held the shares on constructive trust for Harold. Similarly, in T Choithram International SA v Pagarani[2000] UKPC 46, [2001] 1 WLR 1 the Privy Council held that Mr Pagarani's estate held money on constructive trust after he died for a new foundation, even though Mr Pagarani had not completed the trust deeds, because he had publicly announced his intention to hold the money on trust. Fourth, if a person who is about to die secretly declares that he wishes property to go to someone not named in a will, the executor holds that property on constructive trust.e.g. Blackwell v Blackwell [1929] AC 318 and Ottaway v Norman [1972] Ch 698 Similarly, fifth, if a person writes a \\"mutual will\\" with their partner, agreeing that their property will go to a particular beneficiary when they both die, the surviving person cannot simply change their mind and will hold the property on constructive trust for the party who was agreed.e.g. Olins v Walters [2009] Ch 212 and Fry v Densham-Smith [2010] EWCA Civ 1410 It is more controversial whether \\"constructive trusts\\" in the family home respond to consent or intention, or really respond to contributions to property,See the judgment of Lord Denning MR in National Provincial Bank Ltd v Hastings Car Mart Ltd [1964] Ch 665 which are usually found in the \\"miscellaneous\\" category of events that generate obligations. In a sixth situation, constructive trusts have been acknowledged to arise since the late 1960s,See Gissing v Gissing where two people are living together in a family home, but are not married, and both are making financial or other contributions to the house, but only one is registered on the legal title. The law had settled in Lloyds Bank plc v Rosset[1991] AC 107 as requiring saying that (1) if an agreement had been made for both to share in the property, then a constructive trust would be imposed in favour of the person who was not registered, or (2) they had nevertheless made direct contributions to the purchase of the home or mortgage repayments, then they would have a share of the property under a constructive trust. However, in Stack v Dowden, and then Jones v Kernott the Law Lords held by a majority that Rosset probably no longer represented the law (if it ever did) and that a \\"common intention\\" to share in the property could be inferred from a wide array of circumstances (including potentially simply having children together), and also perhaps \\"imputed\\" without any evidence. However, if a constructive trust, and a property right binding third parties, arises in this situation based on imputed intentions, or simply on the basis that it was fair, it would mean that constructive trusts did not merely respond to consent, but also to the fact of valuable contributions being made. There remains significant debate both about the proper manner of characterising constructive trusts in this field, and also about how far the case law should match the statutory regime that applies for married couples under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973.This allows family courts to divide property according to all the relevant circumstance of the case, and typically reflects the contributions of the spouses to their former marriage. Constructive trusts arise in a number of situations that are generally classified as \\"wrongs\\", in the sense that they mirror a breach of duty by a trustee, by someone who owes fiduciary obligations, or anyone. In a seventh group of constructive trust cases (which also seems uncontroversial), a person who murders their wife or husband cannot inherit their property, and are said by the courts to hold any property on constructive trust for another next of kin.Re Crippen [1911] P 108, Crippen murdered his wife, but on her intestacy it did not pass to him, and then to Miss Le Neve via his will, but to his wife's blood relatives. Re K [1986] Ch 180 Eighth, it was held in Attorney General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd that information, or intellectual property, taken in breach of confidence would be held on constructive trust.[1990] 1 AC 109, 288, Lord Goff, 'the copyright in the book, including the film rights, are held by him on constructive trust for the confider'. Ninth, a trustee or another person in a fiduciary position, who breaches a duty and makes a profit out of it, has been held to hold all profits on constructive trust. For instance in Boardman v Phipps,[1967] 2 AC 46 a solicitor for a family trust and one of the trust's beneficiaries, took the opportunity to invest in a company in Australia, partly on the trust's behalf, but also making a profit themselves. They both stood in a \\"fiduciary\\" position of trust because as a solicitor, or someone managing the trust's affairs, the law requires they act solely in the trust's interest. Crucially, they failed to gain the fully informed consent of the beneficiaries to invest in the opportunity and make a profit themselves. This opened up a possibility that their interests could conflict with the interests of the trust. So, the House of Lords held they were in breach of duty, and that all profits they made were held on constructive trust, though they could claim quantum meruit (a salary fixed by the court) for the work they did. More straightforwardly, in Reading v Attorney-General the House of Lords held that an army sergeant (a fiduciary for the UK government) who took bribes while stationed in Egypt held his bribes on constructive trust for the Crown.[1951] AC 507 However, more recently it has become more controversial to classify these constructive trusts along with wrongs on the basis that the remedies that are available should differ from (and usually go further than) compensatory damages in tort. Also, it has been doubted that a constructive trust should be imposed that would bind third parties in an insolvency situation. In Sinclair Investments (UK) Ltd v Versailles Trade Finance Ltd, Lord Neuberger MR held that company's liquidators could not claim a proprietary interest in the fraudulent profits its former director had made if this would prejudice the director's other creditors in insolvency. The effect of a constructive trust would accordingly be limited so that it did not bind third party creditors of an insolvent defendant.[2011] EWCA Civ 347 The United Kingdom Supreme Court, however, has subsequently overruled Sinclair in FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC,[2014] UKSC 45 holding that a bribe or secret commission accepted by an agent is held on trust for his principal.. Unjust enrichment is seen to underlie a final group of constructive trust cases, although this remains controversial. In Chase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd[1981] Ch 105 Goulding J held that a bank that mistakenly paid money to another bank had a claim to the money back under a constructive trust. Mistake would typically be seen as an unjust enrichment claim today, and there is no debate over whether the money could be claimed back in principle. It was, however, questioned whether the claim for the money back should be proprietary in nature, and so whether a constructive trust should arise, particularly if this would bind third parties (for instance, if the recipient bank had gone insolvent). In Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC Lord Browne-Wilkinson held that a constructive trust could only arise if the recipient's conscience would have been affected at the time of the receipt or before any third party's rights had intervened. In this way, it is controversial whether unjust enrichment underlies any constructive trusts at all, although it remains unclear why someone's conscience being affected should make any difference.Mitchell (2010) 668 Content As the Charity Commission and The Pensions Regulator do for charities and pensions,See Pensions Act 2004 ss 1‚Äì106 and the Charities Act 2011 ss 2‚Äì21 the Financial Conduct Authority in Canary Wharf enforces statutory and fiduciary duties owed by investment businesses under the FSMA 2000. Most duties derive from trust law, but statute makes them compulsory and the regulator ensures compliance. Once a trust has been validly formed, the trust's terms guide its operation. While professionally drafted trust instruments often contain a full description of how trustees are appointed, how they should manage the property, and their rights and obligations, the law supplies a comprehensive set of default rules. Some were codified in the Trustee Act 2000 but others are construed by the courts. In many instances, English law follows a laissez- faire philosophy of \\"freedom of trust\\". In general, it will be left to the choice of the settlor to follow the law or to draft alternative rules. Where a trust instrument runs out or is silent, the law will fill the gaps. In contrast, in specific trusts, particularly pensions within the Pensions Act 1995, charities under the Charities Act 2011, and investment trusts regulated by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, many rules regarding trusts' administration, and the duties of trustees are made mandatory by statute. This reflects the view of Parliament that beneficiaries in those cases lack bargaining power and need protection, especially through enhanced disclosure rights. For family trusts, or private unmarketed trusts, the law can usually be contracted around, subject to an irreducible core of trust obligations. The scope of compulsory terms may be subject of debate, but Millett LJ in Armitage v Nurse[1998] Ch 241, 253 viewed that every trustee must always act \\"honestly and in good faith for the benefit of the beneficiaries\\". In addition to general principles of good administration, trustees' primary duties include fulfilling a duty of \\"undivided loyalty\\" by avoiding any possibility of a conflict of interest, exercising proper care, and following the terms of the trust to fulfil their purpose.cf AIB Group (UK) plc v Mark Redler & Co Solicitors [2014] UKSC 58, [51] per Lord Toulson Administration Possibly the most important aspect of good trust management is to have good trustees.JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) ch 17, 529 ff In virtually all cases, a settlor will have identified who trustees will be, but even if not or the chosen trustees refuse a court will, in the last resort appoint one under the Public Trustee Act 1906. A court may also replace trustees who are acting detrimentally to the trusts.Letterstedt v Broers (1884) LR 9 App Cas 371 Once a trust is running, Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 section 19 allow beneficiaries of full capacity to determine who the new trustees are, if other replacement procedures are not in the trust document. This is, however, simply an articulation of the general principle from Saunders v Vautier[1841] EWHC Ch J82, (1841) 4 Beav 115 that beneficiaries of full age and sound mind may by consensus dissolve the trust, or do with the property as they wish. According to the Trustee Act 2000 sections 11 and 15, a trustee may not delegate their power to distribute trust property without liability, but they may delegate administrative functions, and the power to manage assets if accompanied with a policy statement. If they do, they can be exempt from negligence claims. For the trust terms, these may be varied in any unforeseen emergency,TA 1925 s 57, Re New [1901] 1 Ch 534 but only in relation to the trustee's management powers, not a beneficiary's rights. The Variation of Trusts Act 1958 allows courts to vary trust terms, particularly on behalf of minors, people not yet entitled, or with remoter interests under a discretionary trust. For the latter group of people, who may have highly restricted rights, or know very little about a trust terms, the Privy Council affirmed in Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd[2003] UKPC 26 that courts have an inherent jurisdiction to administer trusts, and this goes especially to a requirement for information about a trust to be disclosed. Trustees, especially in family trusts, may often be expected to perform their services for free, although more commonly a trust will make provision for some payment. In absence of terms in the trust instrument, the Trustee Act 2000 sections 28‚Äì32 stipulate that professional trustees are entitled to a \\"reasonable remuneration\\", that all trustees may be reimbursed for expenses from the trust fund, and so may agents, nominees and custodians. The courts have said additionally, in Re Duke of Norfolk's Settlement Trusts[1982] Ch 61 there is a power to pay a trustee more for unforeseen but necessary work. Otherwise, all payments must be authorised explicitly to avoid the strict rule against any possibility of conflicts of interest. Duty of loyalty After managers of the South Sea Company and its stock brokers, depicted here, created the world's first stock market crash in 1719, Keech v Sandford decided all people handling others' money must avoid all possible conflicts of interest.[1726] EWHC Ch J76 The core duty of a trustee is to pursue the interests of the beneficiaries, or anyone else the trust permits, except the interests of the trustee himself.JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) 637 ff Put positively, this is described as the \\"fiduciary duty of loyalty\\". The term \\"fiduciary\\" simply means someone in a position of trust and confidence, and because a trustee is the core example of this, English law has for three centuries consistently reaffirmed that trustees, put negatively, may have no possibility of a conflict of interest. Shortly after the United Kingdom was formed, it had its first stock market crash in the South Sea Bubble, a crash where corrupt directors, trustees or politicians ruined the economy. Soon after, the Chancery Court decided Keech v Sandford. On a much smaller scale than the recent economic collapse, Keech claimed he was entitled to the profits his trustee, Sandford, had made by buying the lease on a market in Romford, now in East London. While Keech was still an infant, Sandford alleged he had been told by the market landlord that there would be no renewal for a child beneficiary. Only then, alleged Sandford, did he inquire and contract to purchase the lease in his own name. Lord King LC held this was irrelevant, because no matter how honest, the consequences of allowing a relaxed approach to trustee duties would be worse. The remedy for beneficiaries is restitution of all gains, and theoretically all profits are held on constructive trust for the trust fund.Boardman v Phipps [1967] 2 AC 46, 117, per Lord Guest The same rule of seeking approval applies for conflicted transactions known as \\"self- dealing\\", where a trustee contracts on the trust's behalf with himself or a related party. While strict at its core, a trustee may at any time simply seek approval of beneficiaries, or the court, before taking an opportunity that the trust could be interested in. The scope of the duty, and authorised transactions of specific types, may also be defined in the trust deed to exclude liability. This is so, according to Millett LJ in Armitage v Nurse up to the point that the trustee still acts \\"honestly and in good faith for the benefit of the beneficiaries\\". Lastly, if a trustee has in fact acted honestly, while a court may formally confirm the trustee must give up his profits, the court can award the trustee a generous quantum meruit. In Boardman v Phipps the solicitor, Mr Boardman, and a beneficiary, Tom Phipps, of the Phipps family trust saw an opportunity in one of the trust's investment companies and asked the managing trustee if the company could be bought out and restructured. The trustee said it was out of the question, but without seeking consent from the beneficiaries, Mr Boardman and Tom Phipps invested their own money. They made a profit for themselves, and the trust (which retained its investment) until another beneficiary, John, found out and sued to have the profits back. However, while almost every judge from Wilberforce J in the High Court, to the House of Lords (Lord Upjohn dissenting) agreed that no conflict of interest was allowable, they all approved generous quantum meruit to be deducted from any damages to reflect the effort of the defendants. While the duty of loyalty, as well as all other duties, will certainly apply to formally appointed trustees, people who assume the responsibility of trustees will also be bound by the same duties. In old French, such a person is called a \\"trustee de son tort\\". According to Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam[2003] 2 AC 366 to have fiduciary duties it is required that a person has assumed the function of a person in a position of trust and confidence. The assumption of such a position also opens such a fiduciary to claims for breaching a duty of care. Duty of care In 1742, Sir Robert Sutton and the other Charitable Corporation directors, who were meant to give microfinance to the poor, were found liable for the bankruptcy because of their corruption and negligence.The Charitable Corporation v Sutton (1742) 26 ER 642 Although poor decisions were not to be judged with hindsight, Lord Hardwicke applied a strict objective standard, now in the Trustee Act 2000 section 1. The duty of care owed by trustees and fiduciaries has its partner in the common law of negligence, and was also long recognised by courts of equity.JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) ch 18, 565 ff Millett LJ, however, in Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew[1998] 1 Ch 1 emphasised that although recognised in equity, and applicable to fiduciaries, the duty of care is not itself a fiduciary duty, like the rule against conflicts of interest. This means that like ordinary negligence actions, the common law requirements for proving causation of loss apply, and the remedy for breach of duty is of compensation for losses rather than restitution of gains. In Mothew this meant that a solicitor (who occupies a fiduciary position, like a trustee) who negligently told a building society that its client had no second mortgage was not liable for the loss in the property's value after the client defaulted. Mr Mothew successfully argued that Bristol & West would have granted the loan in any case, and so his advice did not cause their loss. The duty of care was codified in the Trustee Act 2000 section 1, as the \\"care and skill that is reasonable\\" to expect, regarding any special skills of the trustee. In practice this means that a trustee must be judged by what should be reasonably expected from another person in such a position of responsibility, being mindful not to judge decisions with the benefit of hindsight,See The Charitable Corporation v Sutton (1742) 26 ER 642 and mindful of the inherent risk involved in any property management venture.Harvard College v. Amory (1830) 26 Mass (9 Pick) 446, 461, Putnam J, 'Do what you will, the capital is at hazard.' As long ago as 1678, in Morley v Morley(1678) 22 ER 817 Lord Nottingham LC held that a trustee would not be liable if ¬£40 of the trust fund's gold was robbed, so long as he otherwise performed his duties.See also Speight v Gaunt (1883‚Äì84) LR 9 App Cas 1, where trustees who employed a dishonest broker that stole ¬£15,000 were not liable to repay the money to the beneficiaries because they acted in the ordinary course of business. Probably one of the main parts of the duty of care, in managing trust property, will relate to a trustee's investment choices. In Learoyd v Whiteley, Lindley LJ elaborated the general prudent person rule, that in investments one must 'take such care as an ordinary prudent man would take if he were minded to make an investment for the benefit of other people for whom he felt morally bound to provide'.(1886) 33 Ch D 347, and (1887) 12 AC 727, affirmed in the House of Lords. This meant a trustee who invested ¬£5000 in mortgages of a brick field and four houses with a shop, and lost the lot when the businesses went insolvent, was liable for the losses on the brick field, whose value must have known to be bound to depreciate as bricks were taken out. Bartlett v Barclays Bank Trust Co Ltd[1980] 1 Ch 515 suggests investments must be actively monitored, particularly by professional trustees. This duty was broken when the Barclays corporate trustee department, where trust assets held 99 per cent of a company's shares, failed to get any information or board representation before a disastrous property speculation.See also In re Lucking's Will Trusts [1968] 1 WLR 866, trustees with 70% shares in a company should have had representatives in management to stop director thieving company property. In making investments, TA 2000 section 4 requires that \\"standard investment criteria\\" must be observed, essentially along the lines of modern portfolio theory about diversification of investments to reduce risk.cf Nestl√© v National Westminster Bank plc [1993] 1 WLR 1260, trustees investing only in tax exempt gilts were not liable for failure to take care because although they should follow modern portfolio theory now, their actions were not to be judged with the benefit of hindsight. Section 5 suggests advice be sought on such matters if needed, but otherwise may invest anything that an ordinary property owner would. Additional restrictions, however, may be imposed depending on the how courts view the purpose of the trust, and the scope of a trustee's discretion. Purposes and discretion Beyond the essential duty of loyalty and duty of care, the primary task occupying trustees will be to follow the terms of a trust document.JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) ch 18, 565 Beyond the rules set out to be followed in the trust document, trustees will ordinarily have some measure of discretionary power, such as in making investment choices on the beneficiaries' behalf, or in managing and distributing trust funds.e.g. Trustee Act 1925 ss 31‚Äì32, on the power of maintenance and advancement The courts have sought to control the exercise of discretion so it is used only for purposes consistent with the object of the trust settlement. In general it is said that decisions will be overturned if they are irrational, or perverse to the settlor's expectations,Re Manisty's Settlement [1974] 1 Ch 17, Templeman J, courts will intervene on dispositive discretions (who gets what) if it 'could be said to be irrational, perverse or irrelevant to any sensible expectation of the settlor; for example, if they chose a beneficiary by height or complexion or by the irrelevant fact that he was a resident of Greater London.' but also in two further particular ways. UK trust law permits ethical investment policies, to divest from assets beneficiaries object to or promote particular causes.See Harries v Church Commissioners for England [1992] 1 WLR 1241 and R Goode, The Report of the Pension Law Review Committee (1993) Cmnd 2342, 349‚Äì350, trustees \\"are perfectly entitled to have a policy on ethical investment and to pursue that policy, so long as they treat the interests of the beneficiaries as paramount and the investment policy is consistent with the standards of care and prudence required by law.\\" A trust deed may expressly allow it, or otherwise trustees must simply not make financially detrimental decisions and sufficiently diversify investments under the Trustee Act 2000 section 4(3).See JE Martin, Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) 578‚Äì582 First, the courts have said that in choosing investments, trustees may not disregard the financial implications of the investment choice. In Cowan v Scargill[1985] Ch 270 the trustees of pensions represented by Arthur Scargill and the National Union of Mineworkers wished the pension fund to invest more in the troubled UK mining industry, by excluding investments, for instance, in competing industries, while the trustees appointed by the employer did not. Megarry J held the action would violate a trustee's duty if this action was taken. Drawing a parallel of refusing to invest in South African companies (during Apartheid) he warned that \\"the best interests of the beneficiaries are normally their best financial interests.\\" Although this was thought in some quarters to preclude ethical investment, it was made clear in Harries v Church Commissioners for England that the terms of a trust deed may explicitly authorise or prohibit certain investments, that if the object of a trust is, for example, Christian charity then a trustee could plainly invest in \\"Christian\\" things.[1992] 1 WLR 1241. In Harries, Donald Nicholls VC held that unless financial performance could be proven to be harmed, a trustee for church clergy retirement could take ethical considerations into account when investing money, and so avoid investments contrary to the religion's principles. By analogy, a trade union pension trustee could refuse to invest in apartheid South Africa, while the government there suppressed unions.See the apartheid law, the Industrial Conciliation Act 1956, which required unions to be racially segregated, and under which strikes were illegal until the new Labour Relations Act 1995. cf, decided before Harries, the Scottish case of Martin v City of Edinburgh DC [1988] SLT 239 The government commissioned report by Roy Goode on Pension Law Reform confirmed the view that trustees may have an ethical investment policy and use their discretion in following it.R Goode, The Report of the Pension Law Review Committee (1993) Cmnd 2342, 349‚Äì350 The modern approach in trust law is consistent with the UK company law duty of directors to pay regard to all stakeholders, not merely shareholders, in a company's management.Companies Act 2006 s 172 Trustees must simply invest according to general principles of the duty of care, and diversification.nb RA Brealey and SC Myers, Principles of Corporate Finance (3rd edn 1988) 156 state that investment in 20 companies realises 95% of the value of investing in a full stock market index listing, while investment in 100 companies realises 99% of the value of full index diversification. The second primary area where courts have sought to constrain trustee discretion, but recently have retreated, is in the rule that trustees' decisions may be interfered with if irrelevant issues are taken into account, or relevant issues are ignored. There had been suggestions that a decision could be wholly void, which led to a flood of claims where trustees had failed to get advice on taxation of trust transactions and were sometimes successful in having the transaction annulled and escaping payments to the Revenue.See Re Hastings-Bass [1975] Ch 25, Abacus Trust Co v NSPCC [2001] WTLR 953, Green v Cobham [2000] WTLR 1101, and Sieff v Fox [2005] 1 WLR 3811 However, in the leading case, Pitt v Holt[2013] UKSC 26 and [2011] EWCA Civ 197 the Supreme Court reaffirmed that poorly considered decisions may only become voidable (and so cannot be cancelled if a third party, like the Revenue, is affected) and only if mistakes are \\"fundamental\\" can a transaction be wholly void.By analogy see Bell v Lever Bros and The Great Peace in contract law In one appeal, a trustee for her husband's worker compensation got poor advice and was liable for more inheritance tax, and in the second, a trustee for his children got poor advice and was liable for more capital gains tax. The UK Supreme Court found that both transactions were valid. If a trustee had acted in breach of duty, but within its powers, then a transaction was voidable. However, on the facts, the trustees seeking advice had fulfilled their duty (and so the advisers could be liable for negligence instead). Breach and remedies Lincoln's Inn, off Chancery Lane, London, is the traditional home of Chancery barristers. When trustees fail in their main duties, the law imposes remedies according to the nature of the breach.JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) ch 23 In general, breaches of rules surrounding performance of the trust's terms can be remedied through an award of specific performance, or compensation. Breaches of the duty of care will trigger a right to compensation. Breaches of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and misapplications of property will give rise to a restitutionary claim, to restore the property taken away. In these last two situations, the courts of equity developed further principles of liability that could be applied even when a trustee had gone bankrupt. Some recipients of property that came from a breach of trust, as well as people who had assisted in a breach of trust, might incur liability. Equity recognised not merely a personal, but also a proprietary claim over assets taken in breach of trust, and perhaps also profits made in breach of the duty of loyalty. A proprietary claim meant that the claimant could demand the thing in priority to other creditors of the bankrupt trustee. Alternatively, the courts would follow an asset or trace its value if the trust property was exchanged for some other asset. If trust property had been given to a third party, the trust fund could claim back the property as of right, unless the recipient was a bona fide purchaser. Generally, any recipient of trust property who knew about the breach of trust (or maybe ought to have known) could be made to give back the value, even if they had themselves exchanged the thing for other assets. Lastly, against people who may never have received trust property but had assisted in a breach of trust, and had done so dishonestly, a claim arose to return the property's value. Remedies against trustees Chancery Court, depicted here in the early 18th century, recognised a wider variety of remedies than the common law courts. If a trustee has broken a duty owed to the trust, there are three main remedies.JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) chs 23 691‚Äì702 (compensation and restitution) and 24‚Äì25 (specific performance and injunctions) First, specific performance may generally be awarded in cases where the beneficiary merely wishes to compel a trustee to follow the trust's terms, or to prevent an anticipated breach.e.g. Fox v Fox (1870) LR 11 Eq 142, an injunction to prevent the trustee distributing trust property improperly. Second, for losses, beneficiaries may claim compensation. The applicable principles are disputed, given the historical language of requiring a trustee to \\"account\\" for things which go wrong. One view suggested that at the very moment a trustee breaches a duty, for instance by making an erroneous investment without considering relevant matters, beneficiaries have a right to see the trust accounts are surcharged, to erase the transpiring loss (and \\"falsified\\" to restore to the trust fund unauthorised gains).See PJ Millett, 'Equity's Place in the Law of Commerce' (1998) 114 LQR 214 In Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns[1995] UKHL 10, [1996] AC 421 the argument was taken to a new level, where a solicitor (a fiduciary, like a trustee) was given ¬£1.5m by Target Holdings Ltd to hold for a loan for some property developers, but released the money before it was meant to (when purchase of the development property was completed). The money did reach the developers, but the venture was a flop, and money lost. Target Holdings Ltd attempted to sue Redferns for the whole sum, but the House of Lords held that the loss was caused by the venture flop, not the solicitor's action outside instructions. It was, however, observed that the common law rules of remoteness would not apply.Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns [1995] UKHL 10, [1996] AC 421, 434‚Äì5 Similarly in Swindle v Harrison[1997] 4 All ER 705 a solicitor, Mr Swindle, could not be sued for the loss of Ms Harrison's second home's value after he gave her negligent and dishonest advice about loans, because she would have taken the loan and made the purchase anyway, and the house value drop was unrelated to his breach of duty. The third kind of remedy, for unauthorised gains, is restitution. In Murad v Al Saraj[2005] EWCA Civ 959, [2005] All ER (D) 503 the Murad sisters entered a joint venture (creating a fiduciary relation, like for trustees) with Mr Al Saraj to buy a hotel. He deceitfully told them he was investing all his own money, when in fact he set off a debt from the seller and took an undisclosed commission. When sued to give up the profits he made, he submitted that the sisters would have entered the transaction even if they had known what he had done. Arden LJ rejected this argument, affirming that upon such a wrong, it was not open for the fiduciary to argue what might, hypothetically, have happened. A reduction in liability could only come from a determination of the value of skill and effort contributed. This is less generously quantified for dishonest fiduciaries, but generous allowances are typically given, as in Boardman v Phipps for fiduciaries who all along act honestly.[1965] Ch 992, 1021. See also the Australian case Warman International Ltd v Dwyer [1995] HCA 18 and Docker v Somes (1834) 2 My&K; 655, drawing the line between profits deriving from breach of fiduciary duty and those from one's own labour and effort Trustees who are found to commit wrongs may also have a defence under the Trustee Act 1925 sections 61‚Äì62. This gives courts discretion to relieve liability for people who acted \\"honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused\\". There may also be exclusion clauses in the trust deed, up to the point of removing liability for fraud and open conflicts of interest.Armitage v Nurse [1998] Ch 241 Chiefly exclusion clauses will erase liability for breaches of the duty of care, although for professional trustees the ability to do this is constrained by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. If agreements for money management take place through contracts, a professional trustee probably cannot exclude liability for breach of contract under section 3, because given that he would be better placed to take out insurance liability exclusion will probably not be reasonable under section 11. Lastly, the Limitation Act 1980 sections 21‚Äì22 prevents claims for innocent or negligent trust breach being pursued six years after the right of action accrues, again with the exception for fraud or property converted by trustees for their own use, where there is no limit. Tracing Partly because it may not always be the case that a wrongdoing trustee can be found, or remains solvent, tracing became an important step in restitutionary claims for breach of trust.JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) 719‚Äì755 Tracing means tracking the value of an asset that properly belongs to a trust fund, such as a car, shares, money, or profits made by a trustee through a conflict of interest. If those things are exchanged for other things (i.e. money or assets) then the value residing in the new thing can potentially be claimed by the beneficiaries. For example, in an early case, Taylor v Plumer(1815) 3 M&S; 562 a dishonest broker, Mr Walsh, was given ¬£22,200 in a banker's draft and was meant to invest in Exchequer Bills (UK government bonds) for a Sir Thomas Plumer. Instead he bought gold doubloons and was planning a get-away to the Caribbean until he was apprehended at Falmouth. Lord Ellenborough held that the property belonged to Sir Thomas, in whatever form it had become. It may also be that the value of the traced trust money has changed, and possibly risen considerably. In the leading case, Foskett v McKeown[2001] 1 AC 102 an investment manager wrongfully took ¬£20,440 from his clients, paid the last two out of five installments on a life insurance policy, and committed suicide. The insurance company paid out ¬£1,000,000, although under the policy's terms this would have been paid out anyway. The majority of the House of Lords held that clients could trace their money into the payout and claim a proportionate share (¬£400,000).The minority, Lord Hope and Lord Steyn would have held that only ¬£20,440 plus interest could be claimed. Theoretically the case was controversial, as the House of Lords rejected that such a tracing claim was founded upon unjust enrichment, as opposed to being the vindication of a property right.See A Burrows, 'Proprietary restitution: unmasking unjust enrichment‚Äô (2001) 117 LQR 412, contending that an unjust enrichment analysis was preferable because the idea of property persisting through changes of hands was fictitious, and their Lordships were mistaken to think that an unjust enrichment claim required a causal link between the claimant's loss and the defendant's gain. Robert Maxwell stole the pension funds of his employees at the Daily Mirror and accidentally fell off his yacht, the Lady Mona K, near the Canary Islands. Bishopsgate Investment Mgt Ltd v Homan held Maxwell and his inheritors were strictly liable to account for misapplication of the assets.[1994] EWCA Civ 33, [1995] Ch 211 When trust assets are mixed up with property of the trustee, or other people, the general approach of the courts is to resolve the issues in favour of the wronged beneficiary. For example, in Re Hallett's Estate,Re Hallett's Estate (1880) 13 Ch D 696 a solicitor sold ¬£2145 worth of bonds he was meant to hold for his client and put the money in his account. Although money had subsequently been drawn and redeposited in the account, the balance of ¬£3000 was enough to return all the money to his clients. According to Lord Jessel MR, a fiduciary \\"cannot be heard to say that he took away the trust money when he had a right to take away his own money\\". Again, in Re Oatway,[1903] Ch 356 a trustee who took money and made a deposit with his bank account, and then bought shares which rose in value, was held by Joyce J to have used the beneficiary's money on the shares. This was the most beneficial result possible. When trust assets are mixed up with money from other beneficiaries, the courts have had more difficulty. Originally, by the rule in Clayton's case, it was said that the money taken out of a bank account would be presumed to come from the first person's money that was put in. So in that case it meant that when a banking partnership, before it went insolvent, made payments to one of its depositors, Mr Clayton, the payments made discharged the debt of the first partner that died. However, this \\"first in, first out\\" rule is essentially disapplied in all but the simplest cases. In Barlow Clowes International Ltd v Vaughan[1992] 4 All ER 22 Woolf LJ held that it would not apply if it might be 'impracticable or result in injustice', or if it ran contrary to the parties intentions. There, Vaughan was one of a multitude of investors in Barlow Clowes' managed fund portfolios. Their investments had been numerous, of different sizes and over long periods of time, and each investor knew that they had bought into a collective investment scheme. Accordingly, when Barlow Clowes went insolvent, each investor was held to simply share the loss proportionately, or pari passu. A third alternative, said by Leggatt LJ to generally be fairer (though complex to compute) is to share losses through a \\"rolling pari passu\\" system. Given the complexity of the accounts, and the trading of each investor, this approach was not used in Vaughan, but it would have seen a proportionate reduction of all account holders' interest at each step of an account's depletion.Suppose that (1) A invests ¬£100 in a fund (2) B invests ¬£100 in the same fund (3) ¬£100 is depleted (4) C invests ¬£100 (5) ¬£100 is depleted. A pari passu system would say that the total losses (¬£200) should be shared proportionally, so that A, B and C, all are left with ¬£33.33. Clayton's case first in, first out rule would say A loses ¬£100, and B loses ¬£100, while C loses nothing. Rolling pari passu would say that A and B lose ¬£50 at point (3), leaving ¬£50 each. Then C's ¬£100 is added to the fund, with A and B having ¬£50 each (¬£200 in total). The ¬£100 loss at point (5) is shared proportionally, so A and B are left with ¬£25, and C is left with ¬£50. A significant topic of debate, however, is whether the courts should allow tracing into an asset which has been bought on credit. The weight of authority suggests this is possible, either through subrogation,See Boscawen v Bajwa [1995] EWCA Civ 15, [1996] 1 WLR 328 or on the justification that the assets of a recipient who pays off a debt on a thing are \\"swollen\\".See Space Investments Ltd v Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Trust Co (Bahamas) Ltd [1986] UKPC 1, [1986] 1 WLR 1072 In Bishopsgate Investment Management Ltd v Homan,[1995] Ch 211 however, the Court of Appeal held that pensioners of the crooked newspaper owner, Robert Maxwell, who had their money stolen, could not have a charge over the money in whose overdrawn accounts their money was deposited. It was said that when money was put into an overdrawn account, it was simply exhausted, and even if the money had been later used for the company's purposes, the law must end the tracing exercise. This result was doubted by the Privy Council in Brazil v Durant International Corporation, as Lord Toulson advised that backwards tracing is possible if there is \\"a coordination between the depletion of the trust fund and the acquisition of the asset which is the subject of the tracing claim, looking at the whole transaction, such as to warrant the court attributing the value of the interest acquired to the misuse of the trust fund.\\"[2015] UKPC 35, [40] Liability for receipt Although beneficiaries of a trust, or those owed fiduciary duties, will ordinarily wish to sue trustees first for breach of obligations, the trustee may have disappeared, or become insolvent, or perhaps the beneficiaries will desire to have a specific asset returned. In all these situations, the law allows a limited remedy if a person that received trust property is not \\"equity's darling\\": the \\"bona fide purchaser\\" of the asset.JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) ch 12, 341‚Äì349 A bona fide purchaser of property, even if property is received after a breach of trust, has long been held to take free of any claims by prior owners, if they acted in good faith, committed no wrong, and they have paid for the property. When the value in assets is traced, this process is technically said to be \\"genuinely neutral as to the rights\\" a claimant may have.P Birks, 'The Necessity of a Unitary Law of Tracing' in Making Commercial Law, Essays in Honour of Roy Goode (1997) 239, 257, tracing is \\"cleanly separated from the business of asserting rights in or in relation to assets successfully traced\\", approved in Foskett v McKeown [2000] UKHL 29 Only if recipients have committed additional wrongs, through some form of negligence, knowledge or dishonesty, will they liable, with a good claim at the end of the tracing process. However, the law is unsettled on what is needed, and divides between a traditional common law or equity approach, on the one hand, and a more modern unjust enrichment and tort law analysis on the other hand. In all cases, however, the recipient must have received property for their \\"own use and benefit\\". This means that in cases where solicitors,See Barnes v Addy (1873‚Äì74) LR 9 Ch App 244 and potentially banks,Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson [1990] Ch 265, 292, per Millett J, or other parties that merely act as conduits, that receive money simply to pass it onto someone else, they have not been regarded as a liable recipient. The Bank of England closed the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the world's 7th largest in 1991, after learning it had engaged in fraud and allowed terrorist groups to open accounts.e.g. the Abu Nidal Organization. See Lord Bingham, Inquiry into the Supervision of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (1992) Appendix 8, and Three Rivers District Council v Governor and Company of the Bank of England [2004] UKHL 48, holding the Bank of England was not liable for misfeasance in failing to oversee BCCI. Traditionally, common law used to allow a claim from anybody who had money, but had lost it or had been deprived of it, from a person who had received the money without payment, as of right.See Holiday v Sigil (1826) 2 C&P; 176 This action for \\"money had and received\\" was, however, limited to money, and was said to be limited to money in physical form.See Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson [1990] Ch 265 In equity, an action could be brought for return of any property that could be traced, but the courts said liability was limited to people who in some sense had \\"knowledge\\" of a breach of trust. In 2001, the Court of Appeal in Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd v Akindele[2001] Ch 437 stated that the touchstone of liability is that a defendant acted \\"unconscionably\\". In that case, Akindele, a Nigerian businessman, was sued by the liquidators of the disgraced and insolvent bank, BCCI to return over $6.6m. Akindele said he received this payment, so far as he knew, as part of a legitimate fixed return deal, when in fact BCCI was engaging in a fraudulent scheme to buy its own shares, and thus inflate its share price. Nourse LJ held that on these facts, Akindele had done nothing \\"unconscionable\\" and was not liable to return the money. In other cases, however, it is apparent that the standard has been less lenient, and set at negligence. In 1980 in Belmont Finance Corp v Williams Furniture Ltd[1980] 1 All ER 393 Goff LJ held that if one \\"ought to know, that it was a breach of trust\\" when property is received then liability will follow. Accordingly, different courts have differed on the requisite threshold of liability. Some have thought liability for receipt should be limited to \\"wilfully and recklessly failing to make such inquiries as an honest and reasonable man would make\\",See Sir Robert Megarry VC, Re Montagu's ST [1987] Ch 264, 278 while others have favoured a simple negligence standard, when a breach of trust would have been obvious to an honest, reasonable person. The latter view is consistent with an unjust enrichment analysis, favoured by the late Peter Birks and Lord Nicholls in extrajudicial writing.P Birks, 'Receipt' in Birks and Pretto (eds), Breach of Trust (Hart 2002) ch 7 and Lord Nicholls, 'Knowing receipt: the need for a new landmark‚Äô in Cornish, Nolan, O‚ÄôSullivan and Virgo (eds) Restitution: Past, Present and Future (Hart 1998) ch 15 This favours strict liability upon receipt of any property, unless it is paid for. If the recipient is not a bona fide purchaser, they must make restitution of the property to the former owner to avoid unjust enrichment. This was an approach adopted by the House of Lords in Re Diplock.Re Diplock [1951] AC 251, [1948] Ch 465. Here the testators mistakenly paid money from a will to charities, and the charities had to return the money. However, unlike Re Diplock the modern unjust enrichment analysis would allow a defence, if the recipient had changed her position, for instance by spending money that would not otherwise have been spent, a defence recognised in Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale.[1988] UKHL 12 This approach ends by suggesting that even if the property is paid for, yet the recipient ought to have known that it came from a breach of trust, they will be deemed to have committed an equitable wrong (i.e. like a tort) and must restore the property to the previous owner anyway. It remains to be seen whether equity's understanding of conscience will align with the standard test for the duty of care in tort. Dishonest assistance Liability for breach of trust extends not only to the fiduciary who breaches his or her duty, and potentially to recipients of trust property, but may also reach people who have assisted the breach of fiduciary duty.JE Martin, Hanbury & Martin: Modern Equity (19th edn Sweet & Maxwell 2012) ch 12, 334‚Äì341 Generally speaking there must be both an act of assistance, and then a dishonest state of mind. The first requirement is that an act was done by a defendant which somehow lent assistance to the wrongdoers. In Brinks Ltd v Abu-Saleh[1996] CLC 133 Mrs Abu-Saleh drove her husband to Switzerland. She thought this was part of some tax evasion scheme, but did not ask (or was not told, it was accepted). In fact Mr Abu-Saleh was laundering gold bullion, the proceeds of a theft. Rimer J held that she had not \\"assisted\\", because by driving she was apparently only making her husband's experience more pleasant. This was not an act of assistance. The founder of the investment company Barlow Clowes dishonestly channeled investors' money into perks for himself and his wife including a Bordeaux chateau and vineyard, before they were uncovered and prosecuted. The Privy Council advised that Isle of Mann money agents who assisted in a way honest people would think is dishonest were liable for investors' losses.See P Popham, 'The looking-glass world of Mr and Mrs Clowes' (1 March 1996) The Independent The courts had been divided over what, in addition to an act of \\"assistance\\" was an appropriate mental element of fault, if any. In Abu-Saleh it was thought that it was also not enough for Ms Abu-Saleh have been dishonest about the wrong thing (tax evasion, rather than breach of trust), but this view was held to be wrong by Lord Hoffmann in the leading case, Barlow Clowes International Ltd v Eurotrust International Ltd.[2005] UKPC 37 Before this, in Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan,[1995] 2 AC 378 the House of Lords had resolved that \\"dishonesty\\" was a necessary element. It was also irrelevant whether the trustee was dishonest if the assistant that was actually being sued was dishonest. This meant that when Mr Tan, the managing director of a travel booking company, took booking money that his company was supposed to hold on trust for Royal Brunei Airlines, and used it for his own business, Mr Tan was liable to repay all sums personally. It did not matter whether the trustee (the company) was dishonest or not. By contrast, in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley it was seemed to be held that a solicitor, Mr Leech, who paid money to Mr Yardley to buy property, was not dishonest because he genuinely thought he could do this. In Barlow Clowes International Ltd v Eurotrust International Ltd[2005] UKPC 37, [2006] 1 All ER 333 the Privy Council clarified that the test for \\"dishonesty\\", however, is not subjective like the criminal law test from R v Ghosh. It is objective. If a reasonable person would think an action is dishonest, the action is dishonest, and the defendant need not appreciate that they have acted dishonestly by the standards of the community. This led the Privy Council to agree that a director of an Isle of Mann company was dishonest, because, even though he did not know for sure, he was found at trial to have suspected that money passing through his hands was from a securities fraud scheme by Barlow Clowes. The result is that, because liability is based on objective fault, more defendants will be caught. If a claimant does bring an action for dishonest assistance, or liability for receipt, Tang Man Sit v Capacious Investments Ltd[1996] AC 514 affirmed the principle that the claimant may not be overcompensated by suing for the same thing twice. So, Capacious Investments Ltd could make a claim against the late Mr Tang Man Sit's personal representative for renting out its properties, and it could ask the court to assess the amounts of both (1) loss of profits, and (2) loss of use and occupation, but then it could only claim one. Theory Within academic theories of trust law, there have been at least three main strands of discussion that have preoccupied authors in recent years. First, because trust law derived from the Lord Chancellor and courts of equity, separate from the common law (at least notionally) there has been a persistent debate over the extent that common law and equity should be \\"fused\\". Before the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 and 1875, influential judges and authors, such as Edward Coke,See Earl of Oxford's case (1615) 21 ER 485 and William Blackstone, had disapproved the notion that equitable jurisdiction was in some way distinct from the law. In the 19th century, Charles Dickens' books had heaped enough ridicule on the Victorian Chancery judges to impel reform. The court systems were merged, and if there was a conflict the precedents deriving from equity would prevail. But there remained disagreement about whether this was meant to achieve fusion in \\"substance\\", rather than merely a fusion of \\"procedure\\".See generally, Harris v Digital Pulse Pty Ltd (2003) 197 ALR 626. The minority view, particularly well represented in Australia, is that equity represents a distinctive set of principles and its own logic, as manifested in the institutions it created, such as the trust.See R Meagher, W Gummow and J Lehane, Equity: Doctrines and Remedies (3rd ed.) 45. JD Heydon, W Gummow and R Austin, Cases and Materials on Equity and Trusts (4th ed) 13. See also J Martin, 'Fusion, fallacy and confusion; a comparative study' [1994] Conveyancer and Property Lawyer 13 The majority view, however, is that there is no good reason why, as Andrew Burrows has written \\"We do this at common law but that in equity\\" when the situations are functionally identical, to treat like cases alike.A Burrows, 'We do this at common law but that in equity' (2002) 22 OJLS 1 If rules in equity, including trust law, did one thing and common law did another, either the common law was wrong or equity was wrong. One of the rules should be changed. Since the House of Lords and the Supreme Court declared it would overrule previous judgments that did not meet the evolving requirements of contemporary justice,Practice Statement [1966] 3 All ER 77 the notional primacy of equity over common law was effectively obsolete. Even if a precedent in equity did still prevail over common law, either or both could be overruled in the interests of justice. In practice, the debate about the fusion of law and equity has waned in importance compared to discussion of how to fuse interpretation of judge made law with statutory regulation (for instance in the context of pensions or investment),See Sir Rupert Cross, Statutory Interpretation (1975), A Burrows, 'The relationship between common law and statute in the law of obligations' (2012) 128 LQR 232. In the case law see Johnson v Unisys Ltd [2001] UKHL 13 and Gisda Cyf v Barratt [2010] UKSC 41 and how to fuse national law with international norms, in an emergent system of global justice. Second, among those who believe in \\"substantive\\" fusion, there has been intensive discussion about the appropriate taxonomy that underlies the law of trusts. A first aspect of this is that, for some, trusts appear to straddle the supposed boundary between \\"property\\" and \\"obligations\\". When English law was being codified and exported through the British Empire, for example in the Indian Trusts Act 1882, the authors thought it was thought appropriate to describe a trust as \\"an obligation annexed to the ownership of property\\", implying a view often restated, that \\"equity acts in personam\\". On the other hand, it has been consistently held that the beneficiary of a trust holds a proprietary right. This enables the beneficiary to claim priority over some (but not all) non-proprietary creditors in insolvency, or the beneficiary to bring a direct action in tort against a defendant who has damaged trust property. It is also acknowledged that the beneficiary may trace money that has wrongly been dissipated from the trust, but unlike a legal property owner, perhaps not against a bona fide purchaser. Peter Birks, on this ground, has suggested that beneficial interests trusts are a slightly weaker form of proprietary right. Ben McFarlane and Robert Stevens have alternatively suggested that beneficial interests are neither personal nor proprietary, but instead a \\"right against a right\\". One of the difficulties underpinning the debate is that it assumes the distinction between obligations (which operate only between persons) and property (which either operate against a thing, or bind third parties) is a coherent one: \\"proprietary\\" rights do not ultimately operate against \\"things\\" rather than people,On this point, see for example K Gray and S Gray, Land Law (2009) ch 1 while supposedly \\"personal\\" obligations bind third parties who would interfere with them as much as proprietary rights are thought to.Lumley v Gye [1853] EWHC QB J73 It would follow that a \\"right against a right\\" is conceptually incomplete, because a right is an abstract thing that cannot bear a duty: a person does.See WN Hohfeld, 'Some fundamental legal conceptions as applied in judicial reasoning' (1913) 23 Yale Law Journal 16, 42 ff On this view the function of trusts is to form part of a system of priorities among all rights (regardless of their historical status as personal or property right) when faced of conflicts over assets, particularly against other creditors of an insolvent debtor. A second aspect of the debate among those who favour substantive fusion is (beyond whether rights in trusts are personal or proprietary) which underlying \\"event\\" to which different trusts \\"respond\\". Adding to the scheme of Gaius,Gaius, Institutes that saw obligations as coming from contracts and wrongs, unjust enrichment lawyers emphasised that their field was a neglected tertium quid. According to the most influential scheme advocated by Peter Birks, obligations divide into consents, wrongs, unjust enrichments, and \\"miscellaneous\\" other events. On this view, express trusts (like contracts, gifts, or estoppels) were consent based, some constructive trusts were too, while other constructive trusts produced rights (proprietary, or with priority in insolvency) for wrongs, and other constructive trusts and all resulting trusts were founded in unjust enrichment. *A third area of academic debate concerns the role of equitable principles or fiduciary duties in protecting the weaker party in establishing a new bill of economic and social rights: consent, autonomy and Vernon v Bethell.

History As per the legend, once a lady working on the field, being tired and disappointed, sat on a rock where the Temple stands today and started to sharpen her sickle on the rock. While sharpening the sickle, drops of blood began to ooze from the rock. Frightened, the she called for the help and started running with fear. When people gathered, they saw an idol of god standing on the rock. It was an idol of three faces representing Lord Vishnu, Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva. Later a temple was built on this rock. This is the only temple of its kind having three gods in the same Sree Kovil. Jaya bhali and Shiva rathri are the important festivals being celebrated here. Temples Thrikkattiri temple originally belonged to Trikatiri Nair veed at Trikatiri. As the story further goes, once a very old brahmin came to visit Trikateri Nair Veed Mooppil Nair (the senior most person in the family). After the lunch they were engaged in discussing various places travelled by the bramhin during his pilgrimage. As the discussion progressed, the brahmin expressed an interest in buying the Moonummorthy temple. The Mooppil Nair laughed at his proposition and challenged him. He told the brahmin that if he can give 1000 gold coins immediately it can be given. The brahmin took his walking stick, opened the lid at one end, and emptied the gold coins kept hidden inside. The Mooppil Nair has to stand by his word and he has to hand over the temple to the brahmin. That is how the ownership of Moonnumoorthy temple was transferred to Moothrigkot Mana, one of the oldest and wealthy bramhin family of Kerala. Legends Another story is that, one hungry Brahmin came to the temple hoping to have prasadm and lunch. Just before having his food, he asked to whom the temple belonged, When he heard that the owners were the Family of Nair Veedu, the Brahmin got up without eating, telling that he, being a Brahman, cannot eat from a temple owned by any Nair family. When the moopil air (the senior most member of the family ) heard it, he immediately rushed to meet the Brahmin to persuade him not to leave without food. To ensure that he met the condition of the Brahmin, the tharavad karanavar on the spot gifted the temple to the nearest Brahmin family, the moothringode mana, the temple by taking an oath in front of the temple lamp. The brahmin was pleased and left after eating his lunch. That's how the ownership was changed to the moothringode mana. Puthur Madam The lofty roof of the large house, seen at the righthand corner in the above picture of the temple, is Puthur Madham. \\"Ms Kunhanujathi Nethiar avarkal\\" is the senior most noble lady of that house of many illustrious members. Nairs in Kerala follow the matrilineal system where the senior most lady wields equal authority in all family matters and holds most of family lands. Kunjanujathi Nethiar Avarkal remained a prominent devotee of the temple throughout her life. Transportation This town connects to other parts of India through Palakkad city.

Maguire made his first appearance for the team during the 2004 National League and has been Dublin's first-choice goalkeeper since then. Since then he has won one National Hurling League medal and one All-Star award. Maguire has been a runner-up in two Leinster finals. At club level Maguire plays with Ballyboden St Enda's and has won five consecutive county club championship medals. Playing career=Club Maguire began his senior club career as a dual player with Ballyboden St Enda's; however, he gave up on Gaelic football to concentrate on his hurling career. After facing some heart-breaking one-point defeats in a number of championship deciders, Ballyboden St Enda's reached the county final once again in 2007. A 2-13 to 1-5 trouncing of St Vincent's gave Ballyboden their first ever championship. It was a first championship medal for Maguire. Ballyboden St Enda's went on to dominate club hurling in Dublin for the rest of the decade. Subsequent county final defeats of Kilmacud Crokes, Craobh Chiar√°in, St Vincent's again and O'Toole's gave Ballyboden a record-equaling five championship titles in-a-row. Maguire played a key role in goal in all of these victories, including being named Dublin Hurler of the Year in 2010. Inter-county Maguire first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as goalkeeper on the Dublin minor hurling team in 2000. He spent two seasons with the minors and enjoyed little success, having ended up on the losing side to Offaly in the 2000 Leinster final. After later joining the Dublin under-21 team, Maguire featured when the team lost back-to-back provincial deciders in 2002 and 2003. Maguire was still a member of the Dublin under-21 team when he made his senior debut in a National Hurling League game against Kilkenny. He made his championship debut later that same year in a Leinster quarter-final against Westmeath. His first few championship seasons saw Dublin face some narrow losses in the provincial series of games, however, in 2009 Maguire's side qualified for a first Leinster final in eighteen years. A 2-18 to 0-18 score line gave victory to Kilkenny. After a disappointing championship in 2010, 'the Dubs' qualified for the National League final in 2011, their first decider in over seventy years. An epic 0-22 to 1-7 defeat of Kilkenny gave Maguire a National League winners' medal. Both sides met again in the Leinster final that day, however, the result was reversed on this occasion. A 4-17 to 1-15 score line gave victory to 'the Cats'. In spite of this defeat Dublin remained in the championship and reached an All-Ireland semi-final against reigning All-Ireland champions Tipperary. Maguire's side gave Tipp an almighty scare, however, the champions narrowly won by 1-19 to 0-18. Maguire finished off the season by winning his very first All-Star award. Maguire retired from the inter-county scene after the 2018 season along with club mate Shane Durkin, Maguire bowed out having represented Dublin for 15 seasons. Inter- provincial Maguire has also been picked for the Leinster inter-provincial hurling team for the Railway Cup competition.

It was widely procured by the U.S. military from 1952 until 1957, after which U.S. purchases were reduced to the U.S. Marine Corps. The Marine version had minor differences from the units used by other branches. The MD was the first Willys jeep with a significantly restyled body, immediately recognizable by its rounded hood and fenders. It formed the basis for the civilian and commercial Jeep CJ5, built for three decades (1954‚Äì1983), and subsequent models, and called the first 'round-fendered' Jeep. Although hard doors were still not available, the soft-top could be complemented with soft side panels and little hinged doors, that consisted of a thin steel frame with cloth and plastic window.M38A1 with hinged soft-top door For the U.S. Army, the MD was replaced by the Ford M151 jeep, from 1960. Low volume production of M38A1s for export to friendly foreign governments continued through 1971. Production totalled 101,488 units (80,290 domestic / 21,198 foreign sales). M38A1 jeeps saw extensive service during the Korean War, Vietnam War and several other conflicts. Description The M38A1 was frequently mated with the M100 (Korean War) version of the Jeep trailer. The M38A1 / MD was the second post-war evolution of the World War II Willys MB jeep (after the M38 or MC; F engine Prototypes), and the first Willys Jeep to feature the new rounded fenders and hood body design that would become the distinguishing body style of the 1955 CJ5, and which was carried through for decades on the CJ6, CJ7 and CJ8 Jeeps.

The spare tire was relocated in a special wheel well on the right interior side of the vehicle, and a larger fuel tank was fitted. Capacity was six seated passengers, or three lying on litters. A total of 4,155 M170 ambulances were designed and built by Kaiser Jeep of Toledo, Ohio, from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s.M170 - Ambulance Variant ‚Äî M38A1.com U.S. Marines Variant There is no official, nor uniform specification, for the M38A1s that where manufactured specifically for the United States Marine Corps. USMC jeeps had to be air transportable, hung under a helicopter, so they all had a reinforced rear bumper, for lift ring fitment, and most indeed had front and rear lift rings.USMC Variant - Differences between years and variants  M38A1.com The rear lift rings were fitted (by or for USMC) in a different position, than standard jeeps had been prepared for from the factory. Further, most USMC jeeps had more waterproofing, and roughly two thirds of them received more undercoating ‚Äì to the frame exterior, under the floor and hood, and the bottom half of the firewall. For better traction, the Marine Corps started ordering limited-slip differentials, especially on the rear axle, and mostly after introduction of the M151 jeeps in the Army. USMC jeeps were painted 34052 forest green, with flat yellow numbering on the hood only. Little or no other markings were applied on USMC jeeps.

According to Canadian author David Dunlop, over 1,000 M38A1s were built by Ford of Canada in 1952/1953.Kaiser Jeep in Canada 1959-69 ‚Äì CJ3B.info Next, Kaiser Jeep of Canada Ltd started assembling Jeeps in Windsor in 1954 or in 1959, in the former Willys factory, established there in 1934. Initially building only CJ-5 jeeps, at a targeted rate of 1,000 a year, in 1967 a Canadian government contract came, to build 800 M38A1 Jeeps for the Canadian Forces at $2,789,000 CDN. Unclear about 1959-69 Windsor production is how many other Jeep models and units were built for the Canadian military. Anecdotal evidence has surfaced of a domestic Canadian Navy unit, built in 1964. =Dutch: NEKAF jeeps= The Dutch Army also used the short wheelbase M38A1 as an ambulance ‚Äì instead of the long wheelbase M170. After initially using surplus U.S. war jeeps after World War II, a successor model was required by the Royal Netherlands Army, from the early 1950s. Wanting to support Dutch industry, a prototype four-wheel drive design by the country's only volume car and truck manufacturer DAF, the H-driven DAF YA-054, was considered, competing with U.S.-built M38A1s, a number of which had been supplied under the Mutual Defense Assistance program.NEKAF Production Units - Differences between years and variants  M38A1.com The DAF proposal seemed neither better nor cheaper and lost the race, but as an economic stimulus, the American Jeeps were to be assembled in HollandColloquial usage of the term! from knock-down kits parts, made in the U.S.A., in the \\"NEtherlands KAiser-Frazer\\" (or 'NEKAF') factory. Eventually some 24 % of the NEKAF jeep's parts were supplied by Dutch firms. Nekaf jeeps were identical to U.S. M38A1s, except for minor lighting additions. Dutch Army M38A1 MD jeep Production spanned from 1955 to 1958, under Kaiser-Frazer (some 5,650 units), after which time production was taken over by a Dutch company, who delivered another 2,237 jeeps through 1963, still using the 'NEKAF' name, for a total of just under 8,000 units. The M38A1 Jeep eventually served with one of the longest service records in the Royal Dutch military, for more than 40 years, from 1952 until 1996, as a result of both budget constraints, and sheer longevity of the vehicles, even outlasting the DKW Mungas, which had been bought to replace them in Dutch service, as well as some 1,200 DAF YA 66s supplied in the 1970s, which had little to no off-road capability, and which were decommissioned in the early 1990s. After 1959, with American part sets, 355 Nekafs were converted to M38A1C: 106mm M40 recoilless rifle carriers, and from 1983 to 1989, forty M38A1Cs were equipped with cable- guided TOW missiles. =Iranian= Jeep Truck copies (variously called the Simurg or Simoorgh) produced by the firm of Sherkat-Sahami in Iran.Neville, Technicals: Non-Standard Tactical Vehicles from the Great Toyota War to modern Special Forces (2018), p. 41. =South Korean= KM-410 and Keohwa M-5GA1 versions produced in South Korea.

History The land originally was purchased in 1856 by Eilley and her second husband Alex Cowan, who returned to Utah a year later with other Mormon settlers. Eilley secured a divorce and moved to Gold Hill where she ran a boarding house and took in washing. Some miners, unable to pay for lodging and laundry with cash, gave Eilley Orrum pieces of their mining claims in payment.

It was modeled after a design conceived by Eilley based on her recollection of elegant buildings in her native Scotland. Indeed, the Bowers employed stonecutters from Scotland for the construction of their new home, which eventually cost $300,000 to build, an exorbitant sum in the 1860s. Eilley and Sandy toured Europe from 1861 to 1863, purchasing furniture, statuary, paintings and other adornments for their home. Unfortunately, during one of these trips abroad, Eilley Bowers's only child, a daughter named Pearl, died. The mansion in 2012 Following the death of Sandy Bowers in 1868, Eilley fell on hard financial times. She generated income by renting out rooms in the mansion and hosting parties and picnics on the grounds. The mansion hosted a ball for the women's suffrage movement and was the location of the annual Miner's Ball. The period of 1873-75 was the height of the mansion's popularity. However, this was not enough to overcome Eilley's debts and she finally lost her home to foreclosure in 1876. The mansion was abandoned by the time Henry Riter acquired it and operated it as a resort until 1946. Today The building is currently owned and operated by the Washoe County Parks Department. Some 500 Nevada families have donated period furniture housed in the mansion. The park blends the historical site with recreational facilities such as a spring-fed swimming pool, picnic areas, and a playground. Tours of the mansion are given in summer and autumn. Hot springs The thermal spring waters are 116¬∞F and are cooled to 83¬∞ in the pool.

It is situated between the towns of Tullamore and Portarlington on the R420 regional road. Geashill has a Church of Ireland church, a shop and petrol station, a post office, a school, a GAA club and two public houses. History The name Geashill is an anglicisation of the Irish name G√©isill. Older anglicisations include Geashil, Geshill, Geshell, Geisshell and Gessill.Placenames Database of Ireland (see archival records) Medieval Geashill An ancient place named Br√≠ Dam was situated in or near GeashillHogan E.

Br√≠ Dam; it boasted its own sacred tree () that was mentioned in Lives of Saint Patrick. Br√≠ Dam in 600 became the place of death of king of Uisnech (according to some sources - King of Ireland) Suibne mac Colm√°in, who was killed near an unidentified stream. An Anglo-Norman settlement was built here between 1185 and 1204 by the first Baron of Offaly, Gerald Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald, an ancestor of the Earls of Kildare. Originally of motte-and-bailey design, it was a timber castle on an earthen mound, nearby were located the church and tenant dwellings. In the 15th century the wooded fortress was replaced by a stone tower house. Today, only the west wall of the castle remains. In 1598, Lettice Fitzgerald, daughter and heir of Gerald, the Lord Offaly of the time, married a Robert Digby of Coleshill, Warwickshire, who was brother of the 1st Earl of Bristol and whose son was created Ist Baron Digby of Geashill in 1620. 19th century The triangular green in Geashill The Digbys developed Geashill as a planned estate village. Samuel Lewis, writing in 1837, described the village as containing 87 mostly thatched houses arranged around a triangular green.http://www.libraryireland.com/topog/g.php Fairs were held on 1 May, 6 October and December, the latter being one of the largest pig markets in Ireland. Consisting of over , the Digby estate was the largest in County Offaly. Edward St Vincent Digby, the 9th Baron Digby, came into the estate in 1856, but had no money to keep it. Consequently, he evicted a large number of families from their lands. A local priest, Father Patrick Dunne, arranged for 400 people to be taken to Australia on a ship named the Erin-go-Bragh, which took a record 25 weeks to reach Moreton Bay; 51 passengers died en route. Following the evictions, Digby carried out extensive improvements in the 1860s and 1870s and many of the current buildings around the triangular green date from this time. The Kings County Directory recorded that Digby had \\"converted the village of Geashill into what it now is, one of the neatest, cleanest and best kept in Ireland.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20071117033620/http://www.irishmidlandsancestry.com/content/offaly/community/kings- quinnsland.htm At the Paris Exhibition of 1867 Digby was awarded the bronze medal for models of the village he was building. He was awarded the gold medal for three years by the Royal Agricultural Society, for improving the greatest number of cottages in the best manner in the Province of Leinster. The Digbys built a house called Geashill Castle near the medieval tower house but this was burnt down during the Civil War in 1922. https://web.archive.org/web/20080627013908/http://www.r-alston.co.uk/ch_ire.htm Transport Geashill railway station opened on 2 October 1854, was closed for passenger traffic on 17 June 1963 and finally closed altogether on 30 August 1982.

Products like corncobs, feathers, soy, cottonseed hulls, peanut hulls, citrus pulp, screening, weeds, straw, and cereal by-products are often included as inexpensive fillers or low-grade fiber content. Although most plant-derived fibers have low nutritional value to companion animals (cats and dogs), there is scientific research showing that there are some physiological benefits such as aiding in stool formation in the colon, helping to develop proper fecal consistency, overall colon health, in addition to other health benefits such as reduced blood sugar uptake. According to critics [who?], many commercial pet foods contain fillers that have little or no nutritional value, but are added to decrease the overall cost of the food, especially when pet food manufacturers attempt to keep their pet foods at a desired price point despite rising manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and related costs. Critics [who?] allege that low-grade fiber fillers actually aggravate the intestinal walls instead of promoting health, and that carnivores such as cats are not able to effectively digest plant-derived fibers in their hindgut. In rare cases, contaminated fillers have led to large-scale recalls at significant expense to the pet food companies. Two examples are aflatoxin on corn in the 2006 Diamond Dog Food Recall and melamine, which may have contaminated wheat gluten and other protein concentrates in the 2007 pet food recalls.

In mathematics, in the field of ordinary differential equations, Sturm separation theorem, named after Jacques Charles Fran√ßois Sturm, describes the location of roots of solutions of homogeneous second order linear differential equations. Basically the theorem states that given two linear independent solutions of such an equation the zeros of the two solutions are alternating.  Sturm separation theorem  Given a homogeneous second order linear differential equation and two continuous linear independent solutions u(x) and v(x) with x0 and x1 successive roots of u(x), then v(x) has exactly one root in the open interval (x0, x1). It is a special case of the Sturm-Picone comparison theorem.  Proof  Since \\\\displaystyle u and \\\\displaystyle v are linearly independent it follows that the Wronskian \\\\displaystyle W[u,v] must satisfy W[u,v](x)\\\\equiv W(x) eq 0 for all \\\\displaystyle x where the differential equation is defined, say \\\\displaystyle I. Without loss of generality, suppose that W(x)<0\\\\mbox{ }\\\\forall\\\\mbox{ }x\\\\in I. Then :u(x)v'(x)-u'(x)v(x) eq 0. So at \\\\displaystyle x=x_0 :W(x_0)=-u'\\\\left(x_0\\\\right)v\\\\left(x_0\\\\right) and either u'\\\\left(x_0\\\\right) and v\\\\left(x_0\\\\right) are both positive or both negative. Without loss of generality, suppose that they are both positive. Now, at \\\\displaystyle x=x_1 :W(x_1)=-u'\\\\left(x_1\\\\right)v\\\\left(x_1\\\\right) and since \\\\displaystyle x=x_0 and \\\\displaystyle x=x_1 are successive zeros of \\\\displaystyle u(x) it causes u'\\\\left(x_1\\\\right)<0. Thus, to keep \\\\displaystyle W(x)<0 we must have v\\\\left(x_1\\\\right)<0. We see this by observing that if \\\\displaystyle u'(x)>0\\\\mbox{ }\\\\forall\\\\mbox{ }x\\\\in \\\\left(x_0,x_1\\\\right] then \\\\displaystyle u(x) would be increasing (away from the \\\\displaystyle x-axis), which would never lead to a zero at \\\\displaystyle x=x_1. So for a zero to occur at \\\\displaystyle x=x_1 at most u'\\\\left(x_1\\\\right)=0 (i.e., u'\\\\left(x_1\\\\right)\\\\leq 0 and it turns out, by our result from the Wronskian that u'\\\\left(x_1\\\\right)\\\\leq 0). So somewhere in the interval \\\\left(x_0,x_1\\\\right) the sign of \\\\displaystyle v(x) changed. By the Intermediate Value Theorem there exists x^*\\\\in\\\\left(x_0,x_1\\\\right) such that v\\\\left(x^*\\\\right)=0. On the other hand, there can be only one zero in \\\\left(x_0,x_1\\\\right), because otherwise v would have two zeros and there would be no zeros of u in between, and it was just proved that this is impossible.

Family and education John Ritchie Findlay was born in Edinburgh, the eldest son of J. Ritchie Findlay, of Aberlour, and Susan (n√©e Leslie). His father was a nephew of the founder of The Scotsman, so on his father's death in 1898, he became the principal partner in Messrs. John Ritchie and Co., the proprietors and publishers of The Scotsman and its associated newspapers. He was educated first at Mr Oliphant's School on Charlotte Square then the Edinburgh Collegiate School before going to Harrow School in 1879, where he was a contemporary of Stanley Baldwin and of John Galsworthy. From Harrow he passed to Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated MA with double honours, in Natural Science and in Literae Humaniores. Edinburgh University later gave him an honorary doctorate (LLD). He was a breeder of pedigree Aberdeen Angus cattle on his family estate at Aberlour. In 1898 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John McLaren, Lord McLaren, Sir Arthur Mitchell, Sir John Batty Tuke, and Ralph Copeland. He was Master of the Merchant Company of Edinburgh 1913-14. He sat on the Ancient Monuments Board and the Fine Art Commission for Scotland. He had a large private collection of scientific instruments. Findlay died at his residence, 3 Rothesay Terrace, Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1915-16 in Edinburgh, survived by his wife, three sons and two daughters. His heir was his eldest son Edmund Findlay. He is buried on the northern wall of the 20th-century extension to Dean Cemetery, Edinburgh in the modern equivalent of the \\"Lords Row\\" as found in the original cemetery. Family In 1901 he married Harriet Jane, daughter of Sir Jonathon Backhouse, of Darlington. Their eldest son was Edmund Findlay. Obituary Sir John Findlay was an enlightened and progressive newspaper proprietor with a high ideal of the moral responsibility of the Press to the public. His newspaper interests, however, absorbed only part of his activities. He never entered the competitive arena of local or national politics, but his services were much sought after on semi-public administrative boards and public committees, and he gave of himself in that work. Findlay was particularly interested in the furtherance and encouragement of art and archaeology, in which he followed in the footsteps of is father, the donor to the nation of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. Sir John was Chairman of the Board of Trustees for the National Galleries of Scotland, and for a long time Chairman of the Edinburgh College of Art. His antiquarian interests found an outlet in his position as Vice-Chairman of the Scottish Ancient Monuments Board, and he was also an original member of the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland. He gave useful service to Scottish education as a member of the Advisory Council to the Scottish Education Department, and he undertook a very heavy task a few years ago when he became Chairman of the Scottish Advisory Committee on the Rivers Pollution. On the outbreak of World War I he was invited by the Government to become Chairman of the Scottish National Housing Company, which was entrusted with the construction of housing at Rosyth, then the new naval base. Sir John's success in this enterprise led to his being asked by the last Unionist Government to form a company to accelerate house building in Scotland by the construction of steel houses. Many of these activities he was carrying on simultaneously ‚Äî a heavy burden even for a stronger man physically. He never complained, however and his ability and self-sacrificing zeal won him not only the admiration but the personal esteem and good will of is colleagues and all who were brought into contact with him. Reserved and reticent, he never sought publicity, but many knew him as the soul of honour and integrity, as a man on whose judgment and discretion they could implicitly rely. Lady Findlay ably supported her husband in his public work and was herself Chairman of the Scottish Unionist Association two years ago, the first woman to hold that office. Sir John was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1917 and created a Baronet, of Aberlour in the County of Banff, in 1925. After fulfilling the role of Deputy Lieutenant, in 1928 he was appointed to Lord Lieutenant of Banffshire, the county in which Aberlour, the family estate is situated. He was an honorary Royal Scottish Academy and an honorary LL.D. of Edinburgh University.

It has absorbed the villages of Baldersbr√∏nde and Fl√∏ng and almost merged with Roskilde's eastern Trekroner neighbourhood to the west and Taastrup to the east. To the south is the large recreational area Hedeland. As of 1 January 2020, the town had a population of 12,265.BY3: Population 1 January, by urban areas The Mobile Statbank from Statistics Denmark A large development project, N√¶rHeden, created as a collaboration between H√∏je-Taastrup Municipality and Realdania, will expand the town to the southeast with a new sustainable neighbourhood. History The locality in 1649 The flat and fertile moraine landscape between Roskilde, K√∏ge and Copenhagen was since the Middle Ages known as Hedeboegnen or simply Heden (\\"The Heath\\"). The name was merely a reference to the flat and open character of the landscape at a time when much of Denmark was covered by forest while it was not covered by heath in the ecological sense of the word. Villages in the area included Fl√∏ng, Kallerrup, Baldersbr√∏nde and Marbjerg. A road had since the 13th century connected Copenhagen and Roskilde. In 1641, Christian IV ordered the construction of a new, private road, Roskilde Kongevej, a so-called kongevej, which was completed in 1642. A house known as Kongens Hedehus (\\"The King's Heath House\\"), often referred to simply as Hedehuset (\\"The Heath House\\") built for a Vogt (foged) who was responsible for overseeing that only royalty or people authorized by the king used the road. He was instructed to prosecute trespassers and shoot their horses. A special key was made for the gate at the Heath House and another one for the gate at R√∏de Port (\\"Red Gate\\") in Roskilde. The house was located where Tv√¶rvej 1 in Hedehusene is today. In 1658, the Heath House was converted into an inn after the road was opened to other travellers at the end of the Swedish Wars. It was joined by two more inns at the site in 1682 and 1702. They initially operated without licenses since they were located too close to Roskilde to obtain a royal privilege. From 1733, they were licensed on condition that all beer and Akvavit was purchased in Roskilde and that they paid a tax of 4 rigsdaler to the city. Roskilde Kongevej gradually fell into despair and two of the inns had to close when the new Roskildevej opened in 1776. Hedehusene Station opened when the Copenhagen-Roskilde Railway Line was inaugurated in 1847. The station was only built because the steam locomotives had to make frequent stops for water. In 1892, one of the local farms, Hedehusg√•rden, was purchased by an engineer who established several gravel pits on the land. Hedehus Brickyard was founded by F. L. Schmidt in 1896. Danmark closed in 1970 and Hedehus Brickyard in 1980. From the 187+s, considerable redevelopment of the area has taken place with housing. N√¶rHeden development project A new neighbourhood, N√¶rheden, is planned in the southwestern outskirts of Hedehusene. It is the result of a collaboration between H√∏je-Taastrup Municipality and Realdania and will consist approximately 4,500 homes. The competition to design the masterplan was won by a team led by Arkitema Architects in 2014. The plan includes a number of varied housing clusters and public spaces arranged along a recreational loop. Economy Hedehusene is home to several large companies. Rockwool International is a major manufacturer of mineral wool. The logistics company DSV moved its global headquarters to Hedehusene in 2014. It consists of a office building and a logistics terminal. Landmarks=Churches Fl√∏ng Church There are two churches in Hedehusene. Fl√∏ng Church dates from the middle of the 12th century and was built by members of the Snubbe family, a branch of the powerful Hvide dynasty residing at Bytteborg. The church originally consisted of chancel and nave under a flat roof. The tower was already added to its western end in approximately 1200. The height of the tower was increased with 19 metres in the 16th century. A porch was also constructed on the north side and a new roof with cross vaults was added. The original chancel was torn down in about 1500. Ansgar's Church in the modern part of Hedehusene was inaugurated in 1921. It was designed by Frederik Appel. The Kallerup Stone The Kallerup Stone The cemetery at Ansgar's Church features the Kallerup Stone, one of the oldest runestones found in Denmark. It dates from the early Viking period (c. 800 to 825) and was discovered by a stonemason on a field at Kollerup in 1869. Hedeland The vast recreational area Hedeland has an area of 15 square kilometres. It is home to a wide selection of recreational facilities, including a golf course, a kart circuit, a vintage railway, equestrian centre, amphi theatre and fishing ponds. Transport Hedehusene station is served by regional trains between Copenhagen and Ringsted. Travel times by train are 20-23 minutes to Copenhagen Central Station and seven minutes to Roskilde station. The Holb√¶k Motorway (M11, part of Danish national road 21) runs north of Hedehusene and has exits at Baldersbr√∏nde and Fl√∏ng.

She is known as an early pioneer in computer science.  Education and career Haibt studied mathematics at Vassar College with an academic scholarship. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1955. While at Vassar, Haibt worked at Bell Laboratories during the summer. Immediately after graduating from Vassar, Haibt began working at IBM. She started with an annual salary of $5,100, despite her lack of prior programming experience. This sum was almost double the amount that she would have made at Bell Laboratories. Haibt inferred that any job with such a high salary would be difficult, but fascinating. She was part of an academically diverse team of ten young people with varying academic degrees and unrelated areas of expertise, such as crystallography and cryptography. Experience with mathematics was their one common connection. Haibt was the only woman on the team. According to Haibt, the team worked well together: \\"No one was worried about seeming stupid or possessive of his or her code. We were all just learning together.\\" The FORTRAN team worked nontraditional hours so that they could have unlimited access to the IBM 704 computer. They frequently rented rooms at the nearby Langdon Hotel in order to sleep during the day and work at night. In 1957, Haibt attended Columbia University. Haibt is a member of the Mathematical Association of America. Research contributions The IBM team spent almost three years creating the programming language FORTRAN, which reformed the way people communicate instructions to computers. Haibt was in charge of section four of the FORTRAN project. She analyzed the flow of programs produced by other sections of the compiler. Her estimates of flow in high-traffic areas of the computer were obtained by calculating how often basic blocks of the program would execute. Haibt employed Monte Carlo methods (statistical analysis) for these calculations. Through this process, she also created the first syntactic analyzer of arithmetic expressions. Haibt planned and programmed the entire section. Haibt was also part of an eleven-person team to develop and release the first reference manual for FORTRAN in 1956. Personal life Lois Haibt was married to Luther Haibt (May 4, 1929 ‚Äì December 3, 2000), a systems analyst at IBM in Thornwood, NY. The Haibts spent their adult lives in New York state. Haibt's daughter, Carolyn, attended Princeton University for her bachelor's degree and went on to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Licensed to Gadsden, Alabama, United States, the station is currently owned by iHeartMedia, Inc.. Overnight, the station broadcasts the syndicated Coast to Coast AM hosted by George Noory. Morning talk show host Dave Mack is a frequent guest/commentator on Nancy Grace's weeknight talk show on HLN. History The station began operation in 1947 as WGWD, also at 570 on the dial, but with a power of 1,000 watts, daytime only. WGWD was owned by the Covington family of Montgomery, Alabama. In its early days the station operated from studios located in the original Pioneer Life Insurance building in downtown Gadsden. In 1955, the station was bought by Atlanta broadcaster Charles A. Smithgall, who had enjoyed great success on WSB in that city. Smithgall changed the calls to WCAS, raised the power level to 5,000 watts in 1959 and continued to operate the station status quo until 1960. By then the radio business in Gadsden had grown to such a level as another full-time station was needed. Smithgall hired Calvin Williamson to install a three tower directional array on what was a cow pasture on Rainbow Drive, just north of the Gadsden Country Clubs' golf course. In later years this would prove a great location, as the city grew south, traveling down Rainbow Drive. In the process, he also changed the call letters to WAAX. The location and set-up of the towers proved sufficient to put the signal into Georgia and Tennessee. The new WAAX became a CBS affiliate, and programmed light pop music during the day, and ran a list of CBS programs at night. In 1962, Mike McDougald of Georgia, also a WSB alum, bought into the station, and became its general manager. McDougald continued the light pop sound during the day, but hired a young Mike Morelock to become the night time top 40 jock on \\"BIG WAAX\\". In the months to come, the station gained the image as the news leader, as McDougald outfitted the station vehicle with police and fire radios, and installed one of the first \\"car phones\\" in the area, actually a two-way radio that could call any telephone number from the road. From the late 1950s through early 1963, Robert Allen Chumley Sr. was the news reporter, air-time salesman, and later on, night-time classical music host for WAAX. At the time of this change, the music schedule was Country music in the morning and Top 40 in the afternoon, with Classical music being added for Sunday nights. He covered various events such as shopping center openings, horse shows, etc. But the main ongoing agenda was the Civil Rights Movement where he covered church civil-rights meetings, KKK rallies, and protests, and interviewed such notables as Martin Luther King, Jr., Ralph Abernathy, Marlon Brando, Harry Belafonte, and others for the station. These two antagonistic groups, the segregationists and integrationists alike, respected Chumley, and by virtue WAAX, for thorough and impartial news reporting. There were also threats from extremists on both sides by phone as well as automobile. Such was the atmosphere that Bob, as people called him, operated within as he was sent by the station to Montgomery to cover such events as the gubernatorial polls with a focus on George C. Wallace (who incidentally ran on an education platform against segregationist John Patterson). Due to such assignments in Gadsden and abroad, WAAX gained recognition with national news organizations through Bob‚Äôs coverage of such national issues as well as his association with Clancy Lake of WAPI in Birmingham as well as with those of WSFA television in Montgomery. Mike McDougald was very supportive of his staff during this tumultuous period; such as, when Chumley covered the showing of the movie To Kill A Mockingbird. Bob Chumley, by his and his wife‚Äôs own record collection, brought Gadsden a refined program of the arts through a far-sighted incorporation of high art into the general format of a top 40/news station. Such was the open mindedness of Mike McDougald, who allowed his staff to flex their own creativeness and idiosyncrasies which gave WAAX its prestige. Bob gave his news style and Classical music; Mike Morelock, his love of Rock and riding motorcycles wearing a German army helmet; and Mike McDougald, his sense of humor (as with his beebee rifle in the corner for the station's protection) as well as his concern for and support of his staff. In 1973, Dave Fitz came to WAAX as Executive News Director, Quickly he became the news authority for the region. Fitz remained with WAAX for 25 years. With his easily recognizable voice and no-nonsense delivery, Fitz was regarded as the radio news guy in Gadsden for over 30 years (Fitz died on August 9, 2009) The station gained popularity and in 1967 programmed modern country while still playing top 40 at night. With a booming signal, the station slogan became, BIG WAAX, the station you hear, everywhere. When FM became the dominant force for music on the radio, WAAX became and remains a news-talk station to this day. In 1998, PD Bill Seckbach and GM Kathy Boggs brought the sounds of Rush Limbaugh, Paul Finebaum, and J. Holland to the \\"Big WAAX\\".

It was previously known as the Brunswick Formation since it was first described in the vicinity of New Brunswick, New Jersey. It is now named for the city of Passaic, New Jersey, which is near where its type section was described by paleontologist Paul E. Olsen. Description The Passaic is defined as a reddish-brown shale, siltstone and mudstone with a few green and brown shale interbeds; red and dark-gray interbedded argillites near the base.Berg, T.M., Edmunds, W.E., Geyer, A.R. and others, compilers, (1980). Geologic Map of Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, Map 1, scale 1:250,000. In New Jersey, there are conglomerate and sandstone beds within the formation. Depositional environment The Passaic is mostly shallow lakes, playa, and alluvial fan deposits resulting from the rifting of Pangea. The red color is often evidence that the sediments were deposited in arid conditions.Faill, R.T., (2004). The Birdsboro Basin. Pennsylvania Geology V. 34 n. 4. The Passaic Formation overlies the Lockatong Formation deep lake sediment cycles, which were deposited during wetter climatic cycles during the Late Triassic. These sediments came from the northwest and contain clasts from Appalachian formations. Fossils=Age The Passaic is Late Triassic with an astronomically calibrated age of 219 to 201.7 million years ago (Ma) and is about 13,000 ft (~4 km) thick in the basin depocenter. It conformably overlies the Lockaton Formation (darker, generally gray shales and mudrocks) and is overlain by the first Watching(Orange Mountain Formation) basalt. The Triassic/Jurassic boundary and correlated by pollen is located in the uppermost part of the formation, ~ 2 precessional cycles (~10-12 m) below the Orange Mountain Basalt. There are numerous diabase intrusions into the Passaic with local contact metamorphic rocks.Berg, T.M., et al., (1983).

Due to financial problems, it ended broadcasting on 1 April 2003. With the help of the private company Antena 1 and of the owner of Polsat, Zygmunt Solorz-≈ªak, TV Puls resumed broadcasting in June 2003. Until recently, the station's programming was largely devoted to Catholic issues, as the majority of the company's stock was owned by the Franciscan Order. In 2006 News Corporation acquired 35% of the stock and began a major overhaul of the programming. On 28 October 2007, the channel were revised with a new logo and a more mainstream target group, as well as it starts to broadcast a new information program: Puls Raport. However, on 16 July 2008, it was decided to remove the program from the schedule, and the reason for this decision was the poor audience share results and the excessively high costs of production. Later on 3 November 2008, it was announced that News Corporation has sold its 35% stake to the remaining shareholders. The channel develops. It gives many entertainment programs, series and documentaries. TV Puls in June 2010 received a license to broadcast channel for children and young people Puls 2 (launched on 19 July 2012).

Holb√∏ll served as Royal Inspector of Colonies and Whaling in North Greenland (1825‚Äì1828), then Inspector of South Greenland (1828‚Äì1856). While in this post he became interested in natural history. His main contribution was to send large amounts of faunistic collections to the zoologists in Copenhagen. For example, professor Johannes Theodor Reinhardt described the North American form of the red-necked grebe and named it Podiceps holboellii (now Podiceps grisegena holboellii). Holb√∏ll himself also wrote a treatise on Greenlandic birds.Holb√∏ll, C.P. (1843) Ornithologiske Bidrag til den gr√∏nlandske Fauna (Ornithological Contributions to the Greenlandic Fauna).

In the paper, he described the hoary redpoll (Linota hornemanni, now known as Carduelis hornemanni), which he named for the botanist Jens Wilken Hornemann. Hornemann had previously received plant collections from Holb√∏ll and named a new species Arabis holboellii (now known as Boechera holboellii). Holb√∏ll was also a skilled amateur botanist and entomologist. He wrote a school book for mathematics teaching in Greenland, which was used for about a century.

It was shortlisted for the 2007 Carnegie Medal. The American Library Association named it as one of the Best Books for Young Adults in 2007. Plot The Road of the Dead opens as 14-year-old Ruben and 17-year-old Cole, half gypsy half English brothers, learn about their older sister's rape and murder. Determined to bring closure to their family, they travel to Lychcombe to collect her body. What begins as a simple task to bring her body home branches out into a quest for revenge when they learn that the murderer must be caught before they can bury Rachel. Slowly the brothers begin to uncover a plot in Lychcombe, involving the planned installation of a new hotel and vacation resort and several landowners who don't want to sell. Tragically, they discover that Rachel's murder was the result of an accident/miscommunication. However, the brothers are still determined to find and catch her killer. When the brothers discover that the killer has already been murdered himself for his mistake, they set out to find his body, the only way they can link him to Rachel. They soon find themselves involved with local gypsies, small town politics and the town's unofficial leader who's not going to give in without a fight. Meaning of the title While Ruben is talking to a local girl, he inquires where his sister's body was found. The girl leads him down an old path to where the body was located by a forestry worker the day after her murder. As they travel, she explains that in Gaelic the name translates to the Road of the Dead because funeral parties would carry the dead down the path. Praise \\"The Road of the Dead\\" currently (March 2007) has a rating of 4.5 stars out of 5 on amazon.com. reviewers on the site have praised the book as \\"crisp and natural, and often funny and touching at once.\\" Another reviewer described the book as a \\"heart-pounding, deeply emotional story with strong characters.\\" On another site, teensread.com, the review (Alexis Burling) praised the book as \\"an exhilarating ride that teens won't soon forget.\\" She also wrote that the novel \\"barrels its way towards another Kevin Brooks signature explosive climax, leaving nothing and no one untouched when the dust finally settles.\\" Criticism Criticism on amazon.com writes that The Road of the Dead finishes up too quickly, pointing out that \\"the question of how Cole comes upon a key piece of evidence is brushed away with Ruben's comment, \\"Does it matter?\\" Readers have sat through a lot of brutality (albeit strikingly written brutality) to get that information, so the answer is, well, yeah, it does.\\" Other readers and commenters have noted that the book contains \\"an overwhelming presence of seriously graphic violence throughout that certainly may not sit well with some parents\\" (From teensread.com). Another reader writes that at times \\"it was a little gross but not in a disturbing or sexual way,\\" while still giving it five stars.

He is sometimes called Niddanus from the name of his birthplace, Nidda in Hesse. Life His father was a well-known Protestant minister, Johann Pistorius the Elder (died 1583 at Nidda). From 1541 he was superintendent or chief minister of Nidda, and took part in several religious disputations between Catholics and Protestants. Pistorius the Younger studied theology, law, and medicine at Marburg and Wittenberg 1559-67. He received the degree of Doctor of Medicine, and in 1575 was appointed court physician to the Margrave Karl II of Baden- Durlach, who frequently sought his advice in political and theological matters. Pistorius turned from Lutheranism to Calvinism; through his influence the Margrave Ernst Friedrich of Baden-Durlach made the same change. As time went on, however, Pistorius became dissatisfied with Calvinism also. In 1584 he became a privy councillor of Margrave James III of Baden-Hochberg at Emmendingen; after further investigation he entered the Catholic Church in 1588. At his request the Margrave James brought about the religious disputations of Baden, 1589, and Emmendingen, 1590. After the second disputation the court preacher Johannes Zehender and the margrave himself became Catholics. James III, however, died on 17 August 1590, and being succeeded by his Protestant brother Ernst Friedrich, Pistorius was obliged to leave. He went to Freiburg, became a priest in 1591, then vicar-general of Constance until 1594; after this he was an imperial councillor, cathedral provost of Breslau, Apostolic prothonotary, and in 1601 confessor to the Emperor Rudolph II. After his death his library came into the possession of the Jesuits of Molsheim and later was transferred to the theological seminary at Strasburg. He died in Freiburg. Works Pistorius published a detailed account of the conversion of Margrave James III: \\"Jakobs Marggrafen zu Baden ... christliche, erhebliche und wolfundirte Motifen\\" (Cologne, 1591). His numerous writings against Protestantism, while evincing clearness, skill, and thorough knowledge of his opponents, especially of Luther, are marked by controversial sharpness and coarseness. The most important are: \\"Anatomia Lutheri\\" (Cologne, 1595-8);\\"Hochwichtige Merkzeichen des alten und neuen Glaubens\\" (M√ºnster, 1599); \\"Wegweiser vor alle verf√ºhrte Christen\\" (M√ºnster, 1599). Pistorius was attacked violently by the Protestants; e. g., by Samuel Huber, Cyriakus Spangenberg, Balthasar Mentzer, Horstius, and Christoph Agricola. Replies to the \\"Anatomia Lutheri\\" were written by the Protestant theologians of Wittenberg and Hesse. Pistorius also busied himself with cabalistic studies, and published \\"Artis cabbalistic√¶, h. e. recondit√¶ theologi√¶ et philosophi√¶ scriptorum tomus unus\\" (Basle, 1587). As court historiographer to the Margrave of Baden, he investigated the genealogy of the princely House of Z√§hringen; he also issued two works on historical sources: \\"Polonic√¶ histori√¶ corpus, i. e. Polonicarum rerum latini veteres et recentiores scriptores quotquot exstant\\" (Basle, 1582), and \\"Rerum Germanicarum veteres jam primum publicati scriptores aliquot insignes medii √¶vi ad Carolum V\\" (Frankfort, 1583‚Äì1607).

The park is located in the municipalities of Hol (Viken county), Ulvik and Aurland (both in Vestland county). More precisely, the park comprises the Hallingskarv plateau and the high mountain areas to the west of it. It includes the Vargebreen glacier as well as the valleys of S√•tedalen, Lengjedalen, Ynglesdalen, and parts of Raggsteindalen. The national park covers of the Hallingskarvet mountain range and hosts large stocks of wild reindeer, an important factor in the establishment of the park. The highest point in the national park is Folarskardnuten which reaches an elevation of above sea level. The landscape of Hallingskarvet was shaped by multiple ice ages. The park shows the geological history and the connection between this history and the variation in the species living there. It includes areas of special value and which are home to threatened or vulnerable species such as Draba cacuminum (whitlow- grass) and Botrychium lanceolatum (lance-leaf grapefern). The Bergen Line runs along the southern boundary of the park. There is no road access to the southern side of the park, so Finse Station, a stop on the railway line, is one of the few ways that people can access this part of the park. The Norwegian County Road 50 runs near the northern boundary of the park. Protection and use The main objective of this national park is to preserve a large, unique, and largely untouched area in order to protect the landscape and the biome with its ecosystem, species and populations of, amongst others, the wild reindeer. The protection is designed to safeguard a characteristic element needed to understand the geological history of the Norwegian landscape. It is also designed to protect valuable elements of the cultural heritage. The park is open to the traditional forms of outdoor activities which require little or no technical means.

According to a 2007 newspaper report,March 20, 2007 Source Columba (Latin columba, \\"pigeon\\") was the code name for the Confidential Pigeon Service, an unconventional British intelligence gathering operation in World War II. It involved air-dropping homing pigeons behind enemy lines in German-occupied France and the Netherlands as a means for locals to convey information, such as troop movements, to British intelligence. From 1940 onwards, hundreds of pigeon cases were parachuted into Europe, each case including ‚Äì apart from the pigeon ‚Äì sheets of very thin paper, a special pencil and a tube for storing the message, as well as French and Dutch instructions on how to fill in a report. A recent copy of a London newspaper was also included as proof of good faith. In 1944, prior to the imminent Allied invasion, German counterintelligence sought to counteract (or co-opt) Source Columba by dropping pigeons of their own. These pigeon cases, accompanied by a packet of English cigarettes, were purporting to be British also and carried instructions to communicate the names of the local patriots to the Allies. The R√©sistance, for its part, let it be known that the best way to deal with these false birds would be to smoke the cigarettes and eat the pigeons. Despite such interference, the operation was reported to have been remarkably successful, yielding useful intelligence in over fifty percent of the received messages. 31 Source Columba pigeons eventually received the Dickin Medal, the highest British military decoration for animals. The operation became public only after National Archives files relating to it were released in 2007. However the method and a few actual cases were described in some detail in Dr R.V.

Cochiti Dam is one of the four United States Army Corps of Engineers projects for flood and sediment control on the Rio Grande system, operating in conjunction with Abiquiu Dam, Galisteo Dam and Jemez Canyon Dam. Description A view of the shoreline of Cochiti Lake, impounded by Cochiti Dam Cochiti Dam is primarily a flood control dam built to ameliorate the effects of heavy runoff. The dam and the resultant lake also had the secondary purposes of creating recreational and wildlife habitat resources. The outlet works of the dam have an outflow capacity of 14,790 feet3/s (418.8 m3/s).Upper Rio Grande Water Operations Model Physical Model Documentation: Third Technical Review Committee Draft (2005), 78. Cochiti Dam is operated to bypass all inflow to the lake to the extent that downstream channel conditions are capable of safely bypassing the flow. Flood-control operations are initiated when inflow to the lake is in excess of the downstream channel capacity. Stored floodwaters are released when downstream channel conditions permit, all in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 86-645 and the Rio Grande Compact.Ibid., 79.

Archaeological surveys were made prior to filling of the lake. The filling of the lake inundated the Cochiti Diversion Dam which had previously been used for irrigation purposes, and which had been rehabilitated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation in 1958 as part of the Middle Rio Grande Project. The new dam replaced this functionality. Construction of the dam was opposed by the Cochiti Keres Pueblo Indians, who lost significant tracts of agricultural land as a result of the construction and subsequent pool filling. The Cochiti Keres filed a lawsuit against the Army Corps of Engineers regarding the inundation of their lands, winning the suit. In 2001, the Army Corps of Engineers made a public apology to the Cochiti Keres . Cochiti Lake Cochiti Lake has maintained a permanent recreation pool of approximately since the dam was completed.

The song was written on a train ride the pair took from Florida to Los Angeles in early 1968, and first appeared on The Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo album. Despite Buchanan's input, \\"Hickory Wind\\" is generally considered to be Parsons' signature song. Parsons' decision to play \\"Hickory Wind\\" instead of the planned Merle Haggard cover \\"Life in Prison\\" during The Byrds' performance at the Grand Ole Opry on March 15, 1968 \\"pissed off the country music establishment\\" and stunned Opry regulars to such an extent that the song is now considered essential to Parsons' legend. Johnny Rogan, in his book The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited, offers the following interpretation for the song: \\"The alluring 'Hickory Wind' serves as a powerful image for Parsons' bittersweet nostalgia, as he imagines an Edenic childhood of simple pleasures like climbing trees. During successive verses, he reflects on the pursuit of fame, the curse of wealth without spiritual satisfaction, and the perils of city life. What really makes the song, however, is Parsons' aching vocal performance, set against a superb steel guitar backing, whose whining combines with his yearning voice to create a mood of unbearable poignancy.\\" Chris Hillman, Parsons' partner in The Byrds and later The Flying Burrito Brothers, offers the following interpretation of the song: > It's his [Parsons'] signature song, just as 'I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better' > is Gene Clark's signature song. If Gram had never written another song, > \\"Hickory Wind\\" would have put him on the map. The song says it all ‚Äì it's > very descriptive, with vivid imagery. It's actually quite literary, but Gram > was, we know, was a very bright kid. If you know the guy's life story, > however he conjured up that scenario ‚Äì it's right at home. Gram was shuffled > off to a prep school, lots of money... that's a lonely song. He was a lonely > kid. Parsons first recorded \\"Hickory Wind\\" with The Byrds on March 9, 1968, at Columbia Records' Nashville recording studios during sessions for the Sweetheart of the Rodeo album. The song features the noted session musicians Lloyd Green on pedal steel guitar and John Hartford on fiddle. In addition, Parsons plays acoustic guitar and piano, with bass, banjo and drums being played by Chris Hillman, Roger McGuinn and Kevin Kelley respectively. Although the song is often regarded as one of the best of Parsons' career, it was not released as a single. The song was re-recorded for Parsons' 1974 album, Grievous Angel, as part of the \\"Medley Live from Northern Quebec\\", along with the song \\"Cash on the Barrelhead\\". Authorship controversy In 2002, an article on the website www.folklinks.com controversially claimed that \\"Hickory Wind\\" wasn't, in fact, written by Gram Parsons, but by Sylvia Sammons‚Äîa blind folksinger from Greenville, South Carolina‚Äîwith Bob Buchanan later contributing an additional verse. Sammons' alleged authorship of the song was first made public by traditional musician Kay Justice during a performance at a small church concert in southwest Virginia. Additionally, L. Beatrice Hutzler, a former professor at Clinch Valley College (now the University of Virginia's College at Wise), recalled that she too had heard Sammons sing the song in person prior to its being recorded by The Byrds. When interviewed in 2002, Sammons claimed that she had written the song and that she regularly performed \\"Hickory Wind\\" at coffeehouses and other folk venues in Greenville during 1963‚Äîa time when Parsons was also performing in Greenville with his band The Shilos‚Äîand that her song was stolen during this period. She further claims that in 1969 she reached a cash settlement with a music publisher for the rights to \\"Hickory Wind\\" and agreed to turn over a tape-recorded copy of the song, which was her only physical proof of authorship. Sammons' claim to the song has been rebutted by both Bob Buchanan and Chris Hillman, with the latter stating \\"As far as I know Gram and Bob Buchanan did indeed write 'Hickory Wind'. As unstable as Gram was in my brief time with him on this earth, I sincerely doubt he was a plagiarist in any of his songwriting endeavors unless his co-writer Bob brought him the idea.\\" Although many people have chosen to dismiss Sammons' claim, citing a lack of any physical proof on her part, the controversy surrounding the authorship of \\"Hickory Wind\\" remains. Calling her claim further into doubt, it appears that in a 1993 Orlando Sentinel article, a woman with the same name, Sylvia Sammons, stated she was a blind, 42 year old folk singer from a small town in North Carolina, who had been performing \\"for 12 years on the coffeehouse circuit,\\" or since 1981; this would have made her aged 12-13, living in a different state, and nearly 20 years away from her first performance on \\"the coffeehouse circuit\\" at the time she later claimed to have written the song.https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os- xpm-1993-02-13-9302121260-story.html Covers \\"Hickory Wind\\" was covered by Joan Baez on her 1969 release, David's Album. Parsons' friend and one-time musical partner Emmylou Harris also covered it on her 1979 album Blue Kentucky Girl. Richard Thompson, Clive Gregson, and Christine Collister also recorded a cover of the song for the 1989 Byrds' tribute album, Time Between ‚Äì A Tribute to The Byrds. Grant Lee Phillips recorded his cover version for his Virginia Creeper album. The Seldom Scene covered \\"Hickory Wind\\" on the live album Blue Grass: The Greatest Show On Earth recorded at a concert in 1980 and released in 1986 with members of The Country Gentlemen and J. D. Crowe and the New South. Ryan Adams & the Cardinals covered the song numerous times in concert. Lucinda Williams has covered the song twice: once on \\"Cayamo: Sessions at Sea\\", an album by Buddy Miller and again on a tribute album to Harris entitled: \\"The Life & Songs of Emmylou Harris\\".

It is commonly used in Brazil, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Portugal, and other Portuguese-speaking places. Bairro is cognate with Germanic berg, burg, borg, burgh, borough etc., and Spanish barrio, all of which descend from the same Proto-Indo European root. In Brazil, the word is frequently applied to urban areas in cities, in which the bairros are generally defined only unofficially and have rough borders, without any official administrative function. In some cities, however, the bairros have defined territorial limits set by the municipal government, but most follow popular definition by its citizens. In Portugal, the word is used with the same meaning as in Brazil, defining a non administrative urban area, frequently without clear borders, an example being the Bairro Alto in Lisbon. Occasionally, a Portuguese bairro can coincide with an administrative freguesia (civil parish). In the past, the cities of Lisbon and Porto were divided in large administrative divisions - each encompassing several freguesias - which were also named bairros. In Mozambique, bairros are administrative subdivisions of urban districts with important functions in the identification of the residents and determine the attributes of the area in regard to construction or agriculture, much like zoning. They are directed by secret√°rios. In Guinea-Bissau, bairros are first the peri-urban quarters of the capital Bissau beyond the old city centre (Pra√ßa), e.g. Bairro de Ajuda, Bairro Militar, Pessak, Quelele, Luanda, Mpantcha, and by extension quarters of smaller towns throughout the country.

Girolamo Seripando (Troja, Apulia, 6 May 1493 ‚Äì Trento, 17 March 1563) was an Augustinian friar, Italian theologian and cardinal. Life He was of noble birth, and intended by his parents for the legal profession. After their death, however, at the age of fourteen, he entered the Augustinian Order, at Viterbo, where he studied of Greek and Hebrew as well as philosophy and theology. After a short stay in Rome, where he had been called by his superior general, he was appointed lecturer at Siena (1515), professor of theology at Bologna (1517), and vicar- general (1532), a role he filled with great credit for two years. He won such a reputation for eloquence by his discourses in the principal cities of Italy, that the Emperor Charles V often made it a point to be present at his sermons. Elected superior general in 1539, he governed for twelve years, with singular prudence, zeal, and piety. He attended (1546) the sessions of the Council of Trent, where he distinguished himself by his zeal for the purity of the text of Holy Writ, and also by his peculiar views concerning original sin and justification. Pope Paul III sent him as his legate to the emperor and to the King of France, after which he was offered the Bishopric of Aquila. Seripando not only declined this dignity, but even resigned his position as superior general (1551), and withdrew into a small convent. He was called from this retirement (1553) on a mission from the city of Naples to Charles V. Upon completion of this he was appointed Archbishop of Salerno. He proved a zealous and efficient pastor. A few years later (1561), Pope Pius IV made him cardinal and second legate of the Holy See at the Council of Trent. Upon the death of Cardinal Gonzaga, he became first president of the same Council. Works Seripando was an elegant and prolific writer, and a vigorous controversialist, rather than an orator. The following are his principal published works: \\"Novae constitutiones ordinis S. Augustini\\" (Venice, 1549); \\"Oratio in funere Caroli V imperatoris\\" (Naples, 1559); \\"Prediche sopra il simbolo degli Apostoli, etc.\\" (Venice, 1567); \\"Commentarius in D.

Pauli epistolas ad Romanos et ad Galatas\\" (Naples, 1601); \\"De arte orandi\\" (Lyons, 1670); and several of his letters, included by Lagomarsini in \\"Poggiani epist. et orationes\\" (Rome, 1762).

The result was a Byzantine victory. Origins of the conflict After the success in the battle of the Rishki Pass (759) the Bulgarian Khan Vinekh showed surprising inaction and instead desired peace, which cost him the throne and his life. The new ruler, Telets, was a firm supporter for further military actions against the Byzantines. With his heavy cavalry he looted the border regions of the Byzantine Empire and on 16 June 763, Constantine V came out of Constantinople with a large army and a fleet of 800 ships, with 12 cavalrymen on each.  The battle  The energetic Bulgarian Khan barred the mountain passes and took advantageous positions on the heights near Anchialus, but his self-confidence and impatience incited him to go down to the lowlands and charge the enemy. The battle started at 10 in the morning and lasted until sunset. It was long and bloody, but in the end the Byzantines were victorious, although they lost many soldiers, nobles, and commanders. The Bulgarians also had heavy casualties and many were captured, while Telets managed to escape.  Aftermath  Constantine V entered his capital in triumph and then killed the prisoners. The fate of Telets was similar: two years later he was murdered because of the defeat. The Byzantines failed to use the strategic advantage which they had and the prolonged wars in the 8th century ended in 792 at the Marcelae with a Bulgarian victory and reestablishment of the treaty of 718.

History Established in 1936 by two brothers, Julius and Gilbert Durst, who were enthusiasts in the field of photography, encouraged by their mother, who was also a keen photographer and had her own darkroom. Products A Durst F60 enlarger Durst ended production of their enlargers in late 2006 due to a drop in sales, probably due to growth of minilabs and later digital imaging. In the 70 years of manufacturing enlargers their sales peaked in 1979 with 107,000 sold. Durst have filed over 500 patents for various components and designs of enlargers. Now, Durst produce a range of photochemical (Durst Lambda and Theta printers) and super wide format inkjet printers based on UV polymerization ink technology. The quality of the output of these products is exceptional, as was the case with the company's historical enlargers, for high quality image reproduction and high versatility of application, from paper and plastic materials to ceramics and wood. Lambda and Theta photographic printers The Durst Lambda and Theta models are widely used in the photographic printing industry to produce digital C-Type prints on light sensitive colour and monochrome papers and transparency display materials such as Kodak Duratrans and Duraclear. Images are produced by exposing light sensitive material with RGB laser light which is then developed through the relevant chemical process. The Lambda is a standalone machine the requires a separate chemical processor and takes a roll of paper wide, whereas the Theta uses a roll measuring and has its chemical processor built in. The Theta is also capable of holding two different paper types at once. Durst inkjet printers Durst expanded in 2003 into UV Curable Digital Inkjet Printers with the Rho 160, and now produces a full line of Large Format, Textile, Ceramic, Label and Industrial Inkjet printers for a variety of applications. The Durst Rho 500 Roll-to-Roll Printer and the Durst Rho P10-250 Flatbed Printer have both won \\"Product of the Year\\" at the Specialty Graphics Industry Association Awards.

Founded in 2003 by Jack Wong, Meizu began as a manufacturer of MP3 players and later MP4 players. In 2008, Meizu moved its focus to smartphones. Meizu is the 11th largest smartphone manufacturer in the world, and sold over 20 million units in 2015. In February 2015, Alibaba invested US$590 million in Meizu, acquiring an undisclosed minority stake. History Jack Wong () established Meizu in 2003. Initially a manufacturer of MP3 players, Meizu released their first MP4 player in 2006. Their most notable MP4 player was the M6 Mini Player, which was also marketed by Dane- Elec outside China. In April 2007, Meizu officially released the Meizu M8, drawing long queues in front of Meizu stores. The Meizu M8 was highly praised for its sound quality, performance and attractive price. Furthermore, it was one of the first phones to feature a capacitive touchscreen and ran on the Mymobile operating system, based on Microsoft Windows CE 6.0. An upgraded version of the Meizu M8, the Meizu M8SE, was released on October 2, 2009. On January 1, 2011, the company released the Meizu M9, their first smartphone based on the Android operating system. This device was considered to be a large commercial success in China. Meizu opened their first branch office outside mainland China in Hong Kong in 2011. Later that year, they also opened a branch office in Russia. The Meizu MX was released on January 1, 2012, exactly one year after the M9. It was the first smartphone to feature Meizu's Flyme OS, a deeply customized version of Android. It was the first Meizu phone officially released outside mainland China, being released in Hong Kong at the same time. A quad-core version of the Meizu MX was released in June 2012.

Following the murder of his brother, police detective Bill Bannister (Kent Taylor), his partner Tim Nolan (Robert Armstrong), and police chief Martin O'Brien (Joseph Crehan) focus investigation on the activities of Mortis and his gang, and discover that the crimes were all perpetrated by men who had died some time ago, with new identities and kept alive by a formula of Mortis's invention.

The directors were Ray Taylor, veteran director responsible for many hit serials, and Noel M. Smith, former silent-screen director who specialized in fast action (Smith directed many of Larry Semon's action-filled comedies of the 1920s). This is mostly a crime film but contains a small science fiction element. The villains, The League of Murdered Men, are all dead criminals killed and revived by Professor Mortis using his own mysterious poison. Critical reception The film was very successful in its original release, and was re-released in 1949 by Sherman S. Krellberg's Filmcraft Productions. Within serial fandom, Jim Harmon and Donald F. Glut in the 1970s described Gang Busters as a \\"well made and interesting serial.\\", and Cline in 1984 wrote that he considered the serial is one of Universal's best and that Professor Mortis is one of the best characters ever created for a serial.

He became a Presbyterian martyr in 1685. Among the numerous executions carried out by the government during The Killing Time of the 1680s, the allegations of brutality make this event one of the most controversial illustrations of the character of John Graham of Claverhouse, afterwards Viscount Dundee. Background George Harvey, Covenanters; Stirling Smith Art Gallery & Museum; Study for The Covenanters' Preaching George Harvey; The Covenanter's Preaching, 1830; Dundee Art Galleries and Museums Collection Alexander Johnston (1815‚Äì1891) Alexander Peden conducted the marriage of John Brown at Priesthill in Muirkirk parish in 1682 In order to protect the Presbyterian polity and Calvinist doctrine of the Church of Scotland, the pre- Restoration government of Scotland signed the 1650 Treaty of Breda with King Charles II to crown him king and support him against the English Parliamentary forces. At his Restoration in 1660, the King renounced the terms of the Treaty and his Oath of Covenant, which the Scottish Covenanters saw as a betrayal. The Rescissory Act 1661 repealed all laws made since 1633, effectively ejecting 400 Ministers from their livings, restoring patronage in the appointment of ministers to congregations and allowing the king to proclaim the restoration of bishops to the Church of Scotland. The Abjuration Act of 1662 ..was a formal rejection of the National Covenant of 1638 and the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643. These were declared to be against the fundamental laws of the kingdom. The Act required all persons taking public office to take the Oath of Abjuration not to take arms against the king, and rejecting the Covenants. This excluded most Presbyterians from holding official positions of trust. http://www.thereformation.info/abjurationOath.htm The resulting disappointment with Charles II's religious policy became civil unrest and erupted in violence during the early summer of 1679 with the assassination of Archbishop Sharp, Drumclog and the Battle of Bothwell Bridge. The Sanquhar Declaration of 1680 effectively declared the people could not accept the authority of a king who would not recognise their religion, nor commit to his previous oaths. In February 1685 the king died and was succeeded by his Roman Catholic brother, the Duke of York, as King James VII. Life John Brown lived in a remote farm called Priesthill, in the upland parish of Muirkirk in Kyle, Ayrshire, where he cultivated a small piece of ground and acted as a carrier. WodrowThe history of the sufferings of the Church of Scotland from the restoration to the revolution, 1721 describes him as 'of shining piety', and one who had 'great measures of solid digested knowledge, and had a singular talent of a most plain and affecting way of communicating his knowledge to others, he had employed his leisure in instructing youths.' Wodrow, vol.iv He had fought with the Covenanters at the battle of Bothwell Bridge (1679), and was on intimate terms with the leaders of the persecuted party. In 1682, Alexander Peden, one of the chief of these, married him to his second wife, Marion Weir. On this occasion Peden, according to Walker,Patrick Walker, Six Saints of the Covenant, 1727 foretold the husband's early and violent end: 'Keep linen by you for his winding-sheet'. He was shot on the morning of 1 May 1685, in a summary execution instigated by John Graham of Claverhouse under the emergency powers given him by the Privy Council23 April 1685, Hist. MSS Comm. Reept. XV, Ptf viii, pp91-98 to suppress insurrection in the South West of the country. Death Battle of Drumclog Memorial inscription In 1685, Brown was captured (along with his nephew, one 'John Brownen') by a troop of horse under the command of Graham of Claverhouse. Brown's house was searched where 'bullets, match and treasonable documents' were found.Mark Napier - Memorials and letters illustrative of life and times of John Graham of Claverhouse, viscount Dundee (1859) Brown was offered the chance to take the Oath of Abjuration. Brown refused to swear the oath which was designed to be repugnant to Covenanters and thereby a \\"sieve, the mesh of which would winnow the loyal from the disloyal\\".Charles Sandford Terry - \\"John Graham of Claverhouse, viscount of Dundee, 1648-1689\\" (1905) p 194 At the time, failure to take the Oath was a capital offence and thus defying the King was high treason; this was a fact of which Brown was well aware. 'John Brownen' then made testimony that John Brown had in fact been 'in armes' at Drumclog and Bothwell Bridge. An underground house was discovered which contained weapons which Brown stated belonged to his uncle - John Brown.Charles Sandford Terry - \\"John Graham of Claverhouse, viscount of Dundee, 1648-1689\\" (1905) Controversy Much of what we know of his life has come from contemporary accounts of the dramatic events of the morning on which he died. A number of clearly polemical accounts were produced in the years following while eyewitnesses remained living and their accounts could be assembled.Wodrow's History of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland. Edin. 1721-2; Patrick Walker's Life of Peden, (published within \\"Six Saints of the Covenant\\". 1727, Glasgow; Thomson's edition of A Cloud of Witnesses (1713), Edin. 1871, gives (pp. 574-5) an account of the monument, with copy of inscription; Daniel Defoe's 1717 book \\"Memoirs of the Church of Scotland can also be included in this group as an exercise in polemic; as can John Howie (biographer)'s scholarly \\"Scots Worthies\\" (1775) which, while written 100 years later, mentions in passing the story of Alexander Peden's portentous prophecy at John Brown's marriage p511 These (except Howie) were written after the Revolution but while the Jacobite threat was still alive. It is these accounts which have been influential in setting a reputation of cruelty on the part of Claverhouse. A second level of detail was published in the late 19th century by revisionists chiefly concerned with reassessing and redefining Claverhouse's reputation.Napier's Life and Times of John Graham, Edin. 1862, contains Claverhouse's Report, together with a defence of his conduct; Charles Sandford Terry - \\"John Graham of Claverhouse, viscount of Dundee, 1648-1689\\" (1905) Mark Napier's work is an overt paean on the life of his hero Claverhouse, while Charles Sandford Terry takes a more modern approach to the source documents, but expresses his views nevertheless. These both publish a letter from ClaverhouseHist. MSS Comm. Rept XV, Ptf. viii, p299, dated 3 May 1985, from Glaston, Ayshire to the Duke of Queensberry, the Lord High Treasurer, the head of the Scottish government, in which Claverhouse defends his actions taken in executing John Brown. Not surprisingly, he is sparse on detail of the summary execution. 'I caused shoot him dead, which he suffered very inconcernedly.' This contrasts with his great detail on the reasons and evidence against Brown. Napier and Terry cite this letter as an example of Claverhouse's professionalism in law enforcement, simply following orders. However, Wodrow et al. do not dispute Brown was technically guilty of the draconian laws, but question the morality of the high-handed laws and highlight the cruelty of Claverhouse in carrying out the sentence on the spot, in front of his house, infant son and pregnant wife. A memorial was erected after his death and a more permanent stone plinth put in place in 1828. The site, on the remote hillside above Muirkirk is still the destination of visitors to pay their respects and sits on an ancient upland path that runs to Lesmahagow. Shooting the death of John Brown of Priesthill from Scots Worthies Several stories were published by Covenanting commentators after his death, each with slightly different detail. Patrick Walker describes six troopers who shot Brown, and that \\"the most part of the bullets fell upon his head\\", Wodrow says that the dragoons were so moved to tears after Brown prayed that they refused to obey Claverhouse's orders and that he himself had to shoot - for fear of mutiny - adds Howie. While Alexander Shields writing only five years laterAlexander Shields, A short Memorial of the sufferings of the Presbyterians in Scotland, 1690 mentions that Brown was shot in front of his house in the presence of his wife, Wodrow says his wife was pregnant and that his infant son was also present. Walker makes no mention of his wife being pregnant but that his son and a child from a previous marriage were present. While critics of the Covenanters point to the inconsistency of the detail as proof of their fabrication, the sheer number of similar cases painstakingly recorded by these authors within living memory of the events and the wide popularity and readership of these publications confirms, at least, the deep effect these events had on a nation who, for a hundred years had subscribed to a settled religion that was now under threat by the stroke of the King's legislating pen. Significance Controversy over the details notwithstanding, the sheer number of events like this and their continued power to excite controversy shows a broader significance beyond the immediate religious arguments. As part of the political ferment leading to the Revolution in both Scotland and England, they represent the emergence of the people's voice against government policy and the development of modern ideas of democracy and the limits of government in the face of popular opposition. These views eventually supplanted the Stuart dynasty's view of the Divine right of kings. Bibliography *Wodrow's History of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland.

response to secure the northern and southern land borders of the United States. It was a part of Secure Border Initiative (SBI), an overarching program of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to organize the four operating components of border security: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the United States Coast Guard. DHS announced the program's cancellation on Jan. 14, 2011.David Perera, \\"DHS cancels SBinet\\", FierceGovernmentIT, Jan. 14, 2011 In August 2008, DHS ordered Boeing to stop SBI work along the border between Arizona and Mexico because CBP had not received the necessary permissions from the Department of the Interior.Alice Lipowicz, \\"DHS orders work to stop on SBInet\\", Federal Computer Weekly, August 19, 2008 Boeing told a subcontractor that the suspension of work could last until January 1, 2009.\\"Work halts on border 'virtual fences'\\", Arizona Daily Star, August 23, 2008 On March 16, 2010, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced the DHS was diverting $50 million for the project into other efforts and that all work beyond the current pilot projects have been frozen.\\"Work to cease on 'virtual fence' along U.S.-Mexico border\\", Washington Post, March 16, 2010  Background  SBInet (a component of SBI) was a program created under U.S. Customs and Border Protection to design a new integrated system of personnel, infrastructure, technology, and rapid response to secure the northern and southern land borders of the U.S. SBInet replaced two former programs, America's Shield Initiative and the Integrated Surveillance Intelligence System. Both of these programs had similar goals, but were scrapped due to mismanagement and failure of equipment. To avoid such problems, DHS decided to have development of SBInet managed by a single private contractor.

(Security Personnel)  History of the program On September 21, 2006 DHS announced the award of the SBInet contract to Boeing.DHS: DHS Announces SBInet Contract Award to Boeing DHS deputy director of homeland security Michael Jackson played a large role in the initiation of SBInet, while Greggory L. Giddens served as executive director of the SBI Program Management Office at CBP. Kirk Evans was the first SBInet program manager; on April 11, 2008, he resigned to accept another position within DHS.SBInet program manager steps down Five companies competed for the SBInet contract: Boeing, Ericsson, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon. On September 21, 2006, following an intensive and detailed source selection process, DHS announced that it had chosen to award the contract to Boeing. Boeing named Jerry McElwee as SBInet's executive program manager, Tony Swansson as the deputy program manager, and Ilia Rosenberg as the director of technology assessment. In August 2007, McElwee was replaced by a new program manager, Daniel Korte.Alice Lipowicz, \\"Boeing names Korte SBInet program manager\\", Washington Technology, August 23, 2007 Boeing planned to have Project 28, the first phase of SBInet, operational in June 2007, but ran into software and other technology problems. In early September 2007, with the Project 28 implementation delayed until at least October, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said at a Congressional hearing, \\"I am not going to buy something with U.S. government money unless I'm satisfied it works in the real world.\\" He added, \\"And if it can't be made to work, I'm prepared to go and find something that will be made to work, although I'll obviously be disappointed.\\"Chris Strohm, \\"Contractor problems hold up border fence project\\", Government Executive magazine, September 7, 2007 Border patrol agents began using the system in December 2007, and the system was officially accepted by DHS in February 2008. Boeing was awarded further contracts to upgrade software and hardware, which it expected to have done by the end of 2008.Boeing to replace 9 towers at border  www.azstarnet.com In February 2008, a Government Accountability Office report detailed problems with the then-deployed technologies. The system was designed to detect a \\"target\\" with radar, and then use video cameras to determine whether the radar return came from a person or vehicle, or from some benign source (such as an animal). The GAO reported that radar information was too slow to appear on screens, and was being inappropriately triggered by rain and other weather phenomena. Camera resolution was insufficient for targets beyond 3.1 miles, and the stylus- controlled laptops mounted on moving vehicles were not rugged enough and were difficult to use. These findings were against the prototype system known as \\"Project 28\\". They were all addressed before the final production system was ready in 2010.  The contract  SBInet was controlled by an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract extending through September 30, 2009, with three one-year option periods. The only commitment that DHS was to pay Project 28, a 28-mile pilot section of SBInet in the Tucson sector of the Arizona-Mexico border. The cost of this pilot section was estimated at $67 million. The value of Boeing's three-year contract to build SBInet across both the northern and southern borders was estimated by various sources at various times to be between $2 billion and $8 billion. The contract included what DHS called \\"off-ramps\\" - milestones where DHS could discontinue the project if it found Boeing's work unacceptable. The contract allowed DHS to acquire certain solutions from a vendor besides Boeing.Robert Brodsky, Zack Phillips and Katherine McIntire Peters, \\"Big Contracts, Big Problems\\", Government Executive magazine, August 15, 2007 The U.S. Army was to conduct an independent assessment of SBInet's interim operating capabilities at the end of the project's first initiative.  Objectives  The goal of SBInet was to secure the border by fulfilling these main objectives: # deter potential illegal border crossers from making the attempt # predict illegal border activities before they occur # detect entries when they occur # identify what the entry is # classify the threat level of the entry before interdiction # track the movements of illegal entrants # provide a means to effectively and efficiently respond to entries # bring interdictions to an appropriate resolution (e.g., identity checks, judicial and administrative actions, deportations, and so forth) In addition, SBInet sought to provide a \\"common operating picture\\" of the border environment that could be shared with DHS components and federal, state, and local partners to provide comprehensive situational awareness, improving interoperability. The SBInet contract gave Boeing full responsibility for developing, deploying, and maintaining a system that was able to accomplish these goals.  Requirements  Boeing was required to design, develop, test, integrate, deploy, document and maintain the optimum mix of personnel, technology, infrastructure, and response capability to defend 6,000 miles of border. Boeing was required to manage every aspect of the implementation of SBInet; its job even included less intuitive tasks, such as recommending new paradigms for the way Border Patrol Agents operated, training maintenance personnel to repair their products, and guiding construction of facilities to house additional CBP offices required for SBInet. Additionally, Boeing was required to integrate the program into previously existing infrastructure and equipment systems wherever possible. The pilot section of SBInet was required to be completed and fully operational eight months from the contract signing. , Boeing had missed its June 13 deadline for delivery of the pilot section.  Oversight  The SBInet Program Management Office (PMO), led by the SBInet Program Manager, was responsible for conducting oversight activities such as testing the system's performance in improving the security of the border, examining Boeing's designs to predict and prevent deficiencies, and monitoring the financial efficiency of the project. The PMO included more than two hundred subject matter experts in engineering, program management, budget control, Border Patrol operations, port of entry operations, environmental management, logistics, risk management, and more. Additionally, the PMO engaged the U.S. Army's test and evaluation experts to provide independent evaluation services, to include operational assessments and large-scale operational testing. The PMO was criticized for inadequate staffing, which impeded its effectiveness in the early months of the program. As a result, the PMO rapidly expanded the size and quality of its staff, enabling it to intensify oversight operations.  Technology =Tower system Towers were meant to be set up along the border, with varying surveillance and communications equipment depending on the climate, terrain, population density, and other factors. Towers were slated to include radar, long-range cameras, broadband wireless access points, thermal imaging capabilities, and motion detectors. SBInet was meant to also include some ground sensors for seismic detection as well. Command centers All of the information received by sensors were meant to go to command centers, where a \\"common operating picture\\" would have been compiled by CBP and shared with other agencies. The common operating picture would have appeared on computer screens as a geospatial map, where border entries are tracked in real time. Command center personnel were supposed to be able to click on a given entry, view the entry, and assess the threat using the long- range cameras on the towers. They will then dispatch Border Patrol agents accordingly. Border Patrol response Border Patrol agents were meant to carry PDAs with GPS capabilities, to allow the command center to track the location of agents interdicting illegal entries and watch the encounter in real time on the common operating picture. Additionally, the PDAs were supposed to have advanced fingerprint identification technology, to allow Border Patrol agents to identify an individual at the interdiction site immediately and the ability to view and control tower cameras from the PDA. In addition, Border Patrol agents were to be given laptops in the patrol car to provide the information necessary to effectively and safely approach a given threat. Airborne sensors Airborne sensors on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were meant to fill in gaps in the \\"virtual fence\\" in remote areas where building and maintaining towers was impractical. A small UAV called the Skylark operated by a single individual, was considered. The Skylark was made by Elbit Systems. Construction strategy The towers that were initially to be placed in the pilot section were intended to be mobile, so that they could be moved around to discover optimal placement. Once the optimal placement was determined, they would be replaced with permanent towers, and the mobile towers were to be reused to begin construction on the next section of SBInet in a similar manner. At completion, Boeing estimated that it would use approximately 1,800 towers to create its \\"virtual fence\\" along the borders. In addition to towers and technology systems, SBInet would include the construction of fences, vehicle barriers and border roads. Criticism The SBInet program was criticized by media and political sources. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairman Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.), Ranking Member Susan Collins (R-Me.), Senator Daniel Akaka (D-HI.), and Senator George Voinovich (R-Oh.), expressed concern that the program faced significant management challenges that could undermine its effectiveness. In anticipation of the department's final approval of Project 28 and the planned investment of at least $64 million for the next phase of SBInet's development, the senators sent a letter to DHS secretary Michael Chertoff, questioning CBP's failure to establish firm operational requirements before initiating Project 28, and asking whether such requirements would be addressed in the next phase. The senators also cited an over-reliance on contractors as one of their chief concerns, raising issues about whether DHS could properly oversee the project. Jerry McElwee, a Boeing vice president, said that the June 2007 version of Project 28 was \\"a demonstration of our approach and a test bed for incorporating improvements\\" to SBInet. Under heavy scrutiny for costs and effectiveness, Boeing reiterated that P28 was a test program. In June, 2010 a General Accounting Office report summarized severe criticism of the project stated at a congressional committee hearing.\\"SECURE BORDER INITIATIVE - DHS Needs to Follow Through on Plans to Reassess and Better Manage Key Technology Program\\", Statement of Randolph C. Hite, Director Information Technology Architecture and System Issues, released June 17, 2010 Janice Kephart of the Center for Immigration Studies defended SBINet, writing, \\"SBInet is still operational where it was deployed, despite the widespread notion that the light switch was turned off on both the Tucson and Ajo sectors due to cancellation. The reason SBInet is still operating is because it works.\\"Secure Border Initiative Proves Itself Again  Cancellation  Once DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano ordered an assessment of the project in January 2010, the future of the project was uncertain and in March 2010 DHS froze additional funding for anything beyond already begun initial deployments. On Jan. 14, 2011, DHS said it would redirect funding originally intended for SBInet‚Äîincluding fiscal 2011 SBInet funds‚Äîto a new border security technology effort. \\"SBInet cannot meet its original objective of providing a single, integrated border security technology solution,\\" Napolitano said in a prepared statement. ‚ÄúDHS briefed Congress today on my decision to end SBInet as originally conceived and on a new path forward for security technology along the Southwest border. ‚ÄúThe new border security technology plan will utilize existing, proven technology tailored to the distinct terrain and population density of each border region, including commercially available mobile surveillance systems, unmanned aircraft systems, thermal imaging devices, and tower-based remote video surveillance systems. Where appropriate, this plan will also incorporate already existing elements of the former SBInet program that have proven successful, such as stationary radar and infrared and optical sensor towers,‚Äù the statement said. The cancellation was welcomed by some members of Congress. Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, also issued a statement describing SBInet as a ‚Äúgrave and expensive disappointment‚Äù that cost taxpayers nearly $1 billion for only 53 miles of coverage. ‚ÄúI am glad that DHS and Customs and Border Protection are finally listening to what we have been saying for years ‚Äì that the sheer size and variations of our borders show us a one-stop solution has never been best,‚Äù Thompson wrote. ‚ÄúI applaud them for taking this critical step toward using a more tailored technologically based approach to securing our nation‚Äôs borders.‚Äù Sen. Joseph Lieberman (I-Conn.) who chaired the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, also supported Napolitano‚Äôs decision. ‚ÄúThe Secretary‚Äôs decision to terminate SBInet ends a long-troubled program that spent far too much of the taxpayers‚Äô money for the results it delivered,‚Äù Lieberman said. ‚ÄúThe department‚Äôs decision to use technology based on the particular security needs of each segment of the border is a far wiser approach, and I hope it will be more cost effective.‚Äù Boeing's SBInet contract gets the axe\\"  References  External links  * , U.S. Customs and Border Protection *\\"SBInet Expenditure Plan Needs to Better Support Oversight and Accountability\\" (pdf), U.S. Government Accountability Office, February 2007 *http://hsgac.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressReleases.Detail&Affiliation;=C&PressRelease;_id=e3910540-0678-4f9d-9143-86513c10ff5c&Month;=1&Year;=2008 Category:United States Department of Homeland Security ","title":"SBInet"},{"id":"10166370","text":"Mistassini is a geographic name which may refer to several geographic features in the Canadian province of Quebec: * a part of the city of Dolbeau- Mistassini, * Mistassini River, * Mistassini Lake, * the First Nations reserve of Mistissini, * Zec des Rivi√®res-Godbout-et-Mistassini ","title":"Mistassini"},{"id":"10166384","text":"WGAD (930 AM) is a radio station licensed to serve Rainbow City, Alabama, United States. It operates at 930 kilohertz, with a daytime power of 5,000 watts non-directional, and 500 watts directional at night. Established in 1951, the station is currently owned by Jeff Beck and the broadcast license is held by Gadsden Radio Media, LLC. Programming WGAD broadcasts an oldies format to the greater Gadsden, Alabama, area. Weekend programming features special shows from Scott Shannon, Dick Bartley, and Gadsdens' own Bob Mayben. July 2007 when the station changed formats, they launched a live and local morning show. The show maintained the same host but changed co-hosts several times before the show was taken off the air in November 2008. History The 930 frequency came to Gadsden when local druggist \\"Doc\\" Cary Graham put WETO on the air in 1950. WETO operated with 1,000 watts daytime only. In 1963 Gadsden radio veteran Charlie \\"B\\" Boman bought the station from Mr. Graham, and began a series of upgrades, both to the station and its image. From its original location in the rear of \\"Doc's\\" drug store, Boman moved to the Life of Alabama Insurance building on the main street of town, and installed all new equipment. Boman had begun his radio career at the original WJBY, and found those call letters to be available, so the heritage call returned to the air at the 930 spot on the dial, late in 1963. Boman also raised the power to 5,000 watts, while still a daytime station. In the early to middle seventies, the station enjoyed popularity as a contemporary music station under Program Director Bob Mayben, who patterned the presentation after pop stations in large markets. In the late 1970s Boman sold WJBY to Hinton Mitchem and Gordon Henderson, who added the night time signal and erected four new towers. In 2011, the station was sold to Jeff Beck. Frequency swap On October 4, 2007, the WJBY call sign was moved from 930 AM to 1350 AM while sister station WGAD in Gadsden had its call sign moved from 1350 AM to 930 AM. In October 2010, the stations began the process to regain their original (prior to 2007) call letters. The station on 930 AM went dark on October 10, 2010, and regained the \\"WJBY\\" call sign on January 19, 2011. WJBY resumed normal broadcast operations on September 12, 2011. On September 20, 2012, the station changed its call sign back to WGAD. On August 30, 2013 WGAD changed their format to adult hits, and in 2015 moved to a broad oldies format.

Vichara is also called jnana-vichara or ' by his devotees. ƒÄtman (IAST: ƒÅtman, Sanskrit: ‡§Ü‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç) is a Sanskrit word that is usually translated as \\"self\\". The root *ƒìt-men (breath) is cognate with Old English \\"√¶√æm\\", Greek \\"asthma\\", German \\"Atem\\": \\"atmen\\" (to breathe). It is derived from Latin \\"anima\\" (breath,soul), which is cognate to Sanskrit \\"√°nila·∏•\\" (wind). Although \\"√°nila·∏•\\" and \\"ƒÅtman\\" have similar meaning, they are not etymologically related. In Hindu philosophy, especially in the Vedanta school of Hinduism, ƒÄtman is the first principle, the true self of an individual beyond identification with phenomena, the essence of an individual. To attain salvation (liberation), a human being must acquire self-knowledge (atma jnana), which is to realise that one's true self (ƒÄtman) is identical with the transcendent self Brahman (or paramatman). Strictly speaking, \\"self- enquiry\\" is not the investigation of the \\"Self\\", \\"atman\\", but of the \\"I\\", \\"aham\\" (Sanskrit), \\"nan\\" (Tamil). Origins=Ramana Maharshi Ramana's teachings on Self-enquiry originated in his own awakening at age 16, when he became firmly aware of death. It made him aware of the Self. Ramana summarised his insight into \\"aham sphurana\\" (Self-awareness) to a visitor in 1945:David Godman (23 June 2008), More on Bhagavan's death experience At first, Ramana thought that he was possessed by a spirit, \\"which had taken up residence in his body\\".David godman (7 May 2008), Bhagavan's death experience, quoting from \\"the editor's introduction\\", The Mountain Path, 1981, pp. 67-69 This feeling remained for several weeks. Later in life, he called his death experience akrama mukti, \\"sudden liberation\\", as opposed to the krama mukti, \\"gradual liberation\\" as in the Vedanta path of jnana yoga: Hinduism According to David Frawley, \\"atma-vichara\\" is the most important practice in the Advaita Vedanta tradition, predating its popularisation by Ramana Maharshi.David Frawley, Self-Inquiry and Its Practice It is part of the eighth limb of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, which describes the various stages of samadhi. Meditation on \\"I-am-ness\\" is a subtle object of meditation in savikalpa samadhi. It is also described in the Yoga Vasistha, a syncretic work which may date from the 6th or 7th century CE, and shows influences from Yoga, Samkhya, Saiva Siddhanta and Mahayana Buddhism, especially Yogacara. Practice=Chasing the I Ramana taught that by paying close attention to the 'I'-thought, this 'I'-thought will disappear and only \\"I-I\\"David Godman (1991), 'I' and 'I-I' -- A Reader's Query, The Mountain Path, 1991, pp. 79-88\\\\. Part one or Self-awareness remains. This results in an \\"effortless awareness of being\\", and by staying with itDavid Godman (23 June 2008), More on Bhagavan's death experience this \\"I-I\\" gradually destroys the vasanas \\"which cause the 'I'-thought to rise,\\" and finally the 'I'-thought never rises again, which is Self-realization or liberation. Ramana gave upadesa, \\"instruction or guidance given to a disciple by his Guru\\",Arthur Osborne, Ramana Maharshi and the Path of Self-Knowledge. Glossary pointing to the true Self of the devotees and showing them the truth of it. As author and long-time devotee David Godman explains, Self-enquiry can be practised at all times: Self is awareness Ramana stated that the Self is awareness: Giving up awareness of not-self leads to pure awareness: Textual references Ramana's written works contain terse descriptions of self-enquiry. Verse thirty of Ulladu Narpadu: Verses nineteen and twenty of Upadesa Undiyar describe the same process in almost identical terms: Vichara Sangraham (Self- Enquiry): Transcription of Ramana's explanations Early on, Ramana attracted devotees who would sit in his company, and ask him questions. Several devotees recorded the answers to their own specific questions, or kept the sheets of paper on which Ramana answered, and had them later published. Other devotees recorded the talks between Ramana and devotees, a large amount of which have also been published. Ramana \\"never felt moved to formulate his teaching of his own accord, either verbally or in writing\\". The few writings he's credited with \\"came into being as answers to questions asked by his disciples or through their urging\\". Only a few hymns were written on his own initiative. Ramana's earliest teachings are documented in the book Nan Yar?(Who am I?), in which he elaborates on the \\"I\\" and Self-enquiry. The original book was first written in Tamil, and published by Sri Pillai. The essay version of the book (Sri Ramana Nutrirattu) prepared by Ramana is considered definitive, as unlike the original it had the benefit of his revision and review. \\"Nan Yar\\" was documented by his disciple M. Sivaprakasam Pillai, who was already heavily influenced by traditional Advaita, and so had added notes about the traditional Advaitic negation method for his own clarification; these additional notes were later removed by Ramana. A careful translation with notes is available in English as 'The Path of Sri Ramana, Part One' by Sri Sadhu Om, one of the direct disciples of Ramana.

A semi-structured interview is a method of research used most often in the social sciences. While a structured interview has a rigorous set of questions which does not allow one to divert, a semi-structured interview is open, allowing new ideas to be brought up during the interview as a result of what the interviewee says. The interviewer in a semi-structured interview generally has a framework of themes to be explored. Semi-structured interviews are widely used in qualitative research; for example in household research, such as couple interviews. A semi-structured interview involving, for example, two spouses can result in \\"the production of rich data, including observational data.\\"  Comparison to other types of interviews  An unstructured interview is the opposite of structured interview, because it tends to be more informal and free flowing and it is more like an everyday conversation. A structured interview is a type of interview that is completely planned, which means every interviewee gets the same interview questions. A semi-structured interview is the one in between. The questions are loosely structured and give interviewees more opportunities to fully express themselves. However, semi-structured interviews are less objective and legally harder to defend when compared with structured interviews. Semi-structured interviews somewhat restrict the interviewee's free flow of thoughts which limited the potential possibility of the interview as a whole. Because semi-structured interview is a combination of both structured interviewing and unstructured interviewing, it has both of their advantages. For interviewers, the constructed part of semi-structured interview gives them a general overview of the interviewees. It helps them draw an objective comparison from the interviewees, which is helpful for either qualitative research study or job interview. For interviewees, because the unstructured part of semi-structured interview gives them more space to ask for clarification on answers and to express free flow of thoughts, the interviewees normally feel less stress during the interview. They would present more communication skills to the interviewers and build personal bond with them under the relatively warm and friendly atmosphere.  Advantages and disadvantages = Advantages  Since a semi-structured interview is a combination of an unstructured interview and a structured interview, it has the advantages of both. The interviewees can express their opinions and ask questions to the interviewers during the interview, which encourages them to give more useful information, such as their opinions toward sensitive issues, to the qualitative research. And they could more easily give the reasons for their answers during the interviews. Plus, the structured part of semi- structured interviews gives the interviewers reliable, comparable qualitative data as well.  Disadvantages  Even though a semi-structured interview has several advantages, it needs time for the interviewers to prepare and do research before actually starting the interview. And in order to make the results reliable, interviewers need to meet an adequate number of people to conduct the interview. Since it allows people to freely express their thoughts, the interviewers need to carefully plan the questions to make sure they can get the answers they want, which also requires good communication and interviewing skills. Interviewers are responsible for the confidentiality of the interviews.  Interview guides  The specific topic or topics that the interviewer wants to explore during the interview are typically thought about well in advance‚Äîespecially during interviews for research projects. It is generally beneficial for interviewers to have an interview guide prepared. An interview guide is an informal grouping of topics and questions that the interviewer can ask in different ways for different participants. Interview guides help researchers to focus an interview on the topics at hand without constraining them to a particular format. This freedom can help interviewers to tailor their questions to the interview context/situation, and to the people, they are interviewing. There are several things for interviewers to pay attention to while preparing and conducting their interviews. When preparing for the semi-structured interview, the interviewers need to consider the characteristics of their questions. They should use open-ended questions but dichotomous questions which only lead to two opposite answers, and they should avoid asking multiple questions, leading questions or why questions. It is helpful for the interviewers that they have a scale for grading the answers prior to the interview. The drawback of the leading question is that it could subtly orient interviewers toward a certain way. And the downside of why questions is they can make the questions sound judgmental and might generate negative answers. During the interview, interviewers could try to restate and summarize the interviewees' answers to confirm their opinions. They could generate new questions based on interviewers' answers, but the questions should be around the particular qualities and experiences that they are looking for in interviewers. It is also helpful to take detailed notes or recording the whole interview to compare the answers afterward.  Ethical considerations  Because semi-structured interviews allow people to communicate and express their free flow of thoughts at some degrees, the interviewers need to pay attention to their intercultural competence and cultural dimensions during the communication. Intercultural competence requires people to recognize and respect the diversity of different cultural backgrounds. People with high intercultural competence often tend to respect individual variations and different cultural patterns. They often have self- assessments and are aware of the differences between people. They make their conclusions and assessments based on reliable evidence. People can improve their intercultural competence by regular self-assessments including the their values, beliefs and personal biases to improve their self-awareness. The interviewers need to understand that their personal beliefs and biases may slightly impact the way they address questions and, as a result, influence the outcomes of semi-structured interviews. Interviewers are also required to realize the cultural dimensions. Lack of the recognition of cultural dimensions could lead to miscommunication and unpleasant results during semi- structured interviews. Having high level of cultural dimensions can be reflected as, for example, respecting masculine, individualistic, uncertainty avoidance cultures.

Nature of the work A casino host will usually try their best to please patrons of their casino and will do their best to fulfill any reasonable requests their clients might have. The casino host has the power to issue complimentary services (or \\"comps\\") to players. Comps can range from complimentary meals, beverages, and show (concert or theater) tickets right up to full accommodation in a hotel casino. A casino host will develop a relationship with every level of gambler, from first-timers playing quarter slots to high-profile multimillion-dollar gamblers (a high roller). Comps issued by hosts vary greatly and can be anything from a free buffet coupon, overnight hotel accommodation and upgrade, or entertainment tickets, to luxurious villas and private charter flights to the casino. The level and issuance of these comps by the host is done using mathematical formulas that calculate a player's theoretical loss (also known as \\"ADT\\" for average daily theoretical, or \\"theo\\"), based on wager size, session length, and the house edge of the game. Based on this formula, the host will be authorized to re-invest a percentage of the house's theoretical win back into the player by issuing freebies with the aim of building a loyal relationship with the player. Position in a casino The casino host reports directly to the marketing managers in most casinos. The casino host is the member of management that has the most contact with players and patrons.

From September 2006 to January 2008, CBP, which runs SBInet, awarded $1.15 billion through eight task orders to Boeing for work on SBI and SBInet.Alice Lipowicz, \\"GAO: SBI so far nets Boeing more than $1B\\" , Washington Technology, June 30, 2008  References  Category:United States Department of Homeland Security ","title":"Secure Border Initiative"},{"id":"10166492","text":"Store Venjetinden (or sometimes Store Vengetinden) is a mountain in the municipality of Rauma in M√∏re og Romsdal county, Norway.

It was equivalent to 10 soles and was issued in the form of gold coins and banknotes, which circulated alongside coins denominated in centavos and soles. The gold libra was equal to the British sovereign. History The first libra coins were minted in 1898, to the same standard as the British sovereign (113 grains of pure gold). In 1901, Peru adopted a gold standard based on the libra worth 10 soles. The gold standard was maintained until 1932 (see Peruvian sol for more details). Coins were issued until 1930, banknotes until 1933. Coins Three denominations were minted. The 1 libra was for issued circulation between 1898 and 1930, the ¬Ω libra between 1902 and 1913, and the libra between 1905 and 1930. Banknotes Between 1914 and 1918, Cheques Circulares were issued redeemable by six banks for ¬Ω, 1, 5 and 10 libras. The Reserve Bank of Peru took over the production of paper money in 1922, introducing notes for the same denominations as the earlier cheques. In 1933, some of these notes, together with unissued notes dated 1926, were overstamped by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru with their values in soles.

Named for Ensign Herbert Hugo Menges (a naval aviator who was killed during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor), she was the first U.S. naval vessel to bear the name. History=World War II Menges was laid down by Consolidated Steel Corporation of Orange, Texas on 22 March 1943; launched 15 June 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Charles Menges, mother of the late Ensign Menges; and commissioned 26 October 1943 with Lieutenant Commander Frank M. McCabe, of the United States Coast Guard in command. After shakedown off Bermuda, Menges spent January 1944 on \\"schoolship\\" duty in the lower Chesapeake Bay. On 26 January she got underway from Norfolk for New York City, and on 31 January departed for Europe, on the first three-month-long deployment escorting convoys. On the night of 20 April her convoy, UGS 38, while off the coast of Algiers en route to the east coast of the U.S., was attacked by 30 German torpedo bombers. After shooting down one of the planes, Menges rescued 137 survivors of , which had been sunk by a torpedo, and two German aircrew. =Torpedo attack= On 3 May 1944, Menges was 15¬Ω miles astern of the convoy chasing down a radar contact when she was hit at 0118 hours by a G7es acoustic torpedo from (which was in turn sunk the next day by , and other warships). The explosion was so violent that the aft third of the ship was destroyed, killing 31 men and wounding 25. However, Commander McCabe refused to give the order to abandon ship as long as there was chance of saving her. In addition, several of the crew members heroically jumped astride torpedoes loosened in the blast to disarm them. Menges, thanks to such creditable action, remained afloat. Four hours later Menges was taken in tow by , and later on 3 May reached Bougie, Algeria to disembark her dead and wounded. On 23 June, the temporarily repaired Menges got underway from Oran, under tow by , bound for New York, and arrived 22 July. From 14 to 31 August the stern of , whose forward two thirds had been blown away by a torpedo in the Mediterranean Sea on 11 April, was welded to the remaining two thirds of Menges. The \\"new\\" ship came out of drydock at the Brooklyn Navy Yard for shakedown from 26 September to 20 October in Casco Bay, Maine. The severely damaged Menges under tow. =Convoy duty= On 15 November Menges steamed in convoy CU 47 from New York for Europe, arriving Plymouth, England on 26 November. She spent the next few months again on Atlantic convoy duty before joining , , and late in February 1945 to form the only hunter-killer group in the North Atlantic to be manned completely by Coast Guard personnel. On 18 March Menges assisted Lowe in sinking , their first target. She continued antisubmarine sweep and patrol operations until the German surrender on 7 May. =Coast guard service= On 30 May she escorted her last convoy to Europe, CU 73, arriving Cheshire, England on 8 June. Menges arrived back in New York on 21 June for duty as a training ship for the United States Coast Guard Academy, with two cadet cruises to the West Indies before arriving New London, Connecticut on 7 September. Three days later she departed for the Cape Cod area, arriving Boston, Massachusetts on 17 September. By Navy Day, 27 October, Menges was moored at Fall River, below Boston. Menges received two battle stars for her World War II service. Retirement The escort ship moved on to Green Cove Springs, Florida for assignment in March 1946 to the 16th (Inactive Reserve) Fleet. Menges decommissioned in January 1947 and entered the berthing area in the St. Johns River to spend the next 15 years there in reserve. By 1 January 1962 she was berthed at Orange, Texas in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, where she remained until stricken from the Naval Vessel Register 2 January 1971, the ship was sold for scrapping on 10 April 1972.

The regiment primarily served in the Army of the Potomac in the Eastern Theater and was heavily engaged in the first day of fighting at Gettysburg. History The regiment was organized in August 1862, with Robert P. Cummins as colonel, Alfred B. McCalmont as lieutenant colonel, and John Bradley as major. It was sent to Washington, D.C., where it built fortifications. After a couple of weeks, it was sent to Frederick, Maryland, where it performed garrison duties. In October, it became part of the 2nd Brigade of the Pennsylvania Reserves. At the Battle of Fredericksburg, the regiment formed part of the force which briefly pierced the Confederate right, losing 250 out of 550 men, including Major Bradley, who was mortally wounded. After the battle, the Reserves division was sent back to Washington, and the regiment was reassigned to the 1st Brigade, Third Division, I Corps. At the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, the unit fought first on McPherson's Ridge and then on Seminary Ridge before being driven back to Cemetery Hill only after being outflanked by Confederate North Carolina divisions on its left and right flanks. Only 140 men had made it back to Union lines, and Colonel Cummins was mortally wounded. During the next two days, the 142nd was only lightly engaged. After the battle, the regiment became part of the 3rd Brigade, Fourth Division, V Corps. In September 1864, Horatio N. Warren was promoted to colonel of the regiment. It fought throughout the Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg, mostly against the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad. After the surrender at Appomattox Court House, the regiment participated in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington and was mustered out on May 29, 1865. Casualties *Total enrollment: 935 *Killed and died of wounds: 7 officers and 133 enlisted men *Wounded: 21 officers and 409 enlisted men *Died of disease, etc.: 81 enlisted men *Captured and missing: 2 officers and 156 enlisted men *Total loss: 809. The casualty information presented above is as inscribed on the back of the 142nd's monument on the battlefield at Gettysburg National Military Park in Adams County, Pennsylvania.

History As the end of the Second World War approached the designers at Taylorcraft decided to develop a tourer version of the robust and reliable Taylorcraft Auster Model J AOP.V observation aircraft series. An Auster 5, registered G-AGOH, was modified to take a 100 hp (75 kW) Blackburn Cirrus II engine for trials. At the same time a prototype aircraft was built designated the Taylorcraft Auster V Series J/1 Autocrat. The long name was not used as the company changed name to Auster Aircraft Limited and the aircraft became known as the Auster J/1 Autocrat.Jackson 1973, p. 63.

One of the more spectacular feats of the type was the first visit of a civilian aircraft to an aircraft carrier, in the English Channel in October 1946. The last Rearsby built J/1s were delivered in 1952. The Autocrat became one of the most successful post- war British light aircraft with more than 400 built. A small number of variants were built and the aircraft became the basis for a family of light aircraft. The Autocrat was used by individual pilots, aero clubs and by small charter firms for passenger flights, banner towing and photography. Many J/1s were converted to J/1N Alpha standard with a higher fin and fitted with a 130 h.p. Gipsy Major engine, as used in the J/1B Aiglet. 45 new build J/1N Alphas were completed in 1956‚Äì57, mainly for export to Australia. A single Autocrat G-AGVI was converted by V.H. Bellamy in 1965 to be powered by a Rover TP gas turbine engine. It reverted to normal power in 1968. Starting in 1946, newly built examples of the Autocrat and Alpha were exported direct from the production line at Rearsby to many countries worldwide including Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Ceylon, Denmark, Egypt, France, Iraq, Jordan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, Sweden, Switzerland, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda and Uruguay.Jackson 1973, pp. 67‚Äì68.

He is delayed when the Chinese discover that the neutral Tibetan like Mandon \\"Province\\" contains a secret road from India to China crucial for the Allied war effort.

CastProduction The serial was based on the comic strip by Zack Moseley but it was not in the spirit of the strip as would normally be expected from a Universal production. Very little of the original comic strip was used and a new character, Tommy Thompson, was created by Universal. The similarity to Tommy Tomkins, of the Tailspin Tommy stories, may imply a crossover of sorts.

He currently plays guitar for Nashville, TN based, Lights of Marfa.  Biography  Born in Kenosha, WI and raised in Rockton, IL, Rizzo knew very early on that he wanted to play guitar. His parents had taken him to see Kiss in concert in 1979 and instantly he wanted to be Ace Frehley. He began taking lessons at Paradise Guitars in Beloit, WI at age 9, beginning with more formal training and competing in the Illinois Music League competitions in the early 80's. He placed second both years he entered (he jokes that there were only 2 competitors). Once he found rock music, his life was changed and he immersed himself in the guitar heavy music of the 80's rock bands (Van Halen, AC/DC, Scorpions, Tesla, Ratt, Whitesnake, etc.) Rizzo formed his first band, China White, with his elementary school classmates Chad Coonrod (drums) and John Pond (bass), along with a lead singer from a neighboring town, Jesse Foht. The band played their first club show before 3 of the 4 members could even drive. He relocated to Dallas, TX in 1997 with LeSonic. The band split up soon after the move and Rizzo was left bandless. In 1999 he joined Clumsy (featuring Marc Solomon formerly of Perfect and the Clowns). He spent 2 years touring with the band before they decided to call it quits and pursue other projects. Rizzo continued to write and demo songs with plans of relocating to Los Angeles, CA, but in June 2003 he received a call from his friend Casey Orr, who also happened to play bass for the Burden Brothers. He asked if Rizzo would be interested in auditioning for the open guitar player spot in the band. He accepted, auditioned and got the job. He was a member of the Burden Brothers from August 2003 to August 2007. While he was a member of the band they released two albums, Buried in Your Black Heart (2003) and Mercy (2006), on Kirtland Records as well as a live performance DVD entitled RYFOLAMF. Rizzo officially left the band on May 29, 2007. His departure was not announced until August 6, 2007, one day after his last show on August 5, 2007 in Madison, WI. In September 2008 Rizzo moved to Nashville, TN and from 2009 until 2013 was a member of the Nashville-based band, Adalene.

In the early 20th century, he was responsible for the murder of four children, the attempted murder of another seven children, and seven counts of arson. Early life Godino was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, one of eight boys. His father and mother, Fiore Godino and Lucia Ruffo, were alcoholics and abusive. Godino's father contracted syphilis before Godino was born, causing Godino to experience serious childhood health problems.  Early signs of social mismanagement  Starting in childhood, Godino killed cats and birds, and enjoyed playing with fire. His violent behavior and lack of interest in education caused him to move from school to school. When he was seven years old, Godino beat two-year- old Miguel de Paoli and threw him into a ditch. A nearby official saw this and led the children to the police station, where their mothers picked them up a few hours later. A year later, Godino beat Ana Neri, a child in his neighborhood, with a stone. A police officer intervened, but Godino was released from jail due to his young age. When he was 10, Godino's parents discovered his compulsive masturbation. Not knowing what to do with him, his mother told the police, resulting in a two-month jail term for him as masturbation was illegal at the time. Printed in Cole√ß√£o de Leis dea R√©publique do Brasil: Premeiro Fasciculo 10:2664, 2710 (1890).  Crime spree  On January 17, 1912, Godino set fire to a warehouse on Corrientes Street. When he was arrested, he told police, \\"I like to see firemen working. It's nice to see how they fall into the fire.\\" On January 26, 1912, Arturo Laurona, 13, was found dead in an abandoned house. A month and a half later, on March 7, 1912, Godino set fire to the dress of Reyna Vainicoff, 5, who did not recover and died some days later. In late September 1912, he set fire to a railway station, though the fire was extinguished without extensive damage. On November 8, 1912, he tried to choke 8-year-old Roberto Russo. He was arrested and charged with attempted murder, but was released until the trial. On November 16, 1912, he assaulted a three-year-old, Carmen Ghittoni, who suffered minor wounds before a police officer intervened and Godino ran off. On November 20, 1912, he kidnapped two-year-old Carolina Neolener, who cried out and was rescued by a neighbour. Later in the same month, he set fire to two large sheds, but the fires were quickly extinguished. On December 3, 1912, Godino saw 18-month-old Jesualdo Giordano playing outside his house and offered to buy the boy some sweets to convince him to go with him. Providing a few sweets then offering more, Godino took Giordano to a country house. When they were inside, he threw him to the floor and unsuccessfully tried to choke him with his belt. Then he cut his belt and tied his hands and legs. He started beating him and considered hammering his head. He left the house looking for a nail and saw Giordano's father, to whom he said he did not know where the child was. He then re-entered the house with the nail. He hammered it into the side of Giordano's skull and hid the corpse. The body was found by the father minutes later. At 8:00 PM, Godino went to the wake and touched the skull where he had fixed the nail. At 5:30 a.m. on December 4, 1912, he was arrested by police, confessing his crimes. Jail On January 4, 1913, he entered a reformatory, where he tried to kill some of the inmates. Because medical reports declared him insane, the judge discontinued the case and ordered him to stay in the reformatory. On November 12, 1915, an appeal was approved ordering him to be moved to jail on November 20. On March 28, 1923, Godino was transferred to Ushuaia Penitentiary. Throughout 1933 he spent some time in the hospital for a beating he suffered from inmates after he killed two of their pet cats. From 1935 onwards, he was always ill and received no visitors until he died on November 15, 1944 under suspicious circumstances.

It is one of eight public high schools in the Lake County School District, and is the second-largest high school in the district. Located in southern Lake County, the school serves Groveland, and parts of Clermont, Mascotte, and Minneola. South Lake High was founded in 1993 by consolidating Clermont High School and Groveland High School. As of 2017, enrollment consists of around 2,000 students. It has approximately 120 certified teachers and 6 administrators. Its colors are blue and silver. The athletic teams, called the Eagles, are represented by a bald eagle. Facility The school structure was originally completed in Fall 1993 to educate around 1,800 students. The main building is a two-story structure, housing administrative offices, guidance offices, and approximately 40 classrooms. An additional two-floor structure was completed in 2007 to house core academic courses. It was originally built to house freshmen courses, but has since been converted to house multiple grades. Due to multiple campus updates and the addition of portable classrooms as of Summer 2011 it has a capacity of around 2,400. The South Lake High campus has a library, a cafeteria, an auditorium, a band/chorus building, a gym containing a dance room, weight room, and a basketball/volleyball court, and three vocational buildings. One of these houses the culinary and JROTC program. This vocational building was converted from the original cafeteria. The campus also includes portables, six tennis courts, track, and football field and stadium. Student body South Lake High opened with approximately 1100 students, 700 from Clermont and 400 from Groveland. By 2009 the school had grown to around 2,200 students. At the inception of Lake Minneola High in Fall 2011 there was a reduction in the number of students to an expected 1,730. The school has since returned to around 2,000 students. Screaming Eagle bands The South Lake High School Band Program has been under the direction of Mr. Ryan F. Wright, since the summer of 2008. Since his time there, all facets of the program have consistently received Superior Ratings at Florida Bandmasters Association District and State Assessments. The program consists of The Screaming Eagle Regiment, Wind Symphony, Symphonic Band, Studio Jazz Ensemble, Jazz Lab Band, 4 Jazz Combos, 2 Percussion Ensembles, Woodwind Choir, Brass Choir, and the Cobalt Indoor Guard Ensemble. The program consists of around 130 students, who perform at festivals, competitions, community events, and concerts in the 700-seat SLHS Auditorium. The Screaming Eagle Band Program provides an opportunity for students to become lifelong learners through music and leadership instruction. The band program partners with Innovative Percussion, Inc. and Evans Drumheads. Since 2016, the school has founded The Music Institute at South Lake High School, offering an array of performance, technical, research, and leadership opportunities in the arts.

Roberts was born on the Eastern shore of Maryland, during a time of slavery. He was enslaved by Francis De Shields, a colonel in Washington's army. Roberts had fought beside De Shields in the American Revolutionary War, and once the seven-year war with Britain ended, worked for Washington in Philadelphia. Roberts went with De Shields as his servant. When De Shields died, Roberts expected to be set free, but instead was sold to William Ward. Roberts was torn away from his family and then sold at an auction in New Orleans to Calvin Smith. > It is not for me to foretell the end of oppression in this country, but one > thing is certain, virtue, sobriety, temperance, economy, education and > religion, will fit you for any emergency whatever, and are the best > qualifications for free men. That their attainment may be your constant > pursuit and most earnest endeavr, is the prayer of one now ready to depart. While he was enslaved by Calvin Smith he experienced traumatic events on the plantation. His cousin was whipped and put in the stocks only to die a week into being on that very homestead. Soon thereafter, General Jackson traveled to Calvin Smith's to enlist 500 slaves to prepare for the Battle of New Orleans. Roberts was one of these 500 men. When the army arrived in New Orleans, Jackson saw the fear in his men's eyes. To get their spirits up he said, > don't be discouraged, take a second look at them; they are but men like > yourselves. Courage will overcome your fears and dread. The triumph of Jackson's battle had cost Roberts a serious wound to his head as well as a missing forefinger. After the battle was over, the promise that Jackson had made to the enslaved men had evaporated into thin air. They marched to the Kentucky tavern to drink as much as the men pleased. > \\"Never,\\" said he, \\"suffer negroes to have arms; if you do, they will take > the country. Suffer them to have no kind of weapons over ten inches long. > Never allow them to have a piece of paper with any writing on it whatever. > You must examine your slaves very closely, for the time is coming when the > slave will get light; and if ever his mind is enlightened on the subject of > freedom, you cannot keep him.

If you > do, you will repent of it but once.\\" After the hearts of these men were broken, the only thing Roberts was allowed to do was go back to work for the master he had learned to despise only to return and observe additional abuse to him and others. In 1856, Roberts contacted President Pierce located in Washington City for an interview about receiving a pension for his merits in the war. Pierce said that Roberts was nothing more than a horse or a sheep and that it would be a disgrace to take a pension that his master was still receiving and give it to Roberts.

The aim of this group was to develop an indigenous theory which explains the dynamics of Caribbean economies and societies. Out of this effort came the plantation model of Caribbean economies and societies. The model separated Caribbean economies into the three following historical phases: # The pure plantation economy (1600 ‚Äì 1838) # The plantation economy modified (1839 ‚Äì 1938) # The plantation economy further modified (1939 - ....) The economy during the first phase was characterised by a slavery as the main mode of production and the plantation system as the main unit of production. The second phase saw the abolition of the slave system and the introduction of wage labour in an indentured form. The third phase was differentiated by the emergence a limited and restricted level of economic diversity as activities such as peasant agriculture, mining, and wholesale and retail trade started to compete with plantation agriculture.

At least 166 people were killed with a very large and intermediate-depth mainshock on March 3. Three weeks later, at least a further thousand were killed during a large, but shallow aftershock that had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong). The M7.4 and M6.1 reverse events were focused in the Hindu Kush mountain range area. Tectonic setting Northern Afghanistan lies within the broad zone of continuing collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. The area is seismically active, particularly as a result of faulting at just over 200 km depth within the descending slab. Many large events of M ‚â• 7 have been observed in the Hindu Kush, all with similar epicenters, with an approximate periodicity of about 10‚Äì15 years. These events have reverse fault focal mechanisms, which for the near-vertical slab indicates active extension. It has been proposed that these earthquakes are a result of \\"necking\\" of the downgoing slab, a process that may eventually lead to break-off. Smaller shallow focus earthquakes are also observed in the region, particularly associated with north‚Äìsouth trending zones of right lateral strike-slip, such as the Chaman Fault, with an increasing degree of shortening to the north, together accommodating the highly oblique convergence between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. Earthquakes The earthquake on March 3 had a magnitude of 7.4 , with a hypocentral depth of 225.6 km. The focal mechanism is consistent with reverse faulting within subducting oceanic crust. Comparison with similar earthquakes in 1993 and 2015, which have very similar depths and epicenters, suggests that the major component of the slip in all three events occurred on the same part of the fault. The earthquake on March 25 had a magnitude of 6.1 , with a hypocentral depth of 8.0 km. It had a reverse fault mechanism that occurred on one of two possible moderately-dipping north‚Äìsouth trending faults. Damage= March 3 event  At 12:08:19 UTC a 7.4 tremor hit an area S of Feyzabad, Afghanistan. At least 150 people were killed, several injured and 400 houses damaged or destroyed by a landslide that dammed and flooded Surkundara Valley, Samangan Province. At least 13 people were killed at Kabul and Rostaq and 3 people killed in Bajaur, Pakistan. At least 300 houses were destroyed in Badakhshan and Takhar Provinces. A 45 meter wide fissure opened in Xiker Reservoir in Xinjiang, China. This was a deep focus event and was felt in much of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Felt also in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and India.  March 25 event  At 14:56:33 UTC a 6.1 tremor hit an area SW of Feyzabad, Afghanistan. At least 1,000 people were killed, several hundred injured and several thousand homeless in Baghlan Province.

Brooks (November 22, 1920 - September 29, 2011) was an editorial cartoonist for The Birmingham News in Birmingham, Alabama, United States. He used his platform at The Birmingham News to criticize the Ku Klux Klan, despite the number powerful supporters in the region at that time. He won the Sigma Delta Chi Award for the most outstanding editorial cartoon of 1959 and served as president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists in 1969. Early life Brooks was born in Hopewell, near Andalusia in Covington County, Alabama. After high school he moved to Birmingham and studied at Birmingham-Southern College for two years, and then transferred to the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts where he was instructed by Vaughn Shoemaker (Chicago Daily News) and Don Ulsh. While in Chicago, Brooks met his future wife, Virginia. They had a daughter, Barbara, and son, Charles G. Brooks, Jr. In 1942 Brooks enlisted in the United States Army. After training he was enrolled in Officers Candidate School and was commissioned a second lieutenant and assigned to the 531st Engineer Shore Regiment. His unit participated in the D-Day landing at Utah Beach on June 6, 1944, mainly helping to establish a supply port at the beachhead. Later that winter the unit, recommissioned as the 3053rd Engineer Combat Battalion, which deployed from Li√®ge deep into Germany with the 9th Army and saw action in the Battle of the Bulge. During his army service Brooks drew several cartoons which appeared in Stars and Stripes. Professional life After his discharge in 1945 Brooks returned to his wife and new daughter in Chicago. He worked for Brach's Candy Company and as a bank guard before he found representation at the Fred Zaner Advertising Cartoon Syndicate. Hopeful that he could become an editorial cartoonist he wrote to friends in Birmingham and received mild interest from the Birmingham News. He took a gamble and made the trip to meet with News officials and was offered the position beginning in 1948. Brooks' cartoons were immediately popular in Birmingham. He used the platform to express great faith in the character of the American people and harsh criticism of anyone or anything that attacked or insulted that character. He did not withhold criticism of the Ku Klux Klan, a group which is believed to have counted many of the city's powerful men among its members. In addition to cartooning, the News lent Brooks out to work with police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to create sketches of suspects from eyewitness descriptions. Honors Brooks won the Sigma Delta Chi Award for the most outstanding editorial cartoon of 1959. His winning panel, entitled \\"Two Deadly Weapons\\" depicted a hand holding a revolver and a second hand holding an automobile in the same manner, labeled \\"reckless speeding driver.\\" Another cartoon on the same subject, which appeared during the holiday season, showed the Biblical Magi on camels following the Star of Bethlehem in the top panel and two colliding cars in the lower panel with the caption \\"Then...Bethlehem. Today...Mayhem.\\" The Texas Highway Patrol distributed copies of the cartoon instead of warnings in 1960 and partially credited Brooks with a drop in the number of fatalities during the Christmas season. Brooks' farewell to Walt Disney in 1966 showed dozens of Disney's cartoon characters gathered mournfully at his grave. Thousands of copies were requested from across the country and the original hands at Disney Studios. A 1975 cartoon lambasting Vice President Nelson Rockefeller for ignoring parliamentary procedure during debate of an anti-filibuster bill was passed around the Senate floor. A 1973 \\"The Wizard of Id\\" strip, drawn by Brooks' friend Brant Parker, shows an editorial cartoonist named \\"Charles\\" being punished by the King for lampooning him. Parker sent a personally inscribed copy to Brooks. A 1976 editorial in The Wall Street Journal referenced a Brooks cartoon entitled \\"All Things to All People\\" which showed presidential candidate Jimmy Carter standing at a church pulpit with a Bible in one hand and a copy of Playboy in the other. Brooks was invited to the White House in 1982 and presented an original of a cartoon making fun of Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill to President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office. Senator John Glenn's wife, Annie, requested the original of another cartoon showing Glenn rowing alone in the center of a river while a donkey leads Walter Mondale, Gary Hart, George McGovern and Jesse Jackson in a larger boat on \\"the left\\". Glenn wrote Brooks that it was the best gift his wife had given him and that it was the only cartoon he hung in his office. Former head of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, also requested a Brooks original cartoon, which he hung in his office. He served as president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists in 1969 and edited an annual volume of the Best Editorial Cartoons of the Year since 1972 for Pelican Books. He retired from the News in 1985. Since 1982 the University of Alabama at Birmingham's School of Community and Allied Health has presented a \\"Charles Brooks Award\\" annually to a graduating senior who made a creative contribution to the school.

The house and chapel are situated on the southern bank of the Parramatta River and are now enclosed by the Silverwater Correctional Centre. With Elizabeth Bay House and Camden Park, it is considered to be one of the three great houses of the County of Cumberland. Newington is a substantial and intact example of a rural colonial villa, and demonstrates the quality of life of prominent citizens and families from early settlements. It is associated with a notable New South Wales family, being built for John Blaxland, whose entrepreneurial business activities were among the oldest in the colony, and whose brother, Gregory Blaxland, assisted in activities generally relative to the site. Its use since the occupation of the Blaxland family has reflected a number of social changes as the founding site of Newington College, and as an asylum, hospital, and prison administration building. The estate The Newington estate was established on Aboriginal lands of the Wann-gal which encompassed the southern side of the Parramatta River from Cockle Bay to Rose Hill. In the first 40 years of European settlement, grants of land in this area, ranging from , were made to settlers. These land grants were inked in on County of Cumberland maps, with names of owners and land granted clearly indicated. In 1807, John Blaxland acquired of land, reserving the original grants of Waterhouse, Shortland, Archer and Haslam. He named the estate Newington after his family estate in Kent, England. Blaxland established a series of salt pans on the banks of the Parramatta River and by 1827 was producing 8 tons of salt each week for the Sydney market. Blaxland also established a tweed mill, lime kiln and flour mill. In 1843, Blaxland mortgaged the property to the Australian Trust Company. After he died in 1851 the Trust Company sold the property to John Dobie to recover the mortgage. The Blaxland family re-purchased the estate from Dobie in 1854 but offered it as security against a large loan. The property was transferred to the Official Assignee of the Insolvent Estate of Edward James Blaxland in 1860 and subsequently leased to the Methodist Church, who established Newington College on the estate. The College remained on the site until 1880. The property, extending from near the current Holker Street to the current Carnarvon Street, was sold to John Wetherill in 1877. The following year, John Wetherill registered a subdivision plan for the entire 520 hectare Newington Estate. This proposal comprised an extensive grid layout, of some 114 lots, which extended well into the mud flats and mangroves of Wentworth Bay and Homebush Bay. In 1906 and 1909, Wetherill further subdivided his property as Riverside Heights, with the first allotments sold in that year. It was hoped that the location of the subdivision in proximity to the developing State Abattoir and Brickworks would attract people to the area in association with the employment opportunities offered by these establishments. This venture was largely unsuccessful, with only a few lots being sold. However the layout of the western part of the Newington subdivision remains obvious in the current street pattern and street names.Sydney Olympic Park Authority - Five Layers of History Newington was first offered to the Government for use as an Asylum for the Insane in 1874. The Government did not accept this offer, however in 1879, Government Architect James Barnett prepared a report on the suitability of the Newington estate for a Reformatory School for Boys. His report concluded that the site was suitable for a Boys Reformatory or a Benevolent Asylum for Aged Women. In September 1897 the Crown Solicitor confirmed that 5000 pounds would be paid to John Wetherill to acquire about 19 hectares of land, which included Newington House. A new Aged Women's Asylum was constructed to replace the existing asylum which was housed within the Immigrant Depot at the Hyde Park Barracks. The first buildings were established in 1886 on this new site to house 300 patients. At this time, the hospital was categorised as a state asylum for dependent adults' with infirmity or illness of 'incurable character'. Various additional buildings and structures were added to the Newington Hospital over the years. In 1960 it was proposed that the hospital should be closed and the site sold to industry. The significance of the site, however, stimulated significant public opposition to the plans. In 1968, after a series of drawn out negotiations, the Government of the day decided to close the hospital and transfer the property to the then NSW Department of Prisons.Sydney Olympic Park - Colonial History at Homebush Bay The house Newington House is a two-storey Regency villa, built between 1829 and 1832, in the style of an English mansion, with disciplined English gardens. In its heyday the Blaxland Estate was famous for its landscaped gardens and orchards. The house today is located in the centre of the Silverwater Corrective Centre. The main front of the house is symmetrical, with a central pedimented break-front. The main entrance door is surmounted by a decorative fanlight. The design has been variously attributed to John Verge and Henry Cooper however no original drawings have been located. Newington House was one of the subjects of architect and writer William Hardy Wilson's romanticised drawings of colonial architecture in NSW published in the 1920s. The house is now used as an administration block of the Silverwater Corrective Centre. The house is unusual in architectural terms, for its character rather than its quality; externally it forms a typical Regency structure, its initial conception somewhat marred by the awkward later placement of the verandah, which however presents a fine portal to the house. Internally the main items of significance are the room layout and the rigorous but rustic character of its joinery, where aspirations to the manner and style of a Verge house are seen in primitive form, revealing more general standards of workmanship of the day, and thus the joinery is idiosyncratic in detail rather than of refined quality.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981 The chapel The Blaxland family chapel, named St Augustine's, was built in 1838 and a marble plaque, above the main door, attests to this fact. It is a rendered, single storey building of brick with corner buttresses and is rectangular in plan. In design it is Gothicised Georgian with pilasters, a string course and a pedimented gable. The pointed arch fenestration with simple tracery, coloured glass and quatrefoil vents are Gothic Revival in style. St Augustine's demonstrates the strong religious convictions of the Blaxland family. The garden Elements of the former house garden, and estate landscaping remain today. These include the outline of the formal carriage loop north of the house, isolated elements such as mature trees and an avenue of rainforest tree species and palms going north from the house towards the river. More detailed elements such as a pedestal and urn, east of the house on the edge of the former carriage loop also remain. Tree plantings lining the former carriage loop north of the house include Canary Island date palms (Phoenix canariensis), southern nettle trees (Celtis australis) and cotton palms (Washingtonia robusta) with their tall, clean trunks to 20m high. An avenue of trees towards the river comprises Bunya Bunya pines (Araucaria bidwillii), hoop pines (Araucaria cunninghamii), Moreton Bay figs (Ficus macrophylla), Canary Island date palms and swamp mahoganies (Eucalyptus robusta). The latter of these may be later plantings. Walkway planting dates to the 1860s-1900, the main period of popularisation and fashionability of these species, and their promotion by such public figures as then Directors of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, Charles Moore and Joseph Maiden. These men provided such species to many public institutions such as hospitals. Cotton and Canary Island date palms were also commonly promoted species in this period. Close to Holker Street and the main entry are large specimens of Hill's fig (Ficus hillii) and Moreton Bay figs, transplanted from estate remnants to the east of the current entry driveway as part of a redevelopment of the main entry. These trees are at least of 1880s vintage but possibly older. Significance trees throughout the site include the extremely rare Schotia afra (Kaffir bean, Boer bean) and the surviving turpentines (Syncarpia glomulifera) which are likely to be indigenous to the site.NSW Heritage Branch - Silverwater Prison Complex Conservation Area Newington College At the Methodist Conference of 1862, the Rev John Manton proposed that a collegiate institute, \\"decidedly Wesleyan in character\\", be founded in Sydney. It was expected that the school would \\"be open to the sons of parents of all religious denominations\\", and on Thursday 16 July 1863, the Wesleyan Collegiate Institute opened with 16 boys and a small number of theological students. As no suitable buildings were available in Sydney at the time, Newington House was leased. Newington College, as the school soon became known, prospered during its time on the Parramatta River and in 1869 was the first Australian school to play rugby football (against the University of Sydney),A Sense of Union - A History of the Sydney University Football Club (Syd, 1998) pp 22 and soon after was the first school in Australia to hold an athletics carnival. The Newington College Cadet Unit is the oldest corps in the Australian Army Cadets. Expanding student numbers meant that more extensive premises closer to the city were required. A bequest, by John Jones, of land at Stanmore, saw the College move to the newly fashionable inner-city suburbs in 1880. By resolution of the College Council, the name Newington College was perpetuated on the new site, and Newington has remained at Stanmore ever since. Newington, suburb Newington, New South Wales is a suburb built partially on the former Newington House estate. It is located on the western side of Homebush Bay, on the Parramatta River and north-west of Sydney Olympic Park and is best known as the location of the Athletes Village for the Sydney 2000 Olympics and 2000 Summer Paralympics. The Athlete's Village was converted to residential apartments after the Games. Other apartments and double-storey houses have also been built since. Newington Armory Newington Armory was a Royal Australian Navy (RAN) ammunitions depot built on the former estate of Newington House. A powder magazine and camp and were built in 1897 by the Royal Marines as an ammunition depot for admiralty ships. After the passing of the Naval Defence Act in 1910, by the Commonwealth that formally established the Commonwealth Naval Forces, the Commonwealth took over the ammunition depot and expanded the facilities. It became known as the Royal Australian Naval Armament Depot (RANAD). The RAN started to vacate the site in 1996, with ownership transferred to the Government of New South Wales to be developed as the Sydney 2000 Olympics Athlete's Village and the suburb of Newington.Sydney Olympic Park - Newington Armory  Gallery  NewingtonHouseChapel.jpgNewington House Chapel, undated drawing Stanmore Newington College 1.JPGNewington College, Stanmore Newington Athletes Village.JPGThe suburb of Newington  See also  * Silverwater Correctional Complex *Silverwater Prison Complex Conservation Area References Category:Farms in Australia Category:Gardens in Australia Category:Houses in Sydney Category:Defunct schools in Sydney Category:Victorian architecture in Sydney Category:1807 establishments in Australia Category:Residential buildings completed in 1832 Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:New South Wales places listed on the defunct Register of the National Estate ","title":"Newington House"},{"id":"10166943","text":"Photos of a multicellular cluster viewed from the side. A multicellular thunderstorm cluster is a thunderstorm that is composed of multiple cells, each being at a different stage in the life cycle of a thunderstorm. It appears as several anvils clustered together. A cell is an updraft/downdraft couplet. These different cells will dissipate as new cells form and continue the life of the multicellular thunderstorm cluster with each cell taking a turn as the dominant cell in the group.  Description  Typical multicellular thunderstorm hodograph. The formation of multicellular thunderstorms imply that the updraft in the mother thunderstorm is offset from its downdraft. New cells usually form in the upwind (usually western or southwestern) part of the storm where the downdraft of the mature cells meet the environmental wind, lifting the air parcel and triggering new convection. The mature cells are thus usually in the center of the storm, and dissipating cells are usually in the downwind (usually eastern or northeastern) part of the storm. Characteristics The multicellular cluster can last for hours while each individual cell should only last for about 20 to 60 minutes. These storms can sometimes be severe and sometimes have awkward paths due to the thunderstorm sometimes not following the path of the cells that compose it. The typical hodograph, plot of the wind versus altitude, associated with it shows a linear wind shear with altitude The moderate vertical wind shear leads to the development of a non-symmetric surface convergence associated with the thunderstorm outflow, with the strongest convergence taking place on the downwind side from the storm's motion. So while individual cells move along the windshear, the line moves at 30¬∞ of it, at 70% of the mean wind speed in the layer. The Convective available potential energy (CAPE) is moderate to large, usually between 800 and 1,500 J/kg. The radar structure of this type of thunderstorm is characterized by overhangs of reflectivity in the southwestern part of the cluster.  Threats  Any severe activity in one of these storms will most likely come from the dominant cell near or after its peak updraft strength. This is because there could be severe hail from a strong updraft that lasts only a short period of time, with damaging winds. Rain is an important impact of such systems. The speed and direction at which the entire cluster of thunderstorms move downstream make the difference in the amount of rain received in any one location. Individual cells might move downstream but additional cells forming upwind of the cluster can move directly over the path of the previous cell, forming training echoes. A multicellular storm can sometimes develop into a Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) or be a squall line. Updrafts reform new cells continually at the leading edge of system with rain and hail following behind. Individual thunderstorm updrafts and downdrafts along the line can become strong, producing large hail and strong outflow of straight-line winds ahead of system. Tornadoes are only occasionally reported. In certain conditions, squall line can extend on a very long line, moving extremely rapidly, and become a derecho.

As of May 2008, Coe is still a suspect in dozens of rapes, the number of which is unusually large; his convictions received an unusual amount of attention from appeals courts. Coe's mother Ruth was convicted for hiring a hitman against the judge and the prosecutor at her son's trial following his conviction. The bizarre relationship between Coe and his mother became the subject of a nonfiction book, Son: A Psychopath and his Victims, by the crime author Jack Olsen. On July 31, 1982, Coe legally changed his first name to Kevin. Arrest and trial During the wave of sexual assaults perpetrated in Spokane between 1978 and 1981, many involved an extreme level of physical injury to the victims.Rape victim tells her story: \\"He's always right there\\". Seattle Times, Sept. 3, 2006Woman who helped convict Kevin Coe steps forward. KXLY 920, no dateState is fighting to keep infamous rapist locked up. Seattle Times, Aug. 31, 2006 Due to a distinctive \\"signature,\\" a gloved fist or fingers rammed in the mouth and throat of his victims, police suspected the rapes to be the work of a single offender, whom the media soon dubbed the South Hill Rapist. In 1981, after a school custodian observed a car illegally parked in a bus drop-off zone during the time a daylight rape occurred, police traced the vehicle registration to Gordon Coe, the managing editor of the Spokane Chronicle. The senior Coe was in charge of a program to receive tips on the rapist's identity. Gordon was ruled out due to his age; his son, Fred also known as \\"Kevin\\" a former Las Vegas radio announcer and unsuccessful real estate agent, had the use of the car. Police placed a tracking device on Kevin Coe's car and discovered that, in addition to targeting lone female joggers, he was apparently stalking city buses for victims. After several victims identified him in photo lineups, Coe was arrested on six charges of first degree rape, although authorities believe he was actually responsible for numerous incidents of peepings, flashings, indecent assaults and at least 43 rapes.Spokesman-Review, 2007-12-27 A forensic psychologist has since testified in court to her professional assessment that Coe may be responsible for 53 sexual assaults. One of Coe's victims was former KREM-TV meteorologist and former KHQ-TV anchor Shelly Monahan,http://www.spokesmanreview.com/breaking/story.asp?ID=17256 but her case was not one of the six; she underwent hypnosis but was not able to identify her attacker. Coe was originally put on trial in 1981 and convicted on four of the six charges of rape. The case was a strong circumstantial one: in addition to positive identification given by the six victims, Coe had received speeding tickets in the same areas right after the rapes occurred; his blood type matched that left at the scene; and like the rapist, he was a secretor, meaning his blood type showed up in his bodily fluids. Coe's alibi was that he was either having breakfast or dining with his parents during the time the attacks occurred, or else, as his socialite mother Ruth testified, teaming up with her in a mother-and-son vigilante squad to follow local buses in order to try to capture the real rapist themselves. At sentencing, a psychiatrist hired by the defense testified that Coe had confessed to the sixth rape; this did nothing to reduce his consecutive sentences, which amounted to life plus 75 years. Coe would later recant this, claiming he had concocted the story thinking he'd be sentenced to a psychosexual treatment center instead of prison. In June 1984, three years after Coe's trial, Washington's Supreme Court tossed out all of his convictions because many of the victims had been hypnotized before formally identifying him, in the hope of providing more details to the rapist's identity. Coe was released on bail for a year before the new proceeding, where he was retried on the four counts for which he had been convicted, and was convicted again on three and sentenced to life plus 55 years. His appeal of the new convictions also made it all the way to the Washington Supreme Court, which in 1985 overturned two and upheld one (where his accuser clearly saw his face during the attack, so there had been no need to hypnotize her). Mother's arrest Three months after Coe was convicted, Ruth was arrested for trying to solicit the murder or maiming of her son's prosecutor and judge. She was convicted the next year and served several months in jail. Confinement history  Coe served the entire twenty-five years of his sentence at Walla Walla State Penitentiary. Maintaining his innocence, he did not attend any prison counseling programs. Coe became eligible for parole in 1992 but never applied.http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24922815/\\"Parole hearings? Oh, no, no, no, no. They won't let you go unless you admit guilt. I'm not going to admit guilt. I did nothing wrong. I have been appealing this case for 25 straight years. There was no point at which I was going to go the parole board and say, oh yeah, and let me out.\\" In 1990, Washington passed the Community Protection Act, a \\"civil commitment\\" statute that allows the state to indefinitely retain dangerous sexually violent predators even after their criminal sentences ended. If found guilty by a jury of possessing a \\"mental defect\\" that makes them likely to reoffend, offenders are sent to the Special Commitment Center on McNeil Island, where they receive treatment for mental disorders linked to sexual deviancy. Prosecutors attempted to apply this statute to Coe; on Dec. 22, 2007, a judge postponed the trial until his sentence was due for completion on September 2008.KXLY-TV While preparing for the hearing, a new search of the Spokane Police's evidence room turned up a box containing a rape kit slide with DNA, which was a match to Coe. However, the DNA evidence that matched Coe's was not for any of the other rape convictions that had been overturned, but for the rape for which he had just served time.http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/State-seeks-Coe-DNA-to- confirm-1980-rape-1224479.php Upon the completion of his prison sentence, Coe was transferred to McNeil Island to await the civil commit trial, which began on September 15, 2008.Seattle P-I, 29 Sept. 2008 On October 15, 2008, the prosecution and defense rested their case. The next day, after several hours of deliberation, the jury decided that the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that Coe was a violent sexual predator; he was committed to McNeil Island indefinitely. As of March 24, 2011, as reported in the Spokane Spokesman-Review, Coe's appeal of the trial proceeding to be civilly committed as a sexual predator was denied: > ... 23 victims identified Coe as their attacker in crimes that occurred > during the decade leading up to Coe's 1981 arrest. She [Psychologist Amy > Phenix] enumerated another 30 sex crimes in which the victims could not > identify their attacker, but said she believed Coe was the perpetrator > because of similarities to the other attacks.

Geography = Location  The municipality lies in Rhenish Hesse and belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Alzey-Land, whose seat is in Alzey.  Neighbouring municipalities  Nack's neighbours are Erbes- B√ºdesheim, Bechenheim, Nieder-Wiesen, Offenheim und Wendelsheim.  History = Religion  By religious affiliation, the greatest part of Nack's population, 44.8%, belongs to the Evangelical denomination, whereas 34.2% of the population is Catholic. Those professing another religious affiliation, or none, amount to 21%.  Population development  At 31 December 2004, there were precisely 631 registered inhabitants whose main residences were in Nack, and another 31 inhabitants with secondary residences in the municipality (according to data from the municipal statistics from the Verbandsgemeinde of Alzey-Land), making Nack rather one of the smaller villages in the Verbandsgemeinde, with its population of 24,362. Nevertheless, of the 24 places in the Verbandsgemeinde, 11 have even smaller populations than Nack. As the following table shows, over the last 30 years, there has been a rise in Nack's population of roughly 17%. { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"30%\\" - bgcolor=\\"#ff007f\\" align=\\"center\\"  Date  Inhabitants - align=\\"center\\"  31 Dec. 1975  541 - align=\\"center\\"  31 Dec. 1981  553 - align=\\"center\\"  31 Dec. 1985  506 - align=\\"center\\"  31 Dec. 1996  580 - align=\\"center\\"  31 Dec. 2001  629 - align=\\"center\\"  31 Dec. 2004  631 - align=\\"center\\"  31 Dec. 2005  628 } The climb in population figures over the last few years stems from the development of the new building areas, In den Drei√üig Morgen (1990) and Am Wingertsberg (1995). A further such area is foreseen: Procedures for transferring the land needed for the building area Am Sportplatz have been completed, and thereby the number of building lots on offer is to be raised by 15. The age distribution in Nack is much the same as it is throughout Germany. The younger age groups are represented in noticeably lower figures. The biggest group, among both men and women, is the 40-to-49 age group. This also holds true in age group breakdowns for the whole of the Verbandsgemeinde of Alzey-Land). In this municipality, 8 children each year until 2011 will begin school, which, given the figures for Nack, is no small number. The male share of the population at 51.03% is only marginally higher than the female share at 48.97%.  Politics = Town council  The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"400\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"  B√ºrgerverein  Wildner  Total - align=\\"center\\"  2009  8  4  12 seats }  Mayors  *Erhard Grauer (until 1997) *Paul Maruelli (until 2005) *Bernhard H√§hnel, B√ºrgerverein (since 2005)  Coat of arms  The municipality's arms might be described thus: Argent between two bars gules the letter N azure flanked by two cubes of the second, in chief five cubes in fess of the second, in base three cubes of the second.

The G&WRR; was chartered on April 23, 1864, under Chapter 323 of the Laws of 1864, by Mr. Archibald K. Meserole & Associates, as a general railroad. Capitalization was $100,000, and it had an unspecified authorized corporate life. The legislative grant awarded the following route: From Newtown Creek via Manhattan Avenue, Driggs Avenue, South 8 Street, Kent Avenue, North 4 Street, Driggs Avenue & return, now the northern end of the B43 (New York City bus) line. History To cement the charter route, a franchise was applied for, which was granted by the City of Brooklyn on February 29, 1864. Archibald Meserole was of a family of local luminaries in the Town of Bushwick, and is remembered today by Meserole Street in Williamsburg and Meserole Avenue in Greenpoint, both relatively minor routes on a citywide scale, but fairly important industrial and residential streets locally. The Kent Avenue portion of the route required trackage rights from the Brooklyn City Railroad, which was grudgingly given, but a snag appeared when the residents on North 4 Street denied permission for the new line. The City averted disaster by amending the franchise on December 16, 1867, substituting Grand Street between Kent and Driggs Avenues, along the route of the Grand Street and Newtown Railroad, again requiring a Trackage Rights contract. Operation Operation of the railroad started shortly thereafter, so the franchise became secure. In the meantime, Prospect Park became a focal point for the fledgling streetcar lines of Brooklyn City, as did the Village of Hunterspoint just across Newtown Creek in Queens County, and conflict erupted between this railroad and the Nassau Railroad over identical wording of the Nassau road's franchise and this road's franchise. Settlement resulted in the consolidation of this road and the Nassau Railroad as the Brooklyn City, Hunterspoint and Prospect Park Railroad on June 30, 1868.

Built in 1664 by Richard Jackson, it is the oldest wood-frame house in New Hampshire. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1968. It is now a historic house museum owned by Historic New England, and is open two Saturdays a month between June and October. History Richard Jackson was a woodworker, farmer, and mariner, and built the oldest portion of this house on his family's plot, located on an inlet off the Piscataqua River, north of Portsmouth's central business district. Jackson's house resembles English post-medieval prototypes, but is notably American in its extravagant use of wood. The house as first built consisted of a two-story structure with two rooms on each floor, flanking a massive central chimney. Not long afterward, a lean-to section was added to the rear (north side) of the house, which slopes nearly to the ground. Further single-story additions were made to the gable ends of the house, probably c. 1764. House in 2013 The founder of the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (SPNEA, now Historic New England), William Sumner Appleton, acquired the house for SPNEA in 1924 from a member of the seventh generation of Jacksons to live there. Appleton undertook a restoration of the property, removing 19th century modifications, and providing the building with leaded diamond-pane windows of a type that it would have had in the 17th century. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1968. and The George Rogers House, located just east of the Jackson house, is also a Historic New England property, but is not open to the public.

(2007) (family Lampyridae), especially well-known from Japan. They are often called \\"Japanese fireflies\\", but their members range farther into Asia and reach southern Europe (Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, among other countries) and Africa. This genus is traditionally held to extend to Australia, but these species do not seem to belong herein (see below for details). Biological description Unlike some other fireflies, the females of Luciola are fully winged. Ecologically, the genus is remarkable in that the larvae of several species are aquatic. The adults of the typical Luciola are similar to those of Atyphella which was formerly included in this genus. They can be easily distinguished by the males' aedeagus however, which in Luciola proper has large lateral lobes that do not taper and have elongated, slender and flattened smaller lobes along their ventral margin. The middle lobe of the males' aedagus is very slim and has a point before the tip. By contrast, the Australian group resembles Pyrophanes in its lateral lobes of the aedagus being small and not visible from beneath. But unlike in Pyrophanes, the sheath of the aedagus lacks paraprocts, and the seventh ventrite of the abdomen lacks the hairy lobes and points at its hind margin.Fu & Ballantyne (2008) Two Japanese species of Luciola, collectively known as hotaru (Ëõç), are significant in Japanese culture and folklore. They are symbols of the hitodama (‰∫∫È≠Ç or ‰∫∫Áéâ), the souls of the newly-dead. See also the explanations at the article on the movie Hotaru no Haka (\\"Grave of the Fireflies\\") for a discussion of the cultural significance of the hotaru.  Systematics  Luciola in the narrow sense appears to be most closely related to a rather basal group of Luciolinae, including Bourgeoisia and Lampyroidea and Hotaria. Their relationships are not well resolved and Hotaria is sometimes merged with Luciola. On the other hand, the genera Atyphella and Pygoluciola, which for some time were included in Luciola, is now again recognized as distinct.Ballantyne & Lambkin (2006), Fu & Ballantyne (2008) The internal systematics of Luciola are somewhat in need of revision, and it is not certain whether these species are all correctly assigned to this genus. For example, the Australian species appear to be separate and not very closely related to the other members of this genus, but rather to Colophotia, Pteroptyx and Pyrophanes. Whether the larvae of these can be recognized by the share soft terga lacking paranota, or whether this is a plesiomorphic trait also present in other Luciolinae, remains to be determined.Ballantyne & Menayah (2002), Ballantyne & Lambkin (2006) L. deplanata might be worthy of separation in a monotypic genus Photuroluciola. But considering the fact that many species remain essentially unstudied, a 2008 review of the genus concluded that: > \\"A phylogenetic analysis [...] may give indications for subdivisions within > Luciola. However, there are elements of the cart and the horse here - which > should come first? Break up Luciola based on narrow analyses, or wait until > more analyses are available? It is our contention that those Luciolinae > species which do not fit elsewhere should either be described as Luciola sp. > or remain undescribed until such time as phylogenetic analyses indicate a > repeatable pattern of subdivisions with Luciola.

Beginnings with Bodast  They first began working together in the band Bodast in 1968 which also featured Steve Howe (Yes, Asia, GTR) on guitar and Bobby Woodman Clarke on drums. They recorded one album produced by Keith West whom Howe had worked with in UK psychedelic band Tomorrow (known for their hit \\"My White Bicycle\\"), but it remained unreleased until it came out in truncated and remixed form in 1982 as The Lost Bodast Tapes. A full re-issue featuring the original 1969 mixes came out under the title Spectral Nether Street on the RPM label in the 1990s. Although not very active on the live circuit as they preferred to spend their time writing and rehearsing, Bodast played a show called the Pop Prom in 1968 where they were on the bill with The Who and acted as Chuck Berry's back-up band for the night.  As Curtiss Maldoon  Curtiss Maldoon were on Purple Records, the label started by Deep Purple. Their connection to Deep Purple came out of Dave Curtiss short-lived involvement with an early incarnation of the band known as \\"Roundabout\\" where Curtiss was the vocalist (and Bobby Woodman Clarke was the drummer). No recordings have come to light of this line-up. Dave Curtiss (under the name \\"Dave Curtis and the Tremors\\") recorded several beat singles in the mid 1960s for various labels. Their first LP featured Steve Howe on lead guitar, Tony Ashton, and musicians from Mighty Baby, including Roger Powell. This album features the song \\"Sepheryn,\\" which Madonna and William Orbit transformed into the hit song \\"Ray of Light.\\" Curtiss Maldoon did some touring after the release of this album bolstered by a rhythm section. They played shows with Badfinger in the US and also did a well reviewed concert at Lincoln Center where they were on the bill with vocalist Merry Clayton. Their second album came out under the name 'Maldoon' as Curtiss asked that his name be removed from the project, and that it be a Clive Maldoon solo album. It came out on the Purple label as well, this time distributed by Warner Brothers. After this album, Clive Maldoon continued trying to establish himself in the music world, but ran into a series of managerial and contract problems. He died in 1978 of complications from prescription medications.

Route description thumb Designated a National Scenic Byway by the America's Byway Program in 2005, the road travels within the Ouachita National Forest along the highest peaks of the Winding Stair Mountains, part of the Ouachita Mountain chain, including the second tallest peak in Arkansas, Rich Mountain, in elevation. Many of the forests along these ridges, stunted and of little commercial value, were never logged and are old growth. The two- lane road features hiking trails beginning at various points along its stretch and 22 scenic vista pull-outs. There are at least 13% hill grades along the route. History The current route opened in 1969 and formed a stretch of what would become Oklahoma State Highway 1. In this case, the number 1 was assigned due to the scenery along the highway. It was dedicated on June 7, 1970 by Lucy Baines Johnson-Nugent, the daughter of U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson. The roadway was designated as a National Forest Scenic Byway on February 8, 1989.

Postwar models derived from the Model J commenced with the J/1 Autocrat - note the use of J/1, not J-1.Hitchman, 1989, p. 53Ellison, 1966, p. 72 Auster J/5G Autocar at Sydney (Bankstown) Airport in 1970 The prototype Autocar G-AJYK, a model J/5B, first flew in August 1949 and was exhibited at the Farnborough Air Show in September.Jackson 1973 p. 75 A demand for a more powerful version for the tropics produced in 1950 the J/5E powered by a 155 hp (116 kW) Blackburn Cirrus Major engine. This was further developed as the J/5G which was first flown in 1951 and is also referred to as the Cirrus Autocar.Jackson 1973, p. 76 The later J/5P reverted to a more powerful de Havilland Gipsy Major engine. Other variants were built as one-off development aircraft, and some were converted in Australia with more mordern engines. Operations Saunders-Roe of Cowes, Isle of Wight, acquired a J/5G Autocar and fitted it with an experimental hydro-ski undercarriage and emergency under-wing floats. With this equipment, the aircraft could remain almost stationary on the water. The majority of the production Autocars were exported to sixteen countries and later resold in five further territories. The Autocar has been primarily operated by private pilot owners and by aero clubs but some were used by small charter firms in the UK and elsewhere as taxi and photographic aircraft.

The original manor house  The first mention of the Sausmarez family in Guernsey is at the consecration of the Vale church in 1117 attended by Guillaume de Sausmarez, followed by a letter dated 1254 in which Prince Edward, Lord of the Isles, afterwards King Edward I, ordered an enquiry into the rights of the Abbot and Monks of Mont-Saint-Michel to \\"wreck\\" in the Islands of Guernsey and Jersey. The enquiry was duly held before \\"Dominus Henry le Canelu, Dominus Gulielmus De Saumareis, milites\\". The William de Saumareis is almost certainly the same person as William de Salinells who was Seigneur de Samar√®s, then called Saumareys, in the parish of Saint Clement in Jersey, who was born towards the end of the reign of Richard Coeur de Lion. It is not known when he acquired his new fief in St Martin's parish in Guernsey, but its manor-house was on much the same site as the present one. In 1313 an inquisition of Edward II and again in 1331 Matthew de Sausmarez was Captain of the Castle at Jerbourg and the Seigneur of the Manor. The fief was mentioned in the Extente (land value assessment) of 1331 in the reign of Edward III of England as having belonged \\"from time immemorial\\" to the family of his grandson Matthew. The capture of the Island by the French in 1338 resulted in 1341, after a battle was lost in Les Hubits, St Martin, to Sir Peter de Sausmarez escaping via Petit Port to Jersey, returning after the Island was retaken in 1345. Of this oldest manor-house only a fragment remains. Its rough but remarkably solid stonework forms the basis of an outhouse on the north- east side of the main buildings and surrounds an arched doorway which was later blocked in with a different form of stone. This is one of the most ancient fragments of unrepaired Norman masonry in the island and can be fairly confidently dated to the mid 13th century.  The Tudor house  Both manor and fief remained in the possession of the family until 1557. In that year the Seigneur, George de Sausmarez, died without issue and left his estate to his sister Judith; sixteen years previously she had married an Englishman called John Andrews. who had come to Guernsey from Northamptonshire as Lieutenant to Sir Peter Mewtis, the Governor of the Islands. Their son John, who became known in Guernsey as John Andros, was in 1557, in accordance with Guernsey law, declared Seigneur in his mother's right. His rights to the title and manor being confirmed by a Royal Commission that reported in 1607. It was he who built the second house, running down the slope of the shallow valley towards the fish pond, at right angles to the original one. In a party-wall on the ground floor of this building there is carved, on a lintel over a door leading from the main-hall to a smaller room, the initials I.A. and the date 1585. The lower end of the house is now used as a craft metal workshop, and the upper, which was restored and altered, once in 1759 and again exactly two hundred years later, is still inhabited.  The Queen Anne house  Including John Andros six members of his family were Seigneurs of Sausmarez over a period of nearly two hundred years. The third of these, Amyas Andros, who was a staunch royalist throughout the Civil War, played a distinguished part as liaison between the King's forces which controlled Jersey and the brave royalist garrison of Castle Cornet. After the Restoration, he was made Bailiff by Charles II, being one of the only two prominent Guernseymen who were not obliged to seek pardon from their Sovereign for their conduct during the Grand Rebellion. His son, Sir Edmund Andros, was in 1674 both Bailiff and Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey and at the same time Governor of the Colony of New York as well as New England, North Carolina, Virginia, Massachusetts, New Plymouth and New Jersey. In fact it was he, who changed the name from New Amsterdam to New York, when he was its first British Governor. Very little of his time seems to have been spent in Guernsey, for he retired to live in Westminster. One of his reasons for doing so appears from the following clause in his will, dated 1713. Clearly Sir Edmund did not consider the old Tudor Manor House to be worthy of a man of his station. Moreover, he contemplated rebuilding it himself. The great beauty of the building and the strong touches of New England influence that it displays indicate that the plans were prepared for him in London before his death in 1714. The work was duly carried out by John Andros during the next four years, though the clause quoted suggests that he did so with some reluctance and under the threat of sanctions! The fa√ßade, built of grey granite with red granite coigns is of beautiful proportions. The house, all the outer walls of which are two feet thick in thickness, is four storeys high and has two rooms on each floor. It originally had no communication with any of the earlier buildings. The main entrance is from a flight of eight steps leading to the oaken front door on the first floor. This door opens upon a hall whence a typical Queen Anne staircase rises to the top of the house, and ends with a door giving access to a widows walk, from which can be had a fine view of the greater part of the Island. The next Seigneur, Charles Andros, succeeded his uncle John in 1746. Within two years he had sold the house and fief back to the de Sausmarez family to whose history we must now return. Having lost their connection with the manor house and fief as a result of their cousin Judith's marriage to John Andros, some members of the younger branch of the de Sausmarez family became, like so many of the fellow islanders in the 16th and 17th centuries, wool merchants with their chief markets in France. In the days of Charles II a Michel de Sausmarez (b.1655) had a shop in Paris where he sold woollen goods, principally stockings, provided for him by a cousin from an efficiently organised Guernsey cottage industry. Among his customers was Prince Rupert of the Rhine who ordered some of his clothes from the French Capital. Yet despite this high patronage the wool trade was by then in decline as a consequence of a change in fashion greatly stimulated by the French King, Louis XIV, who made his nobles dress in silk and satin in order to attend his court at Versailles. The firm faced ruin, but Michel's eldest son Matthew (b.1685), from whom all members of the family today are descended, was a man of imagination and energy. He married Anne Durell, the daughter of a rich Jersey Jurat and niece of Sir Edward de Carteret, retired Governor of New Jersey, and with the money she brought him fitted out some of the earliest of those Guernsey privateers on the activities of which, legal or otherwise, the wealth of the island was in the 18th century so largely to rely. It is not unreasonable to suppose that Matthew, on some visit to France, noticed how profitable the corsairs were proving to the citizens of the port of St. Malo and decided to take a leaf out of his neighbours' book. In addition to being a pioneer of privateering he was also in practice in Guernsey as an advocate. His eldest son, John, was like him a member of the Guernsey bar and for 38 years held succession the two Law Offices of the Crown, those of Controllor and Procurer. His second son, Philip, was the first of many of the family to serve in the Royal Navy. The latter, after a most promising career, in the course of which he sailed round the world with Commodore George Anson in , was put in command of the great Spanish galleon, the richest prize ever, captured during his voyage. He was killed in action and left a considerable fortune, derived from prize money, to his family. This windfall certainly helped John to buy back the fief and Manor House from Charles Andros in 1748. A third son, Matthew, was the father of Admiral James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez. The gates of the Manor with their heraldic devices Having regained the house of his ancestors John de Sausmarez celebrated his return by putting up the gates which are a well known feature of Sausmarez Road. Their outer pillars each bear the family crest of a falcon displayed, the two inner ones a unicorn and a greyhound, the supporters of the family arms. These were all the work of Sir Henry Cheere, the celebrated 18th-century sculptor who also made the memorial to Philip Saumarez in Westminster Abbey. In 1759 John restored the upper end of the Tudor manor house and added a new entrance to it.  The Regency house  John's heir, his eldest son Matthew, was Seigneur from 1774 to 1820. His main contribution to the estate was the building of the walls which enclose the potager, (vegetable garden) the orchard and the tennis court and the restoration of the old barn facing the Tudor house and to the south-west of it. When he died he was succeeded by his brother Thomas who, like his father, was both Controller and Procureur, though for an even longer period of fifty-five years. Thomas had been a fiery youth who, in 1790, had fought a successful duel against his cousin Robert le Marchant, a son of the bailiff of that day, the repercussions of which provoked considerable discussion in fashionable London circles. Thomas eventually settled down to have an enormous family. His two marriages brought him twenty-eight children. Though some of these died in infancy, he still had many who were not yet of age when he moved into the Manor. He therefore found the Andros house too small for his needs, and was obliged to build on to the back of it. His plans for it show it to have been a pleasant addition. It had a large breakfast room on the first floor and several bedrooms on this and the two upper floors. A central passage separated it on each floor from the Queen Anne house. On the ground floor, what is now part of a kitchen was originally used as the Procureur's office. Little (it is impossible to say how much) of this Regency house, which began in the last year of George III's reign, remains. Some of the doors and one of the bedroom windows are still clearly identifiable as is part of the roof. But the greater portion of it was pulled down by Thomas's youngest son, General George de Sausmarez who, having bought his brothers' shares of the property, became Seigneur and in 1873 began building the last and final additions to the family home with typical mid-Victorian gusto, employing a Parisian garden designer who had ambitious plans which would not be fulfilled.  The Victorian house  The General had had a distinguished career in the service of the East India Company. An expert in small-arms training and a reformer in military administration he never saw a shot fired in war. In the Indian mutiny his, the Madras, command was the only one which had no mutineers. Yet though he won no great glory like Havelock and Colin Campbell, his was a lucrative post which enabled him on his return to Guernsey to indulge to the full his somewhat liberal and not always irreproachable taste. Having pulled down most of his father's Regency house, he replaced it on the first floor with a large dining- room and still larger drawing-room. Despite the unfortunate appearance which their windows and general design present from outside, in strong contrast to the Queen Anne facade, the interiors of these rooms have a peculiar charm. The same startling mixture of happy and unhappy touches of inspiration characterise the large entrance-hall which the General built on the north-east side of the Queen Anne house to link it with the Tudor one. The main feature of this hall and gallery is a riotous medley of wood-carving, some of it Burmese, some of it copies of the same by a local craftsman and some of it consisting of Old Testament figures and scenes, believed to have been acquired from Breton churches where they had been put up for sale. The whole presents an effect which, one feels, would meet with the approval of John Betjeman with his sympathetic eye for such Victorian fantasy. After the General's death his widow lived on at the Manor, as Dame, with her sister and brother until her death in 1915. She was succeeded in the Seigneurie by her nephew, Sir Havilland de Sausmarez who, after a distinguished judicial career in the service of the Foreign Office, including serving as Chief Judge of the British Supreme Court for China for 16 years became the second member of his family to hold the office of Bailiff of Guernsey. He died during the German occupation of the Island. His persistent refusal to install electric light saved the manor from being requisitioned by the occupying power. His nephew, the late Seigneur, Cecil de Sausmarez (1907-1986), after a distinguished career in the Diplomatic Service and whilst a successful people deputy carried out an extensive programme of restoration and modernisation of the property.

Many plants contain derivatives, collectively known as cardenolides, including many in the form of cardenolide glycosides (cardenolides that contain structural groups derived from sugars). Cardenolide glycosides are often toxic; specifically, they are heart- arresting. Etymology The term derives from card- \\"heart\\" (from Greek Œ∫Œ±œÅŒ¥ŒØŒ± kardiƒÅ) and the suffix -enolide, referring to the lactone ring at C17. Cardanolides are a class of steroids (or aglycones if viewed as cardiac glycoside constituents), and cardenolides are a subtype of this class (see MeSH D codes list). Structure Cardenolides are C(23)-steroids with methyl groups at C-10 and C-13 and a five-membered lactone (specifically a butenolide) at C-17. They are aglycone constituents of cardiac glycosides and must have at least one double bond in the molecule. The class includes cardadienolides and cardatrienolides. Members include: *acetyldigitoxins *acetyldigoxins *cymarine *digitoxin *digitoxigenin *digoxigenin *digoxin *medigoxin *neoconvalloside *ouabain *strophanthins *strophanthidin Bufadienolide and Marinobufagenin are similar in structure and function. Cardanolide is the same core structure but having a saturated lactone ring instead of one containing an alkene. As defense mechanism Some plant and animal species use cardenolides as defense mechanisms, notably the milkweed butterflies. Species such as the monarch, queen, and plain tiger ingest the cardenolides contained in the milkweeds (Asclepias) that they mostly feed on and sequester as larvae for defense as adults. The cardenolide content in butterflies deters most vertebrate predators, except a few which have evolved to become cardenolide-tolerant, such as the black-backed orioles (Icterus abeillei Lesson) and black-headed grosbeaks (Pheucticus melanocephalus Swainson) that account for 60% of monarch butterfly mortalities in the overwintering sites in central Mexico. In addition to milkweeds and other members of the Apocynaceae, plants in at least 12 botanical families have convergently evolved cardenolides.

The Paris Boys Choir (Les Petits Chanteurs de Sainte-Croix de Neuilly) is a boys' choir created in 1956 at Coll√®ge Sainte-Croix de Neuilly in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, France. Louis Prudhomme founded the choir in 1956, as a revival to one of the Coll√®ge's oldest institutions: the Schola, an elite choir born at the same time as Sainte-Croix itself and much celebrated at the time by poet and alumnus Henry de Montherlant. Prudhomme significantly developed the choir's activities and built strong ties with the nascent Pueri Cantores federation, instituted by Monseigneur Maillet ‚Äì the founder of Les Petits Chanteurs √† la Croix de Bois ‚Äì making it one France's utmost children's choirs.

Faithful to his predecessor's philosophy and impetus, Polg√°r embarked the choir on a path of radical modernization. Les Petits Chanteurs de Sainte-Croix de Neuilly were redeployed into a \\"Ma√Ætrise\\": a specially adapted curriculum was crafted at Sainte-Croix for boy pupils willing to practice intensive choir singing and live a unique experience based on music apprenticeship and teamwork, while pursuing regular academic studies. The choir contributes to the Coll√®ge's milestone ceremonies and is at the heart of the students' musical experience. It makes frequent appearances in world-class festivals (Oxford, Aix-en-Provence, Auvers-sur-Oise, Wengen, etc.) and regularly performs great pieces with orchestra (Mozart's Requiem, Faur√©'s Requiem, Handel's Messiah, etc.). Its repertoire also includes a variety of a cappella liturgical and profane songs. Every summer, The Paris Boys Choir go on tour, in France and around the world. They have performed in every region in France, and they have also sung including the US, the UK, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Canada, numerous Eastern European countries.

Personal life  In 1986, Kennedy married Yvedt Matory, a cancer surgeon. They have three children: Henry, Rachel and Thaddeus. Yvedt Matory died on April 15, 2005, of complications arising from melanoma. Career=Academia In 1984 Kennedy joined the faculty at Harvard Law School, teaching courses on race, relations, law and freedom of expression. Kennedy first came to prominence as a legal- academic scholar when he began addressing affirmative action. In 1997, Kennedy published Race, Crime, and the Law, which received a Robert F. Kennedy Book Award in 1998. \\"This book is a brave, honest, forceful intervention in that debate,\\" wrote William A. Galston and David Wasserman in the Wilson Quarterly. The same article noted: \\"With restrained passion, he documents the myriad ways in which our legal system has betrayed the principle of fair and equal treatment for African Americans.\\" While Kennedy argues in the book that African Americans have suffered at the hands of the criminal justice system, he also notes that blacks have committed a \\"notably large proportion\\" of the crimes that people are most afraid of (robbery, rape, murder, aggravated assault). He likewise points out that the need to protect black communities from crime has often been neglected. Galston and Wasserman wrote, \\"Too often, says Kennedy, black leaders show more concern for black perpetrators of crime than for their black victims.\\"William Galston and David Wasserman. Review of Randall Kennedy‚Äôs Race, Crime, and the Law. Wilson Quarterly, Spring 1997, p. 100. Views Kennedy is known as a scholar who is unafraid of tackling socially difficult issues, such as racism. He has written for academic and popular journals, published several books, and served on the editorial boards of the magazines American Prospect and The Nation. Kennedy has written extensively on interracial marriages and adoptions, and on the relationship between race and crime. His views have won acclaim but they have also courted controversy. \\"One of the things they [critics] find disconcerting is that I ask questions,\\" Kennedy told Lawrence Donegan in the London Observer. \\"I actually question the premise of my own thinking and push my own conclusions hard. I thought that was what intellectuals were supposed to do.\\" Despite the firestorm created by his published work, Donegan noted that Kennedy's \\"colleagues variously describe him as brilliant, well-read and personable.\\"Lawrence Donegan, \\"The battle of the N-word\\", The Guardian, 20 January 2002. In 2002 more controversy erupted when Kennedy published Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word. \\"The power of 'Nigger,'\\" noted Charles Taylor in Salon, \\"is that Kennedy writes fully of the word, neither condemning its every use nor fantasizing that it can ever become solely a means of empowerment.\\" In this slim volume Kennedy explores the history of the controversial word, noting that the meaning varies according to the person using it and the context of its use. \\"I'm not saying that any particular instance of using the N-word is any more horrifying and menacing than any other such word,\\" he told Daniel Smith in The Atlantic. \\"I am saying that from a broad sociological view, the word is associated with more havoc in American society than other racial slurs.\\"Daniel Smith, \\"That Word: Interview of Randall Kennedy\\". The Atlantic, January 17, 2002. In Interracial Intimacies: Sex, Marriage, Identity and Adoption, published in 2003, Kennedy attempts to bring greater understanding to the racial issues that continue to trouble American society. \\"His premise is based on common sense,\\" wrote Emily Bernard in Black Issues Book Review.Bernard, Emily, \\"Interracial Intimacies\\" (Book Review), Black Issues Book Review, March 1, 2003. \\"Until Americans confront racial bias in the most intimate arenas of their lives, we will continue to live with racism and its consequences.\\" Unlike a number of black intellectuals, Kennedy has supported interracial adoption. \\"Parenting is a mysterious thing,\\" he told Lise Funderburg in Essence. \\"People will learn what they need to learn in order to help their child along. I'm willing to assume that with respect to all parents, including White people who want to adopt Black kids.\\"Lise Funderburg, \\"The Essence Dialogue: Who Should Adopt Our Children? Interview with Randall Kennedy\\", Essence Magazine, January 1998. Kennedy also explores interracial marriages throughout American history as well as their presence in literature and film. \\"There is something hopeful in Kennedy's historical accounts,\\" noted Bernard. \\"In spite of the law ... some individuals managed to maintain honorable and nuanced relationships with people they were legally forbidden to approach as equals.\\"Bernard. Ibid Kennedy's views have proved controversial even among other black intellectuals. Darcus Howe noted of Nigger in New Statesman, \\"Had a white person used the word, rejection would have been immediate. Now white society can always point to Kennedy and say that a negro advanced the view that 'nigger' is acceptable.\\"Darcus Howe, \\"The prof says it's OK to use 'nigger'. But he's brown, not black\\", New Statesman, 28 January 2002. Many black scholars have labeled his work conservative, and worry that books like Race, Crime, and the Law provide political cover for traditional academics. \\"Over the years,\\" wrote Derrick Bell, \\"Professor Kennedy has become the impartial, black intellectual, commenting on our still benighted condition and as ready to criticize as commend.\\"Bell. Ibid When asked by Kate Tuttle of Africana how he felt about the controversy over Nigger, Kennedy replied: \\"What's the worst that happens? That someone writes a very long diatribe in The New Yorker excoriating me.... I'm not facing firing squads, I'm not facing exile, I'm not facing jail.\\"Tuttle, Kathleen. Interview with Randall Kennedy. Africana, 28 January 2002. Current activities Through numerous appearances on the lecture circuit, Kennedy continues to promote debate on hot-button racial issues in the public arena. \\"If you are socially isolated,\\" he told Regan Goode in The New York Times, \\"you are more vulnerable to stereotypes and myths, you won't have the opportunity to have conversations with someone who has a different social background than you.\\"Regan Goode. The Way We Live Now: Questions for Randall Kennedy; Color Dynamics. The New York Times. 2-9-03. While many critics have attempted to use Kennedy's work to advance their own agendas, he has retained his academic independence. \\"Against black pessimists,\\" wrote Galston and Wasserman, argues that substantial progress has been made toward the ideal of color-blind justice. Against complacent whites, he argues that there is still a long way to go.\\"Galston and Wasserman. Ibid The relationship between white and black America, Kennedy noted, remains one of America's most perplexing problems. \\"Obviously there are all sorts of ethnic, racial conflicts in American society,\\" Kennedy told Smith, \\"but there's one that is deeper than all the others and that's white/black racial conflict.\\"Smith. Ibid Kennedy currently serves as a trustee of Princeton University. Kennedy is also a board director at The National Coalition Against Censorship.

Since that time, VCHC has grown to a comprehensive community development corporation with family support programs, gang prevention programs, job training and affordable housing. Mission VCHC‚Äôs mission is to preserve the economic, racial and social diversity of Venice and the surrounding area, by maximizing affordable housing, economic and community development opportunities and by providing needed social services to low income residents, while ignoring the desires of local residents with our mission only at heart. History The community of Venice has historically opened its doors to a wide diversity of people, including many African Americans restricted from home ownership in other parts of Los Angeles, low-income Latinos displaced by freeway development, starving artists, wandering youth and older citizens on fixed incomes. In 1988, the Mayor‚Äôs Blue Ribbon Committee for Affordable Housing identified an emerging housing crisis in Los Angeles, fueled ‚Äì- especially on the coast ‚Äì- by escalating rents and property values.Khouri, Andrew (28 May 2014) \\"Shortage of affordable housing is dire in L.A. County, advocates say\\" Los Angeles Times The resulting gentrification was already threatening the rich diversity that made up the Venice community. The same year, VCHC was founded with a mission to preserve, maintain and expand affordable housing opportunities for low-income families in Venice and the surrounding neighborhoods. In 1994, responding to heightened gang violence in these neighborhoods, VCHC broadened its mission to add economic development opportunities and family support services. Background Affordable housing deregulation and welfare reform have compounded the housing problem in Venice, but residents face additional barriers to success. Venice‚Äôs Oakwood neighborhood and adjacent Mar Vista are pockets of extreme poverty and crime in the midst of an otherwise relatively affluent part of the City. The Los Angeles Police Department has reported that 90% of the crime in the Pacific policing division occurs in the two square miles of Oakwood and Mar Vista. Programs and Services VCHC offers a variety of programs that work synergistically to foster stable, self-reliant individuals, families and neighborhoods. These include: Affordable Housing VCHC‚Äôs flagship program, provides 175 units of affordable housing in 13 buildings in Venice and Mar Vista, including a 32-bed transitional shelter for formerly homeless mothers and their children and 31 units dedicated for formerly homeless individuals who have substance abuse and/or mental health issues. Tenant Services On-site family services at housing facilities include CommunityWorks for Kids, an after school arts, education and recreation program for tenants in our buildings ages 6‚Äì12 and, case management to help formerly homeless, disabled tenants stay housed and reach their full potential in life. Infant Toddler Development Center The onsite Infant Toddler Development Center cares for very young children, ages three months to three years, while their parents pursue employment and educational opportunities and access long-term case management. VCHC offers the childcare program in partnership with two neighboring organizations, St. Joseph Center and the Venice Family Clinic. YouthBuild YouthBuild trains at-risk youth in the construction trades, helps develop leadership skills, supports them to obtain their high school diplomas or GEDs, and connects them to jobs so they can transition into long-term employment or continue educational pursuits. Another Chance Another Chance is an on-site charter school that provides out of school youth with an education in order to help them earn a high school diploma. Venice High School Teen Court Teen Court is a peer-based system that provides an alternative to the juvenile system for young people accused of first-time minor offenses, while providing participants an inside view of the legal system. The program is a partnership between VCHC, L.A. County Probation Dept. and Venice High School. HandyWorker Under contract with the Los Angeles Housing Department, VCHC provides free minor home repairs for low-income elderly and disabled homeowners. YouthBuild trainees have an opportunity to assist skilled trades people and gain first-hand experience in this program. VCHC Study Lounge (formerly L.A. Bridges) VCHC Study Lounge, formerly known as L.A. Bridges, is an after school program at the Mark Twain Middle School for youth, ages 10‚Äì14, who are at high risk for gang involvement. Services include mentoring, tutoring, life and leadership skills, case management and recreational activities. Westside Repair and Painting Services (WRAPS) WRAPS provides quality, timely, and affordable home repair services to Los Angeles residents and property managers while generating income to support VCHC's vital programs; creating training and transitional employment opportunities for YouthBuild Trainees; and preserving housing. Venice Music Festival The Venice Music Festival is an annual community event, generally held in the fall, organized by the VCHC. A Champagne Brunch kicks off the event and the afternoon features musical performances, a silent auction, and activities such as rock climbing. Past featured artists include Los Pinguos, Afrobeat Down, Aula, Sono-Lux, and Kwanza Jones. Proceeds are used to support the VCHC. References *Venice Community Housing Corporation.

They fled to France together when he resigned in 1986; they divorced in 1990. Early life Mich√®le Bennett was born in Port‚Äëau‚ÄëPrince, Haiti, in 1950, the daughter of Aurore() and ErnestBennett, a Haitian businessman and descendant of of Haiti. Her father owned more than of land, growing mostly coffee, and employing 1,600 estate workers in addition to 900 more in his business. Her uncle was Haiti's Roman Catholic Archbishop Monsignor The Bennetts are light‚Äëskinned mulattoes (of mixed race) from a largely black country. At 15, Bennett moved to New York, where she was educated at St. Mary's School in Peekskill. She went on to work as a secretary at a slipper company in New York City‚Äôs Garment District. In 1973, she married Alix Pasquet, Jr., the son of Captain Alix Pasquet, a well known mulatto officer and Tuskegee Airman who in 1958 led a coup attempt against Fran√ßois Duvalier. By Pasquet she had two children, Alix III and Sacha. After her 1978 divorce from Pasquet, she had a career in public relations for Habitation LeClerc, an upscale hotel in Port‚Äëau‚ÄëPrince. Marriage Although Bennett met Jean‚ÄëClaude Duvalier in high school, the pair did not become romantically engaged until ten years later. In 1980, Bennett married President Duvalier. Their wedding, Haiti's social event of the decade, cost an unprecedented US$2million and was received enthusiastically by the majority of Haitians. Mich√®le Duvalier at first endeared herself to the population by distributing clothes and food to the needy as well as opening several medical clinics and schools for the poor. In the six weeks following the wedding, Mich√®le and Jean‚ÄëClaude toured Haiti, turning up unannounced at meetings, marketplaces, and other gathering places, which garnered ‚Äúapproving glances and words most everywhere‚Äù. On a visit to Haiti, Mother Teresa remarked that she had ‚Äúnever seen the poor people being so familiar with their head of state as they were with ‚Äù. With Jean‚ÄëClaude, Mich√®le had her third and fourth children: Nicolas and Anya. The marriage represented a symbolic alliance with the mulatto elite, the families Jean‚ÄëClaude‚Äôs father had opposed. This resulted in her husband's mother, Simone Duvalier, who opposed the match, being sidelined politically, which in turn created new factional alliances within the ruling group since the Duvalierist Old Guard opined that the new First Lady's power appeared to exceed her husband's. While Jean‚ÄëClaude often dozed through Cabinet meetings, his wife, frustrated at his political ineptitude, reprimanded ministers herself. First lady Accusations of or associations with corruption plagued the Duvalier‚ÄìBennett marriage. Mich√®le's father, Ernest Bennett, took advantage of his presidential connection to extend interests into his businesses, from his BMW dealership, to his coffee and cocoa export concerns, to Air Haiti, in whose planes Bennett was rumored to be transporting drugs. In 1982, Frantz Bennett, Mich√®le's brother, was arrested in Puerto Rico for drug trafficking, and began a three‚Äëyear jail term. Mich√®le Duvalier's family amassed wealth during the later part of Jean‚ÄëClaude‚Äôs dictatorship. By the end of his fifteen‚Äëyear rule, Duvalier and his wife had become famous for their corruption. The National Palace became the scene of opulent costume parties, where the young President once appeared dressed as a Turkish sultan to dole out ten‚Äëthousand‚Äëdollar jewels as door prizes. While on a visit to Haiti in 1983, declared that ‚Äúthings must change in Haiti‚Äù, and he called on ‚Äúall those who have power, riches and culture so that they can understand the serious and urgent responsibility to help their brothers and sisters‚Äù. Popular uprising against the regime began soon after that. Duvalier responded with a 10%reduction in staple food prices, the closing of independent radio stations, a cabinet reshuffle, and a crackdown by police and army units, but these moves failed to dampen the momentum of the popular uprising. Jean‚ÄëClaude‚Äôs wife and advisers urged him to put down the rebellion in order to remain in office. In response to widening opposition to 28 years of Duvalier rule, on 7 February 1986, the Duvaliers fled the rioting country in an American plane accompanied by 19 other people. Exile The governments of Greece, Spain, Switzerland, Gabon and Morocco all refused the Duvalier family's requests for asylum. France agreed to give the Duvaliers temporary entry but also denied them asylum. Soon after their arrival in France, their home was raided as part of an investigation into pillaging Haiti‚Äôs treasury. Bennett was found trying to flush documentation down a toilet. Her papers documented recent spending including US$168,780 for Givenchy clothing, US$270,200 for Boucheron jewelry and US$9,752 for two children's horse saddles at Herm√®s. In 1987, a French civil court dismissed Haiti‚Äôs lawsuit against the Duvaliers, which sought to have the Duvaliers held responsible to repay money to Haiti. In 1990, Jean‚ÄëClaude Duvalier filed for divorce from Bennett in the Dominican Republic, accusing her of immoral acts. Bennett, who was living with another man in Cannes at the time, contested the decision, flying to the Dominican Republic to obtain a reversal before her husband prevailed in a third court. She was awarded alimony and child support. In the wake of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Bennett returned to Haiti with a search and rescue team to look for her brother RudyBennett in the rubble of the H√¥tel Montana. Bennett returned to Haiti for Jean‚ÄëClaude Duvalier's funeral on 11 October 2014. She attended with her two children from their marriage, at a chapel on the grounds of the Institution Saint-Louis de Gonzague school in the Delmas district of Port‚Äëau‚ÄëPrince.

In probability and statistics, the quantile function, associated with a probability distribution of a random variable, specifies the value of the random variable such that the probability of the variable being less than or equal to that value equals the given probability. It is also called the percent-point function or inverse cumulative distribution function. Definition With reference to a continuous and strictly monotonic distribution function, for example the cumulative distribution function F_X\\\\colon R \\\\to [0,1] of a random variable X, the quantile function Q returns a threshold value x below which random draws from the given c.d.f would fall p percent of the time. In terms of the distribution function F, the quantile function Q returns the value x such that :F_X(x) := \\\\Pr(X \\\\le x) = p.\\\\, The cumulative distribution function (shown as F(x)) gives the p values as a function of the q values. The quantile function does the opposite: it gives the q values as a function of the p values. Another way to express the quantile function is :Q(p)\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\inf\\\\left{ x\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} : p \\\\le F(x) \\\\right} for a probability 0 < p < 1\\\\. Here we capture the fact that the quantile function returns the minimum value of x from amongst all those values whose c.d.f value exceeds p, which is equivalent to the previous probability statement in the special case that the distribution is continuous. Note that the infimum function can be replaced by the minimum function, since the distribution function is right-continuous and weakly monotonically increasing. The quantile is the unique function satisfying the Galois inequalities :Q(p) \\\\le x if and only if p \\\\le F(x) If the function F is continuous and strictly monotonically increasing, then the inequalities can be replaced by equalities, and we have: :Q = F^{-1} In general, even though the distribution function F may fail to possess a left or right inverse, the quantile function Q behaves as an \\"almost sure left inverse\\" for the distribution function, in the sense that : Q(F(X))=X almost surely.  Simple example  For example, the cumulative distribution function of Exponential(Œª) (i.e. intensity Œª and expected value (mean) 1/Œª) is :F(x;\\\\lambda) = \\\\begin{cases} 1-e^{-\\\\lambda x} & x \\\\ge 0, \\\\ 0 & x < 0\\\\. \\\\end{cases} The quantile function for Exponential(Œª) is derived by finding the value of Q for which 1-e^{-\\\\lambda Q} =p : :Q(p;\\\\lambda) = \\\\frac{-\\\\ln(1-p)}{\\\\lambda}, ! for 0 ‚â§ p < 1\\\\. The quartiles are therefore: ; first quartile (p = 1/4): -\\\\ln(3/4)/\\\\lambda\\\\, ; median (p = 2/4) : -\\\\ln(1/2)/\\\\lambda\\\\, ; third quartile (p = 3/4) : -\\\\ln(1/4)/\\\\lambda.\\\\, Applications Quantile functions are used in both statistical applications and Monte Carlo methods. The quantile function is one way of prescribing a probability distribution, and it is an alternative to the probability density function (pdf) or probability mass function, the cumulative distribution function (cdf) and the characteristic function. The quantile function, Q, of a probability distribution is the inverse of its cumulative distribution function F. The derivative of the quantile function, namely the quantile density function, is yet another way of prescribing a probability distribution. It is the reciprocal of the pdf composed with the quantile function. For statistical applications, users need to know key percentage points of a given distribution. For example, they require the median and 25% and 75% quartiles as in the example above or 5%, 95%, 2.5%, 97.5% levels for other applications such as assessing the statistical significance of an observation whose distribution is known; see the quantile entry. Before the popularization of computers, it was not uncommon for books to have appendices with statistical tables sampling the quantile function. Statistical applications of quantile functions are discussed extensively by Gilchrist. Monte-Carlo simulations employ quantile functions to produce non-uniform random or pseudorandom numbers for use in diverse types of simulation calculations. A sample from a given distribution may be obtained in principle by applying its quantile function to a sample from a uniform distribution. The demands, for example, of simulation methods in modern computational finance are focusing increasing attention on methods based on quantile functions, as they work well with multivariate techniques based on either copula or quasi- Monte-Carlo methods and Monte Carlo methods in finance.  Properties  \\\\int_0^1 ppf(x)\\\\,dx=\\\\mu (Integral of inverse functions, Inverse transform sampling) Calculation The evaluation of quantile functions often involves numerical methods, as the example of the exponential distribution above is one of the few distributions where a closed-form expression can be found (others include the uniform, the Weibull, the Tukey lambda (which includes the logistic) and the log-logistic). When the cdf itself has a closed-form expression, one can always use a numerical root-finding algorithm such as the bisection method to invert the cdf. Other algorithms to evaluate quantile functions are given in the Numerical Recipes series of books. Algorithms for common distributions are built into many statistical software packages. Quantile functions may also be characterized as solutions of non-linear ordinary and partial differential equations. The ordinary differential equations for the cases of the normal, Student, beta and gamma distributions have been given and solved. Normal distribution The normal distribution is perhaps the most important case. Because the normal distribution is a location-scale family, its quantile function for arbitrary parameters can be derived from a simple transformation of the quantile function of the standard normal distribution, known as the probit function. Unfortunately, this function has no closed-form representation using basic algebraic functions; as a result, approximate representations are usually used. Thorough composite rational and polynomial approximations have been given by Wichura and Acklam.An algorithm for computing the inverse normal cumulative distribution function Non-composite rational approximations have been developed by Shaw.Computational Finance: Differential Equations for Monte Carlo Recycling =Ordinary differential equation for the normal quantile= A non-linear ordinary differential equation for the normal quantile, w(p), may be given. It is :\\\\frac{d^2 w}{d p^2} = w \\\\left(\\\\frac{d w}{d p}\\\\right)^2 with the centre (initial) conditions :w\\\\left(1/2\\\\right) = 0,\\\\, :w'\\\\left(1/2\\\\right) = \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}.\\\\, This equation may be solved by several methods, including the classical power series approach. From this solutions of arbitrarily high accuracy may be developed (see Steinbrecher and Shaw, 2008). Student's t-distribution This has historically been one of the more intractable cases, as the presence of a parameter, ŒΩ, the degrees of freedom, makes the use of rational and other approximations awkward. Simple formulas exist when the ŒΩ = 1, 2, 4 and the problem may be reduced to the solution of a polynomial when ŒΩ is even. In other cases the quantile functions may be developed as power series. The simple cases are as follows: ;ŒΩ = 1 (Cauchy distribution) :Q(p) = \\\\tan (\\\\pi(p-1/2)) ! ;ŒΩ = 2 :Q(p) = 2(p-1/2)\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\alpha}}! ;ŒΩ = 4 :Q(p) = \\\\operatorname{sign}(p-1/2)\\\\,2\\\\,\\\\sqrt{q-1}! where :q = \\\\frac{\\\\cos \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\arccos \\\\left( \\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha} \\\\, \\\\right) \\\\right)}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha}}! and :\\\\alpha = 4p(1-p).! In the above the \\"sign\\" function is +1 for positive arguments, -1 for negative arguments and zero at zero. It should not be confused with the trigonometric sine function. Quantile mixtures Analogously to the mixtures of densities, distributions can be defined as quantile mixtures :Q(p)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{m}a_i Q_i(p), where Q_i(p), i=1,\\\\ldots,m are quantile functions and a_i, i=1,\\\\ldots,m are the model parameters. The parameters a_i must be selected so that Q(p) is a quantile function. Two four- parametric quantile mixtures, the normal-polynomial quantile mixture and the Cauchy-polynomial quantile mixture, are presented by Karvanen. Non-linear differential equations for quantile functions The non-linear ordinary differential equation given for normal distribution is a special case of that available for any quantile function whose second derivative exists. In general the equation for a quantile, Q(p), may be given. It is :\\\\frac{d^2 Q}{d p^2} = H(Q) \\\\left(\\\\frac{d Q}{d p}\\\\right)^2 augmented by suitable boundary conditions, where : H(x) = -\\\\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} and ∆í(x) is the probability density function. The forms of this equation, and its classical analysis by series and asymptotic solutions, for the cases of the normal, Student, gamma and beta distributions has been elucidated by Steinbrecher and Shaw (2008). Such solutions provide accurate benchmarks, and in the case of the Student, suitable series for live Monte Carlo use.

The territory to the north is the Danish March/March of Schleswig, while that to the east is the Limes Saxoniae. Obotrite confederation about 800-814 Nordalbingia () (also Northern Albingia) was one of the four administrative regions of the medieval Duchy of Saxony, the others being Angria, Eastphalia, and Westphalia. The region's name is based on the Latin name Alba for the Elbe River and refers to an area predominantly located north of the Lower Elbe, roughly corresponding with the present-day Holstein region. Situated in what is now Northern Germany, this is the earliest known dominion of the Saxons. Geography According to the 1076 Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum by chronicler Adam of Bremen, Nordalbingia consisted of three tribal areas (Gaue): *Dithmarschen, stretching along the coast of the North Sea from the mouth of the Elbe River to the Eider River in the north *Holstein proper, situated on the St√∂r River, a right tributary of the Elbe *Stormarn on the north bank of the Elbe, including the present-day area of Hamburg. The Nordalbingian tribes were allied with the Saxons settling in Land Hadeln (Haduloha) south of the Elbe. In the east, the Limes Saxoniae, an inaccessible region between the Elbe and today's Kiel Fjord on the Baltic Sea, formed a natural border with the Wagria lands settled by Slavic Obotrites. History In 772, Charlemagne, ruler of the Franks, started the Saxon Wars to conquer the lands of the North German Plain. According to the Royal Frankish Annals, the Westphalian noble Widukind refused to appear at the 777 Imperial Diet in Paderborn and fled across the Elbe to Nordalbingia (or possibly further to the court of the Danish king Sigfred). Even after Widukind's submission and Christianization in 785, the Nordalbingian tribes remained reluctant until they were finally defeated at the 798 Battle of Bornh√∂ved by the combined forces of the Franks and their Obotrite allies led by Prince Dro≈ºko. The Saxons lost 4,000 people, 10,000 families of Saxons were deported to other areas of the Carolingian Empire. The areas north of the Elbe were at first given to the Obotrites, while Land Hadeln was directly incorporated. However, Nordalbingia soon was invaded by the Danes and only the intervention of Charlemagne's son Charles the Younger in 808 pushed them back across the Eider River. The next year the emperor had Esesfeld Castle erected near present-day Itzehoe and the entire region was incorporated into the Frankish Empire. In order to encounter the ongoing invasions led by King Sigfred's successor Gudfred, the Franks probably established a Danish march stretching from the Eider River to the Danevirke fortifications in the north. After King Gudfred was killed, his successor Hemming concluded the Treaty of Heiligen with Charlemagne in 811, whereafter the Eider should mark the border between Denmark and Francia. However, quarrels between both sides would continue for more than a century until the East Frankish king Henry the Fowler finally defeated the Danish forces of King Gnupa at Hedeby in 934. After Charlemagne's death in 814, the Nordalbingian Saxons were pardoned and their land restored to them from the Obotrites.History of Vandalia by Thomas Nugent According to some sources, the emperor had intended to establish a diocese of Nordalbingia headed by the priest Heridag. This plan was abandoned after Heridag's death, and the region came to be assigned to the dioceses of Bremen and Verden during the reign of Emperor Louis the Pious, when Ansgar was appointed Archbishop at Hamburg in 831.

It currently plays in no football league, after being excluded from Serie C during the course of the 2020‚Äì21 season. They are nicknamed the Granata (the Maroons), after their kit colour. History=In brief During the club's history they have played mostly in the Serie C and D leagues. In the 2013‚Äì14 season, they played in Serie B for the first time in the club's history. To date the highest league position the club has finished after the 1929‚Äì30 season was 2nd in the third highest level of Italian football, a position the club attained 3 times, in the Prima Divisione during the 1934‚Äì35 season,1934‚Äì35 Prima Divisione ‚Äì Girone H in the Serie C during the 1960‚Äì61 season1960‚Äì61 Serie C ‚Äì Girone C and again during the 1962‚Äì63 season.1962‚Äì63 Serie C ‚Äì Girone C Before the 1929‚Äì30 season, the club played for one season at the then highest level football division in the 1921‚Äì22 season,1921‚Äì22 Prima Divisione (CCI) ‚Äì Sicily but retired during the championship, forfeiting the last 6 matches. In recent years, the highest league position the club attained was 4th in the third highest level of Italian football, then called Serie C1, during the 1994‚Äì95 season,1994‚Äì95 Serie C1 ‚Äì Girone B a result that was bettered in the 2011‚Äì12 season when Trapani achieved a second place in the same division. Throughout their long history, Trapani have won at least six recorded league championships in various divisions. Foundation The club's roots can be traced back to 1905;RSSSF.com on 2 April of that year, local newspaper the Gazzetta di Trapani ran an advert requesting young people to form a football association for Trapani.AleGranata.com The club founded, by professor Ugolino Montagna and young native Abele Mazzarese to represent the West-Sicilian town was named Unione Sportiva Trapanese. It is one of the oldest teams on the island, after Palermo and Messina. U.S. Trapanese's first president was Giuseppe Platamone and the club played their games at Via Spalti. The first official game for the club came against Palermo in October 1908, the more experienced Palermitan team won emphatically scoring 12 goals. The Trapanese bounced back, however, playing local derbys against teams from Marsala and Erice. In 1915 play was stopped because of World War I. Post-war times After the war, in 1921 three teams had risen up; Vigor, Bencivegna and Drepanum. During the 1921‚Äì22 season Vigor finished 6th in the Sicilian section of the national championship of the C.C.I. (Confederazione Calcistica Italiana). On 22 January 1923 a merger took place between Vigor and Drepanum, the club decided to revive the previous name U.S. Trapanese. In June 1926, the name of the club was changed to A.S. Trapani. In the 1930‚Äì31 season, under the name Juventus Trapani, the club won promotion from III Divisione into II Divisione, the following season they achieved promotion again this time into the early 1930s equivalent of Serie C. They finished 8th in Serie C in the 1942‚Äì43 season, but then football in Italy was put on hold for the Second World War. 1940s, 50s and 60s Just after World War II, the club were using the name A.S. Trapani for one season, before changing its name to A.S. Drepanum. They were entered into Serie C, which, at the time, was divided into many regional groups. For the 1947‚Äì48 season, they qualified for the new, smaller Serie C; even finishing above Messina. Unfortunately for the club, they were relegated down to Serie D, in the 1949‚Äì50 season after finishing second from bottom. 1990s: peak and decline With former Serie A player Ignazio Arcoleo as head coach, Trapani experienced two consecutive promotions from Serie D to Serie C1 in the early 1990s. In 1995, a strong and qualified team composed mostly of young promising players such as Marco Materazzi and more experienced local footballers such as Francesco Galeoto qualified to the promotion play-off, but ultimately lost to Walter Novellino's Gualdo in the semi-finals with a late goal scored on injury time. After that, Trapani experienced a slow but continuous decline, despite attempts to repeat past successes: Arcoleo left Trapani to coach Palermo along some of the best players, including Galeoto. The club then relegated to Serie C2 in 1997, Serie D in 2000 and even Eccellenza in the 2005‚Äì06 season, despite a late attempt by Arcoleo and former star Gaetano Vasari to save the team from relegation. In addition, the club also received a 12-points deduction for the 2006‚Äì07 season following a matchfixing attempt recognized by the Football Federation. In its 2006‚Äì07 Eccellenza campaign, Trapani, coached by former Parma midfielder Tarcisio Catanese, ended the regular season phase to eleventh place, and saved from relegation after having won relegation play-offs to Terrasini in a 5‚Äì0 single- legged win. From 2007 onwards Trapani competed in the Serie D with little success. From Serie D to Serie B In 2009, chairman Vittorio Morace appointed Roberto Boscaglia as new head coach, with the aim to bring the club back into professionalism; in his first season in charge, Trapani ended as runners-up behind Milazzo. However, later in August, due to the high number of resignations of clubs in the higher ranks, Trapani was admitted into the 2010‚Äì11 Lega Pro Seconda Divisione (formerly Serie C2), thus ending the club's 13-year absence from the professional ranks. In 2010‚Äì11, Trapani finished as runners-up in the Lega Pro Seconda Divisione group C, and successively won the promotion play-offs to Lega Pro Prima Divisione. In the first campaign in the third tier, Trapani surprised everyone by topping the league against all odds; an end-of-season crisis, however, led to the Sicilians being overtaken by Spezia in the penultimate week of the season and losing direct promotion. In the subsequent promotion play-offs, Trapani defeated Cremonese in the semi- finals, but then lost a two-legged final to fourth-placed outsiders Lanciano. In the following season, however, Trapani were crowned champions (this time in group A) and finally promoted to Serie B for their first time ever. In 2015‚Äì16, with Serse Cosmi as their coach, they finished in 3rd place, losing to Pescara in the play off final. However, they started off the following season badly, sacking Cosmi on 30 November with the club in last place. The appointment of Alessandro Calori saw an improvement in form, and the ended the season in 19th place, sitting in the relegation play off spots. Unfortunately, 18th placed Ternana finished five points above the Granata, meaning the club were relegated to Serie C for the 2017‚Äì18 season. Trapani's first season back to the third tier, with Calori still in charge, saw the Granata ending in third place (behind U.S. Lecce and Catania) and then eliminated at the playoff stage by eventual winners Cosenza. During the summer of 2018, Trapani's ownership announced their intention to sell the club and reduce the budget due to financial and legal issues surrounding the parent company Ustica Lines. Vincenzo Italiano was hired as new head coach in place of Calori, with Raffaele Rubino as director of football, for the new season. The season also saw the club being sold from the Morace family to the FM Service company, owned by Maurizio De Simone. The club ended the season in second place, and had a successful campaign in the subsequent promotion playoffs, making it to the finals against Piacenza after defeating Catania in the semi-finals. On 5 June 2019, just a few days after the first leg of the playoff finals, the Trapani playing squad announced their intention to send their notice of default after the new ownership had repeatedly failed to pay their salaries. On 15 June 2019, Trapani defeated Piacenza 2‚Äì0 to win their second promotion to Serie B in the club's history. The very next day, Rome-based property developer Giorgio Heller (who was already linked to the club in the past) announced his acquisition of a majority 80% share of the club. The takeover was formally finalized on 21 June 2019, in time to allow the club to successfully register for the 2019‚Äì20 Serie B season. On 10 July 2019, Francesco Baldini was named the new coach of Trapani.https://www.mediagol.it/notizie/trapani-il-nuovo-tecnico-sara- francesco-baldini/ Rivalries Trapani's main rivals are Marsala 1912 and Mazara, respectively from the neighbouring cities of Marsala and Mazara del Vallo. A rivalry with Palermo also exists, but has rarely been contested: Palermo and Trapani briefly played together in Serie C1, and renewed their rivalry in the 2013‚Äì14 Serie B campaign.

He served two terms in the United States House of Representatives (1860-1864) and in 1864 introduced the first resolution in Congress proposing a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery in the United States. After returning to Chicago in 1866, he practiced law and wrote biographies of Abraham Lincoln and Benedict Arnold. Early life, education, and early career Born in Hartwick, New York, Arnold was the son of Sophia M. and Dr. George Washington Arnold, natives of Rhode Island who had migrated to New York after the Revolutionary War.James A. Rawley, \\"Isaac Newton Arnold, Lincoln's Friend and Biographer\\", Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association, winter 1998, accessed 5 June 2012 He attended common schools, followed by the Hartwick Seminary in 1831-1832. There he joined the Philophronean Society, who debated the issues of the day, including the abolition of slavery.\\"Isaac Newton Arnold\\", Paul F. Cooper, Jr. Archives, Hartwick College, accessed 6 June 2012 From 1832-1835, Arnold taught school in Otsego County. He studied law with Richard Cooper, and later with Judge E. B. Morehouse of Cooperstown. Admitted to the bar in 1835 at the age of 20, Arnold became a partner of Morehouse. Migration west Excited by other possibilities, in 1836 Arnold moved to Chicago, a small village developing as population migrated west after completion of the Erie Canal in New York, which connected Great Lakes shipping to the port of New York City. He became a law partner of Mahlon D. Ogden. When Chicago was incorporated the following year, in 1837 Ogden was elected mayor and Arnold city clerk. He left office to attend to his law practice, through which he got to know and befriend fellow Illinois lawyer Abraham Lincoln. In 1842, Arnold was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives as a Democrat and served three terms. He was a Democratic presidential elector in 1844. Inspired by the issue of abolishing slavery, Arnold was a delegate to the national Free Soil Convention in 1848. He left the Democrats to become an organizer of the Free Soil Party in Illinois. Arnold served one term in the state house from 1855-56 under the Free Soil banner. In 1860 he joined the Republican Party and won election to the U.S. House that year. He was reelected in 1862. A strong supporter of President Lincoln during his tenure in Congress, Arnold pushed emancipation in the territories and nation. He defended Lincoln against critics, including within his party. In March 1862, during the American Civil War, Arnold introduced a bill to abolish slavery in U.S. territories, which became law in June 1862. In February 1864, he introduced a resolution for a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery throughout the United States, saying: He was the first Congressman to introduce a resolution to abolish slavery. In 1865 the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified and slavery was ended. In 1864 Arnold faced a strong challenge from the Democrat John L. Scripps, the postmaster in Chicago, whose appointment he had opposed. By then, Scripps controlled a large field of patronage because of his position. In addition, German Americans made up 25 percent of Arnold's constituents in 1860, and they were unhappy with him about continued drafts of men into the Army. Arnold withdrew from the race in favor of the Republican John Wentworth, the popular former mayor. Wentworth won the seat. Arnold accepted a presidential appointment from Lincoln as the Sixth Auditor of the Treasury Department.\\"Isaac Newton Arnold\\", Congressional Biographies In 1866, Arnold left Washington and returned to his law practice in Chicago. Literary career Arnold was rapidly working on a book about Lincoln. He published The History of Abraham Lincoln and the Overthrow of Slavery in 1867. This was considered a general history that suffered from not having sufficient research. He did years of research on an earlier historical figure, writing a biography entitled The Life of Benedict Arnold: His Patriotism and His Treason (1880). Dismayed by contemporary accounts of Lincoln by William H. Herndon and Ward Hill Lamon, Arnold wrote a new biography, The Life of Lincoln (1884), to concentrate on the years of his presidency and refute some of the personal controversial accounts. It was well received at the time, reviewed by the press in the US and Great Britain and, in the late 1940s, it was described as \\"one of the best of the early biographies.\\" It was reprinted in 1994. Arnold died April 24, 1884 and was buried at Graceland Cemetery in Chicago.

A farmer's daughter, Bowers married as a teenager, and her husband converted to Mormonism before the couple immigrated to the United States. After briefly living in Nauvoo, Illinois, she became an early Nevada pioneer, farmer and miner, and was made a millionaire by the Comstock Lode mining boom. Married and divorced two times, she married a third time and became a mother of three children but outlived them all.

Expensive toys and fancy dolls filled Persia's playroom. The extra upstairs room housed a hand- sculptured billiard table used for the enjoyment and entertainment of their guests. Kerosene lanterns and candles lighted the beautiful mansion that was truly unlike any other in the West.Buzick, Tamera, Bowers Mansion Remembered 1862, p. 10 Economic hardship The rich silver of the Comstock Lode began to play out in 1863 resulting in a deepening depression throughout 1864.History of the Comstock Lode 1850-1920 Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology, University of Nevada Sandy moved back to Gold Hill to help save the mine. With health failing, he attempted to sell or lease most of the Bowers mining operation in the spring of 1868. At the age of 35, Sandy died of Lung Disease on April 21, 1868 at his Gold Hill residence. He was buried on the hill behind his Mansion.Gold Hill Evening News, April 21, 1868 (3:2) The Bowers Mansion in 1940 In 1873, Virginia City recovered with a new strike bringing wealth back to the region. Eilley Bowers opened the Bowers Mansion to the public as a resort. The grounds were advertised as being beneficial to health, while dances and social events were held in the mansion. Bowers improved the mansion and grounds by adding a dance hall and offering the upstairs suits for family use. With the extension of the railroad which now connected Virginia City to the young town of Reno and the Trans Continental Railroad, Bowers Mansion became a prime destination for grand excursions. Eilley spent many weekends hosting extravagant picnics. The guests bathed in the fishponds, swung under the trees, waltzed on the dance floor and generally just had a fine old time. For the next few years, Bowers Mansion was filled with music and laughter. Meanwhile, Persia Bowers was sent to live with friends in Reno allowing her to go to school and learn music. On July 14, 1874 Persia died of what may have been a ruptured appendix.Carson Daily Appeal July 16, 1874 (2:2) She was buried behind the mansion with her father. The resort brought in some money, but Bowers was still in debt. The Bowers Mine was sold to pay off creditors, and she entered into negotiations with the newly created State of Nevada for the state to purchase the mansion as a psychiatric hospital.Cleere, p. 10 Unfortunately for Bowers, the deal fell through, and she was obliged to begin to sell her possessions to settle debts. Margaret Persia Bowers c. 1872 Bowers made one final attempt to save the mansion when she hired construction crews and began renovating the mansion. This time she changed the entire structure by adding a third floor. The $8,000 expansion included 14 rooms including 10 over the main house and two over each wing. However, this only increased her debt. In April 1876, the District Court of Washoe County finally ruled against Bowers and in favor of her creditors in the sum of $13,622.17.Nevada State Journal April 9, 1876 (3:2)On May 3, 1876, at 1:00 p.m. the courts auctioned off the remaindered of her properties in front of the Washoe county Courthouse. Eight years after Sandy's death, Eilley lost everything to the founder of Reno, Myron C. Lake for $10,000.Nevada State Journal May 4, 1876 (3:1) Seeress of Washoe Bankrupt and with no remaining family in the United States, Bowers set herself up as a fortune- teller using her peep stone, billing herself as \\"Mrs L. S. Bowers, The Famous Washoe Seeress\\".Smith, p. 96 She enjoyed some success with her predictions, successfully predicting, among other things, the fire which destroyed much of Virginia City in 1875. Due to the continued economic decline in northern Nevada following the collapse of the mining industry, in the 1880s she moved to San Francisco, where she continued to practice as a scryer.Cleere, p. 12 Destitution In the late 19th century, Bowers returned to Nevada. Her hearing had diminished significantly, and she was forced to give up the scrying business as she was unable to hear the requests of her clients. She launched a claim against the government asking for financial assistance in return for the $14,000 she and Sandy Bowers had donated to support the Union cause in the Civil War and to finance the 1860 Paiute War, but was ignored. Destitute, she was placed in the Washoe County poorhouse, and became the subject of a protracted legal dispute between the governments of Nevada and California over who was to pay for her care. In August 1901 it was agreed that California would take responsibility for her welfare, and she was summarily put on a San Francisco-bound train by Reno officials with $30 cash. For the last two years of her life she lived at the King's Daughters Home in Oakland, dying on October 27, 1903. Her ashes were returned to Nevada and buried alongside Sandy and Margaret at the Bowers Mansion.Cleere, p. 13 Legacy Eilley Bowers continues to be one of the most famous of 19th-century female pioneers, and a major figure in the early history of Nevada. In one writer's words, she \\"is one of the most researched, written and talked about women in Nevada history.\\" Following its sale at auction following foreclosure, the Bowers Mansion was abandoned. Eventually purchased by Reno saloon owner Henry Riter, it was renovated and reopened as a resort in 1903.Myrick, p. 159 The hot springs were remodeled to feed warm swimming pools, and a spur was built from the Virginia and Truckee Railroad to serve the property. It continued to operate as a resort until 1946. It is now considered the finest example of the mansion houses built by the millionaire beneficiaries of the Comstock boom, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is administered by the Washoe County Parks Department.

Two Great Stars - George Jones and Gene Pitney is an album by American country music artist George Jones and rock and roll artist Gene Pitney. It was released in 1965 on the Musicor label in the United States and on the Stateside label in the United Kingdom. Background After Jones left United Artists to join Musicor in 1965, it was decided that he start off with a duet recording session with teen idol Gene Pitney, and this release was motivated more by the fact that Pitney was also signed to Musicor rather than any musical compatibility. However, Pitney manages to hold his own with Jones and the album became a hit, rising to number three on the country album chart. The album was Pitney's eleventh for Musicor, and the pair would record one more duet album together called It's Country Time Again in 1966. The Bear Family record label would reissue both albums under the title George Jones & Gene Pitney, collecting 31 sides that the pair recorded together.

One-dimensional patterns may appear when superimposing an opaque layer containing tiny horizontal transparent lines on top of a layer containing a complex shape which is periodically repeating along the vertical axis. Description Shape moir√© is sometimes referred as band moir√©. The opaque layer with transparent lines is called the revealing layer. The layer containing the periodically repeating shapes is called the base layer. The period of shapes in the base layer is denoted as pb. The period of transparent lines in the revealing layer is denoted as pr. The periods of both layers must be sufficiently close. The superimposition image reveals the shapes of the base layer stretched along the vertical axis. The magnified shapes appear periodically along the vertical axis. The dimensions along the horizontal axis are not changed. If the complex shape of the base layer is a sequence of symbols (e.g. a horizontal text) compressed along the vertical axis, then the superimposition of the revealing layer can restore the original proportions of these symbols. The size along the vertical axis, pm, of the magnified optical shape is expressed by the following formula: :p_m=-\\\\frac{p_b \\\\cdot p_r}{p_b- p_r} Negative values of pm signify mirrored appearance (the magnified shapes will be inverted along the vertical axis) of the stretched shapes. When the revealing layer is moved along the vertical axis, the magnified shapes move along the vertical axis at a faster speed. The speedup factor is expressed by the following formula: :\\\\frac{v_m}{v_r}=-\\\\frac{p_b}{p_b-p_r} Negative values of vm / vr signify the movement of optical shapes in reverse direction. Examples When pr > pb, the magnified shapes appear normally, but they move in reverse direction compared to the movement of the revealing layer. See the figure below: Image:070320-a6-shape-moire-pr-gt-pb.gif When pr < pb, the magnified shapes appear inverted along the vertical axis, but they move in the same direction as the revealing layer.

A large signal model, on the other hand, takes into account the fact that the large signal actually affects the operating point, as well as that elements are non-linear and circuits can be limited by power supply values to avoid variation in operating point.

Thomas was the cousin of former NFL safety Terrence Kiel. Early life and education Born in Trinity, Texas, on March 30, 1973, Thomas attended Groveton High School in Groveton, Texas. He enjoyed a record-breaking career at Groveton, leading the Indians to two Class 2A state titles, while gaining 8,441 yards (third best in national high school history at the time, currently third best in state historyTexas High School Football Rushing Career Yardage Leaders Lone Star Gridiron behind Ken Hall and Wes Danaher) and scoring 115 touchdowns. As a senior at Groveton, Thomas rushed for an incredible 3,701 yards (second best in state history).Texas High School Football Rushing Season Yardage Leaders Lone Star Gridiron He was the first Texas running back to rush for 100 yards in all 16 games (the most a Texas high school can play during the season), accomplished in 1990. The highly recruited Thomas chose to attend Texas A&M; after high school. He rushed for almost 300 yards as a freshman and then compiled very consistent rushing totals his final 3 years in College Station: 856, 996, and 868 yards and became only the fourth Aggie to rush from more than 3,000 career yards. He was a two-time, consensus All-Southwest Conference selection and his 45 career touchdowns tied Darren Lewis for the most in Texas A&M; history. During Thomas' career at A&M;, the Aggies led the Southwest Conference in rushing four consecutive seasons as Thomas formed a powerful combination with future NFL backs Greg Hill and Leeland McElroy. Thomas' teams also established school records for most points in a season twice and never lost a game at Kyle Field and never lost to a conference opponent (28‚Äì0‚Äì1). He is Texas A&M;'s 4th all-time leading rusher and is 2nd all-time in rushing touchdowns. Thomas is remembered by many Aggie fans as much for what he did off the field as for what he did on it. He was an active member of service organization Aggie Athletes Involved, and was awarded the Southwest Conference American Airlines Spirit Award. He was honored by his teammates as the 1994 winner of the Aggie Heart Award, the highest honor for a Texas A&M; senior football player. The Heart Award is presented to a senior who has completed his eligibility and displays the following intangibles: effort, desire, determination, competitiveness, leadership, and courage. The award is voted upon by the entire team. Thomas was also well known by fellow students for an incident in Cain Hall, the then athletic dormitory at Texas A&M.; When a malfunction in a soft drink machine resulted in cans being dispensed without change being inserted into the machine, Thomas decided to intervene. Although he came from relatively modest means, he took his own change and reimbursed the machine for all of the drinks that had been taken. NFL Thomas was selected by the Houston Oilers in the third round (89th pick overall) of the 1995 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he was one of only 19 players in the AFC to finish with 1,000 or more combined yards from scrimmage (1,151 total ‚Äì 947 rushing and 204 receiving). Thomas' rushing total was, at the time, second only to Earl Campbell in Oiler historical top rookie rushing totals. In spite of his stellar rookie campaign, Thomas was relegated to backup and special teams roles the following season when the Oilers selected 1995 Heisman Trophy winner Eddie George as their No. 1 pick in the draft. In 1996, Thomas carried just 49 times for 151 yards. And in 1997, he gained 310 rushing yards on 67 carries. In 1998 his total continued to decline (just 24 carries for 100 yards) as George became a star in the league, leaving little playing time for Thomas. In spite of this, Thomas continued to be a team player, thriving in his role and never showing public displeasure, staying with the Oilers as they moved to Tennessee and turning down offers from other teams that would have been more lucrative and where he could have come out of George's shadow. He spent two more seasons with the Tennessee Titans, playing a backup role on the field, but providing leadership both on and off the field with his unparalleled work ethic and outstanding character. In 1999, the Titans made it to Super Bowl XXXIV in which Thomas appeared as a substitute, however they lost to the Kurt Warner-led St. Louis Rams. He signed as a free agent with the Atlanta Falcons in 2001. He played in 12 games for the Falcons that year, and finished with 37 carries for 126 yards and caught two passes for 26 yards. For his career, Thomas played in 103 games and rushed 532 times for 1,973 yards and 12 touchdowns. Thomas was waived by the Falcons before the 2002 preseason and subsequently retired from football.

He is the 5th generation inheritor of his family art. Garimot Arnis is a system composed of three basic parts: arnis de mano (weapons), buno (wrestling), and hilot (healing). The defining characteristic of the system is in keeping yourself safe. This is done by meticulously studying the footwork, angles, and distancing of largo mano (long hand) to keep yourself out of your opponent's range while keeping him in your range. In corto (close) range, the opponent's ability to attack must be shut down as quickly as possible, through a disarm, lock, or manipulation of the opponent's body, which sets up the finish. Above all, knowledge of hilot allows you to keep yourself healthy by helping to fight illness and injuries, especially injuries caused during arnis and buno training. \\"Garimot\\" (from Paeteno slang \\"garaymot,\\" meaning \\"absorber\\") was the fighting nickname of Gat Puno's father Felipe. Gat Puno took the name in his father's honor, and used it to name his family's system. Garimot Arnis consists of many styles, including: * Cinco Teros ‚Äì a style popular in Luzon, characterized by its use of five angles. Garimot Cinco Teros introduces the student to the basic theories of largo mano and corto, and was added to Garimot Arnis by Grandmaster Jose \\"Uti\\" Baet (3rd generation). * Tres Puntos ‚Äì a knife-fighting style from Batangas, the home of the balisong, characterized by its emphasis on thrusting and its use of three points. Garimot Tres Puntos uses the balisong and sling blade (developed by Grandmaster Felipe \\"Garimot\\" Baet), as well as common daggers and knives. It has been in the Garimot system since Grandmaster Lino \\"Bisaya\\" Baet (2nd generation). * Siete Colores ‚Äì a popular style in Laguna, characterized by its use of seven angles. Garimot Siete Colores is introduced after a student has become an expert in Cinco Teros, and teaches new theories of largo mano and corto, and includes the Laban Tulisan (Bandit Fighting) used by guerrilla warriors in Laguna. Though Laban Tulisan was introduced by Grandmaster Jose \\"Uti\\" Baet, Siete Colores has always been a part of the Baet family style. * Doce Pares ‚Äì this style is from Laguna, and not to be confused with the Doce Pares of Cebu. It is introduced after proficiency in Siete Colores, and provides further training in the classical arnis of Laguna. Doce Pares has been in the Garimot system since Grandmaster Elias \\"Tata\\" Baet (1st generation). * Larong Moro-Moro ‚Äì a play which dramatizes the triumph of the Spanish Christians over the Muslim Moors, used by the Filipinos to preserve their fighting arts. Garimot Arnis preserves the 30 traditional sequences of the battle-dances in the moro-moro, and all students are required to learn them and the hidden application, with a variety of weapons and shields. Every member of the Garimot lineage has been a moro- moro player. * Doble Teros ‚Äì this is a style of double stick/sword fighting from Pampanga which includes the abaniko and sinawali methods. It is introduced early in Garimot Arnis Training. * Sikadtukan ‚Äì Filipino kickboxing, that nevertheless includes a few throws and locks. * Buno ‚Äì a composite of native wrestling styles of the Philippines. It contains standing (clinch) work and groundfighting, including throws, locks, and chokes. Animal characteristics are emulated, but the two primary animals are the tiger and monkey, which represent the dichotomies of aggressive/passive, direct/evasive, hard/soft, etc. Grandmaster Jose \\"Uti\\" Baet was an accomplished wrestler, studied with Aetas, and taught Grandmaster Felipe \\"Garimot\\" Baet (4th generation), who in turn studied with the Mangyans. * Lubid ‚Äì part of the weaponry of Garimot Buno is the lubid (rope), though the principles apply to any flexible item, such as a belt, sarong, scarf or bandana. Garimot lubid training involves study of ways of holding, drawing, and striking with the weapon, as well as disarming, locking, choking, and tying the opponent. * Hilot ‚Äì native healing techniques of the Philippines, which include massage, herbs (internal and external use), oils, vinegar, water, and 'cupping.' Every member of the Garimot lineage has been a skilled hilot.Garimot ‚Äì St. Louis Accessed February 13, 2008  See also  * Arnis * Buno * Filipino Martial Arts  References  ;Notes ;Bibliography * Abundio S.

This was Jones's first album with the Musicor label after leaving United Artists in 1965. As Bob Allen points out in his book George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend, \\"During the next six years, with Musicor, George recorded more than over 280 songs - most of which were done in rushed, sloppily produced sessions - and help to establish for himself a somewhat unwelcome reputation as one of country music's most overrecorded artists.\\" Jones work with Musicor would also be increasingly characterized by the Nashville Sound that became prominent on country radio throughout the rest of the decade. Jones had recorded two duet albums with Montgomery on United Artists: 1963's What's In Our Hearts and 1964's Bluegrass Hootenanny. More curiously, Jones would record a duet album with rock and roll singer Gene Pitney in 1965 called For the First Time! Two Great Stars - George Jones and Gene Pitney.

Eli Yossef grew up in London and attended the Hasmonean High School where he established Betar England in 1973. In 1975, Yossef emigrated to Israel and served in the Golani and Paratroopers brigades of the Israel Defense Forces. After completing his military service, Yossef studied at Machon Meir and Hebrew University. In 1988, Yossef founded a Youth Aliyah (Aliyat haNoar) high school for new immigrants from France. In 1997, he organized a military preparatory program for Jewish students from abroad interested in volunteering in Israel's army. One of his major causes is freeing Jonathan Pollard.Special Pollard Session Next Week - Inside Israel - Israel News - Arutz Sheva In January 2000, Yossef conducted a hunger strike on Pollard's behalf outside of Israel's Parliament. He argued that anyone who passes classified information to the State of Israel regarding enemy intentions to harm Israel is morally innocent even if technically guilty by American law.Agenda-English In 2002 Yossef traveled to numerous Israeli high- schools and spoke of Pollard's plight as a moral national issue. Yossef's efforts to free Pollard has led him to collaborate with former Prisoners of Zion Natan Sharansky and Rabbi Yosef Mendelevitch over the years, highlighting the similarities between their situations in the Soviet Union and Pollard's in the United States.Eli Joseph to Speak on Pollard at Manhigut Yehudit ConferenceMendelovitch and Joseph Arrested Last Night; Another Pollard Demo Today Yossef has urged the Israeli government to establish what happened to Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved countless Jews from the Holocaust during World War II but was arrested following the war by Soviet agents and disappeared.For Pollard: Classes, Prayers, Visits and Hunger Strike - Jewish World - Israel News - Arutz Sheva Following the violent confrontation at Amona between the Israeli police and settler teenagers in early 2006, Yossef led Mehi activists on a three-week hunger strike vigil protesting violence between Jews.

He has worked on electoral campaigns for Republican candidates including Bob Dole, George W. Bush, Jeb Bush, and Mitt Romney. In 2008, Castellanos, a partner at National Media Inc., co-founded Purple Strategies, a bipartisan communications firm. Castellanos is also a regular guest commentator on Meet the Press and a contributor for CNN. Early life and education Alex Castellanos was born in Havana, Cuba in 1954 and immigrated to the United States in 1960 or 1961 with his family. He lived in North Carolina and attended the University of North Carolina, where he was a National Merit Scholar and a philosophy major. Castellanos is married and has two children. Career Castellanos has worked as a political consultant for Republican candidates for state and federal elections since the 1980s, including six presidential elections. In particular, he has received media attention for his work developing ads for political campaigns and is sometimes referred to as \\"the father of the attack ad\\". 1980s and 1990s: Early political work Castellanos began his career working on the successful 1984 re-election campaigns for United States Senators Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond. While working on these campaigns Castellanos met Mike Murphy, with whom he later formed the firm Murphy & Castellanos. Their firm worked on Bob Dole's 1988 presidential campaign. In 1989, Castellanos became a partner at National Media, Inc. In 1990, Castellanos again worked on the re-election campaign for Jesse Helms. During the campaign, Castellanos drew media attention for an ad he created that showed the hands of a white man holding a rejection letter because he had lost a job to a minority worker. The ad, known as \\"Hands\\", was criticized by supporters of Helms' opponent, Harvey Gantt for appealing to racial biases of white voters. Castellanos later explained that the intended message behind the ad was that \\"nobody should get a job, or be denied a job because of the color of their skin.\\" Also in 1990, Castellanos created television commercials for Bob Martinez's re-election campaign for governor of Florida. Throughout the 1990s, Castellanos worked on a variety of Republican campaigns as a media consultant and strategist. These included George H. W. Bush's 1992 presidential election campaign, Jeb Bush's 1994 campaign for governor of Florida, and Guy Millner's 1994 campaign for governor of Georgia. Castellanos again worked for Bob Dole on his 1996 presidential election campaign. It was during this campaign that Castellanos discussed the importance of \\"soccer moms\\" as a political demographic with The Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne. The phrase went on to become one of the key buzzwords of the election year. Castellanos worked on Jesse Helms' re-election campaign in 1996; Helms pulled controversial ads against Charlie Sanders and Harvey Gantt in April 1996, and Castellanos left the campaign at that time. He worked for Bob Taft's 1998 campaign for governor of Ohio. 2000s: Bush- Cheney and Romney campaigns Castellanos served as a media advisor to George W. Bush in both his 2000 and 2004 presidential election campaigns. During the campaigns, \\"he sealed his reputation as one of the keenest, most cutthroat strategists in the business.\\" While working on the 2000 campaign, Castellanos created an ad about the Medicare prescription plan Al Gore proposed in which the word \\"RATS\\" flashed briefly on the screen as the word \\"bureaucrats\\" appeared. This was discussed in the media as potential \\"subliminal messaging\\". In 2007 Castellanos was named to GQ Magazine's list of the \\"50 Most Influential People in D.C.\\" The following year, Castellanos worked for Mitt Romney's 2008 presidential campaign as part of the firm Midnight Ride Media, which managed advertising, production and media buying for the campaign. 2008 to present: Purple Strategies In 2008, the communications firm Purple Strategies was founded by Castellanos and Democrat Steve McMahon. According to Purple Strategies' managing partner Bruce Haynes, Castellanos and McMahon would routinely see each other while pitching to clients. The two ultimately decided to merge their \\"blue\\" and \\"red\\" consultancies to create a \\"purple\\" company. Castellanos is currently a principal partner at Purple Strategies, major clients of the bipartisan firm have included the United States Chamber of Commerce, BP and PhRMA. Other activities Castellanos is a guest commentator and contributor for CNN and has appeared on Meet the Press where he argued with Rachel Maddow in April 2012 about the existence of a gender gap in pay. Additionally, Castellanos writes online commentary for The Huffington Post and National Review, and is also a public speaker and member of the Washington Speakers Bureau. In 2008, Castellanos was a resident fellow at Harvard University's Institute of Politics. The following year, Castellanos became a senior communications advisor to Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele. In 2013, Castellanos shaved his mustache on The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer after promising to do so if 500 new donors would give to Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy. Also in 2013, Castellanos led a Super PAC project called NewRepublican.org, which is focused on broadening the Republican Party's demographic base. Along with other Republican political consultants, Castellanos signed a \\"friend of the court\\" brief in support of gay marriage in February 2013.

The shocks had magnitudes of 5.9 and 5.8 respectively. Most of the victims were killed and injured when a school collapsed in the town of San Giuliano di Puglia: 26 of the 51 schoolchildren died, together with one of their teachers. In particular, none of the nine children in the school's 4th Year (mostly born in 1996) survived. Tectonic setting Molise and Apulia lie above a series of thrust sheets that were emplaced northeastwards on top of the foreland of the Adriatic Plate due to continental collision during the Neogene. In the southern part of the Apennines, the thrusting is no longer active, but it continues in northern Italy along the southern margin of the Po Plain. The foreland to the east is characterised by zones of active west‚Äìeast trending dextral (right-lateral) strike-slip faulting. The best described of these zones is the Mattinata Fault, which has a clear topographic expression on the south side of the Gargano Peninsula and has been traced offshore into the Adriatic Sea. The estimated epicentre of the 1627 Gargano earthquake lies just beyond the western end of the known extent of the Mattinata Fault, although the link between the two remains uncertain. The Molise and Apulia regions are areas of low historical seismicity and relatively few earthquake records are available from the instrumental era. Damage=First shock During the night of 30‚Äì31 October there had already been three minor foreshocks, with the strongest at 03:27 (a magnitude of 3.5 on the Richter Scale, IV‚ÄìV on the Mercalli intensity scale). The strongest tremor took place at 11:32 on 31 October 2002 in the area of lower Molise, which is situated in the north-east of the Province of Campobasso. It reached from the Frentani Mountains to the Fortore valley. It lasted for 60 seconds and could be felt distinctly in the centre of Molise, in the Capitanata, the Province of Chieti, and could be felt in Marche, Bari, Benevento, Matera, Brindisi, Rome, Naples, Potenza, Salerno, Taranto and Pescara. San Giuliano di Puglia was near the epicentre (located between Campobasso, Larino and the Apennine Dauno). Due to the quake part of the roof of the school building \\"Francesco Jovine\\" collapsed. The school included a kindergarten, a primary school and a middle school. The roof landed on the lower part of the school. There were 57 children, 8 teachers and 2 caretakers trapped under the rubble.

It comprised two wooden platforms, accessed by a footbridge and stairs, and a brick building. St Ann's Road station on a 1920 map The service at the station was generally between St Pancras or Kentish Town and Barking or Southend, however at times trains ran to some other destinations including Cambridge, Chingford and Victoria.

He was of mixed race (one-quarter African and three- quarters European) and was listed in the census as white. Elected as town constable in 1768, he was elected to other positions, serving in local government every year but one until his death. Cheswell is considered by George Mason University to be the first African American elected to public office in the history of the United States. (see also: African-American officeholders in the United States, 1789‚Äì1866) Around the time of his marriage, Wentworth purchased a plot of land from his father Hopestill. His grandfather Richard is believed to be the first African American in New Hampshire to own land. A deed shows that Richard purchased from the Hilton grant in 1717. In 1801, Wentworth was among the founders of the first library in the town and provided in his will for public access to his personal library. New Hampshire historical marker outside Cheswell burial plot in Newmarket, NH Early life and education Wentworth was the only child born in Newmarket, New Hampshire, to Hopestill Cheswell, a free black man of biracial ancestry, and his wife, Katherine (Keniston) Cheswell, a white woman. The senior Cheswell was a master housewright and carpenter who worked mostly in the thriving city of Portsmouth. Among other projects, Cheswell helped to build the Bell Tavern in 1743 on Congress Street and the John Paul Jones House, originally owned by Captain Gregory Purcell and now a designated National Historic Landmark. The Jones house was an example of classic mid- eighteenth century elite housing.Mark J. Sammons and Valerie Cunningham, Black Portsmouth: Three Centuries of African-American Heritage, (2004), pp. 32-33, accessed 27 July 2009 The Jones House for years served (and continues to) as the Portsmouth Historical Society Museum. Cheswell also built the Samuel Langdon House, which was moved to Sturbridge Village; it is a central exhibit demonstrating 18th-century construction technology. Hopestill Cheswell was born free to a white mother and Richard Cheswell, an indentured black laborer in Exeter, New Hampshire, who was the first Cheswell recorded in New England. (Because his mother was free, the boy was free, according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, by which children followed the mother's status, which was incorporated into slave law in the colonies.) After completing his servitude, Richard Cheswell purchased of land from the Hilton Grant. The deed, dated 18 October 1717, is the earliest known deed showing land ownership by a black man in present-day New Hampshire. The land was located in what was to become the town of Newmarket. Hopestill was the only known child of this union. Hopestill Cheswell earned enough as a housewright to purchase a total of more than of land between 1773 and 1749, which he farmed while working as a housewright. Later, he had part ownership of a sawmill and stream in Durham, New Hampshire, as well as \\"mill privilege\\" at another falls, to handle his need for lumber. His prosperity helped provide for his son's education. He sent his son Wentworth to Governor Dummer Academy in Byfield, Massachusetts. There the youth studied with the Harvard graduate William Moody, who taught the classical subjects of Latin and Greek, reading, writing, and arithmetic, as well as swimming and horsemanship. As Erik Tuveson noted in his master's thesis on the first three generations of Cheswells, the youth's education was: > an unusual privilege for a country boy of that time. Few people of the > colonial era were formally educated, mostly due to cost and lack of > inexpensive public schooling. Education of any formal sort in colonial New > England carried a significant degree of elite social status.Mario de Valdes > y Cocom, \\"Cheswell\\", The Blurred Racial Lines of Famous Families, PBS > Frontline, 1996 Early career After completing his education, Wentworth Cheswill returned to Newmarket to become a schoolmaster. In 1765, he purchased his first parcel of land from his father. By early 1767, he was an established landowner with more than and held a pew in the meetinghouse. By 1770, he owned . Cheswill was first elected to public office in 1768 as the town constable, and later was elected to local offices every year (except for 1788) until his death in 1817, to positions such as town selectman, auditor, assessor, and others.Rachel Grace Toussaint, \\"Legacy of Newmarket founding father revealed\\", seacoastonline.com, 22 December 2002, hosted at Newmarket, New Hampshire Historical Society In 2008, George Mason University in Virginia declared Wentworth Cheswill to be the first African American elected to public office in the history of the United States. He preceded Alexander Twilight of Vermont (1836), Joseph Hayne Rainey of South Carolina (1870), and John Mercer Langston of Virginia (1888) for the title. Marriage and family Cheswill married 17-year-old Mary Davis of Durham on 13 September 1767. Eleven months later, the first of their 13 children was born.Rev. Steve Williams, \\"Wentworth Cheswell\\", America's Founding Fathers website, 2009 Their children were: Paul (1768), Thomas (1770), Samuel (1772), Sarah (1774), Mary (1775), Elizabeth (1778), Nancy (1780), Mehitable (1782), William (1785), a daughter (name unknown) (1785), Martha (1788), a daughter (name unknown) (1792), and Abigail (1792). Son Thomas Cheswill attended Phillips Exeter Academy and later became a deacon. Thomas' wife and children remained in Newmarket, and are buried in Riverside Cemetery. Revolutionary War During the American Revolutionary War, the citizens of Newmarket, including Cheswill, were unequivocally for the patriotic cause. In April 1776, along with 162 other Newmarket men, Cheswill signed the Association Test. Patriots collected signatures of people opposed to what they considered the hostile actions by the British fleets and armies. The abundance of the returns gave the signers of the Declaration of Independence assurance that their acts would be sanctioned and upheld by most of the colonists. He was elected town messenger for the Committee of Safety, which entrusted him to carry news to and from the Provincial Committee at Exeter. On 13 December 1774, Paul Revere was dispatched to Portsmouth to warn the town that the British warships, frigate and the sloop of war Canseau, were on their way to reinforce Fort William and Mary (known as \\"The Castle\\") and seize its powder and arms. When Portsmouth asked for help from neighboring communities, Newmarket held a town meeting to decide on their response. Townsmen voted to send 30 armed men to Portsmouth. Cheswill rode to Exeter to receive instructions from the Provincial committee on where the men were to be sent. He was also with the party which built rafts to defend Portsmouth Harbor. On the morning of 14 December 1774, John Langdon made his way through Portsmouth with a drummer, collecting a crowd to descend on the fort. Several hundred men responded to his call, setting out for The Castle by way of the Piscataqua River. The colonists removed 100 barrels of gun powder, light cannons, and small arms. These captured supplies were later used by New Hampshire's forces against the British military, including at the Siege of Boston. As a private, Cheswill served under Langdon in a select company called \\"Langdon's Company of Light Horse Volunteers\\", which helped to bolster the Continental Army at the Saratoga campaign. Langdon's company of Light Horse Volunteers made the 250-mile march to Saratoga, New York, to join with the Continental Army under General Horatio Gates, defeating British General John Burgoyne at the Battle of Saratoga, which was the first major American victory in the Revolution. Cheswill's only military service ended 31 October 1777. As with many other men, he served for a limited time, as his family was dependent on him for support. Local leader After his service in the war, Cheswill returned to Newmarket and continued his work in town affairs. He also ran a store next to the school house. Cheswill supported his family as a teacher, and was elected and appointed to serve in local government for all but one year of the remainder of his life, as selectman, auditor, assessor, scrivener, and other roles. In 1778, Cheswill was elected to the convention to draft New Hampshire's first constitution, but he was unable to attend. He was interested in artifacts from the town and wrote about his studies; he has been called the first archeologist in New Hampshire for his work. The scholars W. Dennis Chesley and Mary B. Mcallister have said, \\"Cheswill's writings clearly contain the seeds of modern archaeological theory. His eighteenth century fieldwork and reports, limited though they were, justify calling him New Hampshire's first archaeologist.\\" Unfortunately The New Hampshire Archaeological Society has not taken the step to officially bestow the honor to him. W. Dennis Chesley and Mary B. Mcallister, \\"Pioneers in New Hampshire Archaeology: Wentworth Cheswell Esquire\\", The New Hampshire Archaeologist, Vol. 22 (1), 1981 In 1801, Cheswill and other men established the first library in Newmarket, the Newmarket Social Library. Of the estates of men who started the library, Cheswill's was valued the highest at over $13,000. In his will he stated, > I also order and direct that my Library and collection of Manuscripts be > kept safe and together‚Ä¶if any should desire the use of any of the books and > give caution to return the same again in reasonable time, they may be lent > out to them, provided that only one book be out of said Library in the hands > of any one at the same time. Cheswill was a self-appointed town historian. As scrivener, he copied many of the town records from 1727, including two regional Congregational Church meetings. He collected stories and took notes of town events as they occurred. Jeremy Belknap, who wrote a three-volume History of New Hampshire, quoted Cheswill more than once at length in his work, and credited him for his local histories. They corresponded several times. In 1805, Cheswill was elected as the Justice of the Peace for Rockingham County. In that position, he executed deeds, wills, and legal documents, and was a justice in the trial of causes. He served as Justice until typhus fever caused his death on 8 March 1817, a month before his 71st birthday. In his will, Cheswill requested that: > the burying place in the orchard near my dwelling house be fenced with > rocks, as I have laid out (if I should not live to finish it) and grave > stones be provided for the graves therein‚Ä¶.\\" His daughter Martha, as his last surviving heir, provided the following in her will: > the burying yard at my farm as now fenced in, for a burying place for all my > connections and their descendants forever‚Ä¶on the express condition that they > and their heirs and assigns shall forever maintain and support the fence > around said burying yard in as good condition as it now is. Legacy * In 1820, shortly after Cheswill died, the New Hampshire Senator David L. Morril used him as a positive example of the contributions of mixed- race persons in a speech to the United States Congress regarding the negative effects of discriminatory racial legislation. Morril opposed a bill to forbid mulatto persons to become citizens of Missouri. In his speech Morril noted, > \\"In New Hampshire there was a yellow man by the name of Cheswell [sic], who, > with his family, were respectable in points of abilities, property and > character. He held some of the first offices in the town in which he > resided, was appointed Justice of the Peace for that county, and was > perfectly competent to perform with ability all the duties of his various > offices in the most prompt, accurate, and acceptable manner.\\" Angrily, > Morril added, \\"But this family are forbidden to enter and live in > Missouri.\\"Mark J. Sammons and Valerie Cunningham, Black Portsmouth: Three > Centuries of African-American Heritage, (2004), p. 124, accessed 27 July > 2009 :Note: Cheswell was listed as white on the census, but Morril's reference suggests he was considered mulatto by some contemporaries. *Wentworth's grandfather Richard Cheswell, a former slave of African ancestry, is the first known resident by that surname in New England; all descendants share his African ancestry, as well as that of his English wife. PBS Frontline discussed the Cheswell family as among mixed-race American families in Blurred Racial Lines of Famous Families, associated with its program Secret Daughter (1996), based on June Cross' memoir. *In 2006, Cheswell descendants and other New England residents raised funds to restore or replicate the Cheswell gravestones. In addition, they and members of the New Hampshire Old Graveyard Association worked to clean up the old Cheswell gravesite.Peg Warner, \\"Graveyard to get TLC\\", seacoastonline.com, 28 April 2006, hosted at Newmarket, New Hampshire Historical Society Some Cheswell descendants, whose families have identified as white for many generations, discovered their connection to the Cheswells and African-American heritage due to publicity in 2002 and following years of research about Wentworth Cheswell done by Rich Alperin, a local resident. He also brought notice to an unpublished master's thesis by Erik R. Tuveson about the first three generations of Cheswells and other people of color in New Hampshire. It is available at the University of New Hampshire. *In 2007, a New Hampshire historical marker (number 209) highlighting Wentworth's accomplishments was erected at the Cheswell gravesite in Newmarket.

It may be made of ceramic, stone or, more recently, salt. Food is put on the stone, which is then placed in an oven, though sometimes the stone is heated first. Baking stones are used much like cookie sheets, but may absorb additional moisture for crispier food. A pizza stone is a baking stone designed for cooking pizza. Overview Due to the thermal mass of baking stones and the material's property as a poor heat conductor, food is less likely to burn when one uses a baking stone instead of metal or glass bakeware. Baking stones are a variation on hot stone cooking, which is one of the oldest cooking techniques known. Some cooks recommend sprinkling corn meal or flour on the baking stone to prevent the crust from sticking or using parchment paper atop the stone. Baking \\"stones\\" may be purchased as unglazed ceramic tiles, unglazed fired clay tiles and quarried tiles, from tile shops and hardware stores. To prevent fracturing of the stone by thermal shock, some bakers place the baking stone in a cold oven and heat it over at least 45 minutes, then allow it to cool slowly inside the oven after switching it off. Because of the possibility of rapid temperature change, baking stones should not be left in an oven while it is in self cleaning mode. Baking stones can be cleaned with a dry brush or scouring pad followed by plain hot water. Because it is porous, a baking stone will absorb any fluid it contacts, including detergent. Use of any detergents may taint the stone, imparting the flavor of detergent to foods later cooked on the stone.  Pizza stone When designed for cooking pizzas, a baking stone is often referred to as a pizza stone. Using a pizza stone more or less mimics the effects of cooking a pizza in a masonry oven. The porous nature of the stone is commonly believed to absorb moisture; resulting in a crispier crust. Small pizza stones can be purchased to fit any conventional cooking oven or an enclosed barbecue-style grill. High-end ovens sometimes offer optional pizza stones that are specifically designed for each oven model and may include a specialized heating element. In addition to traditional methods, a pizza stone can also be made out of metal.

The garrison, which originally held about 30 men, was built beginning in the autumn of 1700 under the direction of Pierre-Charles Le Sueur, a French trader and explorer interested in mining a blue clay that he thought was copper ore. It was named in honor of a metallurgical assayer, Remy-Fran√ßois L'Hullier. Le Sueur left the fort in 1701 to take samples to New Orleans for further analysis. While he was gone, however, the fort was apparently attacked and abandoned by 1702, and no more was heard of the remaining men. In addition, the blue clay was found to be worthless, not the copper ore Le Sueur had hoped. The fort was southwest of the present city of Mankato (from \\"mah kato: \\"blue earth\\" in the Sioux language). Its exact location is unknown, although attempts have been made to find it.

Only the prototype, registered G-AHSY, (c/n 2250) was built as the aircraft was not developed further. Another example G-AJIJ (c/n 2401) was not completed. The sole J/3 was dismantled at Rearsby in 1950 and was rebuilt to J/4 standard with a new registration G-AJYX and c/n 2941.

According to the message, \\"Jean Nepomucene Auguste Pichauld, Comte de Fortsas\\", had been a collector of unique books ‚Äî books of which only one copy was known to exist. When he had died, on September 1, 1839, he had possessed 52 such books. His heirs, not interested in collecting books, had decided to auction the collection. The auction was to be held on August 10, 1840. On the appointed date, numerous collectors and intellectuals gathered in Binche, hoping to bid on the books. They learned, however, that the offices of the notary where the auction was to take place did not exist ‚Äî nor did the street upon which the offices were supposedly located. Notices which had been posted around Binche claimed that there would be no auction after all, because the town's public library had acquired the books; however, those attempting to visit the library to view the collection discovered that Binche possessed no public library. Later it was discovered that there had never been a Comte de Fortsas. It was eventually revealed that the hoax had been planned and carried out by antiquarian and retired military officer Renier Hubert Ghislain Chalon, who enjoyed playing elaborate pranks on intellectuals. Ironically, the original catalogue of fictitious unique books Chalon had sent to his victims has itself become a sought-after collectors' item. It has since been reprinted several times.

Lewis Middle School, both located in Paso Robles, as well as from the Lillian Larsen School, a public K-8 school in San Miguel, California and Pleasant Valley Elementary School, a public K-8 school located in an outlying area of northeastern San Luis Obispo County. Additionally, the school receives students from private K-8 schools such as Trinity Lutheran School and St. Rose Catholic School, both located in Paso Robles. And some from Santa Lucia School located in Templeton, California http://www.greatschools.org/california/paso-robles/6802-Paso-Robles-High- School/ The school boasts strong vocational, agricultural, and college preparatory programs, as well as a limited number of honors and AP courses in the fields of history/social science (honors/AP), English language/literature (honors/AP), mathematics (AP) and science (AP). Foreign languages offered include Spanish, French, and American Sign Language. The school has also maintained the largest SkillsUSA organization in California for several years, and it is an AVID National Demonstration School. The first high school in San Luis Obispo County, Paso Robles High School was built in 1892 and graduated its first senior class in 1896. Constructed with locally made bricks, the stately three-story structure was located at 17th Street and Vine Street, where the Marie Bauer Elementary sits now. A decade upon opening, the high school and upper-level auditorium would languish in the aftermath of the San Francisco Earthquake in 1906. A new location was built at 24th and Spring Street, and the faulted building was later razed in 1939. In the 1960s, the 24th Street campus was refurbished, with subsequent additions to what later became Flamson Middle School. (By 2003, the San Simeon Earthquake rendered the structures unsalvageable, and a new middle school was constructed.) By 1980, the third PRHS campus was built on Niblick Road, where it stands today. However, football games continue at War Memorial Stadium on the Flamson Middle School campus to a faithful attendance of PRHS boosters. Most other competitive sporting events are held on the PRHS campus. Although the school's athletic facilities are somewhat limited, the campus plays host to an extensive agricultural education facility. The school's mascot is the bearcat. Sports Paso Robles High School is the northernmost high school in the western half of the CIF Southern Section. It plays in the PAC-8 League along with its nearest rival Atascadero High School.

The game was released after much delay in 1999 by Electronic Arts. The game set uses a first person perspective. Plot The story takes place some time after Guardians of Destiny, and is based on the adventures of Copper LeGr√©, the son of Eric and fourth in the line of succession, whose uncle Richard rules the Lands. In the beginning of the game, Copper's father and two half brothers are slain by a dreadful rift hound, and Copper's own soul is torn from his body. As a result, Copper must not only retrieve his soul, but also settle the allegations now leveled against him as he was the only survivor. As the new sole heir to the Kingdom of Gladstone, many believe he orchestrated the whole incident with his father and brothers. Coupled with that is the fact that he is the result of an illicit affair between his father and a Dracoid barmaid‚Äîa half-breed heir. He must not only deal with those issues but also seek out answers to help close new rifts that have appeared throughout the Lands. The story unfolds over many portal worlds in which Copper has to retrieve lost pieces of the Shining Path (which shattered when the Draracle left the Gladstone world). The same Draracle has sent Copper on his quest to save his life and soul as well as to save his home and world. Gameplay Set in a first person perspective, the game mechanics work as hack and slash when utilizing melee weapons. It uses many common elements of RPGs such as the guilds the player can join, having both weapons and magic attacks, and several portal worlds. There is an inventory screen, where the player can collect many weapons, armour and other items such as food. The leveling system works whereby using abilities enough will lead to levelling up in the guild that specialises in that particular ability, and higher levels unlock more skills. Guilds There are four guilds: a warriors' guild, a magicians' guild, a clerics' guild, and the illegal thieves' guild. Each one has its own set of quests to accomplish throughout the game, a familiar (a creature who accompanies and assists the player throughout the game), and a guild building containing shops, guild masters and sometimes training areas. The avatar, Copper, must join at least one, but has the option to join the others also. Reception Lands of Lore III received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews by critics.

Council on Chiropractic Education of Canada accredits educational programs. Canadian Federation of Chiropractic Regulatory and Educational Accrediting Boards The \\"Canadian Federation of Chiropractic Regulatory and Educational Accrediting Boards\\" (French La f√©d√©ration chiropratique canadienne des organismes de r√©glementation professionnelle et d'agr√©ment des programmes d'enseignement) is a Canadian national association of provincial and territorial chiropractic licensing authorities and accredited educational programs. In Canada, chiropractic is licensed at the provincial and territorial level; the federation provides a clearinghouse for these authorities to exchange information and resources.  Licensure  Canadian Chiropractic Examining Board requires all candidates to complete a 12-month clinical intership to obtain licensure, as well as write a total of 3 exams in their 4th year of study. Candidates must successfully pass Components A and B (Written Cognitive Skills Examination) to be eligible for the Clinical Skills Examination. Canadian accrediting standards are higher than the United States, and admission requirements into the Doctor of Chiropractic Degree programme are the strictest in North America.403 Forbidden Regulation & standards Chiropractic is regulated by provincial statute in all 10 Canadian provinces. Chiropractors have the legislated right to use the title doctor in all provincial jurisdictions . Some provincial jurisdictions, such as Manitoba, require that chiropractors also display or makes use of the word \\"Chiropractic\\" or the word \\"Chiropractor\\" immediately preceding or following the word doctor . Each province has a regulatory college established by legislation in the same manner, and with the same structure and similar regulations, as the regulatory bodies for other health care professions. The regulatory colleges are responsible for protecting the public, standards of practice, disciplinary issues, quality assurance and maintenance of competency.  Education  Chiropractic education in Canada is offered at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC) in Toronto, and at l'Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Trois-Rivi√®res (UQTR). Both programs are fully accredited by the Council on Chiropractic Education of Canada. Canadian Chiropractic students undergo a course of study similar to that of other doctoral-level health care professionals, including medicine, optometry and dentistry and have similar entrance requirements. Students are required to complete a minimum of three years of university before they are eligible for admission to the CMCC Doctor of Chiropractic Degree program and have a minimum of 7 years combined prior to graduation and licensure. The CMCC program requires four years of full-time study, including a 12-month internship in the College's internal and external clinics including St-Josephs Rehabilitation Hospital . In Quebec, the UQTR has a five-year program following graduation from C√âGEP. CMCC also offers chiropractic graduate studies in sport sciences, clinical sciences, rehabilitation sciences and radiology following the 4-year Doctor of Chiropractic Degree. A one-year continuing education programme in acupuncture is also offered. Multidisciplinary faculty In addition to the academic program, chiropractic education requires hands-on clinical experience under the supervision of highly qualified chiropractic faculty. This experience includes clinical assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and referral protocols. The faculty at both CMCC and UQTR have diverse backgrounds and offer students a wide range of expertise. Faculty come from such disciplines as biological sciences, pathology, medicine and psychology, as well as chiropractic. Both the CMCC and the UQTR programs include courses in anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, neurology, embryology, principles of chiropractic, radiology, immunology, microbiology, pathology, nutrition, and clinical sciences specifically relating to diagnosis with emphasis on the neuromusculoskeletal system. In particular, chiropractors receive training in radiology that covers a range of topics from radiation biophysics and protection to clinical X-ray interpretation and diagnosis. Radiology training consists of more than 360 contact hours followed by application during clinical internship. CMCC and UQTR have also developed relationships ‚Äì both formal and informal ‚Äì with other universities in Canada. For example, faculty and students of CMCC are currently conducting research with fellow scientists at the University of Alberta, University of Calgary, University of Saskatchewan, University of Toronto and Ryerson University. UQTR has collaborations with l'Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al and Laval University.What Is Chiropractic?  Hospital and public health integration  Deborah Kopansky-Giles, FCCS(C) the principal investigator for a large demonstration project at St. Michael's Hospital, Integrating Chiropractic Health Care in a Primary Care, Hospital-Based Setting, received a $600,000 grant from the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care in Ontario. The two-year project evaluated a new model of health service delivery where chiropractors are integrated as staff practitioners into a teaching hospital.Deborah Kopansky-Giles, FCCS(C), FICC The project was deemed a success and as of June 2007 Kopansky-Giles and Igor Steinman, FCCS(C) have both been given permanent funding and have been integrated into the primary care staff at the hospital. Furthermore, chiropractic doctors are now working on Family Health Teams and Community Health Centres as interdisciplinary models of care and an increased focus on wellness and preventative health evolve as the new paradigm.  Research: Academic integration =Consortium of University-Based Research Centres The Consortium of Canadian Chiropractic Research Centres (CCCRC), established in 1998 by the Canadian Chiropractic Association (The CCA) represents research collaborations with many universities and institutions across the country. The CCCRC currently comprises the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College and twelve university- based research sites where chiropractic researchers either hold faculty appointments or are taking advanced research training. The CCCRC facilitates inter-disciplinary research and has sponsored four significant research symposia since its inception. The CCRC, partnered with the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR) have successly developed the University Chiropractic Research Chairs where chiropractic scientists study manual medicine and public health measures.Chiropractic Research International collaboration The Canadian Chiropractic Association is an affiliate member of the Canadian Cochrane Network and Centre and a representative of the chiropractic profession serves on the Executive Committee of the Network. The Cochrane Collaboration, established in the United Kingdom in 1993, is an international organization whose mission is to prepare, maintain and promote the accessibility of systematic reviews of the effects of health care interventions. The CCA also participates in international projects such as the World Health Organization's Bone and Joint Decade Task Force on Neck Pain and Its Associated Disorders which is conducting multi-disciplinary, international studies. The Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College The Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC) has been recognized as an international leader in chiropractic research for more than five decades. Over the years, members of CMCC's faculty have developed collaborative research relationships with faculty at many academic institutions in North America. CMCC and the profession also participate in inter-professional health policy development. An example of this is the 2003 award of almost $2 million by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care to faculty at CMCC for a primary care project to develop a model of collaborative, inter-disciplinary practice. Researchers The profession's researchers are funded by many premier agencies such as the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Health Canada, Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Industry Canada, Alberta Provincial CIHR Training Program in Bone and Joint Health, and the Canada Primary Care Transition Fund, to name a few. The profession's researchers undertake broad-based, substantive research in biomedical and clinical sciences, health systems and services, and in social cultural areas, and they are widely published in both chiropractic and non-chiropractic peer-reviewed journals. Some of these journals include the New England Journal of Medicine, the Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine, Arthritis and Rheumatism, British Medical Journal, Canadian Medical Association Journal, Spine, Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, the Clinical Journal of Pain, the Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association and the Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics. Building a research culture One of the primary goals of the Canadian Chiropractic Research Foundation (CCRF) is to support chiropractors to obtain their Masters and PhD degrees and support their research projects. This is one of the ways in which the profession continually nurtures a chiropractic research culture that will inform the quality of care. The Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) has also partnered with the profession to fund doctoral and fellowship awards. The training of chiropractic researchers through sponsored PhD programs will enable the profession to further develop the research leadership to ensure continued research into chiropractic health care. A national community of full-time research scholars in chiropractic will ensure that Canadians benefit from high quality, evidence-based care. Chiropractic research agenda In 2000, the Canadian Chiropractic Association began a complex process to establish a national chiropractic research agenda in Canada. This process is funded in part by four CIHR Institutes: the Institute of Musculoskeletal Health and Arthritis, the Institute of Aging, the Institute of Neuroscience, Mental Health and Addiction, and the Institute of Population and Public Health. University chairs in chiropractic The Canadian Chiropractic Research Foundation has established a university Research Chair program, jointly funded with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), which currently funds Chiropractic research in 12 different public universities across Canada. Greg Kawchuk was the first member of the profession to be awarded a university- based Chiropractic Research Chair. He was subsequently awarded a Canada Research Chair at the University of Alberta, one of the federal government's highest research awards. Mark Erwin was awarded the profession's second Research Chair in 2003 at the University of Toronto where he is investigating degenerative disc disease, the most common cause of lower back pain and associated disability. Jean-S√©bastien Blouin has been named to the Canadian Chiropractic Research Foundation (CCRF) Professorship in Spine Biomechanics and Neurophysiology at the University of British Columbia (UBC). This five- year, full-time tenure tracked position for a DC begins with an initial investment of $500,000 and is funded by the CCRF, UBC, the British Columbia Chiropractic Association (BCCA) and the British Columbia College of Chiropractors (BCCC). Martin Descarreaux has been named to the Chiropractic Research Chair at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec a Trois Rivi√®res. The Fondation de Recherche Chiropratique du Qu√©bec and Platinum Systems, a firm specializing in clinical management software, are both contributing to finance the Chair. Descarreaux is a full-time professor at UQTR teaching clinical biomechanics. In collaboration with the Department of Kinesiology, he is currently studying the effect of muscular fatigue and pain on the control of head and neck movements. Descarreaux is also pursuing research on low back pain and is conducting a study on low back muscle fatigue and neuromuscular control of lumbar stability. The profession's Research Chair program will significantly build the profession's intellectual research capacity and help Canadians live healthier lives. In June 2007, Jill Hayden became the profession's newest Chiropractic Research Chair and will take up the CCRF/CIHR Chair at the Toronto Western Research Institute. She is currently a Scientist at the Centre for Research Expertise in Improved Disability Outcomes (CREIDO) at University Health Network Rehabilitation Solutions located at the Toronto Western Hospital. In addition, Hayden is a Scientific Associate in the Division of Health Care and Outcomes Research at the Toronto Western Research Institute. Hayden's research experience and expertise includes prognostic research, systematic review methods and musculoskeletal health, specifically low back pain. Her current work at CREIDO focuses on prognosis research and the development of prognostic models for disability outcomes in low back pain. Current university-based research chairs now include: Greg Kawchuk at the University of Alberta, Mark Erwin at the University of Toronto, Jean-S√©bastien Blouin at the University of British Columbia, Martin Descarreaux at Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Trois-Rivi√®res, and Jill Hayden at the Toronto Western Research Institute, University Health Network.Canadian Chiropractic Research Bulletin #12 ReferencesExternal links *Canadian Chiropractic Association *registrar.cmcc.ca Category:Chiropractic Category:Chiropractic organizations Category:Health Canada ","title":"Chiropractic in Canada"},{"id":"10168990","text":"Corey Lake is a small, inland lake in south western Michigan.

Based in Santa Monica, California, Electric Crayon mainly served the US comic book industry, providing digital color separations for many popular Marvel, DC, and Image titles, including Generation X, Astro City, and the one-shot Batman/Punisher crossover. Electric Crayon was notable for two reasons: Although Image Comics and other independent companies (such as Steve Oliff's Olyoptics) had pioneered digital color separations, they were typically focused on special projects or boutique publishers. Electric Crayon attempted to bring the greater detail and color fidelity available through digital separations to mainstream comics, typically known for coarsely screened hand separations. Electric Crayon was founded shortly after Richard Starking's Comicraft, and occupied the same office building for a time. This led to the creation of new efficiencies in the comic book production process, where the dialogue balloons containing the lettering were composed onto the finished color art. This allowed the lettering work to happen in parallel to the inking, rather than as a serial process, compressing the time necessary to produce a finished digital file for printing. Electric Crayon operated for slightly over a year as a comic book coloring company. Eventually, the mounting costs of archival hard disk storage and the slow computers of the time made it impractical for the company to scale without either selling to a larger company or raising rates beyond what the market would pay. at the Internet Archive, Mar 13, 2007.

Wellness policy Blue Mountain School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006 ‚Äì Policy 246.Blue Mountain School Board Policy Manual The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. According to the policy, the Superintendent shall annually report to the Board on the district's compliance with law and policies related to student wellness. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äî Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008 The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Blue Mountain School District offers both a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs ‚Äì Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that Districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non- subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013‚Äì2014 was $2.93. In 2015, federal reimbursement rates were: $3.07 per meal for students who are income-eligible for free lunches and $2.67 for those who qualify for a reduced price. School lunch participation nationally dropped from 31.6 million students in 2012 to 30.4 million in 2014, according to the federal Department of Agriculture. Pennsylvania statistics show school lunch participation dropped by 86,950 students in the same two years, from 1,127,444 in 2012 to 1,040,494 in 2014. In 2014, President Barack Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The US Department of Agriculture requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Blue Mountain School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. In 2016, the Pennsylvania Department of Health distributed to each Pennsylvania high school the overdose antidote drug naloxone in a nasal spray. School nurses were also provided with educational materials and training developed by the National Association of School Nurses. The cost was covered by a grant from a private foundation. The District participated in Highmark Healthy High 5 Health eTools for Schools which enabled mobile data collection of health and physical fitness screening data on students K-12 in a database held by InnerLink, Inc. in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Health eTools for Schools also provided interdisciplinary research-based curriculum in nutrition, physical education and physical activity to participating districts. The program was discontinued in 2013. Special education In December 2015, the District administration reported that 496 pupils or 18.9% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 56.7% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2012, Blue Mountain School District administration reported that 528 pupils or 18.2% of the District's pupils received Special Education services, with 56% of identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the district administration reported that 484 pupils or 16.1% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Supervisor of Special Education. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Blue Mountain School District received a $1,460,241 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013‚Äì14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010‚Äì11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The District must apply for this added funding. Gifted education The District Administration reported that 127 or 4.33% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. This approach permits such specialized instructional strategies as tiered assignments, curriculum compacting, flexible grouping, learning stations, independent projects and independent contracts. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying policy The Blue Mountain School District administration reported there were no incidents of bullying in the district in 2012. There were 2 cases of sexual harassment. The District administration reported there were 2 incidents of bullying in the district in 2009. The credibility of these reports is unfortunately less than plausible, with most students witnessing this many incidents daily. The Blue Mountain School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2013, the average teacher salary in Blue Mountain School District was $56, 567 a year.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in Pennsylvania Students, 2013 The District employed 300 teachers with a top salary of $136,475.

Real estate taxes Blue Mountain School Board set property tax rates in 2016‚Äì17 at 37.254 mills.Blue Mountain School Board Secretary, Minutes Blue Mountain School Board Meeting May 2016, May 2016 A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate ‚Äì land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and all government property (local, state and federal). Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75‚Äì85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections (Local Tax Enabling Act), which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2015‚Äì16 ‚Äì 36.275 mills. *2014‚Äì15 ‚Äì 37.254 mills *2013‚Äì14 ‚Äì 36.275 mills. *2012‚Äì13 ‚Äì 35.8800 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2012‚Äì13, 2012 *2011‚Äì12 ‚Äì 34.9000 mills. *2010‚Äì11 ‚Äì 34.9000 mills *2009‚Äì10 ‚Äì 34.01 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School District Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates 2009‚Äì10, 2009 *2008‚Äì09 ‚Äì 32.7000 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School District Real Estate Tax Rates 2008‚Äì09, 2008 *2007‚Äì08 ‚Äì 32.7000 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006‚Äì07 ‚Äì 32.7000 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005‚Äì06 ‚Äì 32.7000 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by Schuylkill County residents amounts to about 2.84% of their yearly income.

Districts are not authorized to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of 0.75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed legislation eliminating six of the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The legislature also froze the payroll amount public school districts use to calculate the pension-plan exception at the 2012 payroll levels. Further increases in payroll cannot be used to raise the district's exception for pension payments.

The play was first performed in 1999 in Colchester before transferring to the West End. It was published by Oberon Books in 2000.Mindgame at WorldCat  Plot  Mark Styler, a writer of \\"true crime\\" stories arrives at the Fairfields experimental hospital for the criminally insane, with the hope of interviewing serial killer Easterman for a new book. He meets Dr. Farquhar, the hospital director, however things don't seem quite right. The doctor is reluctant to let Styler see Easterman, and encourages Styler to leave. Styler, however refuses with the excuse of a long car journey. In the end, he stays and Farquhar offers him dinner. His assistant Nurse Plimpton seems frightened of something, and is anxious. She tries to give a note to Styler, but Farquhar burns it in the bin. She reluctantly makes a pot of tea and liver sandwiches for Styler. After she leaves, the two discuss the book further, but Styler's real feelings about Easterman are revealed. He is desperate to see Easterman, and suggests that he wore a strait-jacket to keep him from damaging anything. Farquhar, seemingly annoyed at this, retrieves a strait jacket from a closet and offers to put it on Styler to show what it is like, and he reluctantly agrees. Once Styler is strapped in, Farquhar taunts him about being mad, and threatens him with a scalpel, then Nurse Plimpton returns, and she knocks Farquhar unconscious with a wine bottle. She explains that Farquhar is in fact Easterman, who killed most of the staff during a \\"psychiatric drama\\" session. Nurse Plimpton is in fact Doctor Carol Ennis. She cannot undo the strait jacket straps, and as she bends down to get the scalpel from Easterman, he awakens and grabs her, then stabs her behind a curtain. When Easterman and Styler begin to talk, it turns out the two men used to be neighbours, and Styler admired Easterman, perhaps even loved him. It appears Styler's motives for visiting are not as they appeared to be. Doctor Ennis suddenly awakens, and cries out for help; Easterman straps her to a chair and after removing the jacket, asks Styler to kill her. Styler is tricked into thinking he is Easterman, and they think up various methods, but in the end Styler suffocates her with a carrier bag. Once it is done, he feels guilt but Ennis awakes and now assumes the role of Doctor Farquhar. She and Farquhar, who is now Carol, completely change, and Styler is told he is Easterman and Styler was just his assumed name. He tries to prove them wrong, however his BMW is gone, and the letter he sent to Farquhar is blank. In the end, Styler is forced to believe he is Easterman, however it is never explicitly revealed to the audience who is actually who.

Around that time (1927) one of his teachers, Alfonso Caso, encouraged what would be the start of his career: he suggested Henestrosa write down Zapotec myths, legends and fables, which formed the basis of his first book, The Men Scattered by Dance, published in 1929. Henestrosa contributed in many ways to Zapotec culture, keeping a line of investigation and exaltation of it; he also was one of the Mexican exponents of the literary movement called Indianismo, since his first book. He also wrote essays and political documents during his long career. In 1936, the Guggenheim Foundation gave him a scholarship to investigate about Zapotec culture and visited United States at the linguistic, resulting in Zapotec language phonetization, the adaptation of the Latin alphabet and a Zapotec‚ÄìSpanish dictionary. During this trip, while in New Orle√°ns in 1937, he wrote one of his most famous books: My Mother‚Äôs Portrait (\\"El retrato de mi madre\\"). He was a member of the Mexican Language Academy from October 23, 1964, to his death, as numerary member with chair 23. He was the treasurer of the Academy from 1965 to 2000. Andr√©s Henestrosa was one of the most prominent members of the Mexican intelligentsia.  Political career  In 1929, he supported (as did many UNAM students) the presidential campaign of Jos√© Vasconcelos, being an active part of the campaign acts and writing many essays and chronicles. But almost all of the original hand-wrote transcriptions were lost, being published in many magazines and newspapers. In 1982 he was elected senator for his home state, Oaxaca, as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Awards *Belisario Dom√≠nguez Medal of Honor, 1993.

The work force grew to nearly 5,000 by 1985 making the Reading, Pennsylvania, facility one of Berks County's largest industrial employers. As a part of Western Electric and the Bell System, it changed its masthead many times during its life.The Reading Eagle, 6/17/07, Our industrious roots: Western Electric, This was Silicon Valley; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. 1952: From Allentown to Laureldale The origins can be traced back to 1876, when Elisha Gray lost his race to invent the telephone. Alexander Graham Bell put in a patent application just hours before Gray filed one. Gray nevertheless left his mark on the telephone industry in 1869 when he and Enos N. Barton formed Gray and Barton, a small manufacturing firm in Cleveland, Ohio. Three years later, the firm, now based in Chicago, was renamed the Western Electric Manufacturing Co. By 1880 it was the largest electrical manufacturing company in the US. A year later when growth of the telephone network was outstripping the capacity of smaller suppliers, American Bell purchased a controlling interest in Western Electric Company and made it the exclusive manufacturer of equipment for the Bell telephone companies. Western Electric Company was responsible for developing as well as manufacturing Bell equipment. In 1907, Theodore N. Vail combined the AT&T; and Western Electric engineering departments into a single organization that became Bell Labs in 1925. Western Electric became the manufacturing arm of the Bell System. In 1951, just four years after the invention of the transistor by Bell Laboratories, the Allentown Plant was opened to manufacture the first transistors.Prescott C. Mabon (1975). Mission Communications: The Story of Bell Laboratories; Murray Hill (NJ), US; Bell Laboratories. Page 181Western Electric Co. (1983). Western Electric Reading Works:; Reading (PA), US; Page 3 Jack Morton was assigned to develop transistors for manufacture. He had been responsible for inventing and providing the military with microwave components during WWII and knew how to get an idea from the lab, into production, and into the field. He established a system of branch labs at several Western Electric plants, consisting of teams of Bell Labs scientists and engineers focused on production engineering and acting as liaison with their colleagues back in Murray Hill. Morton fine- tuned this approach at the new Western Electric plant in Allentown, Pa., which produced electronic devices and components for the Bell System. He set up a Bell Labs semiconductor development group there and put Eugene Anderson in charge.Michael Riordan (2006). \\"IEEE Spectrum, Volume 43, Issue 12,\\"\\" How Bell Labs Missed the Microchip\\"; IEEE Press, Piscataway (NJ), US; Page 36-41 In 1952, operations in Reading began when Western Electric Company (WECO) converted the old Rosedale knitting mill in Laureldale into a factory that produced electronic components for the U.S. government for use by the military and the space program.The Reading Eagle, 12/6/98, \\"Once a wee mill, Western Electric now dominant employer in Berks\\"; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.

Page 204 By the end of 1952, there were 130 employees, and by the end of 1953, 253 employees. On January 12, 1956, a diffused base transistor was unveiled at Laureldale before top military brass at a solid-state diffusion symposium. That was the same year that Bell Labs' scientists Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley received the 1956 Nobel Prize in physics for the invention of the transistor. \\"Bell Laboratories scientists in Murray Hill, N.J., may have won the Nobel Prizes and gotten most of the press, but Allentown and Reading delivered the goods,\\" notes Stuart W. Leslie, a historian of science at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.Michael Riordan (2005). \\"IEEE Spectrum, Volume 42, Issue 7,\\"\\" The End of \\"AT&T;\\"; IEEE Press, Piscataway (NJ), US; Page 46-51 In 1958, a group of Bell Laboratories scientists moved to Reading, Pennsylvania, from other locations and started the Laureldale Laboratory in the Laureldale Western Electric Plant. Bell Labs was a division of Western Electric. Initially the Laureldale Laboratory designed electron tubes (vacuum tubes). Eventually, after becoming the Reading Laboratory, it designed semiconductor devices which eventually included integrated circuits, light emitting diodes, and lasers. 1962: From Laureldale to Reading By the late 1950s, the increased demand for its products necessitated Western Electric building a larger facility, so plans were developed for a building at the North 11th Street site. The Greater Berks Development Fund built the Reading plant at the end of 11th street for $2 million to lease to Bell Labs and Western Electric. Ground breaking took place in November 1960, and on January 2, 1962, Western Electric took possession of the new building, Building 30 (the manufacturing building). In 1964, Western Electric bought the building. By 1966 all facilities had moved from the Laureldale plant to the Muhlenberg Township, Pennsylvania, site. The new facility was called the Reading Works and the branch of Bell Labs was called the Reading Labs.The Reading Eagle, 2/16/92, AT&T; Reading Works plans on growth; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. In 1967, when the Reading Works celebrated its 15th anniversary in Berks County, it employed about 2,600 employees. Various additions since the mid-1960s increased the manufacturing space to . Construction on the office building (Building 20) began in 1980, and the building was first occupied in 1982. 1984: Western Electric to AT&T; Technologies In 1984 the Bell System broke up into the various Baby Bell operating companies and AT&T.; As a result of this divestiture in 1984, the Western Electric plant became an AT&T; Technology Systems (AT&T; Technology Systems) location as part of AT&T;, supplying devices for use in the former Bell System's network. By 1984, employment had reached what would be an all- time high of 4,900.The Reading Eagle, 12/31/06, A time of CHANGE:; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. In 1988, microchip and fiber-optic component manufacturing was combined into an AT&T; organization called AT&T; Microelectronics. In 1989 the AT&T; work force nationwide was 297,000 and while employment at the Reading Works was 3,200.The Reading Eagle, 12/14/89, 25 local jobs at risk in AT&T; restructuring; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. In 1992 the Reading Works of AT&T; Microelectronics had 3,300 workers and provided an annual payroll of $100 million. The product mix included lightwave components, linear bipolar integrated circuits, high voltage integrated circuits, high speed silicon integrated circuits, and gallium arsenide integrated circuits. A satellite manufacturing building, Building 10, was constructed on North 13th Street, just north of the General Mail Facility, in 1992. The same year the Falconer building across the street was also used. AT&T; Reading Works was the No. 2 employer in Berks County in 1993,The Reading Eagle, 1/04/04 but that was soon to end. In February 1994, AT&T; Reading Works announced that it would be cutting 850 jobs over a 3-year period.Reading Eagle Company (2000). A 20th Century Journey: 1990-1999; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. Page 10 In 1994 the Reading Works' work force was reduced from 2,929 to 2,700 with most of the cuts in the Lightwave unit. The Lightwave unit makes fiber-optic laser transmitters and receivers.The Reading Eagle, 11/09/94, Reading Works to lay off 84 workers; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. In 1995 the Reading Works' work force stood at 2,400 including AT&T; Microelectronics and Bell Labs as it prepared for the spin off from AT&T; into Lucent Technologies.The Reading Eagle, 9/21/95, Reading Works will be part of manufacturing company; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. 1996: AT&T; to Lucent Under the 1996 restructuring of AT&T;, AT&T; Technologies became Lucent Technologies. The Lucent Technologies Reading, Pennsylvania, facility became both a Lucent Microelectronics and a Lucent Optoelectronics facility, designing and manufacturing optoelectronic and integrated circuit components for applications in the telecommunications and computing industries. The Lucent Reading Plant was unique in the semiconductor industry because it manufactured both optoelectronic and integrated circuit components. The facility received a $6 million renovation to boost its optoelectronics manufacturing capacity. In addition to serving the traditional communications markets, the Lucent Optoelectronics portion of the facility provided a family of transmitters and receivers for use in network computing applications. Lucent was also a leading player in the cable TV and hybrid fiber coaxial markets. In addition to Reading, Pennsylvania, other Lucent Optoelectronics facilities were located in Breinigsville, Pennsylvania; Murray Hill, New Jersey; Alhambra, California; and Matamoros, Mexico. The Lucent Microelectronics portion of the facility produced linear bipolar, high voltage and gallium arsenide integrated circuits. These microchips were used in tone ringers, data processing, voltage regulators, video distribution, and in the industrial, computer, communication and instrumental markets. In addition to Reading, other Lucent Microelectronics integrated circuit sites included Allentown, Pennsylvania; Orlando, Florida; Bangkok, Thailand; Tres Cantos, Spain; and Singapore. In 1996 the Reading Works' work force stood at 2,450 including AT&T; Microelectronics and Bell Labs as it made the transition from AT&T; into Lucent Technologies.The Reading Eagle, 2/6/96, Reading Works to be Lucent Technologies; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. The spin off of AT&T; manufacturing units as Lucent Technologies became necessary as these units increasingly found that their prospective customers were AT&T; competitors. The divestiture of the manufacturing units made them suppliers rather than competitors, opening up new markets to Lucent and to the Reading Works. At the same time it caused the anxiety that comes with change.The Reading Eagle, 6/23/96, Lucent Technologies to focus on the future; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. On October 1, 1996, Lucent Technologies became independent of AT&T.; The Reading Works became Lucent Technologies Reading Facility.

In 2000, Lucent Microelectronics and Optoelectronics were reorganized as Agere Systems with the intention of spinning it off as an independent company. Agere Systems Inc. produced high- tech components such as opto-electronics products, which use light-wave technologies to transmit information, and integrated circuits, which are miniaturized chips used in computers and communications. The opto-electronics parts were used in systems such as submarine communication cables, cable transmitters, cable receivers, laser components, and network computing devices. The integrated circuits were found in a wide array of electronic products from modems and computers to cell phones and telephone offices to video equipment and digital television. After becoming Agere Systems, by the end of 2000, the Reading Facility became the Muhlenberg plant and had grown its workforce by 800 to 3,000 as the anticipated lightwave business materialized.The Reading Eagle, 12/17/00, Berks County's top 20 employers; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. In 2001, Agere Systems's stock went public in late March. The spin-off was completed on June 1, 2002. By mid-2001, Agere cut 508 jobs at the Reading Works.The Reading Eagle, 5/9/01, Agere boosts job cuts in Berks; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.

The planned changes involved closing the Breinigsville, Pennsylvania plant in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, which was opened in 1988;The Reading Eagle, 12/8/04, TriQuint cutting jobs in Lehigh; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. selling the Orlando plant in Florida; and consolidating several locations in New Jersey. All operations were consolidated at the Allentown, Pennsylvania, headquarters location and the New Jersey locations. About 1,500 workers were transferred from Reading to Allentown where 3,200 workers were employed prior to the relocation. As Agere was leaving, Legerity, Inc., assumed some of the operations formerly done by the Muhlenberg plant in the old Building 10 on North 13th Street. In this facility Legerity assembled 40 former Agere circuit-design, physical-design, application-design and process development engineers to support the analog line card integrated circuit business it purchased from Agere. Legerity is a design facility that uses other companies foundries to manufacture its products.The Reading Eagle, 2/23/03, New Berks chip operation has a familiar ring; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. In May 2003, Agere Systems Inc. ended all manufacturing and began decommissioning its Muhlenberg Township plant. The last 346 manufacturing employees were laid off. About 50 employees ‚Äî mostly maintenance ‚Äî remained at the plant until a buyer was found.The Reading Eagle, 5/55/03, Agere shuts down Muhlenberg plant; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. Agere built a $165 million World Headquarters building in Hanover Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. This building was started in 2001 and completed in 2003. It brought together research and development facilities from Breinigsville and Muhlenberg Township. It absorbed about 2,000 workers from these two facilities.The Reading Eagle, 4/7/02, Agere Moves Up; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. Agere Systems tried unsuccessfully to sell its Union Boulevard plant in Allentown, where the first commercial production line for transistors was set up in 1951. Agere Systems demolished the manufacturing part of the Union Boulevard facility. The company continues to use the offices and wet labs in the remaining part of the building. Its headquarters building is nearby in Hanover Township, Pennsylvania. In 2003, Agere Systems sold the chip plant and research center in Breinigsville to TriQuint Semiconductor, which also bought the company's fiber-optic components division. The facility, now under different ownership, is a multi-tenant technology park. At the end of 1999 shares of Lucent stock hit a high of nearly $80. After spinning off Agere Systems, Lucent shares dropped to around $4.50 and later dropped to $0.55 in October 2002. After being spun off, Agere shares were about $4 and dropped to a low of $0.50 in October 2002. Agere started 2000 with 18,000 employees. By the end of the year it had only 10,000 employees. By the end of 2001 the number of employees had dropped to about 7,000. The last wafer starts at the Reading Works were scheduled for April, 2003 and the last shipments were scheduled for May, 2003. The doors locked on May 16, 2003. Starting May 17, the Reading work force consisted of 100 employees who cleaned up the facility and disposed of equipment. In July the work force was down to 50 maintenance employees who manned the facility while an attempts were made to sell it or at least rent or lease it. On December 13, 2005, it was announced that Agere had signed a sales agreement with a Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, developer to sell the Agere Systems Inc. property in Muhlenberg Township, Pennsylvania, and projects the return of 1,000 jobs to the site within 18 months, with more jobs to follow. 2005: From the USA The last USA based Agere Systems manufacturing plant in Orlando, Florida, which once employed 1,800, was closed on September 30, 2005, after 20 years of semiconductors manufactureThe Orlando Sentinel 1/10/05, Orlando (FL), US and sold in 2007. The company has plants in Singapore and Thailand, and operated 22 sales offices and 16 research and development facilities throughout the world. Its key centers are in Ascot, U.K.; Bangalore, India; San Jose, CA, U.S.; Shanghai, China; and Singapore as well as the world headquarters in Lehigh Valley, PA. Agere Systems still maintained its position as a key chip supplier for cell phones and hard disk drives. However, the chips it supplied were purchased from outside chip foundries or made offshore rather than made locally. In 2003, 3,000 of the best jobs in town disappeared when Agere Systems closed the Reading Works. But the jobs won't come back when the economy does; like many other high-tech companies, Agere Systems moved production overseas. Outsourcing is a new name for a long-standing phenomenon: the movement of jobs from the USA to countries where wages, benefits and the cost of living are much lower. In the 1970s and 1980s, heavy manufacturing jobs went to other countries by the tens of thousands. The result was cheaper goods for U.S. consumers and less pollution in many of the nation's industrial cities. Economists who backed the trend envisioned a new \\"knowledge economy\\" in which well-trained Americans would become the world's designers, innovators and administrators. The dirty work would be sent overseas. Not to take advantage of those countries' pools of highly educated, relatively low-wage workers would be foolish, Agere Systems officials said. \\"Our customers are very demanding,\\" says John Harris, an engineer and marketing manager at Agere's Allentown, Pennsylvania, headquarters. \\"They're under intense pressure to deliver extremely high quality at extremely low cost. That pressure comes right back on us.\\" On December 4, 2006, Agere's President and CEO, Rick Clemmer, announced that it would be bought by LSI Logic Corporation of Milpitas, California in an all- stock transaction. On March 29, 2007, this merger was approved by shareholders of both companies, making it official.The Morning Call 3/30/07, Allentown (PA), US The companies together own a patent portfolio consisting of more than 10,000 issued and pending U.S. patents.The Reading Eagle, 12/5/06, California firm buying Agere; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. Spun off by Lucent Technologies in 2001, Agere Systems was the creation of a corporate behemoth, while LSI was born 25 years ago as a tiny startup. LSI Logic already has decided to dump the Agere name, which once symbolized the Lehigh Valley's aspirations to become a technology hub. Compared to Agere Systems, LSI Logic has run a tight ship. It generates roughly 20 percent more revenue ‚Äî $2 billion ‚Äî with fewer employees worldwide: 3,900, compared to Agere's 5,300. LSI Logic will use the Agere Systems facilities as the center of its research operations, but the combined company's headquarters will be in Milpitas, California. LSI Logic has come a long way since 1981, when Wilfred Corrigan founded the company with $6 million of venture capital. Corrigan, a native of Liverpool, England, moved to the United States to pursue a career in electronics. He climbed the ladder at Motorola in Phoenix, Arizona, before becoming CEO of Fairchild Semiconductor in Mountain View, California, in the mid-1970s. The launch of LSI Logic marked his transition to entrepreneur. The company went public in 1983. By the mid-1990s, LSI Logic was selling chips to Sony for its PlayStation video game machine. And in 2001, it made its first major acquisition, C-Cube Microsystems, in a stock deal valued at $851 million. In recent times, LSI Logic has followed a strategy similar to Agere Systems. This year, the company sold an Oregon semiconductor manufacturing facility and acquired two smaller companies, in Israel and India. Now it's swallowing up Agere Systems, which is nearly its equal, in terms of revenue but not productivity. Hence ends the saga of the semiconductor plant that was built in Reading in 1952. 2006: Greater Reading Expo Center Audubon Land Development of Oaks, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, bought the old Reading Works in December 2005 for an undisclosed amount. Agere Systems spokesman Glen Haley confirmed the deal. Agere Systems had been asking for $8 million for the property, but Haley and Call declined to disclose the purchase price. The assessment of the property was lowered to $9.5 million from $26.3 million after Agere Systems appealed. On Tuesday, March 14, 2006, Urban Expositions, a Georgia-based trade show company, announced it would hold the 10th annual Philadelphia Gift Show at the Reading center July 23‚Äì26, 2006. The facility is being called the Greater Reading Expo Center. A company press release calls the event, with an expected 1,400 booths, the largest regional gift show in the country. Gene Call, an Audubon spokesman, said Audubon's subsidiary, Stonepoint Management Corp., which is leasing the Agere Systems building, would run the exposition center. Stonepoint would use , he said. Stonepoint is exploring other uses but has not made firm plans, he said. Crystal Seitz, president of the Greater Reading Convention & Visitors Bureau, said a typical convention center with a steady stream of shows generates about $150 million for a local economy, including money spent for lodging and meals. Jon C. Scott, president of the Berks Economic Partnership, said he has met several times with Audubon officials and is excited about the prospects for the center. ‚ÄúIt opens up the type of exhibits that would never have been available before,‚Äù Scott said. ‚ÄúIt leads to other intriguing possibilities.‚Äù Some of the shows scheduled for the facility included: Philadelphia Gift Show which includes Birdwatch America-Philadelphia, Great Train Expo, Bead Fest Philadelphia, Greater Philadelphia Pet Expo, Great American Guitar Show, Sports Card & Memorabilia Show,The Reading Eagle, 3/01/07, Sports memorabilia show at expo center; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. Home & Garden Show,The Reading Eagle, 3/8/07, Making value judgments; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. and The Greater Reading Sport, Travel & Outdoors Show. Success of the Expo Center is in part due to the closing of the Fort Washington Exposition Center in Montgomery County and the Pennsylvania Expo Center in Lehigh County and in part due to the of inside space, several auditoriums, numerous meeting rooms, 13 loading docks, ample parking and a full-service cafeteria among its amenities, the expo center.The Reading Eagle, 10/29/06, Two closed expo centers give renovated local site a big boost.; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. Muhlenberg Township waived the 10% amusement tax on admission to the expo center from January through September 2007. This was an attempt to allow the Expo Center to become better established. The township estimates future revenues at $50,000 per year.The Reading Eagle, 12/19/06, Expo center granted break on taxes; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press. The Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development included the StonePointe Center, the former Agere complex in Muhlenberg Township, which includes the Greater Reading Expo Center, as part of the Greater Reading Keystone Innovation Zone and invested $235,000 to fund its operations. Also included in this zone is TEK Park, the former home of Lucent/Agere Optoelectronics in Breinigsville, Lehigh County, which houses a number of industrial tenants and the Kutztown University Innovation Center.The Reading Eagle, 11/15/06, State creates local job-growth area; Reading (PA), US; Reading Eagle Press.

The band formed in the mid 1990s with a short but productive career and released three albums in their native Dominican Republic. The band enjoyed local success in the Santo Domingo rock scene and released music videos like \\"El Precio\\" which enjoyed rotation in MTV. While enjoying success in their native country, the band was never able to push for international success. Sintetik, the band's last album, represented the band's maturation and professionalism but never made it out of the local scene. Tabu Tek later on withdrew from releasing new material but still play shows in the local scene from time to time. In 2008 Maximo Martinez released new solo material named Electr√≥nica Ensemble Como Concepto Perform√°tico. History=New Page: Maximo Martinez, Early Days Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s Maximo Martinez participated in the Dominican electronic rock band New Page and produced a series of rock songs that laid the foundations for his later work. At the time, the rock scene was just starting to gain popularity in Santo Domingo. Shortly before the creation of Tabu Tek, Maximo Martinez disbanded New Page. New Page had a few significant songs that received airplay; those being \\"5 a≈àos\\", \\"Triangulo\\" and \\"Blanco y Negro\\". Tabu Tek: Release of Girar, Rise of Popularity, Sintetik and Hiatus After Martinez disbanded New Page, he settled down with Bassist Tomas Alvarez from Toque Profundo and friends Franklin Alvarez, Francisco Polanco, Jacinto Mendez, and Alberto Dujarric and formed Tabu Tek on April 15, 1995 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. In 1996 Tabu Tek released their first album Girar in Santo Domingo, being well received in local radio stations and gaining the band some popularity with the release of singles like Cierra Los Ojos, ' and Escena Gastada. In November 1996 Martinez joined the Chilean rocker Beto Cuevas and sang along with La Ley's greatest hit \\"El Duelo\\" in a concert held in Santo Domingo. Months later, in March 1997 Tabu Tek opened for the Argentinian band Enanitos Verdes in a concert performance in Santo Domingo. In June 1997 Tabu Tek performed in the Dominican Republic's Presidente Festival and received critical acclaim from the international magazine Billboard and also released their second album material Visual. In 1999, Tabu Tek released their third and final album to date, Sintetik, with a more defined electronic rock based sound than in their previous materials. While the band has ceased producing new album material they still sporadically play at local bars in Santo Domingo like the Cinema Cafe in Plaza de la Cultura sector of the city. Maximo Martinez (now Known as Max) remains somewhat active releasing his solo project Electr√≥nica Ensemble Como Concepto Perform√°tico in 2008. Max performed in Clemente Portillo's Bar Calavera as the singer of the song \\"Acuario\\" released in 2010.

He last managed Lega Pro Prima Divisione club Grosseto in 2014. Club career Cuccureddu with Bianconeri in 1969 A central defender, Cuccureddu spent his club playing career with Brescia (1968‚Äì69), Juventus (1969‚Äì81, winning six Serie A titles), and Fiorentina (1981‚Äì83). Rather prolific for being a defender (he had a very strong long distance shot), in one league season he managed to score 12 goals (during the 1973‚Äì74 Italian Serie A season), although in that season he played as a midfielder. His most famous goal in the league was scored at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, facing A.S. Roma in the last match of the 1972‚Äì73 Serie A season: with that goal Juventus beat Roma 2‚Äì1 and won their 15th domestic title by 1 point over A.C. Milan, who were leading the league until the final match of the season, and finished 2 points over S.S. Lazio. International career At international level, Cuccureddu earned 13 caps for the Italy national football team, and played in the 1978 FIFA World Cup (where he featured in 5 fixtures, including the match against Argentina, which Italy won 1‚Äì0, and the 3rd place final against Brazil, which Italy lost 1‚Äì2). Style of play Cuccureddu was a hard-working and tactically versatile footballer, who was capable of aiding his team both offensively and defensively, and of playing anywhere in defence or midfield. Throughout his career, he was primarily deployed as a defender, and was capable of playing as an offensive wing-back, as a full-back, or as a centre-back, which was his usual position. He also played in midfield on occasion, which was his initial position at the beginning of his career, and was deployed as a mezzala, as a central, box-to- box, defensive midfielder, or attacking midfielder on occasion. free kick for Juventus in 1974 As a footballer, he was known in particular for his dynamism, stamina, his ability to read the game, vision, and tactical intelligence. Although he was primarily a defensive-minded player, he was quite prolific in front of goal throughout his career, as he possessed an accurate and powerful shot with his right foot from outside the area, which also made him a dangerous goal threat; due to his striking ability, he was an accurate set-piece and penalty kick taker. Managerial career As a coach, he won both the Torneo di Viareggio and the Campionato Nazionale Primavera in 1994 with the Juventus Primavera side. During the 1999‚Äì2000 Serie C1 season, he led Crotone to the Girone B title, helping the club to Serie B promotion. In the 2006‚Äì07 season he led Grosseto to become Serie C1/A winners and gain a historical first-ever promotion to Serie B. Cuccureddu left Grosseto soon after the end of the season to join Serie C1 club Perugia, where he did not manage to repeat his successes at Grosseto. From March 2009 he was the new head coach of Lega Pro Prima Divisione side Pescara; this adventure ended in January 2010, when he was replaced by Eusebio Di Francesco, former coach of Lanciano. In 2013, he returned to Grosseto in Lega Pro Prima Divisione, where he remained until January 2014, after being sacked, due to the club's negative results. Coaching tactics As a coach, Cuccureddu built his teams on tactically traditional formations, based on defensive stability, favouring a four-man defensive line in either a 4‚Äì4‚Äì2, or a 4‚Äì3‚Äì1‚Äì2 formation.

The river is generally presented as the confluence of: * the Grande Leyre (Large Leyre), its principal course, upstream from Moustey * the Petite Leyre (Small Leyre), its main tributary The combined watercourse Eyre-Grande Lyre is long. Name Eyre is an Aquitanian hydronym. It can be found in such names as Eyres-Moncube, Landes, or the ' (Eyron ditch) in Lacanau, Gironde. Note that Leyre is a variant of the name Eyre, affected by an agglutination of the Romance article.  Geography The Eyre in Mios The basin of the Eyre in included in the parc r√©gional des Landes de Gascogne (National Park of the Moors of Gascony). The river takes form in the Plantiet Marsh, in Grande Lande near Sabres, Landes. It flows north into the Bassin d'Arcachon, a large bay on the Atlantic coast, in the Pays de Buch, Gironde. Its delta of contains the Le Teich ornithological park. The Eyre flows through a preserved environment. Its banks are bordered by a broad- leaved forest. Branches join over the river, forming a gallery forest, that contrasts with the Landes forest, planted with maritime pines.  D√©partements and towns The Eyre flows through the following d√©partements and towns: * Landes: Pissos * Gironde: Belin-B√©liet, Salles, Mios, Le Teich Tributaries The main tributary of the Eyre is the Petite-Leyre. It rises between Luxey and Retjons, in Landes, and flows northwest to join the Grande Leyre downstream from Pissos. * (R) Petite Leyre N.B. : (R) = right tributary; (L) = left tributary Historical sidenote During the establishment of the French d√©partements in 1790, the creation of a large d√©partement corresponding to the natural region of the Landes of Gascony ‚Äì that is to say, today's Landes forest (then still unplanted) ‚Äì was suggested.

Biros was the first condemned person to be executed by lethal injection in the United States with the use of a single drug, setting a Guinness World Record.First judicial single drug execution: Kenneth Biros (USA), a 51-year-old prisoner convicted of murdering a 22-year old woman in 1991, was executed in Ohio, USA, using a single large injection of anaesthetic. It is the first time that a single injection has been used in legal, judicial executions in a democratic state. Murder Biros admitted to killing 22-year-old Tami Engstrom during February 1991 in a fit of rage. Biros then cut up the body and spread numerous parts over a wide territory encompassing portions of northeast Ohio and northwest Pennsylvania. Conviction Biros was convicted of aggravated murder, attempted rape, aggravated robbery and felonious sexual penetration and sentenced to death. He was originally sentenced to die by means of lethal injection at 10:00a.m. on March 20, 2007. This would have been the first execution during Governor Ted Strickland's administration. Governor Strickland denied Biros clemency on March 16, 2007. However, on that day the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the ruling of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that Biros' execution should be stayed to allow him to continue to argue his case that Ohio's lethal injection is cruel and unusual punishment. He was then transferred from Ohio's death row at the Ohio State Penitentiary in Youngstown to the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. On April 24, 2009, Trumbull County Prosecutor Dennis Watkins requested the Ohio Supreme Court to set an execution date after a federal judge decided on Tuesday, April 21, 2009, that Ohio's execution method was flawed, but not unconstitutional. The Supreme Court of Ohio later set a new execution date for December 8, 2009. Execution Biros was executed by lethal injection on December 8, 2009 at 11:00a.m. at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville, Ohio. His execution was originally scheduled for 10:00a.m., but was later delayed until 11:00a.m.. He was pronounced dead at 11:47a.m.. Biros was the first condemned person to be executed with a lethal single-drug dose of an anesthetic, sodium thiopental, in America.

Prior to its commercial release by Wyrd House Press in 2006, the game had been in private circulation, according to publisher Jazz Lieberman, ‚Äúfor well over a decade.‚Äù Interview, \\"All That Jazz,\\" Capes & Cowls: The Wyrd City Chronicles #36 (April 2005), ISSN 1529-076X  Gameplay  Capes & Cowls is a superhero skirmish game in which two to four players each recruit a team of super-powered characters from the Wyrd City dramatis person√¶ and send them into battle against opposing teams. The game is played on a specialized ‚ÄúBattleboard‚Äù whose color- and number-coded spaces influence character abilities, modify power levels, and place strong emphasis on strategic and tactical play. Though the outcome of some actions is occasionally determined by the roll of a ‚ÄúBattle Die,‚Äù luck plays only a small role in the mechanics of the game. Capes & Cowls features three primary modes of play and several variants. The three primary modes, intended exclusively for head-to-head competition, are as follows: ;Basic:In the Basic Game, each player recruits a team of two or three Heroes, deploys the team to the Battleboard, and battles with his opponent‚Äôs team for a predetermined number of rounds. The player with the most Heroes left on the Battleboard at the end of the game wins. ;Standard: The Standard Game allows each player to recruit a team of four or five Heroes, and introduces Scene Features such as Rooftops, Walls, and Trees, as well as Objects such as Boulders, Cars, and Mailboxes. These elements enrich the Battleboard environment and call for keener strategies and sharper tactics. As in the Basic Game, the player with the most Heroes left on the Battleboard at the end of the game wins. ;Adventure: The Adventure Game requires the players to select an Adventure from the Adventure Book. Each Adventure includes a full-color map for Battleboard setup, instructions for team recruitment, and special rules for playing the chosen Adventure, including team-specific goals and victory conditions. This mode of play incorporates Crew characters, special items, and plot devices that further define the Wyrd City universe and its colorful assortment of costumed denizens. The victory in an Adventure Game goes to the player whose team succeeds in fulfilling the predetermined goal of the Adventure. Setting Though Capes & Cowls emulates the visual aesthetics and fanciful exploits of golden-age and silver-age superhero comic books, its action takes place in a markedly dystopian alternate universe wherein the entire known world falls under the tyrannical jurisdiction of the Wyrd City Powers That Be (WCPTB) and its street-level enforcers, the Wyrd City Freedom Patrol. Indignant at the appropriation of their sacred name by a government so oppressive, the celestial Sisters Wyrd unleash upon the world the long-buried forces of mystery, wonder, and magic. This act of cosmic intervention, over time, brings into being a pantheon of super-powered heroes and villains (aside from their telltale biographies and certain scenarios in the game's Adventure Book, no overt distinctions are made between the two) who find themselves at constant odds with not only the Wyrd City Freedom Patrol, but often with each other as well. Characters The characters included in the Capes & Cowls master set (all of them principals and supporting cast from the Wyrd City universe) are divided into two types‚ÄîHeroes and Crews. Both are represented by stand-up figures and character cards. Heroes are depicted on large, blue character cards and defined by name, portrait, stats, and three unique powers, while Crews are depicted on small, gray character cards and defined by name, portrait, stats, and one unique power. The Heroes, Crews, and character- specific powers are as follows: Heroes * Baron Necro (Summon the Dead, Kiss of Death, Zombify) * Battery-Man (Voltaic Assault, Acid Splash, Recharge) * Black Manx (Pounce, Bad Luck, Caterwaul of Doom) * Blaze (Fireborn, Great Balls of Fire, Up in Flames) * Blue Malkin (Diamond Claws, Heightened Senses, Nine Lives) * Brown Recluse (Venom Punch, Web Shoot, Hide) * Da-Blink (Teleport, Blink-n-Bop, Poof!) * Dagon (Mermight, Water Speed, Perilous Waters) * Demoniac (Glide, Demonic Descent, Infernal Resilience) * Diablo Azul (Bedevil, Mind Control, The Devil‚Äôs Own) * Doctor Grimfate (Curse, Thwart, Tragic End) * Elastra (Stretch-n-Smack, Entangle, Rubberama Mama) * Fantazm (Ghostly Grasp, Spectral Passage, Fantazmal Form) * Frostbite (Ice Surf, Freeze Ray, Glacial Shield) * Golden Rocket (Blast Off!, Palm Thrusters, Human Missile) * Green Gremlin (Jinx, Marplot, Backfire) * Hellrags (Hellfork, Soulsuck, Scarecrow Smother) * Hotshot (Crack Shot, Boom Ball, Bull‚Äôs-eye) * Lady Lightning (Fists of Lightning, Lightning Bolt, Lickety-split) * Manchine (Dynablast, Power Boost, Lockdown) * Marasmos (Wither, Shrivel, Decay) * Mole (Tunnel, Surprise Attack, Cave-in) * Moon-Beast (Beastly Transformation, Lunatical Vigor, Bad Moon Rising) * Mysteria (Sorcerous Assault, Enchantment, Bewitch) * Nightshade (Nightforce, Noctiblast, Shadow Walk) * Red Rook (Flight, Swoop Assault, Battle Shriek) * Serapha (Divine Ascent, Heal, Sanctuary) * Star Knight (Star Blade, Star Shield, Stellar Leadership) * Tenebro (Dark Rend, Scotoshield, Blackout) * Time Meister (Time Warp, Time Rift, Time‚Äôs Up) * Titana (Outmuscle, Harsh Mistress, Hard Woman) * Ygg (Monstrous Smash, Thunder Stomp, Regeneration) Crews * Arachnidrones (Spider Climb) * Darklings (Pitch Dark) * Diabloids (Devil Driven) * Freedom Patrols (Freedom Blaster) * Liberty Bots (Built for Battle) * Thugs (Pistol) * Zombies (Zombify) ReferencesExternal links * *Capes & Cowls at Tric Trac *Capes & Cowls at Fantastic Fiction Category:Adventure board games Category:Collectible miniatures games ","title":"Capes &amp; Cowls"},{"id":"10169947","text":"Woodland School District 50 is in Lake County, Illinois.

Among his main paintings the two large pictures that depict St. Bruno in the church of San Bartolomeo at Certosa, in the Genoese district of Rivarolo, the paintings in the Oratory of Assunta, nearby the church of Coronata, in the district of Cornigliano, considered his masterpiece and those in the church of Nostra Signora del Carmine in Genoa, that depict ‚ÄúCarmelites Saints‚Äù and ‚ÄúVirgin Mother and St. John‚Äù.

Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., 532 U.S. 424 (2001), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court involving the standard of review that Federal Appeal Courts should use when examining punitive damages awards. Prior history Leatherman Tool Group made a multifunction tool that was arguably uniquely new at the time of its introduction. In 1995, Cooper Industries, a competing toolmaker, decided to enter the same market niche with a similar tool. The competing product was originally to be nearly identical to the original, save a few cosmetic changes. When introducing the new tool at the 1996 National Hardware Show, the advertising materials, catalogs, and a mock-up were, in fact, modified versions of the original Leatherman tool. After the trade show, Leatherman Tool Group filed a civil suit against Cooper Industries asserting claims of trade-dress infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising under the Lanham Act and a common-law claim of unfair competition for advertising and selling an imitation. In October 1997, a federal jury returned a verdict against Cooper Industries on the false advertising, imitation, and unfair competition claims and assessed damages. It awarded Leatherman Tool Group $50,000.00 in compensatory damages and $4.5 Million in punitive damages. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the punitive damages on appeal, stating that the damages were not \\"grossly excessive\\" under BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore . Case The case was argued on February 26, 2001. Cooper Industries asked the Court to decide whether the Court of Appeals reviewed the constitutionality of the punitive damages award under the correct standard. Because the Court itself has recognized that determining if a fine is grossly excessive is \\"inherently imprecise\\" Gore held that it was necessary to evaluate a number of factors. *The degree of the defendant's reprehensibility or culpability *The relationship between the penalty and the harm to the victim caused by the defendant's actions *The sanctions imposed in other cases for comparable misconduct The Appeals Court has the responsibility on appeal of determining if the lower District court had evaluated these factors correctly. Instead of merely deciding whether the lower court had abused its judicial discretion, the punitive damages should be reviewed in their entirety. By doing so, the Appeals courts would ensure that the courts in its circuit applied these standards in a uniform manner and that citizens would receive uniform treatment. Effects of the decision In making its decision, the Court extended the holding in Furman v. Georgia that the Eighth Amendment applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. While Furman confirmed the earlier incorporation of the 8th Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment clause in Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 667 (1962) Cooper Industries v. Leatherman Tool Group incorporated the Excessive Fines clause. The Court later seemed to back away from this holding. Justice Stevens' Opinion for the Court directly stated: \\"...the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause imposes substantive limits on the States' discretion, making the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishments applicable to the States.\\" Nine years later, however, in a footnote to his Opinion for the Court in McDonald v. City of Chicago, , Justice Alito wrote: \\"We never have decided whether the Third Amendment or the Eighth Amendment‚Äôs prohibition of excessive fines applies to the States through the Due Process Clause.\\" The discrepancy between these two views was resolved in Timbs v. Indiana, wherein the Court unanimously ruled that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of excessive fines is an incorporated protection applicable to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment. Subsequent history On remand to the Ninth Circuit, applying the de novo review standard the Appeals court reduced the punitive damages to $500,000.00.

London. CIPD (November 2004 - rev 2008)  Background  In organisational development, management effectiveness is recognized as a determinant of organisational success. Therefore, investment in management development can have a direct economic benefit to the organisation. In 2004, the money spent per year per manager on management and leadership development was ¬£1,035, an average of 6.3 days per manager.Chartered Management Institute  Approaches to management development  * Dysfunction analysis * Mentoring * Coaching * Job rotation * Professional development * Business workflow analysis * Upward feedback * Executive education * Supervisory training  Action learning  Many management qualifications now have an action learning element. Action learning asserts that individuals learn best from hands-on experience.  Coaching  Coaching is a teaching, training or development process in which an individual is supported while achieving a specific personal or professional result or goal. Coaching is an effective learning tool that affects the bottom line and productivity, as well as intangible benefits. It aids in the improvement of individual performance, tackles underperformance, and aids in the identification of personal learning needs.  Management education  One of the biggest growth areas in UK education since the early 1980s has been the growth of university-level management education. In addition to weekly part- time attendance at college/university, many students employ distance learning. The number of UK business schools grew from two in the early 1970s, to over one hundred providers.  Management development programme  Management development programmes (MDP) are conducted by big corporates and management institutes in order to enable current and prospective managers to develop an understanding of management concepts, practices, approaches and perspectives. The participants gain an immersive learning experience and are encouraged to provide insights on situational problems and are exposed to the views of other participants of their group. Through this process, they gain problem solving skills and analytical thinking ability.

Its story continues from where the previous book, The Icebound Land, ended. This book was a finalist for the 2006 Aurealis Award for Best Children's Novel. The book continues to track Will on his adventures and includes such characters as Halt, his mentor, and Horace, his best friend. Plot summary In the previous book, The Icebound Land, Cassandra (the Crown Princess of Araluen) and Will (the apprentice Ranger) had been captured and sold as slaves. As time went on, Halt (Will's former mentor) and Horace (a Battleschool apprentice and Will's friend) travelled across Gallica, defeating knights, and ridding Gallica of the evil warlord Deparnieux. They are now in Gallica ready to travel through a pass into Skandia to save Will and Cassandra. Meanwhile, Will has overcome his addiction to warmweed and finally regains his senses. Evanlyn, revealed to be Princess Cassandra, is out checking traps for food when she is taken hostage by a member of a Temujai scout party, or Tem'uj. Halt and Horace, still on their rescue mission, find a border outpost of which a dozen Skandians lay dead, shot. Halt manages to recognise an arrow, shot by the Temujai and becomes instantly worried. Two decades ago, the Temujai had nearly conquered the world, but with politics and a dish of bad shellfish, the invasion was stopped. Halt and Horace, after managing to track the Temujai down, came to Will's aid and they rescue Cassandra. Halt and the group, after being reunited, were then captured by Erak, the Skandian Jarl who had set Cassandra and Will free. Erak had been trying to track down the people who shot the Skandians at the other gate, and hastily came to a conclusion that Halt was the one who did it. Halt gave a list of reasons, which convinced the senior Jarl to listen to him. The Skandians have no chance, as they are greatly outnumbered and the Temujai have long-range archers, versus the Skandians one-on-one close combat. Halt, Cassandra, Will, and Horace are now forced to stay in Skandia because the Temujai have blocked their only exit to their homeland. Erak came to a decision into trying to get Ragnak, the Oberjarl, to let Halt become their strategist as he had lived and fought with and against the Temujai before, thus knowing their battle plans and style of fighting. Halt and Erak also manage to find the main army of the Temujai, followed with a very narrow escape because of Erak's extreme clumsiness. Halt and Will also manage to convince the Oberjarl into getting the slaves to become archers with their reward of freedom, of which Ragnak had to very reluctantly accept. 100 Skandians were also supposed to use hit-and-run tactics to delay the Temujai from reaching Hallasholm. The Temujai were not expecting this kind of strategic action from the blunt Skandians. Further on in the story, the Temujai begins their first attack with strategic units known as Ulans and, as Halt had said, made a fake retreat of which the Skandians purposely followed their \\"ambush\\". Halt, however, had placed a group of Skandians in the bushes to ambush the Temujai. This drove them back to the General of the Army, along with the Colonel of Intelligence, were very surprised because the Skandians were not behaving anything at all from what they've heard. In the battle, Will manages to keep his archers concealed for a while, but they are soon spotted. Will kept his archers firing their arrows, but they were defeated. Meanwhile, the Skandians made an impact on the opposing army, and the General had to retreat back to his homeland because he lost too many warriors. The Skandians did not win, they simply made it too costly for the Temujai to continue. Erak takes the group back to their home. After a long happy reunion, Will and Cassandra then find out that Halt has been banished; Erak saves the awkward moment by trying to include it in their treaty to pardon him, of which King Duncan agrees. In the end, Halt was rewarded with his reunion back with the Rangers, Horace with his knighthood and position as the Royal Guards, and Will was offered to become one of the Royal Scouts, a high position in the King's army that trains archers, into which only nobles are admitted; this would give him fame and reputation, but Will, in his heart, turns the offer down. Will wants to continue his training to become a full-fledged Ranger. Cassandra, near the end as well, is sad because her friendship with Will is breaking up, but happy that he is doing what he loves.

The estate can be traced back to 1382, to its first owner, Markvard P√∏iske. The estate developed from a village called \\"Berith\\", situated where the Berritzgaard manor house now stands. Later, the Huitfeldt family purchased the estate. Jacob Huitfeldt and his wife Lisebeth Friis built the present manor house that was constructed by Hans van Steenwinckel the Elder. Lisebeth Friis was widowed before the house was finished in 1586. The style of the house is in the Dutch Renaissance architectural style and Berritzgaard is considered to be the most unspoiled example of a manor house from this style period in Denmark. History= Ownership by the Huitfeldt Family, Sale to Abraham Lehn  In 1654, Joachim Gersdorff, the widower after Huitfeldt, sold the Berritzgaard estate to Hans Wilhelm von Harstall, who was the \\"Chosen Prince Christian's\\" stable master. His son, Christian Ulrich von Harstall, became King Christian V's Master of the Royal Stables. Because of his service to the Kingdom, he was given additional land to add to the Berritzgaard estate. This was the only time in the history of Berritzgaard that the estate was expanded by royal gift. After being widowed, his daughter sold Berritzgaard to Abraham Lehn (the Younger) in 1729. Johan Lehn, Abraham's the Elder's father, had emigrated to Denmark from the Netherlands. The Lehn family made their fortune in the wine trade, grocery trade and in the shipping business, with Abraham Lehn the Elder being the director of the Danish East India Company. Their primary import product was tea from Ceylon.  Creation of the Barony of Guldborgland  Johan Lehn Abraham Lehn the Younger's son, Poul Abraham Lehn, created the Barony of Guldborgland from his holdings at Berritzgaard and the purchase of the Oreby Estate in 1775, combining all of his possessions northwest of Saksk√∏bing. In the 1790s, much work was done on the grounds by Johan Christian Boas, a German landscape architect who brought knowledge on farming and crop rotation to the estate, including the use of clover as a rotation crop. His plans for the gardens at Berritzgaard won national prizes in Denmark. According to tradition, Poul Lehn's only son out of his four children died when he fell out of a window at the Berritzgaard house, so the Guldborgland barony later went to Poul Lehn's granddaughter. She was Christiane Henriette von Barner, who after a short and very happy, but childless marriage, was widowed in 1811. In 1820 she remarried Colonel Henrik Christian Rosenoern. Now in possession of the Guldborgland Barony, Colonel Henrik Christian Rosenoern was given the title \\"baron\\" with the name Rosenoern-Lehn for him and his descendants to bear.  Abandonment of the House as a Family House  Christiane Henriette had previously decided to move the headquarters of the Barony of Guldborgland to the more beautifully situated Oreby Estate and to restore the rather rundown castle there. To carry this out, Poul Lehn's will, in which he had had set aside a considerable sum of money to restore Berritzgaard's big detached wing, had to be changed. This was successful and Berritzgaard was abandoned in 1810 as living quarters for the Rosenoern-Lehn family and was not used as a family house for the next 160 years. Berritzgard in 1874 The house was left only partly furnished, now and then occupied by staff in the lower part of the house. The run down wing that was supposed to be restored was instead demolished, and Hans van Steenwinckel's fine house was allowed to stand untouched by changing architectural fashions. Occasionally the house was used for other purposes. In 1864 it was used as a hospital during the Danish- Prussian War, and just after World War I it was used as a refugee camp. In 1940-1943 the Danish army had a garrison that was taken over by the German occupation forces. From 1945 to 1949 the house and the grounds were used as a refugee camp for East Germans. In the 1950s, a rug factory was operated on the grounds. Much of the land surrounding the estate were lost in the land redistribution in Denmark that took place in 1919-1921. Many large estates were broken into small plots and leased to farmers through the Danish government.  Renovations of the House and Grounds  One of the larger known renovations of Berritzgaard was in the 1890s where the existing leaded lights were added to mimic the Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen and the windows on the first floor were shortened so they would \\"stand\\" on the decorative limestone border, which is set into the redbrick wall all around the house. During the same renovation, several blinded windows were re-established. The house was kept in basic repair until 1970 where Christiane Henriette's great- great grandchild (the present owner) converted the house to his private residence with a general restoring and refurnishing of the house. In the 1950s the public road \\"Kogangen\\" was moved from its immediate position north of the house to its present southern location between the house and the farm-building complex thus combining the gardens north and south of the house. At the same occasion the fragmented moat system was cleaned up and extended and a new moat was dug where the public road had run, thus combining the fragments. The old baroque garden north of the house was cleared of younger tree avenues and a fruit garden thus making room for the original double driveway avenue of lime trees planted sometimes in mid-18th century. This avenue frames the garden room beautifully and by making a \\"false\\" perspective gives an impression of a far view in an otherwise completely flat landscape.  Complete Renovation and Reestablishment as a Private Residence  The tiled roof was restored in the mid 1970s and during the last 30 years the house has been fully restored in respect to the national listing of historic places underwhich the house is placed. The house is a private residence and is not open to the public.

The show entailed a group of sensual and tempting sirens engaging with a band of renegade pirates led by the infamous Blackbeard.  Story  The show opens with Siren leader \\"Sin\\" Cinnamon narrating a warning about their power over the sea. Soon afterwards, the adventuring pirate Eros boards the Siren ship The Song, after which he is discovered and overwhelmed by its crew. Eros is bound to the mast and demands his release, threatening the Sirens with the wrath of Captain Mack.

The Sirens exchange greetings with the \\"salty crew\\" of The Bull and Eros asks his crewmates to leave, as he is happy with his new arrangement. The pirates first fire a warning shot across the bow of The Song, and then fire on the warehouse behind the Sirens' ship, which holds their closet. In retaliation, the Sirens use their power over the ocean to summon a storm to engulf The Bull and sink it to the bottom of the sea.

The Sirens force Eros to walk the plank, but he and the rest of the pirates soon climb aboard The Song, where a second battle ensues. As the pirates finally realize they're no match for the Sirens, they decide to surrender and the deck of The Song turns into a 21st-century party.

The Battle of Buccaneer Bay (in some sources, The Pirate Battle of Buccaneer Bay at Treasure Island) ran for 16,334 shows.  History  Aerial view from The Venetian, July 2011. The Song (Sirens' ship) is on the left and The Bull (pirate ship) is on the right, separated by a plank pier/walkway In October 2003, The Sirens of TI replaced The Battle of Buccaneer Bay, which was geared towards a younger audience\\"Sirens of TI: 5 years of pirates and pyrotechnics,\\" 24/7 Magazine (Las Vegas), October 2008, p. 34. and had been playing since Treasure Island opened on October 27, 1993. Director and choreographer Kenny Ortega created The Sirens of TI show, inspired by Homer's Odyssey. Songwriter Emilio Estefan prepared the score and Travis Payne handled show choreography. The show commemorated its fifth anniversary on October 21, 2008 when the street leading into the hotel/casino property was renamed from \\"Buccaneer Boulevard\\" to \\"Sirens Cove Boulevard.\\"\\"Treasure Island Unveils New Street Sign,\\" Las Vegas Tribune, October 29, 2008, page D-1. At that time, the show was presented four times daily, at 7, 8:30, 10 and 11:30 p.m. Beginning November 3, 2008, the show was presented at 5:30, 7, 8:30 and 10 p.m. daily.\\"LasVegas2Go\\" magazine, October 26, 2008, p. 18. Siren Cove is drained but the boats remain in June 2014 On October 20, 2013, the show was halted for what was intended to be a temporary closure until December 26, for the construction of retail space nearby. However, in late November 2013, Treasure Island announced that the closure was permanent, and that some of the space would be used for new shops, surprising several cast members. The new shopping mall reduced the size of Sirens Cove by approximately one-third, and while the ships still exist, the Bull no longer moves (The Song never moved). The cove now features several water fountains, and no show replaced the Sirens of TI. Statistics The show featured a cast of sixteen sirens and fourteen pirates. When it started, the cast consisted of thirteen sirens and eleven pirates. It was estimated to cost $5 million per year. More than eighty individual pieces of pyrotechnics were shot per show. Flame effects consumed of liquid propane per show. The sound system had more than 40,000 watts of power. The lagoon contained approximately of reverse-osmosis filtered and reclaimed water, which was deep at many points, extending to depths of at two pits.Jennifer Prosser, \\"Siren Songs: The Sexy Female Pirates Celebrate Five Years of Working Their Wiles at Treasure Island,\\" 'Where Las Vegas Magazine,' October 2008, pp. 88-89. By 2011, over the course of 7,440 shows, 630,000 pieces of pyrotechnics had been detonated, of propane had been fired, and The Bull had traveled (The Song never moved). Sirens flank their leader, \\"Sin\\" (Jan 2009) The original runtime for the show was 28 minutes. Dialogue and choreography tweaks shortened it to 18 minutes by 2005 to better match the patience of the standing crowd. The attendance for the premiere showing at 6 p.m. on October 26, 2003 was estimated at 5,000, double the standing capacity of 2,500; during the premiere, the crowd spilled from the sidewalk onto Las Vegas Boulevard, forcing the closure of several lanes. It had been viewed by more than 10 million over 4,749 performances by 2008, and nearly 17 million over 7,440 performances by 2011. Reception Soon after its premiere, Martin Stein wrote \\"Sirens is foundering and taking on water\\" in his review for the Las Vegas Weekly, adding \\"the choreography is boring [and] all the action is far too small for a show in which the audience will often be across six lanes of traffic.\\" Readers of the Las Vegas Review-Journal voted it the worst local attraction in 2004 and 2005. The Los Angeles Times advised readers to avoid the show, calling it \\"dumb and a major pain to watch.\\" Despite the negative feedback, the Las Vegas Weekly later collectively named \\"Sirens\\" and its pirate show predecessor \\"Buccaneer Cove\\" the eighth-greatest attraction in Las Vegas history in 2017. It was also named a \\"must-see\\" by Michelin.

Eaton (born 1950) is a former United States Army officer most known for his command of operations to train Iraqi troops during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Eaton served in that capacity between 2003 and 2004, and then returned to the US to become Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Training, United States Army Training and Doctrine Command, Fort Monroe, Virginia. He previously served as Senior Adviser to the now-defunct National Security Network, a progressive Washington, D.C.-based think tank that focused on foreign policy and defense issues. Early life and education Eaton was raised in Oklahoma. His father, U.S. Air Force Colonel Norman Dale Eaton, graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 1949 and went on to become a U.S. Air Force pilot. He was piloting a B-57B when it crashed on a night interdiction mission over Salavan Province, Laos on 13 January 1969 and he and the other crewman, Paul E. Getchell, were listed as missing in action for many years. His remains were recovered, identified and buried at Arlington National Cemetery in early 2007. Eaton followed in his father's footsteps to West Point in 1968, graduating with the class of 1972. He is fluent in French, receiving a Master of Arts from Middlebury College in French and Political Science. Career As a lieutenant and captain, Eaton served in the 4th Infantry Division, Fort Carson, Colorado, and was later transferred to Germany as part of 4th Brigade, 4th Infantry Division (\\"Brigade 76\\"), where he served as an assistant brigade S3 (operations) officer and later was an infantry company commander. As major and lieutenant colonel Eaton was assigned to key battalion and brigade staff positions in the old 9th Infantry Division, then on the I Corps staff. He also commanded the 3rd Battalion, 14th Infantry, 2nd Brigade of the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, New York, and later served as the G-3 (operations officer) of the division during Operation Restore Hope in Somalia. As a colonel in the mid 1990s he commanded an Army brigade in Germany and following promotion to brigadier general was the assistant division commander of the 1st Armored Division. In 2000, he returned to the U.S. to serve as deputy commanding general of the U.S. Army Infantry Center and School at Fort Benning, Georgia, and later he led the creation of the Army's new Stryker brigades at Fort Lewis, Washington. As a major general he returned to Fort Benning to be commanding general of the Army Infantry Center and School. He was then assigned to Iraq as Commanding General of the Coalition Military Assistance Training Team (CMATT), where he was in charge of training the Iraqi military from 2003 to 2004.U.S. Army General Dubbed Father of the Iraqi Army Following the first Iraqi army battalion's graduation, their first mission received heavy casualties and raised questions about the efficacy of Iraqi soldiers trained under U.S. supervision. During an initial mission in April 2004 to assist U.S. Marines in Fallujah and under the supervision of a Marine advisory team, the Iraqi soldiers ran from the scene when they first were attacked by insurgents. \\"The convoy got stalled when one of the IAF soldiers driving one of the trucks simply jumped out and ran, leaving the truck running. This truck struck a civilian vehicle, creating a jam that prevented part of the convoy from moving. About 30 Iraqi soldiers were lost in this ambush. Some simply ran away, some sold their AK-47s and donned civilian clothes, and some had civilian clothes under their uniforms, so they simply took off their uniforms and ran.\\" The Marine advisors managed to salvage the convoy and get them to safety, but with significant casualties. What was a battalion of 695 Iraqi soldiers has been reduced significantly with 30 casualties in the ambush, alongside 8 wounded, 24 combat deserters, 104 mutineers, 78 AWOL (absent without leave) and 170 on leave. This stands in contrast to the support of Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, the senior U.S. commander in Iraq, whose remarks during the Iraqi battalion's graduation spoke of \\"high expectations that in fact they would help us bring security and stability back to the country.\\" Upon return to the US he was Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Training, United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Fort Monroe, Virginia.

Victor) O'Brien (later president of the Pittsburgh National Bank), in cafes and supper clubs in the Pittsburgh area. She studied singing in Los Angeles with Alexis Bassian and Lotte Lehmann. By the age of twenty she was singing on Hollywood film soundtracks and it was there that she was spotted by Laurence Olivier. He picked Merriman to accompany him and his wife, actress Vivien Leigh, on a tour of Romeo and Juliet, where she performed songs during the set changes. Her voice was used in two Jeanette MacDonald movies, first in a chorus in Maytime (1937),https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029222/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast then in a brief solo early in Smilin' Through (1941).https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034203/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast Merriman sang many roles both live and on radio under the baton of Arturo Toscanini between 1944 and 1953, while he was conductor of the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Among the roles she sang with him, were Maddalena in Act IV of Verdi's Rigoletto, Emilia in Verdi's Otello, Mistress Page in Verdi's Falstaff, and the trousers role of Orfeo in Act II of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice and also sang in his first and only studio recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, in 1952. She was also featured as Dorabella in a 1956 La Scala performance of Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte, which was conducted by Toscanini's short-lived prot√©g√©, Guido Cantelli. Merriman was the first singer to record Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde twice, recording it on both occasions with the tenor Ernst Haefliger and the Concertgebouw Orchestra. The 1957 recording was conducted by Eduard van Beinum for the Philips label, while the 1963 recording was conducted by Eugen Jochum for Deutsche Grammophon (see discography in the external links). The latter recording was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque of the Acad√©mie Charles Cros. Merriman was particularly well received in the Netherlands, where she met and married Dutch tenor Tom Brand, a widower with several children. She retired from performing to care for the family in 1965. Brand died in 1970. After the children were grown, she maintained residences in Hawaii and California. She died at her home in Los Angeles on July 22, 2012 from natural causes, aged 92.

While the term has no negative connotations in older dictionaries,Fowler's Dictionary of English Usage, 1956 and the usage of such compound terms as Englishman, Frenchman and IrishmanEnglishman has two plurals: (the) English, when speaking of the nation, and Englishmen when speaking of individuals. The same remark applies to: Dutchman, Frenchman, Scotsman, Welshman, and Cornishman. Chinese is now rarely used as a singular, the compound Chinaman taking its place. A manual of English pronunciation and grammar for the use of Dutch students By J. H. A. G√ºnther, p144 are sometimes cited as unobjectionable parallels,Oxford American Dictionary the term is noted as offensive by modern dictionaries. Its derogatory connotations evolved from its use in pejorative contexts regarding Chinese people and other Asians as well as its grammatical incorrectness which resembles stereotypical characterizations of Chinese accents in English-speaking associated with discrimination.Arslan, L. M., & Hansen, J. H. (1996). Language accent classification in American English. Speech Communication, 18(4), 353-367.Cargile, A. C. (1997). Attitudes toward Chinese-accented speech: An investigation in two contexts. Journal of language and social psychology, 16(4), 434-443.Kim, S. Y., Wang, Y., Deng, S., Alvarez, R., & Li, J. (2011). Accent, perpetual foreigner stereotype, and perceived discrimination as indirect links between English proficiency and depressive symptoms in Chinese American adolescents. Developmental Psychology, 47(1), 289. While usage of the term Chinaman is nowadays strongly discouraged by Asian American organizations, it has also been used as a self-referential archetype by authors and artists of Asian descent. It may have come from literal translation into English of the Chinese term for \\"Chinese man/person\\", ‰∏≠Âúã‰∫∫ (Zh≈çnggu√≥ r√©n) = \\"China man/person\\". Historic usage= Use in the United States  The term Chinaman has been historically used in a variety of ways, including legal documents, literary works, geographic names, and in speech. Census records in 19th century North America recorded Chinese men by names such as \\"John Chinaman\\", \\"Jake Chinaman\\", or simply as \\"Chinaman\\". Chinese American historian Emma Woo Louie commented that such names in census schedules were used when census takers could not obtain any information and that they \\"should not be considered to be racist in intent\\". One census taker in El Dorado County wrote, \\"I found about 80 Chinese men in Spanish Canion who refused to give me their names or other information.\\" Louie equated \\"John Chinaman\\" to \\"John Doe\\" in its usage to refer to a person whose name is not known, and added that other ethnic groups were also identified by generic terms as well, such as Spaniard and Kanaka, which refers to a Hawaiian. In a notable 1853 letter to Governor of California John Bigler which challenges his proposed immigration policy toward the Chinese, restaurant owner Norman Asing, at the time a leader in San Francisco's Chinese community, referred to himself as a \\"Chinaman\\". Addressing the governor, he wrote, \\"Sir: I am a Chinaman, a republican, and a lover of free institutions.\\" Chinaman was also often used in complimentary contexts, such as \\"after a very famous Chinaman in old Cassiar Rush days, (who was) known & loved by whites and natives\\".British Columbia Geographical Names Information System, \\"Ah Clem Creek\\" As the Chinese in the American West began to encounter discrimination and hostile criticism of their culture and mannerisms, the term would begin to take on negative connotations. The slogan of the Workingman's Party was \\"The Chinese Must Go!\\", coined in the 1870s before chinaman became a common derogatory term. The term Chinaman's chance evolved as the Chinese began to take on dangerous jobs building the railroads or ventured to exploit mine claims abandoned by others, and later found themselves victims of injustice as accused murderers (of Chinese) would be acquitted if the only testimony against them was from other Chinese. Legal documents such as the Geary Act of 1892, which barred the entry of Chinese people to the United States, referred to Chinese people both as \\"Chinese persons\\" or \\"Chinamen\\".  Use on Japanese People  The term has also been used to refer to Japanese men, despite the fact that they are not Chinese. The Japanese admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç, during his training in England in the 1870s, was called \\"Johnny Chinaman\\" by his British comrades. Civil rights pioneer Takuji Yamashita took a case to the United States Supreme Court in 1922 on the issue of the possibility of allowing Japanese immigrants to own land in the state of Washington. Washington's attorney general, in his argument, stated that Japanese people could not fit into American society because assimilation was not possible for \\"the Negro, the Indian and the Chinaman.\\"  Literary Use  Literary and musical works have used the term as well. In \\"Disgraceful Persecution of a Boy\\", an 1870 essay written by Mark Twain, a sympathetic and often flattering account about the circumstances of Chinese people in 19th- century United States society, the term is used throughout the body of the essay to refer to Chinese people. Over a hundred years later, the term would again be used during the Civil Rights era in the context of racial injustice in literary works. The term was used in the title of Chinese American writer Frank Chin's first play, The Chickencoop Chinaman, written in 1972, and also in the translated English title of Bo Yang's work of political and cultural criticism The Ugly Chinaman and the Crisis of Chinese Culture. During the 1890s detective fiction often portrayed Chinese characters as stereotypically conniving, tending to use the term \\"Chinaman\\" to refer to them. This occurred to such a great extent that it prompted writers of the 1920s and 1930s (during Britain's Golden Age of Detective Fiction) to eschew stereotypical characterizations, either by removing them from their stories entirely (as suggested by Ronald Knox in his \\"Ten Commandments\\" of Detective Fiction) or by recasting them in non-stereotypical roles. This \\"Rule of Rule Subversion\\" became an important part of Golden Age detective fiction, challenging readers to think more critically about characters using only information given in the story. In musical works, the term appears in Mort Shuman's 1967 translation of the Jacques Brel song \\"Jacky\\": \\"Locked up inside my opium den / Surrounded by some Chinamen.\\" (The phrase used in Brel's original French lyric was vieux Chinois, meaning \\"old Chinese\\".) The term was also used in the hit 1974 song Kung Fu Fighting, by Carl Douglas; the song's first verse begins \\"They were funky Chinamen from funky Chinatown.\\" Modern usage The term Chinaman is described as being offensive in most modern dictionaries and studies of usage. It is not, however, as offensive as chink. The New Fowler's Modern English Usage considers Chinaman to have a \\"derogatory edge\\", The Cambridge Guide to English Usage describes it as having \\"derogatory overtones\\", and Philip Herbst's reference work The Color of Words notes that it may be \\"taken as patronizing\\". This distinguishes it from similar ethnic names such as Englishman and Irishman, which are not used pejoratively. In its original sense, Chinaman is almost entirely absent from British English, and has been since before 1965. Fowler and Burchfield derive the date of 1965 from However, chinaman (not capitalized) is still used in an alternative sense to describe a left-arm unorthodox spin bowler in cricket. Most British dictionaries see the term Chinaman as old-fashioned, and this view is backed up by data from the British National Corpus. According to Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage, in American English Chinaman is most often used in a \\"knowing\\" way, either satirically or to evoke the word's historical connotations. It acknowledges, however, that there is still some usage that is completely innocent. In addition, Herbst notes in The Color of Words that despite Chinaman's negative connotations, its use is not usually intended as malicious. Controversy The use of the term Chinaman in public platforms and as names of geographical locations has been the occasion of several public controversies in recent times. On April 9, 1998, television sitcom show Seinfeld aired an episode in which a character referred to opium as \\"the Chinaman's nightcap\\". The episode prompted many Asian American viewers, including author Maxine Hong Kingston, to send letters of protest. In her letter, Kingston wrote that the term is \\"equivalent to niggers for blacks and kikes for Jews\\". Media watchdog Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) called on NBC, broadcasting network for the show, to issue a public apology. NBC did not issue an apology, but it removed the offending term from the episode in the episode's rerun in May 1998. NBC's executive vice president for broadcast standards and content policy sent MANAA a letter stating that the network never intended to offend. MANAA was pleased with the studio's response despite the lack of an apology, and Kingston, while disappointed there was no apology, was pleased that the term was removed from the episode. On July 7, 1998, Canada's province of Alberta renamed a peak in the Rocky Mountains from \\"Chinaman's Peak\\" to \\"Ha Ling Peak\\" due to pressure from the province's large Chinese community. The new name was chosen in honour of the railroad labourer who scaled the peak's -high summit in 1896 to win a $50 bet to commemorate all his fellow Chinese railway labourers. Ha Ling himself had named it \\"Chinaman's Peak\\" on behalf of all his fellow Chinese railway workers. In 2001, the Chicago Sun-Times was chastised by William Yashino, Midwest director of the Japanese American Citizens League, for using the term Chinaman in two of its columns. Yashino wrote, in a letter to the editor on May 16, 2001, that the term is derogatory and demeaning to Chinese Americans and Asian Americans, and that it marginalizes these communities and inflames public sentiment. In March 2007, media mogul Ted Turner used the term in a public speech before the Bay Area Council of San Francisco, California. Community leaders and officials objected to his use of the term, and immediately called for an apology. In a statement released by his spokesman on March 13, 2007, Turner apologized for having used the term, stating that he was unaware that the term was derogatory. Vincent Pan, director of the organization Chinese for Affirmative Action, said it was \\"a bit suspect\\" for someone involved in domestic and world politics like Turner to be unaware that the term is derogatory. Yvonne Lee, a former commissioner of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, said the apology was the first step, but wanted Turner to agree to further \\"dialogue between different communities\\". On April 11, 2008, golf announcer Bobby Clampett apologized for referring to golfer Liang Wen- Chong as \\"the Chinaman\\" during the Masters golf tournament at Augusta National Golf Club. Clampett, working the Internet broadcast of Amen Corner, made the comment after Liang missed the cut. According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Clampett was taken off the broadcast after the comment. Ching Chong Chinaman production photo In 2010, the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre released a statement explaining their decision to produce a play by Lauren Yee titled Ching Chong Chinaman, a term which has at times been used in doggerel verse with racist overtones. Artistic Producing Director Tisa Chang explained that \\"Ching Chong Chinaman takes its controversial title from the late 19th century pejorative jingle and uses irony and satire to reverse prejudicial attitudes towards Asians and other outsiders.

The school was founded in 1967 and serves 1,662 students in grades 9 to 12. The school's mascot is the Blue Raider, and its school colors are blue, white, and red. The principal is Autumn O'Bryan. The school maintains a rivalry with the crosstown Bradley Central High School, as with their other crosstown rival Walker Valley High School.  History  Cleveland High School is located on the site of the home of Jesse Bushyhead (1804-1844), a Cherokee religious and political leader. In the late 1950s, a group of Cleveland citizens began working for a city high school. The first step was taken when a ninth grade was added to Arnold Junior High, now an elementary school. On May 12, 1965 voters passed a referendum that allowed for the issuing of $2 million in bonds for construction of the new high school. The new school was completed in 1966, and in September of that year a historic walk took place from Arnold to the new high school to start the first year of school at CHS. Every year during homecoming week, a parade is held on Raider Drive to commemorate the anniversary of this historic walk. Former principals include James Traylor, Jim Sharp, T.C. Henley, Charles Carrick, Maxine Hughes, Doug Greene, Ken Willey, and Chuck Rockholt. In 1971 Cleveland Junior High, which later became Cleveland Middle School, opened in a building adjacent to the high school at a cost of $2.1 million. A new building was added on to the school to add extra career prep courses in 1980.Timeline of CHS Events, Cleveland High School A renovation of the football field area took place in 1987. A new metal structure for the home stands was constructed on the opposite side of the field and a field house was built. The Jones Wrestling Center was built in 2001 after Check Into Cash founder and class of 1972 alumni Allan Jones donated $1.5 million for its construction. Jones wrestled while at CHS. Also that year Cleveland Middle School moved to a new location, and the middle school building was adjoined to the original high school building, becoming the west wing of the high school and adding a \\"commons area\\" in between the two buildings in an $8.7 million project. A new $8 million science wing was built in 2011. The wing is named the Max R. Carroll Science Wing in honor of a member of the Cleveland Board of Education who donated money for the project. The state provided funding for the expansion as well. This project had been proposed since 2005.Cleveland High School opens science wing August 3, 2011 In December 2013, the Raider Dome, which was used as the school's main gymnasium was closed due to faults in the structure. The dome had always had structural problems since it was built in 1966. In May 2014, the school board voted to award a $319 thousand contract to demolish the dome. The dome was demolished the following month. A new $11 million gymnasium, dubbed the \\"Raider Arena,\\" opened in April 2016. In 2017 the school installed artificial turf on the football field.  Academics  *Cleveland offers 11 advanced placement (AP) courses and 5 dual enrollment courses. *Cleveland also offers Early Admissions courses, which can be taken at Cleveland State or Lee University. *Cleveland offers three foreign languages: Spanish, German, and French. English as a second language is also offered to non-native English speakers. *Cleveland offers career and technical education for a variety of fields, including digital media, engineering, healthcare, business/marketing, criminal justice, automotive, culinary arts, and cosmetology. The school has expanded its AP program over the last five years, adding new classes and preparing students for the exams, with a goal of increasing the number of students scoring 4s and 5s. As a result, the class of 2016 had the school's first AP Scholars since 2003, and the first AP Scholars with Honor and AP Scholars with Distinction in the school's history. In 2016, CHS was named to the 7th annual AP Honor Roll.  CHS Live  CHS Live or CHSLive is the school's digital media/broadcasting program, begun in the 2000s. Students in this program record and broadcast major events and a daily news show for students at the school through the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) network. The program was awarded the NFHS Network's Best Overall School Broadcast Program at the NFHS convention in 2015, and the \\"Best Daily Newscast in the Nation\\" by the Student Television Network (STN) in 2016 and 2017, breaking an eight-year streak of Carlsbad High School in California.

It provides programming to approximately 75 radio stations, primarily in the state of North Carolina, and can also be heard by Internet streaming via its website. History The roots of this network go back to 1942, when WRAL (1240 AM; now WPJL) in Raleigh, North Carolina began producing agricultural reports for farmers in the Eastern part of the state. Shortly after returning from service in World War II, Ray Wilkinson began delivering agricultural reports in Rocky Mount, North Carolina on radio station WCEC 810 AM (now dark), where he was Program Director. Shortly thereafter, WRAL expressed interest in broadcasting Wilkinson's reports, and the groundwork was laid for the foundation of the Tobacco Radio Network, the predecessor to NCNN. The network was so-named because tobacco was the leading agricultural crop in Eastern North Carolina, where the oldest stations of the network were based. With the establishment of WRAL-FM in 1946, the network took advantage of its static-free reception and wide coverage area to begin relaying programming to other stations that desired agricultural news. Eventually, the network was available to nearly all of North Carolina through a system of FM repeater stations. Feeder stations for the network included: *WRAL-FM/101.5, Raleigh ‚Äî Main origination station *WCEC-FM/100.7, Rocky Mount (now WRDU) ‚Äî Eastern Zone feeder station *WGBR-FM/97.7, Goldsboro (now WZKT) ‚Äî Southeastern Zone feeder station *WGWR-FM/92.3, Asheboro (now WKRR) ‚Äî Central Zone feeder station *WEGO-FM/97.9, Concord (now WPEG) ‚Äî Western Zone feeder station A companion network, the Tobacco Sports Network, was formed in the mid 1950s to broadcast College Football and College Basketball for the four major universities centered in and around Raleigh. Broadcast commentators for events on this network included Bill Currie and Ray Reeve. It was this network that broadcast the North Carolina Tar Heels‚Äô winning game in the 1957 NCAA basketball championship to a statewide audience. In 1963, Wilkinson became Farm News Director for WRAL, and the programming he was producing for the network went to Raleigh with him. He became Vice- President of Capitol Broadcasting Company, in charge of both networks, a position he held for 31 years. With Wilkinson's move to WRAL, operations for the two networks were consolidated by Capitol Broadcasting and renamed the T-N Radio Network. A news staff was hired, and hourly newscasts were begun. During the 1960s, the distinctive three-note news sounder could regularly be heard at 55 minutes past the hour on radio stations across North Carolina. In 1973, concurrent with programming changes at parent station WRAL-FM, the network was re-imaged to the current \\"North Carolina News Network\\" for news, weather and sports reports, while agricultural reports continued as \\"T-N Farm News.\\" By 1978, the network had discontinued the FM feeder station distribution, and was carried by telephone lines as a conventional network. That change would only be temporary, as Capitol Broadcasting began satellite distribution of NCNN in 1983. The satellite bandwidth provided to NCNN by Capitol Satellite Services allowed the network to re-enter Sports Broadcasting in a big way in the 1990s, offering distribution services for North Carolina State University and Duke University games, and those of the NBA Charlotte Hornets. In recent years, NCNN has become available to listeners worldwide by streaming audio on the internet. On August 10, 2009 NCNN owners Capitol Broadcasting Company announced the sale of the network to Curtis Media Group, also of Raleigh. Curtis owns stations in the Raleigh Market, as well as station groups in Wilmington, Goldsboro, Burlington, Winston-Salem and Boone. Programming As T-N, the network developed some programming distinctive to North Carolina interests. Being based in Raleigh, the state capital, much of the network's programming dealt with legislative and other governmental activities. A group of stringer reporters informed T-N Network listeners of news from other areas of the state. Statewide and regional weather reports were a fixture on the T-N Network, and daily sports reports dealt almost exclusively with North Carolina high school and college teams. Daily editorials by WRAL-TV commentator Jesse Helms were broadcast on the T-N Network, and are generally credited as a major contributing factor to his winning election to the U.S. Senate in 1972. Since becoming NCNN, the network has expanded coverage of high school sports in North Carolina, becoming the major source for scores from football games across the state on Saturday mornings each fall. Coverage of the North Carolina Legislature has become more in-depth, with programs devoted to legislative coverage each year when the Legislature is in session. NCNN is known for giving extensive, regionalized forecasts for the entire state of North Carolina, prepared by a team of in-house meteorologists (which they share with WRAL-TV and WRAL-FM). Some of the current offerings of the North Carolina News Network include: Hourly Newscasts Five minutes of North Carolina news at :55 past each hour Sportscasts News of sporting events with a North Carolina angle air at :25 past the hour in mornings and afternoons.

History There is some doubt surrounding the provenance of the holotype and only known specimen (HUJI P4000, Hebrew University of Jerusalem), though it was likely recovered from the Judea Group, either from the upper Laminated Limestone Member of the Kefar Sha'ul Formation (Upper Cenomanian) or the lower member of the Bina Formation (Lower Turonian), based on an examination of the lithology of the limestone matrix and planktonic fossil foraminifera preserved in the same slab. Taxonomy and naming The genus is named for the Judean Hills where the holotype of Judeasaurus tchernovi was discovered (\\"Judea lizard\\"), and the etymology of the species name honours Eitan Tchernov for his contributions to the paleontology of Israel. Haber and Polcyn (2005, p. 249) diagnose Judeasaurus tchernovi as a varnoid lizard: Haber and Polcyn (2005, 251-254) compare Judeasaurus with other marine varanoids (Adriosaurus and Pontosaurus), basal mosasauroids (including Tethysaurus, Haasiasaurus, and Halisaurus) and with members of the paraphyletic Aigialosauridae, and determined that Judeasaurus \\"represents a new taxon within Varanoidea, related to mosasauroids based on its fused frontals and circular quadrate.\\" An affiliation with another group of Late Cretaceous marine varanoids, the Dolichosauridae, is proprosed but this relationship remains unresolved due to the poorly understood nature of dolichosaurs.

Biography He was a native of Clinton, Iowa, and studied for the priesthood at St. Mary‚Äôs Seminary in Baltimore, where he was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Davenport on June 12, 1912. He did graduate studies at The Catholic University of America in Washington, DC and the University of Iowa where he earned a doctorate. He was assigned to the faculty of St. Ambrose College after ordination. Cone was a social worker who taught social sciences at St. Ambrose for 16 years before becoming president. While serving at the college he was also pastor of St. Patrick‚Äôs parish in Villa Nova. Cone led the effort to bring Catholic Charities to the diocese in the late 1920s, and served as its first director from 1929 until his death in 1963. He had an interest in St. Vincent‚Äôs Home in Davenport where he helped to improve the living conditions of the children and professionalized the staff. As president at St Ambrose he took over at the beginning of the Great Depression. Cone is credited with building the faculty, taking over at a time when priests were paid $15 a month for teaching. Cone also instituted summer sessions on campus. He was also instrumental in developing a college for women in Davenport that would become Marycrest College. In the 1930s he worked with Msgrs. William Shannahan and George Giglinger to develop a local radio program on WOC that featured Catholic topics.Schmidt, 205 In 1937 he joined the board of the diocesan newspaper, The Catholic Messenger. Bishop Henry Rohlman nominated Father Cone for papal honors twice. In 1931 Pope Pius XI named him a Domestic Prelate. Pope Pius XII named him a Protonotary Apostolic in 1941.Schmidt, 350. After his presidency Msgr. Cone was appointed pastor and rector of Sacred Heart Cathedral, and vicar general of the Diocese of Davenport. When Bishop Rohlman became coadjutor archbishop of Dubuque in 1944, Msgr. Cone became administrator of the diocese until Bishop Ralph Leo Hayes was named Bishop of Davenport. In the 1940s he helped organize the diocese‚Äôs participation in the War Emergency and Relief Collection, which was sponsored by the National Catholic Welfare Council. He died in Davenport in 1963 at the age of 80.

Sturmgewehr 44 (Germany). Its development began in earnest with the Maschinenkarabiner project An intermediate cartridge is a rifle/carbine cartridge that is shorter than typical full-power battle rifle cartridges (such as the .303 British, 7.62√ó54mmR, 7.92√ó57mm Mauser, 7.7√ó58mm Arisaka, .30-06 Springfield or 7.62√ó51mm NATO), but still has greater length than pistol/personal defense weapon cartridges. As their recoil is significantly reduced compared to full-power rifle cartridges, fully automatic rifles firing intermediate cartridges are relatively easy to control. However, even though less powerful than a traditional full-power rifle cartridge, the ballistics are still sufficient for an effective range of , which are the maximum typical engagement ranges in modern combat. This allowed for the development of the assault rifle, a selective fire weapon that is more compact and lighter than rifles that fire full-power rifle cartridges. The first intermediate cartridge to see widespread service was the German 7.92√ó33mm Kurz used in the StG 44. Other examples include the Soviet 7.62√ó39mm M43 firstly used in the SKS semi- automatic carbine and AK-47 assault-rifle, and then the AKM series of assault- rifle, 5.45√ó39mm M74 introduced along with the AK-74 assault-rifle (officially replacing the AKM for front-line forces), and the Chinese 5.8√ó42mm used in the QBZ-95 series. History Many years before the Second World War started, small arms designers of the world noted that the power of the full-power rifle cartridge was seldom used to the full extent. The late 19th century and early 20th century saw the introduction of smokeless powder cartridges with small caliber jacketed spitzer bullets that extended the effective range of fire beyond the limitations of the open rifle sight lines. At and beyond, where these bullets were still lethal, a man-sized target would hide completely behind even the thinnest of front-sight blades. At great distance only large, soft-skinned area targets were vulnerable to rifle fire, and these were fired upon in salvos by whole units of riflemen. The Second World War saw the continued use of bolt-action rifles such as the Mauser Karabiner 98k, the Lee‚ÄìEnfield SMLE, the Mosin‚ÄìNagant, the Arisaka Type 38, and Type 99 rifles, and during the early years, the Springfield M1903, as well as semi-automatic battle rifles such as the M1 Garand, SVT-40, and the Gewehr 43. These rifles weighed over , and they were longer than and as such inappropriate for close combat. They fired cartridges capable out to over but typical combat ranges were much shorter, around , rarely exceeding . Therefore, the potential of the full-power rifle ammunition at longer ranges was seldom needed. For close quarter combat, all the major armies began employing submachine guns (Soviet PPSh-41, US Thompson M1928A1, British Sten and the German MP-40) which fired pistol cartridges. Compared with the battle rifles, these submachine guns could provide high rates of controllable fire, but they lacked the power and longer effective range of the battle rifles. In 1951 the US military published the M1 Garand's fire rate; a trained soldier averaged 40‚Äì50 accurate shots per minute at a range of . \\"At ranges over , a battlefield target is hard for the average rifleman to hit. Therefore, is considered the maximum effective range, even though the rifle is accurate at much greater ranges\\".U. S. RIFLE, CALIBER .30, M1, DEPARTMENTS OF THE ARMY AND THE AIR FORCE, October 1951 What was needed was a more compact, selective fire weapon (capable of switching between semi- and full-automatic fire), firing a cartridge combining the range and power of a rifle, with recoil nearly as low as a pistol cartridge. The resulting firearm would have the accuracy of the former (at least within expected typical combat ranges), but able to project the volume of fire of the latter at closer quarters. The first cartridge fulfilling this requirement may have been the Japanese 6.5√ó50mm Arisaka used by the Russian Fedorov Avtomat rifle since 1915 (the cartridge itself dates back to 1897). The Fedorov was arguably the first assault rifle. Later came the US M1 Carbine, which used the .30 Carbine cartridge and was developed as a weapon for officers and rear area soldiers unlikely to be involved in infantry assault but who needed a weapon more effective than a pistol. Soon after came the 7.92√ó33mm Kurz round developed by the Germans in 1938, which was a shortened version of the standard 7.92√ó57mm Mauser round, and was used in another candidate for first assault rifle, the StG-44. When the Soviets developed the AK-47, they already had an intermediate cartridge of their own. Since the 1960s the United States, NATO, the (former) Warsaw Pact, the People's Republic of China, and other countries adapted relatively small sized, light weight, high velocity military intermediate service cartridges in the form of the .223 Remington (1964), 5.56√ó45mm NATO (1980), Soviet 5.45√ó39mm (1974), and Chinese 5.8√ó42mm (1987). These intermediate cartridges allow a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight compared to their larger and heavier predecessor cartridges, have favourable maximum point-blank range or \\"battle zero\\" characteristics and produce relatively low bolt thrust and free recoil impulse, favouring light weight arms design and automatic fire accuracy.Assault Rifles and Their Ammunition: History and Prospects by Anthony G. Williams Universal service cartridge In 2017 some commercial (including 6.5 mm Creedmoor, 6.5 mm Grendel, .260 Remington) and other non-commercial such as .264 USA (6.5√ó48mm) cartridges are under consideration as universal service cartridges by some militaries. The universal service cartridge concept intends to replace small caliber high velocity intermediate cartridges and full-power cartridges with a cartridge at the larger end of the intermediate cartridge spectrum, well suited for both assault rifle and general purpose machine gun use in the 6mm caliber to 7mm caliber caliber range, with external and terminal ballistic performance close or equal to the 7.62√ó51mm NATO and 7.62√ó54mmR full-power cartridges. The .280 British (7√ó43mm) and Czech 7.62√ó45mm were early attempts to create universal service cartridges. The US Army is also testing telescoped ammunition, polymer-cased ammunition and caseless ammunition for future service cartridges. If major militaries will actually radically replace the intermediate and full-power service cartridge mix used by most 21st century militaries by a universal service cartridge remains an open question.

Among the DJs were Mike Harding, Alan Black, Pete Drummond, Annie Nightingale, John Peel (who alone had two shows per week), and Bob Harris. For contractual reasons one of Peel's two weekly shows was known as Top Gear, but the format and content of the show on every weekday were in essence identical for most of the early 1970s. Unlike most other Radio One programmes, Sounds of the Seventies concentrated on albums rather than singles, and rock rather than pop. Sessions recorded exclusively by the BBC and featuring major musicians of the day were a regular feature; the Musicians' Union insisted that \\"needle time\\"--time given to playing recorded music‚Äîshould be limited. In 1974 the Thursday show was replaced by a show without DJs known as the Thursday Night Sequence. Album tracks were played without interruption or introduction, and Pete Drummond gave the artist name, album name and track name after the piece. In early 1975 Sounds of the Seventies was dropped. In September of that year the loss of a nightly slot for progressive rock music was restored by the introduction of the nightly John Peel Show, which initially broadcast from 23:00 to 00:00. Peel carried on and expanded the practice of hosting exclusive sessions by major musicians. The Peel show format lasted until Peel's death in 2004. Theme tune The theme tune for the programme was usually a George Martin piece known as \\"Theme One\\", played in baroque style on a church organ. It was the version by Van der Graaf Generator. Martin had written the piece some years earlier as a theme tune for Radio 1. Variations included Mike Harding's use of the central guitar solo from \\"Heartbreaker\\" by Led Zeppelin, and Alan Black's regular closing theme, which was the piano and voice coda from \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\" by Procol Harum. Steve Harley: Sounds of the 70s In 2000 another programme with the name Sounds of the 70s, but unrelated to the original, began broadcasting on BBC Radio 2. Hosted by Steve Harley the 30 minute programme featured rock and pop tracks from the 1970s. In 2008 following several series the show was dropped from the Radio 2 schedule for a year. The last programme was aired on 27 March 2008. Johnnie Walker's Sounds of the 70s A new series of Sounds of the 70s began on Sunday 5 April 2009, broadcasting on BBC Radio 2. It runs from 3pm-5pm, and is hosted by former BBC Radio 1 DJ Johnnie Walker. There was also a BBC2 TV series called Sounds of the 70s which compiled 1970s performances from the BBC's music archives, taken from programmes such as Top of the Pops and The Old Grey Whistle Test.

The Canadian federal government and some provincial governments offer tax credits to LSVCC investors to promote the growth of such companies. History The idea behind LSVCCs was first proposed in the Canadian province of Quebec in 1982. The province was in the midst of a recession and the lack of capital in small and mid-sized companies had caused numerous bankruptcies. In response, the Quebec Federation of Labour proposed a Solidarity Fund at a provincial economic summit conference in 1982 to help the province create a locally controlled healthy and sustainable economy. The intention was to attract venture capital to smaller Quebec firms. This new type of fund slowly began to spread across the rest of Canada during the 1980s. But it wasn't until the late 1990s that LSVCCs became truly noteworthy outside Quebec, thanks in equal part to generous tax breaks from federal and provincial governments and attractive returns to investors. So far in the 2000s, returns have been less impressive, due in part to the bursting of the technology bubble. Returns for LSVCCs have generally been stagnant. Speculation about the reasons for low returns point to risky ventures, inexperienced fund managers, lack of requirement to generate positive returns to be competitive, and government intervention. Labour-sponsored venture capital corporations, as the name suggests, must be \\"sponsored\\" by a labour union. This sponsor is able to appoint members to the fund's board of directors (but not the investee's board of directors). Companies invested in LSVCC funds invest primarily in small and medium-sized private companies who require funding to sustain and increase growth. The emergence of the LSVCC industry stems from the idea that the growth of these firms will stimulate the Canadian economy and create jobs. The money investors put into these firms is a form of venture capital. These firms are just starting out and generally aren't listed on a stock exchange such as the Toronto Stock Exchange. LSVCCs offer an asset class that is normally not accessible through conventional investment vehicles. These companies have potential for substantial growth and high returns down the line if they succeed and are generally chosen precisely for that growth potential. In an LSVCC, as in any mutual fund, investors' money is distributed among a number of businesses. However, because the companies invested in by LSVCCs may be new and are likely small, many don't have much of a track record and can be risky investments by themselves. Ideally, an LSVCC can reduce that risk by diversifying their portfolio of assets. These small to mid-sized companies are interested in receiving financing from LSVCC fund companies because they are in a high growth cycle and are looking to further support the expansion of their business. These companies are often too small or too young to secure conventional bank financing. The LSVCC fund companies are also able to provide sought-after strategic guidance and operational support. Tax credits To encourage Canadian retail investors to invest in LSVCCs, the federal government and some provincial governments offer tax credits. The Canadian Federal budget tabled on March 22, 2016 restored the federal LSVCC credit to 15% for purchases of provincially (not federally) registered LSVCCs for the 2016 and later taxation years.http://www.cvca.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CVCA- Budget-2016-Statement.pdf Prior to 2015, the federal government had offered investors in LSVCCs a 15% tax credit on a maximum investment amount of $5,000 per year ‚Äì worth up to $750. That credit was reduced to 10% for 2015, 5% for 2016, and was to be eliminated for 2017 and later years. According to the Department of Finance, the federal LSVCC program has not had the same positive impact as the provincial programs, so the federal LSVCC credit for federally registered LSVCCs will remain at 5% for 2016 and will be eliminated for 2017 and later years; see the 2016 federal budget.http://www.budget.gc.ca/2016/home-accueil-en.html Some provinces offer a tax credit, often 15%, in addition to the federal credits. An additional 5% tax credit was formerly available to Ontario investors who purchased certain research-oriented LSVCC ‚Äì a kind of specialty LSVCC dealing mostly in research-oriented small companies. The Ontario government has phased out the labour-sponsored funds tax credit. As of January 1, 2012, the credit is no longer available from the Ontario government. When an investor buys an LSVCC in their RRSP, they obtain the LSVCC tax credits as well as the usual tax deduction they receive each time they contribute to their RRSP. Realizing gains Gains made in the value of LSVCCs occur in one of three ways: * Selling the investment in a company to a larger company (often in the same industry) by way of mergers and acquisitions. * Exiting from an investment in a company via an initial public offering. * Capital appreciation in currently held investments in a company. LSVCC fund companies tend to use their investment in a company to buy an equity stake. They will also negotiate to have members of their portfolio management team hold positions on the board of directors of companies they invest in. This allows them to have some say in future decisions that that company makes in regards to company strategy and execution. LSVCC funds have holding periods because of the time it takes for these small companies to meet the criteria necessary for one of the above- mentioned options. Even though the holding period is an extended period of time, the LSVCC fund company doesn't wish to retain any investment indefinitely. The primary objective of LSVCC fund managers is to obtain a superior rate of return through an eventual and timely disposition of each investment. Common characteristics ;Holding period:To retain the tax credit an investor has to hold on to the shares for a set time period, often eight years. If shares are sold before this time, the amount received in tax credits may need to be repaid to the government in what's termed tax credit clawback. ;Liquidity:Because of the nature of the holding period (often eight years), LSVCC shares usually can't be redeemed without paying penalty charges until the holding period is complete. Because of this decreased liquidity as compared with other investment instruments, LSVCCs are best for investors with longer time horizons who are able to hold their shares for the full holding period. ;Valuation:Like tradition LP-based venture capital funds, LSVCCs don't generally invest in publicly traded firms. With a stock that's publicly traded, the price that is quoted when the market closes is influenced by the opinions of investors, analysts and other market participants who have studied the company issuing the stock. Whereas LSVCC funds invest in private companies whose worth tends to be more difficult to assess and to determine. ;Risk:LSVCC fund companies are able to diversify their portfolio by investing in a relatively large number of firms thus decreasing overall risk. But this only holds to a certain degree. The companies have little track record and most are not publicly traded. Some will fail; others will stagnate. It‚Äôs the few that thrive that ideally provide the profit that makes up for the other losses. Criticism Government funds have come under criticism from non-Canadian sources for their relatively poor performance, as some of these funds lagged equity indices in the U.S. and Canada. Additionally, some government funds have been alleged to compete with private investment, potentially affecting the development of new companies in areas where they operate.

On October 1, 2018, TriWest's contract for VAPCCC was expanded to cover Regions 1, 2, and 4. History In 1996, TriWest Healthcare Alliance was established in order to compete for a U.S. Government contract to manage civilian health care benefits under the newly established TRICARE program within the 16-state TRICARE Central Region, also known as Regions 7 and 8. In 1996, TriWest was awarded the contract for the TRICARE Central Region and began operations. The TRICARE Central Region included the following states: * Arizona; * Colorado; * Southern Idaho; * Iowa; * Kansas; * Minnesota; * Missouri; * Montana; * Nebraska; * Nevada; * New Mexico; * North Dakota; * South Dakota; * El Paso, Texas; * Utah; and * Wyoming. TriWest was awarded an extension to this contract, which continued until 2004. On August 21, 2003, TriWest was awarded the TRICARE Managed Care Support Contract for the TRICARE West Region. The five-year contract, valued at approximately $10 billion, expanded TriWest's service area to 21 states and 2.7 million beneficiaries with the addition of Alaska, California, Hawaii, northern Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. On July 13, 2009, TriWest was awarded the contract (also known as the \\"T-3 contract\\") to continue providing military families access to health care and manage the 21-state TRICARE West Region for the Department of Defense (DoD). On March 16, 2012 it was announced that the T-3 West Region contract was awarded to Minnesota-based UnitedHealth Group. The contract was worth $20.5 billion On March 26, 2012 it was announced that TriWest will protest the Department of Defense award of the contract to UnitedHealth. David McIntyre (President and CEO of the TriWest Healthcare Alliance) cited the long history of performance and legal problems with the subsidiary which would handle the T-3 contract. On July 2, 2012 it was announced that TriWest lost its appeal to keep the West Region contract. In September 2011, TriWest paid $10 million to settle a Justice Department lawsuit after whistle-blowers claimed TriWest \\"systematically defrauded\\" Tricare by billing the government higher rates than they had negotiated with health care providers. The lawsuit also said TriWest sent 3,000 claims through one location a day to intentionally bypass checks to avoid late-payment fees and that it paid claims for ineligible beneficiaries.http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/arizona-based-triwest-healthcare- alliance-corp-agrees-pay-10-million-resolve-false-claims- acthttp://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2012-01-27/triwest- military-health-care-fraud/52908332/1 In September 2017, VA Inspector General Michael Missal issued a memorandum that listed four major ‚Äúerrors‚Äù that had resulted in excess payments to TriWest.

They gained notoriety not only for their surreal and smutty sense of humor, but also for their amalgamation of proto-punk, 1970s porn, pop, and avant-garde music. History The band formed in Los Angeles in 1977 with Black Randy (born John Morris, January 5, 1952) as frontman, David Brown on keyboards, and other members, including Pat Garrett, on guitar.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 13-14 However, the band had a rotating line-up, which even included live back-up singers known as the Blackettes which often included Exene Cervenka, Alice Bag, Lorna Doom, Belinda Carlisle, Jane Wiedlin, and featured several members of The Eyes.Uncle Dave Lewis \\"[ Black Randy & The Metrosquad Biography]\\", Allmusic, retrieved 2010-10-24 Black Randy's lyrics gave him a reputation for being as witty as he was offensive with songs about porn, Marlon Brando, and Idi Amin.Henderson, Alex \\"[ Pass the Dust, I Think I'm Bowie Review]\\", Allmusic, retrieved 2010-10-24 Their first single, \\"Trouble at the Cup\\", advocated fighting the police. He also covered James Brown's \\"Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud\\". The band also covered various porn music themes from the 70s. They released many vinyl singles and cassette tapes from 1977 onwards which were later compiled on an album called, Pass the Dust, I Think I'm Bowie, which had sophisticated and even innovative musical arrangements that had more in common with post-punk than hardcore bands like Black Flag. This album led to the band being the most represented act on Dangerhouse Records, the label established by Brown and Garrett. This was the label's only album release, though this was not due to nepotism, but rather to bands with major-label aspirations worrying that being associated with Black Randy's offensive songs could jeopardize their chances of being signed. The band appeared in Lou Adler's 1981 satirical punk rock film Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains, performing \\"I Slept in an Arcade\\".Robbins, Ira \\"Black Randy and the Metrosquad\\", Trouser Press, retrieved 2010-10-24 Pass the Dust... was reissued in 2004 by Sympathy for the Record Industry, and as a double LP by Vinyl Countdown Records in 2009, including the original album, the Dangerhouse singles, demos, live material, and a Black Randy phone call. Frontier Records reissued the album in 2016 on transparent pink vinyl, including a digital download with the non-LP Dangerhouse singles as bonus tracks, with a limited cassette edition co-released with Burger Records. The band imploded in mid-1982, when their frontman succumbed to drug and alcohol problems, which were evident in chaotic live shows, where songs were hardly sung and Brown tried, to no avail, to salvage the show. Black Randy died on November 11, 1988, of complications from AIDS. He was portrayed by Chris Pontius in the film What We Do Is Secret, a biopic of Darby Crash.

By 1940 the museum had moved to the second floor of the gymnasium (now the Theatre Playhouse). At that time the museum's collection included birds, various documents, minerals, wood specimens, shells, plant specimens, and Native American artifacts, among others. In 1990, the school received a donation of around 250 pieces of ancient, European, Middle Eastern, and Asian art from the Sponenburgh family. Alumnus Dan Schneider suggested to an art faculty member, Roger Hull, that the school should have a museum to display the university's art collection in 1992. Then in 1994 Roger Hull made a presentation to the school's trustees to push for the creation of an art museum. Over the next two years plans were developed and donations were made that led to the purchase of a building near campus for a museum. One large donation came from Hallie Ford and the Ford Family Foundation that allowed the purchase and remodel to move forward.Danilov, Victor J. 2005. Women and Museums: A Comprehensive Guide.

Optimality is measured with the Levenshtein distance, defined to be the sum of the costs of insertions, replacements, deletions, and null actions needed to change one string into the other. Hirschberg's algorithm is simply described as a more space efficient version of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm that uses divide and conquer.Hirschberg's algorithm Hirschberg's algorithm is commonly used in computational biology to find maximal global alignments of DNA and protein sequences. Algorithm information Hirschberg's algorithm is a generally applicable algorithm for optimal sequence alignment. BLAST and FASTA are suboptimal heuristics. If x and y are strings, where length(x) = n and length(y) = m, the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm finds an optimal alignment in O(nm) time, using O(nm) space. Hirschberg's algorithm is a clever modification of the Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm which still takes O(nm) time, but needs only O(min{n,m}) space and is much faster in practice.http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~rshamir/algmb/98/scribe/html/lec02/node10.html One application of the algorithm is finding sequence alignments of DNA or protein sequences. It is also a space-efficient way to calculate the longest common subsequence between two sets of data such as with the common diff tool. The Hirschberg algorithm can be derived from the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm by observing that: # one can compute the optimal alignment score by only storing the current and previous row of the Needleman-Wunsch score matrix; # if (Z,W) = \\\\operatorname{NW}(X,Y) is the optimal alignment of (X,Y), and X = X^l + X^r is an arbitrary partition of X, there exists a partition Y^l + Y^r of Y such that \\\\operatorname{NW}(X,Y) = \\\\operatorname{NW}(X^l,Y^l) + \\\\operatorname{NW}(X^r,Y^r).  Algorithm description  X_i denotes the i-th character of X, where 1 \\\\leqslant i \\\\leqslant \\\\operatorname{length}(X). X_{i:j} denotes a substring of size j-i+1, ranging from i-th to the j-th character of X. \\\\operatorname{rev}(X) is the reversed version of X. X and Y are sequences to be aligned. Let x be a character from X, and y be a character from Y. We assume that \\\\operatorname{Del}(x), \\\\operatorname{Ins}(y) and \\\\operatorname{Sub}(x,y) are well defined integer-valued functions. These functions represent the cost of deleting x, inserting y, and replacing x with y, respectively. We define \\\\operatorname{NWScore}(X,Y), which returns the last line of the Needleman-Wunsch score matrix \\\\mathrm{Score}(i,j): function NWScore(X, Y) Score(0,0) = 0 // 2 * (length(Y) + 1) array for j=1 to length(Y) Score(0,j) = Score(0, j - 1) + Ins(Yj) for i=1 to length(X) // Init array Score(1,0) = Score(0, 0) + Del(Xi) for j=1 to length(Y) scoreSub = Score(0, j - 1) + Sub(Xi, Yj) scoreDel = Score(0, j) + Del(Xi) scoreIns = Score(1, j - 1) + Ins(Yj) Score(1, j) = max(scoreSub, scoreDel, scoreIns) end // Copy Score[1] to Score[0] Score(0,:) = Score(1,:) end for j=0 to length(Y) LastLine(j) = Score(1, j) return LastLine Note that at any point, \\\\operatorname{NWScore} only requires the two most recent rows of the score matrix. Thus, \\\\operatorname{NWScore} is implemented in O(\\\\operatorname{min}{\\\\operatorname{length}(X),\\\\operatorname{length}(Y)}) space The Hirschberg algorithm follows: function Hirschberg(X, Y) Z = \\"\\" W = \\"\\" if length(X)  0 for i=1 to length(Y) Z = Z + '-' W = W + Yi end else if length(Y)  0 for i=1 to length(X) Z = Z + Xi W = W + '-' end else if length(X)  1 or length(Y)  1 (Z,W) = NeedlemanWunsch(X, Y) else xlen = length(X) xmid = length(X) / 2 ylen = length(Y) ScoreL = NWScore(X1:xmid, Y) ScoreR = NWScore(rev(Xxmid+1:xlen), rev(Y)) ymid = arg max ScoreL + rev(ScoreR) (Z,W) = Hirschberg(X1:xmid, y1:ymid) + Hirschberg(Xxmid+1:xlen, Yymid+1:ylen) end return (Z, W) In the context of Observation (2), assume that X^l + X^r is a partition of X. Index \\\\mathrm{ymid} is computed such that Y^l = Y_{1:\\\\mathrm{ymid}} and Y^r = Y_{\\\\mathrm{ymid}+1:\\\\operatorname{length}(Y)}.  Example  Let \\\\begin{align} X &= \\\\mathrm{AGTACGCA},\\\\ Y &= \\\\mathrm{TATGC},\\\\ \\\\operatorname{Del}(x) &= -2,\\\\ \\\\operatorname{Ins}(y) &= -2,\\\\ \\\\operatorname{Sub}(x,y) &= \\\\begin{cases} +2, & \\\\mbox{if } x = y \\\\ -1, & \\\\mbox{if } x eq y.\\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} The optimal alignment is given by W = AGTACGCA Z = --TATGC- Indeed, this can be verified by backtracking its corresponding Needleman-Wunsch matrix: T A T G C 0 -2 -4 -6 -8 -10 A -2 -1 0 -2 -4 -6 G -4 -3 -2 -1 0 -2 T -6 -2 -4 0 -2 -1 A -8 -4 0 -2 -1 -3 C -10 -6 -2 -1 -3 1 G -12 -8 -4 -3 1 -1 C -14 -10 -6 -5 -1 3 A -16 -12 -8 -7 -3 1 One starts with the top level call to \\\\operatorname{Hirschberg}(\\\\mathrm{AGTACGCA}, \\\\mathrm{TATGC}), which splits the first argument in half: X = \\\\mathrm{AGTA} + \\\\mathrm{CGCA}. The call to \\\\operatorname{NWScore}(\\\\mathrm{AGTA},Y) produces the following matrix: T A T G C 0 -2 -4 -6 -8 -10 A -2 -1 0 -2 -4 -6 G -4 -3 -2 -1 0 -2 T -6 -2 -4 0 -2 -1 A -8 -4 0 -2 -1 -3 Likewise, \\\\operatorname{NWScore}(\\\\operatorname{rev}(\\\\mathrm{CGCA}), \\\\operatorname{rev}(Y)) generates the following matrix: C G T A T 0 -2 -4 -6 -8 -10 A -2 -1 -3 -5 -4 -6 C -4 0 -2 -4 -6 -5 G -6 -2 2 0 -2 -4 C -8 -4 0 1 -1 -3 Their last lines (after reversing the latter) and sum of those are respectively ScoreL = [ -8 -4 0 -2 -1 -3 ] rev(ScoreR) = [ -3 -1 1 0 -4 -8 ] Sum = [-11 -5 1 -2 -5 -11] The maximum (shown in bold) appears at \`ymid = 2\`, producing the partition Y = \\\\mathrm{TA} + \\\\mathrm{TGC}. The entire Hirschberg recursion (which we omit for brevity) produces the following tree: (AGTACGCA,TATGC) / \\\\ (AGTA,TA) (CGCA,TGC) / \\\\ / \\\\ (AG, ) (TA,TA) (CG,TG) (CA,C) / \\\\ / \\\\ (T,T) (A,A) (C,T) (G,G) The leaves of the tree contain the optimal alignment.

In their nine-year career, the band released two full-length albums on Stomp Records and toured extensively throughout Canada and the United States. Career General Rudie was founded in February 1997 and their first concert was in March 1997, as the opening act at a Flashlight Brown concert (who were at that time called Flashlight). After playing together for three years, mostly in the Montreal area, they opened for The Skatalites in 2000. In the same year, the band performed in Toronto at Ska Ska Oi!, a punk/ska concert organized by the Toronto chapter of Anti Racist Action. They also performed at the Toronto International Jazz Festival. In the later part of 2000, General Rudie toured southern Ontario in support of their first EP The Green Light Sessions, Vol 1, including a performance at the Canadian Tulip Festival. The band had plans to tour the rest of Canada to support the EP, but according to singer Phil Dixon, the band \\"exploded and we spent the summer rebuilding\\". Instead, the band worked on establishing a solid line-up and writing new material. Stomp Records, Canada's largest ska record label, expressed an interest in signing General Rudie for a recording contract. The band began work on their first full-length release for Stomp in 2001, following a weeklong tour of the Canadian Maritimes with future label-mates and fellow Montr√©alers The Planet Smashers. The album, Cooling the Mark was completed by the end of the year. The official release party was at the 2002 Ska Ska Oi! concert. They also played the same ARA benefit in 2003, sharing the stage with Closet Monster and Nightshift. The release of their second album, Take Your Place, was in 2004. The album had 13 songs, including the single \\"Shelter\\", whose lyrics call for help for Montr√©al's homeless. The video for \\"Shelter\\" includes footage of squeegee kids and panhandlers interspersed with shots of the band performing in an abandoned building and under a highway overpass. The band performed what was to be a final concert on September 2, 2006 at the Cafe Campus in Montr√©al after a brief farewell tour through southern Ontario. However, in July and August 2014, the band reunited for four shows in Oshawa, Montreal, Quebec City, and Toronto. They were joined on the reunion tour by trombonist Patty Taylor of the Planet Smashers.

History The emporium was founded and run by Jay Ward, creator of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show (1959‚Äì73). The gift shop was located at 8200 Sunset Boulevard, a few yards from the former Jay Ward Productions (8218 Sunset Blvd.), the tiny studio building where the cartoons were produced, and across the street from the Chateau Marmont. The Dudley Do- Right Emporium opened in 1971 and closed its doors in April 2005. The shop was filled with toys, stuffed animals, trinkets, hats, t-shirts, wristwatches, original animation cels, cartoon scripts, recordings of TV themes, and assorted souvenirs, all bearing the likenesses of Dudley Do-Right, Rocky & Bullwinkle, Peabody and Sherman, Hoppity Hooper, George of the Jungle, Tom Slick, Super Chicken, Boris & Natasha, Snidely Whiplash and the other famous, wacky creations of Jay Ward Studios. In front of Jay Ward Productions was a statue of Bullwinkle J. Moose holding Rocky the Flying Squirrel. The statue was unveiled to the public at a kick-off party to commemorate \\"The Bullwinkle Show\\" joining NBC on September 24, 1961. Following Jay Ward's departure, the statue gradually fell into a state of disrepair and, in July 2013, was taken to DreamWorks Animation to be restored. When the restoration was completed, it was briefly displayed at the Paley Center in Beverly Hills. Since January 2015, it has been on display at the West Hollywood City Hall.

It is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for programming in Python supporting code refactoring, graphical debugging, code analysis among other features.  History  PyDev was originally created by Aleks Totic in July 2003, but Fabio Zadrozny became the project's main developer in January 2005. In September of that same year, PyDev Extensions was started as a commercial counterpart of PyDev, offering features such as code analysis and remote debugging. In July 2008, Aptana acquired PyDev, retaining Zadrozny as the project head. They open sourced PyDev Extensions in September 2009, and merged it with PyDev. When Appcelerator acquired Aptana in January 2011, they acquired PyDev by extension. Zadrozny was kept as head of the project. Since then, development of PyDev has accelerated. In March 2011, PyDev 2.0 was released with TDD actions support, and in April of the following year, version 2.5 was released with Django support. May 2013 saw a major milestone as PyDev raised more than its target in a successful crowd sourcing round to continue development, and version 2.7.5 was released. The campaign also funded Zadrozny's creation of LiClipse, a paid closed source fork of Eclipse which bundles PyDev by default. PyDev received improvements to type inference and a notable increase in contributions to code base when version 2.8 was released in July 2013. Since then, numerous additional improvements have been made to PyDev and it has gained many positive reviews. Version 5.4.0 was released on November 30, 2016. The main new feature of this release is support for Python 3.6.  Features  Below there are some of the features available (version 2.7.5): * CPython, Jython and IronPython support * Code completion * Code completion with auto- import * Code analysis (with quick-fix for problems found in code analysis‚ÄîCtrl+1) * Debugger * Django * Remote Debugger (allows debugging scripts not launched from within Eclipse) * Debug console (allows interactive probing in suspended mode) * Interactive console * Python 2.x and 3.x syntax * Basic syntax highlighting * Parser errors * Outline view * Tabs or spaces preferences * Smart indent / dedent * Comment / uncomment / comment blocks * Code folding * Go to definition * Code coverage * Mark occurrences * Pylint integration * TODO tasks * Content Assistants (Ctrl+1) ** Assign result to attribute or local ** Surround code with try..catch / finally ** Create docstring ** Move import to global scope * Keywords presented as auto- completions as you type * Quick-outline  PyDev extensions  Until September 2009, two versions of PyDev existed: an open-source version, and a shareware version called PyDev Extensions. Certain advanced features such as code analysis, quick-fixes, and remote debugging were reserved for the non-free version.

He was born in Mons, County of Hainaut, Southern Netherlands, and was executed at Valenciennes, aged 45. De Bres compiled and published the Walloon Confession of Faith known as the Belgic Confession (1561) (Confessio Belgica) still in use today in Belgium and the Netherlands. It is also used by many Reformed Churches all over the world.  Early life  Guido de Bres was born in Mons, today in southwestern Belgium. His father was formerly known as Jean Du Beguinage (alternatively: Jan le B√©guinage) was an itinerant blauschilder [lit. blue painter] which is indicative of the tin-glazed process, a precursor to Delftware, introduced into the Netherlands by Guido de Savino in 1512 at Antwerp. Jean changed his name to that of De Bres when he settled in Mons and with his wife bore five children: Jehan, Jherome, Christoffel, Guido and daughter Mailette. Rehalenbeck suggests one other son, Michel. De Bres was brought up by his mother, a devout Roman Catholic until the end of her days. The names of Guido's mother are unknown other than that of De Bres. Guido was a Roman Catholic and was very strong in that faith by all accounts. Not much is known of Guido's early life other than he followed his brother Jehan into school at the appropriate age and after a basic education followed his father in learning the craft of blauschilder. The De Bres family were known for their skills in glass painting, and young Guido was trained in this art before moving to England. In his teenage years, he became a follower of the Protestant religion as taught by Martin Luther. Later he converted to Calvinism. He met and studied under John Calvin at the academy of Geneva where Calvin taught.  Career Guido was converted between the age of 18 and 25. It is almost certain he became familiar with the Reformed faith through printed works. On 22 September 1540 a proclamation banned a large number of books: by Erasmus in Latin, Melanchthon, Eobanus Hessus and others, as well as the New Testament, the Gospels, the Epistles, and the Prophetical books of the Bible in French and Flemish. These books were deemed heretical by the Roman Catholic Church authorities. In 1543 books were burned in the marketplace of Lille: La Doctrines des Enfants (a Lutheran catechism), also Lamentations of Jesus Christ, La Sant Otraison and a book by a Flemish priest entitled: Letters Institution 2. In 1548, while Guido was still in Mons, he forged a friendship with an English couple: Mr. Nicholas and his wife. Mr Nicholas, his friend and two wives were caught by the authorities and charged with subversion of the Roman Catholic faith. They were imprisoned together with a number of Protestants from that area. Guy then fled to England, during the reign of Edward VI. On 4 November 1547 the English parliament had decided to allow the two elements used in the communion to be enjoyed by all people. Guido probably kept company with a number of refugees from continental Europe: Tremellius, Val√©rand Poullain, Martin Bucer, John a Lasco, Jan Utenhove, Marten de Klyne (Marten Micron or Micronius), Wouter Deelen, Fran√ßois Perucel de la Rivi√®re and others. Whilst in England Guido attended the church of John a Lasco, and in 1551 he also became familiar with a Lasco's London Confession. The largest group of refugees came from the Low Countries. John a Lasco served as superintendent to a number of foreign congregations including the Dutch. A Lasco was a Polish nobleman with Zwinglian tendencies.(1551). Guido left England in 1552 before Mary, Queen of England came to the throne. De Bres went to Germany and later moved back to Geneva. Around 1559 he returned to the Low Countries, but now as a travelling Calvinist preacher. From 1559 to 1561 he served as the resident minister in Tournai. In 1561 De Bres authored the Belgic Confession. This confession was meant for the Spanish Government to show them that the Calvinists weren't a radical Anabaptist sectarian movement, but demanded a Reformation in the biblical sense of the Roman Catholic Church. The text is strongly influenced by Calvin's \\"Institutes of the Christian Religion\\" and the creed of the French Huguenots. The creed was printed by Jean Crespin in Geneva. On the night of November 1, 1561, De Bres threw his creed over the castle wall of Tournai, where Margaret of Parma, governor of the Netherlands stayed, to bring the confession to the attention of the Spanish government....  Death  In 1567, after the Siege of Valenciennes De Bres was arrested for his Calvinist beliefs and his rebellion during the siege. He was tried before the Spanish Inquisition, received the death penalty and was hanged at Valenciennes. He died in front of a large crowd after making a final statement of his beliefs. He was pushed off the scaffold by the hangman whilst addressing the crowd. Twelve days before his death he wrote a letter. to his wife, which speaks of his trust in God.  Legacy  De Bres wrote a number of books. The Belgic Confession is part of the Three Forms of Unity, a set of official statements of doctrine used by churches with roots in the continental Reformed tradition. Its text is still in wide use in particular among confessionally Reformed churches.

It is designed, manufactured, and distributed by Kimber Manufacturing, Inc. in Yonkers, New York.  Overview  The Custom is made in a variety of styles with different features and finishes. As an M1911 style pistol, it is usually chambered in .45 ACP. It also has been produced in other calibers, including .40 S&W;, 10mm Auto, 9mm Luger, and .38 Super. The individual gun's caliber is stamped on top of the barrel and is visible with the slide in battery (fully forward). The Custom is a full-sized model 1911, with a five-inch barrel. The frame and slide are made of steel. The Custom utilizes a single full-length guide rod, necessitating the serrations on the front of the slide for press checks. Although the Custom is considered Kimber's base model, it has a number of features that were formerly found only on customized model 1911s, such as a lowered ejection port, custom trigger, beveled magazine well, extended thumb safety, and beavertail grip safety.Johnston, Gary Paul. Shooting Times review of the Kimber Custom LAPD SWAT model The original Custom model has been superseded by the Custom II. The Custom II has an internal firing pin safety. This feature is designed to provide additional assurance that the gun will not fire if dropped, as the firing pin is blocked from striking the chambered cartridge unless the grip safety is depressed.  Custom TLE II  The Kimber Custom TLE II is a model of Kimber Custom. The designation \\"TLE\\" stands for \\"Tactical Law Enforcement\\". The TLE is identical, except for the markings, to a special model that was designed for use by the LAPD SWAT team. Unlike the standard Custom, it comes with tritium bar-dot night sights and 30 lines per inch frontstrap checkering.Arnold, David W. Handguns review of the Kimber Custom LAPD SWAT model The TLE has been manufactured in the following variations: *Custom TLE II, the standard variation and the same as the LAPD SWAT model. *Custom TLE II (LG), with laser grip sights. *Custom TLE/RL II, with an accessory mounting rail. *Stainless TLE II, with a stainless steel finish. *Stainless TLE/RL II, with a stainless steel finish and an accessory mounting rail.  ICQB, Warrior, and Desert Warrior  The Kimber Warrior and Desert Warrior are models that are based on a special version of the Custom that was built for the United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command.Johnston, Gary Paul. \\"One Good Pistol: The Kimber MCSOCOM ICQB\\", Military.com The MARSOC pistol, known as the Kimber ICQB (Interim Close Quarter Battle) pistol, does not have an internal firing pin block as seen on the rest of the current Kimber Custom models, hence a \\"II\\" does not follow the Warrior or Desert Warrior's names. These pistols have an ambidextrous thumb safety, a lanyard loop, an internal extractor, and, in contrast to other Custom models, a standard length recoil spring guide rod to allow easier field stripping without tools.Johnston, Gary Paul. \\"Kimber's Warriors\\", Soldier of Fortune, September 5, 2006 The ICQB pistol is fitted with a screw-on Dawson Precision light rail, Novak LoMount tritium night sights, and brown Simonich Gunner grips. The guns were delivered to MARSOC equipped with SureFire integrated military pistol lights, Gemtech TRL tactical retention lanyards, and Wilson Combat 7- or 8-round magazines. The Warrior and Desert Warrior have a frame-integrated M1913 light rail, Kimber Meprolight tritium night sights, and Kimber's own special grips that are very similar to the Gunner grips in coyote brown. They are delivered with Kimber factory magazines. They are otherwise the same as the ICQB pistols. The Warrior has a matte black KimPro finish and a standard Custom trigger. The Desert Warrior comes in a green-tan KimPro finish that would blend in with desert camouflage, and has a solid trigger.Johnston, Gary Paul. \\"Kimber's Custom Covert\\", Soldier of Fortune, December 3, 2007  Other Custom models  Other models of Kimber Custom include the following: *Stainless II, with a frame and slide made of stainless steel, and therefore silver in color instead of matte black. *Custom Target II, with adjustable target sights. *Stainless Target II, with adjustable target sights and a stainless steel frame and slide.Wilson, Jim. \\"Kimber Stainless Target II .38 Super\\", Shooting Times *Royal II, with a polished blue finish and rosewood grips.  Related models  Kimber has also produced several higher-end full-sized model 1911 pistols that are closely based on the Custom, but are not considered part of the Custom line due to their additional features and higher price. These include the following: *Eclipse Custom II, with bi-tone stainless and black finish and night sights. *Tactical Custom II, with gray aluminum frame, black steel slide, night sights, ambidextrous thumb safety, and extended magazine well. *Custom CDP II, with black aluminum frame, stainless steel slide, night sights, ambidextrous thumb safety, and \\"carry melt\\" rounded edges. *Custom Covert II, with desert camouflage aluminum frame, black steel slide, laser light grips, standard length guide rod, night sights, lanyard loop, and \\"carry melt\\" rounded edges. *SIS Custom, with gray finish, flat top slide, standard length guide rod, night sights with cocking shoulder, ambidextrous thumb safety, and \\"carry melt\\" rounded edges, and without a firing pin safety. *Custom Crimson Carry II, with aluminum frame, matte black steel slide, and rosewood finish laser grips. *Super Carry Custom, with aluminum frame, matte black steel slide, night sights with cocking shoulder, round heel frame, \\"carry melt\\" rounded edges, and without a firing pin safety.

He later served as colonial official in Martinique and French Guiana, as well as an administrator in France and Antwerp.  Biography  Laussat was born in the town of Pau. After serving as receveur g√©n√©ral des finances in Pau and Bayonne, he was imprisoned during the Terror, but was released and recruited in the arm√©e des Pyr√©n√©es. On April 17, 1797, he was elected to the Council of Ancients. After the coup of 18 Brumaire, he entered the Tribunat on December 25, 1798. He was appointed by Napoleon Bonaparte to be colonial prefect (governor) of Louisiana in 1802 and arrived in the colony on March 26, 1803, just two weeks before Bonaparte made his decision to sell Louisiana to the United States. Laussat was initially only to be the interim head of Louisiana until arrival of the Governor General Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte appointed by Bonaparte. However, when Bonaparte rejected Bernadotte's request for additional settlers and support for the posting, Bernadotte declined the governorship. This left Laussat ruling as governor for several months, during which time he abolished the local cabildo and then published the Napoleonic Code in the colony. Within several months, Laussat heard that Louisiana had been sold to the U.S. but he did not believe it. On July 28, 1803, he wrote to the French government to inquire whether the rumor was true. On August 18, 1803, he received word from Bonaparte that France had declared war on Great Britain and that he was to transfer Louisiana to the United States. On November 30, 1803, Laussat served as commissioner of the French government in the retrocession of Louisiana from Spain to France. A few weeks later, on December 20, 1803, Laussat transferred the colony to the U.S. representatives, William C.C. Claiborne and James Wilkinson. On April 21, 1804, Laussat left Louisiana to become colonial prefect of Martinique, serving until 1809 when he was captured and imprisoned by the British. In 1810, Laussat returned to France and sought a new governmental posting. He was sent to the French Netherlands to oversee the port of occupied Antwerp (1810‚Äì1812) and then to serve as prefect of Jemmape (1812‚Äì1814). During the Hundred Days, he served as prefect of Pas-de-Calais until the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo. During the Bourbon Restoration, he served as commandant of French Guiana from 1819 to 1823, after which he retired to his ancestral chateau in France where he died in 1835.

The relationship typically relies on either side never fully defeating the other, because the whole time their 'conflict' helps both sides (while each side also simultaneously takes occasional 'acceptable' losses). Promoting adversaries requires neither side to be finally defeated throughout the relationship, because both sides actually prefer the relationship to continue and thus both sides to keep existing and fighting each other. In military, politics, and economics Promoting adversaries works within a tendency where those opposed are increasingly polarized. When the tactic is used, it has the effect of making those involved in the relationship even more extreme than they were to begin with. Fundamentalist groups become more fanatical ... and nations, agencies, militaries & political parties become more repressive and authoritarian -- as the promoting adversaries drags on. It is argued by some that the modern day guerrilla tactic of suicide bombing emerged from conditions in which one or more promoting adversaries relationships developed. In George Orwell's book Nineteen Eighty-Four, with typical or worse than typical command-economy style technological and industrial incompetence, the three remaining superpowers left in the world use high-intensity conventional total war against each other indefinitely. What reason, if any, they have for doing so is not quite clear. It could simply be for conquest and realpolitik in international relations. At first it appears to be for some sort of propaganda purpose, using the desperation and nationalism of the war to preserve some trace of persuasiveness of the propaganda in favor of their policies. However, that is not necessarily their actual strategy, because they have deliberately made their propaganda even more utterly unconvincing than it already is, and making sure that the population is constantly exposed to thorough and proficient, though still entirely obvious historical revision, and are exposed to introductions to Goldberg's political views for the sake of testing the population, making sure to provoke any potential dissidents into dissenting so that potential dissidents can be caught. The superpowers consider using nuclear weapons against each other's cities, not for retaliation, but for conquest, but decide to wait until they are \\"ready\\", which likely means that they do not yet consider it acceptable to finally destroy each other, perhaps because they are promoting adversaries. In pop culture and public relations This tactic is dynamically similar to certain publicity techniques, and so can be used by individuals and products seeking to gain/concentrate power or wealth as well. Some examples include: * Donald Trump vs. Rosie O'Donnell * Paris Hilton vs. Nicole Richie * Paris Hilton vs. Lindsay Lohan * Keith Olbermann of MSNBC vs. Bill O'Reilly of Fox News * Democratic Party vs. Republican Party in the United States As well as aspects of manufactured conflict for ratings purposes on many \\"reality\\" shows on TV... \\"Promoting Adversaries\\" has also been parodied most recently by Stephen Colbert on his show, The Colbert Report, in which Stephen's brand of Ben & Jerry's ice cream (AmeriCone Dream) is pitted against Willie Nelson's brand of Ben & Jerry's ice cream (Country Peach Cobbler). Of course, this public 'conflict' generates advertising for both products, which are owned by the same company. Promoting adversaries is a similar concept to the term frenemy.

Its main competing ideologies have been Berberism, Sahrawi nationalism, Moroccan irredentism, Tuareg nationalism and Pan-Arabism. Background The proposed Greater Mauritania shown within Africa The term was first used by Mauritania's first president, Mokhtar Ould Daddah, as he began claiming the territory then known as Spanish Sahara even before Mauritanian independence in 1960. In 1957, Ould Daddah stated :\\"I therefore call on our brothers in the Spanish Sahara to dream of this economic and spiritual Greater Mauritania of which we cannot speak at present. I address to them and I ask you to repeat to them a message of friendship, a call for concord between all the Moors of the Atlantic, in Azawad and from the Draa to the borders of Senegal.\\"Zekeria Ould Ahmed Salem, \\"Mauritania: A Saharan Frontier State\\", Journal of North Africa Studies, Vol. 10, No. 3-4, Sep-Dec. 2005, p. 506, n. 17. The basis for his claim was the close ethnic and cultural ties between the Mauritanian Moors and the Sahrawis of Spanish Sahara, in effect forming two subsets of the same tribal Arab-Berber population.Rachel Warner. \\"CHAPTER 1.

The claim to the Spanish Sahara was again popularized by the regime in the early 1970s, as Spain prepared to depart the colony.

() Say Thompson and Adloff, :\\"From the outset of his political career, Daddah voiced an irredentist policy with regard to the Western Sahara, with striking perseverance but also without flamboyance, with less than wholehearted backing by his people, and with smaller means at his disposal than those of Morocco. Realism having always characterised Daddah's appraisal of Mauritania's status, he progressively reduced his territorial demands from those of an area larger than the entire Spanish Sahara to what he called Western Tiris, or Tiris El Gharbia.\\"Virginia Thompson and Richard Adloff. The Western Saharans. Background to Conflict. Barnes & Noble Books, 1980. p. 270. () Mauritanian claims to the territory were thus used to stave off the perceived threat of Moroccan expansionism, and to entice Spain into dividing the territory between Morocco and Mauritania in the Madrid Accords. This, however, did not take into account an Advisory Opinion by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that had decided in late 1975 that the people of Western Sahara had a right to self-determination, to be exercised freely in the form of a choice between integration with one or both of Mauritania and Morocco, or setting up an independent state.Western Sahara: Summary of the Summary of the Advisory Opinion of 16 October 1975.

The line was built between 1828 and 1833 by Camille Seguin and Marc Seguin at a cost of 14,500,000 FRF.Structurae History=Construction Construction began in September 1826. Marc Seguin was chief engineer, chief of estates, maintenance and rolling stock at the same time. Despite all the natural obstacles he encountered, Seguin drew up the plans for line, 56 km in length, with a slow descent towards Lyon. The first part of the line, between Saint- √âtienne and Rive-de-Gier was laid at a constant descent of 1.2 to 1.4%. The following section, running along the Gier valley down to Givors, on the Rh√¥ne, was less inclined, with a slope of 0.65%. The last section of the line, to Lyon, was built virtually level. Technical data To avoid difficulties in acquiring land, with no laws concerning compulsory purchase at the time, Seguin built several bridges and tunnels. Between 1827 and 1830 he dug the first tunnel de Couzon √† Rive de Gier, with a length of 977 m, a second tunnel, only 400 m long, was dug in 1831 in Lyon. A third tunnel, 1.5 km in length, was dug under Terrenoire. Instead of cast iron laid on stone sleepers as was then the practice in mines, Seguin decided to use iron rails on wooden sleepers. Route The railway followed the path of the Janon from Terrenoire (now part of Saint-√âtienne) to Saint-Chamond, and then the Gier to the Rhone. Between Rive-de-Gier and Givors on the Rhone, the railway paralleled the Givors canal. The population was hostile to the railway which threatened many trades. Trains were derailed and wagons set on fire. In 1835 the proletarian poet Guillaume Roquille published his Franco-Proven√ßal language collection Ballon d'essai d'un jeune po√®te for√©zien (Trial balloon of a young For√©zien poet) violently attacked the arrival of the railway, which would ruin the canal on which his father worked as a porter. The line was at first meant to traverse Givors and cross the Rh√¥ne to finish its course on the left bank. However the inhabitants of Givors protested in such large numbers that it was decided to build the line on the right bank. The work lasted five years between 1827 and 1832. The first portion to be opened was between Givors and Rive-de-Gier which opened on 28 June 1830. A transfer between ships and trains was enabled by the construction of a water station at Givors. It became the largest harbour on the Rh√¥ne and an active industrial city. Traction St. √âtienne and Lyon Railway in the 1830s: \\\\- horse-drawn passenger train, \\\\- horse-drawn train with agricultural goods, ‚Äì passenger train, running downhill without traction, \\\\- coal transporting train drawn by a locomotive, looking older than 1835 types During the first few months of operation, horses were used to provide the tractive power. Where the line descended the horses were carried in a truck for the 22 km descent and then hauled the train for the remainder of journey. For the journey up, one horse was used to haul 5 or six empty wagons. The trains were pulled at 3 or 4 km/h but ran down hill at a speed of 24 to 28 km/h. For comfort, the Seguin company had placed drapes on the seats and used leather straps to open and close the windows. The first were cut out by passengers and made into clothes and the straps were used as belts! Opening sections From early 1831, the locomotive Seguin hauled twenty-four to twenty-eight empty wagons between Givors and Rive-de-Gier or seven full wagons. On 3 April 1832, the section up to Lyon was used for freight transport with a few passengers being accepted, who sat on straw in the wagons. The last section, to Saint-√âtienne, was opened on 1 October 1832 for passenger use only, freight being accepted a few months later. On 4 April 1833 the line was opened in its entirety. Rolling stock In 1836, the company possessed 12 locomotives, 135 wagons and transported its passengers from end to end in six hours. Accidents were a regular occurrence as people would sometimes walk along the railway line. From 1844, the use of horse traction was terminated and the entire journey was done in only 2 and a half hours. Lyon-Perrache.

Retrieved 14 September 2009 Early life Lindsay was born in Goolwa, South Australia, a son of Captain John Scott Lindsay (ca.1819 ‚Äì 29 June 1878), master mariner formerly of Dundee, Scotland, and his wife Catherine, n√©e Reid (ca.1822 ‚Äì 28 May 1884). John Lindsay commanded the brig Europa and Sir James Fergusson's yacht Edith before a career on Murray River steamers which included a pioneering trip to Brewarrina with W. R. Randell in 1859. Young Lindsay was educated in Goolwa and under Rev. John Hotham at Port Elliot. At age 15 Lindsay went to work in a chemist shop and then with an Adelaide mining agent. Explorer Lindsay became an apprentice in the state government survey department in 1873. In 1878 he was appointed (\\"gazetted\\" in Public Service parlance) as a senior surveyor in March 1875. In 1878 he was appointed junior surveyor and clerk in the land office of the Department of the Northern Territory at Palmerston (now Darwin) in the Northern Territory. In 1882 he resigned from the government service to take up private practice, but about a year later was placed in charge of a South Australian government expedition to Arnhem Land (in the Northern Territory). The party, consisting of four white men and two Indigenous Australians, met with a hostile response from local Aboriginal people, and drove them off with firearms. Some of the horses had been stampeded during the conflict and the explorers only reached civilisation after suffering many privations. Lindsay subsequently explored territory between the Overland Telegraph Line and the Queensland border and discovered Australia's first payable mica field. In 1886 Lindsay was exploring in the region of the MacDonnell Ranges and discovered so-called rubies.* The 1885‚Äì86 expedition traced the Finke River to its mouth. Early in 1891 Lindsay was placed in charge of the Elder Scientific Exploring Expedition entirely equipped by Sir Thomas Elder, and which included Dr. Elliott, a Queensland medical man with photographic and botanical expertise; Helms of the Sydney Museum and Streich, a German geologist and mineralogist. Starting from Warrina, South Australia, with 42 camels on 2 May 1891 with the intention of covering as much unexplored territory as possible between there and the western coast of Australia, the expedition was unfortunate in striking an extremely dry season, the results were disappointing, and the expedition was abandoned without completing much that had been intended. However, in the 11 months to 4 April 1892 over 4000 miles (6,400 km) were traversed, and about 80,000 square miles (206,000 km¬≤). were mapped. Charges were made by the second officer and three other members of the party concerning Lindsay's management of the expedition, but after an inquiry had been held he was exonerated. The abandonment of the expedition was 'a terrible disappointment' to Lindsay. In 1893, Lindsay overlanded camels to Coolgardie after news of gold discoveries there, and sold them at a profit. Lindsay made a number of observations on indigenous tribes' cultures and languages during all his explorations and survey expeditions, in particular The Elder Scientific Exploration Expedition of 1891 and the Explorations in the Northern Territory of South Australia (including the Arnheim (sic) Land exploration). The scope of the Elder Scientific Expedition, funded by Sir Thomas Elder, included recording fauna, flora, geological structures and climate, mapping the territory, potential for pastoral development, recording original indigenous place names, languages and pronunciation, avoiding conflict with indigenous tribes and to investigate the disappearance of Ludwig Leichhardt. The expedition occurred during a period of extensive drought. Aided by indigenous people, water was not only sourced but evidence of water harvesting and management of evaporation through shoring up water sources with rocks and branches was observed. Indigenous people were somewhat alarmed at how much camels drank ‚Äì 44 camels needed 800 gallons of water every few days. Lindsay also noted the extent of burning of the land and the constant presence of smoke observed on the horizon. The mallee scrub had been 'burnt in vast patches' possible a year or two previously' and burnt ground had better feed for the camels than unburnt land. Lindsay‚Äôs Brief Notes on the Aborigines met with by the Elder Expedition of 1891-2, describes differences in physique among different tribes, the reluctance of women and children to interact with the white men although indigenous men interacted variously in friendly or hostile ways. Harvesting water was observed by indigenous tribes excavating conglomerate rocks and after rainfall enlarging the hole until a well was formed with capacity of 300‚Äì500 gallons of water. Lindsay also observed indigenous living conditions in particular on the Northern Territory expedition. Lindsay records a 'solitary mia-mia (temporary shelter) formed of bamboo thickly thatched with grass , 6 ft high 10 ft in diameter ..with one entrance‚Ä¶so small I had the greatest difficulty in squeezing through it‚Ä¶the natives told me that when occupied , the entrance was stopped up with grass to keep out mosquitoes. It was used at the beginning of the wet season (to gather) wild fowls eggs and a stopping place from one route to another during the wet season' Lindsay also observes 'manufacture of rope and string out of fibre plants. Baskets are woven so closely as to be water tight' . Communication was also swift with one communication of the 'murder of a white man‚Ä¶conveyed over 200 miles in less than twenty-four hours'. Lindsay believed that the Northern Territory could support extensive pastoral ground and in Arnheim (sic) Land gold, silver, copper and tin had already been discovered. In Mr Lindsay‚Äôs Explorations through Arnheim‚Äôs Land 1884, Lindsay notes the use of fishing: 'saw a native fishtrap made of ‚Äú supple jack\\" woven like a basket, 18 ft long and gradually tapering from 3 ft wide at its mouth, leaving at one side a hole to which the mouth of the reap is fixed. As the ride goes in or out the fish coming with it find a barrier, then with a rush, they go through what they suppose to be an opening, but which is in reality a trap, with a blackfellow at the other end ready to pop them into his basket as they come through the hole'. In general, however, the expedition in Arnhem Land was frought with hostility between indigenous people and white people. It appears that Lindsay was reluctant at first to engage in hostilities which he encountered especially around Castlereagh Bay, the Roper River and in the locality of the Wornunyan Woorie. 'Were I to go there again I would shoot the first blackfellow I saw'. Later life Lindsay circa 1897 In 1895 Lindsay was in business as a stockbroker, formed various companies connected with Western Australian goldmines, and shortly before World War I broke out in 1914 was in London raising capital for development work in the Northern Territory. This and other projects had to be abandoned on account of the war. After the war, Lindsay was in the Northern Territory for three and a half years carrying out topographical surveys for the Australian Federal government. Some good pastoral land was discovered, and Lindsay proved that the Queensland artesian water system extended some 150 miles further west than its supposed limits. He was working in the north again in 1922 but was attacked by illness and died in the Darwin hospital of valvular disease of the heart on 17 December 1922. Lindsay married Annie Theresa Stuart Lindsay on 10 March 1881. She was a daughter of (unrelated) Arthur Lindsay, longtime Superintendent of Adelaide Destitute Asylum. She survived him with four sons and a daughter. Lindsay was tall and broad-shouldered of a genial disposition, a typical and capable bushman.

Oaklands is on the National Register of Historic Places and is a local landmark known for its unique Italianate design. The plantation was caught in the middle of the Civil War and officers from both the Confederate and Union armies stayed in the mansion. The most notable visitor to the home was Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who stayed at Oaklands December 12-15 1862 accompanied by his aid George Washington Custis Lee, son of Confederate General Robert Edward Lee. Other notable visitors were former United States First Lady Sarah Childress Polk, United States Senator from Tennessee and the 1860 Constitutional Union Party's nominee for President of the United States John Bell, Confederate General Braxton Bragg, Confederate Lieutenant-Genera Leonidas Polk, Confederate Naval CommanderMatthew Fontaine Maury and Confederate Brigadier-General George Maney. During the First Battle of Murfreesboro on July 13, 1862, Confederate cavalrymen under Nathan Bedford Forrest surprised and defeated Federal forces encamped on the plantation grounds on the front lawn of the Mansion, ear near the plantation's spring and at the Rutherford County Courthouse as part of a raid on Union-occupied Murfreesboro. It is said that Lewis and Adaline Maney's children watched the fighting from the window of the second floor hallway. After the surrender was signed, both armies gathered for a meal of black eyed peas and sweet potatoes. Colonel William Ward Duffield of the 9th Michigan Infantry, was severely wounded and captured by the Confederates during the early part of the battle. He was taken into the house and nursed by the Maney family. At noon the same day he was made prisoner by General Forrest, but, in his then helpless condition, he was released upon his parole and promised not to bear arms against the Confederate States until regularly exchanged. Mrs. Duffield was a guest in the Maney home while her husband recovered for several months. The Duffields and the Maneys became friends during the Colonel's recuperation. After the war the Duffields presented the Maneys with a silver tea service in gratitude for their hospitality and care of the Colonel. The last residential owner of Oaklands, Rebecca Jetton, moved out of the house in the 1950s when she was no longer able to maintain it. The abandoned mansion was vandalized and left in disrepair. The city of Murfreesboro acquired it in 1958 with the intention of tearing it down. However, the mansion was restored to its original grandeur by a group of women who rallied together to form the Oaklands Association. The home was opened to the public as a museum in the early 1960s and now receives thousands of visitors annually and is used for various public and private functions.

Regions of Indiana The geography of Indiana comprises the physical features of the land and relative location of U.S. State of Indiana. Indiana is in the north-central United States and borders on Lake Michigan. Surrounding states are Michigan to the north and northeast, Illinois to the west, Kentucky to the south, and Ohio to the east. The entire southern boundary is the Ohio River. Statistics * Total area is , making Indiana the 38th largest in size out of the 50 states. * Lake Michigan is the largest body of water wholly or partially within the state borders. * Near Bethel in Wayne County is the highest point in the state at above sea level. * The Ohio River at southwest of Mt. Vernon is the lowest point, at above sea level. Overview Indiana is bordered on the north by Lake Michigan and the state of Michigan; on the east by Ohio; on the south by Kentucky, with which it shares the Ohio River as a border; and on the west by Illinois. Indiana is one of the Great Lakes states. The northern boundary of the states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois was originally defined to be a latitudinal line drawn through the southernmost tip of Lake Michigan. Since such a line did not provide Indiana with usable frontage on the lake, its northern border was shifted ten miles (16 km) north when it was granted statehood in 1816. The 475 mile (764 km) long Wabash River bisects the state from northeast to southwest before flowing south, mostly along the Indiana- Illinois border. The river has given Indiana a few theme songs, such as On the Banks of the Wabash, The Wabash Cannonball and Back Home Again, In Indiana. The Wabash is the longest free-flowing river east of the Mississippi River, traversing from the Huntington dam to the Ohio River. The White River, a tributary of the Wabash, zigzags through central Indiana. There are 24 Indiana state parks, nine man-made reservoirs, and hundreds of lakes in the state. Areas under the control and protection of the National Park Service or the United States Forest Service include: *George Rogers Clark National Historical Park in Vincennes *Indiana Dunes National Park near Michigan City *Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial in Lincoln City *Hoosier National Forest in Bedford Regions The state of Indiana can be divided into several distinct regions. Northern Indiana Highlighted are the counties in Northern Indiana. Northern Indiana consists of 26 counties in the northern third of the state. The landscape is characterized physically by very flat to rolling terrain ranging from above sea level and is similar to central Indiana except for the presence of higher and hillier terminal moraines and many glacial kettle lakes in some areas. Sand dunes and sand ridges also exist along the Lake Michigan shoreline(some reaching near 200 feet in height) and inland around the Kankakee River Basin. The Saint Lawrence River Divide goes through Northern Indiana following the top of the Valparaiso Moraine part of the way. Besides some urban areas, much of Northern Indiana is farmland. Heavy industry is as much a part of the economy in the eastern two thirds of Northern Indiana as agriculture, and, as a result, the region tends to be associated with the Rust Belt. Northern Indiana as a whole is also the most ethnically diverse region in Indiana. The northwest corner of the state is part of the Chicago metropolitan area and has nearly one million residents. Gary, and the cities and towns that make up the northern half of Lake, Porter, and La Porte Counties bordering on Lake Michigan, are effectively commuter suburbs of Chicago. Porter and Lake counties are commonly referred to as \\"The Calumet Region\\". The name comes from the fact that the Grand Calumet River and Little Calumet rivers run through the area. These counties are in the Central Time Zone, the same as Chicago. NICTD owns and operates the South Shore Line, a commuter rail line that runs electric-powered trains between South Bend and Chicago. Sand dunes and heavy industry share the shoreline of Lake Michigan in northern Indiana. Along the shoreline of Lake Michigan in Northern Indiana one can find many parks between the industrial areas. The Indiana Dunes National Park and the Indiana Dunes State Park are two natural landmarks of the area. Northwest Indiana is marked with swell and swale topography as it retreats South from Lake Michigan (which are remnants of the beaches of ancient Lake Michigan) and is one of the marshiest parts of the state. The ecology changes dramatically between swells, or on opposite sides of the same swell. Plants and animals adapted to marshes are generally found in the swales, while forests or even prickly pear cactus and six-lined racerunners are found in the dryer swells.Jackson, 211 North Manchester. Much of Northern Indiana is considered part of Amish Country and holds the nation's second largest population of such people. The Kankakee River, which winds through northern Indiana, serves somewhat as a demarcating line between suburban northwest Indiana and the rest of the state. Before it was drained and developed for agriculture, the Kankakee Marsh was one of the largest freshwater marshes in the country.Jackson, 190 South of the Kankakee is a large area of prairie, the eastern edge of the Grand Prairie that covers Iowa and Illinois.Jackson, p. 189 The prairie chicken and American bison were common in Indiana's pioneer era, but are now extinct as wild species within the state. The South Bend metropolitan area, in north central Indiana, is the center of commerce in the region better known as Michiana. Other cities located within the area include Elkhart, Mishawaka, Goshen, and Warsaw. Fort Wayne, the state's second largest city, is located in the northeastern part of the state where it serves the state as a transportation hub. Other cities located within the area include Huntington and Marion. East of Fort Wayne is an area of extremely flat land that, before development, was the western-most reach of the Great Black Swamp.Jackson, p. 201 Northeastern Indiana is home to a number of lakes, many of which are kettle lakes, which were caused by the glaciers that covered Indiana thousands of years ago and Glacial Lake Maumee. Some of these lakes include Lake James in Pokagon State Park, Lake Maxinkuckee, Lake Wawasee and Lake Tippecanoe. Lake Wawasee is the largest natural lake in Indiana, while Lake Tippecanoe is the deepest lake, reaching depths of over . Both lakes are located in Kosciusko County. Chain O' Lakes State Park, located in Noble County, contains 11 lakes, 8 of which are connected by natural channels. =Michiana= The center third of this region is known as the Indiana section of Michiana. South Bend is the cultural and economic center of the Michiana region. =Maumee Valley= The eastern third of this region centers around the Fort Wayne area and the Maumee River basin. Central Indiana Highlighted are the counties in Central Indiana. Central Indiana comprises the 33 counties in the middle third of the state. However, many Hoosiers, or people living in Indiana, consider central Indiana as the Indianapolis metropolitan area. The region's dominant city by far is Indianapolis. Other prominent cities include Lafayette, Kokomo, Anderson, Muncie, and Terre Haute. Central Indiana is the most populous region of Indiana. The primary economic engines of Central Indiana are education and research, agriculture and manufacturing, and as a result, some of the larger cities in the region are dealing with Rust Belt issues similar to Northern Indiana. Major universities include Butler University, Purdue University, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis, Ball State University, Indiana Wesleyan University, and Indiana State University. Physically, the land in Central Indiana is characterized primarily by low, gently rolling hills and shallow valleys. Some counties of the region, like Howard County, are more flat in nature, while others, such as Morgan County are more rugged and hilly, while Tippecanoe County, trisected by the Wabash River, Tippecanoe River, and Wildcat Creek, has perhaps the most diverse physiography of the region. Elevation ranges from (and more) above sea level. Forests and farmland line Central Indiana's gently rolling plains and river valleys. The highest point in Indiana is Hoosier Hill, at above sea level in northern Wayne County. The state capital and largest city, Indianapolis, is situated in the central portion of the state. It is intersected by numerous Interstates, U.S. highways, and railways giving the state its motto as \\"The Crossroads of America\\". Other cities located within the area include Anderson, Carmel, Kokomo, Lafayette, Richmond, and Terre Haute. Rural areas in the central portion of the state are typically composed of a patchwork of fields and forested areas. The geography of Central Indiana consists of gently rolling hills and sandstone ravines carved out by the retreating glaciers. Many of these ravines can be found in west-central Indiana, specifically along Sugar Creek in Turkey Run State Park and Shades State Park. Southern Indiana Highlighted are the counties of Southern Indiana.Evansville, the third largest city in Indiana, is located in the southwestern corner of the state. It is located in a tri-state area that includes Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky. The south-central cities of Clarksville, Jeffersonville, and New Albany are part of the Louisville metropolitan area. Bloomington, the home of Indiana University's main campus, and Columbus, a small industrial city, are located in the northern part of this region. Vincennes, founded by French traders in 1732 and the oldest settlement in the state, is located on the Wabash River as served as the first capital of the Indiana Territory. Vincennes is also home of the Pantheon Theatre. Indiana was settled from its southern periphery northward; many more of its oldest settlements, including its first capital, Corydon, are in southern Indiana. Until 1950, the United States Census found the center of population to lie in southern Indiana. Southern Indiana is a mixture of farmland, forest and very hilly areas, especially near Louisville and in the south central lime hills areas, stretching from the Ohio River to as far north as Greencastle, to the wide, flat valleys along the Wabash and Ohio rivers. The Hoosier National Forest is a nature preserve in south central Indiana. Southern Indiana's topography is more varied than that in the north and generally contains more hills and geographic variation than the northern portion, such as the \\"Knobs,\\" a series of hills that run parallel to the Ohio River in south-central Indiana. The largely flat and flood-prone bottomlands of Indiana, where the Wabash, White, and Ohio Rivers converge, hosts numerous plant and animal species normally found in the Lower Mississippi and Gulf Coast region of the United States.Jackson, 177 Brown County is well known for its hills covered with colorful autumn foliage, the former home of T. C. Steele, and Nashville, the county seat and shopping destination. Harrison and Crawford Counties boast three of the state's most popular commercial caves at Wyandotte, Marengo, and Squire Boone Caverns. The limestone geology of Southern Indiana has created numerous caves and one of the largest limestone quarry regions in the United States. Many of Indiana's official buildings, such as the Indiana Statehouse, the downtown monuments, the Indiana University School of Law in Indianapolis, many buildings at Indiana University Bloomington, and the Indiana Government Center, are all examples of Indiana architecture made with Indiana limestone. Indiana limestone has also been used in many other famous structures in the United States, such as the Empire State Building, the Pentagon, and the Washington National Cathedral. In addition, 35 of the 50 state capitols are made of Indiana limestone. Physiography Indiana is broken up into three main physical regions: The Great Lakes Plain in the northern third of the state, the Tipton Till Plain in the central third, and the Southern Hills and Lowlands region in the southern third. Geology Two-thirds of Indiana is covered with glacial till, from a few feet to hundreds of feet thick. The visible geology of the State is therefore mainly Quaternary, with rocks buried deeply. The southern third of the state is unglaciated and the bedrock becomes visible. The Cincinnati Arch and the Kankakee Arch are the predominate geologic features which control the underlying bedrock.Kankakee Arch in Illinois; George E. Ekblaw; Circular No. 40.; State of Illinois; State Geological Survey, Urbana, Illinois; 1938 The oldest bedrock is Ordovician, forming an arch across the state from the southeastern corner near Cincinnati north and westward to the northwestern corner near Chicago. These layers of shale and limestone are exposed at the surface only in the southern reaches. Parallel to this line on north and south edges is a narrow band of Silurian age bedrock. These are primarily limestone and dolomite. The next band of rocks are Devonian in age and pass under Lafayette, Indianapolis and New Albany, across the Ohio River from Louisville. Greater erosion and thinner layers of glacial till have created surface exposures along river vallies. The last band of bedrock is from the Carboniferous age and covers nearly a third of the states southwestern area. There the states ‚Äòcoal measures‚Äô are exposed and major surface mining activities have built the local economies. A narrow belt of Mississippian age limestone, shale, and sandstone occurs west and southwards of Bloomington and had become known for its production of Indiana Limestone an important building material.http://igs.indiana.edu/images/bedrock Coal Indiana's ‚ÄòCoal Measures‚Äô are in the southwest corner of the state, where the bedrock is of the Pennsylvanian era.1922 Handbook of Indiana geology; W.N. Logan, S.S. Vishner, E.R. Cumings, W.M. Tucker; C.A. Malott, & J.R. Reeves; Department of Conservation, State of Indiana; Indianapolis, Indiana: 1922 Rivers The Wabash River is the longest river in Indiana and cuts across the state from east to west. The Wabash and its main tributaries, the Salamonie River, Mississinewa River, Eel River, Tippecanoe River, White River, Vermilion River, and Embarras River drain Central Indiana. The Iroquois and Kankakee Rivers begin in Indiana and flow westward into Illinois before reaching the Mississippi River. The St. Joseph River flows from the state of Michigan through the northern counties at South Bend before returning to Michigan and ending at Lake Michigan. The Maumee River in the northeast is formed by the St. Mary's River and the St. Joseph River, which join in Fort Wayne before flowing into the state of Ohio to end at Lake Erie. The Ohio River forms the southern boundary of the State, draining the lower two tiers of counties.

Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill fishing at Shangri-La,See Camp David in between the May 1943 Trident Conference discussions. Winston Churchill and his chiefs of staff en route to the USA The third Washington Conference (codenamed Trident) was held in Washington, D.C from May 12 to May 25, 1943. It was a World War II strategic meeting between the heads of government of the United Kingdom and the United States. It was the third conference of the 20th century (1941, 1942, 1943), but the second conference that took place during the US involvement in the Second World War. The delegations were headed by Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, respectively.Herman, Arthur. Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II, p. 305, Random House, New York, NY, 2012. . The plans for the Allied invasion of Sicily, extent of military force, the date for invading Normandy, and the progress of the Pacific War were discussed.  Meetings  Churchill and Roosevelt met every two days in the White House, and the British and American military leaders met almost daily in the Board of Governors Room at the Federal Reserve Building.  Topics of discussion and agreements  Churchill opened the discussion with ideas, which were discussed in an open manner between the two countries. The main topics that were discussed were the Italian Campaign, the amount of military force that should be used, the Normandy landings, and how to help China in the Pacific War. Churchill felt that the extent of the operations and their priority could be solved by mutual agreement, and consensus was reached on all issues.  The Italian campaign  The first topic discussed was the war in Italy. Churchill persuaded the American leaders to endorse the Allied invasion of Sicily. He believed that the fighting in Italy would distract the German troops from the Eastern Front so that Russia would be given breathing room since the Germans would need to send a large number of troops to the Balkans. This would get rid of the Allies' debt to Russia from Russia's heavy engagement of German forces in Stalingrad. Getting Italy out of the war would also help the Allies' relationship with Turkey. Turkey could no longer compete with Italy in the Mediterranean. Churchill believed that they could ask Turkey for use of their bases for future defense.  Extent of military force  The next objective discussed was the extent of the military force that the Allies should use. Both countries agreed that they should use the greatest amount of military force against the enemy, including armies, air forces and munitions. Unconditional surrender, first mentioned at the Casablanca Conference, was debated again at Trident. Both Trident and Casablanca had competitive atmospheres due to the differing views on unconditional surrender. Roosevelt was persistent against American General Dwight D. Eisenhower and British General Henry Maitland Wilson's anti-unconditional views of surrender. Despite these opposing views, after much consideration, the Allies agreed that they wanted to carry the war to Japan. They believed that Germany would be out of the war in 1944, so they would need to concentrate on defeating Japan in 1945. The best solution would be involving Russia in the fight against Japan because Stalin had indicated his interest in taking part in Japan's defeat.  The Normandy landings  The Normandy landings were postponed for 12 months to May 1944. This was because the US and the UK speculated that they could build up troop strength, produce more landing craft and supplies, and thus ensure complete command of air and sea by doing so. They discussed the difficult beaches with large tides, the large German enemy defenses, the optimal timing to attack, and relevant weather conditions. The main reason why the Allies wanted to postpone the landings was because of their lack of supplies in 1943. All the British landing craft had been deployed to Operation Husky, and only one US Division was available due to a higher priority of Operation Sickle in the war.  Aid to China  Lastly, the US and the UK decided what to do in the Pacific War. British Field Marshal Wavell visited Burma and helped brace the Allies for the many obstacles they would face, including: * the thick jungle preventing the use of modern weapons * the monsoons that limited the amount of potential attack time * few options for naval support Other than air support, there were few alternatives to help China, so efficient planning was necessary. The countries agreed it would be better to by-pass a ground attack in Burma and instead use the element of surprise by air attack, as in Operation Torch. The fleet from Italy was to cover this operation in March 1944.  Other results  The Trident Conference shows a change in domination over world leadership, as the Americans were influential over other countries. American initiatives received twice the amount of Allied military resources, while Britain had to compromise on several of their requests. In particular, US Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall led this change to increase the role of the Americans in the war effort, which had been previously dominated by Britain. However, the actions after Sicily still remained unsettled. Churchill wanted an Italian Campaign to follow, but Roosevelt worried that the campaign might delay the strategic plans for recapturing France that had been planned for the following year. According to Max Hastings, Brooke's reputation as a strategist was \\"significantly damaged\\" by his remarks at the Trident Conference, where he claimed that no major operations on the continent would be possible until 1945 or 1946. Brooke's diary says that he wanted operations in the Mediterranean to force a dispersal of German forces, help Russia, and thus eventually produce a situation where cross Channel operations are possible but that Churchill entirely repudiated (or half repudiated) the paper we (the CCOS) had agreed on; Harry Hopkins got him to withdraw his proposed amendments but Churchill had aroused suspicions with his talk of ventures in the Balkans.

St. Vincent's was founded in 1849 and was a major teaching hospital in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. It closed on April 30, 2010, under circumstances that triggered an investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney. Demolition began at the end of 2012 and was completed in early 2013. Other hospital buildings are being converted into luxury condos and a new luxury building, Greenwich Lane, has replaced the St. Vincent's building. History=Operation For more than 150 years, St. Vincent's Hospital served a wide range of New Yorkers, especially in its neighborhood of Greenwich Village, including poets, writers, artists, homeless people, the poor and the working class. It treated victims of the cholera epidemic of 1849 and of the Hudson River landing of US Airways Flight 1549. It was the designated provider for New York and New Jersey members of the U.S. Department of Defense Health Plan. Over time it expanded to become a major medical and research center. It maintained its connection to the Roman Catholic tradition, and was sponsored by the Bishop of Brooklyn and the President of the Sisters of Charity of New York. =19th century= St. Vincent's was the third oldest hospital in New York City after The New York Hospital and Bellevue Hospital. It was founded as a medical facility in 1849 and named for St. Vincent de Paul, a seventeenth-century French priest, whose religious congregation of the Daughters of Charity inspired the founding in Maryland in 1809 of the Sisters of Charity by St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, a native New Yorker and Roman Catholic convert. St. Vincent de Paul is the patron saint of all charitable societies.\\"Saint Vincent de Paul\\", Franciscan Media Drawing on its Catholic heritage, SVCMC's emphasis was on patient-focused healthcare, with a special mission to provide care for the poor and disenfranchised. > \\"Respect: The basic dignity of the human person is the guiding principal in > all our interactions, policies and procedures. > Integrity: Integrity is the consistency between the Catholic identity we > profess and the ways in which we act it is that quality of truthfulness, > which fosters trust. > Compassion: Compassion is the way we share deep concern, love and care > toward each person. > Excellence: Excellence is our way of demonstrating that we can always be > more, always be better.\\" In 1817, four Sisters of Charity from Emmitsburg, Maryland arrived at the request of Bishop John Connolly to establish an orphanage. As the congregation grew, the sisters opened more orphanages and began to staff parochial schools. In 1846, the Sisters in New York incorporated as a separate entity from the Sisters of Charity based in Maryland. They then set up a charity hospital to meet the demands of the poor and disadvantaged. It began as a thirty-bed hospital in a small brick house on East 13th Street. St. Vincent's served the poor as one of the few charity hospitals in New York City. The hospital opened on November 1, 1849, during a cholera epidemic, under the direction of Sister M. Angela Hughes, sister of Bishop John Hughes. With almost every room occupied by patients, the sisters ate, slept, and rested in a single room, or had their beds at the ends of the halls. A typhoid epidemic in 1852, filled the hospital to capacity. After outgrowing those quarters in 1856, the sisters moved to a former orphanage at the then undeveloped corner of West 11th Street and Seventh Avenue. In 1859, a fair was held at the New York Crystal Palace to raise funds to renovate the former orphanage and erect two additional wings.\\"St. Vincent's Hospital, New York\\", The Catholic Church in the United States of America, Catholic Editing Company, 1914, p. 59 In 1870, the hospital introduced its first horse-drawn ambulance. In October 1892, it launched its School of Nursing. The Sisters admitted patients regardless of religion or ability to pay. The doctors from Bellevue also worked there. St. Vincent's also operated a soup kitchen. According to an 1892 New York Times article, St. Vincent's was distinguished from other hospitals in the city by its feeding of \\"a large number of tramps and other destitute persons\\". The poet Edna St. Vincent Millay got her middle name from the hospital, where her uncle's life was saved in 1892 after he was accidentally locked in the hold of a ship for several days without food or water. =20th century= The school received its certification from the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York in 1905, one of the first such schools to be so recognized. In 1911, St. Vincent's Ambulance, manned by hospital interns, responded to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in Manhattan, where the attendants watched helplessly as those trapped in the fire jumped to their deaths onto the street below. In 1912, St. Vincent's received and treated victims after the sinking of the , while mourning the loss of attending physician Francis Norman O'Loughlin, who died in the disaster. A plaque honoring his memory stood in the hospital's main entrance as a reminder of his dedication and sacrifice.On the hospital's treatment of Titanic survivors, see and In 1968, under William Grace, Director of Medicine at St. Vincent's, and his associate John A. Chadbourn, the hospital established the nation's first Mobile Coronary Care Unit (MCCU) following an example in Ireland. It was configured on a white over red 1968 Chevrolet Step-Van and utilized a portable battery-powered defibrillator/monitor; a battery-powered electrocardiograph, I.V. kit, resuscitation/oxygen kit, and a drug kit. The success of the St. Vincent's MCCU project inspired the development of the \\"HeartMobile\\" in Columbus, Ohio, and similar programs in Marietta, Georgia, Montgomery County, Maryland, and Los Angeles in 1970. In 1975, when the Puerto Rican extremist nationalist group FALN bombed Fraunces Tavern in the Wall Street area, St. Vincent's paramedics and responders from multiple other EMS agencies transported patients to St. Vincent's Hospital for trauma care. In the 1980s, as the gay population of Greenwich Village and New York began succumbing to the AIDS virus, St. Vincent's established the first AIDS ward on the East Coast and second only to one in San Francisco, and soon became \\"Ground Zero\\" for the AIDS-afflicted in NYC.Boynton, Andrew. \\"Remembering St. Vincent's\\", The New Yorker, May 16, 2013. The hospital \\"became synonymous\\" with care for AIDS patients in the 1980s, particularly poor gay men and drug users. It became one of the best hospitals in the state for AIDS care with a large research facility and dozens of doctors and nurses working on it. ACT UP protested the hospital one night in the 1980s due to its Catholic nature. They took over the emergency room and covered crucifixes with condoms in an effort to both raise awareness and to offend Catholics. Instead of pressing charges, the sisters who ran the hospital decided to meet with the protesters to better understand their concerns. =21st century= The SVCMC network was formed in 2000, when St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan, formerly the St. Vincent Hospital and Medical Center of New York, merged with the Catholic Medical Centers of Brooklyn and Queens and Sisters of Charity Healthcare on Staten Island, which included St. Vincent's Hospital (Staten Island), Mary Immaculate Hospital in Queens, St. John's Queens Hospital, Saint Joseph's Hospital in Queens, St. Mary's Hospital of Brooklyn, and Bayley Seton Hospital in Staten Island. The mergers were intended to reduce costs by improved efficiency and elimination reductant administration, however, it also brought increased debt with the member hospitals.Clarke, Kevin. \\"The Last Days Of St. Vincents: A venerable New York institution closes its doors.\\", America, July 05, 2010 St. Vincent's was the primary admitting hospital for those injured in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center.Morowitz, Matthew. \\"Many Layers of History at 7th Avenue and 12th Street: St. Vincent‚Äôs Hospital\\", Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, July 12, 2018 Pictures of the missing collected in such large numbers that the hospital dedicated an entire outside wall to protect them. The Wall of Hope and Remembrance was maintained for years. Many hospitals closed soon afterward. In 2003 St. Clare's Hospital was affiliated, and renamed St. Vincent's Hospital (Midtown), but it closed on August 1, 2007. St. Mary's Hospital of Brooklyn closed on September 23, 2005; Mary Immaculate and St. John's closed on March 1, 2009, after being sold to Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in 2006. Closing In 2005, under financial pressure from its charity involvements and rising costs, the SVCMC system filed for bankruptcy. The system launched an aggressive reorganization effort, selling or transferring its money-losing facilities and focusing development on its main hospital, which allowed it to emerge from bankruptcy in the summer of 2007. In the name of modernizing and restructuring, it also announced plans to build a new Manhattan hospital across the street, with a planned opening set for 2011. Part of this redevelopment was to include construction of a billion-dollar residential condominium by the Rudin real estate family. The plan was a source of contention with several neighborhood groups, such as the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation and the Municipal Art Society. The Landmarks Preservation Commission approved the residential components of the plan in July 2009, but by then residential development financing was no longer available because of the global financial crisis. The New York State Department of Health said there is no need for an acute care hospital in Greenwich Village. St. Vincent's announced on January 27, 2010, that its financial situation had soured further and desperate measures would be required to keep the hospital open. Senators, city council members and congressional representatives all became involved in attempting to save the hospital. A Greater New York Hospital Association spokesman pointed to health budget cuts in Albany. The hospital entered discussions with Continuum Health Partners (the parent corporation of Beth Israel Medical Center, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, and New York Eye and Ear Infirmary) and with Mount Sinai Hospital to consider taking ownership of the hospital, but both ultimately declined. On April 6, 2010, the board of directors voted to close inpatient care services at St. Vincent's Catholic Medical Center, and to sell its outpatient services to other systems. The emergency room stopped accepting ambulances on April 9, 2010, and delivered its last baby on April 15, 2010. On April 19, 2010, more than 1,000 staff, representing approximately one-third of the hospital workforce, received notice of lay-off. On April 14, 2010, St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The petition, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, showed liabilities of more than $1 billion. On April 30, 2010, the emergency room at St. Vincent's closed, officially shuttering the hospital after 161 years. Hospital administrators said that the vote to close came after a six-month-long effort to save the financially troubled institution, but August 21, 2011, prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office were reported to have launched an investigation to determine whether administrators intentionally ran St. Vincent's into the ground. The remaining parts of Saint Vincent Catholic Medical Centers, including its nursing homes, home health agency, St. Vincent's Hospital Westchester, and US Family Health Plan, were to continue to operate without interruption, but these entities were sold to other providers' systems. =Post-closure= In October 2011, the former main campus at 7-15 Seventh Avenue was sold to Rudin Management Company for $260 million. CBRE Group represented the seller, Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Centers. Eyal Ofer's Global Holdings assisted the buyer in the sale. At the time of its closure, St. Vincent's occupied a large real-estate footprint in Greenwich Village; it consisted of several hospital buildings and a number of outpatient facilities, had more than 1,000 affiliated physicians, including 70 full-time and 300 voluntary attending physicians, and trained more than 300 residents and fellows annually. As a Catholic hospital, St. Vincent's was officially sponsored by the Sisters of Charity and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn. St. Vincent's was the last Catholic general hospital in New York City. The St. Vincent de Paul stained glass window from the hospital was donated to St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center in Paterson, New Jersey, in honor of its legacy of charity. It is on display in the main lobby of the medical center. The building was completely demolished by early 2013. New York City has announced a deal that preserves a historic building and creates a new school on the site. Former City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said that the plan also calls for a reduction in the number of new apartments, funds for affordable housing and arts education in local schools. Medical education SVCMC served as one of two academic medical centers of New York Medical College. It offered a well-respected residency and fellowship program, and also served as a clerkship facility for students of medicine, nursing, physical therapy, and occupational therapy: ;Residencies :Anesthesiology, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Family Practice, Combined Internal Medicine & Pediatrics, Primary Care, Neurology, Neurosurgery, Nuclear Medicine, OB/GYN, Ophthalmology, Orthopedics, Pathology, PM&R;, Psychiatry, Child Psychiatry, Radiology, General Surgery, Transitional. ;Fellowships :Cardiology, Critical Care, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Interventional Endoscopy, Geriatrics, Hematology/Oncology, Infectious Disease, Pulmonary. ;Allied Health Programs :CPR, Advanced Life Support, EMT, Paramedics, Nuclear Medicine Technology.

Kennedy Medical also provided 24/7 paramedic New York State-certified first responder services to the Port Authority to supplement the PA Police EMS division. Kennedy Medical Offices treated dignitaries, politicians, Hollywood stars, and VIP's from around the world (including security details for the President of the US and the Pope as well as heads of many other nations). * Several outpatient medical and substance abuse treatment centers in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Westchester and the Bronx. Notable programs=St. Vincent's HIV Center St. Vincent's was the epicenter of New York City's AIDS epidemic. It housed the first and largest AIDS ward on the east coast and is often referred to as the \\"ground zero\\" of the AIDS epidemic. As one of the first institutions to address and treat HIV and AIDS in the 1980s, St. Vincent's HIV Center was one of the oldest, most experienced and most renowned HIV treatment programs in the US. It provided coordinated outpatient and inpatient primary care and case management services to HIV-positive adults, pregnant women, and children, and also provided HIV prevention services, AIDS education programs, HIV clinical research, and support groups. In addition, SVCMC developed the unique Airbridge Project, which coordinates care for HIV-positive patients who make frequent trips to Puerto Rico. Father Mychal Judge ministered to Catholics dying of AIDS in the early years of the epidemic. Tony Kushner features the hospital in his play Angels in America. Chinese Outreach Program Due to its proximity to Chinatown, Manhattan, two miles away, SVCMC had close ties to the Chinese community throughout its history. In an effort to reach this underserved population, the hospital opened an independent Chinese-speaking inpatient unit, which employed physicians and nurses who spoke Cantonese and Mandarin. They also opened an outpatient facility in Chinatown, provided a free shuttle service from Chinatown to the hospital, and offered Chinese-focused healthcare services such as Acupuncture and Chinese traditional meals. Cystic Fibrosis Program One of the most comprehensive and renowned CF programs in the city, the Saint Vincent's Cystic Fibrosis therapy program offered care for patients with cystic fibrosis and attracted patients from around the region. Perinatal Hospice Center The Perinatal Hospice was founded in 2007 to meet the needs of parents who discover early in pregnancy that their baby is nonviable outside the womb, and yet chose to carry their baby to term. John J. Conley Department of Ethics Closely linked to the Bioethics Institute at New York Medical College, The Conley Ethics Department was a leader in the study of clinical medical ethics and spirituality in healthcare. Chaired by Dr. Daniel Sulmasy, the department strove to integrate the biopsychosocial model of healthcare within the SVCMC system. Elizabeth Ann Seton Chapel Because the hospital was founded and manned through much of its history by nuns, its hospital chapel was a primary focus of the hospital architecture, and was symbolically nested at the very center of the hospital. The Chapel, named for St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, offered daily Mass and refuge for patients and hospital staff. Hospital Pet Care Program Responding to the unique needs of an urban population, SVCMC instituted a program to help patients provide for the pets during their stay in the hospital. Animals were either walked and fed in patient's home, or were relocated to care facilities or short-term foster homes. Comprehensive Cancer Center The Comprehensive Cancer Center provided prevention, diagnosis, treatment and recovery of a variety of malignancies, with a focus on preventing inpatient stays through careful outpatient monitoring. Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, even stem cell transplants were provided as day procedures, along with 24-hour emergency care.

Biography Schulte was born in Fort Madison, Iowa. He received his classical education from St. Francis Seminary in Milwaukee, and studied for the priesthood at St. John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota. He was ordained a priest on December 28, 1881, by Bishop John McMullen, first bishop of the Diocese of Davenport, at St. Margaret's Cathedral. He was the first priest ordained for the diocese. After ordination Schulte worked as a cathedral assistant before he was slated by McMullen to organize St. Ambrose College. The school had 40 high school students during the first year, and 85 students when he left. In addition to his administrative responsibilities he taught Latin, German and rhetoric. During Schulte's presidency, the central portion of Ambrose Hall was built. In 1889 he was appointed to a committee to promote and ensure quality education in the schools of the diocese by Bishop Henry Cosgrove. After leaving St. Ambrose College, Schulte took a pastorate at St. Mary's Church in Iowa City. He would spend nearly 50 years as pastor of St. Mary's during which time many expansion and improvement projects were undertaken. He also focused his attention on the parish school. At the very beginning of his pastorate the present rectory was built in 1892. The same year he purchased property for a new school and the new building was built the following year. High school grades were added to the school in 1897, and Schulte saw to it that the school was accredited by the State University of Iowa. It was the first Catholic high school is the state to receive the accreditation. The church was renovated and redecorated from 1907-1908. An addition was built on to the school in 1911, which included an auditorium and cafeteria, and a new convent was built for the Sisters who taught in the school in 1926. Bishop Henry Rohlman nominated Schulte for papal honors twice. In 1927 Pope Pius XI named Schulte a Domestic Prelate, and in 1931 named him a Protonotary Apostolic. Both honors allowed Schulte the use of the title Right Reverend Monsignor. Msgr. Schulte died while still pastor at St. Mary's on January 17, 1940, and was buried in St. Joseph's Cemetery in Iowa City. He was 81 years old. He does have some relatives living in Iowa today.
