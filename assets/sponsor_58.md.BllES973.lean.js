Career Findlay was educated at Harrow School and joined the Diplomatic Service as an Attach√© in 1885. He served at Stockholm, Constantinople, Vienna, Buenos Aires and Belgrade. He was Minister Resident at Dresden and Coburg 1907‚Äì09, and Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at Sofia 1909‚Äì11 and at Christiania 1911‚Äì23, including the important period of World War I. :Christiania, which up till 1914 was an extremely pleasant post for a Minister who happened to be fond of fishing, became, on the outbreak of the War, one of intense and arduous difficulty. The problem that increasingly dominated Findlay's work was the double problem of the blockade of Germany and the passage of goods in transit to Russia. The normal difficulties of exercising control over the imports into neutral countries so as to ensure that a surplus over and above their own needs did not go on to fatten Germany, a control that was resisted by all the neutrals and took years to perfect, were enormously increased in the Scandinavian countries by the fact, little realized by critics, that pressure by Great Britain was apt to provoke interference in the free transit to Russia of arms, munitions, and other essential war supplies. Findlay in Christiania, like Howard in Stockholm, had to act with the greatest circumspection, and in his multifarious negotiations with the Norwegian Government, trade trusts, and individual firms, had to contrive to get the maximum harm done to German interests with the minimum harm to Russian and Allied interests. The full effect of his work was understood by few people outside the Contraband Department of the Foreign Office. It was certainly not understood by the general public. ‚Äî The Times, 2 January 1933 R. H. Bruce Lockhart described Findlay as \\"one of the tallest Englishmen in the world and certainly the tallest man in diplomacy. He was a good organiser and, aided by Charles Brudenell-Bruce, ran his huge Legation (Christiania, in peace time a diplomatic backwater, had, owing to the blockade, the largest staff of any Legation or Embassy during the war) with great efficiency.\\"R.H. Bruce Lockhart, Memoirs of a British Agent, Putnam, London, 1932 In October 1914 Sir Roger Casement, an Irish nationalist, travelled to Germany via Norway with a companion named Adler Christensen. Accounts of what happened in Christiania differ. Casement's version was that Christensen was taken to the British legation and that Findlay offered him a reward if Casement was \\"knocked on the head\\".Charles Curry (ed.), Sir Roger Casement's diaries: His mission to Germany and the Findlay affair (1922) pp.41-54 However, his version is contradicted by documents released years later by the British security services.Angus Mitchell, Casement, (Haus Publishing, 2003) pp.98-100 British records suggest that Christensen approached the British Legation voluntarily with a plan to betray Casement, was given a small amount of money, and was offered a large amount for information that would lead to Casement's capture.Handwritten statement by Mansfeldt de Cardonnel Findlay, H.B.M. Minister, British Legation at Christiania, Norway promising to pay Adler Christensen the sum of ¬£5,000 for the provision of information that would lead to the capture of Roger Casement, University College Dublin Digital Library Honours Mansfeldt Findlay was appointed CMG in 1904, CB in 1908, knighted KCMG in 1916 and given the additional knighthood of GBE in 1924 on his retirement. The King of Norway awarded him the Grand Cross of the Order of St Olaf.

Whitmer and Colby Corino. The name \\"Decade\\" was chosen because all three original members of the stable (Whitmer, Jimmy Jacobs, and Roderick Strong) had been associated with Ring of Honor for ten years when the group was formed.  History  On December 14, 2013, at Final Battle 2013 Eddie Edwards and B.J. Whitmer defeated Roderick Strong and Jay Lethal in Edwards' farewell match. After the match Whitmer turned on Edwards and attacked him alongside Strong and Jimmy Jacobs. After the match Jacobs cut a promo explaining how he was sick of wrestlers being praised for leaving ROH to jump to bigger wrestling promotions (i.e. TNA or WWE). In a promo the Decade antagonized any wrestler who came back to Ring of Honor after leaving other wrestling companies and younger talents who want to use ROH as a stepping stone to reach bigger wrestling promotions. On the episode of January 18, the Decade asked Mark Briscoe to join the stable and attacked Adam Page. Briscoe refused and teamed up with Page, leading to a tag team match against Jacobs and Whitmer. The Decade won the match. On March 7, 2014, Adam Page joined The Decade, as the first of the recruits, or \\"young boys.\\" On April 19 TaDarius Thomas joined The Decade, as the second. At Death Before Dishonor XII Adam Pearce would become a temporary member and beat TaDarius Thomas on Night 1, but lost to Adam Page on Night 2. On September 27, Thomas would quit The Decade after turning on Jacobs. Roderick Strong was ousted from The Decade after falling out with Adam Page, Strong then fended off an attack from Page and Whitmer to set up a match for Final Battle which Page was defeated. After promoting Page to a full-time member, Whitmer successfully recruited Colby Corino, the 18-year-old son of Whitmer rival Steve Corino to join the Decade. This caused friction between Jacobs and Whitmer, feeling that taking Corino's son was too much, leading to Jacobs leaving the Decade and facing Whitmer at Supercard of Honor IX, with Whitmer coming out on top. This was done to facilitate Jacobs real-life departure from ROH for a writing career with WWE. The group would disband in early 2016, after Whitmer turned on Corino.

Later, as director of the Transvaal Museum, he together with Charles Koch helped to establish the Namib Desert Research Institute in Gobabeb Family Vivian FitzSimons came from a family of naturalists. His father, Frederick William FitzSimons, and his mother Patricia Henrietta (n√©e Russell), both immigrated to South Africa from Ireland. His brother was Desmond Charles Fitzsimons, who in 1939 founded the Fitzsimons Snake Park (Durban) and was a leading distributor of snake antivenoms in South Africa.

He is especially known for his work in the Neohellenic Studies field, in which he devoted the greatest part of his study and research, especially focusing on the Greek Revolution through the mid-20th century period.  Biography = Early life and studies Dakin was born in Gloucestershire, England. His father was headmaster at the school of that town; when, in 1920, the Rendcomb College was founded near Cirencester, his father sent him there to study. In 1926 Dakin went up to Peterhouse, Cambridge with a scholarship, where he studied history. He then, started teaching for the first time in 1931, at the Haberdashers' Aske's School, London. Dakin then began his PhD, on Anne-Robert- Jacques Turgot at the Birkbeck College of the University of London.  Academic career and World War II  In 1935, Dakin was appointed lecturer in the Birkbeck College. Though his Turgot and the Ancien R√©gime work was published in 1939, a distinguished achievement for a scholar of his age, his main academic interests shifted from France to modern Greece; the cause of this was Dakin's military service during World War II in Greece. Dakin had joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR) and served in Egypt and Greece as the liaison officer to the Royal Hellenic Air force and also had been involved with the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS). In 1945 he returned to the UK from the middle East and was posted in the Allied/Foreign Liaison Section of the British Air Ministry.  Neohellenic studies  After the end of the war, Darkin returned to the Birkbeck College where additional duties as an archivist were assigned to him. He faced bureaucracy with humour and parallel to his popular night classes on the post-Napoleonic French Congress and his supervisory duties of postgraduate students, acquiring for both the fame of an enlightened and respected teacher. His main work centered on modern Greek history for which Paul, king of Greece, awarded him the Golden Cross of the Order of the Phoenix; Darkin was also named an honorary doctor of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and from 1971 a fellow of the Athens Academy. Following the foundation of the University of Cyprus, Darkin donated to it a big part of its book collection, consisting of about 850 titles; he then became and remained involved with the Cypriot Centre for Scientific Studies.

From there they followed a course southwestward to Guadalupe Pass and the Janos - Fronteras Road they followed west to the San Pedro River, following it northward before turning west to Mescal Spring and Tucson, pioneering the route known as Cooke's Wagon Road. By 1849, Cooke's road became the major southern route of the forty- niners during the California Gold Rush and Ojo de Vaca spring was one of the reliable watering places on what became the Southern Emigrant Trail.

The agricultural sector is equivalent to 13.6% of the labor force. Agriculture and farm diversification has taken place mostly by smaller farms. Between 1982 and 1983, floods claimed the lives of Santa Catarina. The result of the flooding occurred in losses of more than Cr$ 900 billion. The floods in 1984 and the strength of a drought in 1985-1986 were the agents that caused the punishment of economics and population. Corn is the main wealth produced by the state. The corn crop is present throughout the territory, especially in the highlands. In 2012, maize production in Santa Catarina was 2,870,450 t, and the eighth largest producer of corn Brazilian state. Cassava is another major wealth produced by the state (529 648 t) and its presence spreads its whole territory. As a cultural reference, the coffee branch appears in the coat of arms of Santa Catarina because it was formerly cultivated in coastal state. In 2012, Santa Catarina was the sixth Brazilian state that produced more beans (115,719 t), the first that produced the most onions (376.603 t), the first that produced the most garlic (19,315) and the second most produced tobacco (237 213 t). Santa Catarina also produces rice, sugarcane, soybean, wheat, tomato and irish potato.

This was the last budget presented by the Finance Minister before his resignation in March and death in April. At the end of the fiscal year, the government was surprised to post a budgetary surplus of $1.9 billion. This however would later be overturned to a small deficit of $550 million due to improper accounting methodologies for the Government's unfunded pension obligations, as pointed out for years by the Auditor General. Programs The budget cut from the Department of National Defence budget allocated for procurement of equipment via the Canada First Defence Strategy. Flaherty stated the funds would be restored in the future when \\"key purchases will be made\\". The government announced a plan to establish the National Disaster Mitigation Program, which it would begin funding in the 2015‚Äì2016 fiscal year under the 2015 budget. The program \\"will invest in structural mitigation projects\\" and provide residential flood insurance in conjunction with provincial, territorial, and private insurance plans. The budget established the Canada First Research Excellence Fund, which was to receive $50 million in the 2015‚Äì2016 fiscal year for research funding at post-secondary institutions. Four grant councils, including the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, would receive a combined $46 million annually. Taxes and tariffs The proposed budget increased excise taxes on cigars, cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and tobacco sticks, and also imposed a tax increase on duty-free tobacco products. Flaherty stated that the increase was to account for the effects of inflation since 2002, and would be indexed to inflation every five years. the Tax took effect 12 February 2014. The budget allocated $92 million of tobacco tax revenues over five years to establish the Geospatial Intelligence and Automated Dispatch Centre and to install sensors to detect movement of contraband tobacco products in high-risk areas. The budget included a reduction in sick leave benefits for public servants, a doubling of the Public Service Health Care Plan premium for retired civil servants, and increasing eligibility requirements to reduce enrollment in the program. The government said it also expected to replace the sick leave benefit program with a short- term disability program in future collective bargaining with public sector unions, and included in the budget the expected compensation savings from that change. The small business hiring tax credit was eliminated by the budget, as was a tariff for mobile offshore drilling systems. The tax credit for adopting children was increased to . Search and rescue personnel with 200 hours of service per year received a tax credit similar to that received by volunteer fire fighters in the 2011 budget. \\"Immigration trusts\\" were eliminated by the budget. These trusts were used by immigrants to shelter investment income from Canadian income tax. Graduated tax rates for testamentary trusts were also eliminated. Business The Automotive Innovation Fund was increased by $500 million over two years. The budget also allocated $78 million per year for five years for the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to improve inspections and establish the Food Safety Information Network. The budget bill also included a proposal to update some regulations. The Food and Drug Regulations would be amended to redefine the term beer to \\"reflect innovation\\" in brewing. It updated the compositional standards, allowing the use of flavouring ingredients such as nutmeg by craft breweries. Intellectual property laws relating to trademarks, service marks, and patents were changed for consistency with the Madrid Protocol, the Singapore Treaty, the Nice Agreement, the Patent Law Treaty, and the Hague Agreement. The budget document also stated that Service Canada would operate the Canada Job Grant, which had been announced in the 2013 federal budget, in jurisdictions with which the federal government failed to secure agreements.

Any interested individual, history and heritage society, museum, or commercial organisation can join CCHT. General The aim of CCHT is to initiate a step-change in the awareness and understanding of Cumbria‚Äôs local historical heritage, by harnessing the enthusiasm for local history which exists widely across Cumbria, and pooling expertise. Its ultimate aim is to write the history of every town and village in England. To date, a team of over 100 volunteers from across Cumbria has compiled brief histories for each of the 348 parishes/townships in the county, using the Civil Parishes as they existed around 1900. Edited versions of these histories can be found on each place page of on the CCHT website and have been published as a book, Cumbria: An Historical Gazetteer. In addition, a smaller core of volunteers has been researching and writing full parish/township histories, in the standard style of the Victoria County History. Please see the Completed Draft Histories section on the project website for more details about their progress. Our first VCH parish history was published in March 2018 and covers the three fellside villages of Kirkowald, Staffield and Renwick. See Richard Brockington and Sarah Rose, The Victoria History of Cumberland: Kirkoswald and Renwick (University of London, 2019). Early Work No VCH town or village histories had been published for the historic counties of Cumberland and Westmorland before the VCH Cumbria project was launched in 2010; the only parts of Cumbria previously to have been researched in detail by the VCH were those parts which were formerly in Lancashire. The story of the early attempts to publish a VCH for Cumberland and Westmorland has been told by John Beckett in a paper in the Transactions of the Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and archaeological Society, New Series, vol XI, (2011) pp. 207‚Äì225 Lancashire The Furness and Cartmel areas (Lonsdale North of the Sands) were covered in VCH Lancashire, Volume VIII (published in 1910) Cumberland Two introductory volumes were published in the early twentieth century, Volume 1 (1901), which covered Early Man, Pre-Norman Remains, Introduction to and Texts of the Cumberland Domesday, Early Pipe Rolls, and Testa de Nevill and Volume II (1905) which covered Political History, Industries, Sport Ancient and Modern, Forestry. The first VCH parish history of Cumberland was published in March 2018 - Richard Brockington and Sarah Rose, The Victoria History of Cumberland: Kirkoswald and Renwick (University of London, 2019). Westmorland Nothing has been published to date  Resources  The CCHT website aims to be the major online source for the history of Cumbria. Included among the many resources on there is a full transcript of Cumbrian Census figures from 1801 to 2001, by ward. Each place page contains links to a number of place-specific sources, including the most relevant papers in the CWAAS Transactions. There is a range of images available for download from the Gallery, including images taken from: * Hutchinson's History of the County of Cumberland, Vol 1 1794 * Sketches and photographs from sketchbook compiled by Joseph Hall (1839-1899) of Parkgate, Waverton: Cumbria Archive Centre, Carlisle, DX 1065/50 * Aqua- tints and engravings from Thomas West's \\"A Guide to the Lakes in Cumberland, Westmorland and Lancashire\\", 6th edn, 1796 * Aqua-tints and engravings from Thomas West's \\"A Guide to the Lakes in Cumberland, Westmorland and Lancashire\\", 6th edn, 1796 * Illustrations by A Reginald Smith from W G Collingwood 'The Lake Counties', (New Edition 1932) * Old Maps of Cumbria Gallery: extracts of old printed maps showing Cumbria. All the maps illustrated are in private ownership and there are no copyright restrictions on their use * Engravings from Thomas Pennant's Tour from Downing to Alston Moor 1801 Ortelius Cumbria Map  Project Direction  All the work on the Victoria County History of Cumbria project is being done by volunteers, under the overall direction of Dr Fiona Edmonds Director of the Regional Heritage Centre at Lancaster University and with volunteer guidance and support provided by Dr Sarah Rose, Assistant Editor. Volunteers are provided training to ensure that the high standards of scholarship expected from the Victoria County History are maintained, and that the output, both Digests and Draft Histories, provides a factual, reliable and authoritative work of reference for everyone with an interest in the history of their town or village - and possibly their family too. A practical guide for volunteers contributing to the Victoria County History (Cumbria) Project has been published and is freely available. It contains guidance on all aspects of researching and writing the history of a parish or township for the VCH, drawing attention to sources and themes of particular relevance to the history of local communities in Cumbria.  Trustees  The Cumbria County History Trust (CCHT) is a registered charity (Charity Registration Number 1137379).

Ayungua Su√°rez was born in T√°mbani An√°pu, Michoac√°n but moved to Patamban, an indigenous community at the base of a small mountain of the same name in the Tanganc√≠cuaro Mountains, where Pur√©pecha is still spoken. The town is noted for its green glazed ceramics, especially platters, plates, jars, pineapple shaped storage containers and many other items. He attended school only until the second year of primary as he had to work the family‚Äôs corn and vegetable fields. Only much later did he learn to read, forced by the need to read road signs in his later travels to sell his wares. At age 21, he married Ana Mar√≠a Cuevas, who taught him how to make ceramics. The artisan at one point tried to migrate to the United States but could not pass the border, so worked in Tonal√°, Jalisco for a few months. There he learned about firing methods and how to keep pieces from sticking together. When he returned to Patamban, he not only used the techniques himself but also taught family and neighbors. Ayungua Su√°rez and his wife have been making pottery full time since 1974. Today, he is the best-known artisan in Patamban, commonly known as Tat√° (grandfather) Tal√≠. Ayungua Su√°rez¬¥s works range from tiny miniatures to large cooking vessels and have a combination of dark and light green coloring along with white and rust. They are decorated with black, red and white. Working on a heavy wood table, he works clay from local sources, which has been cleaned and pulverized by hand. He uses molds he has made himself of plaster or fired clay with certain elements such as texturizing the pineapple pieces done by hand. The pieces are covered in a slip and fired the first time. After cooling the pieces are glazed and fired again, which is more delicate process and more pieces are lost. He has worked to get government cooperation for local artisans as head of the Tata Tal√≠ artisans‚Äô group. In 2001, his work was recognized by being named a ‚Äúgrand master‚Äù by the Fomento Cultural Banamex . In 2008, the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Colima honored him with an exhibition and award ceremony.

Plot Forced to give up his land and his only home, cantankerous Texas rancher Red Bovie (Robert Duvall) isn't about to go quietly to the dismal trailer park that's all he can now afford, and instead goes off with his grandson Gally (son of his long-estranged son Jimmy) for a road trip to Old Mexico. They pick up two hitch-hikers who have stolen over $150,000 in drug money. But after Red drives off without them, unbeknownst to him the money remains in the car. They arrive in Mexico, still pursued by the drug dealers, who are pursued in turn by another hit-man looking to recover the stolen money. Red and Gally enjoy the town's attractions during the Mexican festival of the dead. As night falls, they visit a brothel where Red dances with the madame. They later meet a singer named Patty Wafers who is down on her luck. She is immediately attracted to Red's fearless and outrageous behavior. Meanwhile, the hit-man kills the American drug dealers and is now in pursuit of Red. Red discovers the money and desires to keep it so that he can have a better life than the one promised by the trailer park. Patty tries to help them return undetected across the border with the money, but the hit-man catches up with them and takes it. They pursue him, then they pursue another hit-man who has taken the money in turn. As Red and Patty's affection grows, Red begins to lose interest, but Gally, seeking his identity after the death of his father, takes up the pursuit in his place. They eventually overpower the second hit man and recover the money. Patty invites Red to live with her in her small town where she was born in northern Mexico. He accepts and is happy to go with her, knowing that with $150,000, they will live like royalty.

Because of its high level of sophistication and professionalism, and a target list that included diplomatic offices and embassies, Careto is believed to be the work of a nation state. Kaspersky believes that the creators of the malware were Spanish-speaking. Because of the focus on Spanish-speaking victims, the heavy targeting of Morocco, and the targeting of Gibraltar, Bruce Schneier speculates that Careto is operated by Spain. Payload Careto normally installs a second and more complex backdoor program called SGH. SGH is easily modifiable and also has a wider arsenal including the ability to intercept system events, file operations, and performing a wider range of surveillance features. The information gathered by SGH and Careto can include encryption keys, virtual private network configurations, and SSH keys and other communication channels. Detection and removal Careto is hard to discover and remove because of its use of stealth capabilities. In addition, most of the samples have been digitally signed. The signatures are issued from a Bulgarian company, TecSystem Ltd., but the authenticity of the company is unknown. One of the issued certificates was valid between June 28, 2011 and June 28, 2013. Another was valid from April 18, 2013 to July 18, 2016, but was revoked by Verisign.http://securelist.com/blog/research/58254/the-caretomask-apt- frequently-asked-questions/ Careto was discovered when it made attempts to circumvent Kaspersky security products. Upon discovery of Careto trying to exploit their software, Kaspersky started to investigate further. As part of collecting statistics, multiple sinkholes were placed on the command and control servers. Currently most up-to-date antivirus software can discover and successfully remove the malware. Distribution On investigation of the command and control servers, discoveries showed that more than 380 victims were infected. From the information that has been uncovered, the victims were infected with the malware by clicking on a spear phishing link which redirected to websites that had software that Careto could exploit, such as Adobe Flash Player. The player has since been patched and is no longer exploitable by Careto. The websites that contained the exploitable software had names similar to popular newspapers, such as The Washington Post and The Independent. The malware is said to have multiple backdoors to Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Evidence of a possible fourth type of backdoor to Android and IOS was discovered on the C&C; servers, but no samples were found. It is estimated that Careto has been compiled as far back as 2007. It is now known that the attacks ceased in January 2014.

Estimated to be about 1000 years old, it one of the oldest Sub-saharan sculptures yet discovered in Africa. Since 1931, it has been part of the British Museum's ethnographic collection. Description The Luzira Head is a unique terracotta bust of a woman. The head has very narrow, protruding eyes and mouth with a diminutive nose. Along the forehead are three cicatrices. The hair is matted and falls either side of the head. The lower part of the figure was also found during the original excavations. It is tripod-shaped and like the head is hollow and made of baked clay. Discovery The head and torso, along with a number of other artefacts, were excavated by the British geologist EJ Wayland between 1929 and 1930. They were unearthed in a prison compound at the site of Luzira, in the suburbs of Kampala, Uganda. Other objects discovered at the time included over one hundred pottery sherds, fourteen terracotta pieces, a pottery vessel, an iron spear and an axe similar to the story of Ibrahim and the idols. But unfortunately the where abouts of the Luzira axe are unknown.It is conjectured that the site was once an ancient Buganda shrine. Radio-carbon dating has indicated that the objects found there are approximately a thousand years old.

EPIC‚Äôs name is an acronym which stands for ‚ÄúElectrical, Process, Instrumentation and Control Systems‚Äù. EPIC was founded in 1995 as a privately held automation firm and has grown to include divisions for complete modular process plants and systems, integrated packaging and assembly lines, custom machinery manufacturing, and machine vision system integration. In 2009, EPIC saw a 21% growth rate within three years. Revenue grew exponentially during this time period (2005-2008), and the company had 50 employees. EPIC is ranked by Inc. 500 as a Top 100 Fastest Growing Engineering Company (#71 United States) and Top 100 Fastest Growing Missouri Company (#55) EPIC is also listed by the St. Louis Post Dispatch as one of the ‚ÄúTop Places to Work‚Äù in St. Louis for 2013. History=Early Years In 1995, two partners, John R. Schott, P.E. and Matt Quinn, founded EPIC with $1,000 in personal savings. The two founders were both experienced plant engineers, and founded EPIC to service the manufacturing industries with which they were familiar. They formed the acronym ‚ÄúEPIC‚Äù from the words \\"Electrical, Process, Instrumentation and Control Systems\\", which described the firm‚Äôs original focus on automation and controls for process systems. The company was founded in St. Louis, MO and provided consulting, design engineering services and automation for process plants and packing line integration. Two years after opening, in 1997, EPIC expanded by adding a fabrication plant to support the design and construction of modular process plants. This marked the expansion from consulting, automation and design to the four distinct divisions of EPIC that exist currently. The new facility allowed for in-house fabrication and construction management services. EPIC began offering complete design/build of process plants to industrial clients in 1999. Rapid Expansion In 2001, EPIC was named a FAST 50 Newcomer by St. Louis Commerce Magazine. In 2004, EPIC was recognized as one of St. Louis‚Äôs fastest growing private companies by receiving two different growth- based awards: The Regional Technology Award and the St. Louis Fast 50 Technology Award. EPIC went on to become a three-time winner of the Regional Technology Award and a four-time winner of the Fast 50 Technology Award. During this same time period, EPIC grew from a company of two employees (the owners), to approximately 30 employees. EPIC moved into an expanded 40,000 sq ft facility in 2004, which is the current location of the business. The new building in St. Louis, Missouri, features two separate facilities dedicated to the separation of industrial and sanitary applications. This feature follows ASME Bioprocessing Equipment guidelines, isolating the shop for carbon steel and stainless (high alloy) fabrication. In 2008 a line integration division was added to EPIC, specializing in complete design/build of packaging and assembly lines. A custom machine group was also formed within EPIC, focused on manufacturing hard-to-find or non-existent machines. That same year, EPIC began giving the annual ‚ÄúEPIC Way Award‚Äù to recognize one outstanding employee who best exemplifies the spirit and values upon which EPIC was founded. Restructuring and Continued Growth By 2009, EPIC had seen a 21% growth rate within three years. Revenue grew exponentially during this time period (2005-2008), and the company had expanded to 50 employees. In 2009, one of the original founders of EPIC, Matt Quinn, sold his half of EPIC to the other owner, John Schott, making Schott the sole owner and President of EPIC Systems. EPIC expanded their automation services again in 2011 with the addition of the Insta-Panel control system. The Insta-Panel consisted of a standard control box equipped with a flexible HMI. The company marketed the Insta-Panel as an all-in-one automation tool that allows manufacturers to quickly automate or upgrade industrial systems. That same year, EPIC also released a custom turnkey medical device assembly machine for a top biotechnology company. Expansion continued in 2012 when EPIC added an additional 7,000 feet of office and manufacturing space. This expansion allowed the machine vision group to move into a larger space. Cognex awarded EPIC the ‚ÄúPartner System Integrator of the Year Award‚Äù for the highest growth nationwide of complete machine vision systems. EPIC was also a finalist in Control Engineering‚Äôs Integrator of the Year competition in 2012 and 2013. EPIC had grown to 60 employees by mid-2013. This growth was recognized by the Inc. 500 listing EPIC received. EPIC was also recognized a Top Place to Work by the St. Louis Post Dispatch in 2013. Company Overview=Business Model EPIC is an engineering and automation firm that was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. The majority of EPIC‚Äôs business is conducted in the United States, but EPIC has also implemented systems in 17 other countries including India, China, Australia, Germany, France, the U.K, The United Arab Emirates, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa. =Modular Process Systems= EPIC Systems, Inc. is a global provider of modular plant and process systems.

He has worked in both the United States and Australia, and is currently based at the University of Bristol, UK, where he is the chair of cognitive psychology at the School of Psychological Science. His research, which originally pertained to computer simulations of people's decision-making processes, recently has focused on the public's understanding of science and why people often embrace beliefs that are sharply at odds with scientific evidence. Education and career Lewandowsky received his bachelor's degree from Washington College in 1980, followed by an M.A. in 1981 and a PhD in 1985, both from the University of Toronto. He served as an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Oklahoma from 1990 to 1994, and as associate professor for one year after that. In 1995, he joined the University of Western Australia, where he became the Winthrop Professor of Psychology in 2000.Personal Website of Stephan Lewandowsky He remained there until April 2013, when he joined the University of Bristol. In 2014, he was named the first Digital Content Editor at the Psychonomic Society. In 2015, Lewandowsky was elected a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. Research=Correction of misinformation Lewandowsky has published a number of studies examining people's belief in misinformation. In 2005, he was the lead author of a study which investigated people's beliefs in assertions about the Iraq War that had been retracted officially, and which examined people's beliefs about these assertions in Australia, the United States, and Germany. He and his co-authors found that American participants in the study persisted in believing the assertions even after being informed that they had been retracted. Lewandowsky told the Wall Street Journal that the original misinformation already had become a part of the Americans' mental worldview by the time it was retracted. He also noted that \\"People who were not suspicious of the motives behind the war continued to rely on misinformation.\\" In 2012, Lewandowsky published an article in Psychological Science in the Public Interest which examined the literature on misinformation and efforts to correct it. He found a considerable amount of speculation but little concrete research into the area. With John Cook, Lewandowsky wrote \\"The Debunking Handbook\\" (2011), a review of research on debunking falsehoods and a guide to better practices for doing so. Much of \\"The Debunking Handbook\\" focuses on \\"backfire effects\\", whereby telling people that they are wrong often reinforces their prior beliefs, rather than weakening them. Climate change and conspiracy theories In 2012, Lewandowsky put forward what would later become one of his best-known studies regarding public opinion on climate change. The survey examined data from more than 1,000 readers of climate science blogs, taken from online questionnaires posted there. Lewandowsky approached five climate sceptic blogs to ask them to post the questionnaire, but they all declined to do so. The study was accepted by Psychological Science on 7 July 2012, and published in the May 2013 issue of the journal with the title, \\"NASA Faked the Moon Landing‚ÄîTherefore, (Climate) Science Is a Hoax\\". Based on a survey of visitors to global warming related blogs, Lewandowsky and his two co-authors concluded that belief in free-market economics was associated with being more likely to reject not only the mainstream scientific view of global warming, but also the mainstream scientific position on whether HIV causes AIDS and whether tobacco smoking causes lung cancer. The study also concluded that believing in a \\"cluster of conspiracy theories\\"‚Äîsuch as that the FBI was responsible for the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.‚Äîwas also associated with being more likely to reject the consensus view on global warming. Gary Marcus wrote that the paper's findings \\"fit in with a longer literature on what has come to be known as 'motivated reasoning. The reaction to the paper from global warming sceptics was overwhelmingly negative, with Joanne Nova referring to it as \\"an ad hom argument taken to its absurd extreme, rebadged as 'science'.\\" Later in 2013, Lewandowsky published another paper on a similar topic in Nature Climate Change. In that study, he and his co-authors told the study participants that 97% of climate scientists believe humans are causing global warming, and found that this significantly increased the proportion of people who believed it as well. They also reported that the effect was most discernible for those with free-market views. These findings contributed to what is now known as the Gateway Belief Model. Also in 2013, Lewandowsky and co-authors conducted another survey in which he examined the relationship between believing in conspiracy theories (such as 9/11 conspiracy theories) and rejection of various forms of science. They found that believing in such conspiracy theories was strongly associated with being more likely to reject all forms of science, such as climate change science, the safety of genetically modified foods, and the safety of vaccines. =\\"Recursive fury\\"= On 28 March 2013, Lewandowsky published \\"Recursive fury: Conspiracist ideation in the blogosphere in response to research on conspiracist ideation\\" in the journal Frontiers in Psychology. This paper described the reaction of climate change deniers to pre-publication versions of the \\"NASA Faked the Moon Landing‚ÄîTherefore, (Climate) Science Is a Hoax\\" study that he had submitted to Psychological Science in 2012. His analysis found that, of the hypotheses generated by climate change deniers in response to his 2012 study, \\"many...exhibited conspiratorial content and counterfactual thinking.\\" The Frontiers in Psychology journal received immediate complaints, and took the paper down while it carried out an investigation. The paper was retracted with a notice published in March 2014, which stated: Ars Technica reported that its questions were referred by the publishers to their lawyer, who told Ars: \\"Frontiers is concerned about solid science, and it's obviously a regret when you have to retract an article that is scientifically and ethically sound.\\" Freedom of Information requests made by DeSmogBlog had obtained copies of the complaints, which included allegations of misconduct: some used legal terms such as \\"defamatory\\". Staff of the Australian Psychological Society wrote to Lewandowsky expressing concern \\"that some scientific journals feel sufficiently threatened by potential liability fears to not publish articles with 'inconvenient information' about climate change.\\" Elaine McKewon‚Äîwho was one of the peer-reviewers of the Lewandowsky paper, in addition to being a research associate at the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism, University of Technology, Sydney‚Äîsaid that she was \\"profoundly disappointed\\" by its retraction, and that, \\"Shortly after publication, Frontiers received complaints from climate deniers who claimed they had been libeled in the paper and threatened to sue the journal unless the paper was retracted.\\" McKewon was quoted as saying that the journal had \\"caved in at the first pushback from the climate change denial community\\". The Sydney Morning Herald reported that academics had described the retraction as having \\"a chilling effect on research\\". The University of Western Australia published the paper online after doing its own risk analysis; their lawyer, Kim Heitman, said that there was no reason to take it down. After media reports about this retraction, the journal's Editorial Director Costanza Zucca and Executive Editor Fred Fenter made a joint statement on the journal's blog that \\"Frontiers did not 'cave in to threats'; in fact, Frontiers received no threats.\\" The statement said that the main reason for retraction was insufficient protection for the rights of the studied subjects. Ars Technica reported that this statement appeared to differ from the retraction notice, and according to one of the authors of the paper an anonymised version had been produced to meet the privacy concerns. Lewandowsky said that there had been a legally binding agreement on the original notice, and what he took \\"exception to is their latest statement, which is incompatible with the signed agreement and complete news to us\\". The paper is available at the web page of the University of Western Australia.uwa.edu.au/recursivefury, accessed 26 April 2014 Perception of uncertainty In May 2014, Lewandowsky published a two-part study on the relationship between uncertainty and the dangers of climate change, in which he argued that policymakers who argue that the scientific understanding of climate change is too uncertain to act are mistaken. Instead, the study argues that \\"on the contrary, uncertainty implies that the problem is more likely to be worse than expected in the absence of that uncertainty.\\" * Lewandowsky told Salon that these studies showed that \\"uncertainty also increases the likelihood of exceeding 'safe' temperature limits and the probability of failing to reach mitigation targets.\\" Global warming hiatus A 2015 study by Lewandowsky, James Risbey, and Naomi Oreskes found that there is no substantive evidence of a global warming hiatus. Psychological features cluster identified In its March 2019 edition, Scientific American published an article about his work that posited that people drawn to conspiracy theories share some psychological characteristics that may be clustered.Moyer, Melinda Wenner, People Drawn to Conspiracy Theories Share a Cluster of Psychological Features, Scientific American, March 2019 A secondary title to the article asserted: \\"Baseless theories threaten our safety and democracy.

The flag represents the Sovereign Military Order of Malta as a sovereign institution. The state flag bears a Latin cross that extends to the edges of the flag. The Flag of the Order's Works represents its humanitarian and medical activities, and it bears a white Maltese cross on a red field. Both flags together represent the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Its constitution states: \\"The flag of the Order bears either the white latin cross on a red field or the white eight-pointed cross (cross of Malta) on a red field.\\" History Banners of the order at the Siege of Rhodes (1480), shown as gules a cross argent, and as counter-quarterly gules a cross argent and or a cross ancr√©e gules (c. 1483). The banner of the Knights Hospitaller was introduced in 1130, on the order of Pope Innocent III, for disambiguation from the Templars who used the reversed colours. The \\"eight-pointed cross\\" is also said to originate in the 12th century, under Raymond du Puy (this was at first a cross fourch√©e or cross ancr√©e, and developed into the fully articulated Maltese cross only around or after 1500).Bernard Berthod, Grandes figures de l'Ordre de Malte, Art√®ge Editions (2010) p. 17. A papal bull of Alexander IV in 1259 made the white cross the design to be put on the mantling of the knights. After that, the emblem was adopted as a general symbol for the Order. In the time after the Hospitallers moved to Cyprus in 1291, the banner of a white cross in a red field was flown from ships in their navy.

The property has been listed twice on the National Register of Historic Places, in 1975 and 1978. Description and history The Salem Cross Inn is located on in western West Brookfield, on the south side of West Main Street. The main building is a large connected New England farmstead, consisting of a handsome Georgian style main house, and a series of ells extending behind it to a barn. The main house is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, central chimney, clapboard siding, and stone foundation. The interior spaces retain original flooring and woodwork, and substantial portions of its original plasterwork. A short way west of the main building stands the original White Homestead, now converted to a carriage barn. The property was granted to John White, the grandson of the Mayflower-born Peregrine White. in 1707 for service to the town during recent conflicts with Native Americans. Soon thereafter he built the original homestead. In 1710 he was killed in a Native American attack, one of the last to occur in the area. The main house and barn were built in 1740 by his sons, John and Cornelius White. Prominent later residents of the house include the missionary sisters Sarah White Smith and Adeline White Tracy, who performer religious missionary work in the Oregon Country and in Singapore, respectively.

Asabani Nistam!) is a 2014 Iranian drama film written and directed by Reza Dormishian, starring Navid Mohamadzadeh and Baran Kosari. The film was screened in the Panorama section of the 64th Berlin International Film Festival. The film depicts the bitter story of Navid, an Iranian Kurd university student, who has become \\"starred\\" - a term used in Iran for the university students who have been expelled from university because of their political beliefs or activities, hence the insertion of an asterisk in front of their names. Navid tries hard not to lose his love Setareh [the Persian word for ‚Äòstar‚Äô] in I‚Äôm not angry! They met 4 years ago during the unrest in Tehran after the disputed election in 2009, and now Setareh's father asks Navid to clarify his relation with her. We accompany Navid in his efforts to provide the minimum requirements of living, and we take a glance at the various layers of the social classes in Iran. I‚Äôm not angry! is an independent product in the Iranian cinema. That is, the film has not received any financial help from any institute, organisation, centre, institution, state-run or non-governmental network or foundation. The shooting of I‚Äôm not angry! was done in more than 60 locations from the northernmost to the southernmost areas in Tehran. A 2013 production, I‚Äôm not angry!, was a controversial film in 32nd Fajr International Film Festival in 2014 and the only Iranian film in 64th Berlin International Film Festival in 2014. It is Reza Dormishian's second feature film after the feature Hatred. Shot completely in Tehran, I‚Äôm not angry! explicitly criticises today's conditions in Iran, and as it is written at the beginning of the film, it is ‚ÄòA Free Adaptation of Today Iran‚Äô. Berlin International Film Festival in its festival's website announced on 18 January that I‚Äôm not angry! would be screened in the 64th Berlinale, held 6‚Äì16 February 2014 in Germany, as the sole representative of the Iranian cinema. The film had an enthusiastic reception from the critics and audience, and after each screening, Reza Dormishian and the two leading actors Navid Mohammadzadeh and Baran Kosari attended the press conferences among lengthy applauses. Synopsis I‚Äôm not angry! is the story of Navid, a starred and expelled university student who - while trying to provide the least requirements of a normal life -, tries not to get angry when he is faced with the immoralities prevalent in the society, and does all he can not to lose his love, Setareh.

He also served there as the chair of the art department for a number of years. He was also the director of the local chapter of the Polish Professional Artists' Association () from 1989 to 1991. Polit's support for his community includes donating to a number of organizations through annual art auctions. Some of the more notable events are the Polish Contemporary Art Auctions coordinated through the Polish Consulate in New York City and his Indianapolis exhibits supporting public television. Others are donations to benefit the St. Albert Society in Rzesz√≥w, where he was awarded in 2002 with the Society's recognition award for exceptional generosity and his continuing support for Children's Hospice charities of Southeastern Poland. Polit also actively supports the Catholic Charities of the Rzesz√≥w region and other local charities.  Works  Polit initially focused on industrial art design in parallel with his lifelong pursuit of painting and drawing. Later, he transitioned to painting full-time. Among his works are the interior design of the of Roman Catholic Diocese of Rzesz√≥w. He designed the altar and also painted the large frescos that adorned the church's interior walls, including murals of Jesus and patron saints of the diocese, J√≥zef Sebastian Pelczar and Karolina K√≥zka. Also at the cathedral is Polit's rendition of the Stations of the Cross, a traditional series of images depicting Jesus on the day of his crucifixion. Polit's religious works can also be found in Rzesz√≥w, Matys√≥wka, Trzebownisko, Nowa Dƒôba, Sonina, Rog√≥≈ºno, and ≈Åukawiec. His secular works often draw inspiration from his personal life. He often paints self-portraits as well as portraits of his friends and family including his wife, sons and grandchildren. His portraits are depicted in intimate scenes and in a highly stylized form unique to the artist.  Awards  In 1996, Polit received the Rzesz√≥w Heritage Award for contributions to \\"shaping and developing the region's art environment\\". In 2003, he named as the National Art Educator for his contributions to art education in Poland.

He was Jessica Gallagher's guide skier at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, winning a bronze medal. He represented Australia at the 2008 World Junior Alpine Skiing Championships and the 2009 FIS Alpine World Ski Championships, but his career was cut short when he was severely injured in a traffic collision in 2009. He became Jessica Gallagher's sighted guide in 2013, and guided her to silver medals in women's slalom and giant slalom at the 2013 IPC Alpine Skiing World Cup in Thredbo. Geiger was Melissa Perrine's guide and coach at the 2018 Winter Paralympics where she won two bronze medals. Personal Geiger was born on 29 March 1988 in St Leonards, New South Wales, Australia, but lived in Austria until he was eight. On 26 September 2009, he was involved in a car crash. The vehicle he was travelling in as a passenger slammed into a tree just from his family's home in Bright, Victoria. He suffered severe injuries to his arm, spleen and liver as well as serious brain trauma. As a result, he was in an induced coma for a week. It took months before he could walk, talk and eat independently again. As of August 2011, he had ten operations, extensive physiotherapy and speech therapy. Skiing Geiger began skiing at the age of two in Austria, and made the national team in 2006. He won numerous Australian Championships during his teenage years, and represented Australia at the 2008 World Junior Alpine Skiing Championships and the 2009 FIS Alpine World Ski Championships. This changed after his 2009 accident. \\"I tried to get back to able bodied [competition] but couldn't quite get back to where I was, let alone where I wanted to go,\\" he later explained, \\"so I had to hang it up.\\" In 2013, Australian Paralympic Alpine Head Coach Steve Graham asked Geiger to replace Eric Bickerton as Jessica Gallagher's sighted guide. In their first competition, the 2013 IPC Alpine Skiing World Cup in Thredbo, New South Wales, he guided Gallagher to silver medals in women's slalom and giant slalom. Gallagher gave an insight on taking on Geiger as a guide. She said: Geiger was guide to Gallagher at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, where they won a bronze medal in the women's giant slalom visually impaired event. They came seventh in the women's slalom visually impaired. In 2015, he was Head Coach of Australia‚Äôs Para-Alpine Skiing program. Following Gallagher's move to para-cycling, Geiger became sighted guide to Melissa Perrine. At the 2018 Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang, Geiger guided Perrine to bronze medal wins in the women's super combined and giant slalom visually impaired events. The pair also placed fourth in the slalom and fifth in the downhill and super-G visually impaired. In November 2018, Geiger won the New South Wales Institute of Sport 7News Spirit of Sport Award, as voted by the public, for his act of generosity in flying Perrine‚Äôs family to PyeongChang, allowing them to watch her compete at the Winter Paralympics. At the 2019 Australian Ski and Snowboard Awards, Geiger with Ryan Pearl was named Coach of the Year (Paralympic disciplines).

The band emerged from the ashes of the new wave band Tecknospray (1978‚Äì81), where the founding members played side by side as guitarist/keyboardist and bassist/keyboardist. In the new line-up Mauro Tavella (synthesizer and programs) and Andrea Costa (synthesizer and vocals) immediately decided to dedicate themselves exclusively to electro - music. Their aim was to blend traditional pop melodies with the latest synthesized sounds.  Live  Live concerts were performed on a ‚Äúsynthesizers and percussion‚Äù recorded base coming from a 4-track tape player. This was normally supported by visual material (slides shows and 16mm film clips). The melodies, the main instrumental parts and vocals were always played live. The four most important tours were: Ice Age (40 dates in Piedmont and around Italy, from 1981 to 1982); Monuments from the Future (60 dates from 1983 to 1984, with 8 shows in Germany; Nite & Lite (50 dates spanning 1984 and 1985, with 10 shows in France and Belgium); Per mangiare le nuvole (about 40 dates from 1985 to 1986, including a show in which they represented new Italian music at the first Mediterranean Biennial in Barcelona (1985). In the same years they also did some impromptu sound performances. These included \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" in 1984 during which Monuments played a two-hour improvised sound track to accompany a sunset at 2,400 meters in the Alps. Monuments, Age Cover 1984  Theatre, Radio and Cinema  In 1986, Monuments decided to abandon the live set, but they held on to their synthesizers and music. In previous years they had often been commissioned to write music and now decided to return to their private studio to work on soundtracks for the theatre, radio and independent cinema.Junoplus Web Magazine In 1987, they pooled economic and physical resources by joining forces with Carlo Ubaldo Rossi and Andrea Lesmo to create a professional recording studios (Transeuropa Recording Studio). This new lineup mixed and produced a lot of independent music for artists such as Litfiba, Neon, Moda and others, as well as composing new material on commission. In 1995, Monuments start working on a new live experiment, Electron√¨a Alchemica, which would see them working exclusively with sound (bringing the mixer on stage, too) to produce a quadraphonic concert. The show was only performed in a few select venues and then dropped.  Crisis  In 2002, the duo agreed to have a break. Mauro Tavella devoted his time to working as technical director and occasional producer on projects for Africa Unite (Italian reggae band) and also worked as a freelance in many different recording studios in the city. Andrea Costa worked on a few experimental solo projects and also began providing technical and artistic support for fashion shows and conventions.  The recent history  In 2006, the story seemed all over when Costa and Tavella felt like giving it another go. They rekindled the Monument project by inviting the singer/composer Marino Paire to work with them. They had already collaborated with him over the years in parallel experiences. Marino Paire should have joined the lineup in 1986, but the change in direction of the duo placed the idea on the back burner. In 2007 Anna Logue Records contacted them to discuss reissuing some of the old material and some previously unheard tracks. This resulted in XXVII coming out at the beginning of 2008. This CD is an anthology containing the best of the group‚Äôs early years (1981‚Äì84). The first ever piece by the duo, Die Denkm√§ler (1981), was specially rearranged for the occasion in a more modern guise, and represents a crossover point towards their most recent work. Between 2008 and 2010 Monuments tested the new line-up in Turin with an improvised live performance (Electron√¨a Alchemica 2). They also reinterpreted some pieces by Mozart for a live performance by Italian artist Maurizio Vetrugno. They produced an multimedia installation called Up/Down for a contemporary art exhibition. At the same time, a number of compilations came out on the market containing tracks by Monuments. In 2012 Marino Paire leaves the band and Andrea Costa and Mauro Tavella continue to work together. A new album will be released in a short time. Monuments live at the Nietzsche Fabrik, Turin, 2008  Discography  ; Albums * Body section (vinyl) A.A.V.V.

It sits no more than 50 meters from the walls of Nakagusuku Castle.  Background  It is believed to have been built by a wealthy businessman from Naha in order to take advantage of the 1975 Okinawa Ocean Exposition. The hill directly South of Nakagusuku Castle was chosen as the construction site because of the view of both the Pacific Ocean and the East China Sea. There were warnings given by monks from a nearby Buddhist temple that the site was home to numerous graves and sacred sites, but they were initially ignored. After many construction accidents, the workers refused to finish the complex. It now sits empty and overgrown by vegetation.Allen, David. \\"Marine Corps dubs Okinawa's Royal Hotel ruins off- limits.\\" Stars and Stripes [Okinawa] 01 Jul 2009, n. pag. Web. 11 Feb. 2014. .

It serves as a popular tourist attraction in Quechee State Park and can be viewed from the U.S. Route 4 bridge and from trails on both sides of the gorge. Many people from around New England flock to the gorge for the views. The Ottauquechee River flows through the bottom of the gorge and is a popular whitewater kayak run.

The carving is thought to be a result of rapid downcutting of the Ottauquechee River after the drainage of glacial Lake Hitchcock. The gorge cuts through bedrock of the Devonian Gile Mountain Formation and Mesozoic mafic dikes can be seen on the west wall.McHone, Gregory, 1981, The origin of the Quechee Gorge: Green Mountain Geologist, Vt Geological Society, Fall 1981, Vol. 8, #3.

The statue has been carbon dated to around 2250 BC, during the late Neolithic period or early Bronze Age, making it one of the oldest human representations found in Europe. The statue is made of Scots pine and stands high. It has two legs but no arms; hips and buttocks narrowing to a waist and then broadening to shoulders; and a rounded head. There are straight markings cut across both legs. A hole in the pubic region can be interpreted as indicating a female, but with the insertion of a phallic peg (now lost) would indicate a male. There appears to be damage to the left eye, recalling Odin's sacrifice of an eye at M√≠mir's Well in return for wisdom in Norse myth. The statue was found in marshland on the north bank of the River Thames to the east of London, south of Ripple Road in Dagenham, during excavation for sewer pipes in 1922, now on the site of Ford Dagenham. It was buried in a layer of peat about below ground level, near the skeleton of a deer. The statue may have been buried with the deer as a votive fertility sacrifice. The original statue is owned by Colchester Castle Museum, with a copy in the Museum of London. The original went on indefinite loan to Valence House Museum in Dagenham in 2010.

Life  Through the Forest, c.1911 Beginning in 1867, Z√ºgel was a student at the art school in Stuttgart under Bernhard von Neher and Heinrich von Rustige, where he studied animal and genre painting. Two years later, he transferred to the Academy of Fine Arts Munich, but was not inspired by the teaching methods of Karl von Piloty and decided to work independently.Ketterer Kunst: Biography Afterwards, he spent some time in Vienna and finally settled in Munich. Anton Braith became an important mentor for him there. In the early 1880s, he was attracted to the rural scenery in the Dachau District and began to paint outdoors, placing his subjects in a broader landscape setting. Studies undertaken along the Dutch and Belgian coastline in the early 1890s confirmed his attraction to Impressionism, which he had encountered at exhibitions in Paris. From that point on, atmospheric reflections and the play of light and shadow were his primary concerns, while details were subordinated. This led him to become one of the founding members of the Munich Secession. He spent over forty years on a theme he called \\"Heavy Work\\" (mostly portrayals of horses and oxen plowing) and produced over 24 canvases, which give a detailed picture of his artistic development. He continued to paint in a light, impressionistic style until he was in his eighties. In 1895, he became a Professor at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich, a position he retained until his retirement in 1922. Christian Schad, Maximilian Liebenwein and Wilhelm Stumpf were among his best-known students. One of his last 'Meistersch√ºler\\" was Heinz Theis (1894-1966). In W√∂rth am Rhein, there is a Memorial Gallery dedicated to his works at the Old City Hall. He spent many summers there, on vacation or with his students. The city benefitted greatly from the modelling fees and the rentals he paid to use their animals, as well as the money his students spent on food and lodging. His works are also on display at the National Gallery (Berlin).

Its technology employed deep learning for various applications in natural language processing, such as semantic text analysis and sentiment analysis, as well as computer vision. AlchemyAPI offered both traditionally-licensed software products as well API access under a Software as a service model. After acquisition by IBM in 2015, the products were integrated into the Watson line of products and the brand name eventually disappeared. Technology and business model As the name suggests, the business model of charging for access to an API was central to the company's identity and uncommon for its time: A TechCrunch article highlighted that even though the technology was similar to IBM's Watson, the pay-per-use model made it more accessible, especially to non-enterprise customers. At one point, AlchemyAPI served over 3 billion API calls per month. History AlchemyAPI launched in 2009. In September 2011, ProgrammableWeb added AlchemyAPI to its API Billionaires Club, alongside giants such as Google and Facebook. In February 2013, it was announced that AlchemyAPI had raised US$2 million to improve the capabilities of its deep learning technology. In September 2013, it was reported that AlchemyAPI had created a Google Glass app that could identify what a person was looking at, and that AlchemyAPI would soon be rolling out deep learning- based image recognition as a service. As of February 2014 (prior to the IBM acquisition), it claimed to have clients in 36 countries and process over 3 billion documents a month. In May 2014, it was reported that AlchemyAPI had released a computer vision API known as AlchemyVision, capable of recognizing objects in photographs and providing image similarity search capabilities. In March 2015, it was announced that AlchemyAPI had been acquired by IBM and the company's breakthroughs in deep learning would accelerate IBM's development of next generation cognitive computing applications. IBM reported plans to integrate AlchemyAPI's deep learning technology into the core Watson platform Media coverage A February 2013 article in VentureBeat about big data named AlchemyAPI as one of the primary forces responsible for bringing natural language processing capabilities to the masses. In November 2013, GigaOm listed AlchemyAPI as one of the top startups working in deep learning, along with Cortica and Ersatz.

Plot  The main character is career-obsessed Bo Dan Wu (played by Johnny Lu), a rising star at a telecom company in Taipei. When he learns the news of his estranged mother's death, he reluctantly returns to his hometown (set in Matsu's picturesque Qinbi Village (ËäπÂ£ÅÊùë) to pay his respects. When he arrives, he learns of a tradition which requires him to either marry within 100 days or wait for three years. There is just one catch: Bo Dan does not plan on getting married any time soon. Fortunately, his step-brother Zhen Fong (played by Soda Voyu), decides to marry his long-time fianc√© Xiao Wei (played by Tracy Chou) in three days. It turns out that Xiao Wei is actually Bo Dan's childhood sweetheart, and when a typhoon prevents him from leaving the island, the two are forced with the possibility of rekindling their romance. Xiao Wei is forced to choose: her doting fianc√© who is the ‚Äúright‚Äù choice, or the man of her dreams.  Cast  * Johnny Lu as Bo Dan Wu * Akira Chen (Èô≥ÊñáÂΩ¨) as Mo Shu * Tracy Chou (Âë®ÈááË©©) as Xiao Wei * Julianne Chu (Êú±ËïæÂÆâ) * Tsai Ming-hsiu (Ëî°Êòé‰øÆ) as Liu Ching * Soda Voyu (ËòáÈÅî) as Zhen Fong  Production  Principal photography of the island scenes in the film were shot in Taiwan's Matsu Islands. Director Chan said he shot the film in Qinbi (ËäπÂ£ÅÊùë) Village on Matsu's Beigan Township (ÂåóÁ´ø) island because the village looked like ‚Äúit hasn‚Äôt been touched by time.‚Äù ‚ÄúI wanted the village to be a character. If I came back to discover my own village and fell in love with it, it had to be attractive and beautiful,‚Äù Chan says. But Matsu was an expensive choice. Lacking the infrastructure necessary for filmmaking, the crew had to ship everything to the island, including 14 trucks, cranes, generators and extras. And similar to the protagonist in the movie, a typhoon stranded the production team on the island a few times. Additional scenes were shot in Taipei, Taiwan.  Release  The film premiered at the 33rd Hawaii International Film Festival on October 13, 2013 with English subtitles. Following this, the film saw a nationwide release in Taiwan on November 1, 2013.

Merry-Go-Round is a large oil on canvas painting made by Mark Gertler in 1916, when he was 24 years old. It is perhaps his most famous work, and depicts men and women (many in uniform) on a merry-go-round ride. The painting (and another 1915 painting entitled Swing Boats, now lost) may have been inspired by a ride at the annual fair on Hampstead Heath. The painting is now held in Tate Britain. Background Gertler moved to Hampstead in north London in late 1914. A letter written by Gertler's friend D. H. Lawrence in September 1915 mentions wounded soldiers in uniforms enjoying the rowdy entertainment at the fair. Another letter by Lawrence in 1916 describes the painting as \\"the best modern picture I have seen: I think it is great and true\\". The work in progress is mentioned in a letter sent by Gertler to Lytton Strachey in May 1916: \\"I am working very hard on a large and very unsaleable picture of Merry-Go-Round.\\" Painting The painting measures . It depicts sixteen figures travelling on horseback around a fairground carousel, arranged in five groups of three plus a singleton. The figures resemble dolls, becoming abstracted into blocks of bright colours, with open mouths as if they are screaming. Some are in military uniforms and others in civilian clothes. The work takes inspiration from the Vorticist and Futurist works of David Bomberg and Christopher Nevinson. Reception The painting was included in the London Group exhibition at the Mansard Gallery in 1917. It was interpreted as a deliberately \\"modern\\" and decorative work at the time, but is now seen as Gertler's visceral reaction to ‚Äì and protest against ‚Äì the First World War, perhaps triggered by the possibility that Gertler could be conscripted into the British Army. Gertler was a conscientious objector. Expanding on the theme of war, the painting may represent the threefold colours of wholeness and balance in our Thinking, Feeling and Willing ‚Äì within a human being. The four sets of people too suggest the balance between the masculine and feminine aspects within us; whilst the individual sailor is presented as the true unknown, unseen and rather elusive higher self. The continuous merry-go-round search for balance through the battle of suffering ‚Äì as a strangely joyful part of the human Life. Gertler was working on a sculpture version of Merry- Go-Round in 1916. The painting remained unsold during Gertler's lifetime. After his suicide in 1939 it was acquired by Leicester Galleries, who gave it to the Ben Uri Art Society in 1945. The Tate Gallery bought it from the Ben Uri Art Society in 1984. Roundel by Keith Bowler in Elder Street, Spitalfields, inspired by Merry-Go-Round A cast-iron roundel (or mock coal hole cover) depicting a detail from Merry-Go-Round is set into the pavement in front of Gertler's former home and studio at 32 Elder Street, Spitalfields, London. It was installed in 1995, and is one of a series of such roundels created by sculptor Keith Bowler to celebrate Spitalfields heritage.

He was educated at Brown University and Princeton University. After short stints teaching at Brown and Princeton, serving in the Chemical Warfare Service during World War I, and researching at the Carnegie Institution for Science, Buddington settled at Princeton, where he taught for nearly 40 years. He chaired the Department of Geology from 1936 to 1950. He also had a long career with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), doing field work for that agency in Alaska, Oregon, and the northeastern United States. Buddington was elected to the American Philosophical Society, the National Academy of Sciences, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His years of work for the USGS earned him the Distinguished Service award of the U.S. Department of the Interior. Early life and education Buddington was born November 29, 1890, in Wilmington, Delaware, to Mary Salina Buddington (n√©e Wheeler) and Osmer G. Buddington. His parents' families had been in Connecticut since the 1600s, and he was descended from men who fought for the United States in the American Revolution. His father was a Baptist minister who supplemented his income by farming crops and raising chickens. In 1895 his mother died; his father later married Ella Turner. In 1904 the family relocated to West Mystic, Connecticut, where the father became the minister at a church in nearby Poquonock Bridge, Connecticut.Brown University. The Catalogue of Brown University, 1912‚Äì1913, p. 196. Arthur Buddington was educated in public schools of Wilmington, Mystic, and Westerly, Rhode Island. In 1908 he graduated from Westerly High School. He then matriculated at Brown University. After an unpleasant year in the liberal arts program, he switched to the sciences. He graduated second in his class in 1912 with a bachelor's degree in geology, chemistry, and physics. He was also elected to Sigma Xi in 1912.Brown Catalogue, p. 251. After graduating Buddington remained at Brown to earn a master of science degree in 1913, writing a master's thesis on fossiliferous Carboniferous shales that had recently been discovered on College Hill, on which Brown is situated.Brown University.

He was first a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton, but in 1917 he took a position teaching at Brown. In early 1918, with World War I raging, he returned to Princeton to teach military aerial observation in its aviation ground school. Specifically he taught map-reading, range-finding, and telegraphy.Oscar M. Voorhees, ed. The Phi Beta Kappa Key, Oct. 1918, p. 396. In April he enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army's Signal Corps. He trained briefly as an aerial observer and photo interpreter before being reassigned to the Chemical Warfare Service, where he did research under Richard C. Tolman. He was discharged at war's end in 1919 as a sergeant first classBrown University War Records Committee. Brown University in the War, 1919, p. 52. and then returned to Brown once again to teach. Later that year he joined the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C. In 1920 Buddington was appointed assistant professor at Princeton, where he remained until retiring in 1959. He put a great emphasis on teaching. Each year he gave a senior-level undergraduate course in petrology and one graduate course in petrology or chemical geology. As chair of the Department of Geology from 1936 to 1950, he built Princeton's reputation in petrology and studies of ore in addition to its traditional strength in paleontology. Harry Hammond Hess and John Tuzo Wilson were among his students.Harold L. James. Buddington, Arthur Francis. Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography, 2008. Accessed Feb. 13, 2014. Buddington also had a long association with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). He spent the summers from 1921 to 1925 producing geologic maps of southeastern Alaska. The summer of 1930 was devoted to mapping Oregon portions of the Cascade Range. In 1943 the USGS appointed him head of what would become a 17-year field project on the iron ores of the northeastern United States. This large collaboration produced some important scientific results and identified several economically compelling ore deposits.

The signatories were Jules Favre, foreign minister in the provisional Government of National Defence, for the French and Otto von Bismarck, chancellor of the newly established German Empire, for Prussia and her allies. The suspension of hostilities initially lasted until 19 February, when it was extended through 26 February, when a preliminary peace treaty was signed, also at Versailles. The definitive Treaty of Frankfurt was signed on 10 May. Although technically an armistice, the military position of France at the time and the terms were such that it was de facto a conditional surrender by the vanquished to the victors. First attempt On the morning of 2 September, with the battle of Sedan raging about him, Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, ordered a white flag hoisted above the fortress of Sedan. The emperor then order the commander of the XII Corps, General Barth√©l√©my Lebrun, to send a negotiator (parlementaire) to the Prussians with a request for an armistice. The chief of staff of the Army of Ch√¢lons refused to sign any such agreement on behalf of the nominal, but wounded commander, Patrice de Mac-Mahon, and General Auguste- Alexandre Ducrot disclaimed any authority to do so because he had already been countermanded once by his superior, General Emmanuel de Wimpffen. Nevertheless, Lebrun and a non-commissioned officer with a white pennant crossed the lines to seek an armistice \\"equally acceptable to both armies\\", bearing a formal letter to that effect. Wimpffen, who would have signed the local armistice, only learned of the effort when he saw the white flag moving along the road. He refused to allow it. When the Prussian commander, Helmuth von Moltke, saw the white flag, he sent Fritz Bronsart von Schellendorf to find out what it meant. Napoleon sent him back with one of his own officers, General A.-C.-V. Reille, who carried a letter offering to surrender. After reading it, von Moltke sent Reille back with a letter of acceptance. Wimpffen was ordered to arrange the surrender. This day, Sedantag in German (French journ√©e de Sedan), became a holiday in the German Empire. The first, brief attempt to avoid disaster through an armistice had failed and the emperor had become a prisoner of war. First negotiations Favre, a staunch republican, was appointed vice president and minister of foreign affairs in the provisional government declared on 4 September 1870, after the capture of the Emperor Napoleon III. Like President Louis Jules Trochu, Favre did not believe France held a realistic chance of winning the war or even of defending Paris. Soon after the formation of the new government, Favre proposed to the cabinet that Germany be offered an indemnity in return for evacuating French territory. This was rejected, and Favre opened a channel of communications with Bismarck through the British ambassador in Paris, Lord Lyons. Bismarck questioned the legitimacy of the French government. On 17 September, Favre left Paris for the Prussian military headquarters to confer with Bismarck about an armistice. Only President Trochu and Minister of War Adolphe LeFl√¥ of all the members of the government had knowledge of his plan. Favre crossed the German lines with a flag of truce and met Bismarck at Montry. From there they proceeded to the headquarters at Ch√¢teau de Ferri√®res, where two full days were exhausted in discussion, but no armistice was arranged before Favre returned to Paris on 19 September. Favre offered an indemnity of 500,000,000 francs, but refused Bismarck's request for territorial concessions. Favre's early public pronouncement that \\"We will not surrender an inch of our territory, nor a stone of our fortresses!\\" had become a slogan in Paris and was posted all over the city in September‚ÄìOctober 1870. Favre argued that an armistice would allow the French to hold elections to an assembly that would have political legitimacy. Bismarck agreed, but refused to sign an armistice for such elections unless certain Parisian forts were surrendered in compensation for the advantage France would gain in time. Finally, Favre offered to surrender Strasbourg if its defenders received the honours of war. Bismarck demanded they become prisoners of war and discussion broke off. Before leaving Bismarck, Favre wept. On 20 September Favre reported his results to the cabinet, and Bismarck's terms were rejected completely. On 24 September the government indefinitely postponed local and national elections. In the words of L√©on Gambetta, \\"We could not have elections without an armistice, and the effect of an armistice would be to relax the efforts of the defence.\\" On 1 October two neutral American officers, General Ambrose Burnside and Colonel Paul Forbes, were granted permission by the Germans to visit Paris as observers. When they returned they reported to the Germans the French conditions for an armistice: that it last two weeks, that elections be held, that Paris be revictualled and that no territory be ceded‚Äîalthough Favre had apparently come to accept the loss of Alsace. The American effort had no effect but to clarify to each side what was unacceptable to the other: the revictualling of Paris to the Germans and territorial concessions to the French. Second negotiations German headquarters at Versailles during the Franco-Prussian War After the failure of the first effort at an armistice, the Government of National Defence sent Louis Adolphe Thiers on a diplomatic mission to the capitals of neutral Europe. At London Lord Granville offered to help negotiate an armistice, which offer was never taken up. When Thiers was granted a safe conduct through the German siege lines around Paris, he briefly met Bismarck, only to tell him that he was unauthorised to speak to the enemy. Bismarck told him that Metz had surrendered. When Thiers reported the results of his mission to the cabinet that evening, they agreed that an armistice was needed. Thiers volunteered to negotiate it, and was duly deputised. He was given two conditions that any armistice should meet: it should allow for free elections (including in France's occupied territories) to be held and it should allow the provisioning of Paris. On the morning of 31 October, the Journal officiel carried the first public notice that an armistice may be sought. Thiers arrived at Versailles on 31 October and negotiations began the next day (1 November). Thiers initially asked for a 28-day armistice with provisioning of Paris and all besieged cities. Bismarck refused and countered by asking for one of the Parisian forts to balance the military advantages France would accrue from a ceasefire. Thiers rejected the surrender of any fortress. He later claimed that Bismarck had been amenable to French demands until news of the popular uprising in Paris had reached him. This uprising‚Äîaccompanied by shouts of Pas d'armistice! (No armistice!)‚Äîhad been a response to rumours of Thiers's negotiations. According to Thiers it caused Bismarck to increase his demands, but Lord Lyons believed that the chancellor was merely looking for an excuse to break off talks. Having failed to reach an agreement on armistice terms, Thiers tried to uncover the Germans' intentions for the peace treaty. Bismarck threatened that the terms for peace would get harsher the longer the war lasted. As of 5 November, he was demanding Alsace with Strasbourg, part of Lorraine not including Metz and an indemnity of 4,000,000,000 francs. On that date, on the Pont de S√®vres, between the German and French lines, Thiers met Favre and counselled acceptance of Bismarck's terms. He offered to take \\"the responsibility and odium of signing a treaty\\", according to a letter of Lord Lyons, but Favre would not agree. On 6 November Thiers was back at Versailles when Favre ordered him to break off negotiations and go to Tours. He was escorted to the French lines by German soldiers and from there took a train to Tours. He arrived sitting atop a heap of coal. Third negotiations There was no effort to end the war by diplomatic means between 6 November 1870 and 23 January 1871. During that period Favre and Ernest Picard were the only voices in the government advocating a capitulation or a sortie torrentielle, a major military undertaking. By 27 December, when howitzers had begun to strike the Parisian fortresses, the city was facing famine and loss of morale. On 5 January the residential areas of the city fell under bombardment. The last gasp of French military resistance came at the battle of Buzenval on 19 January. They were defeated. On 20 January Trochu asked for a local armistice to bury the dead, but Bismarck refused. The French president resigned, and on 22 January when a council of war proposed a second mass sortie, there was no officer willing to lead it. On 23 January, Favre was empowered by the cabinet to seek a general armistice, as opposed to the armistice limited to Paris that Trochu favoured. Such a local ceasefire, Favre argued, would only give the Germans the freedom to concentrate their military power on the provincial armies. Favre was not empowered to negotiate a treaty, since that was supposed to only follow elections to a national assembly. He was to permit the disarming of regular soldiers, but not of the National Guard, whose disarming was either feared lest it result in a popular uprising or promoted lest the Guard initiate an uprising. He was not to concede the Germans entry into Paris. He arrived at Versailles under a safe conduct later that evening. Favre admitted to the Germans that Paris was starving, and at Bismarck's request he wrote down an outline of an armistice, including in it the cession of one of the Parisian forts, which would effectively end the siege of Paris in Germany's favour. Bismarck agreed not to enter Paris and to allow the defenders to remain in the city; he would permit a free election and allow the Guard and one regular division to remain armed. The disarming of the rest made it impossible later on for the government to suppress the Paris Commune, whose uprising was possible because the Guard retained its arms. On 24 January Bismarck agreed to abandon his other negotiations‚Äîwith the exiled Empress Eug√©nie and her representative, Cl√©ment Duvernois‚Äîand on 25 January the government authorised Favre to sign an armistice for three weeks. On 26 January Bismarck graciously offered to cease the bombardment of Paris and Favre accepted. A general Parisian ceasefire was agreed for midnight (27 January) and commanders on both sides were given advanced notice. \\"A few stray shots were fired after the deadline\\", the armistice was de facto in effect from that moment. The oral accord in effect from this time mandated that: *Hostilities were to cease on land and at sea. *The Parisian forts were to be surrendered. *An elected assembly was to vote on whether to end the war or continue it before the expiration of the armistice. *An indemnity of 200,000,000 francs was levied on France. These terms were to be in effect until 19 February. Owing to a lack of information about operations in the departments of Jura, Doubs and C√¥te-d'Or, these areas were exempted from the general armistice terms in order to preserve the fortified region of Belfort, then under siege. The primary source for the extent of the agreement reached on the date of the ceasefire is the diary of the future German emperor Frederick III, based on his contacts with Bismarck. Fourth and final negotiations The Government of National Defence In Paris Favre requested an officer to help him negotiate the technical articles of the formal armistice. He and General Charles de Beaufort d'Hautpoul returned to Versailles on 27 January, but, according to German accounts, the latter got drunk at the dinner celebration and Favre had to get a postponement of the final negotiations to the next day (28 January). On this second try a more competent officer, Charles Horix de Valdan, chief of staff to the commander of Paris, Joseph Vinoy, was sent along. Lacking sources of information on the disposition of his own troops at the time, Valdan relied on that supplied by von Moltke in demarcating the lines of control of the two sides. Both sides were to withdraw ten miles from the lines of control and the area between the German siege works and the disarmed Parisian forts was to be neutral. When Valdan had completed the technical military matters, Favre and Bismarck signed the final document on 28 January 1871. It immediately came into effect in Paris, and on 31 January in the other pertinent areas. The Army of the East under General Justin Clinchant, still operating in Jura, Doubs and C√¥te-d'Or, was not informed that the armistice did not apply to its area. Favre had neglected to inform the government in Bordeaux. It mistakenly halted and was surrounded by the better-informed German troops of the Army of the South under General Edwin von Manteuffel. On 31 January, having already negotiated safe passage for wounded soldiers into Switzerland and having received from his government confirmation that no armistice for his zone would be forthcoming, Clinchant signed a convention with the Swiss at the border post of Les Verri√®res, allowing his army to retreat across the frontier. On 1 February the whole road from Pontarlier to the border was filled with retreating troops, and the last skirmish of the war was fought at La Cluse by men of the reserve, who held off the Germans before joining their comrades in Switzerland. On 2 February news reached Versailles that on 27 January the Delegation of the Government of National Defence at Bordeaux had publicly proclaimed that \\"[w]e cannot believe that negotiations of this kind could have been undertaken without the Delegation being previously notified.\\" The late arrival of this news had no effect on the armistice, and in the interim the Delegation had obeyed the order from Versailles to publish the armistice, inform the provincial armies and begin preparations for a general election. Nonetheless, when Jules Simon, representing the government, met the Delegation in Bordeaux on 31 January, he ordered removed the placards that read: > Let us make use of the Armistice as a school for instruction for our young > troops. . . In place of the reactionary and cowardly Assembly of which the > enemy dreams, let us install an Assembly that is truly national and > republican, desiring peace, if peace assures our honour ... but capable of > willing war also, ready for anything rather than lend a hand in the murder > of France. On 6 February the leader of the Delegation, Gambetta, resigned. On 8 February the promised elections to the National Assembly took place. The body met in Bordeaux on 12 February. It had a monarchist majority and a mandate for peace. On 15 February the fort of Belfort under Colonel Pierre Philippe Denfert- Rochereau was finally incorporated into the armistice. Its defenders marched out with the honours of war on 18 February. On 19 February the members of the National Assembly swore the \\"Pact of Bordeaux\\", a truce between the parties until the Third Republic was established. The armistice remained in effect even after the preliminary treaty of 26 February. Either was permitted to denounce it any day after 3 March, and to renew the fighting three days after that. On 1 March the Germans began their occupation of Paris. On 3 March they began to pull their troops out, yet riots erupted in Paris as the German troops marched out.

Recruited from the southeastern counties of Butler, Dale, Coffee, Covington, Russell and Montgomery, it saw extensive service with the Confederate Army of Tennessee before being nearly annihilated at the Battle of Franklin in 1864. Survivors from the regiment would continue to serve until the final capitulation of General Joseph Johnston in North Carolina in 1865. In addition to the counties named above, the 33rd Alabama drew recruits from three modern Alabama counties that did not yet exist in 1862: Geneva County, which was then a part of Dale and Coffee counties; Crenshaw County, which would be formed from Covington and other nearby counties after the war; and Houston County, which then formed a part of Dale and Henry Counties. Initially assigned to the defense of Confederate forts in Pensacola Bay, Florida, the 33rd was quickly transferred to duty in the Army of Tennessee, where it saw its first significant action at the Battle of Perryville. It went on to fight at Stone's River, Chickamauga, the Siege of Chattanooga, the Atlanta Campaign (including Ringgold Gap and Kennesaw Mountain), and the disastrous Franklin-Nashville Campaign in late 1864. From just after the Battle of Perryville through the Battle of Franklin, the 33rd fought under the \\"Stonewall of the West\\": Major General Patrick Cleburne, an Irish-born officer whom General Robert E. Lee once referred to as \\"a meteor shining from a clouded sky\\" for his battlefield prowess.Rand, Clayton. Sons of the South. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1961. . Page 138. Though it took horrific losses at Perryville (where it suffered eighty- two percent casualties) and at Franklin (where it lost two-thirds of its numbers), it held together with reduced numbers until the final Carolina Campaign in 1865. Historians of the 33rd benefit from extremely detailed accounts of this regiment's service by soldiers who served in it; the most important of these was written by Private W.E. Matthews of Co. B, who left records of nearly every aspect of regimental life from food to clothing to nicknames, sundries and even the soldiers' opinions of two different service rifles they were issued. Recruitment and early deployments=Initial organization, officers and strength The 33rd Alabama Infantry Regiment was organized in April 1862, in Pensacola, Florida.A total of 2,399 names are recorded on the National Park Service's alphabetical roster of soldiers who served with the 33rd Alabama Infantry between 1862 and 1865.

McRee Columbiad guns of the Confederate water battery at Warrington, Florida, near Fort McRee in Pensacola Bay The 33rd Alabama was initially assigned to duty during March‚ÄìApril 1862 at Fort McRee, which sat at the entrance to Pensacola Bay, Florida, opposite the Federal-held Fort Pickens.33rd Alabama Co. B, section entitled \\"A False Alarm.\\" By the time the 33rd arrived, Ft. McRee had been reduced to near-rubble by Federal warships and the guns of Ft. Pickens.Coleman, James C. (1988). Fort McRee, The Castle Built on Sand. Pensacola Historical Society. However, the local commander, General Braxton Bragg, insisted on holding it, anyway. According to one veteran's memoirs, their time at this location was spent in initial military training, drill, and guard duty. At one point, local commanders decided to remove the coastal artillery from the badly damaged fortress, and the 33rd was asked to help. The guns were removed from their five- to eight-inch bases during daylight hours; later, at night, they were slung beneath a specially built wagon equipped with fourteen-inch-wide tires, to which thirty-six mules were hitched.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 6. A lengthy rope was tied to the tongue, and 100 soldiers were tasked with pulling on it to help these mules haul the cannon across the sandy beach to barges on the bay, which in turn carried them on to Pensacola. The guns were replaced with wood planks shaped and painted to resemble artillery, to deceive the Federals into thinking the fort--or what was left of it at this point--was still a threat. While on duty at Ft. McRee, the regiment had its first direct encounter with the enemy--or what it thought was the enemy, at the time. During a fierce rainstorm one night, a Federal ship endeavoring to resupply Ft. Pickens encountered difficulties and jettisoned some of its cargo (described as \\"many barrels of vinegar, boxes of crackers and other things\\"); sentinels from Co's B and I mistook these floating crates for an amphibious assault force approaching their position, and fired on them before realizing their error. Private Matthews reported engaging a \\"whaleboat full of Yankees\\" trying to salvage some of these supplies; apparently, little damage was done by either side.33rd Alabama Co. B, section entitled \\"A False Alarm.\\" In this history, Matthews is credited as \\"W.E. Preston,\\" which is what he changed his name to, after the war. See Note A. Moving to Corinth Following their initial duty at Pensacola, the 33rd was ordered to report to Corinth, Mississippi, for duty with General Albert Sidney Johnston's Army of Mississippi. Arriving just after the Confederate loss at Shiloh (in which Johnston was killed and replaced in command by General P.G.T. Beauregard), the 33rd was assigned to the brigade commanded by Colonel Alexander T. Hawthorn, which was part of the Army's 3rd Corps.History of the 33rd Alabama In July 1862 Hawthorn's brigade became part of a division commanded by Major General William Hardee, and the following month the 33rd was transferred to a brigade (still in Hardee's division) commanded by Brigadier General Sterling Wood. Private Matthews reported being \\"strung out in muddy ditches in S.A.M. Wood's brigade,\\" in May 1862, and also indicates that he and his comrades traded in their Pensacola muskets for \\"new painted Enfield Rifles out of the boxes, with Minie balls cartridges, new bayonets and scabbards.\\" He reports that several soldiers were ill, and says that \\"we did not like the water [in Corinth], except that we carried from a flowing artesian well.\\" This same veteran later provided an anecdote from the regiment's time in Corinth: During this time, the men of the 33rd discarded many items that they now considered non- essential, burdened down as they were on their frequent marches: \\"hammers, pillows, towels, books, bedclothing, clothing, big knives, tinware, sheepskins, bear skins and other paraphernalia.\\" The Kentucky Campaign Confederate and Federal movements during the Kentucky Campaign Moving south --then north When General Hardee was given command of the \\"Left Wing\\" of the Army of Mississippi (now commanded by General Bragg, from the 33rd's Pensacola days), Wood's Fourth Brigade was assigned to the Third Division of the Left Wing, under command of Major General Simon Bolivar Buckner.Holman, Kurt. Perryville Order of Battle: Forces Present at Perryville, October 8, 1862 (Revised July 1, 2012) unpublished paper, Perryville Battlefield State Historic Site. In concert with the rest of the army, the 33rd left Corinth at the end of July and travelled by train from Tupelo, Mississippi, to Meridian; thence to Mobile, Alabama, and Montgomery, then on to Atlanta, Georgia, and Dalton before arriving at Tyner's Station, just east of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Following this, Wood's brigade marched into the city, where they crossed the Tennessee River on \\"a ferry boat, propelled by two blind horses\\" while picking up two months' pay (at $11 per month), a $50 bounty for each soldier, new shoes and clothing, and rations. Battle of Munfordville The Battle of Munfordville Up to now, the 33rd had not seen any significant action, but this was about to change. Emboldened by recent successes achieved by Confederate raiders under Colonel John Hunt Morgan and seeking to divert Federal attention from the strategically important towns of Chattanooga and Vicksburg, Mississippi, General Bragg decided to invade Kentucky, a slave state that had remained loyal to the Union--but which still contained a large pro-Confederate minority. Pursuing Federal troops rounded up many stragglers, but refrained from attacking the main Confederate force at first. Bragg's army reached the fortified town of Munfordville, on the Green River, on September 14. Despite the huge advantage in numbers possessed by the Southerners, the Federal commander, Colonel John T. Wilder, refused the initial demand for surrender. Confederate forces attacked his works and were repulsed, settling in for a two-day siege before the Federal commander was finally persuaded to give up after being taken on a personal tour of the Confederate siege lines by General Buckner.Cozzens, Peter. This Terrible Sound: The Battle of Chickamauga. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1992. ., pp. 14‚Äì15. The 33rd Alabama apparently did not take part in the earlier assault; Matthews simply reports that they lay in the woods under shell fire, expecting to be ordered to charge the fort, only to learn the next morning that the fort had capitulated. Matthews, pg. 10. Battle of Perryville Wood's Brigade at Perryville (see pink arrow) Following a Confederate victory at Richmond, Kentucky on August 30, Confederate forces advanced deeper into that state, seeking to drive the Federals across the Ohio River and thus establish the Confederacy's northern boundary on that waterway. A drought that summer had impacted both armies, with one soldier of the 33rd Alabama saying that: \\"we obtained water under deep limesinks, some of these being partly full of water, and Federals had utilized some of the partly filled sinks as a place to butcher cattle and dumped offal into them, making the water unfit to drink.\\"The Drought That Changed the War Another soldier, from the 9th Tennessee, reported that the only water available was usually from ponds, and this was \\"so muddy that we could not wash our faces in it.\\" Food supplies were also impacted by the dry weather, with Federal forces reduced first to half- rations, then to quarter-rations, then to hardtack and finally to \\"wormy flour\\". The Southerners fared little better. Perryville Slaughter Pen, drawn by an eyewitness. The \\"Slaughter Pen\\" is where the 33rd Alabama and its sister units fought at Perryville. Desperate for water, both armies converged on the tiny village of Perryville, Kentucky, where water was said to still be available. The Confederates reached the town first, with the 33rd Alabama arriving around 10:00 am on the morning of October 7 and deploying with the rest of Wood's brigade to the north of town. A battle commenced on the morning of October 8, with the 33rd taking little part until late afternoon, when Bragg called for fresh troops to launch an attack on Dixville Crossroads, held by the 34th Federal Brigade under Colonel George Webster. Webster's brigade contained the 22nd Indiana, 75th Illinois and 59th Illinois Infantry regiments, all of whom were raw recruits who had never seen combat before.Perryville Locations: The Fight For Webster's Hill In addition to these units, the 19th Indiana Artillery under Captain Samuel Harris assisted Webster in defending this area, which later became known as the \\"Perryville Slaughter Pen.\\"Perryville: The Slaughter Pen Wood's brigade, including the 33rd Alabama, attacked around 5pm and ran into murderous fire from Webster's men. The Federals, supported by Captain Harris' battery, decimated the attacking Confederates and forced them to withdraw. Regrouping at the base of the hill, the 33rd and its sister regiments--now assisting a fresh brigade led by Brigadier General St. John Richardson Liddell--charged again, taking more casualties but ultimately driving the Federals from the hill after Harris' battery ran out of ammunition and was forced to withdraw. The 22nd Indiana, directly opposite the 33rd Alabama, suffered 65% casualties--the most of any Federal unit on the battlefield.Civil War Trust: 10 Facts About Perryville . This article states that the 22nd Indiana and the 16th Tennessee suffered the most casualties; in actuality, the 33rd Alabama had 82% casualties to the 16th Tennessee's 59% and the 22nd Indiana's 65%. Private Matthews describes the action in these words: Brig. General S.A.M. Wood When the smoke finally cleared that evening, the Confederates had won a tactical victory at Perryville. However the approach of fresh Union forces and the increasingly untenable situation in Kentucky compelled Bragg to order a retreat. The 33rd and the rest of Bragg's army withdrew to Tennessee through the Cumberland Gap, leaving the Federals in possession of Kentucky for the rest of the war.General Bragg's Impossible Dream During the Battle of Perryville, the 33rd Alabama suffered an appalling casualty rate of 82%.National Park Service: 33rd Alabama Infantry. Some historians have questioned the accuracy of this figure; see Note 63 in the Wikipedia article \\"Battle of Perryville\\" for further information. Entering the battle with 500 men, the regiment came out with only 88 fit for duty.33rd Alabama Infantry Regiment Of the thirty-two men in the 33rd's Company B who fought at Perryville, two were killed on the field and nineteen more were wounded--of whom only nine would survive.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 12. After the battle, Private Matthews reported that the surviving members of the regiment carried their injured comrades to field hospitals, while others removed the personal effects from the dead to return to their families in Alabama. He reports that though exhausted from the day's fighting, the surviving troops spent all that night carrying water to their friends, gathering straw for them to lie on, and assisting the surgeons in caring for them. When some of the wounded complained of being cold, their comrades covered them with their own blankets. Upon returning to their camp later on, the survivors discovered that their left-behind knapsacks had been plundered by persons unknown. According to Matthews, \\"few of us carried knapsacks, afterwards.\\" Private Matthews reported that \\"for a few days after the battle, our right shoulders were quite sore from the rebound of our Enfield Rifles when firing, as they were after any prolonged firing, and some rifles kicked worse than others.\\" He equally reported that due to the loss of their horses by all four regimental officers who rode them into the fight, \\"our regimental officers left them in the rear [thereafter], when going into battle.\\" Matthews also related the account of a mortally wounded soldier named Ward who asked his \\"body servant\\" Jesse to return to Alabama and convey his final goodbye to his wife. Matthews emphasized that Jesse could easily have run away in the confusion and sought freedom with nearby Federal troops, but he chose to return home--entirely on his own--carrying his master's message. Fragging While fragging--the assassination of unpopular officers by their subordinates--is generally associated with the Vietnam War, incidents of this nature occurred during the Civil War as well. Private Matthews speaks of a \\"Lieut. Col. [Henry Virtner] Keep\\" in the 3rd Confederate Infantry Regiment, whom he describes as a \\"tyrant.\\" Keep was viewed as a martinet by his men after he punished them by ordering them to carry heavy fence rails or wooden poles as they marched; Matthews reports that his soldiers promised that he would not survive his first engagement. Although they did not manage to murder him, they were overjoyed to learn of Keep's departure after the battle.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 13. According to family records, Keep survived the war, dying in 1883. With regard to his own unit, Matthews says: \\"I never heard it rumored that any of our officers of the 33rd Alabama were ever shot by any of our men intentionally, for there were no tyrannical officers such as Colonel Keep in the regiment.\\" He says that discontented men who did not believe that they could \\"get justice\\" from their regimental officers were usually able to obtain a transfer to another unit. Action in Tennessee=Retreat into Tennessee After withdrawing from Perryville, General Bragg moved south toward Harrodsburg, Kentucky, where he linked up with another Confederate force under Major General Kirby Smith. From here he continued his retreat to Knoxville, Tennessee, where the army drew supplies described as: \\"flour, corn meal, bacon, fresh beef, rice, salt and the first soap that we had drawn in two months,\\" together with new uniforms and shoes. Here the regiment was rejoined by several previously ill soldiers, who had been left behind at hospitals in Chattanooga at the outset of the Kentucky Campaign. Tragedy on the rails On November 4, 1862, the 33rd Alabama was ordered to board a train which was scheduled to take them to Chattanooga. In a freak accident a few miles south of Cleveland, Tennessee, a large stick of wood fell from the locomotive tender as the train moved rapidly on a downhill grade, breaking the axle of one of the railcars immediately behind it and causing part of the train to derail. Pvt. Matthews reports that when the axle snapped on the boxcar he was in, all the wheels came off and \\"clogged\\" under the wheels of the car behind it (occupied by Co. G), causing its separation from the train. Meanwhile, the engine continued to pull the wheel-less B Company car two or three hundred yards down the track before it finally stopped. Several soldiers had been riding on the boxcar roofs: Matthews reported that these were \\"shook off, like shaking peaches from a tree, and badly jolted when they hit the ground.\\"W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 14. Others were pinned beneath and within the wreckage; some only escaped by \\"alighting on their heads.\\" A total of seventeen men were killed in the disaster, with sixty-seven others maimed; many of these would later die from their injuries.33rd Alabama Train Wreck Most of the deceased came from Co. G, the \\"Daleville Blues,\\" including the company commander, Captain Reuben Jackson Cooper. All were buried the next day in a trench dug just southeast of the railroad that was surrounded by a split-rail fence; this remained unmarked and largely forgotten until descendants of the departed erected a monument on the site in November 1989. Battle of Stones River General William Rosecrans leads Federal troops at the Battle of Stones River. Positions at the commencement of the Battle of Stones River. The 33rd Alabama was with Cleburne's Division, at the bottom left of the map. Following the Battle of Perryville, the 33rd Alabama-- together with the rest of Wood's brigade--was transferred to a new division commanded by Major General Patrick R. Cleburne, under whom the 33rd would serve for most of the rest of the war. By now Bragg had converted his \\"wings\\" into corps; Cleburne's division was assigned to the corps commanded by Lieutenant General William J. Hardee, in what was now officially called the Army of Tennessee.Thomas Lawrence Connelly: Autumn of Glory: The Army of Tennessee: 1862‚Äì65. Louisiana State University Press, 1971, pp. 30‚Äì32. After leaving Chattanooga, General Bragg and his army moved west until they reached the small town of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, southeast of Union-held Nashville. Private Matthews reports that the 33rd Alabama was tasked to serve as a rear guard for their brigade along the line of march, occasionally skirmishing with pursuing Federal forces while contending with muddy roads during the final portion of their journey. Knowing that Murfreesboro and the surrounding area were staunchly pro-Southern in sentiment, Bragg felt compelled to make a stand on relatively flat ground north of the city, even though several more- defensible areas lay further to the north and south. The Federal Army of the Cumberland, now under the command of Major General William S. Rosecrans, closed with Bragg in late December 1862, arriving at Murfreesboro on December 29 and moving into position the following day. Following a musical contest between Southern and Federal bands during the evening hours on the 30th, both armies prepared to attack each other at dawn on the 31st.Bands Battled on Eve of Stones River Clash, Murfreesboro Post, December 31, 2006. Incredibly, Bragg and Rosecrans had each made plans to assault each other's right flank, at almost the same moment. Hardee's corps--more than 10,000 troops in all-- would attack at dawn in a massive wave, hoping to catch their enemy off guard and preoccupied with eating breakfast and other morning activities, just as they had done at Shiloh where they had achieved complete surprise.E-History: Stone's River A ration of whiskey was issued to the troops at 8:00 pm; soon afterwards they bedded down for the night, sleeping on cornstalks in an effort to keep off the soggy ground.Diary of Charles Jacob Armstrong, Co. C, 33rd Alabama Volunteers, entry for December 30, 1862. Lieutenant Alfred Moore, the regimental adjutant, describes the action at Stones River and its aftermath in a letter to his mother, Amanda: Confederate defensive works at Tullahoma, Tennessee Private Matthews reported that when the battle first commenced, haze had obscured the field so much that visibility was limited to about fifty feet. He reported that during the initial charge, the Federals abandoned their \\"breakfast[s] on the fire,\\" together with tents, wagons, knapsacks, foodstuffs and other supplies. Blaming \\"inferior powder\\" for causing many of their Enfield rifles to fail at Perryville and now here, he indicates that most of his comrades threw away those weapons in favor of Federal Springfield Model 1861 rifles they found on the battlefield. Matthews equally writes that many soldiers were trading in their original-issue cedar canteens (from their Ft. McRee days) for the \\"cloth covered, block tin oval shaped Yankee canteen[s]\\" they found. Federal blankets, shelter halves, hats (which Matthews described as \\"good\\") and overcoats were also prized by the 33rd Alabama--those who could not find them on the field, would purchase them from others who had extras. Stones River ended on January 2, 1863, as a Federal victory: though Bragg had inflicted severe losses on Rosecrans' army, he had been unable to drive it from the field. With fresh Union reinforcements threatening to give Rosecrans an overwhelming advantage for a future attack,Scott Walker, Hell's Broke Loose in Georgia: Survival in a Civil War Regiment, pg. 70. Bragg chose to retreat to Tullahoma, Tennessee. Smallpox and snowballs During the 33rd's time in Tullahoma, several members of Company I (from Dale County) contracted smallpox, apparently from a soldier who had been on furlough to Columbus, Georgia.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 16‚Äì17. The entire regiment was ordered into quarantine, which entailed moving away from the rest of the army and into a nearby creek swamp, where they established camp on high ground and waited out the epidemic. Those who died there were buried in the swamp by other members of their mess, but were not accorded the military honors usually given to those who died in camp or in battle.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 17. Once this enforced isolation was revoked, The 33rd celebrated by taking the offensive in an entirely new kind of war. Private Matthews reports: After being removed from quarantine, the regiment witnessed the hanging of a Federal spy, then moved on to Wartrace, where they went into camp for a time. Camp life Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne, the \\"Stonewall of the West,\\" in whose division the 33rd would fight from Murfreesboro to Franklin Although the 33rd was taking a rest at Wartrace, not all of its time was spent leisurely. Its new divisional commander, General Cleburne, drilled his men and held marksmanship competitions together with frequent readiness and equipment inspections.Lance III, Joseph M., Major, USMC: Patrick R. Cleburne and the Tactical Employment of His Division at Chickamauga, pg. 29. All page numbers cited in this reference are as in the online PDF version, not in the manuscript itself. In his diary, SGT Jacob Armstrong of Co. C. indicates numerous days of drill and guard duty during this time. Cleburne's previous record of success went over well with his new troops; he insisted on weapons being clean and well-maintained at all times, and also that his soldiers attend to their own personal hygiene to the best extent possible. Cleburne encouraged competitiveness between his companies and regiments: the man who reported to his company's guard mount with the cleanest weapon and best appearance would be excused from guard duty for that shift, while at the regimental level, the five troops with the best rifles would be excused from duty and would instead be formed into a special reserve to take the place of guards who became sick or were removed for other reasons. A new blue-and-white regimental flag was issued, with \\"Perryville\\" and \\"Murfreesboro\\" written on it in large white letters, the original one having been virtually destroyed at those two engagements. In camp, soldiers of the regiment occupied themselves in various ways: \\"we carried wood, water, cooked, washed our clothes, cleaned our guns, conversed, wrote letters to our people at home, tussled, ran foot races, jumped, boxed or jollied each other in friendly ways; some recruits loafed or layed around and grieved of home until sent off to the hospital or died in camp. Other jolly souls sang songs, especially at night; others played various games of chance: cards, dice, kino or other games. We ... fished in creeks or rivers or went in bathing, and some frequently attended religious services ... Green bandsmen near us making discordant noise on their tin horns caused some of the boys to swear, though we liked the music after they had learned to play.\\"W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 18‚Äì19. Matthews reports that Wartrace was the last place where his regiment used the wall tents they had been issued at the beginning of their service. Once they left there, he says, the tents were either \\"captured or burned.\\" A sergeant assigned to the unit managed to abscond with all the pocketwatches in the regiment, whereupon he promptly deserted to the Federals. The 18th Alabama Battalion Early in 1863, the 33rd Alabama learned that a battalion of partisan rangers from Jackson County, Alabama, in the northern part of the state, was being \\"attached\\" to them for administrative and command purposes, without losing its identity. Recruited in the summer of 1862, the 1st Partisan Rangers Battalion was originally mounted and intended for local service.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, pp. 17‚Äì18. Composed of five companies that were later consolidated into three, the 18th was attached to the 33rd Alabama in January 1863 (after previously serving under General Nathan Bedford Forrest) and fought with the 33rd thereafter, while still remaining a separate organization. Commanded by Major John H. Gibson, it was also known as Gibson's Battalion.Alabama Department of Archives and History: 18th Alabama Battalion Chickamauga=Tullahoma Campaign Map of the Tullahoma Campaign: June‚ÄìJuly 1862 On June 24, 1863, the Federal Army of the Cumberland opened its Tullahoma Campaign in central Tennessee. This lasted until July 3, and resulted in Bragg's dislodgement from strong defensive positions at Tullahoma and nearby areas including Wartrace. Hearing the Federals open fire on the 24th, the 33rd Alabama cooked three days' rations of flour, beef, bacon and corn meal, then marched back to the main army at Tullahoma, which was evacuated around June 30. Bragg moved south toward Chattanooga, a strategically valuable city that was considered the \\"gateway\\" to Georgia and its vital railway center of Atlanta.Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park: \\"History and Culture\\" Halting at a big spring just outside the town of Harrison, Tennessee, the 33rd was initially ordered to guard the river crossings at this point. In September, the regiment was ordered to evacuate this position, and moved into Chattanooga.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 20. From Chattanooga they moved to Lafayette, Georgia, thence through Dug Gap in nearby Pigeon Mountain, where Private Matthews reports that the regiment moved \\"Indian file, one behind another, crawling under, around and over, trees, logs and brush that had been cut and fell on the road through the gap; at times in [a] deep cut in the road full of brush and logs with a high wall on each side ...\\" The regiment was shelled by nearby Federal troops as they continued on their journey, but managed to make it to McLemore Cove. Engagement at Chickamauga Confederate troops advancing at Chickamauga, by Alfred Waud Having forced Bragg to evacuate Chattanooga on September 6 through a series of skillful maneuvers, Rosecrans ordered his army to advance along three different roads into northwestern Georgia in pursuit of the Army of Tennessee. With the Federals divided and unable to support each other due to the mountainous terrain, Bragg chose to concentrate on one Union corps, the XIV Corps, which had advanced through the same gap taken by the 33rd at Pigeon Mountain (and adjacent passes), and was moving toward Lafayette. An abortive assault launched by Cleyburne's and Hindman's divisions at Davis's Cross Roads allowed the Federals to escape to safety, so Bragg now turned north, where Rosecran's main force was rapidly concentrating at Lee and Gordon's Mill along Chickamauga Creek. Having been promised three extra divisions--including two led by the renowned Lieutenant General James Longstreet--Bragg decided to attack Rosecrans' army. Skirmishing commenced on September 18, with the main battle opening on September 19. This engagement would mark one of the very few major contests of the war in which the Confederate force would outnumber the Federals: 65,000 to 60,000.Civil War Trust: Chickamauga. Some historians give the Confederate numbers at 68,000. Bragg's plan was for the Confederates to push past the Federals at Chickamauga Creek, then move north toward Chattanooga. If executed correctly, this maneuver would force Rosecrans to give battle against superior numbers under unfavorable conditions, or to withdraw. Unfortunately for Bragg things did not go exactly as he had intended, and by the afternoon of the 19th his forces were strung out along a densely wooded battlefront roughly in length. With the Federals putting up a terrific fight and showing no disposition to give way, Bragg ordered the 33rd Alabama and the rest of Cleburne's division (which had been on the left side of his army up to this point)Lance III, Joseph M., Major, USMC: Patrick R. Cleburne and the Tactical Employment of His Division at Chickamauga, pg. 84. to move north to the Youngblood Farm, near the far right flank. Though most of the fighting had shifted further south over the course of the afternoon, Bragg understood that the main effort had to come at the opposite end of the field if he was to win. He still believed he could turn the Federal flank in the north, thereby obtaining control over the Lafayette Road and positioning himself between the Federals and Chattanooga, which was his key objective.Woodworth, Steven E., Editor: The Chickamauga Campaign, p. 104.Lance III, Joseph M., Major, USMC: Patrick R. Cleburne and the Tactical Employment of His Division at Chickamauga, pg. 73‚Äì74. Cleburne's night attack at Battle of Chickamauga, involving the 33rd Alabama. Cleburne's position lies near the top of the Confederate line, which is shown in red. Night assault at Winfrey Field Wading Chickamauga creek after stripping off their shoes, pants and socks, the 33rd Alabama reached the Youngblood farm around 5:30 pm. After reporting to General Polk, Cleburne expected to be ordered to bed his men down for the evening, as night combat was extremely rare during the Civil War.Woodworth, Steven E., Editor: The Chickamauga Campaign, p. 105. However, to his immense astonishment, Cleburne received orders to form his troops into line in the fading light, and prepare to launch an immediate assault on the Federals to his front. The 33rd Alabama and the rest of Wood's Brigade took center position in the attack formation, with Polk's Brigade to their right, and Deshler's brigade to their left. Cleburne began his advance at 6:00 pm, through a tiny meadow locally known as Winfrey Field. This plot was described as being \\"200-300 yards in depth, and long enough to nearly cover the length of his brigade.\\".Lance III, Joseph M., Major, USMC: Patrick R. Cleburne and the Tactical Employment of His Division at Chickamauga, pg. 86. The 18th Alabama advanced to the left of the 33rd, while the 16th Alabama and the 45th, 32nd and 15th Mississippi regiments advanced to its right. Three artillery batteries were placed in support, though in the gathering darkness they had potential to inflict as much damage on their friends as on the enemy. This enemy consisted of the 5th Kentucky, 1st Ohio and 32nd Indiana Infantry Regiments (belonging to Baldwin's and Willich's brigades of the Federal Army), who awaited them just behind a split rail fence near the treeline.Woodworth, Steven E., Editor: The Chickamauga Campaign, p. 106. The 33rd and its sisters advanced cautiously toward the Federals, who quickly opened up on them from the far side of the field. At one point about halfway across, the 16th Alabama suddenly halted; Adams ordered the 33rd to stop, as well. The two regiments resumed their advance after about ten minutes or so, though in the darkness they now had to deal with stragglers firing on them from behind, as well as the enemy to their front. One incident of friendly fire claimed the life of Lieutenant Alfred Moore, who was accidentally shot in the neck from behind by a straggler.Woodworth, Steven E., Editor: The Chickamauga Campaign, p. 06. A few companies of the 33rd began to waver, but Adams quickly corralled them and got them back into the fight.Lance III, Joseph M., Major, USMC: Patrick R. Cleburne and the Tactical Employment of His Division at Chickamauga, pg. 89. With the attack now stalling, artillery batteries were brought up in the darkness together with supporting troops under Brigadier General John Jackson; these finally drove the Federals back. The 33rd Alabama crossed the Federal breastworks, heading straight for the nearby 6th Indiana.Woodworth, Steven E., Editor: The Chickamauga Campaign, p. 107. At this point, with their assault on the verge of success, the commander of the 16th Alabama suddenly ordered his regiment to retreat, upon which they scampered back toward the safety of their own lines. Even though his left flank was now exposed, Colonel Adams chose to close with the 6th Indiana in the pitch-dark woods, where savage hand-to-hand fighting ensued before the Hoosiers finally withdrew. Winfrey Field caught fire behind them from the artillery blasts, though the Rebel shells were mostly sailing over the defenders' heads. Friendly units were now firing into each other in the darkness, lit up only by muzzle flashes and the blaze in the field, which threatened to consume the wounded of each army who lay there. Mass confusion quickly set in on both sides, and although the Confederates achieved some success their attack ultimately ground to a halt, leaving the Federals in control of La Fayette Road.Lance III, Joseph M., Major, USMC: Patrick R. Cleburne and the Tactical Employment of His Division at Chickamauga, pg. 74‚Äì75. Undeterred by this setback, Bragg decided to attack again the next morning, first in the north and then moving southward as the assault progressed, hoping to \\"roll up\\" the Union forces.Lance III, Joseph M., Major, USMC: Patrick R. Cleburne and the Tactical Employment of His Division at Chickamauga, pg. 75. Private Matthews reports that the men of the 33rd slept that night \\"in line of battle in the woods, without taking off any of our belongings except shoes and blankets.\\" He reports that the regiment was resupplied with ammunition from a wagon that came up to their position; they also drew rations of crackers and bacon for their breakfast the next morning.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 20. According to Major, Cleburne's men had not eaten anything at all during the entirety of September 19. Major, pg. 102. Several men from the regiment had failed to remove their ramrods from their rifles as they fired them during the engagement; according to Matthews, these were stuck in trees as high as twenty feet above the ground; others were buried partway in the soil.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 21. Assault on La Fayette Road Cleburne's assault at Kelly Field on 20 September Miscommunication between General Bragg and his subordinates, together with blunders by General Polk, would relegate the 33rd and its sister regiments to a series of futile assaults on the Federal left flank on September 20. At 7:25 that morning, as his men were eating breakfast, Cleburne received orders from Polk to attack the Federal line in a new location known as Kelly Field, in conjunction with troops of Brigadier General John C. Breckinridge, a former Vice President of the United States who had sided with the South.Lance III, Joseph M., Major, USMC: Patrick R. Cleburne and the Tactical Employment of His Division at Chickamauga, pg. 102. Wood's brigade had become tangled with Stewart's division (part of Longstreet's \\"wing\\" of the army), and none of the attackers or their officers realized that they were charging directly into six Federal divisions. General Wood's brigade became separated from the other attacking units, and quickly found itself on its own, attacking the Federals on high ground against overwhelming odds. The 33rd Alabama began its advance about 10:00 am, in conjunction with the nearby 16th Alabama. The latter regiment quickly took cover after the first volley from the Union line, while the 33rd continued to advance until they reached a small ravine, where they sheltered for nearly an hour until ordered to move forward again.Lance III, Joseph M., Major, USMC: Patrick R. Cleburne and the Tactical Employment of His Division at Chickamauga, pp. 107‚Äì08. The two regiments now moved to a point about 275 yards from the Union line, when the 33rd was suddenly hit with murderous artillery and rifle fire from its right flank. Completely bereft of support from either side, the 33rd continued to advance, ultimately achieving something no other Confederate regiment in that sector managed to do: it crossed the La Fayette Road, General Bragg's main objective. However, it was forced to retreat almost as soon as it had done so, having lost 16 killed and 133 wounded out of the 219 men who had started the assault.Lance III, Joseph M., Major, USMC: Patrick R. Cleburne and the Tactical Employment of His Division at Chickamauga, pg. 108. Brigadier General Mark Lowrey, who became 33rd's Brigade Commander after Chickamagua. Confusion and miscommunication were not confined to the Southern forces. A botched order issued by General Rosecrans opened a large gap in another part of the Federal line: Longstreet quickly exploited it, turning the Federal right flank and crippling their defense. Rosecrans and most of his army fled the field, and only a desperate last-minute stand by Major General George H. Thomas saved the Union army from complete annihilation. The 33rd Alabama took part in a renewed assault on Kelly Field late in the afternoon, but due to its diminished numbers, it played little appreciable role in the final rout of Federal forces in that sector.Lance III, Joseph M., Major, USMC: Patrick R. Cleburne and the Tactical Employment of His Division at Chickamauga, pg. 108, 114. Though Major says that Wood's Brigade took no part in this assault, Matthews seems to indicate that they might have played a small role: see Matthews, pg. 21. The Federals retreated all the way back to Chattanooga, where they awaited an immediate attack by Bragg's exultant army.Lance III, Joseph M., Major, USMC: Patrick R. Cleburne and the Tactical Employment of His Division at Chickamauga, pg. 77‚Äì78. Bragg, however, threw away the greatest victory in his career by dallying on the battlefield to collect left-behind equipment and tend to his wounded, rather than quickly pursuing and destroying the demoralized Federals.Lance III, Joseph M., Major, USMC: Patrick R. Cleburne and the Tactical Employment of His Division at Chickamauga, pg. 79. Upon reaching Chattanooga, Rosecrans' army quickly improved upon previous Confederate fortifications there; this would ensure their survival and the ultimate defeat of Bragg's forces. Matthews writes that the regiment drew more crackers and bacon that evening, sent their canteens to be filled, then \\"slept soundly, after the tension of the last two days.\\" The next day was spent burying the dead, with men buried either singly or in pairs: \\"each wrapped in his blanket with his hat over his face.\\" Major Gibson was mortally wounded during the fighting of the 20th. The final casualty for the 33rd Alabama at Chickamauga was their longtime brigade commander, Brigadier General Wood. Never mentioned in Cleburne's or anyone else's after-action reports, his performance during the assault at Winfrey Field remains shrouded in controversy. Privately accused of cowardace in the face of the enemy, and reportedly threatened with a court-martial by Cleburne, Wood resigned his commission soon after the battle ended, and returned to his law practice in Alabama.Lance III, Joseph M., Major, USMC: Patrick R. Cleburne and the Tactical Employment of His Division at Chickamauga, pg. 112‚Äì13. According to another source, Wood was deeply incensed at these charges, and resigned \\"in a fit of anger\\" over what the author describes as \\"unfounded charges.\\" See L.B. Williams: Autobiography of Mark P. Lowrey. Command of his brigade passed to Brigadier General Mark Lowrey, a Southern Baptist minister who was known as the Confederacy's \\"Preacher General.\\"Lance III, Joseph M., Major, USMC: Patrick R. Cleburne and the Tactical Employment of His Division at Chickamauga, pg. 90. Chattanooga to Ringgold Gap=The Siege of Chattanooga Battles for Chattanooga. The 33rd Alabama and the rest of Cleburne's Division were on the far right flank of the Confederate line. The Battle of Missionary Ridge. The 33rd Alabama fought here during the Battles of Chattanooga. Following the debacle at Chickamauga and his subsequent failure to prevent the routed Union forces from escaping to Chattanooga, Bragg placed that city under siege after hearing that his foes had just six days of food remaining.The Chattanooga Campaign: A Summary Entrenching his forces atop Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge overlooking the city and the Tennessee River, Bragg soon learned that he would be facing a new opponent: Ulysses S. Grant. Fresh from his victory at Vicksburg, Grant had been ordered to take command of all Federal forces in the region; his first action upon arriving was to remove Rosecrans and replace him with George Thomas, who had saved the Union army at Chickamauga. With 50,000 new reinforcements to assist him, Grant opened a so-called \\"Cracker Line\\" to the starving Federals in the city at the Battle of Brown's Ferry; here the 15th Alabama, another regiment recruited from the same part of the state as the 33rd, was driven from the field after being outnumbered and overwhelmed by attacking Federals.Battle of Brown's Ferry The 33rd Alabama dug in on the west end of Missionary Ridge on November 22, behind a vineyard at its base. Rifle pits were built, and guards rotated there every 24 hours; those not on guard duty set to work clearing all the vegetation from the west slope of the ridge, chopping the trees so that the tops fell toward Chattanooga, creating a natural barrier of tangled tree limbs. Matthews reports that the removal of these trees allowed the cold autumn breezes to chill the troops on the ridge, since the Southerners had nothing but small tents to break the wind. He reports gazing in wonder at the valley below him, where the campfires of thousands of Federal soldiers \\"[showed] picturesquely at night.\\" A large siege gun was hauled up Lookout Mountain to shell the Union camps and Chattanooga; Matthews recalled that \\"... at the flash of the gun at night, some soldiers attracted out attention by yelling and watching the long flight and bursting of the shells, [which] were especially attractive to us while standing, squatting or sitting around our camp fires.\\" He says that rations, which had heretofore been plentiful, were \\"short\\" during this time. At this point, Bragg chose to divide his army: Longstreet's 4,000 soldiers were ordered to move north to Knoxville to deal with a separate Federal force there under Ambrose Burnside. On November 22, he ordered General Cleburne to take his division, including the 33rd Alabama, together with another division under General Simon B. Buckner to assist. Seeing movement in the Southern lines, General Grant ordered Federal forces to attack near a small rise called Orchard Knob; their success, though limited in scope, led Bragg to recall Cleburne (who was in the process of loading his troops onto their trains); he took up a position just behind his former works which had been occupied by other Southerners after their departure the day before. Holding Tunnel Hill Missionary Ridge by Cleburne's division, including the 33rd Alabama Having successfully lifted the Siege of Chattanooga, General Grant now resolved on a double envelopment of Bragg's army. Major General William T. Sherman was ordered to attack with 20,000 men from the north along Missionary Ridge, while Major General Joseph Hooker was directed to attack from the south along Lookout Mountain, overwhelm the Southern forces there, then continue on to cut off Bragg's retreat while Sherman and Thomas pummeled him from the north and west. The contest kicked off on the morning of November 24, as Hooker drove Confederate forces from Lookout Mountain in the so-called \\"Battle Above the Clouds,\\" while Sherman crossed the Tennessee River and took up positions along what he thought was the far edge of Missionary Ridge--only to learn that he had occupied a nearby hill, called Billy Goat Hill, instead. The 33rd Alabama, entrenched atop the south end of Missionary Ridge near Bragg's headquarters, heard the sounds of battle on Lookout Mountain, but could not see the action due to a dense fog that had enveloped it. Realizing that his right flank was vulnerable to Sherman's impending attack, Bragg ordered Cleburne at 2pm to double-time from the southern to the northernmost portion of his line--just as he had done at Chickamauga--and take up a new position opposite Sherman at a place called \\"Tunnel Hill,\\" where a tunnel of the East Tennessee and Georgia railroad passed through Missionary Ridge.Reports of Patrick Cleburne, Battle of Chattanooga Lowrey's brigade, including the 33rd, dug in to the south of the tunnel, but \\"only skirmishing\\" took place on that day. Ordered to attack at dawn on November 25, General Sherman delayed until about 7am, when he sent his skirmishers forward.McDonough, James Lee, Chattanooga, a Death Grip on the Confederacy, pg. 143. The real attack did not begin until sometime between 10 and 10:30 am. With other units moving onto the ridge to his left, Cleburne shifted Lowrey's Brigade to a spur projecting from the ridge, just north of the tunnel. Advancing into murderous fire, the Federals came to within eighty yards of the Southern positions before a furious Confederate counterattack forced them back,McDonough, James Lee, Chattanooga, a Death Grip on the Confederacy, pg. 149. leading Sherman to call off the attack. Cleburne indicated that the brunt of the battle was borne by Smith's Texas Brigade and three Arkansas regiments in Gowan's Brigade; the 33rd Alabama saw \\"heavy skirmishing,\\" but did not play a major role since the Federals never approached closer than 100-200 yards to their sector of the line. Cleburne's men had done their job, capturing eight enemy flags and 500 prisoners. Just then, disaster struck. Further south along the center of Bragg's line, Federal troops under General Thomas smashed through Confederate positions at the base of the ridge, sweeping up the hill and driving Bragg's men before them. With his army disintegrating before his eyes, Bragg ordered Cleburne to hold the Federals off long enough to let the rest of his men escape. The 33rd Alabama attacked approaching skirmishers in the gathering darkness, allowing the remainder of Bragg's army to cross Chickamauga Creek to the east and retreat into Georgia. Since his division had held more-or-less together during the rout, Cleburne now found his regiments--including the 33rd Alabama--serving as the rearguard of the Army of Tennessee.McDonough, James Lee, Chattanooga, a Death Grip on the Confederacy, pg. 211.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 23. Ringgold Gap--the \\"wall of fire\\" The Battle of Ringgold Gap from Hooker's perspective. The gap itself is between the center mountain and the one on the right. The 33rd Alabama was atop the center mountain, about halfway between its middle and the gap. As his army continued to retreat, General Bragg became concerned by the deep mud slowing his supply trains as he passed through the mountains near the town of Ringgold. Fearful that pursuing Federals would catch up and destroy them--and with them, his army--Bragg ordered Cleburne to \\"hold this position at all hazards.\\"U.S. Civil War: Battle of Ringgold Gap The 33rd Alabama crossed the waist-deep, icy Chickamauga Creek on November 27 stripped from the waist down, \\"as the cold wind was stinging our exposed anatomy.\\" Finding hot ashes from other regiments' campfires, the Alabamians dried themselves and put their clothes back on, then slept beside the creek bank on the frozen ground. As the rest of their division moved on the next day, the 33rd was left with elements of the 45th Alabama and some of Joseph Wheeler's cavalry to guard the creek against the oncoming Federals. Advance Federal elements skirmished with them as the 33rd and Wheeler's Cavalry slowly backtracked toward Ringgold Gap, turning several times to fire, retreating a short distance, then turning to fire again. Meanwhile, in the gap itself, Cleburne deployed his division in the face of the oncoming Federals. With barely 4,000 men and only two cannon to hold off Joseph Hooker's 16,000 attacking troops,McDonough, James Lee, Chattanooga, a Death Grip on the Confederacy, pg. 220. Cleburne arranged his troops across both sides of the narrow pass, ordering them to conceal themselves from view and wait for his signal. Thirty minutes later the 33rd and their friends finally backed into the gap; Matthews reports that the other regiments had done such a good job of concealing themselves that he and his friends never noticed them until they had passed their positions. The 33rd was ordered to take its place with the rest of their brigade in the center atop White Oak Ridge,Official After-Action Report of General Mark P. Lowrey. Lowrey refers to this engagement as the \\"Battle of Taylor's Ridge\\" in his report. on the pass's northern side.Cleburne: The Defense of Ringgold Gap They arrived just in time; one witness of the battle would later say: \\"two minutes [more] would have been too late.\\" When Hooker's lead elements entered the mountain pass, Cleburne allowed them to get to within fifty yards of his men before ordering them to open fire. Reeling from the first volleys, the astonished Federals fell back, but quickly regrouped and mounted one furious counterattack after another, seeking first to turn Cleburne's right flank (where the 33rd Alabama was), then his left.McDonough, James Lee, Chattanooga, a Death Grip on the Confederacy, pp. 222‚Äì23. Each renewed assault ran into a withering Confederate response, described by one history as \\"a wall of fire;\\"Alabama: Her History, Resources, War Record and Public Men, pg. 641. one of Cleburne's regiments exhausted its ammunition, and resorted to throwing rocks before the reserve came up and relieved them. Ringgold Gap became a slaughterhouse over the next four hours as Hooker fed regiment after regiment into the fray, only to see each thrown back with severe losses; Private Sam Watkins of the 1st Tennessee Infantry described the gap as having \\"the appearance of a roof of a house, shingled with dead Yankees ... From the foot to the top of the hill was covered with the slain, all lying on their faces ... The ground was piled with dead Yankees; they were lying in heaps.\\"Sam Watkins: Co. Aytch: A Side Show of the Big Show, \\"Ringgold Gap.\\" These three quotes are given in reverse order from Watkins' original rendering. Once his columns had reached safety further south in Dalton, Bragg ordered Cleburne to pull back; he withdrew his men, and Hooker took possession of the pass around 2 PM. In the midst of all the carnage, the 33rd Alabama had lost only one man; their division as a whole had lost only twenty killed and 201 wounded, while holding off a Federal force four times their number for nearly five hours.Cozzens, Peter. The Shipwreck of Their Hopes: The Battles for Chattanooga.

The \\"Thanks of Congress\\" was an official resolution of the Confederate Congress (the Federal Congress had the same practice) that was one of the highest possible honors the South could bestow, during the war. But the war was far from over, as the Alabamians and their friends would soon learn. The savage waltz=Wintering in Georgia Civil War era railroad tunnel at Tunnel Hill. The 33rd Alabama occupied several crude log cabins on the hill above this tunnel in the winter of 1863‚Äì64. Having safely withdrawn to Dalton, Georgia, General Bragg directed Cleburne to camp at nearby Tunnel Hill, a town bearing the same name as the spot he had defended atop Missionary Ridge. Private Matthews reports that the 33rd Alabama was given \\"some cabins ... above the tunnel ... some were of round oak poles, others of split oak log, their cracks daubed with clay.\\" Captured shelter halves were used as doors, and the men wintered there as best they could. He writes that those who died here were buried nearby; the regiment would accompany them to their final resting place \\"with arms [rifles] reversed, and sounded taps; however, [we] did not always fire blank cartridges from our guns, for fear of exciting other sick men in camp.\\" Though they worried about the nearly worthless currency they were being paid in, \\"there was not as much complaint as one might suppose, as all realized that the [Confederate] Government was doing all it could for us.\\" Matthews blamed \\"hospital rats\\" for most of the grumbling, and observed that troops in these winter quarters played cards, dominoes, dice or keno; those who had a dollar, said he, could go to minstrel shows. Not everyone in the camp had the best interests of their comrades at heart: \\"two or more sharpers,\\" said he, would accost soldiers doing various chores and seek to con them out of their earnings. One regiment was assigned to guard duty every day; whenever the 33rd Alabama drew this duty, they packed up their gear and marched a mile or so to the front lines, leaving behind their sick and a guard over their other property. Joseph E. Johnston, who took command of the Army of Tennessee on December 27, 1863. On December 2, 1863, The 33rd Alabama and their comrades in the Army of Tennessee learned that they would be getting a new commander: Braxton Bragg, who had led the army since the Kentucky Campaign, had resigned his position. General Hardee was given temporary charge of the force, but on December 27 General Joseph Johnston, a veteran leader who would prove popular with many of his troops,Sam Watkins: Company Aytch: A Side Show of the Big Show, Chapter XI: \\"Dalton\\", section \\"General Joseph E. Johnston; also Chapter XII: \\"Hundred Days Battle,\\" section \\"Removal of General Joseph E. Johnston.\\" took command. Dalton With Chattanooga safe and the Confederates retreating, General Grant sent Sherman to Mississippi, against the Confederate rail center in Meridian. Learning of this move, Johnston ordered two divisions of his army, including Cleburne's, to go to the aid of their compatriots in that state. This, in turn, led General Thomas to launch a series of probing attacks along Johnston's lines at Dalton, where he quickly learned that the new Confederate commander was someone to be reckoned with.Dalton I The 33rd Alabama had proceeded as far as West Point, Alabama, when they were recalled to Dalton. Instead of returning to Tunnel Hill, they were ordered into camp along a creek east of town, where they were put to work digging trenches between that point and their old campsite on the hill.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 26. A new flag was presented to the regiment with the words: \\"Perryville\\", \\"Murfreesboro\\", \\"Chickamauga\\" and \\"Ringgold Gap\\" embroidered on it, together with an oval- shaped disc in the center containing \\"33 ALA.\\"W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 26; see also Flag of the 33rd Alabama Infantry, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History. With the Federals having retreated temporarily, life at Dalton returned to normal--at least for the time being. Rifle practices were held, with targets set up at various distances up to two-hundred yards, and a \\"sham battle\\" was fought using blank cartridges. Rocky Face Ridge Assault on Dug Gap, part of the Battle of Rocky Face Ridge West of Dalton, Johnston entrenched a large portion of his army along the crest of Rocky Face Ridge, a rugged mountain extending north-to-south that was pierced by passes at Buzzard Roost Gap, Dug Gap and Snake Creek Gap. Sherman had returned to Georgia after winning a victory at Meridian; here he was given command of a new Federal force known as the Military Division of the Mississippi, consisting of three armies totaling 98,500 men.Eicher, David J. The Longest Night: A Military History of the Civil War. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2001. , pg. 696. Johnston, for his part, had 50,000 men at this time.McKay, John E. \\"Atlanta Campaign.\\" In Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History, edited by David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2000. , pg. 129. See Battle of Rocky Face Ridge. When part of Sherman's army passed through undefended Snake Creek Gap toward Resaca in the Confederate rear, the 33rd Alabama and other units were sent to stop them. Ordered to assault a height near the gap, the 33rd drove the Federals from the ridge, then drove off fierce counterattacks throughout the day. Some soldiers threw rocks at their enemies, while others pried large boulders loose and rolled them down the hill onto the attacking Northerners, who finally withdrew. All these efforts went for naught, however, as Sherman ultimately flanked the \\"Georgia Gibraltar\\"Battle of Rocky Face Ridge and forced Johnston to withdraw toward Resaca. Fire and maneuver Following their retreat from Rocky Face Ridge, Johnston's Army of Tennessee engaged in a war of fight- and-get-flanked, in which Johnston would first dig in at some defensible location, whereupon Sherman would launch diversionary attacks on his smaller force, while flanking the Confederates elsewhere.Parfitt, Allen, Dalton to Atlanta: Sherman vs. Johnston At Resaca the 33rd Alabama was deployed with the rest of Hardee's Corps along Camp Creek, northwest of town; a series of Federal attacks on their lines were largely repulsed, until Sherman was able to flank Johnston and force him to retreat yet again.Battle of Resaca: May 14 Additional battles at Adairsville and New Hope--though the latter was a Confederate victory--did nothing to change the strategic situation, as Sherman inched closer and closer to Atlanta. Moving into the Dallas area on May 26, the Federals attacked Johnston's right flank at Pickett's Mill on May 27.Morton McInvale, Battle of Pickett's Mill: Foredoomed to Oblivion, pp. 60-69. Pickett's Mill Cabin at Pickett's Mill Determined to outflank Johnston's latest defensive position in the Allatoona Pass, Sherman moved to the southwest, intending to circle around Allatoona and cut off Johnston's retreat. But Johnston beat him to the punch, pulling back and moving toward Dallas. After a clash at New Hope Church stopped the Federal advance, both sides rushed additional troops into the area; among them was Cleyburne's Division, which deployed on the far right flank of the Southern army in densely wooded terrain with Lowrey's Brigade (including the 33rd Alabama) in reserve on its left.Civil War Virtual Tours: Pickett's Mill: \\"7:00 AM.\\" Opposite them were three Federal divisions belonging to Major Generals Thomas J. Wood, Jacob D. Cox and Milo S. Hascall; the overall plan was for Sherman's army to attack the Confederate right flank. For this fight, the 33rd mustered 525 men present for duty, with the number of \\"effectives\\" rated at 493.Civil War Virtual Tours: Pickett's Mill: \\"Confederate Order of Battle\\" The battle began at 7:00 am, when Cleburne sent Govan's Arkansas Brigade forward in a reconnaissance in force against the Federal left flank. Haskell's men quickly engaged the Southerners, while other Federal forces prepared to counterattack.Civil War Virtual Tours: Pickett's Mill: \\"9:30 AM\\" Just as Cleburne ordered Govan's men to return to their original lines, they were attacked by two Federal divisions led by General Oliver O. Howard, who had swung out beyond the Federal left flank, seeking to turn the Confederate right. Cleburne extended his division in that direction toward a wheatfield; he also ordered his pioneers to rapidly construct trails to facilitate movement of men and supplies between his brigades.Civil War Virtual Tours: Pickett's Mill: \\"4:00 PM.\\" Incredibly, the Federal commander, General Howard, only ordered a single brigade to attack, even though six were available to him. This unit quickly became separated amid thick underbrush and rugged terrain, with catastrophic results.Civil War Virtual Tours: Pickett's Mill: \\"5:00 PM\\" Additional Federal units were eventually sent forward, but since they got no support from other units on their line, Cleyburne was free to order Lowrey's Brigade--including the 33rd Alabama--to move to Govan's assistance. Lowrey's men arrived around 5:30, with the 33rd in the lead.Brad Butkovich,The Battle of Pickett's Mill, pg. 108. Each regiment was ordered to clear the one in front of it, then turn left and come onto line. The savage waltz: Federal and Confederate movements during the Atlanta Campaign, from Dalton to the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain Confederate General John H. Kelly now came up, and ordered two Arkansas regiments to the left of the 33rd to charge the Federals; the 33rd Alabama chose to charge with them, with seven companies accompanying the Arkansas troops, and the other four veering off into a wooded hollow to the right.Brad Butkovich,The Battle of Pickett's Mill, pg. 109. The Federals (belonging to the 5th Kentucky) attempted to regroup, but were hit by the 33rd's four right companies, who engaged them briefly in a cornfield before retreating to the safety of the woods, where they continued to fire on the Federals. General Lowrey arrived at this time, personally rallying the 33rd by riding back and forth among them on his horse 'Rebel' as the battle raged around him. The Federals broke and ran, then regrouped, with both sides continuing to blaze away at each other across the cornfield in the gathering twilight.Civil War Virtual Tours: Pickett's Mill: \\"7:00 PM.\\" Around 10:00 pm, a night charge by a nearby Confederate brigade under Hiram B. Granbury pushed the Northerners back, causing other Federal units to withdraw and giving the Confederates a victory at Pickett's Mill.Civil War Virtual Tours: Pickett's Mill: \\"10:00 PM.\\" Their win would go for naught, though, as Sherman simply moved around the Southerners, heading for Marietta. Here he dislodged Johnston once again, as the two-to-one advantage in Federal numbers and their greater firepower proved too much for Johnston to resist.A series of maps depicting movements during the Battle of Pickett's mill may be seen here Civil War Virtual Tours Pickett's Mill 7:00 AM.

Kennesaw Mountain Unit positions during the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain. Cleburne's division is near the center of the Confederate line; the 33rd Alabama was part of Lowrey's brigade By late June 1864, Sherman and Johnston were dancing a strange ballet of attack and maneuver, but the Federal commander abruptly decided to try something new. In later years Sherman indicated that his officers and opponents had become used to his propensity for flanking movements; he wanted to shake things up, he said, and demonstrate that he was capable of different tactics if a favorable opportunity arose.Liddell Hart, B. H. Sherman: Soldier, Realist, American. New York: Da Capo Press, 1993. . First published in 1929 by Dodd, Mead & Co., pg. 266. With rain and mud rendering movement difficult, Sherman decided to assault Johnston head-on at Kennesaw Mountain, a 1,808-foot ridge that dominated the surrounding countryside--including the railroad on which he depended for supplies. Johnston had constructed miles of trenches and fortifications on Kennesaw and nearby hills; Cleburne's Division was ordered to take a position in the center of the Confederate line.Battle of Kennesaw Mountain Confederate breastworks at Kennesaw Mountain As it turned out, the main Federal attack would come in Cleburne's direction. The 33rd Alabama, with the rest of Lowrey's brigade, was deployed to the right side of Cheatham Hill, facing two Federal divisions led by Jefferson C. Davis and John Newton--around 8,000 men in all.About North Georgia: Battle of Kennesaw Mountain Newton would attack the sector held by the 33rd, which lay across a shallow creek situated in a valley about twenty feet deep that gave way to sloping ground, all of which was densely forested and covered with thick underbrush that made a proper pre-attack reconnaissance impossible.Earl J. Hess, Kennesaw Mountain: Sherman, Johnston and the Atlanta Campaign, pg. 98. Felled trees and sharpened stakes driven into the ground complicated the Federal attack, which kicked off with an artillery barrage around 8:00 am on June 27. Though the Northerners managed to make some progress at first, ferocious fire from the 33rd and the rest of their compatriots drove the Federals back. Having lost 3,000 casualties to the Southerners' 1,000, Sherman finally called off the assault and left the field to his foes; a few days later he flanked Johnston once more, causing the Confederates to withdraw yet again and leading to Johnston's dismissal by Jefferson Davis on July 17.CWSAC Battle Summaries: Kennesaw Mountain. The new commander of the Army of Tennessee was John Bell Hood, a hard-charging general who had spent part of the war serving under Longstreet in Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Although he had demonstrated great personal bravery numerous times on the battlefield and was regarded as one of the best brigade and division commanders in the entire Confederate Army, Hood's former boss seems to have questioned his fitness for this level of command. \\"Hood is a gallant fighter,\\" Robert E. Lee is reported to have said upon hearing of his former subordinate's promotion; \\"but I am doubtful as to the other qualities necessary.\\"William Royal Oake, On the Skirmish Line Behind a Friendly Tree, pg. 355. Private Matthews, upon hearing that Hood had taken command, says that he \\"... was known to us as a hard fighter ... all agreed that we had hard work in front of us.\\" Atlanta Confederate defensive works at Atlanta. A death in the family After taking command of the Army of Tennessee, General Hood immediately attacked Sherman in a series of spectacular but ill-advised assaults that ultimately sealed his fate at Atlanta. The first of these came at Peachtree Creek, where the 33rd Alabama was held in reserve and played no role in the contest. Hood's men were initially successful, but miscommunication and fierce Federal counterattacks finally turned the tide in Sherman's favor, and the Army of Tennessee was forced back into their fortifications around the city.CWSAC Battle Summaries: Peachtree Creek. One day after Peachtree Creek the 33rd Alabama lost its regimental commander, Colonel Samuel Adams, who had been with it from its inception. Walking along the front line early that morning inspecting his men, Adams was shot by a Federal sharpshooter; he sat down by a small oak tree with both hands over his heart, and died there. Lieutenant Colonel Robert Crittenden took command of the regiment that same day. Battle of Atlanta Despising Sherman's overwhelming numbers and determined to renew his offensive, General Hood decided to attack James B. McPherson's Army of the Tennessee (not to be confused with Hood's own Army of Tennessee). Withdrawing from his outer line of defenses into his interior fortifications, Hood successfully enticed the Federals to move forward, then sent his cavalry to raid Sherman's exposed supply lines while ordering General Hardee's corps-- including Cleyburne's Division and the 33rd Alabama--to hit the Union left flank.NPS Battle Summary: Atlanta The 33rd engaged around noon on July 22, charging into a wooded area and capturing \\"prisoners, guns and accouterments, knapsacks and blankets, files and an ambulance.\\" The regiment stopped at a nearby creek to fill their canteens, which gave the Federal defenders time to bring up artillery and reinforcements; these blasted the 33rd as they emerged from the creek valley and charged through a field and up a hill toward their lines. Private Matthews describes the action in these words: When one Lieutenant in the regiment realized that the captured Federal ambulance contained a 10-gallon keg of whiskey, he immediately sent soldiers back to guard it until it could be safely removed. Once the 33rd had finished fortifying its position, the whiskey was doled out at the rate of one gill per man, measured in a tin cup. Digging in Robert Crittenden, the second commander of the 33rd Alabama During the Siege of Atlanta, members of the 33rd quickly learned that they were safer below ground than above it. At first they slept on the ground just behind their trenches, but with snipers and artillery wreaking havoc among them at night, they decided to stay in their ditch at all times.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 28. Perpendicular trenches were dug to grant access to their rear areas, while lights of any kind were banned at night. With no means of washing their clothes, the men suffered from insect infestations; their agony was compounded by a nearby Federal gun that managed to draw a transverse bead on their trench, doing considerable damage until Confederate counter-battery fire finally silenced it. The regiment was gradually moved to the left each day, digging new ditches in the red clay soil with bayonets, spades or picks, but never engaging the enemy. Jonesborough On the night of August 30, the 33rd Alabama was ordered to move to its left, with its troops collapsing from exhaustion every time the regiment stopped to rest. Arriving in the Atlanta suburb of Jonesborough on the morning of the 31st, the 33rd was fed into the line and permitted to rest for a time. In the afternoon they and the rest of Lowery's Brigade were ordered to charge the Federal works, where they managed to capture two steel cannon. They were quickly ambushed by dismounted Union cavalry commanded by Hugh Judson Kilpatrick and armed with Spencer Repeating Rifles; the brigade managed to drive them back, but were soon stopped by other Federal troops and returned to their lines.Bailey, Ronald H., and the Editors of Time-Life Books. Battles for Atlanta: Sherman Moves East. Alexandria, VA: Time-Life Books, 1985. , pg. 134.A map of the Jonesborough battlefield may be seen here . On September 1, Cleburne's division was attacked by elements of two Federal corps. Private Matthews reports that the Federals nearly broke their line, only to be driven back with the help of reinforcements from General Cheatham's division.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 29. These men were later withdrawn to bolster up another section of the line, however, leaving the 33rd to defend its sector with a single line of troops and no reserve. Further Federal attacks did not materialize; the Northerners were content to snipe at the 33rd throughout the rest of the day while their compatriots smashed through the Confederate line further north, leading the remnants to withdraw around nine that evening. Members of the regiment could see fires and hear explosions on the horizon, as Hood destroyed all of his supplies in Atlanta and evacuated the city.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 29. This conflagration forms a climatic moment in the 1939 M.G.M. Classic Gone With the Wind. The Alabamians linked up with an ambulance carrying their wounded and followed it to Lovejoy, Georgia, where they repulsed a Federal attack on the railroad there and got the first real night's sleep they had enjoyed in 122 days. Back to Tennessee The Franklin-Nashville Campaign Moving on After his defeat at Atlanta, General Hood regrouped his army at Lovejoy's Station, following which he moved to Palmetto, Georgia. Here the Army of Tennessee was reviewed by Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who had come to speak with Hood about his next move. Even after the debacle at Atlanta, Hood still retained a formidable force of 39,000 men,Eicher, David J. The Longest Night: A Military History of the Civil War. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2001. , pg. 769. and though Davis expressed disappointment in the way he had fought in Georgia and spoke of relieving him from command, he ultimately decided that Hood would keep his job. Davis did order Lieutenant General Hardee, the 33rd's longtime corps commander, to a new assignment, replacing him with Frank Cheatham. Hoping to draw Sherman away from Atlanta, Hood and Davis decided that the Army of Tennessee would move north toward Chattanooga, seeking to damage Federal supply lines and force Sherman to do battle on terrain favorable to the Confederates. By October 3, 1864, the Army of Tennessee had reached Kennesaw, site of their battle earlier that summer. So far, Hood's plan seemed to be working: Sherman had sent General Thomas back to Nashville to organize troops in that state, while sending another division under Brigadier General James Morgan to Chattanooga. Federal cavalry assigned to follow Hood's army lost track of him periodically and were only able to give an approximate picture of his movements. The 33rd camped near Lost Mountain on the third, on an old battlefield where the Confederate dead had been buried in shallow graves or simply left to rot. Private Matthews reported seeing decaying hands, feet or limbs protruding from the dirt, where dogs and other scavengers had dug up the graves to get at the rotting food in their haversacks. After spending a day reburying the exposed corpses, the 33rd moved on to Dallas and then to Cedartown, where one man in the regiment was killed in a freak accident after lightning struck a stack of rifles he was hanging his haversack on. Turning northeast toward Dalton, the regiment tore up railroad tracks along Sherman's supply line by heating the rails atop a fire made of railroad ties, then bending them. Men from the regiment were beginning to recognize old battlefields and campsites; on one night near Lafayette, the regiment even camped in the exact spot it had occupied just before the Battle of Chickamauga, the year before. With rations severely limited in the picked-over countryside, sorghum became even more popular than ever: soldiers would leave the marching column to gather armfuls of sugar cane for themselves and their friends or steal it from nearby farms at night; while their officers did not publicly sanction this behavior, they were known to eat their share after their troops had bivouacked for the evening. Home, sweet home General John Bell Hood, who commanded the Army of Tennessee at Atlanta and during the Franklin-Nashville Campaign Bypassing a strong Federal garrison at Resaca, Hood turned southwest and headed into Alabama, toward George Thomas' army headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. For the first time in the war the 33rd would be operating inside its native state, if only briefly. Sherman had turned back toward Atlanta, from whence he would begin his famed March to the Sea, after sending additional troops to help Thomas in Tennessee. Hood's plan was to drive north into Tennessee, defeat Thomas there, then move into Kentucky and thence east into Virginia, where Robert E. Lee was under siege at Petersburg. Seeking to link up with reinforcements under famed cavalry General Nathan Bedford Forrest, Hood moved west through northern Alabama to Florence, then north into Tennessee.Last Act In the West Spring Hill The Battle of Spring Hill. The 33rd Alabama was in Lowrey's Brigade At first, Generals Thomas and Sherman did not believe that Hood would actually invade Tennessee, with a Federal army about to burn its way through Georgia. However, as it became clear that this was Hood's destination, Thomas began to take action. Ordering Major General John M. Schofield to move to Columbia on the Duck River, Thomas hoped to intercept Hood before he could seize this important crossing. Hood split his army into three columns: the 33rd and the rest of Cheatham's Corps marched in the westernmost one through seventy miles of freezing rain, sleet and bitterly cold winds toward Mt. Pleasant, where the three columns reunited and continued in the direction of Columbia. Effectively screened by Forrest's cavalry, the Confederates reached Columbia just after the Federals had arrived and started to entrench. Bold maneuvers on the part of General Forrest, combined with artillery fire and effective demonstrations by the rest of Hood's army allowed them to cross the Duck River east of town, moving north toward Spring Hill--for once, the Army of Tennessee had been able to use the same tactic Sherman had used so well against them in Georgia. Amazingly, neither side reported any casualties in this encounter, which had consisted almost entirely of feints and shelling.The Union Army: Cyclopedia of Battles: Entry: \\"Columbia, Tenn, Nov. 24-28, 1864.\\" Having moved around Schofield's rapidly retreating force, Hood hoped to catch and destroy it near Spring Hill, to the north of Columbia. The Army of Tennessee moved rapidly along back-country roads and through fields and woods, with the men required to keep in ranks at all times while stragglers were dealt with severely.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 31‚Äì32. Forrest's cavalry arrived at the crossroads around 11:30 am on November 29; there they ran into elements of the Federal IV Corps, which had rushed ahead to hold the crossing until the rest of Schofield's army could arrive. Cleburne's division arrived in the afternoon just as Forrest's men were about to exhaust their ammunition. They immediately deployed for an attack, with the 33rd Alabama crossing a small stream and advancing around 4:00 pm with the rest of their division toward a Federal brigade under the command of Colonel Luther Prentice Bradley. Cleburne staggered his brigades in echelon formation, with Lowrey's Brigade on the far right. Lowrey's men engaged first, with the 33rd advancing \\"across a slope and across a field, [driving] the Federals from behind some rail defenses, then on up and around ... a horse lot rail fence, barn and dwelling where we were making a stand ... we followed them down a slope, where we halted and reformed the line.\\" With Cleburne personally leading Govan's Arkansas Brigade in support, his division soon routed the Federals and advanced toward Schofield's line of march on the Columbia Pike. Here they were stopped cold by Federal artillery; as darkness fell, the entire Confederate attack ground to a halt. Although Hood planned to attack Schofield's approaching army in the morning, the Federals slipped by him in the darkness while he and his men slept, moving on to the nearby town of Franklin. Here the 33rd and the rest of Hood's army were about to experience their worst day of the war. Franklin Cleburne's assault at the Battle of Franklin. The 33rd Alabama attacked with the rest of Lowrey's Brigade on the right flank of Cleburne's division, which attacked just to the right of the Columbia Pike at the center of the image The battlefield at Franklin, from an etching made about 20 years after the war. The Federals were entrenched on the far side of this field On November 30, 1864, General Hood awoke to learn that Schofield's army had slipped by him during the night and was now safely entrenched in Franklin, to the north. Enraged at this unexpected development, Hood angrily blamed his subordinates-- especially Cheatham--for letting the Federals escape.Thomas R. Cartwright, Franklin: The Valley of Death Determined to stop Schofield from uniting with Thomas' main force at Nashville, Hood resolved to attack him head-on at Franklin, even though the Federals were now behind formidable fortifications (built for a previous battle fought there the year before). These included breastworks six-to-eight feet high fronted by four-foot wide ditches, and thorny obstructions using branches from Osage Orange trees in the area. Although Hood had roughly 39,000 men, only 27,000 would make the attack; this placed them at even odds with the Federals, who had the same number of men.Eicher, David J. The Longest Night: A Military History of the Civil War. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2001. , pg. 774. Hood's army began to arrive at Franklin around 1:00 pm, with the infantry far outpacing their artillery and other support personnel. Rather than wait for his guns to come up, Hood ordered an immediate assault, as the sun would be setting in just over three and a half hours and he did not want Schofield to get away again. Cleburne, Cheatham and Forrest all protested Hood's plan, but their commander remained determined. So, bereft of artillery support, Cleburne now prepared to lead his division across two miles of open field toward the very center of the Federal line. When General Govan said that few of them would live to see the end of this day, a visibly depressed Cleburne replied: \\"Well Govan, if we are to die, let us die like men.\\" During the attack at Franklin, Lowrey's Brigade formed a second line in Cleburne's division, behind the brigades of Govan and Granbury.What Lowrey's Brigade Faced at the Battle of Franklin, From Soldiers' Views, statement of Private Andrew Jackson Batchelor, Co. K, 33rd Alabama Regiment. Moving through savage cannon fire toward the Carter House Cotton Gin across the field, the 33rd halted briefly with their sister regiments to fix bayonets, having been ordered not to shoot until they reached the Federal trenches. Then screaming their famous \\"rebel yell\\" they charged headlong into the breastworks, held in this sector by the 100th and 104th Ohio Infantry regiments, the 6th Ohio Battery and Battery A of the 1st Kentucky. Behind them stood the 16th Kentucky, the 12th Kentucky, the 8th Tennessee (Union) Infantry, and Battery \\"A\\" of the 1st Ohio Battery. Behind them was the 175th Ohio Infantry.See Franklin Battle 1630. Two privates of the 33rd left accounts of what happened next. Private Matthews records: Private Andrew Jackson Batchelor, of Company K, gives this account: Savage fighting ensued as Cleburne's Confederates briefly penetrated the inner Federal defenses near the cotton gin; Federal soldiers wrote of desperately trying to stop the onrushing tide not just with rifles, but with axes, hatchets, and \\"anything that came into hand.\\"What Lowrey's Brigade Faced at the Battle of Franklin, From Soldiers' Views, statement of Private Nelson A. Pinney, Co. D, 104th Ohio Regiment. Cleburne was killed fifty yards from the breastworks, after having two horses shot out from under him and running the rest of the way on foot, sword in one hand and his kepi hat in the other. In his autobiography, written two years after the war, General Lowrey recalled his brigade's performance at Franklin: The Carter House cotton gin at Franklin The final charge of Patrick Cleburne and his men at Franklin has been featured in Civil War art. Some examples of this include portraits by Dale Gallon, Don Troiani and Mort Kunstler. Of his one-time subordinate, the Irish doctor's son who had risen from a British corporal to a Southern Major General and then to immortality, General Hardee observed: \\"Where this division defended, no odds broke its line; where it attacked, no numbers resisted its onslaught, save only once; and there is the grave of Cleburne.\\"Shelby Foote, The Civil War: A Narrative. Vol. 3, Red River to Appomattox. New York: Random House, 1974. , pg. 671. The modern Irish band \\"Sons of Erin\\" released a tribute to Patrick Cleburne; it may be heard here A Tribute To Patrick R. Cleburne - YouTube. By the time the smoke cleared at Franklin, the Army of Tennessee had suffered a cataclysmic defeat: it had lost 6,252 men in just a couple of hours, including six dead generals, six wounded, and one captured.Jacobson, Eric A., and Richard A. Rupp. For Cause & for Country: A Study of the Affair at Spring Hill and the Battle of Franklin. Franklin, TN: O'More Publishing, 2007. ., pp. 418‚Äì20. In addition, 55 of Hood's regimental commanders became casualties--an appalling loss of mid-level commanders in an army that had lost many, already.John Chandler Griffin, A Pictorial History of the Confederacy, pg. 193. The 33rd Alabama lost two-thirds of its original 285 men; the remnant could no longer function as an independent fighting unit, so they were consolidated with survivors from the 16th and 45th Alabama regiments in a single formation, though the regimental designations were not rescinded. Nashville Federal soldiers on the front line at Nashville on December 16, on the morning of the battle's second day The Battle of Nashville, death knell for the Army of Tennessee Incredibly, even after his debacle at Franklin, General Hood insisted on continuing his march toward Nashville. He seems to have been motivated more by a desire to prevent his army from disintegrating through desertion than by any thought that he stood a chance of victory, now that Thomas had 71,842 men to his 23,053. Federal engineers had been fortifying the city for over two years;McDonough, James Lee. Nashville: The Western Confederacy's Final Gamble. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2004. , pp. 132‚Äì33. in addition to seven miles of trench lines and fortifications, a powerful fleet of Union ironclads on the Cumberland River offered additional firepower while protecting the city from amphibious assault. Hood arrived at Nashville on December 2 and set to work constructing his own line of fortifications, hoping that Thomas would emerge from behind his own breastworks and attack him under unfavorable conditions.McPherson, James M., ed. Battle Chronicles of the Civil War: 1864. Connecticut: Grey Castle Press, 1989. . First published in 1989 by McMillan. pg. 194. Cheatham's corps, including the badly depleted 33rd Alabama, manned the right section of Hood's line. Lowrey's Brigade held the extreme right flank, which ended at a deep railroad cut belonging to the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad.Statement of Brig. Gen. James A. Smith, Brigade Commander in Cleburne's Division . Smith assumed command of the division after Cleburne's death; his brigade had been absent at Franklin, having been detailed for escort duty in Alabama during the battle. A bitter ice storm began on December 8 and subzero temperatures persisted through December 12, further complicating the Southerners' misery.Sword, Wiley. The Confederacy's Last Hurrah: Spring Hill, Franklin, and Nashville. Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1993. . First published with the title Embrace an Angry Wind in 1992 by HarperCollins, pp. 302‚Äì03. Hood did not have to wait long for his nemesis to appear: once the weather abated, Thomas emerged from his fortifications on December 15, and hit Hood's army. The 33rd Alabama was engaged with the rest of Lowrey's Brigade by a brigade of United States Colored Troops and another one composed of men described by their own commander as \\"new conscripts, convalescents and bounty jumpers.\\"Sword, Wiley. The Confederacy's Last Hurrah: Spring Hill, Franklin, and Nashville. Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1993. . First published with the title Embrace an Angry Wind in 1992 by HarperCollins, pp. 325. Intended to divert Hood's attention from the main attack intended for his left flank, this assault was beaten back, though the Federals continued to fire at the Alabamians and their friends over the course of the day. The Federal attack smashed Hood's left, and he was compelled to retreat to a new and more compact line, some distance to the rear of his original line.B. Franklin Cooling, Ph.D, The Decisive Battle of Nashville. The following morning found the 33rd Alabama with the rest of Cheatham's Division on the Confederate left flank, near a road called the Granny White Pike.The Official and Statistical Register for the State of Mississippi, pg. 581. This section of the front was hit late in the day by a three-brigade attack led by Federal Brigadier General John McArthur, which smashed through the poorly placed defenses and rolled up Hood's line from west to east as additional Union forces joined the assault. Hood's army rapidly disintegrated, with its shattered remnants fleeing down the Granny White Pike and nearby roads to Columbia, not ultimately stopping until they reached Tupelo, Mississippi, 220 miles away.Jacob Cox, LL.D., Major General: Battle of Nashville. An explanatory map detailing the different phases of the Battle of Nashville, including positions held by Cheatham's corps on both days, may be seen here: . Already decimated by its fruitless assault at Franklin, the once-proud Army of Tennessee was all but obliterated at Nashville. Having taken 39,000 men with him into Tennessee the month before, Hood came out with 18,742. His own career irreparably ruined, Hood resigned his position and would not receive another command for the duration of the war. Private Matthews reports that on the day after the battle, \\"we that could stand were given two or three pounds of flour and a pound or two of beef, and told to get South.\\" The Carolina Campaign=Picking up the pieces Following the disaster at Nashville, the few remaining members of the 33rd Alabama withdrew with the rest of their shattered army, first to Columbia, then further south to Decatur, Alabama, and thence to Tupelo. Morale had sunk to an all-time low, with many of the survivors believing they had been \\"unfortunately handled.\\" In January 1865 the regiment drew shoes and marched from Tupelo to West Point, Mississippi, where they boarded a train that took them first to Meridian and then to Demopolis, Alabama. Here they were forced to sleep in the mud along the tracks, because they could find no branches to make ridge-poles for their tents. On the way to Selma the following day, their train derailed in an eerie repeat of the episode in late 1862; several men from Companies B and G were sitting on top of the cars, and were injured when their boxcars left the tracks. The men dusted themselves off and resumed their journey, arriving in Selma the next day, where they boarded steamboats and proceeded to Montgomery. Carolina Bennett Place, where the 33rd Alabama and the rest of Johnston's Army surrendered to General William T. Sherman, effectively ending the U.S. Civil War Following a 10-day furlough in February 1865, the last remnant of the 33rd Alabama--many bereft of weapons or basic equipment--boarded trains to Augusta, Georgia, where they were brigaded and ordered to march to Rock Hill, South Carolina, where they boarded another train for Smithfield, North Carolina. Here their final assignment awaited them, in Joseph Johnston's newly formed Army of the South. The regiment participated at the three-day Battle of Bentonville on March 19‚Äì21, 1865, not arriving on the battlefield until the final day when the contest was already lost. On April 8 they, along with the 16th and 45th Alabama, were consolidated with the 17th Alabama; this remnant was surrendered to General Sherman with the rest of Johnston's army at Bennett Place near Durham eighteen days later. Sherman issued ten day's rations to his former enemies, then released them to return to their homes.General Joseph E. Johnston On his way back to Alabama, Private Matthews reported that Federal soldiers assigned to guard the trains took pleasure in shooting at livestock from the moving boxcars. On one occasion near Dawson, Georgia, one such Yankee saw a woman plowing with an ox about a quarter-mile from the train; he shot it dead, and Matthews recorded that \\"had we men aboard protested, they would have shot us.\\" The regimental survivors returned to their homes in southeastern Alabama, where some resumed their lives while others eventually relocated to different counties and states.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 33‚Äì43. Regimental commanders, weapons and equipment=Commander and other field officers 1859 map of Alabama. The 33rd Alabama was recruited mostly from counties in the southeastern portion of the state Colonel Samuel Adams, first Commander of the 33rd Alabama The first regimental commander of the 33rd Alabama was Colonel Samuel Adams, born in 1829 in Abbeville, South Carolina. Educated at South Carolina College (from which he graduated in 1850), he relocated to Greenville, Alabama, where he served as principal of an academy there.Colonel Sam Adams He spent his spare time reading Law, and was admitted to the Alabama Bar in 1852. He married Dora Herbert, and soon embarked on a political career, being elected to the U.S House of Representatives from the Whig Party in 1857 and 1859. Adams initially enlisted in the 9th Alabama Infantry in 1861, where he was elected First Lieutenant of his company and served in the Confederate Army of the Potomac, the antecedent of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Released in February 1862 to recruit men in his home state, he was chosen to command the newly formed 33rd Alabama. Adams was wounded in the foot at Perryville while leading a brigade; after returning to regimental command in 1864, he was awaiting a recommended promotion to Brigadier General when he was mortally wounded by a Federal sharpshooter at the Battle of Atlanta.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 27. After Perryville Adams was replaced by Colonel Robert Crittenden of Coffee County, who was captured at Nashville.Alabama Archives and History: 33rd Alabama Regiment Other regimental officers included: Isaac Corn, James Dunklin, John Crosby, A.N. Moore and Willis Milner. Adams and Moore were killed in battle, Crosby died of natural causes, Dunklin was wounded, and Crittenden was captured. Regimental flag The first regimental flag of the 33rd Alabama was described as: \\"blue, with a white crescent moon near the center, trimmed with a two-inch white border;\\" later versions incorporated the regimental number and battles in which it had participated.A photo of the 1864 version of this banner may be seen here While in service under General Cleburne, the 33rd did not carry the Confederate battle flag as most units did; instead, Cleburne-- who openly encouraged competitiveness among the units in his division-- directed them to carry their own distinctive banners, which they were instructed to \\"make respected\\" not merely by their enemies, but by their compatriots as well.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 30. Cleburne's division especially nursed a rivalry with the division led by Major General Benjamin F. Cheatham; the two often fought side-by-side, and while good-natured competitiveness ran high between them, so did mutual camaraderie and trust. The colors of the 33rd Alabama were captured at Franklin by Captain J.H. Brown of Company D, 12th Kentucky Infantry Regiment. Unlike other captured Confederate flags, which were displayed for decades in Northern public places or elsewhere, the flag of the 33rd vanished soon after being given the designation \\"Flag No. 245\\" in 1865.Flag of the 33rd Alabama, Alabama Department of Archives and History. In 1940, it was rediscovered by accident at an estate sale in Melrose, Massachusetts. Citizens of the town joined with local public figures to purchase the flag, which was presented to the Governor of Alabama during a special ceremony in September of that year. The flag was given to the state archives, where it has been treated to aid in its preservation, and is now on exhibit in their museum. A replacement for the captured regimental standard was made soon after its loss at Franklin; this was described as a \\"Hardee-pattern battle flag with no numbers, words or battle honors.\\"The Confederate Surrender at Greensboro: The Final Days of the Army of Tennessee This banner was kept by Captain Needham Hughes of Co. I, who was acting as the 33rd's brigade commander at the close of the war. He slipped out of the regiment's camp just after the capitulation and wrapped the flag around himself, under his uniform, to prevent it from being turned over to the Union authorities as a trophy of war.Unsurrendered Confederate Flag Hughes took it home, and it has been in his family ever since. Uniforms W.E. Matthews, a Private in the 33rd Alabama's Company B, left an extremely detailed description of the equipment issued to his regiment by Confederate and state authorities. According to him, their initial clothing issue was as follows: Later, in October 1862, the regiment drew new uniforms upon their return to Knoxville, Tennessee, after the disastrous Kentucky Campaign. Matthews describes: \\"woolen gray jeans, jacket lined with white cotton sheathing with four C.S.A. brass buttons, a pair of unlined gray jeans pants, a while cotton sheeting shirt and drawers, and white cotton machine-knit [word unintelligible] socks and pair of rough tan brogans, hand-made wooden peg shoes ... Most, or all of us, had been using finger-knit woolen socks, which were sent to us from home.\\"W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 13. By 1863, with clothing supplies harder to come by, men from the regiment were dressing in \\"home-woven gray blue, brown or black woolen jeans pants or overcoats ... homemade lamb's wool or beaver or coonskin fur hats ... gray or black hats ... the majority of us wore wool socks sent us from home, while others wore the entire regulation gray uniform including gray caps.\\"W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 15. Matthews reports that \\"there were a class of men among us who would rob the dead ... [Other] men who did not entertain the thought of taking the shoes off the dead themselves, but who were in need of shoes and did not know where they could get any, would pay from $10 to $25 for a pair of second-hand shoes to the man who said, usually, that he had bought them and that they did not fit.\\"W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 16. Some became so desperate by 1863 that they resorted to scrounging old shoes from abandoned campsites that had been exposed to the elements for six months or more. These were initially soaked in water and then worn; some men had to wear two completely different sized shoes, one for each foot.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 19. Weapons and equipment Private Matthews describes the first rifles issued to the regiment: These rifles were later replaced by Enfields, which were in turn subsequently discarded for captured Federal Springfield rifles, which were seen as more dependable.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 15‚Äì16. Writing about knapsacks, canteens and other gear issued during their initial deployment to Ft. McRee, Matthews described: Other equipment later assigned to the regiment included: \\"wall tents with a fly for each, a two-mule covered ambulance with team, other two-mule teams and white canvas-covered wagons to carry our tents, cooking utensils, axes, picks, spades and other such things.\\"W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History., page 7. The regiment lost its wall tents at Wartrace, Tennessee, in April 1863; thereafter, the men made do with captured Federal shelter halves, three of which were often combined to form a usable shelter.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History., page 19. By the winter of 1863‚Äì64, supply shortages in the South had become acute: new recruits were arriving each month from Alabama without much more than the civilian clothes they were wearing, a \\"Confederate tin canteen and white cotton cloth haversack, [and a] home-woven wool blanket or cotton bed quilt.\\" These soldiers were quick to exchange those things for \\"a Yankee U.S. blanket, an oilcloth haversack and cloth-covered canteen,\\" usually by removing them from the battlefield.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History., page 25. Rations Rations issued to the men of the 33rd varied, depending on the time and location. Speaking of the regiment's fare during their early days at Ft. McRee, Matthews writes: Hardtack from the Civil War By the time the regiment reached Corinth, Mississippi, in early 1862, the 33rd was keeping \\"three days cooked rations in our haversacks of flour or cornbread, crackers, rice, pickled pork, fresh or pickled beef, salt, syrup, sweet potatoes, and drew some soap once a week.\\"W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 8. \\"Cattle, hogs, sheep or goats,\\" said Matthews, \\"were either driven or shipped to us on [railroad] cars, and usually butchered on the banks of a creek into which the offal was dumped.\\" He writes of men wrapping fish they had caught in green leaves, then roasting them in the ashes of their campfires, together with sweet potatoes. In Tullahoma, Tennessee, in early 1863, regimental rations now consisted largely of fresh pork; after the hogs had been butchered, their intestines would be left for any soldiers who wished to make chitterlings out of them.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History., page 16. Salt (which Matthews says was carried in \\"small cloth wallets in our haversacks\\") and coffee were highly prized, with \\"ghouls\\" even taking them from the dead. He also mentions \\"flour, corn meal, rice, some fresh beef, some sweet and Irish potatoes ... and soap\\" being issued at this time. By April 1863, rations consisted of \\"three-fourths pounds of flour, or corn meal, or rice; meat rations: usually three-fourths pounds grass-fed common beef or a half pound of bacon; and salt, occasionally ...\\" Soldiers supplemented this through foraging,W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History., page 20. and while rations were plentiful enough at this point to ignore a dead yearling bull they found on one of their marches, Matthews indicates that \\"a dead yearling, nor a live one for that matter, would not have remained unskinned long near us a month later.\\" By the start of the Atlanta Campaign, the beef issued to the regiment was of such an inferior quality that \\"some of the boys said they had to walk across their pen twice to make a shadow.\\" Civil War regimental commissary While in the field, rations for the 33rd (and other Confederate regiments) were usually cooked at a site located two to five miles in the rear area behind the front lines, where the \\"regimental skillet wagon\\" was located.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History., page 26. Men were periodically assigned to KP duty here, where they chopped wood, carried water and cooked meals. A regimental teamster was assigned to draw rations daily from the nearest railhead; in May 1864 these consisted of one pound of unbolted corn per man per day, or the same weight of flour made of wheat and cowpeas ground together. In addition, each soldier was allotted a half-pound of bacon, or a pound of fresh beef. When this arrangement proved impractical (such as during combat), uncooked rations were issued, and each soldier was on their own. Unlike modern armies who employ trained cooks, the 33rd made do with troops from the ranks; the quality of their preparations accordingly varied, with Matthews reporting of one cook: \\"Co. B didn't make [him] any presents.\\"W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History., page 27. During their ill-fated Franklin-Nashville Campaign in late 1864 regimental rations had dwindled to near nothing, with troops forced to scavenge sorghum from farms;W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 31. one Mess Sergeant was even jokingly advised to throw away his scales, since the men believed that no more rations would ever be issued and the man should not have to haul the unnecessary weight. Local farmers had fled the area, leaving their fields unplanted and their stock scattered or dead. While cornbread, biscuits and beef were occasionally issued in minute quantities, persimmons were often the only food the 33rd got to eat on a regular basis. When he was wounded at Franklin, Matthews was transferred to a Confederate hospital at Columbia, Tennessee, where he was fed \\"beef soup, wheat and corn bread, fresh beef often hashed, pork and bacon, Irish potatoes and onions.\\"W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 32. On their final journey from Mississippi to North Carolina in early 1865, the 33rd drew two-days' worth of rations described as: \\"three-fourths pound of corn meal and a half pound of flour, and three-fourths pound beef and one-third pound of bacon,\\" plus sweet potatoes.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 33. During the final fifteen months of the war, Matthews reports, \\"we were not accustomed to [having] as much as we could eat, in consequence of which our stomachs became drawn and contracted; and for two years or more after we got home, we could not eat as much as we could before we entered the army.\\"W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History., page 24. Sundries 2LT James Moore Fleming, of Company K, 33rd Alabama Infantry, from Elba, Alabama Various sundries were available at different times to men of the 33rd. At Ft. McRee soldiers could purchase: \\"a small horn fine-tooth comb, a horn folding pocket comb, a fourth quire of common writing paper, or about twenty-four unstamped envelopes [all of which] cost about twenty-five cents each; and fifty cents for a brass penstaff and steel pen point, or a wood-and-glass inkwell; postage stamps were ten cents each ...\\" During Christmas of 1862, Matthews writes that matches were at a premium among his friends: \\"a round wooden box, containing one hundred sulphur matches, and [having] to be quite dry to ignite, [cost] a month's wages at $11.00.\\" Some men carried flint rocks or arrowheads, which they would scrape against their pocketknives to start fires even when it was raining. Other soldiers would gather around \\"in droves\\" with twigs, bark and other kindling to ignite and carry back to start their own blazes. By April 1863, groundpeas retailed at 25 cents per \\"short tin quart;\\" stick candy was five cents per stick or $3.50 for a five-pound bundle; coffee was $5 per pound, and corn whiskey sold at varying prices, depending on availability. A local farmer who had received supplies from a Blockade runner might sell it for $1.00 per quart, or twenty-five cents per glass--usually only to those who belonged to a club.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 18. During the Siege of Chattanooga, Matthews says that liver could be bought at 75 cents per pound; a cow's head cost 50 cents to a dollar per pound, while the tongue cost 75 cents to a dollar.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History., page 22. A dollar could also buy a short pint of cowpeas, salt or rice. For a short time the regiment had the services of some women who sold a \\"very small hot biscuit, without yeast or shortening, and with very little salt in them\\" for a dollar, as well.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 22. Two men in the regiment specialized in baking cakes of flour, black sorghum syrup and a little salt, which were sold by sutlers during the regiment's time at Atlanta.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 24. These fetched a dollar apiece, or ten for $9.00, or $66.65 per hundred. Purchasers learned not to eat these while marching, as two men who did were later sent to the rear in an ambulance. Discipline Military justice during the U.S. Civil War was often administered with great severity. Members of the 33rd Alabama, like those of other units on both sides, were compelled at different times to witness punishments meted out to convicted offenders; Matthews describes this episode from the regiment's time in Corinth: Equally draconian was the practice of \\"drumming a man out of service:\\" Soldiers wearing the \\"barrel shirt.\\" On another occasion, regimental soldiers were called out to witness the executions of two men: one had deserted, and the other was convicted of raping women. On this occasion, however, a last-minute reprieve from the army commander stopped both executions.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 10. Discipline within the 33rd Alabama was lenient, compared to this. Most minor offenses were dealt with initially by a warning; if the conduct persisted, the offender might be given extra \\"police duty,\\" which would entail sweeping, cleaning his living area, digging or cleaning out latrine or offal pits or similar activities during off-duty hours. The worst punishment usually meted out for all but the most serious of offenses was to be confined to the guard quarters while performing extra duty; however, Matthews indicates that those so confined were often helped in doing their punishment work by comrades who felt sorry for them. The worst punishments inflicted on anyone in the 33rd were \\"bucking and gagging,\\" the wearing of a \\"barrel shirt,\\" or carrying a rail while marching. According to Matthews, this was done to just one man‚Äîand that by the army's provost marshal, not any regimental authority. Sanitation Field hygiene and sanitation are extremely important in the prevention of disease, which was responsible for two-thirds of the deaths suffered during the Civil War.Jeffrey Sartin, M.D., Civil War Medicine: The Toll of Bullets and Bacteria , abstract. Private Matthews describes some of the sanitary measures taken during the 33rd's time in Tupelo: Matthews reports that when a member of Company B accidentally dropped his pocketwatch into the latrine pit one morning, he paid a black cook $5.00 to get it out. Men from the regiment stripped and washed their socks, underwear and shirts in a creek without using soap or boiling water; then they put on dry socks, pants, coats and shoes while waiting for their wet clothes to dry in the sun--unless they were ordered to move out, in which case they simply put on their sopping clothes and let them dry on their bodies.W.E. Mathews Preston Diary and Regimental History, SPR393, Alabama Dept. of Archives and History, page 11. Men tried to bathe their feet at least once every twenty-four hours, striving to always keep a pair of dry socks to keep their feet from becoming \\"sore.\\" Half-ripe walnuts and fruit were forbidden for sanitary reasons, and soldiers caught eating them were punished by being forced to dig latrine pits. Mail and packages Often food and clothing would be sent to the regiment from families back home, in care of a soldier returning from furlough. Private Matthews writes that such a man would have to remain with them on the boxcars even after his leave had expired, to prevent them from being stolen. One such man was AWOL for two weeks while keeping an eye on some boxes shipped by families of soldiers from Eufaula, but when he was finally able to obtain transportation for himself and his cargo to the regiment, he was absolved of all charges and nothing further was said. Regimental nicknames Giving nicknames to soldiers has long been a feature of military life. Private David McCook of Company B was referred to as the \\"Skillet Wagon\\" by men of other companies, because they were always borrowing his tin pans, buckets or cans for cooking. Private Matthews was called \\"Marker\\", while others sported such monikers as \\"Burnt Tail Coat\\", \\"Fatty Bread\\", \\"Mumps\\", \\"Lousy Jim\\", \\"Cakes\\", \\"Keno\\", \\"Strap\\" and \\"Sharp.\\" Matthews further reports that one evening as the regiment was being inspected by its commander, Colonel Adams called a twenty- year-old recruit to attention, referring to him \\"by a name that he would not have given a married man\\"; he writes that this name stuck with that man afterward, and was used by the regimental surgeon to warn malingerers away from sick call. Roll of Honor Ten soldiers of the 33rd Alabama were inscribed into the Confederate Roll of Honor during the civil war, all for the Battle of Chickamauga:33rd Alabama: Roll of Honor * CPL Bell, Alexander R., Company \\"H\\"; * 3SG Bush, Richard R., Company \\"G\\"; (KIA) * CPT Dodson, W.E., Company \\"C\\"; * CPT Hammett, B.F., Company \\"B\\"; * PVT Harris, William, Company \\"K\\"; * PVT Hatten, W.E., Company \\"I\\"; * PVT Lewis, P.S.H., Company \\"E\\"; (KIA) * PVT Mock, W.R., Company \\"A\\"; * PVT Perry, J.D., Company \\"C\\"; * SGT Sessions, C.L., Company \\"D\\".

Re-enactment groups 33rd Alabama Infantry ‚Äì Modern re-enactment group. See also *List of Alabama Civil War Confederate units *15th Regiment Alabama Infantry ‚Äì Another Confederate regiment recruited earlier in the war from this same area; it went on to fame during the Battle of Gettysburg as the regiment that charged the 20th Maine on Little Round Top. Footnotes * Although one source gives this soldier's name as \\"Marvin L. Wheeler\\", of Co. A, the Alabama Department of Archives and History lists the author's name as \\"W.E. Matthews\\" or \\"W.E. Matthews Preston,\\" while the National Park Service lists it as \\"W.E. Preston.\\" Another document indicates that he was \\"William E. Matthews\\" during the war, but later changed his name to \\"Preston.\\" See Dale County Military Archives. * Matthew's low opinion of Bragg was shared by another private in the Army of Tennessee, Sam Watkins (of the 1st Tennessee Infantry), who wrote the famous memoir Company Aytch. See Chapter III, \\"Corinth,\\" where he describes in detail the contempt he had for Bragg--an opinion shared by most of Bragg's senior officers--see also Chapter IV, \\"Tupelo,\\" Chapter VII, \\"Shelbyville,\\" and especially Chapter XI, \\"Dalton,\\" in which he compares Bragg to his eventual replacement, General Joseph E. Johnston, insisting that in his opinion, the latter was just in his punishments, while the former was not. * Apparently unbeknownst to Matthews, General Wood had been wounded in the head during the battle; see Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands, Stanford University Press, 2001, , pg. 579. Wood would recover and return to command; he survived the war and served as an Alabama state legislator, attorney and professor of law at the University of Alabama before dying in 1891. * According to Private Matthews (pg. 13 of his manuscript), several soldiers of the 33rd were absent from the unit during the Battle of Perryville; many of these rejoined the regiment from Confederate military hospitals further south, after the retreat to Tennessee. * A common practice among slave-holding soldiers in the Confederate Army (especially early in the war) was to take a slave they considered especially loyal with them to the Army; these men were referred to as \\"body servants\\". While their duties were usually much less onerous than the slaves left behind at home, these men were still legally their masters' property. * \\"Bucking and gagging\\" refers to the practice of sitting a soldier on the ground, gagging him, then tying his arms and legs together, knees between his arms and a rod or stick inserted over his elbows and under his knees. A \\"barrel shirt\\" refers to a barrel that had holes for the soldier's arms, which he wore to indicate that he had committed some offense. * Lieutenant Moore was the regimental adjutant, and the author of the letter cited earlier in this article describing the Battle of Stones River (see note 97). Of him, Matthews indicates that \\"it was not supposed that Adjutant Moore had an enemy in the regiment, he not having trouble with anyone; furthermore, he was probably the best liked of all our regimental officers.\\" (page 20) Apparently Moore's death was treated as an accident, though its perpetrator was \\"scolded ... with an exhibition of feeling that was quite plain.\\" (page 20) * A series of five maps depicting the action in the Winfrey Field and nearby woods from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm may be viewed here Civil War Virtual Tours Chickamauga September 19th Winfrey Field 6:00 PM.

Flags were very important during the Civil War, not just because they helped one find one's own regiment in the confusion of combat, but also in part because they symbolized the honor, history and prowess of the regiment to which they belonged. See Why Were Flags Enormously Important in the Civil War? for further explanation. * Eleven months before his death, General Cleburne had made an astonishing proposal to the Confederate government: he advocated that the South free all of its slaves, then arm and train the males as soldiers to fight alongside whites for a truly free Confederacy. Although it seems to have stemmed more from military necessity than from any moral opposition to slavery (though he refers to it as a \\"continued embarrassment\\" and an \\"insidious weakness\\"), his proposal details the various reasons given by other Southerners for wanting to preserve the institution. Cleburne's letter was scorned by his associates and suppressed by Jefferson Davis; some historians believe it cost him any chance for a future promotion. For the text of this extraordinary letter, see Patrick Cleburne's Proposal to Arm Slaves. Cleburne's idea forms the theme of the 2008 graphic novel Cleburne, by Justin Murphy.

At the time of his death, his mother, Ana Cacho, and two sisters were at the house. The case has gained notoriety in the island for the discrepancies and irregularities surrounding the evidence and testimonies about it, which initially led to the boy's mother along with three males to be labeled potential suspects by the island's Secretary of Justice at the time Guillermo Somoza. However, on March 9, 2015, on the 5th anniversary of the murder, the Puerto Rico Justice Department announced that the mother along with the three men, were no longer suspects. The Department of Justice confirmed on March 7, 2016 that charges be filed for the crime of first degree murder against Luis Gustavo Rivera Seijo, better known as \\"El Manco\\", for the child's death. On April 28, 2016 charges against Rivera Seijo were dropped due to total lack of evidence (DNA, fingerprints, etc.) that could prove the presence of Rivera Seijo in Cacho's residence. On June 7, 2016, in a trial on appeal, the charges against Rivera Seijo were dropped again due to total lack of evidence (DNA, fingerprints, etc.) that could prove the presence of Rivera Seijo in Cacho's residence. Background Lorenzo Gonz√°lez Cacho was born on November 29, 2001. He was the middle child of Ahmed Al√≠ Gonz√°lez and Ana Cacho out of three. The couple also had two daughters. From an early age, Gonz√°lez showed interest in sports, and was active in a soccer team. He was studying at Dorado Academy in his hometown. At the time of Lorenzo's death, his parents were in the process of divorcing. Also, at that time, his sisters were approximately 13 and 5 years old. Death On March 9, 2010, Ana Cacho took Lorenzo to the Treatment and Diagnostic Center in Dorado, Puerto Rico. Cacho arrived between 5:00 and 5:30 am with Lorenzo covered in blood. The child was pronounced dead at the clinic. Upon questioning, Cacho claimed that her son had fallen from his bed at their home in Dorado del Mar. However, this version was discarded by the autopsy which revealed severe injuries to the face and head, which included three stabbing wounds to the face. Suspects Although no charges have been filed, the Puerto Rico Department of Justice had identified four people considered suspects in the death of Lorenzo. However, on March 9, 2015, on the 5th anniversary of the murder, the Puerto Rico Department of Justice announced that all four were no longer suspects. *Ana Cacho ‚Äì Lorenzo's mother. She was identified as a suspect by the Department of Justice on March 19, 2010. Her two daughters were also removed from her home on March 30, 2010 and they haven't had contact since. Through the process, Cacho has insisted that she is innocent. On March 9, 2015, on the 5th anniversary of the murder, the Puerto Rico Department of Justice announced that she was no longer a suspect. *Jes√∫s Jenaro Camacho ‚Äì Cacho's boyfriend at the moment of the murder. He was identified as a suspect on October 26, 2011. He denies being in the house when the incident occurred. He has also maintained that he is innocent. On March 9, 2015, on the 5th anniversary of the murder, the Puerto Rico Department of Justice announced that he was no longer a suspect. *Arnaldo \\"Naldy\\" Col√≥n ‚Äì A friend of Cacho. It has been rumored he was at the house the night of the murder. On March 9, 2015, on the 5th anniversary of the murder, the Puerto Rico Department of Justice announced that he was no longer a suspect. *William Marrero ‚Äì Federal agent working for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). He was identified as a suspect in August 2012 by the authorities. Allegedly he was also present in Cacho's house the night of the murder. On March 9, 2015, on the 5th anniversary of the murder, the Puerto Rico Department of Justice announced that he was no longer a suspect. *Luis Gustavo Rivera Seijo ‚Äì better known as \\"El Manco\\", a homeless man missing his left forearm, who grew up in the same neighborhood and was incorrectly released from jail the night of the murder was also previously identified as a suspect, allegedly Rivera Seijo confessed to the crime but the authorities discarded his involvement due to lack of evidence confirming his admission. He was previously diagnosed with a mental disorder. On March 8, 2016 the Judge Jessica Morales, determined probable cause for arrest for murder against Luis Gustavo Rivera Seijo aka \\"El Manco\\" for Lorenzo Gonz√°lez Cacho's death. Charges of Negligence, justice obstruction and suspicion of murder for the previously accused had been retired due to a total lack of forensic evidence to even confirm the presence of Rivera Seijo at the crime scene. Controversy The case gained widespread notoriety throughout the island when the gossip-news show SuperXclusivo, started following it closely. While following the case, a number of irregularities were alleged. Among these is the crime scene, which was not secured and was cleaned after it had already been seen by investigators, but before forensics could thoroughly analyze it. Ana Cacho's father met with the governor at the time, Luis Fortu√±o, and handed him a mysterious envelope. The secretary of Justice at the time, Antonio Sagard√≠a, resigned to his post and became Ana Cacho's lawyer, and expressed that she was a victim of the media, although this was seen as unethical by many. Of the other three previous suspects, only Jenaro Camacho has given a public interview. \\"El Manco\\" who was accused of the murder in March 2016, was shown to have been diagnosed with mental problems. He had confessed at the beginning of the investigation and several other times, sometimes retracting his confessions. His confessions weren't considered valid at first, because according to authorities they didn't add up and the claimed murder weapon was never found. Some believe him to have confessed because he prefers jail to being homeless. On April 28, 2016 another Judge explained the confession was full of errors and that there is no evidence (DNA, fingerprints, etc.) that could prove the presence of \\"El Manco\\" in Cacho's residence.

The museum tells a number of stories pertaining to all aspects of Florida‚Äôs maritime history. Exhibits include historic photographs, boat models, tools, instruments, and other historic artifacts. The museum also features a large collection of shells from the Gulf of Mexico. The museum is also home to a folk school that teaches traditional Florida skills and a research library with a variety of books, plans, logs, diaries, periodicals, letters, records and related archival material whose content is relevant to research concerning maritime subjects, with special emphases on Florida‚Äôs Gulf Coast. The museum is housed in a 1912 schoolhouse building at the Cortez Nature Preserve at 4415 119th Street West. Other historic structures located on the site include the 1890 Burton Store, a wood cistern, and the Pillsbury Boat Shop.  Mission  The Florida Maritime Museum's mission is to collect, preserve and share traditional knowledge, cultural artifacts and personal stories specific to Florida‚Äôs fishing and maritime heritage.  Historic Structures and Grounds  The Florida Maritime Museum is located on 4 acres of land that include native plant gardens, fountains, historic structures, and maritime objects. The grounds are open to the public from dusk to dawn. The Cortez Rural Graded Schoolhouse in the 1920s. Photo courtesy of Manatee County Public Library System.  1912 Cortez Rural Graded Schoolhouse  The Cortez Rural Graded Schoolhouse was constructed in 1912 as one of six schools built by Manatee County that year. It replaced an older one room structure that still stands in the village. Originally three classrooms, in 1933, under a Federal Works Progress Administration program, the middle classroom was extended into an auditorium with stage forming a T-shaped floor plan. It was used as a school until 1961, when it was leased to an art school. It was ultimately sold to Robert Sailors, a master weaver, who made the building his home and studio. In 1999, Manatee County purchased the property and carefully restored the building. In 2006, it was reopened as the Florida Maritime Museum. The Cortez Schoolhouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Cortez Historic District. = Robert Sailor's Secret Garden and Butterfly Garden = In 1974, Robert Sailors, a master weaver, purchased the Cortez Schoolhouse and transformed the property into his studio and living quarters. Sailors added two patios to the exterior of the schoolhouse, with one featuring a water sculpture of blue ceramic tile and lead-glass windows. Today, the Florida Maritime museum continues to maintain the water sculpture as well as other sculptures featured throughout the grounds.  1890 Burton/Bratton Store  The Albion Inn and Burton Store, directly on the Cortez waterfront, with fishing boats tied in front sometime in the early 1900s. Photo courtesy of Manatee County Public Library System. In the 1890s, William C. Bratton built the first commercial building at Hunter's Point, the original name of the area eventually to be called Cortez. The building served as post office, general store and steamboat wharf and connected the village's fishing families with the outside world. In 1900, rooms were added creating an inn which became known at the Albion Inn. Expanded over time, the Albion Inn along with the 1912 Cortez Schoolhouse served as refuge for the displaced residents of the small village during the destructive 1921 hurricane. In 1974, the inn closed and the property was sold to the US Coast Guard. Community effort spearheaded by the Cortez Village Historical Society and the Florida Institute of Saltwater Heritage (F.I.S.H.) saved the store from demolition in 1991. It was moved to this site in 2006. After renovations, the store was reopened as a part of the Florida Maritime Museum in 2018.  Pillsbury Boat Shop  Edward Ithamar Pillsbury (1844-1930) started the Snead Island Boat Works on Snead Island in 1907. The Pillsbury Boat Shop was the first building constructed at the Snead Island Boat Works and named in honor of his son, Asa Harmon Pillsbury (1900-1985). As the boat works grew to accommodate the demand for larger boats, additional buildings were added to the complex and the original building was modified for use as a machine shop, housing a lathe, small milling machine, and other metal working tools. Eventually the property was sold in 1930s and the Pillsburys moved the structure to their home three miles away. It served as a machine shop there, too, and was used to repair the Pillsbury dredging company's equipment. In 2007, the historic boat shop was transported, with sheriff escort, from Palmetto to the Florida Maritime Museum in Cortez.

Anchor of the Steamship 'Mistletoe'  The Florida Maritime Museum's grounds feature the anchor of the steamship the 'Mistletoe.' The steamship, owned by Tampa fisherman John Savarese, regularly brought passengers and goods to from Tampa to Sarasota. The steamship stopped throughout Manatee County, including Bradenton and Cortez, until sinking in a hurricane in 1910. Shortly after she sank, the steamship was raised, renovated, and rechristened 'The City of Sarasota' in 1911. She continued to carry passengers and cargo from Tampa to Sarasota until 1917. Pillsbury Boat Works on Snead Island purchased the steamship and converted her into a barge for a short time before pulling her ashore and burning her.  Marine Railway Winch  The railway winch located on the Florida Maritime Museum's grounds was used to haul large boats out of the water and into a repair station or dry-dock. The winch has a carriage pivotally connected to a support frame near the front of the carriage, and on a traverse horizontal axis. The rear of the support frame is provided with support abutments that are adjustable to accommodate the contour of the boat. A cable loop extends from a submerged pulley at the other end of the railway, and engages a winch activated by a remote control unit. The carriage is interposed in one side of the loop. This winch was used in the local area until the late 1980s. This unit‚Äôs last location was the Rivertown Boatworks located on the Manatee River in Bradenton.  Collections = The Blake Banks Collection  Captain Blake Banks was a successful Cortez fisherman with a passion for sea life. His collection is well documented, making it especially important academically. All of his specimens were collected in the Gulf of Mexico, some of which were eventually donated to the Florida Maritime Museum by his widow, Betty. Researchers and volunteers at the museum have been working studiously to create a chart that serves as a snapshot of where these specimens were collected.  Ship Models  Many of the models on display at the Florida Maritime Museum are miniature versions of real ships that played a role in Florida‚Äôs maritime history.  Maritime Library  The Florida Maritime Museum is home to a small library of books on maritime topics that range from tales of old Florida to boat building and design. In addition to books, the museum houses a collection of boat plans, nautical charts and other archival materials that are available for scholarly research.  The Folk School at the Florida Maritime Museum  The Folk School, which began in January 2017, enables Florida Maritime Museum to take their mission a step further with hands-on classes formulated to not only learn and preserve classic skills, but to share stories, build community and grow appreciation for the history of Cortez and the greater surrounding area.

Posenenske created series of sculptures that explored systems and structures derived from mass production and standardization.  Background  Posenenske was born in Wiesbaden, Germany. Her father was Jewish. Due to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany, he killed himself when Posenenske was aged nine. Two years after this, Charlotte Posenenske went in to hiding to avoid persecution Before becoming a painter and sculptor, Posensenske worked several years as a set and costume designer. Posenenske studied painting with Willi Baumeister in the early 1950s at the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart. She began creating her own artworks in 1956. Career Posenenske worked in a variety of mediums, her practice becoming more abstract through the course of the 1960s. After early, improvised ‚Äúart informel‚Äù paintings made with a palette knife or spray gun, she in 1967 and 1968 turned to industrially inspired sculptures of aluminum, steel or cardboard, whose modular components could be combined and reproduced at will.Jason Farago (June 13, 2019), Dia Diversifies, While Staying True to Its Roots The New York Times. While other artists of the period worked in multiples, where a finite edition of a work could be produced, Posenenske worked in series, meaning that there was no limit to the editions. Her approach toward art was highly democratic. Posenenske rejected the commercial art market, offering her work for sale at its material cost.Jason Farago (June 13, 2019), Dia Diversifies, While Staying True to Its Roots The New York Times. Reconstructions authorised by the artist‚Äôs estate are not replicas, and they are outwardly identical to the original prototype. Only the certificate differentiates the unsigned work from other commodities. Posenenske's Vierkantrohre Serie (Square Tube Series) consisted of industrially manufactured steel tubes similar in appearance to air conditioning shafts. Her work is similar to ready-mades in appearance, but Posenenske directed production of materials in her work process. Posenenske was an early proponent of inviting interactivity to her artwork through choreographed performances and audience participation. She invited artists and curators to freely rearrange and add to her work in several exhibitions. In 1968 Posenenske published a statement in the journal Art International referencing the reproducibility of her works, and her desire for the concept and ownership of the piece to be accessible: :I make series :because I do not want to make individual pieces for individuals, :in order to have elements combinable within a system, :in order to make something that is repeatable, objective, :and because it is economical. :The series can be prototypes for mass- production. :[...] :They are less and less recognisable as \\"works of art.\\" :The objects are not intended to represent anything other than what they are. Poseneske stopped working as an artist in 1968, no longer believing that art could influence social behavior or draw attention to social inequalities. She retrained as a sociologist and became a specialist in employment and industrial working practices, particularly assembly line production, until her death in 1985. During this period of self-imposed exile Posenenske refused to visit any exhibitions, and did not show her work.

The was an antecedent to such craft with its low-profile deck and gun turret. Russian and North Korean semi- submersible naval vessels evolved from torpedo boats and special forces boats that could partially submerge (sometimes to snorkel depth) to perform their missions. The US Navy SEALs use such vessels for clandestine special forces actions. Efforts to embody advantageous surface-ship characteristics into submarines have not been widely adopted. Antecedent The first US Navy ironclad ship, the USS Monitor, exhibited a low surface profile. USS Monitor was an iron-hulled, steam-powered warship‚Äîbuilt during the American Civil War‚Äîas the first ironclad warship commissioned by the Union Navy. The Monitor is noted for its role in the Battle of Hampton Roads in 1862, when it fought indecisively against the casemate ironclad, . The novel design of the ship, distinguished by its revolving turret and low profile, was quickly duplicated and established the monitor type of warship for use in shallow coastal waters. Its low-freeboard deck‚Äîonly above the water‚Äîwith a single gun turret gave it the appearance of a \\"cheesebox on a raft\\", according to observers of the time. The designer, John Ericsson, had deliberately minimized the observable surface of the vessel and the area that it presented as a target. The Monitor was not designed to be semi-submersible, however. True semi-submersibles Examples of true semi-submersible naval vessels were developed in the Russian Empire, North Korea and the United States. Russian Empire Semi-submersible Imperial Russian Navy torpedo boat, Keta The Imperial Russian Navy developed semi-submersible vessels‚Äîstarting with the ‚Äîwhich were designed to be torpedo boats with low visibility for coastal protection against enemy warships. Keta was built in 1904 in St. Petersburg, powered by a motor, displacing 8 tons, and with a length of . It saw service in 1905 during the Russo-Japanese War to protect the coast in the Far East. Keta was followed by other designs, \\"Variant D\\" and \\"Type F\\". North Korea According to the Covert Shores Naval Warfare Blog, North Korea's Korean People's Navy developed semi- submersible for infiltration of agents and use by special forces. These derived from high-speed surface craft, sometimes disguised as fishing vessels. The I-SILC model was the first semi-submersible, which could submerge to snorkel depth to power its combustion engine. Approaching its insertion point, the vessel operates as a planing power boat. This evolved into two models of Taedong semi-submersibles, the B and C models, which were exported to Vietnam and Iran. The Taedong‚ÄìC is a semi-submersible variant of the IPS-16 Peykaap torpedo boat. North Korean semi-submersibles have been intercepted while making incursions into South Korean waters. In 2002, North Korea delivered five Taedong semi-submersible vessels to the Iranian Navy as part of an arms shipment that included other types of gunboats and patrol boats. United States Naval Special Warfare Command SEALION II In 2014, the United States Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWARCOM) unveiled its SEAL Insertion, Observation, and Neutralization (SEALION) craft, designed and built as a Combatant Craft Heavy (CCH). The craft is designed for low radar observability and can carry crew and payload internally. At that time there were two units operational, with a third one ordered for delivery in 2018. The SEALION is reportedly a semi-submersible with a planing hull for surface running and ballast tanks to run with a reduced profile. Its dimensions are long, abeam, and from keel to cabin roof. It displaces and is powered by two ten-cylinder, diesel engines. Its aft payload bay is configured to accommodate either two inflatable boats, one special forces modified jet ski, or eight seats. Submarine hybridization French submarine, Surcouf with heavy artillery As a related development, the hybridization of submarines to acquire certain surface ship attributes has included the augmentation of firepower and surface speed. Firepower Cruiser submarines combined of the stealth of a submarine with the endurance and firepower of a surface ship; several were the largest submarines built at the time of their launching. They were designed to attack merchant marine shipping with heavy deck guns, as well as torpedoes. They were generally slower to dive and offered a bigger sonar signature than conventional submarines. Examples are: * The 1916 German Type U 139 submarine (WWI, 3 boats), which mounted two SK L/45 deck guns and two SK L/30 deck guns. * The 1923 HMS X1, which mounted two guns in 2 twin turrets. * The 1934 French submarine Surcouf, which mounted two naval guns. * The 1939 Soviet K-class submarines, which mounted two naval guns. Speed SMX-25, a French design concept for a submarine that travels at high speed on the surface to arrive in theater. Before the advent of nuclear power, submarines were slower on the surface than surface ships and even slower underwater. Therefore, efforts were made to increase submarine surface speeds on a par with ships, such as: * The 1916 British K-class submarine was equipped with steam turbines to provide sufficient surface-running speed to accompany the battle fleet as a reconnaissance vessel, but proved to be unsuccessful.Everitt, Don (1963). The K Boats. London: George Harrap * The 1930s Soviet embodied the hull contours of a destroyer for high speed on the surface, but proved to be underpowered. * The 1960s Soviet Project 1231 was a concept for a missile boat that would travel with hydrofoils on the surface and then dive to avoid observation, which was never built. * The 2010 French SMX-25 was a submarine design concept by defence company, DCNS, with surface ship characteristics, which would allow high surface speed for more rapid deployment to the combat zone and then submerging to attack.

The community includes the Pass-a- Grille Historic District, Gulf Beaches Historical Museum, and Pass-A-Grille Beach. The small beach town includes restaurants, retailers, and waterfront areas on the Gulf of Mexico as well as the intercoastal waterway. It is located on a barrier island. History The area around Pass-a-Grille has been inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years and was first spotted by Spanish explorers in 1528 when P√°nfilo de Narv√°ez anchored off Pass-a-Grille pass. Local legend states that it was named from the French phrase Passe Aux Grilleurs (the passageway of the grillers) in honor of the fisherman who camped and first settled there. John Gomez was one on the first entrepreneurs to utilize Pass-A-Grille Beach as a vacation area, inviting travelers from St. Petersburg and Tampa to stay at his resort-like structure as early as 1857. Some of the first major businessmen in the area were Roy S. Hanna and Selwyn Morey, who began developing plots of land for homes and lodgings at Pass-A-Grille Beach. By 1901, Frenchman and Travel Agent, George Henri Lizotte, opened the first Pass-A-Grille hotel, named Bonhomie. The first schoolhouse in Pass-a-Grille was constructed in 1914 at the cost of $1,000 and opened its doors to students in the winter of 1915. Pass-a-Grille was eventually incorporated into the city of St. Pete Beach in 1957, and in 1989 Pass-a-Grille was recognized as a National Register Historic District. Recreation Pass-a-Grille Park The beach, boutiques, an ice cream shop, outdoor art market, restaurants, tennis courts, and fishing piers are all located within walking distance.
