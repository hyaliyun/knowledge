It is an interactive movie title with live action visuals in the vein of a spy film.  Plot  Jack Fremont is known for his knowledge of TV shows; it turns out life is rough right now. He is about to get kicked out of his house. However, when bragging about his knowledge he is confronted by CIA agents. They tell him that there is a terrorist on the loose who wants to blow up Los Angeles. The terrorist is uncredited in some TV shows and now it's up to Jack to stop him. Gameplay The gameplay of this game is varied. In some places the player character explores rooms and finds objects, and in others he enters fighting and action sequences. There is time limit in many of these sequences. A red box in the corner of the screen informs the player when they need to take action during a quick time event. Development Fox Hunt was developed on a budget of $2 million. Development was largely handled by movie studio 3Vision, with writer/producer Matt Pyken, producer/lawyer Adam Berns, and director Michael Berns (Adam's brother) at the helm. The Pyken/Berns/Berns trio had previously created the 1994 PC game National Lampoon's Blind Date. Casting for the game was conducted in the second quarter of 1995. The game was filmed over 35 days, mostly at the former Ambassador Hotel, though four days were set aside for shooting skiing footage in Aspen, Colorado. George Lazenby commented on the shooting schedule: \\"Actors need a lot of flexibility since scenes are shot so quickly and you instantly go from being good to being evil. As Bond [in On Her Majesty's Secret Service], I once waited three days while the crew prepared to film a single scene! On Fox Hunt we do a new scene every hour. It's the way movies should be made.\\"  Reception  Computer Game Review gave the game a negative review, calling it \\"just another example of how unplayable interactive movies can be.\\" GameSpot said this about the game: \\"Overlooking some of the childish antics of its hero, Capcom's Fox Hunt is an interactive movie that merits more than a showing or two. It's silly and amusing but surprisingly well developed and fun to play.\\" and gave it a 6.8.

Visual Works was founded as the CGI department for Square and was responsible for creating the pre-rendered CG openings for the company, starting with Final Fantasy VII in 1997. Beginning with Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children (2005) the company began to work on stand-alone CGI films, continuing with Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV (2016). After the acquisition of Taito and Eidos Interactive by Square Enix, Visual Works branched out their functionality to create cinematic scenes for Square Enix's acquired publishing brands, whilst continuing to primarily work on Square Enix's in-house properties. Visual Works are assisting Square Enix with the lighting and cinematic direction of the Kingdom Hearts franchise for the high definition entries. History Visual Works was founded as a subsidiary CGI production company for Japanese video game developer and publisher Square around 1997. The company's first project was the 1997 Final Fantasy VII. They have continued to produce video game scenes for the company, remaining a subsidiary after the merger of Square and Enix into Square Enix in 2003, and expanded to create cinematic's for more video game franchises after Square Enix acquired Taito and Eidos Interactive. Working at Visual Works is considered to be among the elite of Square Enix technical jobs. In 2005, Visual Works produced their first stand-alone project, the feature-length CGI film Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. They produced a second stand-alone film, Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV, in 2016. Process The studio's creative freedom in creating cutscenes varies from project to project. Director Kazuyuki Ikumori explained in 2015 that some projects allow them complete freedom to decide the direction of the scenes and where they best fit, while others more narrowly define for the studio the length and location of the scene and how it begins and ends. Some projects also consult with the studio on which scenes work better as interactive scenes than passive cutscenes. Visual Works does not try to have different styles based on if a game originates in Japan or Western countries, such as for former Eidos properties, but instead try to match the style of the game series or development studio. Ikumori noted that for some series, such as those by Crystal Dynamics or IO Interactive, they receive a lot of detail about the feeling of the scenes, which they take as a starting point, but for others such as Final Fantasy they know the series so well that they can easily match the developers' intent. Ikumori credits this last to his previous work as a map and character designer for the Final Fantasy series. Visual Works uses motion capture to design the movements of their CGI characters; Ikumori has described the process as being \\"really about the center of balance and that transition of balance\\" than about the exact motions. Especially for more fantasy-oriented series, they use the motion capture data as a basis to overlay with more exaggerated, \\"flashy\\" movements that still reflect the way the characters normally move. Demonstration work In 2019, a four and a half minute trailer titled ‚ÄúVisual Works Character Prototype‚Äù was developed of a woman with an eyepatch fighting a doll. Previous demonstrations had been done with Visual Works employees ideas, but Square Enix president Yosuke Matsuda suggested making a demo based on this female character. Starting only with the concept of ‚Äúa woman with an eyepatch‚Äù, Visual Works then expanded the world around her to give the character a lot of detail, the kind that would impress prospective game developers. While acknowledging that such projects are time intensive, Kazuyuki Ikumori, the general manager and chief creative director of Visual Works has noted that such projects are already very difficult and expensive, and that such projects get game developers and those making CGI visuals on the same page early on. The video was based on ‚Äúoriental dark fantasy‚Äù as seen by those who do not know Japanese culture, and has elements of Noh such as a Noh mask.

Fuller Boos (June 17, 1892 ‚Äì August 20, 1978) was an influential actor in the study of pegmatite geology. Although she did not begin her career in the study of pegmatite, it became her niche as her career developed. Boos spent a large portion of her life throughout the Colorado Rockies. Through her many years of fieldwork, she was most noted for her ability to map a large proportion of the Front Rage in Colorado with the help of her husband, Charles Maynard Boos.  Early life  Margaret n√©e Fuller was born June 17, 1892 in Beatrice, Nebraska, United States, the daughter of Roy D. Fuller and Mabel A. Bradley Fuller. She began her post-secondary education in Lincoln at the University of Nebraska. This is where she spent the first two years of her undergraduate degree before finishing the remaining two years of her degree at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Margaret completed her Bachelor of Science in 1913. She then worked as a high school science teacher post her undergraduate degree. Fuller decided to then return to her education in 1920 at the University of Chicago, where she then completed her M.A. in Geology. In 1924 Margaret Fuller received her Phd from the University of Chicago.  Geological contributions  Margaret B. Fuller Boos' primary interest was in mapping and interpreting the granite intrusives on the Colorado Front Range and discovered the first lithium pegmatite in the front range. During her time as a geology professor, she mapped the granite intrusives and pegmatites in the Denver Mountain Parks area. In 1922, Boos mapped the Precambrian area north and south of the Big Thompson River, as well as the extent of the Longs Peak and Mt. Olympus granites. In 1924, she continued her research in the Big Thompson River, yet this time focusing on the glacial features along the river. After her marriage to Charles Maynard Boos, the newly weds both went out to work for Empire Gas and Fuel as petroleum geologists. In the summer of 1928, she was offered a job as a part-time ranger-naturalist at Rocky Mountain National Park. After accepting the job, offered to her by the superintendent Roger Toll, she became the first female ranger-naturalist at Rocky Mountain National Park. Toll wrote to her that he \\"[would] prefer a man for the job\\", but her expertise outshined her status as a woman. One year later, in 1929, Roger Toll offered Boos a full-time position working at the Park, but she graciously declined the offer and returned to the petroleum industry. During the summers of 1929 - 1931 Margaret and Charles spent their time elaborating and expanding on Margaret's \\"Hard Rock\\" thesis. The two combined their work with the Colorado School of Mines and the University of Wisconsin; this led to a series of presentations and conversations, resulting in their summary paper on Longs Peak-St.Vrain Batholith. The Boos' work was considered important to geology at the time because the plutons and their contacts had not been previously determined. Margaret began teaching once again at the University of Denver in South Denver, Colorado, where she and her student, Esther Aberdeen, published a paper with a map describing these plutons. Boos began to further investigate the pegmatites throughout the Denver Mountain Parks region. Margaret then notes that there are tourmaline-bearing and beryl-bearing pegmatites. This began further research into beryl, mica, tantalum and lithium pegmatites. In 1943, Margaret began working full-time for the Bureau of Mines on their strategic minerals program. She transferred to the United States Bureau of Reclamation (1945) in order to move back to Denver. In 1947, Boos quit the bureau to become a geological consultant with her office at home. She then published her pegmatite conclusions in 1945, which contained a map of the Denver Parks area covering 540 square miles of the area. Afterwards, Margaret continued as an active geologist until 1968. Margaret and her husband also worked for Sharples Oil and Carter Oil for some time. Their experiences in these companies, and focus on stratigraphy, led to one of their most significant contributions; a paper about the tectonics of the eastern flank and foothills of the Front Range in Colorado.  Pegmatite in the Colorado Front Range  Margaret began mapping the Colorado Front Range in the summer of 1921. Specifically, Margaret examined and mapped different sections of the Precambrian terrain of the Front Range in order to describe the relationship between the Precambrian tectonics and the Laramide and post-laramide tectonics in 1921-1922, 1928-1929, and 1932-1934. Areas that were locally known were mapped in detail between the years 1934 and 1943. Work that was done previously was reviewed in the field and areas that were previously not mapped, were examined in 1950-1951 and 1953-1955. Margaret's husband, Charles, mapped the sedimentary formations of the eastern foothills of the Front Range between 1930 and 1952 and continued his work throughout 1954 and 1955. Throughout her mapping exploration of the Denver Rockies area, Fuller discovered that the pegmatites were scattered around and near the granite deposits. The exploration and discoveries that Margaret Fuller was making on the subject of pegmatites were based on her doctoral thesis while completing her Ph.D. at the University of Chicago. Though this went unnoticed until it was rediscovered by D.M Sheridan, one of Margaret's great discoveries in the Front Range was the discovery of green tourmaline. She discovered this rare mineral at the Bald Mt. pegmatite in 1939. Margaret and her husband, Charles, were attracted to the pegmatite found in granite deposits throughout the front range. Although they were primarily working in the oil industry or \\"soft rocks\\", they spent their free time exploring their \\"hard rock\\" theory regarding pegmatite. One of the things that this couple accomplished, was the ability to distinguish all the varying types of granite that appeared throughout the front range. This included the \\"Sherman granite, Log Cabin granite, Longs Peak (Mt. Olympus) Vrain granite, Boulder Creek granite,Silver Plume granite, Mt.Evans granite, Pikes Peak granite and Cripple Creek granite\\". The area had not been previously mined so the discovery and documentation of the region was a huge geological step in the Denver Rockies region. Boos' most significant paper, titled Genesis of Precambrian granitic Pegmatites in the Denver Mountain Parks area, Colorado, was published in 1954. This paper included the detailed descriptions and locations of 23 pegmatites. Out of these 23 pegmatites, 16 had never been described before.  Awards and recognitions  In 1964, Margaret B. Fuller Boos established the Margaret Fuller Boos Fellowship in Geology at Northwestern University. The Fellowship awards $2,000 per year to a woman graduate student in the field of geology. Later on in life, Boos was awarded a lifetime membership to the Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists, as well as the Distinguished Alumnus Award from Northwestern University. As her final recognition in the field of petroleum geology, she was honoured the title of \\"Petroleum's First Lady\\" at the International Petroleum Exhibition in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Due to her continuous support of women studying geology at Northwestern University, the Margret Fuller Boos Scholarship is now awarded to outstanding female geologists attending Northwestern. In 1975 Margaret Fuller Boos was honoured by The US Board of Geographic Names when they named a mountain in the Talkateena Mountains of central Alaska in honour of Peggy Boos. The unnamed mountain has since been renamed 'Peggy's Peak'.  Personal life  Margaret B. Fuller Boos was a daughter, wife and aunt. On September 3, 1927, Margaret married fellow geologist C. Maynard Boos in Estes Park, Colorado. Margaret Fuller Boos died on August 20, 1978 in Denver, Colorado.

Background  A telex came in from Hull to the Met's motorway control on the M11 that an organ was being flown into Stansted, and would need to be at the Cromwell Hospital by 12:30. Officers from the Metropolitan Police were sitting in their Rover SD1 3.5 patrol cars at J7 of the M11 just outside Harlow, Essex. An Essex Police car had gone up onto the runway at Stansted. The Essex car had gone up the slip road at J7 and handed over the liver to Graham Fordham, one of the Met Officers featured in the run.  The Route  The police took off down the M11 at 11:54, facing little congestion. They got up to speeds of up to 120 mph. As the motorway ends and becomes the M15 (now North Circular A406, was under construction at the time) the police exit at the Redbridge Roundabout, and go onto the A12 Eastern Avenue. They go up to Wanstead; this section is now bypassed by a tunnel built under Wanstead Green in 1999 as part of the M11 Link Road. They face heavy congestion along Cambridge Park; however at Blake Hall Road a police officer helps them get through the lights. They proceed to the Green Man Roundabout and onto the former A11 (now A106) High Road Leytonstone, where they go along with speeds of up to 60 mph, and sometimes taking the wrong side of the road. They continue along the A11, facing congestion at Gardener's Corner near Aldgate. They go through Leman Street and onto Lower Thames Street (A100). They face even more congestion along Embankment, with their average speed being 5 mph an hour. PC Les Crossland recalls being \\"a little bit lost over West London\\". They go round the Wedding Cake outside Buckingham Palace and towards Hyde Park Corner. Here they cut straight across the junction onto South Carriage Drive. The officers arrive at the hospital at 12:25 to deliver the organ for Aliza Hillel, an Israeli woman.  Main officers involved in the run  52 total officers were involved, manning the junctions, on motorbikes etc. Here are the main ones, mostly drivers from the two Rover SD1s tasked with delivering the organ. *PC William (Bill) McIntrye, driver of the lead car with liver *PC Graham Fordham, co-driver of the lead car *PC Les Crossland, driver of the video equipped backup car *PC Steve McCabe, co-driver of the backup car  Helicopter usage  Many people have asked why a helicopter was not used. The London Air Ambulance wasn't established until two years later in 1989, and the day before, a Met helicopter had a crash landing and all helicopters were suspended from use.  Re-runs  In 2014, For the Love of Cars did a re-run of the journey, after a Rover SD1 found in an old garage in Essex was set to be restored. The show's stars Ant and Phil, with Met Police SEG outriders, did a re-run. It took them over an hour to complete the journey, compared to the impressive 30 minutes in 1987.  TV  The run has been shown on a Police Camera Action! special in 1996. Police Stop! did a special episode on it to celebrate its 10th anniversary in 1997. Unlike the Police Camera Action show the year before, the entire journey was shown.

Ashkan Rahgozar is the director of The Last Fiction. The main idea of the recounting of this tale is to lend a different perspective to the legends and heroes of ancient Iranians. Production started in 2010, and since then over 100 animators have worked on the film. Shahram Nazeri has performed the music for the final credits of the film. Summary At a time when the shadow of Ahriman fell over the lands, King Jamshid, together with an army of his allies and with the Divine Virtue to accompany him, faced the army of Ahriman. With the will of Yazdan, Jamshid beat the Ahriman's army. He sits on the throne and proud of his conquest he acclaims that his victory is that of God. He calls on his allies to conquer the lands of the Ahriman and to hunt them down. However, Yazdan forsakes him and thus takes away his glory. Alone, Jamshid falls prey to greed and an insatiable madness. He leaves his daughter Shahrzad and bids the Council of Ministers that Mardas, the ally of the southern lands, sit on his throne in his absence. The following day, Jamshid, together with an army of his finest soldiers, sets out for the northern lands to hunt down Ahriman. He never returns. Mardas dies and according to the command of the Council, Madras's only son, Zahhak, is to take over Jamshid's throne on behalf of his father. Alas, Zahhak‚Äôs very presence is pregnant with darkness. This darkness falls over the city and Jamkard is thrust into gloom and terror. Yet, once more with the passage of time an infant is born to a family of farmers in the heart of Jamkard who is named Fereydun...

Iranian folk music is one of the old, influential and cultural music styles in the Middle East. It‚Äôs transmitted through generations among the people of Iran. We have tried to use notes from different regions of Iran. From West of Iran (Kurdish/Uramani /Lori) to the east (Khorasani /Dutar); from North (Mazandaran) to South (Qeshm). Some of the performers played their regional instruments in Dohol Studio in Iran and the Orchestra was performed in F.A.M.E‚Äôs project in Macedonia under supervision of Mr. Rezai. The main instrument of these soundtracks is Dutar, one of the historical instruments of Iran, and it was, originally, played by Bakshy- tribe. Bakshy-people are nomads, who‚Äôve been traveling, singing and telling stories while playing Dutar throughout Iran, for centuries. In ‚ÄúThe Last Fiction,‚Äù one of the main characters of the movie, Shahrzad, plays this historical instrument during her narration. The Graphic Novels=Jamshid Beginning with two double volume series Jamshid: Dawn and Jamshid: Fall, the tale and mythos of The Book of Kings is told through the story of the greatest kings of Persia and serves as the prologue and introduction into the ancient world of Iran and Ferdowsi's epic masterpiece Shahnameh.Many of the tales in The Book of Kings are epic morality tales of Gods and Heroes not unlike classic Greek mythology, Norse Mythology, Shinto, Celtic mythology, and even The Bible and, serves as the basis of cultural identity and a showcase for the historical literature of ancient Iran.The epic masterpiece itself is a treasure trove of drama and conflict consisting of sixty thousand verses, and paints an exquisitely rich tapestry of Gods and Heroes and Villains and Devils that, ultimately are deeply universal stories which continue to resonate even today, a thousand years later. These tales and characters can be compared to characters and stories in modern entertainment such as Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, and even Star Wars. Jamshid's journey as king was filled with victory, sacrifice, avarice, vainglory, and selfishness which was ultimately his downfall and was killed by the upstart, insidious Zahak. The graphic novels begin with Jamshid's tale and the feature animated film The Last Fiction begins as Zahak is replacing him on the throne and taking over the kingdom of Jamkard. Hoorakhsh Studios chose Jamshid's tale to depict in graphic novel form as it is rich in story and serves as the foundation and origin story for the film The Last Fiction and for the entire Shahnameh itself. The first edition Jamshid: Dawn was published in 2016 and is a free interpretation of his origin story in The Book of Kings, and the second volume Jamshid: Fall, depicts the time of his decadence and down fall which will be published in 2017, just ahead of the release of the film. Fourteen volumes depicting the epic battles, kingdoms won and lost, loves & alliances, and good versus evil that is all incorporated in The Book of Kings is planned by Hoorakhsh Studios. The studio plan to create a franchise around the stories and characters from The Book of Kings to share with the world. The graphic novels has been translated into English and published by Markosia and are available online now. Arshia Arshia is the story of Jamshid's Vozier and it is from the series of The Last Fiction Graphic novels. The two volumes of Arshia will soon be translated and published in English. Mobile Game The Last Fiction mobile game, ‚ÄòThe Divine Light‚Äô, directed by Babak Arjmand, and produced by Ehsan and Arman Rahgozar, a Hack and Slash game, has been published. Ashkan Rahgozar, the director of ‚ÄòThe Last Fiction‚Äô, is the executive producer of ‚ÄòThe Divine Light‚Äô. The game could be installed on Android and iOS platforms.

As of October 2020 Thomas works for CBS Sports. Between 2007-2019 Thomas worked as an MMA journalist and radio host. Early life Thomas was born in 1979 in the Republic of India, to an American foreign service officer father and a Syrian of Armenian descent mother who lived in Lebanon. Thomas mostly grew up in Washington DC, but lived in Marietta, Georgia for two years, graduating from Marietta High School. He graduated from The College of William & Mary. Between 1998‚Äì2005 he served in Battery H of the 3rd Battalion 14th Marines in Richmond, Virginia, reaching the rank of sergeant. While in college he started training in Judo, and while serving in the military he participated in the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program. Career Thomas has been dedicatedly following mixed martial arts since 2004. Between February 2006 and May 2007 (inactive between July 2006 and March 2007) Thomas founded and wrote commentary on his MMA dedicated blog Mad-Squabbles.com, with his online identity known as Mad Squabbles. In March 2007 the popular MMA website Fightopinion.com began promoting his articles. Fightlinker.com described the blog: \\"probably the best blog i‚Äôve seen pop up in the past six months. worth bookmarking and visiting every day.\\" From April 2007, leading MMA website UFCmania.com (acquired by SB Nation in 2009 as MMAmania.com) selected Mad Squabbles as one of its MMA beat reporters for its official MMA fighter ranking poll. Between 2008 and late 2010 he was color commentating live broadcast fight cards for the regional MMA promotion Ultimate Warrior Challenge. Between 2008 and 2012 Thomas was host to sports talk radio show MMA Nation on WJFK-FM (CBS Radio's 106.7 The Fan). From 2012 to August 2020 he was the host of The Luke Thomas Show on Sirius XM radio (Rush, channel 93). Between 2007 and 2011 contrary to a common misconception, Thomas was not the founder or co-founder of SB Nation's first MMA sports blog BloodyElbow.com (launched February 15, 2007). Founder Nate Wilcox (Kid Nate) recruited Thomas to help run it on May 21, 2007. Thomas eventually became editor in chief of BloodyElbow.com. It was reviewed as one of the best MMA news & media blogs online. Currently it is the #5 most popular MMA media & news website worldwide according to Alexa Internet. 2011-2019 he was an MMA senior editor at SB Nation and senior editor at MMAFighting.com (acquired by SB Nation November 2011 from AOL); a 2 million unique users per month website in 2011, and currently the #3 most popular MMA media & news website worldwide according to Alexa Internet. Also a two time (2013, 2015) World MMA Awards Media Source of the Year winner. Thomas was most notable on MMAFighting.com as a charter and regular panelist on The MMA Beat web series moderated by MMA journalist Ariel Helwani, and for his weekly webcast Promotional Malpractice and podcast Monday Morning Analyst. Since late 2019 Thomas got hired by ViacomCBS, initially working for Showtime and later for CBS Sports. Professional Views Thomas stated he likes MMA fighting because \\"Struggle and fear tackled by athleticism, technical know-how and innate desires for self-preservation brings out a side in humanity that exists only in the deepest recesses of our being. MMA fighting has no peer when it comes to the demands the sport places on its participants both physically and psychologically. And I love watching that dynamic in action\\"\\". But he hates everything else about the MMA world. He thinks many of the individuals in the industry are \\"utterly detestable\\". He suspects that \\"the majority of conversations [he has] with members of the fight community are either extended lies or at least contain a lie\\". Therefore, he tries to keep his direct contact with MMA promotions to a minimum. He dislikes Professional wrestling (Pro-wrestling) because \\"it sucks\\" and he doesn't like fiction. He is very irritated by MMA journalists or analysts who are \\"gigantic fat slobs\\". According to Thomas \\"One need not train five days a week to be a competent analyst of MMA, but experiencing the rigors of physical punishment certainly informs your judgment.\\" Controversy On June 15, 2010, Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) president Dana White misunderstood a Twitter exchange discussing his \\"ineptness\\" as an MMA promoter, between a fan and MMA Nation talk radio show host Thomas. White tweeted back to the fan, attacking Thomas \\"u shouldn't even respond to this douche who doesn't know shit about the sport ... never heard of this clown or his website or whatever it is.\\". When White realized that Thomas in fact responded positively about him to the fan, he tweeted an apology and on July 1, 2010 gave a live telephone interview to Thomas on MMA Nation as compensation . Thomas, and other MMA journalists and fans, have criticized the UFC for putting on too many shows and thus diluting the quality of their product. On March 7, 2014; while watching Bellator 111 fight event which he reviewed on Mmafighting.com earlier that day, Thomas tweeted \\"Dear ALL MMA Promoters: More MMA is not better. No one cares anymore. Better MMA is better. Please fix your product. Thanks in advance.\\". UFC president Dana White responded with the tweet \\"Dear whoever the hell u are. Nobody gives a shit what u think 02 is sold out and fans r pumped for 2 nite. Ur opinion=WGAF\\" (White was referring to March 8, UFC Fight Night 37 in London). When another Twitter member confronted White, tweeting \\" if nobody gives a shit what [Thomas] thinks, then why is he on @ufc countdown shows?\\" White responded with the tweet \\"I already said wont make that mistake again\\". UFC Countdown shows are \\"UFC‚Äôs documentary series profiling the fighters appearing in upcoming Ultimate Fighting Championship events\\" also featuring prominent MMA media members point of view. On March 24, 2016, Thomas revealed on The MMA Beat (Episode 102), that he is blocked from Dana White's Twitter feed. Fellow panelists, MMA journalists Chuck Mindenhall and Jeff Wagenheim stated the same, while Ariel Helwani was not. Helwani has since been blocked. Personal life In January 2014, following the reported suicide of MMA female fighter Cat Zingano's husband, Thomas shared that his mother took her own life when he was 23 years old (2003). Thomas described his loss \\"a pain that is torturous and inextinguishable\\". Thomas's wife is Colombian born and raised in Bogot√°. Thomas is into Oenophilia, since his family is in the wine business. Awards Thomas has been a 2014 Journalist Of The Year World MMA Awards nominee.

TD Trump Deutschland AG initially planned to build a residential tower in Berlin's central Alexanderplatz area. Trump's German business partner Hans Ulrich Gruber described Trump's aim as \\"to build a bridge between Berlin and New York.\\" However, his plan for the tallest building in Germany in the capital city was stymied by Berlin's relatively low (150 m) limit for new building height. The company settled on Pragsattel (Stuttgart) for the construction of what was to be a 55-story (220 m tall) building named Trump Tower, which would have been the highest building in south Germany. The project investment was estimated at 250 million Euro. Plans by architect Peter Paul Schweger for the project were presented in October 2001.

On his death, he was described by one obituary-writer as \\"one of the founders of modern Birmingham\\". J. L. Garvin called him \\"the Abb√© Siey√®s of Birmingham\\" (in allusion to one of the chief political theorists of the French Revolutionary era);Garvin and Amery 1932‚Äì69, vol. 1, p. 254 and Asa Briggs \\"a most active and intelligent wire-puller behind the scenes\\".Briggs 1952, pp. 167‚Äì8. He was dubbed the \\"father of the Caucus\\", the highly organised and controversial Liberal party machine that had its origins in Birmingham, but was afterwards introduced at national level to the National Liberal Federation. He served as the first Chairman of the National Liberal Federation from 1877 to 1882. By profession he was an architect and surveyor; and he was also a prolific journalist and author. Early life William Harris was born in 1826 in Cheadle, Staffordshire, the son of Joseph Harris and his wife Elizabeth, Swindell. His parents' liaison had met with the disapproval of their families, and they had eloped together in 1822, to be married at Gretna Green. William moved to Birmingham when young, and was educated at Rose Hill School, Handsworth.Anon. 1911, p. 62. Architectural career Extension to the Birmingham Banking Company building, Bennetts Hill, Birmingham, built 1881‚Äì84 The \\"Old Bank\\", Stratford-upon-Avon, built 1883 Harris was articled to a Birmingham architect, Isaac Newey, at the age of 15. On completion of his articles in 1847, he established his own architectural practice. He was the first architect in Birmingham to practise as a quantity surveyor, and came to specialise in this branch of the profession.Anon. 1911, pp. 62‚Äì3. In the late 1850s, he entered into a professional partnership with John Henry Chamberlain: it was short-lived, but the two remained friends, and in later life Harris would marry (as his second wife) Chamberlain's widow. In 1876 he began a partnership with Henry Martin, and in 1879 these two were joined by Harris‚Äôs son, Arnold Elsmere Harris (1854‚Äì1929), the firm subsequently practising as Harris, Martin and Harris.Anon. 1911, p. 63. Two notable commissions were, in 1881‚Äì84, an extension to the headquarters building of the Birmingham Banking Company in Bennetts Hill, Birmingham; and, for the same company in 1883, the \\"Old Bank\\" (now a branch of HSBC) in Stratford-upon-Avon, which was decorated with 15 terracotta panels of Shakespearean scenes by Samuel Barfield (1830‚Äì1887) of Leicester. The Old Bank is described by Chris Pickford for the Pevsner Architectural Guides as \\"Stratford's best Victorian building\\". Martin left the partnership in 1889, and William Harris retired in 1895. Combining his professional expertise with his enthusiasm for municipal reform, Harris served from 1877 to 1908 as clerk to the Birmingham, Tame and Rea District Drainage Board, at a time of major investment and improvement in the infrastructure of drainage and sewage disposal in Birmingham.Anon. 1911, pp. 63‚Äì4.Skipp 1983, pp. 165‚Äì6.Briggs 1993, pp. 214‚Äì17. He was a founder-member of the Birmingham Architectural Society in 1850, and was afterwards active in its affairs.Anon. 1889, p. 81. Politics As a young man, Harris was greatly impressed by the charismatic nonconformist minister, George Dawson, who preached the doctrine of social improvement and enlightened municipal reform subsequently known as the \\"Civic Gospel\\". He became a founder-member of Dawson's non-denominational chapel, the Church of the Saviour, in 1847, where fellow-members included George Dixon, J. T. Bunce, J. A. Langford, Robert Martineau, Samuel Timmins, A. Follett Osler, and Joseph Chamberlain.Anon. 1911, p. 64.Skipp 1983, p. 153. With many of these same individuals, he honed his political and reformist ideas at meetings of the Birmingham and Edgbaston Debating Society, of which he served as President in 1864‚Äì5.Marris 1900, p. 50.Anon. 1911, p. 69. He spoke publicly in support of Lajos Kossuth and the nationalist cause in Hungary, Garibaldi's republican struggle in Italy, and the liberation movement in Poland; and in criticism of the British government's conduct of the Crimean War.Anon. 1911, pp. 64‚Äì5.Langford 1877, pp. 6, 241, 247‚Äì8. In 1865 he became a founder-member of the Birmingham Liberal Association.Langford 1877, pp. 344‚Äì5. After George Dixon, the first secretary, was elected to parliament in a by-election in 1867, Harris succeeded him as secretary in 1868, and oversaw the Association's reorganisation in preparation for the general election of that year. He remained secretary until 1873, when he was succeeded in turn by Francis Schnadhorst. He subsequently held office as the Association's Vice-President and President, finally retiring from the latter position, for reasons of ill- health, in 1882.Anon. 1889, p. 84.Briggs 1993, p. 190. Also in 1865, he was himself elected to Birmingham Town Council, representing the united wards of Deritend and Bordesley. In the autumn of 1869 he headed the deputation that persuaded Joseph Chamberlain to stand for the Council, so launching the latter on a stellar political career.Garvin and Amery 1932‚Äì69, vol. 1, p. 100. However, in 1871, when addressing a Council meeting, Harris suffered a minor paralytic stroke. Although he made a full recovery, he was sufficiently concerned about his health to stand down as a councillor, and his own political career thereafter tended to be more that of a backstage manager and strategist.Rosenthal 2016, p. 93. The Yorkshire Post described him in 1884 as \\"of so modest and retiring a temperament that he is never seen or heard, and uninitiated people 'do not believe that there is any such person as Mr Harris', although he is the chief wire-puller\\".; part quoted in Reekes 2018, p. 101. He was an ardent campaigner ‚Äì again, alongside Dawson, Chamberlain, Dixon and others ‚Äì for a system of free, compulsory, and non-sectarian elementary education. He was joint honorary secretary of the Birmingham branch of the National Public School Association, established in 1850 but short- lived; sat on the committee of the Birmingham Education Society established in 1867; and, when this evolved in 1869 into the National Education League, continued to be a committee-member and a significant participant until 1877, when the League was wound up and absorbed unto the National Liberal Federation.Anon. 1911, p. 65.Langford 1877, p. 399.Herrick 1945, pp. 122‚Äì6.Hennock 1973, pp. 81‚Äì2. He tried to adapt his \\"Vote as you're told\\" scheme (see The Caucus below) to elections to school boards in 1870; but here the complexity of the voting system defeated him, and his strategies met with only limited success. He was a member of the Arts Club, which existed from 1873 to 1880 for the purpose \\"of facilitating the daily social intercourse of gentlemen professing Liberal opinions, who are engaged or interested in the public life of Birmingham\\".Marris 1900, pp. 182‚Äì3.Wilson 1905, pp. 127‚Äì9. The Caucus Harris is particularly remembered as the architect of the \\"Liberal Caucus\\". Under the 1867 Reform Act, Birmingham had been allocated three seats in the House of Commons, while each elector had two votes to cast. From a party perspective, there was a danger of votes being \\"wasted\\" by being cast in unnecessarily large numbers for a single popular candidate (specifically, at this time, John Bright), and of less popular candidates losing out. For the 1868 general election, Harris therefore introduced a new four-tier organisational structure ‚Äì of ward committees, General Committee, Executive Committee, and Management Committee ‚Äì by means of which Liberal supporters in different wards could be marshalled to vote for candidates in different combinations, so ensuring an even spread.Langford 1877, pp. 362‚Äì4.Garvin and Amery 1932‚Äì69, vol. 1, pp. 95, 254‚Äì5.Hennock 1973, pp. 132‚Äì3.Briggs 1993, pp. 190‚Äì1.Cawood 2019‚Äì20. The plan ‚Äì derided by its opponents as \\"Vote as you're told\\" ‚Äì was wholly successful, and all three Liberal candidates were returned to Parliament with little significant difference in their polling figures. The strategy's mathematical basis was analysed in 1884‚Äì5 by Charles Dodgson (\\"Lewis Carroll\\") in a booklet, The Principles of Parliamentary Representation. Harris himself justified his reforms on democratic grounds, arguing that the party structure \\"should not only be a reflex of popular opinion, but should be so manifestly a reflex of that opinion that none could doubt it\\".; citing In recognition of his contribution to the Liberal cause, a subscription list was prepared, and a gift of ¬£240 presented to him in May 1869.Langford 1877, p. 382; citing In 1877, this local model of organisational control was transferred, in a form modified by Harris, to the newly established National Liberal Federation.Watson 1907, pp. 4‚Äì9.Herrick 1945, pp. 126‚Äì8. Joseph Chamberlain acknowledged that \\"The whole credit of having initiated and carried out this new machinery belongs to my friend, Mr Harris.\\"Garvin and Amery 1932‚Äì69, vol. 1, p. 261. At the meeting in Birmingham on 31 May 1877 at which the Federation was launched, Harris delivered a \\"fiery harangue\\", again extolling the democratic foundations of the new structure, and arguing that it would henceforth be impossible for the government to ignore the popular will on such topical issues as the \\"Eastern Question\\".Ostrogorski 1902, vol. 1, pp. 175‚Äì6 He was elected the Federation's first Chairman (with Chamberlain as President, and Schnadhorst as Secretary), and held office until 1882, when he stood down for health reasons.Watson 1907, pp. 12, 34. It was this rigorously disciplined party machine, further consolidated and emulated elsewhere, that became known to both detractors and supporters as the \\"Caucus\\"; and Harris was named the \\"father of the Caucus\\".Anon. 1911, pp. 67‚Äì8.Garvin and Amery 1932‚Äì69, vol. 1, p. 261; vol. 2, p. 354.Whates 1957, pp. 104‚Äì5.Briggs 1993, p. 192. Liberal Party split In 1886, Joseph Chamberlain resigned from the Liberal government over William Gladstone's proposals for Irish Home Rule. The Birmingham Liberal Association, with the notable exception of Schnadhorst, stood behind Chamberlain. Harris was also among Chamberlain's supporters, but attempted to broker a compromise: he put a resolution to the National Liberal Federation which accepted the principle of a legislative assembly for Ireland, while at the same time asking Gladstone to maintain Irish representation at Westminster.Briggs 1952, p. 182. This was defeated, and, with other Birmingham Liberals, Harris resigned from the General Committee of the Federation.McGill 1962, p. 27. However, early in 1888 he transferred his allegiance to the Gladstone camp, and was reinstated.McGill 1962, p. 30. He eventually retired from the committee in 1895.Watson 1907, p. 184. Writing and cultural activities Title page of Harris's History of the Radical Party in Parliament (1885) Harris was a prolific writer in the radical cause. In 1855, with George Dawson, James Freeman, and others, he helped launch, and then became editor of, a local radical daily newspaper, the Birmingham Daily Press. This was well received, but a commercial failure: it merged with the Birmingham Mercury in 1857, and ceased publication entirely in November 1858.Whates 1957, pp. 45‚Äì6. In 1861, again with other members of the Dawson circle, he became one of the founders of, and an anonymous contributor to, a more successful satirical paper, The Town Crier. This sought, through humour, to compare \\"municipal government as it was ‚Äì in incompetent hands ‚Äì with municipal government as it might be\\", and \\"in those days wielded considerable influence in the town\\".Briggs 1993, pp. 197‚Äì8.Anon. 1911, p. 70.Hennock 1973, pp. 77‚Äì8. At the monthly Town Crier dinners Harris is described as being \\"amusingly epigrammatic\\".Anderton 1900, p. 135. He afterwards became an active (but still anonymous) leader-writer for the Birmingham Daily Post under the editorship of his friend, J. T. Bunce.Whates 1957, pp. 103‚Äì4. In this capacity, he is described by H. R. G. Whates as an \\"old Radical warhorse\\".Whates 1957, p. 117. Even after the 1886‚Äì8 split in the Liberal Party had distanced him from many of his former associates, he continued to contribute articles to the Post on foreign affairs and other topics. In 1848, he became one of a group of friends who met regularly at one another‚Äôs houses to discuss philosophical, political and social matters. They called themselves the \\"Inner Circle\\", and it became their custom to prepare some written presentation in advance. In 1850, three of the members, Harris, J. A. Langford and Henry Latham, published a volume of poems that had emerged from these sessions, entitled Thoughts from the Inner Circle. In 1885, Harris published a substantial History of the Radical Party in Parliament. Robert Spence Watson wrote in 1907 that this work \\"ought to be known to every Liberal\\";Watson 1907, p. 4. and H. R. G. Whates considered it \\"still not wholly superseded\\" in 1957.Whates 1957, p. 104. Harris was prominent on the committee that ‚Äì following a failed attempt in 1852 ‚Äì persuaded Birmingham Town Council in 1859 to adopt the Public Libraries Act, paving the way for the opening of the city‚Äôs Central Lending and Reference Libraries in 1865‚Äì6, and other branch libraries.Anon. 1911, p. 66. He subsequently served from 1868 to 1871 as chairman of the Birmingham Free Libraries Committee.Hennock 1973, pp. 93‚Äì4. In about 1858, he, Dawson, Samuel Timmins, Bunce, J. H. Chamberlain, and others in their circle, began to meet irregularly for literary and cultural discussions: by 1860, these meetings had been regularised into a more formal club, which in 1862 was named \\"Our Shakespeare Club\\". Whates calls Our Shakespeare Club \\"the intellectual centre of the community, [and] the nineteenth century equivalent of the famous Lunar Society\\".Whates 1957, pp. 106‚Äì8.Harris 1903. It was largely responsible for the establishment of the Shakespeare Memorial Library within the Central Library building in 1864 (the tercentenary year of Shakespeare's birth). Harris published an official History of the club in 1903. In 1870, along with J. T. Bunce, he was appointed by the Council to oversee the purchase of pictures and objects for the proposed Birmingham Art Gallery. He served on the council of the Birmingham and Midland Institute during the secretaryship of J. H. Chamberlain; and was also a member of the Birmingham Philosophical Society. Later years and death Headstone (now fallen) of William Harris, his first wife Sarah, and five of their six children, in Key Hill Cemetery, Hockley The split within the Liberal Party in 1886‚Äì8 over Irish Home Rule marked the disintegration of what had been a close-knit circle of like-minded reformers. In 1892, the radical preacher Dr Robert Dale, looking back to the 1870s, mused:Marris 1900, p. 300. Harris sat as a Justice of the Peace in Birmingham from 1880 until 1904, when increasing deafness forced his retirement. He died on 25 March 1911, of heart failure following an attack of bronchitis, and was buried, alongside his first wife, in Key Hill Cemetery, Hockley. Personal life In 1848, Harris married Sarah Elsmere (1824‚Äì1885), daughter of Richard Elsmere of High Ercall, Shropshire. The couple had six children, of whom a girl and three boys died in infancy, leaving two sons to survive to adulthood: Sydney (1852‚Äì1903), and Arnold (1854‚Äì1929), who joined his father in his architectural practice.Anon. 1889, p. 85. In 1888, Harris married as his second wife Anna Mary Chamberlain ( Abrahams), the widow of his friend and former professional partner, J. H. Chamberlain. She survived him.

He was a durable gelding who raced for seven seasons between 1993 and 1999, showing his best form over the one mile distance, and winning sixteen of his forty-eight races including major races in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and the United States. He also competed in Ireland, France and Dubai. He won at least one Group or Graded stakes race in each of his last six seasons, a feat which has only been bettered by Cirrus des Aigles. Originally trained in England by Michael Stoute, he was unraced until his three-year-old season when he won two minor races. In the following year he developed into a top class performer winning the Hambleton Stakes, Fortune Stakes, Kiveton Park Stakes and Supreme Stakes before taking the Hong Kong International Bowl. He went on to win the Lockinge Stakes in 1995 and 1996 before being transferred to the United States where he was trained by Kiaran McLaughlin. He added further major victories in North America, winning the Firecracker Handicap and the Fourstardave Handicap in 1997, the Robert F. Carey Memorial Handicap in 1998 and the Maker's Mark Mile Stakes in 1999. Background Soviet Line was a bay horse with a narrow white blaze and four white socks bred in Ireland by his owner Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum, a member of the ruling family of Dubai. He was originally sent into training with Michael Stoute at Newmarket, Suffolk. Soviet Line's owner used Maktoum Al Maktoum, an abbreviation of his full name, for his racing interests in Europe, while in North America his horses ran under the Gainsborough Farm banner. Soviet Line was sired by Soviet Star, an outstanding sprinter-miler whose wins included the Poule d'Essai des Poulains, Sussex Stakes, Prix de la For√™t, July Cup and Prix du Moulin. Soviet Star later became a very successful breeding stallion, siring major winners including Freedom Cry (Prix d'Harcourt), Starcraft, Ashkalani (Poule d'Essai des Poulains, Prix du Moulin), Starborough, Limpid (Grand Prix de Paris) and Pressing (Premio Roma). Soviet Line's dam Shore Line won only one minor race from seven starts but was a good stayer who finished fourth in the 1983 Epsom Oaks. Her grand-dam Dark Finale was also the ancestor of the Irish Oaks winner Pure Grain. Soviet Line was a very difficult horse to manage and had several quirks including a fondness for peppermint candies: he reportedly ate 31 candies at a single sitting. Racing career=1993: three-year-old season Soviet Line's racing career began at Leicester Racecourse on 3 April 1993 in a one-mile maiden race which he won at odds of 25/1. He followed up three weeks later at Salisbury winning a minor race over ten furlongs by five lengths. Walter Swinburn then took over as the gelding's regular jockey. Soviet Line failed to win in four subsequent starts that year but produced some promising efforts, starting with a third place in a handicap race at Doncaster Racecourse in May. After a lengthy break he returned for three races in the autumn including a third place in the Listed Darley Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in October. 1994: four-year-old season After finishing second on his first run as a four-year-old, Soviet Line was assigned weight of 125 pounds for the Hambleton Stakes, a Listed handicap over one mile at York Racecourse on 11 May. He took the lead two furlongs out and held on well in the closing stages to win by half a length from the five-year-old Philidor to record his first important victory. He was then stepped up in class but was not immediately successful, finishing unplaced in the Diomed Stakes and the Queen Anne Stakes. He was sent to Ireland in August and produced a more promising effort in the Desmond Stakes at the Curragh, finishing third to Heart Lake and Bin Ajwaad, but being promoted to second when the \\"winner\\" was disqualified. After finishing fourth in the Winter Hill Stakes at Windsor later that month he started 9/2 joint favourite for the Listed Fortune Stakes over one mile at Kempton Park Racecourse. He won his second race of the year as he led a furlong out and prevailed by a length from the three-year-old Polish Laughter. Six days after his win at Kempton, Soviet Line was stepped back up in class for the Group Three Kiveton Park Stakes at Doncaster. Starting at odds of 4/1 he had considerable trouble in running before obtaining a clear run inside the final furlong and overtook the front-running Maroof in the final strides and won by a neck. At the end of September Soviet Line started 2/1 favourite against eight opponents in the Group Three Supreme Stakes over seven furlongs at Goodwood and won again, taking the lead a furlong out and winning by three quarters of a length from Alanees. In October the gelding was moved up in class again to contest the Group Two Challenge Stakes at Newmarket. He started favourite but was beaten into second by Zieten with First Trump and Piccolo among the unplaced runners. On his final run of the year Soviet Line was sent to Sha Tin Racecourse in Hong Kong in December to contest the Hong Kong International Bowl, a race which later became the Hong Kong Mile. His thirteen rivals included Heart Lake and Young Ern (Hungerford Stakes) from Europe, Nijinsky's Gold (Kelso Handicap) and Megan's Interco (Shoemaker Stakes) from America, Gold Mountain from Japan and the locally trained Winning Partners (the winner of the race in 1993). After being towards the rear on the final turn, Soviet Line forced his way through the field in the straight, took the lead inside the last 200 metres and won by one and three quarter lengths and a head from Nijinsky's Gold and Heart Lake. An objection to the winner was lodged by the rider of the fourth placed Young Ern but the result was allowed to stand by the racecourse stewards. Michael Stoute praised Swinburn's ride, saying \\"I'm glad he listened when I said 'don't panic if they go off fast'\\". 1995: five-year-old season Soviet Line began his third season by making his first appearance at Group One level when he started 2/1 favourite for the Lockinge Stakes over one mile at Newbury on 21 May. His four opponents were Muhtarram, Missed Flight (Sandown Mile), Young Ern and Mutakddim. Swinburn sent the gelding into the lead from the start and Soviet Line ran on well in the closing stages to win by two lengths from Young Ern. Soviet Line failed to win again in 1995 but produced several good efforts. He finished third in the Queen Anne Stakes and then ran fourth to Sayyedati in the Sussex Stakes although he was relegated to fifth for causing interference in the latter race. In autumn he finished third to Bahri in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and second to Harayir in the Challenge Stakes. On his final appearance of the season he was sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Mile at Belmont Park and finished sixth of the thirteen runners behind Ridgewood Pearl. 1996: six-year-old season In the spring of 1996, Soviet Line finished unplaced in the Abernant Stakes and was then beaten a short head by Gabr (to whom he was conceding six pounds) in the Sandown Mile. On 18 May the gelding was ridden by Richard Quinn as he attempted to become the first horse in 25 years to win back-to-back runnings of the Lockinge Stakes and started the 13/2 third favourite behind Spectrum and Charnwood Forset. The other four runners included Gabr and the three-year-old Smart Alec. He raced in second behind Gabr before going to the front a furlong out and got the better of Charnwood Forest to win by a neck with a four length gap back to Spectrum in third. After the race Michael Stoute paid tribute to the gelding's work rider Sheena Dunlop, saying \\"The horse would not be what he is without Sheena. He's not an easy ride at home ‚Äì he takes a tug and hangs all over the place ‚Äì and no-one wants to ride him but her. She looks after him, and knows him well and is the greatest factor in his success\\". Commenting on the horse's future plans he noted that although the horse was \\"very game\\" the weight penalty he had to carry as a Group One winner was \\"a bit of a bugger\\". Soviet line failed to reproduce his best form in his three subsequent races. He finished fifth in the Queen Anne Stakes, last of seven behind Mark of Esteem in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and ninth of ten behind Alhaarth in the Prix du Rond Point at Longchamp Racecourse in October. 1997: seven-year-old season In April 1997 Soviet Line won at Jebel Ali Racecourse in Dubai and was then sent to race in the United States. He was trained in North America by Kiaran McLaughlin although Mark Hennig also conditioned the horse for some of his races. He finished fifth in the Dixie Stakes at Pimlico Race Course on his debut for his new trainer and then won an allowance race at Belmont Park on 7 June. Three weeks later he contested the Grade III Firecracker Handicap at Churchill Downs in which he was ridden by Pat Day and won by three and a half lengths from Volochine. At Saratoga Race Course on 25 July the gelding started favourite for the Grade III Fourstardave Stakes against six opponents. With Day again in the saddle he took the lead before half way and \\"dug in gamely\\" to repel the challenge of Val's Prince and win by a short head. After the race McLaughlin commented \\"It's neat that he's still doing what he wants to do. His best distance is a mile. He doesn't have a future as a stud, but he enjoys his work\\" whilst Day said \\"It wasn't pretty, but we got the job done\\". He returned in September to finish fifth to Fortitude in the Belmont Breeders' Cup Handicap and third to Wild Event in the Keeneland Breeders' Cup Mile Stakes. On 8 November he ran for the second time in the Breeders' Cup Mile (run that year at Hollywood Park Racetrack) and finished seventh behind Spinning World. 1998: eight-year-old season In 1998, Soviet Line began his season by finishing fifth in an allowance race at Gulfstream Park in March and then ran second to Lasting Approval in the Maker's Mark Mile Stakes at Keeneland in April. He won an allowance at Belmont in June but then failed to repeat his 1997 win in the Firecracker as he was beaten a nose by the four-year-old Claire's Honor. In July the gelding contested the Grade III Robert F. Carey Memorial Handicap at Hawthorne Race Course and started favourite against nine opponents. Ridden by Shane Sellers he overcame \\"traffic\\" problems on the second turn before overtaking the front-running Fun To Run in the closing stages and winning by one and three quarter lengths with Wild Event in third. The winning time of 1:33.4 was a new track record. Sellers, who was riding the horse for the first time said \\"I ended up about three wide turning for home. Down the stretch the opportunity presented itself. I pointed Soviet Line's nose into it, and he took me home. With that kind of horse you can make those kind of moves\\". In his two remaining races of 1998 he finished unplaced in the Fourstardave Handicap and second to Favorite Trick in the Keeneland Breeders' Cup Mile Stakes 1999: nine-year-old season The nine-year-old Soviet Line began his final season by finishing unplaced in an allowance at Gulfstream in March. In April he ran for the second time in the Maker's Mark Mile Stakes in which he was ridden by John Velazquez and started second favourite behind Trail City. After racing in fifth place he moved up to second on the final turn and stayed on strongly in the straight to win by a nose and a neck from Trail City and Rob 'n Gin. After the race the Gainsborough Farm manager Allen Kershaw said \\"The old man's amazing, isn't he? When they were coming down the stretch, I saw he was caught down on the rail. I figured he was going to be fourth. Then a hole opened up and he shot right through there.\\" He then finished third to Inkatha in the Red Bank Handicap at Monmouth Park in May before running for the third time in the Firecracker Handicap on 27 June when he finished sixth of the nine runners. Soviet Line was being prepared for a return to racing in autumn 1999 when he suffered a bruised foot in training and was retired to Maktoum Al Maktoum's Gainsborough Farm in Kentucky.

The church seats about 450 people. History The first historical mention of a church in H√¶gebostad was in 1445 and again in 1620. The medieval church was torn down in 1629 and replaced with a wooden long-form church. This timber church had small tower and small windows. It sat in a similar position to the location of the present-day church. By the 1840s, the church had become too small for the congregation, so a new church was constructed on the same site. Wood from the old church was reused in the new church which was completed in 1844.

Daulton rose to fame representing the nation of Myanmar in the groundbreaking 1994 legal case, United States v. Richard Diran and The Union of Myanmar, successfully recovering a 1,000-year-old Buddha statue that had been stolen in 1988 from a temple in Myanmar's ancient capital, Bagan, a treasure now on display in the National Museum in Yangon. This was the first cultural property claim litigated by a Southeast Asian nation in the United States. Daulton has also gained recognition as a result of the Daulton Collection‚Äìhis vast art collection which includes one of the world's largest private collections of German Symbolist art and, in particular, the world's largest collection of works by a number of individual artists, such as the eccentric monkey painter Gabriel von Max, the Austrian symbolist Rudolf Jettmar, and the proto-hippie Fidus.http://www.gabrielvonmax.com Among the Daulton Collection's highlights are masterpieces of symbolist portraiture, including Karl Gussow's Portrait of the Novelist Ossip Schubin (1887), Rudolf Jettmar's Self-Portrait of the Young Artist (1896), and Oskar Zwintscher's The Woman in Hamster (Portrait of the Artist's Wife, Adele) (1914). In addition, Daulton is well known as an expert on non-western art, architecture, and religion, acclaimed for his many lectures on those subjects for institutions such as National Geographic, The American Museum of Natural History, and The Art Institute of Chicago. He is also well known for his activity in exploration philanthropy, funding research expeditions around the globe, from archaeological digs in the Peruvian Andes to language documentation projects on remote atolls in Micronesia. https://www.peterfrost.org/expeditions/expedition-2016/team-member- biographies/ https://livingtongues.org/category/gregory-d-s-anderson/page/3/ And as an art and entertainment lawyer in the 1990s, Daulton developed the major-label rock band Kill Hannah, among other recording artists.A Conversation with Musician Mat Devine of Kill Hannah, Part 1, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn3IMAcqlAA&t;=11sA Conversation with Musician Mat Devine, Part 2, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cILG46x4M14  Education  Daulton received his B.S., with honors, from the University of California at Berkeley in 1978 and his J.D. from the UC Berkeley School of Law in 1981. Daulton later attended graduate school at Northern Illinois University where he studied the history of Southeast Asian art under the supervision of Professor Richard Cooler, then Director of the Center for Burma studies, and, having been awarded a FLAS fellowship,https://commons.lib.niu.edu/bitstream/handle/10843/16024/Mandala%2311-1992Fall.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y studied the Burmese language under the supervision of Professor Saya U Saw Tun. During his time at NIU, Daulton undertook fieldwork in Myanmar and India, researching, documenting, and publishing, in the Journal of Burma Studies, the story of the Relics of Sariputta and Moggallana, the Buddha's two chief disciples, at the Kaba Aye Pagoda in Yangon, Myanmar.Jack Daulton, \\"Sariputta and Moggallana in the Golden Land: The Relics of the Buddha's Chief Disciples at the Kaba Aye Pagoda,\\" The Journal of Burma Studies, Vol. 4, 1999, at 101-128, https://www.niu.edu/burma/publications/jbs/vol4/Abstract4_DaultonOpt.pdf  Legal Case Recovering Stolen Buddha  In 1991, an ancient Buddha statue from a Burmese temple was identified in a Sotheby's auction catalog by an NIU professor specializing in Burmese art, Dr. Richard Cooler. After the FBI tried unsuccessfully for 3 years to prove that the statue was stolen, they enlisted Dr. Cooler to help demonstrate the origins of the statue. Cooler contacted his former student, Daulton, both a specialist in Burmese art and a litigator, to represent Myanmar in the case. Daulton and Cooler were able to demonstrate that the statue, which had been broken off at the legs, matched up with the lower third of the statue that still stood in the temple in Myanmar. The national treasure was returned with great gratitude from the Burmese government.https://www.arcsinfo.org/news-events/entry/74/myanmar-buddha- sculpture-returns-home-after-wild-ridehttps://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia- Pacific/2013/1102/Myanmar-Buddha-sculpture-returns-home-after-wild-ride The case was highly publicized, a reflection of growing interest in the return of stolen ancient cultural properties to their countries of origin.\\"Turning the Wheel of the Law: The Quest to Recover the Image of the Standing Buddha,\\" documentary film directed by Lori Liggett and Laura Vazquez (Twisted Sisters Production, 1996)  The Daulton Collection  The Daulton Collection is an eclectic collection of art and artifacts from all over the world.

As a result of long-fought legalization efforts, several countries such as Uruguay and Canada, as well as several states in the US, have legalized the production, sale, possession, and recreational and/or medical usage of Cannabis. The broad legalization of Cannabis in this fashion can have numerous effects on the economy and society in which it is legalised. Region= Canada  See Cannabis in Canada. United States News report from Voice of America about businesses related to cannabis in the United States. Aired 23 September 2015A 2017 study found that the introduction of medical marijuana laws caused a reduction in violent crime in Americans states that border Mexico: \\"The reduction in crime is strongest for counties close to the border (less than 350km), and for crimes that relate to drug trafficking. In addition, we find that [medical marijuana laws] in inland states lead to a reduction in crime in the nearest border state. Our results are consistent with the theory that decriminalization of the production and distribution of marijuana leads to a reduction in violent crime in markets that are traditionally controlled by Mexican drug trafficking organisations.\\" =Colorado= News report by Voice of America about the business effect of cannabis in Colorado, with 700 million dollars in sales In Colorado, effects since 2014 include increased state revenues, violent crime decreased, and an increase in homeless population. One Colorado hospital has received a 15% increase in babies born with THC in their blood. Since legalization, public health and law enforcement officials in Colorado have grappled with a number of issues, serving as a model for policy problems that come with legalization. Marijuana-related hospital visits have nearly doubled between 2011, prior to legalization, and 2014. Top public health administrators in Colorado have cited the increased potency of today's infused products, often referred to as \\"edibles\\", as a cause for concern. They have also highlighted the risk that edibles pose to children, as they are often undistinguishable from ordinary foods once they are removed from their packaging. Youth usage has also been a major aspect of the debate surrounding marijuana legalization and a concern for state officials. Overall youth usage rates have increased, although not enough to be deemed statistically significant. Looking at students in the eighth, tenth, and twelfth grades, a survey study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that usage rates had not increased among any of the different age groups in Colorado, although statistically significant increases in usage rates amongst eighth and tenth graders were reported in Washington. =Oregon= Oregon legalized Cannabis in November 2014. Effects have included an increase in cannabis-related calls to the Oregon state poison center,https://public.health.oregon.gov/PreventionWellness/marijuana/Documents/oha-8509-marijuana- report.pdf an increase in perception among youth that Marijuana use is harmful, a decrease in arrest rates for cannabis related offenses, stores sold $250 million in cannabis products which resulted in $70 million in state tax revenue (higher than a predicted $36 million in revenue), 10% decrease in violent crime, and 13% drop in murder rate. =Washington D.C.= Washington D.C. legalized Cannabis in 2015. Cannabis possession arrests decreased 98% from 2014 to 2015 and all cannabis offenses dropped by 85%.

Cameron Woods is a remnant of what was a much larger stand of timber. It is shown on an 1837 vegetation plat map that was created by the General Land Office when Scott County was opened to settlement. The preserve features rolling hills whose slopes are covered with loess, which is generally found in the eastern section of the Southern Iowa Drift Plain. The land gradually descends north toward Hickory Creek. The preserve is covered by a hardwood forest that is dominated by red oak, but there are several white oak trees that are around 175 years old. It also contains spring flora such as bloodroot, Downy yellow violet, squirrel corn, columbine, and Starry False Solomon‚Äôs-seal. Birds found in the preserve include brown creeper, Baltimore orioles, rose-breasted grosbeak, song sparrow, as well as various warblers, and woodpeckers. Hunting is not allowed in the preserve. The Iowa Conservation Commission bought the property in 1977, and it was set aside as a biological state preserve the following year. A plant inventory in 2012 revealed that non-native plant species such as garlic mustard, amur honeysuckle, and nettles are invading the preserve.

He next won the Governor's Cup Futurity Trial on July 13 before placing second in the Governor's Cup Futurity on July 27. This was followed by two fifth place finishes in the Breeders' Futurity Trial and the Golden State Juvenile Invitational Trial before he rebounded with a win in the Golden State Juvenile Invitational. At the end of his two-year-old season, he placed fourth in the Los Alamitos Two Million Futurity Trial before winning the Los Alamitos Juvenile Invitational. He finished the year with a record of four wins and two seconds from ten starts. 2014: 3-year-old-season  Moonist started his three-year-old campaign by winning the Los Alamitos Winter Derby Trial on January 25, but finished fourth in the Grade I Los Alamitos Winter Derby. He then won the next eight straight races, including the G1 Golden State Derby on August 24 and two G3 events, the El Primero Del Ano Derby and Governors Cup Derby. His nine wins were the most of any Quarter Horse in 2014 and led to Moonist being named the AQHA champion three-year-old.  2015: 4-year-old- season  Moonist started the year by winning the Los Alamitos Winter Championship Trial on January 25, 2015 to extend his winning streak to nine. His qualifying time of 19.74 for 400 yards was the fastest in the Trials. Favored in the actual Los Alamitos Winter Championship on February 15, he was upset by Matabari, who had been the champion three-year-old filly of 2013 before losing her next five starts. Moonist then won three straight races, including the G3 Kaweah Bar Handicap on May 2. On July 5, he was the 1-10 favorite in the G1 Vessels Maturity but finished third to Far Niente and Well and Good after a poor break. \\"He was trying to beat the doors and he false fired,\\" said jockey Cesar De Alba. \\"He's done that before. He was moving back right when they kicked it and otherwise he's gone. He was coming on strong. Other than the false break he ran his race. He would have been 2nd with another step.\\" On July 25, Moonist rebounded with a win in the G1 Spencer L. Childers California Breeders Championship, winning by lengths over Well and Good. \\"Moonist is a once in a lifetime type of a horse,\\" said Hartley. \\"Without a doubt, he's just something very special. He always has his focus on running. He's very calm and he knows his business.\\" Moonist earned his tenth stakes victory and third G1 win in the Go Man Go Handicap on September 25, beating Separate Interest by lengths. He became only the 13th horse to earn 10 stake wins at Los Alamitos in its 64-year history. The win also earned Moonist a berth in the Champion of Champions, to be held at the end of the year. He followed up with a wire-to-wire victory in the G1 Robert L. Boniface Los Alamitos Invitational Championship on October 17, defeating Far Niente by half a length. The most prestigious race in Quarter Horse racing for older horses is the Champion of Champions. The 2015 renewal, held on December 15, featured a highly anticipated match-up between the top three-year-old, Heza Dasha Fire, and Moonist, the top older horse in the country. Heza Dasha Fire took the lead shortly after the break and held off Moonist to win by lengths. \\"I can‚Äôt knock that trip,\\" said Cooper. \\"We got outrun. I can live with it. That horse of Flores (Heza Dasha Fire) just went 440 yards in :21.20. There‚Äôs no shame in running second to a horse like that. That horse is just a fast horse and being younger didn't hurt him.\\" Moonist finished the year with seven wins, two seconds and a third from ten starts and was named the AQHA champion aged horse of 2015.  2016: 5-year-old-season  Moonist started the year by winning the Los Alamitos Winter Trial on January 24, 2016, defeating Heza Dasha Fire, who had just been named the 2015 World Champion Quarter Horse. In the Los Alamitos Winter Championship on February 14, he faced off once again with Heza Dasha Fire and again triumphed in a time of 19.49 seconds for 400 yards. Moonist was given a brief layoff, then returned with a \\"decisive\\" win in an allowance race on May 20, posting a time :17.466 seconds for 350 yards. On June 12, Moonist was the fastest qualifier in the Vessels Maturity Trials, completing the 400 yard race in :19.486. \\"Hopefully, he pulls up well after this race,\\" said Cooper. \\"That's always the next worry after they run. You don't have to do much with the good ones. We'll pony him a little bit and just take it real easy with him.\\"  Death  Moonist started to feel unwell on the afternoon of June 21 and quickly deteriorated from what turned out to be a bout of colic. Emergency surgery found bleeding in his organs that could not be helped. To prevent further suffering, Moonist was euthanized that evening. It was also only 9 days after his last victory in the Vessels Maturity Trial. There was a large outpouring from his fans. \\"My grandson was telling me about all the messages he was getting and seeing on social media about Moonist and it's quite overwhelming and touching to see how much this horse was liked and enjoyed by so many people,\\" said Hartley. \\"Moonist has been a member of our family and loved by so many in the horse racing family as well. Bonnie Vessels, who bred Moonist, was one of the first call me this morning after she heard the news. We've heard from so many people from all over the country. It's been touching. There'll never be another one like him for me. He‚Äôs one in two million.\\" He finished his career with 24 wins, including 12 stakes victories, from 34 starts and earnings of $878,468.

He is only known from an inscription in Eran, and a mention in the Manjushri-mula-kalpa. Only mentioned in the Eran inscription as a \\"Raja\\" and not a \\"Maharaja\\" or a \\"Maharajadhiraja\\" as would be customary for a Gupta Empire ruler, Bhanugupta may only have been a Governor for the region of Malwa, under Gupta Emperor Narasimhagupta. Eran inscription of Bhanugupta Bhanugupta is known from a stone pillar inscription in Eran, Malwa. The inscription was translated by John Faithfull Fleet in 1888, and then a second time in 1981, leading to different interpretations. Initial translation (J.F Fleet 1888) According to the initial translation of the Eran inscription (by John Faithful Fleet in 1888), Bhanugupta participated to a non-specific battle in 510 CE (Line 5). This translation was the basis for various conjectures about a possible encounter with Toramana, the Alchon Huns ruler. It has been suggested that Bhanugupta was involved in an important battle of his time, and suffered important losses, possibly against the Hun invader Toramana, whom he may or may not have defeated in 510.Ancient Indian History and Civilization by Sailendra Nath Sen p.220Encyclopaedia of Indian Events & Dates by S. B. Bhattacherje p.A15 Mookerji actually considers, in view of the inscription, that Bhanugupta was vanquished by Toramana at this 510 CE Eran battle, so that the western Gupta province of Malwa fell into the hands of the Hunas at that point. Toramana would then have made his Eran boar inscription, claiming control of the region. New translation (1981) A new revised translation was published in 1981. Verses 3-4 are markedly differently translated, in that ruler Bhanugupta and his chieftain or noble Goparaja are said to have participated in a battle against the \\"Maittras\\" in 510 CE, thought to be the Maitrakas (the reading being without full certainty, but \\"as good as certain\\" according to the authors). This would eliminate the suggestion that Bhanugupta alluded to a battle with Toramana in his inscription. Bhanugupta in the inscription is only mentioned as a \\"Raja\\" and not a \\"Maharaja\\" or a \\"Maharajadhiraja\\" as would be customary for a Gupta Empire ruler. Therefore he may only have been a Governor for the region of Malwa, under Gupta Emperor Narasimhagupta. The Gupta Empire, Radhakumud Mookerji, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 1959 p.120 Manjushri-mula-kalpa According to a 6th century CE Buddhist work, the Manjushri-mula-kalpa, \\"after the death of Budhagupta, two kings in Gupta line were crowned, one in Gauda and the other in Magadha\\", the latter being probably Narasimhagupta. According to this work, after Bhanu Gupta had lost Malwa, the Shudra Toramana continued his conquest to Magadha, forcing Narasimhagupta Baladitya to make a retreat to Bengal. Toramana is said to have crowned a new king in Benares, named Prakataditya, who is presented as a son of Narasimha Gupta.Early history of Jammu region, Raj Kumar, Gyan Publishing House, 2010 p.538 Toramana then died in Benares as he was returning westward.

The theatre, named after Michael Redgrave, had regular repertory seasons and also staged a variety of plays and musical productions until financial difficulties forced it to close. Now demolished, the surrounding site is under redevelopment. In January 2018, the Redgrave Theatre was finally approved for demolition. As of March 2019, the theatre is currently being demolished to make room for the \\"Brightwells Yard development\\". History and present day  A modern, purpose-built theatre designed by architect Frank Rutter, the Redgrave Theatre replaced the Castle Theatre in Farnham which had opened for Farnham Repertory Company in 1941, and which operated as a weekly repertory theatre. Eventually, Farnham Repertory Company outgrew its premises and moved to the newly built Redgrave Theatre in 1973. The first Artistic Director was Ian Mullins (1929‚Äì2014) from 1974 to 1977, followed by David Horlock from 1978 to 1979, Stephen Barry taking the position from 1982 to 1986, Patrick Sandford from 1986 to 1988, Graham Watkins from 1988 to 1994 and Roland Jaquarello from 1994 to 1995. Located in the town's East Street, the Redgrave Theatre was given the family name of actor Sir Michael Redgrave who inaugurated the start of the theatre's construction in September 1971. Judi Dench was among the founding members. The theatre officially opened on 29 May 1974 and commenced with a production of Romeo and Juliet attended by Princess Margaret. Princess Margaret returned to the theatre in 1984 to join the celebrations surrounding the Redgrave's tenth anniversary. She watched a performance of David and Jonathan which had been specially commissioned by local playwright William Douglas-Home and which had George Waring and Sean Bean in the cast.'Royal Night at the Redgrave: New Play for Tenth Birthday' ‚Äì Farnham Herald ‚Äì 15 June 1984 The Redgrave Theatre was mainly funded by the local community at a cost of ¬£260,000 and was built in the grounds of the Grade II listed Brightwell House, which dates to the 1790s, and is attached to the house itself. Brightwell House supplied a restaurant (the Castle Restaurant) and club room, with offices and dressing rooms above. The Redgrave Theatre was built with an orchestra pit for 10 musicians and with a stage equipped with a permanent revolve. The auditorium was a plain concrete structure, fan shaped in a single rake. The theatre's foyer was extended in 1986 but facilities were limited. Among those who appeared at the theatre were Zo√´ Wanamaker, Stephen Mangan, Fiona Fullerton, Prunella Scales, Tom Watt, Sandra Payne, Philippa Urquhart, David McAlister, Christopher Cazenove, Angharad Rees, Lisa Bowerman, George Waring, Sean Bean, Ian Bartholomew, Stephanie Turner, Gareth Thomas, Christopher Timothy, Maureen Lipman, James Bolam, Bernard Holley, David Hargreaves, Jack McKenzie, Simon Callow, William Gaunt and Rachel Kempson, the widow of Sir Michael Redgrave. The theatre company Cheek by Jowl premiered its production of As You Like It at the theatre in July 1991 before a run at the Lyric Theatre in Hammersmith.Production of As You Like It (1991) ‚Äì Cheek by Jowl website A 1991 production of The Seven Descents of Myrtle at the Redgrave starring Kit Hollerbach as Myrtle and Stephen Hattersley as Chicken led to Hattersley winning Best Actor 1991 in the TMA Awards for his performance. In 1981, the Redgrave Theatre staged the first revival of No√´l Coward's Cavalcade in a production directed by David Horlock (1942‚Äì1990) and with a cast of 12 professional actors and 300 amateur performers. The production was filmed by the BBC and shown in 1982 as a two-part documentary, Cavalcade ‚Äì A Backstage Story. Present day As of March 2019, the theatre is in the process of being demolished, this is to make way for the \\"Brightwells yard development‚Äù Whilst numerous attempts of protest was made to stop the theatre being demolished, it was eventually approved and the demolition is so far successful. Neglect The theatre entrance in 2016 The derelict Redgrave Theatre (left) and Brightwell House (right) in 2016 By the 1990s interest in repertory theatre had declined and after closing down completely for a period Waverley Borough Council took over the theatre and began to show films and to stage plays which did not appeal to local audiences.

The Farnham Theatre Association (FTA) campaigned to either save the theatre or have a similar venue built in the town. The proposed developer of the East Street site, Crest Nicholson, has said the scheme will help to revitalise an under-used part of the area and will see the creation of more than 200 homes and more than 800 new jobs. Full planning permission to develop the Brightwell House site was granted in 2008 in a scheme that included 239 residential units, a multi- screen cinema, together with retail and restaurant units. Listed building consent to demolish the Redgrave Theatre had been granted on two previous occasions, and both times it expired without implementation. In January 2015, permission was again given by Waverley Borough Council for the demolition of the theatre and conversion of Brightwell House, but campaigners again objected. The actor Simon Callow, who had appeared at the theatre, lent his support to the campaign to save it.Famous actor backs Redgrave ‚Äì Farnham Herald ‚Äì 6 May 2016 ReferencesExternal links *List of productions at the Redgrave Theatre ‚Äì Theatricalia website Category:Former theatres in England Category:1974 establishments in England Category:Farnham Category:Buildings and structures in Farnham Category:Theatres completed in 1974 Category:Theatres in Surrey Category:Buildings and structures in Surrey ","title":"Redgrave Theatre, Farnham"},{"id":"52134164","text":"Morning, also known as Morning Statue, is an outdoor sculpture by Donal Hord, installed at San Diego's Embarcadero Marina Park North, in the U.S. state of California.

History=Early history The Waagepetersen House visible to the far left in c. 1830 The house was built in 1792-1793 by Johan Martin Quist. Some of the early residents in the building included the author and economist Christen Pram in 1896 and Count Cai Friedrich Reventlow in 1798-1801. The Waagepetersen era Waagepetersen at his desk in his office in Store Strandstr√¶de The wine merchant Christian Petersen (later Christian Waagepetersen) acquired the building in 1811. He lived there with his large family and also ran his business from the premises. Tenants during his ownership included the physician Frederik Ludvig Bang who lived in the building from 1812 to 1814 and the composer, conductor and violinist Claus Schall lived in the building from 1822 to 1924 Waagepetersen had a passion for the arts and his home in Store Strandstr√¶de became a meetingplace for many of the leading figures of the Danish Golden Age in the 1820s and 1830s. He was especially fond of music as witnessed by the fact that he named three of his sons after Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. A music soir√©e painted by Wilhelm Marstrand The musicians Weyse, Kuhlau and Hartmann were frequent guests and often performed at music soir√©es. Other guests included the painters Eckersberg and Wilhelm Marstrand. Christian Waagepetersen died in 1840. The house in Store Strandstr√¶de was then taken over by Mazart Waagepetersen and his wife Charlotte Caroline Mathilde Waagepetersen. The couple's only child was Gaston Waagepetersen, an adopted son born outside marriage by Alce Tutein. Mazart Waagepetersen purchased the country house Tosendal in √òsterbro. Both properties were sold in 1878. The family then lived at Rosenv√¶ngets Side All√© 6 in √òsterbro. Later history The company De Forende Papirfabrikker A/S (The United Paper Mills) were based in the building from its foundation in 1889. The Danish state acquired the building in the early 1980s. In 1984-1986, it was adapted for use as a new home for Nordic Council by the architects Ib and J√∏rgen Rasmussen. Nordic Council moved out in 2010 after taking over Hotel Royal's former building at Ved Stranden. Architecture The building consists of three storeys and a cellar and is built to a somewhat unorthodox design. The three-bay median sisilit is decorated with four Ionic order pilsters on the two lower floors Above the pilasters, between the second and third floor, runs a Greek key frieze. The median risilit is not tipped by the usual triangular pediment but instead by a three bay wall dormer with a hip roof. Today The building was converted into 32 apartments in 2012, varying in size from 74 to 287 square metres. The two largest apartments has later been merged into one 474 square metre apartment by Joe & the Juice-founder Kasper Basse with the assistance of the architects Tom Lundberg og Stig Marvits. It was put on the market at a price of DKK 50 million in 2016. The building also contains three commercial tenancies. The wine bar Nabiolo has been located in the basement since May 2015.

Other definitions refine the meaning a bit more: * Flat big stone and of little thickness. * Flat stone, relatively thin, of rectangular form or almost rectangular.  In dolmens  Most dolmen constructions were built using stone slabs of big dimensions. Their architecture often includes a corridor of access that can be constructed using stone slabs or dry stones. The burial chamber, with variable shapes (e.g. rectangular, polygonal, oval, circular) can also be preceded by an anteroom. In some dolmens, the entrance has a door cut into one or more vertical stone slabs.

They can be employed for other uses, among them: * Balconies formed from a slab * Dry stone constructions of: walls, caves, rooms. * The base of some fireplaces are built with stone slabs (a big one or some smaller together). * In religious altars, the altar stone can be a stone slab, more or less elaborated or in its natural state. * In rustic tables. * Slate roofs are roofs which are made out of Slate slabs.

This use of slabs as tombstone has extended the concept of natural slab to the tombstone variant: flat, thin and polished. An instance is the slab in the tomb of King Pere el Gran of Aragon, which weighs 900 kg.Llosa de la tomba de Pere el Gran Such tombstones usually have inscriptions. This traditionally includes the name of the deceased, date of birth and/or death. The inscriptions are generally on a frontal side but also in some cases in the verso (on the top side) and around the edges. Some families commission or make an inscription on the underside. Some also have epitaphs: in praise (eulogies); citations of religious texts, such as \\"Requiescat in pace\\"; sentiments or quotations.

In primitive periods‚Äîbefore running water, washing machines and detergents‚Äîit was necessary to go to wash the clothes to the river bank or in a laundry room. Clothes were washed manually, by rubbing and sometimes striking them against a hard surface with soap. The aim was to do penetrate the mix of water and soap between the fibres of the fabric to pull-out the dirt. The slabs to wash the clothes were slabs of natural stone chosen to present a fine and relatively flat surface. The small rounded irregularities could help of friction in the washing process. * In some cases \\"artificial slabs\\" were made especially, in which the friction surface was wood, although the apparatus was still called \\"washing slab\\". * There were also \\"artificial slabs\\" made with an undulated steel sheet. (These type of washboards have been used as percussion instruments in jazz and blues bands).) * The wash to the stone of cowboys trousers and similar clothes is a stone washing process that uses the friction of some parts of the clothes against a coarse stone (or similar). The aim is to achieve a change of appearance of the clothes, imitating natural wear.  As hunting traps  Tunisian trap to hunt alive birds. A slab-trap is very much alike but more conclusive. Hunting with slabs is a system of hunting by means of a slab-trap. The fundamental part of the device is a slab. Preparing this trap was a delicate task. * Preparation of the trap: A slab of suitable dimensions is held in a raised position forming an appropriate angle with the horizontal. The slab, in unstable position, held in place by means of a few twigs or branches in a particular state, a state that can be called \\"ready to be triggered\\" (or at the trigger point). Once the slab is ready, one needs to put a suitable bait to attract the animal that wants to capture. * When the animal (e.g. bird, rabbit) tries to eat the bait, the slab falls on top of the animal and gets trapped (or crushed).

Constructed between 1777 and 1784, the Eider Canal was built to create a path for ships entering and exiting the Baltic that was shorter and less storm- prone than navigating around the Jutland peninsula. In the 1880s the canal was replaced by the enlarged Kiel Canal, which includes some of the Eider Canal's watercourse. Names The canal's watercourse followed the border between the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, and from the time of its construction it was known as the \\"Schleswig-Holstein Canal\\". After the First Schleswig War, the Danish government renamed the waterway the \\"Eider Canal\\" to resist the German nationalist idea of Schleswig-Holstein as a single political entity; but, when the region passed into Prussian control after the Second Schleswig War, the name was reverted to the \\"Schleswig-Holstein Canal.\\" In modern historiography the canal is referred to by either name. History As early as 1571 Duke Adolf I of Holstein-Gottorp proposed to build an artificial waterway across Schleswig-Holstein by connecting an eastward bend of the River Eider to the Baltic Sea, so as to compete with the nearby Stecknitz Canal for merchant traffic. At the time the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp was a vassal of the Kingdom of Denmark, but the dukes of Schleswig-Holstein were perennial enemies to their Danish suzerains, and the political fragmentation of the region and the ongoing conflict over its rightful rule posed an insurmountable obstacle to such a large project. The prospect of a canal was again raised in the 1600s under King Christian IV and Duke Frederick III. After the incorporation of Holstein into the Danish crown by the 1773 Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo, geopolitical conditions at last permitted a canal's construction and operation. Surveying and planning for the canal began in 1773, with a preliminary plan for the canal proposed in February 1774. On 14 April 1774, King Christian VII of Denmark issued a cabinet order establishing a Canal Commission to oversee the construction, led by Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann. Construction The canal's most easterly lock at Kiel-Holtenau in 1894 Preparations for the canal began in 1776 with dredging of the lower Eider between Friedrichstadt and Rendsburg. The artificial canal was then excavated and fitted with locks to allow ships to cross the peninsula's drainage divide and descend to the Kieler F√∂rde on the Baltic coast. Construction on the artificial segment, eventually long, began in July 1777 at Holtenau on the Baltic shore north of Kiel, proceeding to Knoop by the following autumn. This section partly followed the small river Levensau that emptied into the Kieler F√∂rde. The section from Knoop to Rathmannsdorf was built between 1778 and 1779, and the highest segment (connecting to the Flemhuder See) was completed in 1780. Finally, locks were installed along the upper Eider's natural course, starting at Rendsburg, to raise and deepen the river and make its upper reaches navigable as far as the western end of the artificial canal. Including of the Eider and a stretch passing through the Upper Eider Lakes at Rendsburg, the shipping route covered a total length of . Between the Baltic and the upper Eider there was a difference in elevation of about , which required the construction of six locks, located at Rendsburg, Kluvensiek, K√∂nigsf√∂rde, Rathmannsdorf, Knoop, and Holtenau (from west to east). All construction work was completed by the fall of 1784. Replacement by Kiel Canal The Eider Canal soon carried a considerable volume of shipping, and as decades passed the growing number and size of the ships wanting to make the crossing strained the canal's capacity. The winding course of the Eider and the need to navigate through the Frisian Islands at the canal's west end added to the travel time, and the drafts of late-nineteenth-century warships precluded their using the canal. In 1866 the Second Schleswig War resulted in Schleswig-Holstein's becoming part of Prussia, after which the German government explored a number of options for renovating or replacing the canal to improve commercial and military access to the Baltic. In 1887 Kaiser Wilhelm I inaugurated construction on a new canal through Schleswig-Holstein called the Kiel Canal. Though the new canal's western end is farther south (at the mouth of the Elbe), much of the Eider Canal's watercourse was reused for the new waterway. Many sections were deepened, and some were straightened, cutting off bends that still exist as lakes. The new canal was opened by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1895. Packing houses The Kiel-Holtenau packing house and commemorative obelisk In 1783, as part of the canal's development, three warehouses (called \\"packing houses\\" in German) were built along the watercourse: one at the Kiel- Holtenau lock, one at the Rendsburg lock, and one in the harbor area of T√∂nning. These structures allowed for the storage and handling of bulk goods transiting the canal, such as wool, cereals, coffee and salt. All three packing houses are made of bricks over a timber frame, with three full floors and an attic. The packing houses in Holtenau and T√∂nning are comparable in size, with approximately of floor space each; the Rendsburg packing house is substantially smaller than the other two. Course of the Canal The canal's eastern end was in the Kieler F√∂rde at the mouth of the river Levensau. The canal ran westward in the small river's natural bed to the first lock, by the Holtenau packing house, and on to the second, by Gut Knoop. At both of these sites there were pre-existing bridges across the Levensau. Then, for a short distance the canal separated from the Levensau to run northwest from Achtst√ºckenberg to the third lock at Rathmannsdorf, where the canal reached its maximum elevation of above sea level. The section of the canal from Knoop to the Rathmannsdorf lock has been preserved, with remains of the locks still standing. West of Rathmannsdorf the canal rejoined the riverbed of the Levensau and followed it westward until connecting with the Flemhuder See, which provided the reservoir of water for the operation of the canal's most elevated segment. From the Flemhuder See the canal proceeded westward to the south of Gut Rosenkranz until it came to a fourth lock at Klein K√∂nigsf√∂rde. From there it followed a long stretch of the Eider, a small detour northward from K√∂nigsf√∂rde to Gr√ºnhorst, and then a bend southward on Sehestedt to the fifth lock at Kluvensiek. The section from Klein K√∂nigsf√∂rde via Kluvensiek to Hohenfelde is still preserved today, along with remains of the lock system. From here the canal followed the Eider's natural river bed, flowing past Schirnau, Lehmbek, and Borgstedt before finally coming to Rendsburg where the sixth and final lock stood, along with a second packing house. From Rendsburg the waterway followed the natural river Eider down to its confluence with the North Sea at T√∂nning, where a third packing house was built. Specifications The artificial canal had a length of , a water-level width of , a bottom width of and a depth of , making a water-carrying cross- section of . Ships of up to length, width, draft and displacement were allowed to pass through the channel. A passage through the canal and along the Eider took three days or more; in unfavorable wind ships were drawn by horses on the accompanying towpaths. In more than one hundred years of operation, the canal was crossed by about 300,000 ships. Preservation The lock and drawbridge at Kluvensiek in 2013 Significant parts of the former Eider Canal, along with four of its locks, are now in protected areas as important elements of the historical and cultural landscape in Schleswig-Holstein. The Holtenau lock, the Rathmannsdorf lock by Altenholz, the lock at Klein K√∂nigsf√∂rde in Krummwisch, and the Kluvensiek lock in Bovenau (along with its drawbridge) are now under cultural monument protection. Segments of the old canal in Bovenau and in Altenholz have been designated as landscape conservation areas.

This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet Isaiah, and is one of the Book of the Prophets.J. D. Davis. 1960. A Dictionary of the Bible. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Book House.Theodore Hiebert, et al. 1996. The New Interpreter's Bible: Volume VI. Nashville: Abingdon. This chapter provides an introduction to the issues of sin, judgement, and hoped-for restoration which form the overarching structure of the whole book. It concludes (verse 31) with 'a reference to the burning of those who trust in their own strength', in a fire which cannot be 'quenched' (Heb. root: k-b-h), a relatively rare word which is also used in the last verse of the book (verse 66:24: 'their fire shall not be quenched'), thereby linking together beginning and ending of this whole book.  Text  The original text was written in Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 31 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls (3rd century BC or later): * 1QIsaa: complete * 4QIsaa (4Q55): extant: verses 1‚Äë3 * 4QIsab (4Q56): extant: verses 1‚Äë6 * 4QIsaf (4Q60): extant: verses 10‚Äë16, 18‚Äë31 * 4QIsaj (4Q63): extant: verses 1‚Äë6 There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE.

Verse 1 : The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. KJV * \\"Vision\\" (Hebrew: ◊ó◊ñ◊ï◊ü chƒÉz√¥n, from the verb, ◊ó◊ñ◊î ch√¢z√¢h, \\"to see, to behold\\"): Introducing the whole book as a vision in the title (see Obadiah 1, Nahum 1:1, Amos 1:1, Micah 1:1, Habakkuk 1:1), as well as in : Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold they are written in the vision of Isaiah. * \\"The son of Amoz\\": not of Amos the prophet. Jewish tradition has a note that Amoz, the father of Isaiah, was the brother of Amaziah, king of Judah, so that Isaiah was of the royal family.T. Bab.

NKJV The New Century Version combines these two exhortations into one: :Heaven and earth, listen, because the Lord is speaking. NCV Verse 3 :\\"The ox knows its owner, ::and the donkey its master's crib, :but Israel does not know, ::my people do not understand.\\" ESV This verse has played an important part in Christian Christmas tradition, along with a number of other verses in Isaiah which are treated as pointing forward to the time of Christ, and, although not mentioned in the gospels,DiPippo, G., The Ancient Origins of the Nativity Scene (Part 1), New Liturgical Movement, published 5 January 2012, accessed 23 November 2019 \\"the ox and the donkey/ass\\" are often connected with accounts of the birth of Jesus. The animals in the Christmas crib are first mentioned in the apocryphal Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew (dated to the eighth or ninth century CE), where it is said that Mary 'put her child in a manger, and an ox and an ass worshipped him. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: \\"The ox knows his owner and the ass his master's crib\\"'.Hennecke, E. (1963), New Testament Apocrypha (London: SCM), i. p. 410, apud Coggins 2007, p. 437 The devastation of Judah (1:5‚Äì9) Isaiah uses images of the sick individual (verses 5-6) and the desolate nation (verses 7-8) to portray the sinfulness of his nation. The \\"daughter of Zion\\" (i.e. the city of Jerusalem) remained an isolated stronghold when Sennacherib, king of Assyria attacked the fortified cities of Judah in 701 BCE. Pious corruption and its cleansing (1:10‚Äì20) Considered 'the most powerful and sustained' prophetic outburst at religious unreality (cf. ; ; ; ; ), the vehemence of this prophecy is built up together in its form and content. First, God rejected the offerings, then the offerers (verses 11‚Äì12), the specific accusation in the lurid conclusion of verse 15: Your hands are full of blood, followed by the command to 'have done with evil' in 'eight thunderous calls', ending in the reminder of the life-and-death alternatives similar to . Verse 11 :I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams :And the fat of fed cattle. :I do not delight in the blood of bulls, :Or of lambs or goats. NKJV Anglican bishop Robert Lowth translates as I am cloyed with the burnt offerings of rams ...Lowth, R., Isaiah: a new translation: with a preliminary dissertation, and notes, critical, philological and explanatory, Boston, W. Hilliard; Cambridge, J. Munroe and Company, 1834 According to the Torah, burnt offerings formed a part of the required sacrifice on all great occasions, as at the Passover (), at the Feast of Weeks (), at the Feast of Tabernacles (, , , 23, 26, 29, 32, 36), at the Feast of Trumpets (), and on the great Day of Atonement (), as well as being commanded as the sole sacrifice for a trespass offering (, 18). Verse 18 :Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: :: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; :: though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. KJV The phrase \\"reason together\\" has a tone of \\"legal argument\\"; similar wording appears in . God's lament and resolve (1:21‚Äì31) The theme of this part is the vanished glory as in a funeral dirge, lamenting the moral loss or justice, but not concerning the wealth. Verse 26 :\\"And I will restore your judges as at the first, ::and your counselors as at the beginning. :Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, ::the faithful city.\\" ESV The King James Version and American Standard Version speak of \\"judges\\" but the New International Version translates (shaphat) as \\"leaders\\". Verses 29-31 The Jerusalem Bible separates out verses 29-31 as an oracle \\"against tree worship\\", suggesting that the prophet \\"possibly has Samaria in mind\\".Jerusalem Bible, footnote at Isaiah 1:29 =Verse 29= :For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen. KJV *\\"Oaks\\", or \\"terebinths\\" (Pistacia palaestina), may refer to the \\"oaks\\" in . *\\"Which ye have desired\\" or \\"which give you such pleasure\\" =Verse 30= :For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water. KJV *\\"Garden\\": may refer to the \\"gardens\\" in . =Verse 31= :And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them. KJV *\\"Quench\\": Illusion of a fire (\\"spark\\") which cannot be 'quenched', from the Hebrew root: k-b-h (, kabah, \\"to be quenched or extinguished, to go out\\"), links this verse (the beginning chapter) to the last verse (of the ending chapter) of the whole book (Isaiah 66:24: 'their fire shall not be quenched'). Moreover, it is also used in three other places: (1) of the servant in 42:3, that 'a dimly burning wick (\\"smoking flax\\") he will not quench'; (2) that 'the fire devouring Edom \\"will not be quenched\\"' (34:10), and (3) those who oppose the LORD'S path are 'quenched like a wick' (43:17).

Background Palacci could see the Arc de Triomphe from his window (here, Victory parade of July 14, 1919, at Place de l'Etoile) Edmond Vita Palacci was born on February 9, 1931, in Paris. In the mid-1930s, he traveled with his family to Cairo, where they hoped his Egyptian-born father would recover from illness. In the summer of 1939, weeks before Nazi Germany invaded Poland, Palacci's mother sent him home to her parents in Paris. Occupied France Entrance to anti-semitic exposition Le Juif et la France (\\"The Jew and France\\"), Palais_Berlitz (1941-1942), which Palacci saw The German invasion of Poland in September 1939 marked the beginning of World War II. In Paris, his maternal grandfather decided the war would not last long and that his grandson should stay in Paris rather than return to Cairo, where his mother, father, and sister remained. When the Nazi attacked France in 1940, his grandparents fled south with him but soon returned to Paris. He experienced anti-semitism in school during the rest of the occupation. By 1942, he had to wear a yellow star in public. Seven members of his family were rounded up and deported to the Vel d'Hiv. French Resistance Francs- tireurs and Allied paratroopers reporting on situation during Battle of Normandy in 1944, which Palacci supported When the Gestapo started a hunt for Jews in Paris, his grandparents decided to hide Palacci on a farm in Les Essarts-le-Roi, near Rambouillet, outside Paris. He spent the rest of the war there (January‚ÄìSeptember 1944), where he wound up supporting the French Resistance, as detailed in his memoir. Palacci's interaction with the French Resistance began in June 1943 in Paris, when he overheard a secret \\"Ventriloque\\" (\\"Ventriloquist\\") transmission on a friend's crystal radio set. At Essarts-le-Roi, he discovered three officers‚ÄìBritish, Canadian, and American‚Äìon the scene to sabotage railway. They give him a nightly assignment: listen to Ventriloque for messages. Ignorant of their meaning, Palacci shared the messages with the officers. Over time, they gave him more specific instructions. Finally, in June 1944, they told him to listen for Paul Verlaine's poem \\"Chanson d'automne\\" (\\"Autumn Song\\"), whose first verse contained a signal. On June 5, he heard the second line started \\"Bercent mon c≈ìur d'une langueur monotone\\" (\\"Lull my heart with monotonous languor\\"): the original reads \\"Blessent mon c≈ìur d'une langueur monotone\\" (\\"Wound my heart with monotonous languor\\"). He noted the change to the officers, who went into action.. The next day, June 6, 1944, was D-Day, the first day of the Normandy landings. Career Arc de Triomphe, Paris. After the war, Palacci learned that during the war his father had died in Egypt and his maternal grandfather in Paris. His mother and then sister returned from Egypt and lived with his grandmother and him in Paris. He finished his schooling and university with a degree in chemical engineering (rubber and polymers). He started military service in 1954 and served in Algeria (1955-1956) as an officer. In 1957, he returned to Paris and worked as an engineer chemist in several plants. Rabbi Akiva Street, Tel Aviv, Israel. In 1960, he left with his wife to live in Israel. In Israel, he worked in chemical industries that included: tires, detergents, insecticides, industrial chemicals, buildings, and ecology. He also translated between Hebrew, French, and English and served as an ISO-9000 quality control consultant. His wife also worked in translation. In 1992, he published his memoir in Hebrew. From 1993 onwards, Palacci and wife were very active in \\"Aloumim\\" (children hidden in France). For some time, he served as the organization's vice-president. He strove for restitution to those French Jews interned in Nazi concentration camps during World War II. In 2013, he translated his memoir into French. He also wrote poems and articles for newspapers. Personal and death Street in Garden City, Cairo. Palacci's parents met in Paris at a wedding. His father, who was ill for much of his life, returned with his family to Garden City, Cairo, Egypt for warmer weather. He came from both Sephardic and Ashkenazi families: * Sephardic line: The Sephardic Palacci side of his family left Spain after the Alhambra Decree, wound up in Izmir and eventually Cairo. His grandfather Vita Palacci was a well-known department store owner. His father Isaac (\\"Izka\\" in his memoir) worked in exports and imports in support of his father's department store. * Ashkenazi line: The Ashkenazi Rossant branch came from Eastern Europe.

Critical reception The film received mixed-to-positive reviews, with critics praising the cinematography, music and directing, while a few criticized the writing. Ryan Jay of Premiere Radio Networks wrote a positive review, saying \\"It‚Äôs brilliant! The story is complete and fulfilling; such an impressive accomplishment. The cinematography is extraordinary and meticulous. It‚Äôs shot like it was backed by a major studio with a blockbuster budget.\\" Jacob Medel of Life in LA wrote that \\"OzLand is rich with detail and powerful character- driven storytelling. Written, produced and directed by Michael Williams, the film is a singular vision that follows Leif and Emri as they travel across a barren wasteland in search of a place to call home.\\" Katie Walsh of the Los Angeles Times wrote a mixed review, criticizing the writing but praising the cinematography and music, by writing \\"The bright, saturated cinematography and minimalist guitar-based score by Keatzi Gunmoney are the greatest strengths of OzLand, but they can't overcome the meandering story and stilted dialogue. The movie ‚Äî directed, written, produced, shot and edited by Michael Williams ‚Äî takes what could be an interesting concept for a short film and stretches it across 105 minutes. The ideas are not deep enough and the dramatic tension isn't real enough to sustain this feature.\\" Awards * Best Feature at Magnolia Independent Film Festival (2015) * Best Cinematography, Magnolia Independent Film Festival (2015) * Best of Show, Tupelo Film Festival (2015) * 1st Place Feature, Tupelo Film Festival (2015) * Elvin Whitesides Director's Award, Tupelo Film Festival (2015) * Best Feature Film, Real to Reel Film Festival (2015) * Best Narrative Feature, Offshoot Film Festival (2015) * Best Cinematography, FestivalSouth Film Expo (2015) ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2014 films Category:2010s drama films Category:2010s fantasy films Category:2014 independent films Category:2010s science fiction films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American science fantasy films Category:Films about novels Category:Films based on The Wizard of Oz Category:Films directed by Michael Williams (film director) Category:Films set in Kansas Category:Films shot in Kansas Category:Films shot in Mississippi Category:Oz (franchise) Category:Post-apocalyptic films Category:2014 directorial debut films Category:2014 drama films ","title":"OzLand"},{"id":"52134412","text":"Mark Tony Bantock is a former English international bowls player.

Jewish Encyclopedia This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet Zechariah, and is a part of the Book of the Twelve Minor Prophets. This chapter is a part of a section (so-called \\"Second Zechariah\\") consisting of Zechariah 9‚Äì14. This chapter and chapter 13 verses 1‚Äì6 are a section, forming a three-section \\"entity\\" with 13:7‚Äì9 and 14:1-21. Text The original text was written in the Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 14 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes the Codex Cairensis (from year 895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (930), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, including 4Q80 (4QXIIe; 75‚Äì50 BCE) with extant verses 7‚Äì12.Dead sea scrolls ‚Äì Zechariah and 4Q82 (4QXIIg; 50‚Äì25 BCE) with extant verses 1‚Äì3. There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: \\\\mathfrak{G}S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\\\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). Structure NKJV groups this chapter into: * = The Coming Deliverance of Judah * = Mourning for the Pierced One The Coming Deliverance of Judah (12:1‚Äì9) This section contains the oracle focusing on 'the final onslaught of all nations on Jerusalem.' Verse 1 :The burden of the word of the Lord against Israel. Thus says the Lord, who stretches out the heavens, lays the foundation of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him: NKJV *\\"Burden\\": here means \\"oracle\\" or \\"prophecy\\".Note [a] on Zechariah 12:1 in NKJV This verse contains the heading of the oracle which 'seems to cover the whole of the rest of the book' (chapters 12‚Äì14), with a 'doxology on creation' bringing ideas about \\"creation and origins\\" (the Urzeit) projected forwards onto the \\"end of time\\" (the Endzeit).  Mourning for the Pierced One (12:10‚Äì14) The mourning in this section is based on the piercing of Yahweh, who is the only one speaking in first person throughout chapters 12 to 14; first compared to the loss of an only (or firstborn) son (verse 10), then to the death of king Josiah in the \\"plain of Megiddo\\" (verse 11; cf. 2 Chronicles 35:20‚Äì25; 2 Kings 23:29‚Äì30; traced to Jeremiah in 2 Chronicles 35:25); and the mourning spreading from Jerusalem to the entire land (verse 12) following by the references to particular subgroups or clans in the community even further according to the gender (\\"wives\\" separated from the \\"husbands\\"; verses 12‚Äì14). Verse 10 * \\"They shall look upon me whom they have pierced\\" The speaker in first person is Yahweh (throughout chapters 12 to 14). To \\"look upon or unto\\" implies trust, longing, and reverence (compare ; ; ; ). For New Testament writers, the literal fulfilment of this piercing, i.e. slaying (; ) happened when the Romans crucified Jesus, such as Paul wrote about the crucifixion of \\"the Lord of glory\\" (), and requested the Ephesian elders to \\"feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood\\" (); also John () links these words to the same event (cf. Revelation 1:7). The Greek Septuagint renders , \\"They shall look to me because they insulted,\\" whereas Vulgate has Aspicient ad me quem confixerunt. A suffering Messiah was described earlier in Zechariah as a despised and ill-treated shepherd, and a little further on () that he is stricken with the sword. The prophecies of Isaiah have as well the same notion (Isaiah 53, etc.). With this notion the prophet, by inspiration, acknowledges the two natures in the one Person of Messiah, as Isaiah (Isaiah 9:6) called him the \\"Mighty God,\\" and the psalmists often speak to the same effect (; ; , etc.; cf. Micah 5:2). The \\"looking to\\" the stricken Messiah is signified when those watching the crucifixion beat their breasts (). * \\"Me ‚Ä¶ him\\": The change of person is due to Yahweh-Messiah speaking in His own person first, then the prophet speaking of \\"him\\". Later Jewish literature refers the \\"pierced\\" one to be Messiah Ben (son of) Joseph, who was to suffer in the battle with Gog, before Messiah Ben David should come to reign. Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic versions oppose this; and the ancient Jews interpreted it of Messiah. also refers to His being \\"pierced\\", just as in and Revelation 1:7, representing the act of the people (), and is so accounted here in Zechariah. The Hebrew word is always used of a literal piercing (so ).Jamieson, Robert; Fausset, Andrew Robert; Brown, David. Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown's Commentary On the Whole Bible. \\"Zechariah 12\\". 1871. * \\"As one mourneth for his only son... for his firstborn\\": The depth and poignancy of this mourning are expressed by a double comparison, the grief felt at the loss of an only son, and of the firstborn. Among the Hebrews the preservation of the family was deemed of vast importance, and its extinction regarded as a punishment and a curse, so that the death of an only son would be the heaviest blow that could happen (see ; ; ). Peculiar privileges belonged to the firstborn, and his loss would be estimated accordingly (see ; ; ; ). The mention of \\"piercing,\\" just above, seems to connect the passage with the Passover solemnities and the destruction of the firstborn of the Egyptians.Exell, Joseph S.; Spence-Jones, Henry Donald Maurice (Editors). On \\"Zechariah 12\\". In: The Pulpit Commentary. 23 volumes. First publication: 1890. Accessed 24 April 2019. * \\"In bitterness for him\\": as one that is \\"in bitterness for his firstborn\\".Gill, John. Exposition of the Entire Bible. \\"Zechariah 12\\". Published in 1746-1763. Verse 11 * \\"The mourning of (at) Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon\\": This is generally supposed to refer to the death of King Josiah of a wound received at Megiddo, in the battle with Pharaoh-Necho (609 BC), and to the national lamentation made for him, long observed on the anniversary of the calamity (see ; ). Jerome identified Hadadrimmon with a place in the Plain of Megiddo, near Jezreel, and known in his day by the name of Maximianopolis, now Rummaneh, seven miles northwest of Jezreel, on the southern edge of the Plain of Esdraelon, but the identification is far from certain. Verse 12 * \\"David... Nathan\\" First the royal family is mentioned generally, to show that no one, however, high in station, is exempted from this mourning; and then a particular branch is named to individualize the lamentation. Nathan is that son of David from whom descended Zerubbabel (; ). * \\"Nathan\\": A branch from Nathan, a son of David and whole brother of Solomon , in the ancestral line of Jesus ().Barnes, Albert. Notes on the Bible - Zechariah 12. James Murphy (ed). London: Blackie & Son, 1884. Reprint, Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1998. * \\"Their wives apart.\\" In private life the females of a household dwelt in apartments separate from the males, and in public functions the genders were equally kept distinct (see ; ; ; ). Verse 13 * \\"Levi... Shimei\\": The priestly family is generally mentioned first, and then individualized by naming Shimei, the son of Gershon, and grandson of Levi (). The LXX (Septuagint), Syriac Peshitta, and Arabic versions, read \\"the family of Simeon\\" or \\"the tribe of Simeon,\\" instead of \\"the family of Shimei,\\" but there is no known reason to mention this tribe. In one sense, this prophecy began to be fulfilled when a great company of priests were converted by the preaching of the apostles (). These names are also found in a branch from Nathan, a son of David and whole brother of Solomon (), which was in the ancestral line of Jesus (: \\"(23) Jesus... the son of Joseph,... (24) ... the son of Levi, ... (26) ...the son of Semei, ...(29) ... the son of Levi, ... (30) ... the son of Simeon, ... (31) ... the son of Nathan, which was the son of David\\").

The flight was operated by Kalitta Air and the aircraft was wet leased by Centurion Cargo. On 7 July 2008, the aircraft, a Boeing 747-209BSF registered as N714CK, crashed shortly after takeoff. All aboard suffered injuries, but none were killed. Two people on the ground were killed after the plane slammed into a farm. The crash was the second crash of a Boeing 747 in 2008 in Kalitta Air service, after a previous accident at Brussels in May. An investigation was launched by Colombian authorities and concluded that the crash was caused by dual engine failures. During its take- off section, the engine number 4 and number 1 suffered loss of power. The flight crews could not recover the plane, which subsequently crashed into a ranch house. Accident The aircraft took off from El Dorado International Airport to Miami International Airport carrying 8 crew and a cargo of flowers, as a chartered cargo flight. The flight was operated by Kalitta Air for Centurion Air Cargo as Flight 164. During its rotation, the Number 4 engine suffered a non-recoverable surge, causing it to lose power. It then declared emergency 20 seconds later reporting an engine fire in engine number 4 (outer right hand engine) and requested to return to runway 13R. Bogota Tower cleared the airplane for that return to and landing on 13R. The airplane initiated a left-hand turn as by the published engine out procedure. Just about 20 seconds after the loss of the number 4 engine, the number 1 engine somehow failed. By this time, the aircraft had lost its ability to climb and started to lose control. The crew quickly recognized that they no longer had the thrust necessary to get back to the airport and attempted an off-airport landing. A taxi driver fueling his car at the nearby petrol station said that the airplane hit the wires along the highway triggering sparks, before it impacted ground. The aircraft crashed at 03:57 local time. It skimmed over trees and crash landed, skidded along the field and slammed into a ranch house, killing 2 people, Pedro Suarez, 50, and his 13-year-old son Edwin. The aircraft then broke up into several sections. Rescuers immediately arrived at the crash site and evacuated the survivors. All eight crew members survived, but one was in critical condition. At least 5 people were seriously injured in the crash. Two crew members were treated at a Madrid hospital, while six others were sent to the Central Police Hospital in Bogota. Aircraft The aircraft involved in the crash (middle) while still in operation with China Airlines. The Korean Airlines aircraft parked beside it was shot down by the Soviet Union in 1983. The aircraft, a Boeing 747-209BSF, registered as N714CK, was a 27 years and 3 months old aircraft. It had a total airframe hours of 90.613 hours equipped with 4 Pratt and Whitney Canada engines with a MSN number of 519. Before it was sold to Kalitta Air, it was delivered to China Airlines in 1981 as B-1886. It then delivered to China Airlines Cargo as B-18753. Investigation The Colombian Grupo de Investigacion de Accidentes opened an investigation into the crash. The U.S National Transportation Safety Board sent five investigators to assist the Colombian investigation team. The Federal Aviation Administration, aircraft-maker Boeing Co. and engine-maker Pratt & Whitney also assisting the investigation. The 51-year-old captain Bryan Beebe (8,874 hours total, 2,874 hours on type) was pilot flying; the 49-year-old first officer Frank Holley (11,373 hours total, 2,853 hours on type) was pilot monitoring. The 59-year-old flight engineer Joseph Kendall had a total flying experience of 10,665 hours and 2,665 hours on type. Both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder were recovered and taken for an analysis. The aircraft was configured for takeoff with flaps at 10 degrees (the flaps remaining in that position until impact) with the engines at EPR between 1.69 and 1.72, when it accelerated through Vr (152 knots) and rotation was initiated. While the aircraft rotated the pitch went through 13 degrees nose up and the airspeed had already exceeded V2 (162 KIAS) when engine #4 lost power, the engine rolling down from about 1.7 EPR to 1.0 EPR within 2‚Äì3 seconds, the engine surged 4 times during that time. Engineers determined that the high-pressure turbine of engine #4, that had been installed during the last work shop visit in January 2008, was inefficient due to too large a blade tip clearance, the reduced chord and wear of leading edges of fan blades resulting in a loss of engine power estimated at 5.8%. The high altitude impaired stability and operatibility of the engine. Engine #1 then suffered a failure of the low-pressure turbine, which resulted in ejection of engine parts through the engine exhaust. The failure originated in the third stage of the LPT, engineers believe the failure started with the loss of a number of guide vanes or the loss of a large piece of outside air seal due to thermal damage. Although an overboost condition existed outside regular engine operation range, the application of such engine power for a short period of time should not have caused an engine failure. The exact cause of the engine failure could not be determined. Investigators noted that engine #2 suffered a rapid decline of EPR and recovery of EPR for five times, each lasting for about 2‚Äì3 seconds, the surges happening at 87 seconds, 33 seconds, 13 and 3 seconds before impact. Few minutes later, the aircraft crashed. On 22 August 2011, the investigation board finally published the final report. The crash was caused by the failure of two engines of the aircraft, specifically engine number 4 and engine number 1. The number 4 engine suffered a non-recoverable surge during the rotation. The aircraft then struggled to climb. As the flight crews were conducting the emergency procedure, the number 1 engine somehow failed. With two engines malfunctioning, the aircraft was unable to sustain flight in its configuration. It began to experience problems with a third engine, the inboard left-hand JT9D, which repeatedly surged.

At this campus, the university provides a total of 32 degree programs in engineering, health technologies, management, communication, psychology and applied sciences with a total of 37 majors. In the university's most recent polling, 97% of its graduates are employed or doing graduate studies within 6 months of completing a degree program.https://www.oit.edu/career- services/graduate-success Oregon Tech has been judged by PayScale to give the best return on investment (ROI) of any college in the state of Oregon, for both in- and out-of-state students. https://www.payscale.com/college- roi/state/Oregon History The original Oregon Institute of Technology campus on Old Fort Road. Oregon Tech was founded as the Oregon Vocational School on July 14, 1947 to train and re-educate returning World War II veterans. Under the direction of Winston Purvine, the first classes were held in a deactivated Marine Corps hospital three miles northeast of Klamath Falls. The following year, the school's title was changed to the Oregon Technical Institute. In the first school year, 1947-1948, veterans constituted 98 percent of student enrollment. By 1950, the figure was 75 percent. In that year, in response to the Korean War, the school received a contract for training soldiers in welding and warehouse management. In 1953, Associate degree programs in Surveying and Structural Engineering Technologies were first accredited by the Engineers Council for Professional Development. The campus was transferred to its current location in 1964, followed by another name change to the Oregon Institute of Technology in 1973. Academics For the Fall 2015 academic year, the university received about 2,000 freshman applications. In 2005, Oregon Tech introduced the first Bachelor of Science degree in Renewable Energy Engineering (REE) offered in North America. The new program uses electrical and mechanical engineering fundamentals in conjunction with upper-division coursework in renewable energy and energy systems. REE prepares students for careers in the energy sector, especially in relation to renewable energy. The Renewable Energy Engineering degree is offered in both Klamath Falls and Wilsonville. A Master's degree program is located at the Wilsonville campus.  Rankings and recognition  Oregon Tech earned a spot among 650 other four-year baccalaureate colleges in the Forbes 2012 America's Best Colleges list. Forbes in 2015 rated Oregon Tech #98 among all West Coast universities and considers it to be \\"innovative.\\" In 2020, U.S. News ranked it #6 in Regional Colleges West, #4 in Best Colleges for Veterans and #12 in Best Value Schools.  Campus  Klamath Falls campus in 2013. Purvine Hall The present Klamath Falls Oregon Tech campus overlooks Upper Klamath Lake, and is directly adjacent to Sky Lakes Medical Center. The physical location of the school often elicits a favorable response with its views of the lake and mountains. Newer buildings such as Purvine Hall, the Martha Anne Dow Center for Health Professions, the College Union, and the renovated Owens Hall embrace a modern, aesthetically appealing collegiate style. Oregon Tech has a residence hall adjacent to the College Union, often referred to as \\"The Castle\\" by students because of its concrete appearance and elevated placement. The university opened a second housing unit titled \\"The Sustainable Village,\\" or just \\"The Village,\\" adjacent to the original residence hall for the start of the fall term, in 2009. The Village features an apartment-style complex. Many students live off-campus in the residential area south of the college along North Eldorado Avenue, or elsewhere in Klamath Falls. Athletics Oregon Tech (OIT) teams, nicknamed athletically as the Owls, are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Cascade Collegiate Conference (CCC). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, track & field and volleyball. The mascot for Oregon Tech Athletics is the Hustlin' Owl and is a source of pride for many Tech students. Oregon Tech's traditional athletic nemesis is Southern Oregon University in Ashland, Oregon. The close proximity of the schools and alternate academic foci (science and technology at Oregon Tech, liberal arts at SOU) result in a natural rivalry between the two. thumb thumb Basketball Oregon Tech basketball has been consistently competitive in the CCC and at the national level, while earning a somewhat infamous reputation within the conference for its passionate crowds and rowdy student section. In March 2004, the Oregon Tech men's basketball team made school history by winning the NAIA Division II National Championship. They won the NAIA National Championship again in 2008 and 2012. In 2019, the Hustlin' Owls made another run in the NAIA National Tournament finishing as the runner- up to Spring Arbor in the championship game. The Owl's 2019 Tournament run included upsetting the #1 ranked team, and defending National Champion, Indiana Wesleyan 107-93 in the quarterfinals. In the Semifinal round, the Owls defeated conference foe College of Idaho 93-81 to advance to the title game. =National championships= The Oregon Tech men's basketball team won their first NAIA Division II National Championship against Bellevue University of Bellevue, Nebraska 81-72, on March 18, 2004. They won their second national title in a rematch exactly four years later, to the day, against the Bruins from Bellevue, 63-56 in 2008. In 2012 they won their third national title 63-46 against Northwood (FLa.). =Danny Miles= Men's basketball head coach Danny Miles retired after his 46th season at Oregon Tech and had accumulated a 1040-437 record (0.704). This record has earned him the rank of 3rd winningest coach in men's collegiate basketball history at a four-year institution (third to Mike Krzyzewski of Duke University 1071 wins, and Harry Statham of McKendree University with 1110 wins). In Miles' tenure at Oregon Tech, he achieved three nationals wins, one national runner-up, one national third place, two elite eights, 17 district or conference titles, seven district runners-up, and ten 30 win seasons. His team has ranked in the NAIA Division 1 or 2 top-20 on 30 occasions and averaged more than 23 wins per season. Miles earned his 800th win on December 8, 2006 with an 84-73 victory over George Fox University. Miles again, reached a benchmark win at 900 on February 13, 2010 against Southern Oregon University with a final score of 101-76. Danny Miles became just the second men‚Äôs basketball coach at a four- year level to reach 1,000 career victories on February 1, 2014 with a 71-51 victory over Corban University. Softball In 2011 Oregon Tech won their first ever NAIA Softball National Championship. Football Oregon Tech first fielded a football team in 1948. The school dropped the football team in 1992 due to budget cuts. Clubs and activities The university has many different clubs and activities on campus which operate under the umbrella of the school's student government organization, Associated Students of OIT (ASOIT). Among these are student chapters of professional societies, such as the American Society of Civil Engineers and American Dental Hygienists' Association, Alpha Sigma Alpha sorority, Phi Delta Theta fraternity, Engineers Without Borders, recreational activity programs, special interest groups, cultural awareness organizations, student media, and academic honor societies. Also, Oregon Tech's student chapter of the Society of Automotive Engineers competes in the annual SAE Mini Baja event. The Renewable Energy Engineering program also has a club open to all majors and is working toward becoming a chapter of the Association of Energy Engineers. The Oregon Tech Robotics Club invites students from many majors to collaborate on multidisciplinary robotics projects such as the MATE ROV competition and to support community members in technical projects.

He is an expert in the history of Buddhism and of Vietnam. He is a Buddhist and has lived in Paris since the 1950s. He is founder and President of Qu√™ Me: Action for Democracy in Vietnam and the Vietnam Committee on Human Rights, Director of the International Buddhist Information Bureau, and the Overseas Spokesman of the independent Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), which is currently banned in Vietnam. A specialist on human rights and religious freedom, he contributes frequently to reports and testimonies to the United Nations, U.S. Congress, and European Parliament. Early life and education Born in central Vietnam in 1938, he moved with his family to Hue when he was five years old. He was arrested, imprisoned, and tortured at the age of 11 for participating in the resistance movement for the independence of Vietnam. In 1955, he began studying in Paris. Initially he studied medicine, but then enrolled at the Sorbonne to study literature. Career=Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) From 1963 to 1970, he represented the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam abroad and worked actively in the nonviolent Buddhist movement for peace and freedom. Vietnam War During the Vietnam War, he described it as a conflict between \\"two groups of missionaries\\" in which the Vietnamese themselves did not have a voice. In August 1968, the New York Review of Books published a letter from Vo Van Ai about American aircraft dropping napalm on Saigon. Que Me Beginning in 1970, he worked in publishing in Paris. After the Vietnam War ended in 1975, he and several friends in Paris founded the magazine Que Me: Action for Democracy in Vietnam. First published in 1976, the magazine (whose title is the Vietnamese word for homeland) seeks to cover Vietnamese culture, to inform the public about human- rights problems in Communist Vietnam, and to spur international action. It circulates in Vietnamese communities worldwide and clandestinely in Vietnam. Critic of Communism After the end of the Vietnam war in 1975, he continued to monitor human rights abuses and violations of religious freedom in Vietnam. He played a key role in drawing world attention to human rights abuses under the country's Communist regime. He drew up the first comprehensive map of the country's 150 \\"re-education camps\\" (laogai), which housed over 800,000 prisoners. Vo Van Ai has described Communism as a \\"nihilistic\\" system built on negative aspects of Western philosophy that \\"produces a species of slavery,\\" which is to say \\"living according to the dreams of others and following the orders of others.\\" Communism drains human beings of creativity and destroys their relations with individuals, with the world, with other species, and with the universe. It always \\"degenerates into bloodsucking,\\" into \\"political hooliganism.\\" Vietnam Committee on Human Rights He is the founder and president of the Vietnam Committee on Human Rights, a Paris-based monitoring organisation that was established in 1976, Boat people In 1978 he helped initiate a campaign that rescued boat people who were fleeing Vietnam on the South China Sea. He found it frustrating that Western intellectuals and activists who had marched in the streets against U.S. involvement in Vietnam \\"remained silent as thousands of Vietnamese died in reeducation camps or drowned on the South China seas.\\" Critics of U.S. involvement in the war, he later wrote, \\"could not admit that the 'heroic' freedom fighters of yore had turned into tyrants, and the 'henchmen of US imperialists' were now the victims.\\" While Vo Van Ai recognized the boat people not as economic refugees but as refugees from totalitarianism, it was hard to convince Western leftists of this fact. He managed, however, to persuade a great many leading intellectuals in France and elsewhere to support his campaign for the boat people. The \\"Boat for Vietnam\\" Committee was officially established on November 27, 1978, and included such figues as Yves Montand, Brigitte Bardot, Simone Signoret, Raymond Aron, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Mstislav Rostropovich, and Eug√®ne Ionesco. The campaign helped transform the received thinking on European left. Books He has written 17 books of poetry and essays, in addition to studies on Buddhism and Vietnamese history. Governments and international organizations In addition to contributing to reports to the U.S. Congress, the United Nations, and the European Parliament, Vo Van Ai submits regular reports on human rights and religious freedom to the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. In 1998, he helped prepare Abdelfattah Amor, UN Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance, for a visit to Vietnam. He has also been involved in international campaigns to win support for prisoners of conscience in Vietnam and for the promotion of democracy in Vietnam. He has also testified at several US Congressional Hearings on religious freedom in Vietnam. Recent activities In 2009, Van Ai spoke at the Oslo Freedom Forum, and in 2011 spoke at The Asean People's Forum about the human rights situation in Vietnam. In October 2013, the Wall Street Journal ran an article by Vo Van Ai about Vietnam's \\"brutal crackdown on free speech,\\" which coincided with a major diplomatic offensive. In April 2014, the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed by Vo Van Ai in memory of activist Dinh Dang Dinh, who had recently died of medical neglect. Dinh had spent years in prison for his activism, during which time he had contracted cancer but been denied treatment. Other activities and memberships Van Ai is currently the Vice-President for Asia of the Paris-based International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH). He is also Director of the International Buddhist Information Bureau, and Overseas Spokesman of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam.

Opened in 1946 by the LNER, it was located in Glen Falloch on the Ardlui side of the viaduct, but reported out of use by around 1948.  History  The West Highland Railway opened the line to passengers on 7 August 1894; later it was operated by the North British Railway, until in 1923 it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway. In 1948 the line became part of the Scottish Region of British Railways following nationalisation. Glen Falloch Halt or Platform had a single platform and was opened by the LNER in 1946, but it closed around 1948. Records show that it was not opened as a standard railway station for the general public and it was not listed in the 1948 British Railways (Scottish Region) timetable. The RCAHMS refer to the halt as being temporary. Well built 'slab' of concrete construction and a gravel surface, the curved single platform remnants are still present. It had a name board reading 'Glen Falloch', a single lamp for lighting and a small shed was present as a shelter or store. A footpath ran from the halt to the Drovers Inn at Inverarnan. Loch Sloy scheme and the WWII Prisoner of War camp After World War II many German and Italian ex-prisoners stayed in Scotland, and it is recorded that a small prisoner of war (POW) camp had been located at Glen Falloch, where a lot of forestry work was carried out. German and Italian POWs had been involved in the early stages of the construction of the Sloy Hydro- Electric facility between Loch Sloy and Inveruglas, on the west bank of Loch Lomond. Construction at the Loch Sloy project began in May 1945, under the auspices of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board, and it was completed in 1949, dates that largely coincide with the known use of Glen Falloch Halt located near the old POW camp. Glen Falloch Halt may have been used by men building the aqueducts and tunnels that collected water from the Glen Falloch burns and carried it to Loch Sloy. The near by station of Inveruglas was a similar but larger station with sidings, a passing loop, etc and was built in connection with the Loch Sloy hydroelectric scheme. The prisoners-of-war were carried from Faslane Platform near Faslane Junction and Whistlefield to Inveruglas or Glen Falloch.

It was an offensive campaign waged by the Union's 6th Michigan, 9th Connecticut, 14th Maine, 24th Maine, 165th New York Zouaves, and 77th New York against the Confederate troops in order to rid the town of Confederate troops and to destroy the town's railroad bridge. Background On September 13‚Äì15, 1862, the 13th Connecticut, 12th Maine, and 26th Massachusetts conducted an Expedition to Pass Manchac and Ponchatoula led by Maj. George C. Strong against the 10th Arkansas Infantry Regiment and Confederate Home Guard under the command of Brig. Gen. M. Jeff Thompson. The Union objective of destroying the Manchac railroad was a success, along with the bridge over the Ponchatoula River and the 20 train cars. However when the Confederate forces regrouped Pvt. Elmore Dane of the 26th Massachusetts described it as such... > \\"Out of 125 men 40 were killed, wounded and missing, almost 50 percent of > our number.

Union headquarters at New Orleans were alarmed by an improbable invasion by \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson with 40,000 men.Bacon, Edward (1867). Among the Cotton Thieves. The Free Press Steam Book and Job Printing House. p. 50. The Union officers considered the swamps as the most likely approach.Bacon, Edward (1867). Among the Cotton Thieves. The Free Press Steam Book and Job Printing House. p. 51. A reconnaissance was ordered of Manchac Pass on the New Orleans, Jackson, & Greater Northern Railroad where it crossed at Jones Island. Union Officer Col. Langdon conducted a reconnaissance and found Confederates and \\"negroes\\" working on the north side of Manchac Pass, but he found no evidence of an approaching invasion. Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks issued orders to Col. Thomas S. Clark of the 6th Michigan to proceed to Manchac Pass. On March 21, 1863, Clark's 6th Michigan expedition left Camp Parapet and proceeded along the New Orleans, Jackson, and Greater Northern Railroad.Bacon, Edward (1867). Among the Cotton Thieves. The Free Press Steam Book and Job Printing House. p. 52. His orders were to proceed to South Manchac Pass, a journey of about 30 miles. An advanced detachment, led by Clark, proceeded ahead of the main body of troops. Around noon of the 22nd, Clark's main body had arrived at South Manchac Pass. There they waited for ships carrying the 165th New York. The steamships Savary and the Barrataria, an iron-clad gunboat, with three schooners in tow arrived in the evening.Bacon, Edward (1867). Among the Cotton Thieves. The Free Press Steam Book and Job Printing House. p. 55. The next day, Clark's 6th Michigan was embarked on the steamships and schooners, and Lt. Col. Abel Smith's 165th New York Zouaves proceeded north along the railroad. The 6th Michigan were to flank Ponchatoula as the 165th New York were to attack the town via railroad. As the troops began their movement, a storm gave way to a hurricane.Bacon, Edward (1867). Among the Cotton Thieves. The Free Press Steam Book and Job Printing House. p. 56. The hurricane soon dissipated as the steamships moved northwest on the Lake Maurepas. By evening, the steamships ceased all movement. The Savary ran aground before twilight, and the Barrataria continued up the Tickfaw River. The Confederates at Ponchatoula were alarmed by Union movements. Col. Horace H. Miller of the 20th Mississippi had been at Ponchatoula since 1862. Miller retreated and telegraphed Lt. Gen. Pemberton several times in which Miller requested reinforcements. Companies H & K of the 1st Mississippi Cavalry had been detached to Ponchatoula in December 1862. They were under the command of Miller and participated in the battle. Troops came from the 1st Choctaw Battalion, 14th Mississippi, and the 14th Mississippi Cavalry. The 1st Choctaw Battalion was organized in February at Newton Station, Mississippi. They were still electing officers and procuring material needs under the leadership of Maj. John W. Pierce. The 14th Mississippi Infantry Regiment was on guard duty at Jackson, Mississippi. The men were scattered about Jackson doing various tasks. The 14th Mississippi Cavalry was detached to both Osyka, Mississippi and Camp Moore near Tangipahoa, Louisiana. The 1st Choctaw Battalion and the 14th Mississippi Infantry Regiment were delayed by a down bridge at Brookhaven, Mississippi. The bridge was likely destroyed due to flooding by the recent hurricane.

Second day of battle Early morning on March 25, Pemberton notified Miller that a bridge near Brookhaven was down and told Miller that reinforcements will be delayed until the 26th. Miller acknowledged, at 5 a.m., Pemberton's letter. Citizens, who freely pass between the battle lines, brought reports that Confederate trains are bringing troops to Hammond, Louisiana. Clark ordered the main body of troops to a point three miles south of Ponchatoula along the railroad, and he left a body of 300 men as pickets in the town. A smaller picket was left at Ponchatoula Creek. Third day of battle At 3 p.m., Miller's Confederates begin their assault to re-take Ponchatoula. The main thrust of the attack was along the railroad. The 1st Choctaw Battalion, 1st Mississippi Cavalry Detachments, and the 14th Mississippi Cavalry Detachment led the assault. A skirmish continued at the burned out railroad bridge over the Ponchatoula Creek for an hour. At 4 p.m., Confederate troops flanked Union soldiers. The flanking troops may have been done by Indian scouts from the 1st Choctaw Battalion. The Union troop pickets retreated from Ponchatoula Creek as they are being chased by the Confederates. By 4:30 p.m. the Confederates have re- gained Ponchatoula. At sunset (c. 7 p.m.), the Confederate offensive ends. Ponchatoula was again in the hands of the Confederates. Aftermath The followings days saw the retreat of Clark's expedition back to Manchac Pass. Bacon wrote, \\"We were able to ascertain that the long time we had spent about Pontchitoula had not been unimproved by the enemy. They had gathered a force greatly outnumbering ours. They had artillery and cavalry, and a large band of Indians for swamp fighting.\\"Bacon, Edward (1867). Among the Cotton Thieves. The Free Press Steam Book and Job Printing House. p. 82. On March 27, Miller praised his troops. He wrote to Pemberton, \\"I cannot speak too highly of conduct of officers and men of this command.\\" Southern newspapers (The Memphis Daily Appeal, The True Delta, New Orleans Bee, and the Mobile News) reported that \\"We have learned that on Wednesday about 1500 Yankees made an incursion upon Ponchatoula, which was guarded by only 150 cavalry, so sudden was their advent that our men were obliged to run without their horses. They retreated about 30 miles, telegraphing at an intermediate station for reinforcements, which came the next day in the form of 1,200 of our Indian troops and run the Yankees back ...\\"New Orleans Bee, New Orleans, Tuesday, April 7, 1863, Vol. XVII, Whole No. 12,655, \\"Additional from Southern Sources.\\" On March 31, Col. Smith with a flag of truce met with Col. Miller regarding the return of stolen objects. Bacon wrote, \\"They are advancing. Col. Miller was there, and another colonel. They would hardly treat me civilly; they are terribly enraged against us.\\"Bacon, Edward (1867). Among the Cotton Thieves. The Free Press Steam Book and Job Printing House. p. 84. The number of Union troops included 400 of the 6th Michigan, 40 from the 14th Maine, 20 from the 24th Maine, 306 from the 165th New York Zouaves, 100 from the 177th New York, and 26 from the 9th Connecticut. The rebels had, in approximation, 120 of the 1st Choctaw Battalion, 40 of the 20th Mississippi, 60 of the 1st Mississippi Cavalry, 50 from the 14th Mississippi Cavalry (from Camp Moore, Louisiana and Osyka, Mississippi), and 100 from the 14th Mississippi. A large number of Indian soldiers deserted the 1st Choctaw Battalion when they were not paid for their services. Ponchatoula would be held by the Confederates until it was recaptured by Union forces in May 1863. Three companies from Texas, two companies from New York, and a company from Massachusetts made their way thru the forest and swamps toward Hammond, Louisiana during the night of May 11‚Äì12 of 1863. Colonel Edmund J. Davis of the 1st Texas Cavalry Regiment commanded the Union companies. Davis' advance was under the command of Captain Samuel T. Read of the 3rd Massachusetts Cavalry. On the morning of May 12, 1863, Read's men captured a number of prisoners, including some members from the disbanded 1st Choctaw Battalion. Davis' expedition was a success as the Confederacy would not be a major presence for the remainder of the war. War casualties Capt. Gadi Herren of Company H of the 1st Mississippi Cavalry would die in the Battle of Dallas (Georgia) on May 28, 1864.The Memphis Daily Appeal, Atlanta, Ga, Thursday, June 2, 1864, Vol. XV, No. 123, \\"List of Casualties.\\" References Ponchatoula Category:May 1863 events Category:1863 in Louisiana ","title":"Battle of Ponchatoula"},{"id":"52134703","text":"Dr William Seller FRSE PRCPE (9 November 1797‚Äì11 April 1869) was a Scottish physician and botanist.

The building, named The Founders Library in honor of the 17 men who founded Howard University, serves as the iconic symbol of the University. Designed by architect Albert Irvin Cassell, construction began in 1937 during the presidency of Mordecai Wyatt Johnson. As the second library built for the University, the cornerstone was laid on June 10, 1937, and the building was opened for service on January 3, 1939. Today, the library houses over 1 million volumes, the Channing Pollock Theater Collection, and is the home to the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center.  Location  The Founders Library is located on Howard University's main quad. It was constructed on the location of the University's first main building which housed many university departments and the original library. The campus is located in the Howard/Shaw Neighborhood of Washington, D.C. At the time of the library's construction, the neighborhood was home to numerous black luminaries. Carter G. Woodson, Nannie Helen Burroughs, Georgia Douglas Johnson, Mary McLeod Bethune and Mary Church Terrell, were a few of the residents who during their time, helped create the center of black intellectual life in Washington, D.C.  History  Planning Process Discussions related to building a state of the art library on the campus of Howard University began in 1929. In that year, the U.S. Congress appropriated $1 million for the construction of the library. At the time, the university's library collection was housed in the Carnegie Library also located on the main campus. Opened in 1910, the Carnegie Library allowed for the expansion the library collection and number of which facilitated easier usage of the collection. Prior to this period, the library collection was scattered between the main building and individual libraries in each college. By 1929, the collection had grown to over 85,000 volumes and continued expanding through yearly appropriations of $4,000. The building also housed the Moorland Collection of over 3000 documents related to African and African American history donated in 1914 by Howard Trustee and YMCA executive Jesse E. Moorland. Due to its continued growth, the Carnegie Library was strained by usage at the time. Thus, a new library was commissioned. Construction Although funds were appropriated for construction in 1929, construction did not begin until 1936. To accommodate its construction, the original main building on the campus was demolished. In addition, the President's house, which sat next to the main building was moved. Upon completion, Founders Library was described as a \\"palace of books\\" and was the most comprehensive library at any Historically Black College or University. Founders was dedication in May 1939. U.S. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, who was prominent in securing the funding for the library, said this of the importance of libraries: > We can hardly over-estimate the role of libraries in modern life. They > constitute perhaps the most important single agency for the perpetuation of > civilization. To the libraries we entrust for safe keeping our accumulated > social, artistic and scientific knowledge. It is upon their resources that > we largely depend for knowing and understand the past; it is by their help > that we may undertake to absorb the knowledge and develop the intellectual > habits necessary for effective participation in the democratic way of life; > and it is mainly through them that we hope to be able to project our own > contributions into and influence the future. Architecture The Founders Library is a Georgian style, red brick building with a clock tower visible throughout Washington, D.C. The building contained many of the most advanced technological advancements of the day including mechanical elevators and air conditioning. Founders Library cost $1.106 million in 1939 and was one of the most important academic structures of the 1940s. The library has five reading rooms. The main reading room is 120 feet (37 m) by 32 feet (9.8 m). A contemporary account by one of the leading architects in Albert Cassell's firm makes clear how the project began: The importance of the library was also recognized in 2012 by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as it named the library a \\"national treasure.\\"  Collections =Main library collection The main library uses consist in more than 40 thousand books organized using the Library of Congress Classification: Third floor * Class A ‚Äì General Works * Class B ‚Äì Philosophy.

The Charles Eaton Burch Collection An extensive collection of Eighteenth Century English Literature curated by former Howard University professors Charles E. Burch. Burch headed the Howard University English Department and received wide acclaim as a professor of 17th, 18th century English Literature. His major research concerned the literary and political activities of author Daniel Defoe. The Channing Pollock Theater Collection The Channing Pollock Theater Collection is a non-circulating special collection of the Howard University Libraries. Devoted to the performing arts, the Channing Pollock Collection was established in 1950 by Helen Channing Pollock, daughter of the late American playwright and critic, Channing Pollock. The collection was formally presented to Howard in May 1952 during the University's Festival of Fine Arts. The collection contains the playwright's published works, manuscripts, and personal correspondence with celebrities of his day. It also includes photographs, programs, broadsides, sheet music representing different phases of the theatrical and entertainment world, and extensive original clippings files that provide an historical sketch of the role and place of Black performers on the American stage, in movies, and on television. The collection's strengths are Shakespearean drama and criticism as well as English and American theater of the 19th century. The Moorland-Spingarn Research Center The Moorland‚ÄìSpingarn Research Center (MSRC) is recognized as one of the world's largest and most comprehensive repositories for the documentation of the history and culture of people of African descent in Africa, the Americas, and other parts of the world. The Moorland-Spingarn Research Center is located within the Founders Library.  Importance  As one of the most comprehensive libraries on a historically black college campus, the Founders Library has been a beacon of intellectual research and study of the African American experience. Housing Howard University's School of Law during the 1930s-1950s, many of the major achievements of that department's faculty were completed in the building. This included much of the work on the famed Brown v. Board of Topeka, Kansas case. The case, which originated with Charles Hamilton Houston, Dean of the Howard University School of Law, was eventually argued by Houston's former student and mentee, Thurgood Marshall, who later became an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court..

Elements of the regiment landed with special equipment on D-Day, and served in the Normandy campaign. The regiment went on to defend Belgian cities against V-1 flying bombs and participated in the assault crossing of the Rhine. Origin 93rd LAA Regiment was formed in November 1941 by converting the 8th Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire), a war service infantry battalion that had only been raised in the previous year as part of the rapid expansion of the British Army.Loyals at Regiments.orgJohn Downham, 'The Regiments in World War II' at Lancashire Infantry Museum.93 LAA Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45.Farndale, Annex M. 8th Loyals The 8th Bn Loyals was formed on 4 July 1940 at Ashton-under- Lyne, Lancashire, as a new unit. (A previous 8th Loyals had been a 'Kitchener's Army' battalion during World War I). The majority of the recruits were from Lancashire, particularly Liverpool, the officers from regiments in North West England (the commanding officer was Lieutenant-Colonel J. O'Sullivan of the Loyals), and the cadre of experienced non-commissioned officers and men was drawn from the Manchester Regiment's Machine Gun Training Centre at Ladysmith Barracks, Ashton-under-Lyne (who had to be re-trained in infantry work).Frederick, p. 192.8 Loyals War Diary, 1940, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 166/4446. The battalion assembled in camp at Caernarfon, joining the newly raised 7th and 9th Battalions of the Loyals which (together with 12th Battalion Royal Welch Fusiliers) constituted No 15 Infantry Training Group. In October 1940 the 15th ITG became 215th Independent Infantry Brigade (Home), a home defence formation.Joslen, p. 378. Training was hampered by the shortage of rifles and equipment, and the tented camp became uninhabitable during winter gales. In January 1941 the 8th Battalion relocated to billets in disused mills at Biddulph, with B Company at Huyton. In February the brigade transferred to the Durham and North Riding County Division in North East England, where it took up an operational role in beach defence. The 8th Battalion's headquarters (HQ) was at Saltburn-by-the-Sea and it took over the defences from Redcar Pier to Staithes. These included concrete pillboxes equipped with Vickers guns, for which the previous training of the battalion's original cadre was useful. The battalion moved to Shildon in County Durham in June and carried out exercises with 215 Bde along the River Tweed against Scottish Command before returning to Saltburn. 93rd LAA Regiment In November 1941, the county division and 215 Bde were disbanded. At this point the three battalions of the Loyals were converted from infantry to other roles: the 7th and 8th became the 92nd (Loyals) and 93rd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiments of the RA, while the 9th became 148th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps. The new 93rd LAA Regiment came into existence on 15 November, consisting of Regimental HQ (RHQ) and 320‚Äì322 LAA Batteries, still under the command of Lt- Col O'Sullivan. Cadres from 320 and 321 Btys went for retraining to 233rd LAA Training Rgt and 322 Bty to 212th LAA Training Rgt, both based at Saighton Camp, Chester, and the batteries then went to AA practice camps, while RHQ was established at Rugby.Frederick, pp. 804, 835.93 LAA Rgt War Diary 1941, TNA file WO 166/2764.93 LAA Rgt War Diary 1942, TNA file WO 166/7681. Surplus men were drafted on 26 November to 210th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Training Regiment at Oswestry where they joined a new 493 (Mixed) Heavy AA Bty that was being formed for 141st (Mixed) HAA Rgt ('Mixed' indicating that women from the Auxiliary Territorial Service were integrated into the unit's personnel).Frederick, p. 760. Bofors 40mm LAA gun In January 1942 the regiment moved to Waitwith Camp, Catterick Garrison,Waitwith Lines, Catterick, at Army Rumour Service. to join 42nd Support Group in 42nd Armoured Division, which had recently been converted from the 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division. Support Groups at the time consisted of a brigade of mobile field, anti-tank and LAA artillery together with lorried infantry, intended to support the armoured brigades of the division. The LAA regiment was equipped with Bofors 40 mm guns. However, the support group concept was soon scrapped and from 1 June 1942 the regiment served directly under the HQ RA of 42nd Armoured Division.Joslen, pp. 29 & 222. Mobile training was carried out at Rainham in Essex in April 1942 and field firing at No 16 LAA Practice Camp at Clacton-on- Sea in May and June. RHQ moved to Blenheim Terrace, Scarborough, in June, and then to Bridlington in November. When not training, LAA regiments often assisted Anti-Aircraft Command as part of Air Defence of Great Britain. In December 1942, 93rd LAA Rgt was deployed along the Sussex coast, which was subject to 'hit and run' raids by the Luftwaffe.Routledge, pp. 401‚Äì4. RHQ was at Hove, 320 Bty at Seaford and Pevensey, 321 Bty at Newhaven and 322 Bty at Eastbourne. A detachment of 322 Bty on Eastbourne Pier continued to man their gun even when the pier was damaged by a mine explosion. At the end of the year 322 Bty moved to Brighton, where on 29 March 1943 it opened fire at eight enemy aircraft and claimed one hit.93 LAA Rgt War Diary 1943, TNA file WO 166/11720. Training resumed in May, with 93rd LAA Rgt again going to Clacton and then on exercises with 42nd Armoured Division. Training for Overlord 42nd Armoured Division itself was disbanded in October 1943 and 93rd LAA Rgt served for a while in Suffolk and Kent with AA Command. Lieutenant-Colonel W.F. Holman took command of the regiment in November 1943 and it came under the control of 80th AA Brigade on 9 December. 80th AA Brigade was a mobile formation organised in Home Forces specifically for the planned invasion of Europe (Operation Overlord). The regiment was given a special assault role, equipped with 20 mm Oerlikon or the new 20 mm Polsten guns in triple mountings, half of them mounted on Crusader tank chassis.80 AA Bde War Diary 1943, TNA file WO 166/11248.Joslen, p. 583.80 AA Bde Operation Order No 1, 20 May 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085.Routledge, pp. 305‚Äì8. It joined 80th AA Bde at Oxted in Surrey at the beginning of January 1944, from where it sent subunits and personnel for battle training and practice in waterproofing vehicles, assault landing and tank driving. As a mobile unit it had its own Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) workshop attached. In April it moved to Rustington in Sussex, from where in mid-May the batteries were sent to the Overlord concentration areas in Hampshire.93 LAA Rgt War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 171/1124. D-Day For the Normandy landings, 80th AA Brigade was assigned to support I Corps landing on Juno and Sword Beaches, while 76th AA Brigade supported XXX Corps on Gold Beach. The leading elements were to land with the assault waves on D-Day itself (6 June). Light AA defence was emphasised at the start of the operation, since low-level attack by German aircraft was considered the most likely threat. The LAA regiments involved in the initial landings were on minimum scales of equipment, to be brought up to strength by parties arriving later. In the early phases, 93rd LAA Rgt's RHQ remained in England while its batteries were employed separately to supplement 40 mm defences:'M' & 'N' Assault Groups Operation Order No 1, 103 HAA and 73 LAA Rgt War Diaries, May 1944, TNA files WO 166/14783 and WO 171/1121. * 320 Bty (A, B and C Trps) was under command of 120th LAA Rgt (76th AA Bde) landing on Gold Beach * D Troop, 321 Bty, was part of 'O' AA Assault Group on Juno Beach under command of 114th LAA Rgt (80th AA Bde) landing on Mike Sector of Juno Beach * E Trp, 321 Bty, was part of 'P' AA Assault Group under command of 86th HAA Rgt (80th AA Bde) landing on Nan Sector of Juno Beach * F Trp, 321 Bty, remained in reserve offshore * G and H Trps, 322 Bty, were part of 'M' AA Assault Group under command of 73rd LAA Rgt (80th AA Bde) landing on Sword Beach * I Trp, 322 Bty, was part of 'N' AA Assault Group under command of 103rd HAA Rgt (80th AA Bde) landing on Sword Beach Each battery consisted of 18 triple 20 mm mountings, of which nine were mounted on Crusaders.

Since the early days after the landing, the batteries had been disposed with 320 Bty HQ at Asnelles with its detachments manning 20 mm guns on the 'Mulberry' piers under 76th AA Bde; 321 Bty HQ at Ouistreham, with D Tp at Courseulles-sur-Mer on the coast and E and F Tps defending the bridges across the River Orne and the Caen Canal, and 322 Bty HQ at Cresserons (under command of 73rd LAA Rgt), with H Tp on the coast at Petit-Enfer, and G and I Tps at the river and canal bridges. On 5 July one of 322 Bty's Crusaders was hit by shellfire, but the driver drove it clear. On 9 July, another Crusader of 322 Bty was drowned when the River Orne burst its banks. 322 Bty reverted to 93rd LAA command on 18 July. At the end of July, 320 Bty joined the rest of the regiment around the bridges, and in the last week of August 321 Bty was placed in direct support of 6th Airborne Division east of the Orne. During almost three months in the beachhead, the regiment's guns had shot down a sizeable but unknown number of enemy aircraft. North West Europe At the end of August, 21st Army Group broke out from the Normandy beachhead and began to pursue the defeated German troops across Northern France. AA defence of the beachhead became less important and 80th AA Bde could be released from its commitments there in order to follow the advance. 93rd LAA Regiment was left at the Caen Canal and came under first 75th AA Bde, and then 105th AA Bde, except 321 Bty, which spent 5‚Äì21 September at Le Havre protecting 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division's HQ. Shortly after returning to the regiment on the Caen Canal, 321 Bty was ordered forward to guard the bridges at Grave, Netherlands, (one Tp) and Nijmegen (two Tps), which had been captured during Operation Market Garden. These bridges were frequently attacked by air and by shelling, and the battery suffered some casualties. Meanwhile, the rest of the regiment had come under the control of 51st AA Defence HQ, responsible for air defence of the supply lines back to Normandy. RHQ was at Rouen, with 320 Bty guarding the river crossings of the Seine and 322 Bty deployed at Caen and Boulogne.Routledge, p. 317‚Äì20, 325; Table L, p. 327.Routledge, Table LI, pp. 328‚Äì9.93 LAA at RA Netherlands. For their work during the winter campaign in Belgium, several officers and men of the regiment were later awarded British or Belgian gallantry medals.Capt James Mitchell's citation, TNA file WO 373/111/876.Capt Robert Webster's citation, TNA file WO 373/111/899.Sjt Kenneth Parker's citation, TNA file WO 373/111/1121.Gnr John Bold's citation, TNA file WO 373/111/1301.Gnr Henry Clarke's citation, TNA file WO 373/111/1316. V-1 in flight over Antwerp In November, 322 Bty began to re-equip with Canadian Ford 4 x 4 three-tonner truck mountings for its triple 20 mm guns. By the end of the year, 322 Bty was deployed to the Siege of Dunkirk and 320 Bty was also completing its re- equipment, with part of C Trp joining the 'Brussels X' line defending that city against V-1 flying bombs (codenamed 'Divers'). By early 1945, the V-1 threat to Brussels had diminished and 93rd LAA's guns in the 'Brussels X' defences were switched to defending airfields.Routledge, p. 341. Captured V-1 displayed at Antwerp at the end of World War II. In January 1945, 320 Bty was deployed protecting airfields and then took over from 321 Bty at Nijmegen when that battery returned to Arras to re-equip. The batteries regularly moved from one brigade HQ to another as they were redeployed to protect different airfields. At the end of the month, RHQ, 320 Bty and 93 LAA Workshop were at Rixensart under 103 AA Bde, 321 Bty was defending airfields near Arras with 74 AA Bde and 322 Bty was with 107 AA Bde.93 LAA Rgt War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/4950. H Troop of 322 Bty was experimentally deployed under US Army command NE of Antwerp to tackle V-1s aimed at that vital port. Between 4 February and 15 March, Serjeant Albert Richardson's detachment destroyed nine V-1s, one of which exploded 50 yards from the gun position and caused damage. Serjeant Richardson was later awarded a US Bronze Star for his leadership and gallantry.Richardson's citation in TNA file WO 373/147/450. In February, Lt- Col Holman relinquished command of the regiment and was replaced by Lt-Col W. Odling, MC. Operation Plunder The regiment was heavily involved in the assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder). This began when 21st Army Group requisitioned transport vehicles from 75th and 76th AA Bdes to transport engineering equipment in preparation for the operation; 93rd LAA Rgt provided a small HQ and REME detachment for these units. Triple 20 mm LAA mounting on the bank of the Rhine, 25 March 1945. The regiment was given a special role in Operation Plunder because its truck mounts were the only LAA guns that could be ferried over the river on a Class 9 raft. In mid-March, the batteries were concentrated and reorganised on a light scale, similar to that adopted for the D-Day landings. The three batteries were divided among the three corps taking part in the operation:'Appendix A: OP PLUNDER: Report of the action of 93 LAA Regt RA on the crossing of the Rhine Mar 45', 93 LAA Rgt War Diary Mar 1945, TNA file WO 171/4950.Routledge, pp. 353‚Äì4; Table LVI, p. 365. * Tactical HQ and 321 Bty under 106 AA Bde supporting XXX Corps' crossing at Rees * 322 Bty under 100 AA Bde, supporting XII Corps' crossing at Xanten * 320 Bty (less one Trp at Nijmegen) later added to 107 AA Bde, supporting II Canadian Corps' crossing at Emmerich * Rear HQ remained at Rixensart 321 and 322 Batteries moved from their Belgian concentration areas and crossed the River Maas on the night of 19/20 March to enter their forward concentration areas hidden in woods. 320 Battery was added to the operation and given similar instructions. The assault crossing was to be made at night, but 322 Bty on XII Corps' front would be drawn up in the open in full moonlight. Consequently, it was shelled, mortared and machine gunned before the crossing even began, but the battery commander, Major John Frame, had carefully reconnoitred the position and deployed to minimise casualties; he was later awarded a Military Cross (MC).Frame's citation in TNA file WO 373/55/55. Half of the battery was rafted across during D-Day and set up on the east bank to protect the bridgehead. The battery had suffered 3 other ranks killed and one officer and 3 ORs wounded and had lost two SP vehicles (but not their triple mountings) to direct hits.Routledge, pp. 356‚Äì60. Captain Norman Wright, a troop commander in 322 Bty, was later awarded a MC for his leadership on this occasion and during the Diver deployment.Wright's citation in TNA file WO 373/55/78. XXX Corps was held up by strong opposition round Rees, and the priority was to get reinforcements, tanks and field guns across rather than AA guns. Luckily, the Luftwaffe was hardly seen during the night assaults or D-Day itself. Air attacks only began after dark on D-Day, and the LAA guns were effective in driving attacking aircraft up to heights where the HAA guns with their radar and predictors could deal with them. XXX Corps got its first bridges operational early on D+2, and 321 Bty immediately crossed to protect the east end. All the AA positions in the east bank had to be well dug in, with assistance from the Pioneer Corps. The two troops of 320 Bty deployed on 30/31 March to protect II Canadian Corps' work on the bridges at Emmerich.Routledge, Map 33. As 21st Army Group began its advance across Germany, most of 93rd LAA Rgt was sent back to Antwerp, but then returned to reoccupy its positions guarding the Rhine crossings from air or waterborne attack, though 320 Bty accompanied First Canadian Army in its final operations.Routledge, p. 360; Table LVII, p. 366. As the war drew to its close, the regiment became increasingly engaged in occupation duties. After VE Day the regiment concentrated at Xanten, the first time all subunits had been together for a year. Disbandment After the end of the war in Europe, 93rd LAA Rgt handed in its AA guns and came under command of 80th AA Bde at Eutin in Schleswig- Holstein, engaged in guarding and repatriating prisoners of war and displaced persons (Operation Clobber), and in internal security exercised through the Wehrmacht Control Police.80 AA Bde War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/4893.

He was a longtime member of the Democratic Progressive Party's New Tide faction. Education Lin earned a bachelor's degree at National Chengchi University. Political career Lin was an original member of the New Tide faction, a group within the Democratic Progressive Party formed by tangwai movement activists to oppose DPP politician Kang Ning-hsiang and later supportive of Chen Shui-bian. Lin helped write the party's founding charter. In 1998, it was suggested that the party platform be revised. Lin and Julian Kuo drafted an amendment delineating the DPP's acceptance of the Republic of China as the official name for Taiwan. By January 1999, it was decided that changes to the party platform would not be made. Lin was elected to the Legislative Yuan three times as a representative of Tainan 1. For a portion of his first term, Lin was the Democratic Progressive Party caucus whip. In 1999, the Ministry of the Interior proposed a law on referendums. Lin opposed the bill, because the MOI draft did not make Taiwanese sovereignty an issue eligible for referendum. He won the 2001 and 2004 legislative elections via party-list proportional representation. In July 2003, President Chen Shui-bian recommended that the Lungmen Nuclear Power Plant and Taiwan's membership in the World Trade Organization both be considered for referendum, a move Lin supported. When the Referendum Act was promulgated in December 2003, a referendum on cross-strait relations did indeed occur in March 2004. A \\"sunshine code\\" provision, which mandated the use of blind trusts for all members of the Executive Yuan and every overseas diplomat, passed in February 2006 with support from Lin. In June 2006, the Statute Governing Preferential Treatment for Retired Presidents and Vice Presidents was revised, lowering pensions for former leaders of Taiwan. Lin stated that the amendments were not adequate. Also that month, Lin asked Chiou I-jen to step down as claims of corruption within the Chen administration began. Lin had pledged to resign if Chen were detained, and gave up his seat on 13 November 2006, officially leaving the legislature on 15 November. Lin declared his candidacy for the legislative elections of 2008, and quit the race after winning only 11.01% of the vote in a party primary. Political stances Lin supports the Taiwan independence movement and believes that Cross-Strait relations are of an international nature. He often writes for the Taipei Times. Editorials authored for the publication have criticized increasing government bureaucracy, and the policies and actions of Ma Ying-jeou. Lin has written on party politics within the Democratic Progressive Party, and believes vice chairman positions within political parties contribute to bureaucracy. Lin has also expressed disapproval of the DPP, specifically targeting politicians Annette Lu and Yen Ching-chang. He supports pension reform, and expanding the investigative powers of the legislature and Control Yuan. Lin has covered the 1992 Consensus repeatedly, as well as Cross-Strait relations, and China itself in his writings. Lin's contributions to the Times further include political survey analysis and opinions on the use and meaning of national symbols.

Tsabari is a film director and a professor of film and television at Sapir Academic College. Tsabari directed 11 films and television series and won 6 Ophir Awards, Israel most prestigious film award. The television format of ‚ÄúConnected‚Äù, the docu-reality series he created with producer Ram Landes, was sold for production to 28 countries, including United States, Russia, China, England, France, Spain and Australia. Amir Ben-David is a writer, editor, journalist and musician. Ben David is currently the Chief Editor of Israel's Channel 10 morning show. Ben-David was the founder of ‚ÄúAvtipus‚Äù, a successful Israeli Rock band that rose to prominence in the mid-1990s. He also wrote lyrics and music for many other famous Israeli artists. On November 9, 2016, the series also won the \\"Outstanding Television Documentary Project\\" of The Israeli Documentary Filmmakers Forum for 2016. Each of the episodes is centered around Israeli figures who played key roles in the debate on Israel's economy and society: Guy Rolnik, Yaron Zelekha and Daniel (Danny) Gutwein. The documentary sought to re-ignite the interest in the issues that were raised four years earlier, in July 2011, when a wave of social justice protests erupted in Israel ‚Äì the biggest wave of protests Israel saw. Many of the ideas expressed by the protesters were developed and campaigned for by Rolnik and TheMarker, the newspaper he founded and of which he was the Editor-in-Chief. All three ‚Äì Rolnik, Gutwein and Zelekha ‚Äì continued to support the movement's ideas, even after the protests subsided. In A November 25, 2015 Bloomberg article, David Wainer wrote that ‚ÄúA wonkish TV show on Israel‚Äôs economy has struck a nerve in a country that usually reserves its fervor for debates about war and peace, giving new ammunition to opponents of government policies‚Äù, adding that ‚Äúabout one in eight Israelis tuned in to the three-part Silver Platter program, testimony to the depth of the discontent with the economy‚Äù and ‚ÄúSilver Platter has emerged as a cultural reference‚Äù. The series, which was the winner of the 2015 documentary series award of the Israeli Academy of Film and Television, was viewed on television and online by about a million Israelis, about two-thirds of the country's adults 20 years old and older. The series was aired on October 2015 by Israel's Channel 8 and was also made available for viewing online, where it became popular. As of September 2016, the first chapter alone was viewed about 555,000 times on YouTube.  Series content = Chapter 1, Guy Rolnik  The series‚Äô first chapter, which was the most viewed, focuses on the campaign Guy Rolnik has been waging since 2008 as the founder and Editor-in-Chief of TheMarker newspaper for economic and social reforms and against the concentration of economic and political power in the hands of a handful of tycoons who dominated Israel's economy. The chapter documents how, step-by-step, Rolnik, described in the chapter as ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs most influential economics and business journalist‚Äù, identified some of the biggest illnesses of the Israeli economy and then used TheMarker as a platform to change public discourse, which resulted in significant legislation and policy changes. ‚ÄúRolnik‚Äù, the documentary asserts, ‚Äúnot only reports on reality, he takes steps to change it. His articles have a huge effect on the public discourse.‚Äù Rolnik's best known battle was against the concentration of economic power in few hands, the poster-child of which was Nochi Dankner, which controlled IDB, Israel's biggest business conglomerate. Nochi Dankner and his cousin, Danny Dankner, who was the chairman of Israel's biggest bank, Bank Hapoalim, controlled a quarter of the country's financial assets. Rolnik's campaign resulted in a government-appointed committee against concentration, which led to a historic law, The Anti-Concentration Law, that forces break-ups of Israeli conglomerates and imposes many limitations on their ability to increase their economic power. According to the Silver Platter, a week after the bill was approved by an overwhelming bi-partisan majority in Israel's Knesset, Nochi Dankner lost control of IDB as it was sold by an Israeli court to new owners. Danny Dankner was indicted and convicted in two separate cases, one of which related to his activities at Bank Hapoalim, of obstructing the proper governance of a bank, bribery, money laundering and tax evasion. In both cases, he was sentenced to prison terms. Nochi Dankner, who was, for a decade, the most powerful businessman in Israel, was indicted, charged and convicted of securities-related issues. The conviction was related to a February 2012 share issue of his holding company, IDB. TheMarker was the newspaper that exposed the inner workings of the share issue immediately after it was completed and raised its suspicions. This battle resulted in a Government-appointed committee against concentration,http://mof.gov.il/Committees/PreviouslyCommittees/Pages/CompetitivenessCommittee.aspx which was followed by legislation.http://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/committees/Finance/News/Pages/9122013e.aspx ‚ÄúOne week later‚Äù, the chapter's narrator says, ‚ÄúNochi Dankner lost control in IDB and was dispossessed of his assets.‚Äù The documentary describes the campaign that Israel's tycoons waged against Rolnik. It describes the counter- campaign by most media outlets and by economists and experts hired by the tycoons to delegitimize the need for reform in Israel. The counter-campaign culminated in Nochi Dankner's takeover, in March 2011, of Maariv, Israel's second-largest newspaper at the time, as mouthpiece against Rolnik and the concentration committee. A February 4, 2015, documentary on Israel's Channel 1 revealed that after Nochi Dankner took over Maariv, he gave instructions to the newspapers‚Äô editors to go after Rolnik, and an Israeli NGO, the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, who fought for the breakup of concentration. Shortly thereafter, in December 2013, Rolnik was awarded the Sokolov Prize for Life Time Achievement (The Israeli Pulitzer). ‚ÄúIn his writing and work as the editor of TheMarker‚Äù, the prize committee member wrote, ‚ÄúRolnik proved that courageous journalism based on independent and unbiased thinking, in-depth investigation and financial knowledge can bring about change in society and the economy.‚Äù  Chapter 2, Yaron Zelekha  The series‚Äô second chapter is centered around Yaron Zelekha, Israel's former Chief Comptroller and later a whistle-blower. Zelekha also targets the Israeli public discourse, saying that it is deliberately veered away from economic and social issues and toward politics and intimidation. In the chapter, Zelekha asserts that Israel's poverty rate is among the Western World's highest even though it is not a poor country and that competitiveness is low, which pushes prices higher. Zelekha is filmed wandering through a supermarket's shelf demonstrating how an apparent variety of brands creates the impression of competition, which is false since most of these brands are produced by a handful of companies.  Chapter 3, Danny Gutwein  The final chapter is focused on Danny Gutwein, a professor at the University of Haifa‚Äôs Department of Jewish History. Gutwein publicly opposes privatization and promotes renationalization of formerly privatized services. In the episode, Gutwein compares between Finland, a Social Democratic state, and Israel. According to Gutwein, since 1977, the year when the Israeli right-wing party, the Likud, first came to power, Israel abandoned is Social-Democratic heritage, first by obliterating the old economy with hyperinflation and later privatization.  Media coverage  The series has attracted considerable media attention. In an October 25, 2015 article in Haaretz (Hebrew), television critic Shany Littman wrote that ‚ÄúDoron Tsabari and Amir Ben-David are providing Israeli citizens with a very valuable service. In three charismatic, clear and stirring lectures, combined with animation and interviews, they succeed in placing an important asset on Israel‚Äôs documentary films‚Äô shelf.‚Äù In an October 26, 2015 article in Maariv (Hebrew), Galit Edut interviewed the series‚Äô producer, Dana Cohen as saying: ‚Äú‚ÄôThe series does not attack anyone or personally. It does not attack groups either. Rather, we point our finger toward the system that lets them have their way‚Äô.‚Äù In an October 27, 2015 article in Walla! (Hebrew), Ilan Kaprov wrote that ‚ÄúThe Silver Platter‚Äù is ‚Äúone of the most important series ever viewed on Israeli screens‚Äù. He also wrote that the series ingredients ‚Äúhave to send us to the streets and push us to demand change. Now.‚Äù In an October 28, 2015 TimeOut article (Hebrew), television critic Amit Kling wrote that ‚Äúthe series‚Äô basic premise is essentially modernistic: we will fight ignorance, and this way the people will know who the bad guys are and take to the streets. But this is not the case and this is not the era that we live in. Those who want to be exposed to this information is already inundated with it.‚Äù In an October 28, 2015 Times of Israel article, Simona Weinglass wrote that ‚ÄúAt time when Israel is averaging several stabbing attacks or attempted attacks per day, it‚Äôs odd that a television show about the economy would capture the public imagination. But that is the feat of ‚ÄòSilver Platter‚Äô.‚Äù Weinglass added that the documentary ‚Äúis a devastating indictment of an economic system they say has grown so concentrated and extractive that Israel could soon rival countries like Rwanda and Namibia in its levels of corruption.‚Äù In her story, Weinglass also described the considerable discussion the series spawned on social media, especially Facebook and Twitter.  The Rolnik Report  Two years after ‚ÄúThe Silver Platter‚Äù, Rolnik and Tsabari cooperated again, this time in creating a highly critical documentary on Bank Hapoalim, Israel's biggest bank. The documentary, the total time of which is 53 minutes, was aired in five daily installments, between May 15, 2017 and May 19, 2017, during the first week of operation of Israel's recently launched Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, or ‚ÄúKan‚Äù. The installments were embedded in the main newscast of Kan. The documentary describes how some of the bank's owners, especially Nochi Dankner and his cousin Danny Dankner, used its resources and market power for their own good and for the good of a very small group of businesspeople and their interests. In one case, the bank continued to protect and provide credit to a member of the small group of businesspeople, Eliezer Fishman, years after he was apparently insolvent. It was the first time that a television channel broadcast such a critical story of such a big Israeli business entity. On May 22, 2017, an Israeli media watchdog, wrote about the documentary, which is described as the ‚Äúcrown jewel‚Äù of Kan's newscast: \\"Doron Tsabari‚Äôs and Guy Rolnik‚Äôs series is the main draw of the newscast, if not its only one. Rolnik repeats here the successful formula he used two years ago in 'The Silver Platter'... the series is riveting, educating, helpful and well presented (graphics, sound). It provides an important public service even though it feels like a campaign rather than an objective journalistic report. Rolnik, who is a guest in the newscast, has the energy and the journalistic charisma that one can wish will be a role model to the channel‚Äôs permanent staff.\\" References Category:Israeli television shows Category:Israeli documentary films Category:Israeli films ","title":"The Silver Platter"},{"id":"52134947","title":"Alina Serban"},{"id":"52134969","text":"The SC Scorpion is a Ukrainian single-place paraglider that was designed and produced by SC Paragliding of Kharkiv.

It provides a tailored interface for the service oriented towards music streaming, allowing users to browse through songs and music videos on YouTube based on genres, playlists, and recommendations. The service also offers a premium tier, which enables ad-free playback, audio-only background playback, and downloading songs for offline playback. These subscription benefits are also offered to subscribers of Google Play Music and YouTube Premium. The service will eventually supplant Google Play Music as Google's main brand for music streaming and purchase. History The YouTube Music app was unveiled in October 2015 and released the following month; its release came alongside the unveiling of YouTube Red, a larger subscription service that covers the entirety of the YouTube platform, including the Music app. Although redundant to Google's existing Google Play Music All Access subscription service, the app is designed for users who primarily consume music through YouTube. On May 17, 2018, YouTube announced a new version of the YouTube Music service, including a web-based desktop player and redesigned mobile app, more dynamic recommendations based on various factors, and use of Google artificial intelligence technology to search songs based on lyrics and descriptions. In addition, YouTube Music became a separate subscription service (positioned as a more direct competitor to Apple Music and Spotify), offering ad-free and background/audio-only streaming, and downloading for offline playback, for music content on YouTube. The service's benefits will continue to be available as part of the existing YouTube Premium (formerly YouTube Red) service, and to Google Play Music All Access subscribers. The YouTube Music subscription is priced in line with its competitors at US$9.99 per-month; the price of YouTube Premium was concurrently increased to $11.99 for new subscribers. In 2018, YouTube Music reached multiple sponsorship agreements with Dick Clark Productions to serve as a partner for its television specials Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve and the American Music Awards. YouTube Music became available on Google Assistant smart speakers (including Google Home) on April 18, 2019, with feature-limited ad-supported playback available for non-subscribers. Features The availability of music includes many of the releases from mainstream artists and extends to any video categorized as music on the YouTube service. YouTube Music will initially operate in parallel with Google Play Music, but the latter is scheduled to shut down entirely by December 2020. Product manager Elias Roman stated in 2018 that they aimed to reach feature parity with Google Play Music before migrating users to it. In September 2019, YouTube Music replaced Google Play Music in the core Google mobile services bundle distributed on new Android devices. In May 2020, an update was released to allow imports from Google Play Music, including purchased music, playlists, cloud libraries, and recommendations. The service still contains regressions over Google Play Music, including no online music store functionality (cannot purchase songs), and a YouTube Music Premium subscription being required in order to cast cloud library speakers to Google Home smart speakers. Google stated that they planned to address this and other \\"gaps\\" in features between the services before Play Music is shut down. A \\"pre-save\\" feature for upcoming releases was added in May 2020. Subscriptions The free tier usually plays songs in its versions of music video where applicable. The premium tier plays official tracks of the album, unless the user searches for the music video version. YouTube Music Premium subscribers are able to switch to an audio-only mode that can play in the background while the application is not in use.

She was the creator of a beer recipe which became the basis for founding Canada's oldest independent brewery, Moosehead Brewery. Though she was credited with running the operation as well as acting as chief brewer, the business was incorporated in the name of her husband and sons. When her husband died, the partners sold their interests to a manager, whom Oland was able to buy out eight years later. She continued running the business until her death. Early life Susannah Woodhouse Culverwell was born 7 February 1818 in West Monkton, Somerset, England, to Betty (n√©e Grabham) and George Woodhouse Culverwell. In 1841, she was living in the household of Samuel and Ann Mogg. On 26 September 1842 at St. Stephen's Church in Bristol, of Gloucestershire, England, Culverwell married John James Dunn Oland (1819-1870). The couple had nine children: Susannah Elizabeth (1843-1918), John Athelston (1844-1849), Charles Egbert (1846-1846), Ethelred Henry (1847-1899), John Culverwell (1849-1937), Conrad George (1851-1917), Huldah Sarah (1853-1933), Mary Stephens (1854-1945) and George Woodhouse Culverwell (1856-1933). Career John supposedly studied as an Anglican minister at Cambridge, but worked as a tobacconist and a dealer in tea and beer in Bristol after he and Susannah married. He filed bankruptcy in 1844, and then studied accounting, going to work at the London and South Western Railway. By 1851, the family had reestablished themselves sufficiently to hire a servant girl and a nurse, and were living in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, England. A decade later, the family of nine was farming near Hawley, by Farnborough, Surrey (now in Hampshire), England. In 1862, John immigrated to Nova Scotia, Canada, leaving Susannah to tend the farm and family. He was employed with the Nova Scotia Railway, a part of the intercontinental railway project and she brewed beer. Within three years, the family was reunited and rented a house in Dartmouth, where Susannah set up her brewing operation in the garden shed behind their home. Captain Francis de Winton, a friend of the family, suggested that they market Susannah's \\"Brown October Ale\\" and John, whose time with the railroad had ended, agreed. On 14 August 1867 the business was incorporated with John designated as manager, places set aside for three of his sons, with funds provided by de Winton, George Harvey and Thomas Mowbray. Though Susannah was the chief brewer and had been the inspiration for the business, her name was not on the agreement. Because they started the business in the Turtle Grove District of Dartmouth, it was called the Turtle Grove Brewery. Within a short time, there were nine employees and the business was the third largest operating in Dartmouth. John's name may have been on the paperwork, but Susannah ran the business. When John died in a riding accident on 20 October 1870 Oland was left with no control over the brewery. Compounding matters, de Winton had been transferred to Gibraltar and the other two partners sold their interests to a manager, George Fraser, who had formerly been employed with a competing firm. Undaunted, Oland continued working at the brewery, which had been renamed the \\"Army and Navy Brewery\\", in honor of her biggest patrons. For eight years, the business operated under that name, though it was destroyed and rebuilt twice because of fire. In 1877, after receiving an inheritance from a relative in England, Oland bought out Fraser and published a notice of the partnership's dissolution in a Halifax newspaper. She began operating the brewery under the gender neutral name, \\"S. Oland, Sons and Company\\", training her sons to be brewmasters. For the remainder of her life, she worked at the brewery; she is the only woman to have run the business. Death and legacy Oland died while spending the winter in Richmond, Virginia, on 24 March 1885. After her death, as her will had stipulated, control did not pass to her eldest sons, but rather to her youngest son, George, with provisions made for her daughter Hulda. The business she drove to be incorporated just 90 days after Canada's Confederation spawned two brewing dynasties in Canada, as after the 1917 Halifax explosion one branch of the family moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, later selling the Oland Brewery to Labatt Brewing Company, while the original company relocated to Halifax and later to Saint John. After several name changes, it became the Moosehead Brewery in 1947. It is the oldest independently operating and the largest privately-owned brewery in Canada.

Vaile was a prominent figure in Independence business and social circles, and \\"desired a magnificent residence as an outward expression of his wealth.\\" Construction began around 1871, and the mansion was completed in 1881, at a cost of $150,000 (the equivalent of about $3‚Äì4 million in 2020, when adjusted for inflation). The Vaile Mansion quickly became the showplace of Jackson County, and offered \\"lavish hospitality to notables of the 1880s and 1890s including many U.S. Senators and congressional representatives.\\" In the early 1880s Vaile was involved in the Star route scandal. Charged with defrauding the government, he faced two trials, in 1882 and 1883: both of them ended in a not guilty verdict, but Vaile had to spend more than $100,000 in trial expenses. In February 1883, while he was in Washington, D.C., his wife Sophia, who had been diagnosed with stomach cancer, was found dead at home from a morphine overdose, in what was a case of suspected suicide.Walker, Steve; Smith, Liz; Smarsh, Sarah (May 8, 2003).

State-of-the-art amenities original to the house include speaking tubes, gasoliers, indoor running hot and cold water, and flush toilets; equipped with a built-in 6,000 gallon water tank, the Vaile Mansion was the first house in Jackson County with indoor plumbing. The mansion was originally surrounded by a 630-acre estate (now reduced to a mere 5.6 acres), which included a grape vineyard and an apple orchard. Vaile had a wine processing plant on his property, as well as a wine cellar capable of holding 48,000 gallons.

From the range derived some buses. History and technical details The Renault commercial vehicles for 1936 adopted the styling of its passenger cars, with a curved cabin, a V-shaped, angled grille extending below the bonnet and horizontal slits on the sides of the engine compartment. Renault ADV The Renault ADV is a light truck produced between 1936 and 1938. It has a 0.5 tonnes payload and replaced the Renault YN commercial version. Its engine is a 1.46-litre inline-four petrol unit also used by its predecessor and the Renault Celtaquatre. At first, the engine had a power output of at 3,350 rpm, increased in 1937 to at 3,400 rpm. The wheelbase is , the width and the length . The gearbox is a 3-speed manual unit. The suspension is made of longitudinal springs on front and transversal springs on rear. The dampers are hydraulic on both front and rear. Renault produced a version adapted for right-hand drive markets, mainly the UK, called ADV2. The ADV was sold at in France, it was cheaper that its equivalent from Citro√´n (which was priced at ) and it was also slightly more capable. Renaults ADZ, ACZ and ADK A Renault ACZ The Renaults ADZ, ACZ and ADK are closely related light trucks that replaced the KZ, OS and PR ranges. The three models have a 2.38-litre inline-four petrol engine codenamed 85 (the engine would be used on Renault light commercial vehicles until the 1950s). The engine's power output is at 3,000 rpm. The clutch is a manually- operated single disc unit. The ACZ and the ADK has double wheels on the rear and a suspension designed for heavier loads than the used on the ADZ. The ADK was the only with servomechanical brakes. The ACZ and the ADK had a 4-speed manual transmission and the ADZ a 3-speed manual. The ADZ has a version for right-hand drive markets called ADZ2. The ADZ has a payload of 0.8 tonnes, the ACZ of 1.3 tonnes, the ADK of 2 tonnes. The ACZ was produced between 1935 and 1939. The ADZ was produced between 1936 and 1937 and was replaced by the AFR. The ADK was produced between 1936 and 1938 and was replaced by the AGC. Renault ADH The Renault ADH is a light truck with a payload between 1 and 2.5 tonnes. Its engines are a 4-litre inline-four petrol unit with a power output of at 2,200 rpm and a 4.3-litre inline-four diesel (ADHD) with a power output of at 1,800 rpm. It has a 4-speed manual gearbox. The truck was offered in long and short version. For military use, it was mainly produced using the short version, having a wheelbase, a length and a width. The military version of the ADH has a less powerful petrol engine than the civilian ( at 2,350 rpm) and a 5-speed gearbox. In 1940, the ADH replaced its \\"aerodynamic\\" grille for a simpler rectangular one. Renault ADR The Renault ADR was the last Renault truck that was non-forward control on the 3.5 payload class. The civilian version has two engines: a 4-litre inline-four petrol unit with a power output of at 2,200 rpm and a 4.3-litre inline-four diesel (ADRD) with a power output of at 1,800 rpm. It has a 4-speed manual gearbox. The truck was replaced by the AGR. Buses ADJ and ADN The Renault ADN is a bus/coach using the 2.38-litre engine of the ADZ/ACZ/ADK family which is able to transport up to 14 passengers. The ADJ is also a bus/coach which could be fitted with either a 4-litre petrol or a 4.7-litre diesel engine. It can carry up to 23 passengers. Heavy vehicles The 6.5-tonne payload ADS and the 7.5-tonne ADT are two forward control heavy trucks for 1937 not related to the rest of the range. They were unveiled at the 1936 Paris Salon and both were powered by a 12.5-litre diesel engine. They were replaced by the similarly- looking AGx range from late 1937.

Childhood and Early Life  Ighilahriz was born in Oujda to a Berber family and her family moved to Algiers in 1948. Through she was born in Morocco, the Ighilahriz family originated from the Kabylie region of Algeria, whose Berber tribes had been some of the most fiercest opponents of French rule in Algeria. Ighilahriz \\"describes herself as coming from a whole family of nationalists,\\" calling her mother \\"illiterate but hyperpoliticised\\" and saying that her maternal grandfather clandestinely manufactured guns for \\"revolutionaries.\\" When hearing upon the beginning of the Algerian War on 1 November 1954, her father, who worked as a baker, told her: \\"It is the end of the humiliation\\".Thomas, Martin Fight or Flight: Britain, France, and their Roads from Empire, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014 page xi.  FLN Involvement = Revolutionary Work and Capture  Strongly anti-French, Ighilahriz joined the FLN under the codename Lila in late 1956 to work as a courier, smuggling information, weapons and bombs across Algiers in bread baked by her father. On 28 September 1957 while traveling with a FLN party, Ighilahriz was ambushed by the French paratroopers at Ch√©bli, badly wounded and captured. At the hospital, Ighilahriz was given the \\"truth drug\\" Pentothal to make her talk, which failed to achieve its purpose.  Conditions in the FLN for Women  Ighilahriz wrote in her memoirs that the other members of her unit viewed her with suspicion as the only woman, explaining that, \\"for them I remained a women of the town who, horror of horrors, even knew how to use a pen.\\" Furthermore, Ighilahriz wrote that during this period, ‚ÄúI was no longer really a woman. The war had transformed me, I had become lacking in all feeling and had basically forgotten my femininity.‚Äù Military prison Ighilahriz was taken to a military prison at Paradou Hydra where a French Army captain, Jean Graziani, cut her bangs, prodded her wounds with a bayonet and then raped her in her words \\"with all sorts of objects\\" to make her talk. For months, Ighilahriz was tortured and raped into attempts to make her reveal what she knew about the FLN before finally breaking down in December 1957, telling her captors everything she knew about the FLN.Thomas, Martin Fight or Flight: Britain, France, and their Roads from Empire, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014 pages xi-xii. During this time, Ighilahriz was not allowed to bath and spent months covered in her own blood, excrement and urine as she was held in a tiny cell.Cohen, William \\"The Algerian War, the French State and Official Memory\\" pages 219-239 from R√©flexions Historiques, Vol. 28, No. 2, Summer 2002 page 233 Ighilahriz remembered: \\"Mon urine s‚Äôinfiltrait sous la b√¢che du lit de camp, mes excr√©ments se m√©langeaient √† mes menstrues jusqu‚Äô√† former une cro√ªte puante‚Äù (\\"My urine passed through the sheet covering the camp bed, my excrement mixed with my menstrual blood, forming a stinking crust\\"). To further degrade her, Ighilahriz was forced to live completely naked during her entire time at the military prison. Ighilahriz recalled: > \\"I was lying naked, always naked. They would come one, two or three times > daily. As soon as I heard the sound of their boots in the hallway, I began > to tremble. Then time became endless. The minutes seemed like hours, and the > hours like days. The hardest thing was handling the first days, to get used > to the pain. Then one would be detached mentally, as if the body began to > float. > > Massu was brutal, awful. Bigeard was not better, but the worst was Graziani. > It‚Äôs unspeakable, he was a pervert who took pleasure in torturing. It was > not human. I often yelled at him: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a man if you do not finish me! > ‚Äù And he answered with a sneer: ‚ÄúNot yet, not yet!‚Äù During these three > months, I had one goal: to kill myself, but the worst suffering, is to want > at all costs to erase oneself and to not find the means.\\" Ighilahriz stated about Captain Jean Graziani: \\"Mais l‚Äôessentiel de ses tortures ne s‚Äôexer√ßaient pas √† mains nues. Il √©tait toujours arm√© d‚Äôustensiles pour s‚Äôacharner contre mon pl√¢tre‚Äù (\\"But he did not carry out most of his torture with his bare hands. He was always armed with implements to attack my plaster cast\\").  Family  Ighilahriz's family also suffered: \\"They arrested my parents and most of my siblings. My mother has undergone waterboarding for three weeks. One day, they brought before her the youngest of her nine children, my 3 years old little brother, and they hung him.\\"  Dr. Richaud  Ighilahriz credited her survival to a doctor whom she knew only as \\"Richaud\\", who she called a most gentle and kind man who treated her injuries. At the time she first met \\"Richard\\", Ighilahriz recalled \\" ‚ÄúJ‚Äô√©tais en train de devenir folle‚Äù (\\"I was losing my mind\\"), stating the effects of torture, rape and repeated injections of the \\"truth drug\\" Pentothal had pushed her to the brink of madness. \\"Richaud\\" told Ighilahriz that she reminded him of his daughter who was about her age, and to whom he was very close.Mortimer, Mildred \\"Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Dani√®√®le Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar\\" pages 101-127 from Research in African Literatures, Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 109. \\"Richaud\\" played something of a surrogate father to Ighilahriz as she remembered him telling her: \\"Mon petit, vous √™tes bien jeune pour le maquis. Je vous en prie, laissez √ßa aux autres. Aux hommes, par exemple!\\" (\\"My child, you are too young for the resistance. I beg of you, leave that to others, to men, for example!\\") The scholar Mildred Mortimer writes that \\"Richaud\\" for all his tenderness and compassion towards Ighilahriz ascribed to the traditional French macho viewpoint that war was entirely for men, seeing her involvement with the FLN as something unnatural for a woman, and noted by contrast that Ighilahriz's father had encouraged his daughters to join the FLN. Mortimer also the irony that through \\"Richaud\\" saved Ighilahriz's life that he was a supporter of Alg√©rie fran√ßaise, approving of the goals through not the methods of the French Army in Algeria. After confessing, Ighilahriz was taken to France, where was held in prisons in Baumettes, La Roquette, Amiens, Fresnes, Toulouse and Bastia. In January 1962, Ighilariz escaped from prison, and was hidden by French Communists in Nice. Under the amnesty of May 1962, Ighilahriz was pardoned. Afterwards, Ighilahriz went to university where she obtained a degree in psychology. In Muslim Algeria, a woman must be a virgin in order to be married, and the subject of rape is strictly taboo, and upon Ighilahriz's return to Algeria, her mother made her promise never to speak of her ordeal lest it shame the family.Mortimer, Mildred \\"Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Dani√®√®le Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar\\" pages 101-127 from Research in African Literatures, Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 110. Decades after this promise, Ighilahriz broke it to publicize her experience, thereby encouraging \\"other Algerian women and men to discuss their experiences publicly as well.\\"  Publicization  Ighilahriz's story was unknown until 15 June 2000 when Le Monde newspaper published an interview conducted by the journalist Florence Beaug√© with her. University-educated, secular, fluent in French and very fond of quoting Victor Hugo, Ighilahriz came across in her interview with Beaug√© as more French than Algerian, which helped to make her a more appealing victim to the French. Shatz notes that \\"What made her interview particularly poignant was that she seemed to be moved less by rage at her jailers than by gratitude to the doctor who saved her.\\" Ighilahriz stated her reason for going forward after remaining silent for decades as she was too ashamed of what had happened to her was that she wanted to see \\"Richaud\\" one last time to thank him.  Interviews Regarding the War  In an interview with Le Monde in 2000, Ighilahriz stated that both General Marcel Bigeard and General Jacques Massu had been present when she was raped and tortured in 1957. Bigeard stated in an interview that her story was a \\"tissue of lies\\" meant to \\"destroy all that is decent in France\\" and denied Richaud even existed.Cohen, William \\"The Algerian War, the French State and Official Memory\\" pages 219-239 from R√©flexions Historiques, Vol. 28, No. 2, Summer 2002 page 234 By contrast, Massu told the French media that he was not present when Ighilahriz was tortured and raped, saying he could not remember her, but expressed \\"regret\\" that the paras had engaged in torture and used rape as an interrogation tool, saying that there were things that had happened in Algeria that he wished had never happened. Massu confirmed the existence of Richaud, saying that Ighilahriz must had been referring to Dr. Fran√ßois Richaud, who had been the doctor stationed at the prison in 1957. Dr. Richaud had died on 21 September 1997. A devout Catholic, Massu had written to Pope Pius XII in February 1957 to complain that the Catholic archbishop of Algiers was not giving his men sufficient spiritual support as they went about the business of torture, and in March 1957 his conscience was greatly eased when the Catholic chaplain attached to his unit told him that God approved of torture as the only way to defeat the FLN, who were all Muslims.Reid, Douglas \\"Re-Viewing the Battle of Algiers with Germaine Tillion\\" pages 93-115 from History Workshop Journal, Volume 60, Autumn 2005 page 107. After Ighilarhiz had accused him of torturing her in 2000, General Massu visited his parish priest for confession, and afterwards announced that he changed his mind about torture, saying he now believed that torture was not necessary to win the Battle of Algiers. In 2014, Ighilahriz described her wish that France would recognize the events of the war in Algeria. In particular, she mentioned that General Bollardi√®re, who had protested the torture of Algerians by the French, had not had his reputation restored following his arrest in April 1957 for discussing the torture with the French press. She said that his rehabilitation would essentially equate to France admitting to large-scale torture and rape during the Algerian War. Ighilahriz explained, \\"Le viol, c‚Äôest ce qu‚Äôil y a de pire pour une femme : c‚Äôest la n√©gation d‚Äôelle-m√™me\\" [rape is the worst for a woman; it is the negation of her very self].  Book Publication  After the interview, Ighilahriz dictated her life story to the French journalist Anne Nivat which was published in 2001 as Alg√©rienne, becoming a bestseller in France.Thomas, Martin Fight or Flight: Britain, France, and their Roads from Empire, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014 page xii. Nivat stated about her first impression of Ighilahriz: \\"D√®s la premi√®re seconde o√π j‚Äôai crois√© son regard, j‚Äôai cru en cette femme...Je savais qu‚Äôelle parlerait, parce qu‚Äôelle avait beaucoup √† raconter et souhaitait le raconter. Je n‚Äôai pas √©t√© d√©√ßue\\" (\\"From the moment our eyes met, I believed in this woman. . . . I knew that she would speak, because she had a lot to say and wanted to speak out. I was not disappointed\\").Mortimer, Mildred \\"Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Dani√®√®le Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar\\" pages 101-127 from Research in African Literatures, Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 108. As Algeria is a Muslim nation, the subject of rape is taboo, and Mortimer writes that it was significant that Ighilahriz's story was published in French rather than her native Berber or Arabic as the story of a Berber woman being raped is unpublishable in Algeria, even today.Mortimer, Mildred \\"Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Dani√®√®le Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar\\" pages 101-127 from Research in African Literatures, Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 107. At the beginning of Alg√©rienne, Ighilahriz stated that her decision to go forward with her story took place over the opposition of her family, her colleagues and the Algerian government, all of whom felt that the story of a Berber woman being raped was deeply shameful.Mortimer, Mildred \\"Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Dani√®√®le Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar\\" pages 101-127 from Research in African Literatures, Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 108 & 110. Mortimer explains through Ighilahriz suffered terribly, the purpose of her story is more to pay tribute to Dr. Richaud rather than to express rage at her torturers and rapists. A key moment in Alg√©rienne was when Ighilarhriz and her sister Ouardia visited the grave of Dr. Richaud to place flowers before his tombstone. On 21 September 2000, the Ighilahriz sisters and Nivat visited the tomb of Dr. Richaud, where the sisters offered him a symbolic cup of coffee in an \\"ecumenical gesture\\" of thanks.Mortimer, Mildred \\"Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Dani√®√®le Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar\\" pages 101-127 from Research in African Literatures, Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 pages 108-109. Afterwards, the Ighilahriz sisters met with Richaud's daughter to give her their thanks for her father's actions. On 31 December 2000, Ouardia Ighilahriz returned alone to Richaud's grave to place a plaque reading \\"O√π que tu sois, tu seras toujours parmi nous. Louisette\\" (\\"Wherever you are, you will always be among us. Louisette\\"). Attached to the plaque was a handwritten note with a drawing of a dove carrying an olive branch reading: \\"Avec toute ma gratitude.‚ÄîLouisette\\" (\\"With all my gratitude.‚ÄìLouisette\\").Mortimer, Mildred \\"Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Dani√®√®le Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar\\" pages 101-127 from Research in African Literatures, Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 pages 109.  Trauma and Support  Mortimer noted that the university- educated and independent-minded Ighilahriz is fluent in French, but chose not to write down her own story, instead dictating it to Nivat, and had to be accompanied by Nivat and her sister to Dr. Richaud's tomb, which for her was evidence of the extraordinary difficult nature of Ighilahriz's experiences. Mortimer further noted how much emotional support Ighilariz drew from fellow women as her sister Ouardia and Nivat played a key role in helping her confront her past, suggesting the story of Alg√©rienne is actually the story of three women rather than one. Mortimer commented that it was striking that it came to dealing with the memory of almost unspeakable physical and sexual abuse that, besides for Dr. Richuad, all of the emotional support that Ighilahriz drew upon came from other women.  Response in Algeria  Rather more unexpectedly, Saadi Yacef, a leading FLN militant who is currently a senator in Algeria, attacked Ighilahriz in 2011, claiming she was never a member of the FLN and lied about being raped, stating she is \\"excellent dans l'art de faire de la com√©die\\". In response to Schmidt, Ighilahriz stated that after the passage of almost 50 years, she may have misremembered small details and the way in which Schmidt obsessively tried to discredit her over small mistakes suggested the French Army on an institutional level was still not willing to admit that it engaged in torture and rape during the Algerian War. In response to Yacef, Ighilahriz accused him of breaking under torture when he was captured by the French and stated that as a Berber Muslim man, he was angry at her for breaking the taboo surrounding rape in Berber culture.Rahal, Malika \\"Fused Together and Torn Apart: Stories and Violence in Contemporary Algeria\\" pages 118-151 from History and Memory, Volume 24, No. 1, Spring/Summer 2012 page 146. Ighilahriz also suggested that Yacef was jealous of the way that her story had come to overshadow his in the popular memory of the Algerian War. Natalya Vince writes that, with the support of other female former FLN fighters, \\"Ighilahriz called a press conference and retorted that Saadi himself was a traitor,\\" calling for him to \\"give up his parliamentary immunity as a presidentially elected senator to come and face her, as a citizen, in court to dispute the facts.\\" The lack of subsequent court case causes Vince to describe Ighilahriz as \\"the vindicated underdog who had forced Saadi to back down despite his greater political power.\\" Finally, Ighilahriz called for unbiased, independent Algerian historians.  Response in France  The British historian Martin Thomas writes that Ighilahriz's interview and her book generated a major \\"media storm\\" in France in 2000-2001, as her account of physical and sexual abuse while in the custody for three months in late 1957 of the 10th Paratroop Division resonated with the French people, making her into the face of victims of torture in Algeria.Thomas, Martin Fight or Flight: Britain, France, and their Roads from Empire, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014 page 462. Thomas further noted that at the same time that Alg√©rienne was a bestseller, another book about the Algerian War, namely Services sp√©ciaux Alg√©rie 1955-1957 by General Paul Aussaresses, was an even bigger bestseller in France. Thomas also noted that Services sp√©ciaux Alg√©rie 1955-1957 was translated into English as The Battle of the Casbah: Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism in Algeria, 1955-1957 while Alg√©rienne still awaits its translation. He argues many people even today in the West still attach greater value to the lives of Westerners over non-Westerners, which explains why a book by a Frenchman describing and justifying torture as a legitimate counter- terrorism tactic in the Battle of Algiers attracts more attention and better sales than does a book by an Algerian woman describing her experiences of the said torture that Aussaresses ordered. General Maurice Schmitt of the French Army accused Ighilahriz of fabricating her entire story in a 2003 essay, making much of the fact that she described Captain Jean Graziani as having green eyes when in fact he had brown eyes. Schmitt stated that he served alongside Grazinai in Vietnam, and called him a passionate French patriot from Corsica, whom he described as incapable of committing the acts that Ighilahriz accused him of. The Canadian historian Barnett Singer came to Bigeard's defense, writing that Ighilahriz was a terrorist whose account was full of \\"fabrications\\" and Bigeard was off hunting the FLN in the bled at the time she was held by the 10th Parachute Division in late 1957.Singer Barnett The Americanization of France: Searching for Happiness after the Algerian War, Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield, 2013 page 231 More controversy has centered over the fact that in the first edition of Alg√©rienne, Ighilahriz denied being raped, saying ‚ÄúIl ne pouvait pas non plus me violer, j‚Äô√©tais trop d√©gueulasse!\\" (\\"He couldn‚Äôt think of raping me. I was too disgusting!\\"), but testified at the civil trial of General Schmitt that she had been raped. Schmitt who served in Algeria has been accused of having engaged in torture. However, Mortimer defends Ighilahriz on the grounds that in the Muslim Berber culture it is considered deeply shameful for an unmarried woman not to be a virgin, so to avoid public scorn she would not want to discuss being raped.  Political Views and Work Since the War = Work with the UNFA  After the war, Ighilahriz worked with the Union Nationale des Femmes Alg√©riennes (UNFA), an association meant to embody ‚Äú‚Äòthe Algerian woman‚Äô abroad,‚Äù represent ‚Äúher interest and needs at home,‚Äù and prepare ‚Äúher to participate in the running of the state,‚Äù although it essentially functioned as a ‚Äúbranch of the FLN‚Äôs mass organisation apparatus‚Äù supporting the single party state. Scholars such as Abdelkader Cheref describe the UNFA as essential to ‚Äúorganizing active women to provide backing for the state‚Äôs policies,‚Äù yet ‚Äúa token maneuver intended to satisfy Algerian women‚Äôs demands for political representation without really giving it.‚Äù Ighilahriz‚Äôs activities as a member of the executive committee of the UNFA included visits to other countries, ‚Äúostensibly with the task of looking at socio-economic models which might work in Algeria.‚Äù However, despite her participation, Ighilahriz described qualms with the UNFA, saying ‚ÄúI found myself in the Secretariat of the UNFA. Almost without thinking, and I‚Äôm angry with myself.‚Äù According to later statements, Ighilahriz opposed the very theory of the UNFA, explaining, ‚ÄúI cannot accept single-sex activism‚Ä¶It was not my orientation, and it wasn‚Äôt my ideology. This man-woman dichotomy, I accepted it and I don‚Äôt how I found myself caught up in it.‚Äù On a more practical level, Ighilahriz also cited the \\"lack of ambition, inefficiency and clientelism\\" of the Union. Natalya Vince summarizes this opposition by writing that Ighilahriz and other ‚Äúeducated female veterans‚Äù viewed a female-only union as not ‚Äúa positive step towards gender equality; rather, they saw it as a regression into female difference, and, by inference, inferiority.‚Äù Furthermore, Ighilahriz explains that, regarding her work towards female political participation, \\"My task was too much, the weight of tradition was enormous and the number of conservative men extremely high. Wherever I went, I was very well received but in practice, there were dreadful obstacles.\\"  Conseil de la Nation  Louisette Ighilahriz joined the Conseil de la Nation, the upper house of the bicameral Parliament, in February 2016, having been appointed by the President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who appoints one third of the seats. Speaking of her time in the Conseil, Ighilahriz stated that she tried to work towards addressing social problems, yet stated that she and the other members were asked to ‚Äúmarcher sans trop nous poser de question‚Äù [to walk without being asked too many questions], implying that she and the Conseil lacked legitimate power.  Resignation and protest  In October 2018, Ighilahriz announced her resignation as an act of protest against President Bouteflika running for a fifth mandate. She stated that the fourth mandate finished very poorly and claimed that due to his minimal public appearances, she would not vote for ‚Äúun candidat invisible‚Äù [an invisible candidate]. She also denounced the President‚Äôs failure to facilitate investment. In February 2019, potential presidential candidate Ali Ghediri announced on his Facebook page that Ighilahriz had declared her support for him. She subsequently told TSA, an Algerian news site, that his policy plans convinced her, noting particularly his plans to fight against corruption and unemployment, to create new jobs, and to try to stop underground emigration. She further described him as brave, humble, and wise, remarking that she believed that he would satisfy the Algerian people and cause significant changes for the good. However, as of March 7, 2019, in the context of massive protests across Algeria against President Bouteflika running for a fifth mandate, Ighilahriz announced to TSA that she no longer supports Ali Ghediri as a candidate. Instead, she remarked, ‚ÄúNous sommes en train de tout faire pour que le syst√®me s‚Äôen aille et quant le syst√®me partira, on se mettra d‚Äôaccord sur une constituante comme point de d√©part et nous formerons un nouveau gouvernement par la suite‚Äù [We are doing everything so that the system goes away, and when the system leaves, we will agree on a constituent phase as a departure point and we will form a new government thereafter].

It has smooth, powdery white bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, more or less spherical flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and cup-shaped to hemispherical fruit. It grows in the Kimberley region of Western Australia and in adjacent areas of the Northern Territory. Description Eucalyptus confluens is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, powdery, white over pale pink bark throughout. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section, and broadly egg-shaped to almost round, dull green leaves that are long and wide. The adult leaves are the same glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on a very short pedicel. Mature buds are oval to almost spherical, long and wide with a rounded to conical operculum. Flowering occurs between February and March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped to hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves level with or slightly raised above the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus confluens was first formally described in 1916 by Joseph Maiden from an incomplete description by William Vincent Fitzgerald. The specific epithet (confluens) is a Latin word meaning \\"place where two streams meet\\", referring to the arrangement of the leaf veins. Eucalyptus confluens is similar in appearance two other white gums within its area of occurrence, E. brevifolia and E. gregoriensis. Distribution and habitat Kimberley gum is found in two disjunct populations in the Kimberley region of Western Australia and adjacent areas of the Northern Territory. One population grows on the Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges and the other in the Lake Argyle area on the Western Australia-Northern Territory border. It is often found on rocky hillsides or ridges growing in sandy stony soils over sandstone, granite or quartzite.

They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish. *Black skimmer, Rynchops niger Gulls Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Laridae Laridae is a family of medium to large seabirds and includes gulls, kittiwakes, and terns. They are typically gray or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with gray or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species known to live in excess of 30 years. *Laughing gull, Leucophaeus atricilla *Franklin's gull, Leucophaeus pipixcan (V) *Ring-billed gull, Larus delawarensis (V) *Great black-backed gull, Larus marinus (V) *Lesser black-backed gull, Larus fuscus (V) *Herring gull, Larus argentatus (V) *Brown noddy, Anous stolidus *Black noddy, Anous minutus *Sooty tern, Onychoprion fuscatus *Bridled tern, Onychoprion anaethetus *Least tern, Sternula antillarum *Large-billed tern, Phaetusa simplex (V) *Gull-billed tern, Gelochelidon nilotica *Caspian tern, Hydroprogne caspia (V) *Black tern, Chlidonias niger *Common tern, Sterna hirundo *Roseate tern, Sterna dougallii *Forster's tern, Sterna forsteri (V) *Sandwich tern, Thalasseus sandvicensis *Royal tern, Thalasseus maximus Tropicbirds Order: PhaethontiformesFamily: Phaethontidae Tropicbirds are slender white birds of tropical oceans with exceptionally long central tail feathers. Their heads and long wings have black markings. *Red-billed tropicbird, Phaethon aethereus (V) Southern storm-petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The storm-petrels are relatives of the petrels and are the smallest seabirds. They feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. *Wilson's storm-petrel, Oceanites oceanicus (V) Shearwaters Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterized by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Black-capped petrel, Pterodroma hasitata (V) *Bulwer's petrel, Bulweria bulwerii (V) *Cory's shearwater, Calonectris diomedea (V) *Audubon's shearwater, Puffinus lherminieri (V) Storks Order: CiconiiformesFamily: Ciconiidae Storks are large, long-legged, long-necked, wading birds with long, stout bills. Storks are mute, but bill-clattering is an important mode of communication at the nest. Their nests can be large and may be reused for many years. Many species are migratory. *Wood stork, Mycteria americana (V) Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black-and-white, or completely black, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. *Magnificent frigatebird, Fregata magnificens *Great frigatebird, Fregata minor (V) Boobies Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium to large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. *Masked booby, Sula dactylatra *Red-footed booby, Sula sula *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster Cormorants Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Phalacrocoracidae is a family of medium to large coastal, fish-eating seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage coloration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being black-and-white, and a few being colorful. *Neotropic cormorant, Phalacrocorax brasilianus Pelicans Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. As with other members of the order Pelecaniformes, they have webbed feet with four toes. *Brown pelican, Pelecanus occidentalis Herons Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the bitterns, herons, and egrets. Herons and egrets are medium to large wading birds with long necks and legs. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more wary.

City of Thibodaux, 360 U.S. 25 (1959), was a case in which the Supreme Court created a new doctrine of abstention. Case The city of Thibodaux, citing a 1900 state law, Act 111, sought to condemn buildings, land, equipment, poles, lines, and other properties that belonged to the Louisiana Power & Light Co. and that were located in areas that had recently been annexed by the city. The company, a Florida corporation, challenged the city's authority to condemn only a part of a utility system. The case was originally brought in the Louisiana state courts, but then removed to the United States district court on the grounds of diversity of citizenship, the petitioner being a Florida corporation.. Although the 1900 law had never been judicially interpreted, it had been cited in a similar case by the state's Attorney General, who had concluded that a city of Louisiana did not possess the authority under that law that was being asserted by the city of Thibodaux. The district court, on its own motion, stayed further proceedings in order to allow the Supreme Court of Louisiana to interpret Act 111. An appeals court rejected the district court's action. On appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the district court ruling was affirmed on the grounds that eminent domain is ‚Äúintimately involved with sovereign prerogative,‚Äù that the Louisiana law cited was unclear, and that a federal ruling based upon that law could therefore not be determinative. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on April 2, 1959, and decided on June 8, 1959. Result The court, overturning the Court of Appeals decision, concluded that ‚Äúthe District Court properly exercised the power it had in this case to stay proceedings pending a prompt state court construction of a state statute of dubious meaning.‚Äù Majority opinion The majority in Thibodaux consisted of Justices Black, Clark, Frankfurter, Harlan, Whittaker, and Stewart; the majority opinion was written by Justice Frankfurter. The majority held that the district court's abstention was justified because the issue of eminent domain was ‚Äúintimately involved with the sovereign prerogative.‚Äù Given that such matters ‚Äúnormally turn on legislation with much local variation interpreted in local settings,‚Äù it was proper for federal courts to defer to state courts ‚Äúin a matter close to the political interests of a State‚Äù in the interests of ‚Äúharmonious federal-state relations.‚Äù The majority also noted that the district court had not abdicated jurisdiction but simply postponed it, allowing for the possibility of the case being returned to the district court following a declaratory judgment about the state law by a Louisiana court. The majority cited Justice Holmes's dissenting opinion in Madisonville Traction Co. v. St. Bernard Mining Co.: ‚ÄúThe fundamental fact is that eminent domain is a prerogative of the state which, on the one hand, may be exercised in any way that the state thinks fit, and, on the other, may not be exercised except by an authority which the state confers.‚Äù The majority, specifically citing Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., further noted: ‚ÄúWe have increasingly recognized the wisdom of staying actions in the federal courts pending determination by a state court of decisive issues of state law.‚Äù The majority opinion went on to say that: > The special nature of eminent domain justifies a district judge, when his > familiarity with the problems of local law so counsels him, to ascertain the > meaning of a disputed state statute from the only tribunal empowered to > speak definitively ‚Äì the courts of the State under whose statute eminent > domain is sought to be exercised ‚Äì rather than himself make a dubious and > tentative forecast. This course does not constitute abnegation of judicial > duty. On the contrary, it is a wise and productive discharge of it. There is > only postponement of decision for its best fruition. The court then applied these principles to the specific case: > In providing on his own motion for a stay in this case, an experienced > district judge was responding in a sensible way to a quandary about the > power of the City of Thibodaux into which he was placed by an opinion of the > Attorney General of Louisiana in which it was concluded that, in a > strikingly similar case, a Louisiana city did not have the power here > claimed by the City. A Louisiana statute apparently seems to grant such a > power. But that statute has never been interpreted, in respect to a > situation like that before the judge, by the Louisiana courts, and it would > not be the first time that the authoritative tribunal has found in a statute > less than meets the outsider's eye. Informed local courts may find meaning > not discernible to the outsider. The consequence of allowing this to come to > pass would be that this case would be the only case in which the Louisiana > statute is construed as we would construe it, whereas the rights of all > other litigants would be thereafter governed by a decision of the Supreme > Court of Louisiana quite different from ours. Caught between the language of > an old but uninterpreted statute and the pronouncement of the Attorney > General of Louisiana, the district judge determined to solve his > conscientious perplexity by directing utilization of the legal resources of > Louisiana for a prompt ascertainment of meaning through the only tribunal > whose interpretation could be controlling ‚Äì the Supreme Court of Louisiana. > The District Court was thus exercising a fair and well considered judicial > discretion in staying proceedings pending the institution of a declaratory > judgment action and subsequent decision by the Supreme Court of Louisiana. Finally, the majority claimed that the present case was ‚Äútotally unlike‚Äù another case that had been decided that same day, County of Allegheny v. Mashuda Co., ‚Äúexcept for the coincidence that both cases involve eminent domain proceedings.‚Äù In Mashuda, the Court held that a district court had been in error when it dismissed a complaint, and that, since the state law in question was clear and ‚Äúonly factual issues need be resolved,‚Äù there was no just reason ‚Äúto refrain from prompt adjudication.‚Äù Dissent Justices Warren, Douglas, and Brennan dissented; Justice Brennan wrote the dissent. The dissent argued that when a district court is presented with a case between citizens of different states, it is disrespectful to the concept of diversity jurisdiction to send the case to a state court. A judge can abdicate his duty, wrote Justice Brennan, ‚Äúonly in the exceptional circumstances where the order to the parties to repair to the state court would clearly serve one of two important countervailing interests: either the avoidance of a premature and perhaps unnecessary decision of a serious federal constitutional question or the avoidance of the hazard of unsettling some delicate balance in the area of federal-state relationships.‚Äù Justice Brennan, too, cited Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., in which ‚Äúthis Court held that the District Court should have stayed its hand while state issues were resolved in a state court when an injunction was sought to restrain the enforcement of the order of a state administrative body on the ground that the order was not authorized by the state law and was violative of the Federal Constitution.‚Äù Justice Brennan pointed out that the Supreme Court had ‚Äúupheld an abstention when the exercise by the federal court of jurisdiction would disrupt a state administrative process‚Äù (Burford v. Sun Oil Co.) or ‚Äúinterfere with the collection of state taxes‚Äù (Toomer v. Witsell), or ‚Äúotherwise create needless friction by unnecessarily enjoining state officials from executing domestic policies‚Äù (Alabama Public Service Commission v. Southern R. Co.). But no such circumstances, he stated, were present in the Louisiana case: > There is no more possibility of conflict with the State in this situation > than there is in the ordinary negligence or contract case in which a > District Court applies state law under its diversity jurisdiction. A > decision by the District Court in this case would not interfere with > Louisiana administrative processes, prohibit the collection of state taxes, > or otherwise frustrate the execution of state domestic policies. Quite the > reverse, this action is part of the process which the City must follow in > order to carry out the State's policy of expropriating private property for > public uses. Finally, in this case, the State of Louisiana, represented by > its constituent organ the City of Thibodaux, urges the District Court to > adjudicate the state law issue. How, conceivably, can the Court justify the > abdication of responsibility to exercise jurisdiction on the ground of > avoiding interference and conflict with the State when the State itself > desires the federal court's adjudication? It is obvious that the abstention > in this case was for the convenience of the District Court, not for the > State. Thibodaux abstention The issues addressed in Thibodaux had previously been the subject of an earlier Supreme Court case, Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co. (1941), which established a principle called the \\"Pullman abstention\\". Although the decisions in the two cases were similar, what set Thibodaux apart was that it did not involve a constitutional issue that could be avoided or modified by a state court interpretation of some underlying issue of state law. In Thibodaux, a ruling at the federal level would have amounted to an interpretation of a vague Louisiana law and, thus, a determination of the circumstances under which the city could or could not exercise the power it claimed to have under the 1900 Louisiana law. The decision in Thibodaux gave rise to a new principle, the \\"Thibodaux abstention\\", which is defined as \\"[a] federal court‚Äôs act of declining to exercise its jurisdiction to allow a state court to decide difficult issues if importance in order to avoid unnecessary friction between federal and state authorities\\". A key difference between the Pullman and Thibodaux doctrines is that under Pullman the court retains jurisdiction over federal issues and does not dismiss the case, while under the Thibodaux doctrine the case will, in fact, be dismissed in some instances. There are several other federal abstention doctrines that derive from various Supreme Court cases, including the so-called Younger and Colorado River abstentions. The Burford abstention, derived from Burford v. Sun Oil Co. (1943), in which a federal court sent a dispute over oil-drilling rights to a Texas court that was far more familiar with the issues involved, is similar to the Thibodaux abstention, and some abstentions are in fact identified as Burford-Thibodaux or Thibodaux-Burford abstentions. Allegheny County v. Frank Mashuda Co. A number of observers have commented on the difference between the rulings in Thibodaux and Allegheny County v. Frank Mashuda Co., which involved the question of whether a plaintiff's property could be confiscated under eminent domain in order to enlarge a private airport. In Allegheny County, the Court did not allow for abstention. ‚ÄúThe apparent inconsistency between the two decisions has been the subject of considerable law review commentary,‚Äù notes one observer.

It was founded in the ancient city of Philippi, where it was based until the destruction of the host city in the 14th or 15th century. Today it is based in the city of Kavala. Although being subject to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, it is administered by the Church of Greece. History Philippi was an early site of Christianity, with a bishopric established at an unknown later time. The church was mentioned several times in the New Testament and in the Byzantine Notitiae Episcopatuum.Joseph Bingham, Origines Ecclesiasticae; Or the Antiquities of the Christian Church and Other Works: In Nine Volumes, p 190, Volume 3 (Straker, 1843) RFodRG5aeIluuxRfFB6f8xU&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwigtcOvk_bMAhUlIaYKHSU8DHgQ6AEIOTAG#v=onepage&q;=Philippi&f;=false (online version) Several basilicas were built here under the Byzantines.Eduard Verhoef, Philippi: How Christianity Began in Europe: The Epistle to the Philippians, p 82 (online version) Bishops The identity of the first bishop of Philippi is a matter of controversy. The church in Philippi was established through the work of Saint Paul, who later in the Epistle to the Philippians refers to unnamed bishops (episkopoi) and deacons of the church there.Philippians 1:1 The fact that his reference is to bishops (in the plural) and that they are unnamed has led to some conjecture over their identity.

Berndt wrote an eyewitness account of the 1940 German invasion of the Low Countries and France, Tanks Break Through!, and is regarded as propagandistic creator of the \\"Desert Fox\\" myth attached to the German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. Youth and first political activities Alfred-Ingemar Berndt was the son of Gustav Berndt and Alma Berndt n√©e Kaeding. The Berndts were expelled and dispossessed from Posen in 1920, a result of the Versailles Treaty. The family moved to Berlin-Sch√∂neberg, where Berndt in 1922, age 17, joined the National Socialist German Workers Party. In 1924 he joined the Frontbann, reorganized front organization of the Sturmabteilung or SA. After the prohibition of the Nazi Party expired in 1925, he re-joined definitively. He was instrumental in building the organization and structure of the Hitler Youth in Berlin. In December 1928, after interrupted study of German literature and volunteer work for German newspapers, Berndt got a job at Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau (WTB), the largest news agency in Germany. Berndt was able to disguise his Nazi leanings as serious journalism. He wrote under various pseudonyms as columnist and commentator, and became a writer for two Nazi papers, Der Angriff and Der V√∂lkische Beobachter. In 1931 he became head of the writers‚Äô division of the Kampfbund f√ºr deutsche Kultur, an organization of Nazi authors, high school teachers, journalists, and cultural personages. A central figure in a growing network of Nazi newsmen at home and abroad, he was jailed and imprisoned from time to time during the Weimar Republic on account of his politics.Willi A. Boelcke: Kriegspropaganda 1939‚Äì1941. Geheime Ministerkonferenzen im Reichspropagandaministerium. DVA, Stuttgart 1966, S. 77. Hitler‚Äôs rise to power as a career booster When Hitler became Chancellor in January 1933, Berndt's position in the Kampfbund f√ºr deutsche Kultur led to his promotion in Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau, which had become the Nazi press office, the Deutsche Nachrichtenb√ºro (DNB). In December 1933 he became chief editor of the DNB. Berndt was responsible for the coordination of the Reichsverbandes der Deutschen Presse (RDP) and was deputy of the Reich Press Chief, Otto Dietrich. After the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, when Hitler's men murdered many opponents, Berndt left the SA and joined the Schutzstaffel (SS). In the Propaganda Ministry=Rise Joseph Goebbels, with his doctorate in German literature from the University of Heidelberg, recognized a good writer when he read one. In 1935 Goebbels hired Berndt as official head of the Reich Press Office in the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. In April 1936, Berndt was appointed head of the press department of the Propaganda Ministry (Division IV). In a November 1936 interview, Berndt told The New York Times that German 'Art Reporters' were permitted to 'Employ Values Established' by the Party and State.Germany Explains Curb on Criticism. New York Times. November 29, 1936 p 31. In February 1938, reacting to Hitler's taking complete control of the Wehrmacht, Berndt told the press that no street fighting or troop mutiny had occurred; the frontiers had not been closed, and no army officers had been executed.Sigrid Schultz. Berlin charges Jews started anti-Nazi yarns. Chicago Tribune. 12 Feb 1938 p 7 After the partitioning of the press department in March 1938, Berndt was made head of the newly created home department (Division IV-A). Berndt devised the propaganda used during the annexation of Austria and the Sudetenland. He announced to foreign reporters that it was an insult to the German government for a citizen to doubt what he reads in the newspapers.A great American institution. Lancaster Eagle Gazette (Lancaster, Ohio) 12 March 1938 Pleased with his prot√©g√©, Goebbels promoted Berndt, October 1938, to Ministerial Director. At the instigation of Otto Dietrich, Berndt was replaced as head of the press department by Hans Fritzsche, December 1938. Berndt then took on, at Goebbels' personal request, the department of literature (Division VIII), which had, among other tasks, responsibility for literary censorship and ideological control of writers and authors. During World War II On 30 August 1939, two days before the start of the Second World War, Berndt was appointed Head of Broadcasting of the Propaganda Ministry (Division III). In early November 1939 Goebbels learned of Berndt's conflicts with the Reich Post Office, and rejected him as a negotiator for the Propaganda Ministry. In February 1940, Berndt reported that he had fulfilled his task of adapting the German broadcasting system to the requirements of war and war propaganda. He was released from all functions in the Propaganda Ministry and enlisted as a volunteer in the Wehrmacht. In the French campaign he was a sergeant in Heavy Tank Destroyer Battalion 605. He was awarded the Iron Cross second class, 27 May 1940. On 6 June 1940 he received the Iron Cross First Class. He wrote about his experiences at the front (Tanks Break Through!, 1940).Tanks Break Through in the Library of Congress catalog In August 1940 Berndt returned to the Propaganda Ministry, but left administrative work mainly to his previous deputies. Berndt was first head of the Propaganda Ministry Offices in Paris.Lehrer, Steven. Wartime Sites in Paris. SF Tafel 2013 p 143 In May 1941 he went back to the front; this time as a lieutenant on the staff of the German Afrika Korps under then Lieutenant General Erwin Rommel. Rommel had been enormously displeased with Oberleutnant Alfred Tschimpke, a propaganda reporter who had written a book about the 7th Panzer Division that Rommel commanded in France.Desmond Young. Rommel the Desert Fox. Quill / William Morrrow; Reprint edition (February 18, 1987)Alfred Tschimpke. Die Gespenster-Division (Die Wehrmacht im Zweiten Weltkrieg 2) Eher Verlag 1940 Author David Irving described Berndt as \\"Burly, wavy-haired and dark-skinned\\". He \\"had the lumbering gait of a bear and a physiological oddity--six toes on one foot. (Goebbels had a right club foot.) Berndt was literate and personable, poked his nose in everywhere, and was put in charge of keeping the Rommel diary. Before joining Rommel's staff as a kind of Party 'commissar,' he was already a tough, ambitious Nazi zealot.\\"Irving, David. The Trail of the Fox. Harper Collins, New York 1990 p 101 =Head of the Propaganda Department Division II and Rommel‚Äôs adjutant= After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Goebbels ordered Berndt back to Berlin and promoted him to Ministerial Director and head of propaganda (Division II). Despite his heavy involvement in the Ministry, Berndt shuttled regularly between Berlin and Rommel's headquarters until Rommel left North Africa. Berndt quickly became Rommel's trusted aide, a propaganda press manager for his boss. Berndt worked hard to promote the myth of Rommel the \\"Desert Fox,\\" as a role model par excellence for many Germans. In addition, Berndt took on the role of Rommel's personal representative in Hitler's headquarters. On 17 July 1943, Hitler personally honored Berndt for his contributions to the North African campaign with the German Cross in Gold. During his time as head of the Propaganda Department, Berndt dealt with the battle of Stalingrad, the capitulation of Tunis and the discovery of the mass graves of the Katyn massacre. He was also chairman of the Interdepartmental Air War Damages Committee, which was responsible for the coordination of relief and reconstruction after air raids. Allied pilot murder First lieutenant James Gordon Dennis On 24 May 1944, just before the Western Allies landed in Normandy, a USAAF B-17 #42-31941 \\"Big Stoop\\" from the 350th Bombardment Squadron was shot down by Luftwaffe fighters west of B√ºckwitz Lake. Eight crew members were taken prisoner, among them the co-pilot Second lieutenant James Gordon Dennis. Berndt halted his car on Hamburger Chaussee in Segeletz where Dennis was being held, and shot him dead in the street. Dennis was initially buried at Friedhof Segeletz on 26 May 1944. His remains were later interred at the Ardennes American Cemetery and Memorial.US Flight Lieutenant James Gordon Dennis on findagrave.comJoseph Goebbels: Ein Wort zum Luftkrieg. according to Peter Longerich: Goebbels - Biographie.

Break with Goebbels After the successful landing of the Western Allies, a rift developed between Goebbels and Berndt. Berndt commented, after a visit to Rommel's headquarters on the western front, that he was extremely pessimistic about the military situation. Goebbels accused Berndt of defeatism, pulled him from the propaganda department and suspended him indefinitely from the Ministry. Combat on the Eastern Front Berndt responded by volunteering for combat. In September 1944, through the mediation of Heinrich Himmler, Berndt was elevated to the military rank of SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer, the equivalent of captain, in the Waffen-SS. Death According to several eyewitnesses, Berndt, as commander of the second battalion of SS Panzer Regiment 5 \\"Viking,\\" was killed at Veszpr√©m, Hungary, during an attack by Soviet dive bombers on 28 March 1945.

Thunder was launched on 19 March 1941 and commissioned at Toronto on 14 October 1941.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 175 Thunder sailed for Halifax, Nova Scotia, arriving on 30 October and joined Sydney Force, the local escort and patrol force operating out of Sydney, Nova Scotia. In January 1942, the minesweeper transferred to the Western Local Escort Force as a convoy escort. The ship then bounced around among local forces, joining the Halifax Local Defence Force and then the Shelburne Force operating out of Shelburne, Nova Scotia, then back to Halifax Local Defence Force and finally Sydney Force. The minesweeper sailed to Europe via the Azores in February 1944 as part of the Canadian contribution to the invasion of Normandy. After arriving on 13 March, the minesweeper was assigned to the 32nd Minesweeping Flotilla as the Senior Officer's Ship. Thunder transferred to the British 4th Minesweeping Flotilla in May.Douglas et al., A Blue Water Navy, p. 233 During D-day operations, the 4th Minesweeping Flotilla was assigned to sweep assault channel 4 in the American sector.Douglas et al., A Blue Water Navy, p. 247Schull, p. 267 Once that was completed the 4th Minesweeping Flotilla was ordered to sweep between the channels 3 and 4.Schull, p. 272 Thunder and the 4th Minesweeping Flotilla continued their minesweeping duties off Normandy until 6 June, when they sailed back to Portland to sweep a new minefield that had been laid in the approaches to the harbour.Schull, p. 284 This took the flotilla ten days to complete, after which Thunder was ordered to join American minesweepers for the assault on Cherbourg.Schull, pp. 322‚Äì23 On 24 June, during the preliminary bombardment, the minesweeping force of which Thunder was a member, arrived off Point Barfleur in mid-afternoon. German shore-based gunfire began to splash down around the minesweepers after an hour, leading the escorting United States Navy destroyers to deploy a smokescreen and order the minesweepers to cut sweeps and retire. The following day during the assault, the minesweepers were deployed again. Shore-based gunfire began raining down on the minesweepers again. Thunder was hit by shrapnel from a near miss and the destroyers were once again forced to lay a smokescreen.Schull, pp. 323‚Äì24Douglas et al., A Blue Water Navy, p. 291 Thunder returned to Canada in August 1944 to undergo a refit at Sydney. The minesweeper returned to European waters in November and was assigned to the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla. In April 1945, the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla was assigned to the last large- scale combined operation in the European theatre. Sailing to the Gironde estuary on 12 April, the minesweeping flotilla swept an invasion channel for the attack force landing in the area. Once their minesweeping duties were completed, the minesweepers performed an anti-submarine patrol in the area. They continued in these duties until 16 April when the minesweepers returned to Plymouth. While transiting the Bay of Biscay, Thunder accepted the surrender of the German auxiliary minesweeper FGi 07 and with a prize crew aboard, took the vessel back to the United Kingdom.Schull, pp. 395‚Äì96 Thunder and the 31st Minesweeping Flotilla spent the next five months sweeping the English Channel.Douglas et al., A Blue Water Navy, p. 337 Thunder remained in European waters until September, when the minesweeper returned to Canada. Thunder was paid off on 4 October 1945 and laid up. The ship was sold to Marine Industries in 1947 and broken up at Sorel, Quebec.Colledge, p. 627 References=NotesCitationsSources   External links * * Category:Bangor-class minesweepers of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:Ships built in Ontario Category:Ships of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:1941 ships Category:World War II minesweepers of Canada ","title":"HMCS Thunder (J156)"},{"id":"52135693","text":"Sharyn Renshaw is an Australian international Lawn Bowls player.

Synopsis=Act I On a gray street at the end of town, there is a house where the Once-ler lives. Nearby there‚Äôs a broken statue of the Lorax with the word ‚Äòunless‚Äô engraved into it (\\"Life is Tough\\"). A kid wants to find out more about the Lorax. After being paid, the Once-ler who is now very old tells her a story, starting with his own childhood‚Ä¶ His family used to run a mill, but the Once-ler used to daydream about things he could invent instead. His family are poor and have to rent out the Once-ler‚Äôs room to a lodger, so he decides to go and find his fortune elsewhere. While travelling, the Once-ler dreams that he‚Äôll become rich as long as he has just one good idea (\\"I Could Be a Great Man\\"). He arrives in Paradise Valley and is delighted by all the new things he sees there. He sets to work, but when he cuts down a truffula tree the Lorax appears. The Lorax speaks for the trees and is angry one has been cut down. The Once-ler explains it was to make a \\"thneed\\", which the Lorax thinks is useless (\\"It's a Thneed\\"). He shows the Once-ler the beauty of the valley, and how he doesn‚Äôt need to create anything new, everything he needs to live is in abundance in the valley (\\"Everything You Need‚Äôs Right Here\\"). The Lorax leaves on his summer break after planting a new truffula tree seed. The Once-ler begins to see how silly his thneed idea is, until a businessman buys one. He throws himself into creating a new thneed business, and invites his family to join him and set up a thneed knitting factory. They are all very excited about becoming rich (\\"When We Get Rich\\"). The Lorax returns to find half the forest has been chopped down and confronts the Once-ler, arguing that the wildlife needs the trees to live as well. They agree that only trees in the area called \\"Once-ler Nook\\" will be cut down. Soon after, the factory runs out of trees. At first, the Once-ler says they must stop making thneeds, but his family and the people of the town pressure him into starting work again and cut down other trees in the valley (\\"Great Man\\"). They say he also made a promise to them that they‚Äôd be rich, and persuade the Once-ler that if he continues he‚Äôll become a powerful man. As a compromise, the Once-ler creates a nature reserve. The Lorax hates the idea and is upset about the pollution which is killing the animals, he just wants the forest to return to how it was before. Instead of stopping, the Once-ler creates a super axe hacker which cuts down trees even faster (\\"Super Axe Hacker\\"). Act II Two factory workers are opening the factory, meanwhile the Lorax sneaks inside with the animals of the forest. They start a protest to save the trees, and a TV news crew turns up to report it. The Once-ler tries to impress Samelore the reporter with his machinery, but the Lorax exposes all the pollution the factory is creating and how it‚Äôs affecting the wildlife (\\"We Are One\\"). The Once-ler starts to apologize to the viewers at home. Just as he agrees to shut the factory, he announces the new version of the thneed which makes it even more popular (\\"Thneed 2.0\\"). The Lorax sits alone on a stump and watches all the animals leave the area. The Once-ler treks up to visit him, to ask if they can still be friends. The Lorax says he‚Äôs leaving because the forest has gone. He leaves the Once-ler with one word that he doesn‚Äôt understand ‚Äì \\"unless\\". At that moment, the last truffula tree is cut down. The Once-ler‚Äôs family pack up their things and leave along with the rest of the town (\\"When We Get Rich\\" (reprise)). The Once-ler is left on his own, the story ends. The kid who has been listening to the story says that it can‚Äôt be the end ‚Äì she wants to know what \\"unless\\" means. The old Once-ler has been thinking about it for years, but doesn‚Äôt understand and can‚Äôt think of a way to bring the Lorax back when there‚Äôs no forest. The kid has an idea, they need to plant a new truffula tree. The Once-ler says it won‚Äôt work without a Lorax, but the kid persuades him to let her try. She plants the seed, waters it and waits, and finally it begins to grow (\\"Take It Wherever You Go\\"). The Once-ler is thrilled, and the kid asks if the Lorax will come back now. They finally realise that a Lorax is just someone, anyone, who looks after trees. His last word meant that nothing will get better unless someone like the kid cares enough to protect them and keep planting (\\"Take It Wherever You Go\\" (reprise)).

The book was initially published in 2010 by Icon Books in the UK with the subtitle Ten Ways That Economics Gets it Wrong, and by John Wiley & Sons in North America. Icon published a revised version in 2012, with the subtitle How the Science of Complex Systems Is Transforming Economic Thought. Translated versions were also published in Brazil, China, Japan and Korea. In 2017, Icon published a revised and expanded version with the subtitle 11 Ways Economics Gets it Wrong. Summary The book has ten chapters, each of which concentrates on a separate ‚Äúeconomyth‚Äù. These are summarized on p. 6 as follows: > 1\\\\. The economy can be described by economic laws. 2\\\\. The economy is made > up of independent individuals 3\\\\. The economy is stable 4\\\\. Economic risk > can be easily managed using statistics 5\\\\. The economy is rational and > efficient 6\\\\. The economy is gender-neutral 7\\\\. The economy is fair 8\\\\. > Economic growth can continue forever 9\\\\. Economic growth will make us happy > 10\\\\. Economic growth is always good In each case, Orrell explains the role that the myth plays in economics, discusses the problems it creates, and proposes solutions and alternatives based on ideas from areas such as complexity, network theory, nonlinear dynamics, heterodox economics, and so on. The 2017 extended version included a new chapter on the idea that > 11\\\\. The economy boils down to barter This chapter included a summary of Orrell's quantum theory of money and value. In addition, there was a foreword by Cahal Moran (co-author of The Econocracy), and an appendix The Five Stages of Economic Grief on how the economics profession is coming to terms with its role in the great financial crisis, which was excerpted in Evonomics. Reviews In a Bloomberg piece on business books, economist William White said that the book ‚ÄúLists 10 crucial assumptions (the economy is simple, fair, stable, etc.) and argues both entertainingly and convincingly that each one is totally at odds with reality. Orrell also suggests that adopting the science of complex systems would radically improve economic policymaking.‚Äù The economist Robert Nelson wrote in the International Journal of Social Economics that the book suffered from a number of omissions, in particular a fuller exploration of ‚Äúthe religious roles played by neo-classical economics.‚Äù However he concludes that ‚ÄúWhatever its omissions and other failings, much of the book is devoted to making a strong case for one very important finding ‚Äì the intellectual poverty of neo- classical economics... A wide audience including many non-economists could benefit from reading it.‚Äù In National Review, economist Michael Yates also noted some omissions, such as a discussion of worker organisation, but wrote that the book ‚Äúmakes sound recommendations that economists utilize methods of analysis and techniques that have proven their worth in other fields of study... Economists ignore such research at their peril.‚Äù The economist and business journalist Norbert H√§ring wrote in Handelsblatt that Orrell‚Äôs background as a mathematician allowed him ‚Äúto question credibly and convincingly the claim of economics for quasi-scientific objectivity and mathematical precision.‚Äù Writing at the economics blog Worthwhile Canadian Initiative, economist Frances Woolley described the writing as ‚Äújust random... it never really gets further than just a semi-articulated idea,‚Äù and economist Kevin Milligan wrote that the ‚Äúlevel of criticism in this book is juvenile.‚Äù The economist Chris Auld described the book in a blog review as \\"a terrible, willfully ignorant, deeply anti-intellectual book\\" and said that Orrell's \\"characterization of economic thought presented is ridiculous... there is nothing an interested layman could possibly learn from this book.\\" He noted a number of times in which he claimed Orrell misrepresents economics as a discipline and the views of economists. Writing at the Popular Science book site, the science writer Brian Clegg wrote that ‚ÄúThere are other books taking on economics, but I've not come across another that explains it so well for the layperson, takes in the credit crunch, totally destroys the validity of economics as we know it and should be required reading for every politician and banker. No, make that every voter in the land.‚Äù References Category:2010 non-fiction books Category:Economics books Category:Wiley (publisher) books ","title":"Economyths"},{"id":"52135773","text":"The Western Amazon Ecological Corridor () is a proposed ecological corridor connecting conservation units and indigenous territories in the southwest of the Amazon rainforest of Brazil. Background The first version of the Ecological Corridors of Tropical Forests of Brazil proposal was developed by a group of consultants at the request of the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment and presented in the first half of 1997. Seven major corridors were proposed: the Central Amazon Ecological Corridor, Northern Amazon Ecological Corridor, South Amazon Ecological Corridor, South Amazon Ecotones Ecological Corridor, Western Amazon Ecological Corridor, Central Atlantic Forest Ecological Corridor and Serra do Mar Ecological Corridor. These corresponded to about 25% of the rainforests of Brazil. Priority was given to the Central Amazon Corridor and the Central Atlantic Forest Corridor, which would test and develop the concepts for use with the subsequent corridors. Proposed scope The Western Amazon Ecological Corridor was one of five Amazon region corridors identified. It included six priority areas in four main Amazon ecoregions, and was identified as relatively stable, globally relevant and of the highest priority on a regional scale.. The corridor would have an area of . The proposed corridor comprised almost all of the state of Acre, covering about . It also covered more than half of the state of Rond√¥nia, and a small part of the state of Amazonas.

The band started in Los Angeles, where they made their first public appearances under the name Kenny and The Electrics, playing in venues like Whiskey A Go Go. They moved back to Mexico in 1980 and went on to be considered an internationally important Mexican rock band, emblematic of Mexican rock in the 1980s. Aviles has been called the Mexican Pat Benatar and one of the most- important women in Mexican rock. The real queen of rock in Mexico, Throughout its history, the lineup of the band continuously changed. In 1990, the band broke-up completely, leaving Aviles as a solo act. A new band called Kenny y los Nuevos El√©ctricos formed in 1995. The band took back its original name in 2000.  Biography =1980s The band formed in Los Angeles in 1980, appearing as Kenny and the Electrics in area venues. That year they moved to Mexico, where band members were born, to seek their roots and to be able to express themselves in Spanish. Rock music at this time was met with disapproval and performances were often relegated to what were known as hoyos funquis (funky holes). Kenny y los El√©ctricos became known on this scene. Kenny y los El√©ctricos recorded their first album, Electrimanias, in 1981 on independent label New Age Records. Around this time new venues began to appear in Mexico. The band performed at Satellite Rock along with Ritmo Peligroso, Chac-Mool, Botellita de Jerez and Taxi and at Rockotitl√°n along with bands like Caifanes, Santa Sabina, Rostros Ocultos and Fobia. In 1983, the band recorded an album with Chela Braniff, Juan Navarro and Ricardo Ochoa on the independent Comrock label. Ochoa, a former member of Peace and Love, then Kenny's guitarist, produced the album. The music of the bands in the Comrock compilations \\"became the fodder for the childhood of groups like Caf√© Tacuba, whose members were beginning to imagine a pop cultural future as hip as the north but tinged with Mexican flavor.\\" The band modified their name to Kenny y los el√©ctricos in 1986, and produced the album Juntos por el Rock 1995 with singles Me Quieres Cotorrear and A Woman in Love. By 1988, big labels were eyeing the success of rock en espa√±ol (rock music featuring Spanish lyrics) and began seeking out artists representing Mexican rock. The band recorded No huyas de mi for Discos Melody (engineered by Juan Switalski and produced by Ochoa, with lyrics by Ochoa, Kenny and Aleks Syntek), featuring musicians , Sabo Romo, Aleks Syntek, and Federico Fong. This record became a classic of Mexican rock and one of the most-played selections in bars, clubs and disco parties. 1990s Discos Denver put out a record of previously-released material, Toda la noche sin parar, in 1992. The following year, Kenny recorded the album Si no est√°s aqu√≠ with the singles Si no estas aqu√≠ and Satisf√°ceme si puedes. The band formed the lineup of Kenny y Los Nuevos El√©ctricos in 1995 after meeting Edgar Carrum. In 1999, the band recorded an electrical acoustic concert, Sensaciones Electroac√∫sticas, defining a new sound for the band in the coming decade. 2000s The band released the album Alma Beta with the single Dicen por ahi, which quickly charted and was named the best rock ballad of 2000 and one of the band's most-representative songs.

In 2016, she campaigned and was elected as a Civil Court judge for the Kings County 5th judicial district in New York State, thereby becoming the first Hasidic Jewish woman to be elected as a civil court judge in New York State, and the first Hasidic woman to hold public office in United States history. Although she ran for the Civil Court, after her election, she was assigned to serve on the Criminal Court in the Kings County 5th judicial district. She previously worked as a real estate attorney and community activist, and served as a volunteer court lawyer in the New York City Family Court. Early life and education Freier was born in Borough Park, Brooklyn, the eldest of five children in a Hasidic Jewish family. While attending the Bais Yaakov high school in Borough Park, she took a course in legal stenography, and she graduated from high school in 1982. At age 19 she married David Freier, with whom she has three sons and three daughters. Freier worked first as a legal secretary, and, in 1994, as a paralegal at law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, in order to support her husband in kollel. Her husband went on to complete an accounting degree at Touro College, and in 1996, she also decided to pursue a college education. She began studying law at age 30 after realizing she was working for lawyers younger than her. She enrolled at Lander College, part of the Touro College and University System, where she became director of the women's pre-law society, and graduated six years later with a bachelor of science degree in political science. She then entered Brooklyn Law School, completing her degree in four years, graduating in June 2005. She passed the New York State Bar in 2006. Career Rachel Freier meeting with President Bill Clinton & Hillary Clinton Freier passed the New York State Bar exam in 2006. She is also licensed to practice law in New Jersey and the District of Columbia. Freier and her husband shared an office in Borough Park, where she practiced commercial and residential estate law, and he did commercial financing. Freier also had a law office in Monroe, New York, where she does business with Hasidic residents of nearby Kiryas Joel. She advocated for the Satmar Hasidic Community by speaking to residents of Orange, Sullivan, and Rockland counties, to help correct misconceptions people might have about Hasidic life in Kiryas Joel and to better understand the Hasidic neighbors in their midst. Freier began her political career in 2001 as an intern in the Manhattan office of then-U.S. Senator from New York Hillary Clinton. She also interned for other elected officials. Civil court judge Borough President Eric Adams giving Rachel Freier an Award at her Inauguration in Brooklyn Borough Hall In April 2016, Freier announced her candidacy for Civil Court Judge, running for the spot on the bench vacated by Judge Noach Dear. In the September 2016 Democratic primary election for Civil Court Judge of the Kings County 5th judicial district, Freier garnered 4,730 votes (40.9 percent), followed by Jill Epstein with 3,993 votes (34.5 percent), and Morton Avigdor with 2,835 votes (24.5 percent). She entered the November general election, with Avigdor as a Conservative Party challenger, and received 68,088 votes (74.4 percent), to his 23,393 votes (25.6 percent). Freier was endorsed in the three-way race during the elections by The Jewish Press and the New York Daily News. On December 22, 2016, she was sworn in at Brooklyn Borough Hall. She delivered a speech that included Hebrew and Yiddish phrases and concepts which she translated into English. Her inauguration ceremony was carried live on WABC-TV and News 12. On hand for her swearing-in was Hasidic singer Lipa Schmeltzer, who sang \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" with bits of Yiddish and \\"God Bless America\\" in full Yiddish version. Subsequent to her swearing-in, Freier was assigned to serve on the New York City Criminal Court. In December 2017 Megyn Kelly welcomed Freier to The Today Show as the woman The New York Times has called ‚Äúthe Hasidic superwoman of night court‚Äù; she was featured in the series ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Got Faith,‚Äù marking her one-year anniversary on the bench. { class=\\"wikitable collapsible\\" - valign=bottom ! colspan=5  Election history - valign=bottom !

In 2008, Freier was one of the founders of B'Derech, a GED program for Haredi youth at-risk. The organization also helps troubled teens with therapy and hypnosis. The program launched in partnership with the New York branch of Bramson ORT College, adding a Men's Division and Women's Division. In 2010, Freier advocated to save Breslov Yeshiva in Williamsburg, in spite of opposition from some who harassed the students and maligned the Rabbi, Yoeli Roth. Freier received threats for defending the yeshiva, but she won the court case. In 2011, she founded Ezras Nashim, an all-female Orthodox Jewish volunteer EMT ambulance service established with the goal of preserving women's modesty in emergency medical situations, especially childbirth. The group was formed after its request to add a female corps of EMT volunteers to the all-male Hatzalah organization, the long-standing Orthodox Jewish EMT service in New York City, was rejected. Hatzalah was the subject of controversy as articles in the New York Post and JEMS Magazine criticize the organization for its discriminatory practice of not allowing women to join. The group of Orthodox women cited the need for modesty and sensitivity to the needs of fellow Orthodox women. Freier is working on a project to buy an ambulance for the organization. Freier initially provided advocacy services for the group, and took over the directorship of the organization in 2012. Ezras Nashim was licensed by the New York State Department of Health in February 2013, though the volunteer corps respond in their own private vehicles as Ezras Nashim is still awaiting a license to operate a full ambulance service. In October 2019, a public hearing was held over Ezras Nashim's ambulance license at The Regional Emergency Medical Services Council of NYC. In November 2019, The Council did not approve the motion, a failure of either side to produce a majority of 14 votes to either pass the motion or deny it. Therefore, the case will move up to the Albany State EMS Council for a Decision. Affiliations Freier is a licensed EMT, and has completed advanced training to qualify as a New York State paramedic. She has served on Borough Park's Community Board 12, and performed pro bono legal services for the New York City Family Court. Freier appeared in a documentary about Ezras Nashim, entitled \\"93QUEEN\\", which was directed by filmmaker Paula Eiselt. The film made its world premiere on May 1, 2018, at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival. The film aired on PBS's POV, marking its television debut, on September 17, 2018. Honors and awards Freier honored at the New York City Council Chambers with a Proclamation Award for being elected as the first Hasidic woman to public office in New York City, September 7, 2017 In September 2017, Freier was honored at the New York City Hall in the Council Chambers with a \\"Proclamation Award\\" presented by the Speaker & Council-members of the Jewish Caucus for her achievement of becoming the First Hasidic Woman elected to Public Office in New York City. In 2017, Freier was chosen by The Jerusalem Post, an Israeli newspaper, as #40 of the \\"50 Most Influential Jews\\" in the world. In 2016, she was named one of the \\"15 Most Influential Jews\\" in the world by Makor Rishon, another Israeli newspaper. Also in 2016, Freier's judgeship was selected by Kings County Politics as one of the \\"Top 10 Stories\\" among political events in New York City that year. She was also listed by City & State magazine as one of the \\"Winners\\" among politicians of New York State that year, and was a recipient of Jew in the City's \\"Orthodox Jewish All Stars Award\\".

History The city was founded soon after the arrival of the Romans around 200 AD under Septimius Severus' and became part of the province of Numidia. As a major settlement in the border region, it was significant even then. Its name was apparently bowdlerized by the Romans to Ad Piscƒ´nam (\\"at the piscƒ´na\\"), implying the presence of important waterworks. The city fell to the Arab armies during the end of the 7th century.

At the end of October 2016, a security committee was formed to man checkpoints in the villages and towns it controls. A judicial committee to supervise courts was also established. History The coalition took part in the northern Aleppo offensive, beginning with April 2016, and captured several villages in northern Aleppo overlooking al-Rai from ISIL, before entering al-Rai itself. However, ISIL soon launched a large-scale counteroffensive and recaptured most of the villages, including al-Rai. In early October 2016 the group formed the Akhtarin Military Council which captured several villages and the town of Akhtarin from ISIL as part of the 2016 Dabiq offensive, ending with the capture of Dabiq and several more other villages, linking Mare' with al-Rai. On 28 October the group formed the \\"Victory Bloc\\" operations room during the western al-Bab offensive. On 28 January 2017, after the formation of Tahrir al-Sham which the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement's main branch became part of, the Zenki Movement's northern Aleppo branch working with Hawar Kilis Operations Room defected to the Sham Legion and formed the Revolutionary Knights Brigade. On 7 June 2017, a unit in the Hawar Kilis Operations Room defected to the Syrian Democratic Forces. In July 2017, the commander of Liwa Ahfad Saladin, Mahmoud Khallo, declared that the group would not participate in a planned Turkish-led offensive against the SDF in the Afrin Canton and the Shahba region. Following the announcement, the group was arrested and disarmed by the Levant Front and the Turkish Army. After being released soon after, Khallo protested against his unit's treatment and criticized that Turkey was apparently only interested in using the Syrian militias to further its own strategic goals. He also said that Liwa Ahfad Saladin, now without weapons, would set up a political party. On 26 August 2017, the Hawar Kilis Operations Room condemned Riad al-Asaad and accused him of conspiring with al-Qaeda after he attended a conference held by Tahrir al-Sham in Idlib.

It was based at the port of Buenos Aires and later at Puerto Belgrano, and was decommissioned in 1941. The vessel was named after the Juan Bautista Azopardo, a Maltese privateer and officer of the Argentine Navy during the Independence and Cisplatine wars, and was the second Argentine naval ship with this name.  Design  Azopardo was a steam tugboat built in 1919 at the Bethlehem Co., in Boston. It had a single funnel and two simple masts. It was powered by two triple expansion steam engines of 900 hp each, with two boilers, driving two propellers. It could carry 250 tons of coal, and consumed a maximum of 20 tons of coal per day, giving it a maximum range of 20 days at sea. It was equipped with a \\"Lidgerwood\\" steam engine on its stern, for towing ships. It also had a refrigerated store, and electric searchlights.  History  Azopardo was launched in 1919 in United States, as Barstow. It was transferred to Argentina in 1922 by the US Navigation Board, to compensate for the damages caused by the ship American Legion in the port of Buenos Aires. It was commissioned by the Argentine Navy in December 1922 by O. G. 211/922, and put in service in the port of Buenos Aires. In December 1924 was transferred to Puerto Belgrano.

This translation may have been done in response to Viking raids, which made the Anglo-Saxons believe that they needed to bestow greater honours on the relics of saints to gain God's favour; after the translation took place, the Vikings who were in Devon stayed where they were, and then returned to their base on the Isle of Wight.Studies in the Early history of Shaftesbury Abbey, Dorset County Council, 1999 Shaftesbury was one of several late Saxon churches established in Wessex around this time, along with Winchester Nunnaminster, Romsey, Wherwell, Amesbury and Wilton.

The Papagayo jet, also referred to as the Papagayo Wind or the Papagayo Wind Jet, are strong intermittent winds that blow approximately 70 km north of the Gulf of Papagayo, after which they are named. The jet winds travel southwest from the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean through a pass in the Cordillera mountains at Lake Nicaragua. The jet follows the same path as the northeast trade winds in this region; however, due to a unique combination of synoptic scale meteorology and orographic phenomena, the jet winds can reach much greater speeds than their trade wind counterparts. That is to say, the winds occur when cold high- pressure systems from the North American continent meet warm moist air over the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, generating winds that are then funneled through a mountain pass in the Cordillera. The Papagayo jet is also not unique to this region. There are two other breaks in the Cordillera where this same phenomenon occurs, one at the Chivela Pass in M√©xico and another at the Panama Canal, producing the Tehuano (Tehuantepecer) and the Panama jets respectively. The Papagayo jet also induces mesoscale meteorology phenomena that influence the pacific waters hundreds of kilometers off the Nicaraguan and Costa Rican shores. When the jet wind surges, it creates cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, Ekman transport, and upwelling that contribute to the creation of the Costa Rica Dome off the western coast of Central America in the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool (WHWP). The relatively cold, nutrient-rich waters of the dome, in comparison to the surrounding WHWP, create an ideal habitat for a number of species making the Papagayo Wind Jet important for biodiversity in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. __TOC__  Formation  In North and Central America, during the Northern Hemisphere winter, high-pressure systems are created between the equator and 35th parallels north via atmospheric circulation. Air near the equator is warmed by the sun. This heated air is more buoyant than colder air so it rises and is then pushed poleward by more air rising from below. Once the air reaches northern latitudes it begins to cool and as a result it falls back towards to the Earth's surface. As the air is falling it exerts more pressure downward on the surface, creating a high-pressure systems. This cold, high-pressure air mass then travels equatorward. Air masses repeatedly move in this loop, but due to the Coriolis force, this convection is not perfectly aligned south to north. In actuality, the air moves clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, as it moves from the equator to higher latitudes and then back to the equator again. An NASA satellite image was annotated to demonstrate a cartoon high-pressure system that would influence the formation of the Papagayo jet. The air travelling clockwise off the North American continent is cold and dense, with a high pressure. As it moves southwest over the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, it meets warm, moist air with a comparatively low pressure. This establishes a dramatic pressure gradient, causing the cold, high-pressure air to flow quickly into the low-pressure area. This is analogous to air flowing rapidly out of a balloon when the neck of the balloon is left open. The air in the balloon has a higher pressure than the surrounding air so the air flows out of the balloon until the pressure inside and outside of the balloon is equal. If Central America were topographically flat, the air would flow uninterrupted from the Caribbean to the Pacific Ocean; however, the Cordillera mountains, which run along the west coast of Central America, block this flow. As a result, the air is funneled into a narrow mountain pass near Lake Nicaragua and the Gulf of Papagayo, creating the Papagayo jet. Again, the balloon example serves as an analogy of how the Papagayo jet forms; the air moving out of the balloon cannot escape all at once because there is only a small opening that allows for the release of air. The narrow opening of the balloon facilitates the creation of a wind because the air velocity increases through the balloon neck. Like the wind blowing through the balloon neck, the Papagayo winds reach high speeds as they travel through the break in the Cordillera. For context, Papagayo jet winds have mean speeds of and can reach speeds of up to , in comparison with average trade wind speeds of 25 km/hr. Once the Papagayo jet winds reach the Pacific Ocean they slow considerably and merge with the trade winds. Papagayo wind jet surges can occur intermittently every few weeks and last several days during the Northern Hemisphere winter. The jet is most prominent in the winter months because the pressure gradient is largest between the two air masses during this time of the year. The greater the difference in temperature between the two air masses, the faster the air will flow from an area of high pressure into an area of low pressure. In the spring, summer, and fall months the air mass from the North American continent is much warmer so the resultant air flow is less dramatic and the wind speeds are not as high. In sum, wind speeds in the Papagayo jet will be high through the months of November to March, peaking in February, then they will be reduced from April to August, and finally diminish completely in September.  Influence on the Costa Rica Dome  The Papagayo jet winds are strong enough to influence the ocean waters off the west coast of Central America, namely being one of the factors responsible for the Costa Rica Dome. The Costa Rica Dome is a roughly circular area of anomalously cold water in the eastern tropical Pacific. It has a diameter of approximately 300-500 kilometers and is centered approximately 300 kilometers west of the Gulf of Papagayo. The waters surrounding the dome (known as the Western Hemisphere Warm Pool) are considerably warmer due to heating from the sun, given the region's proximity to the equator. The existence of the Costa Rica Dome can be attributed to a multitude of mesoscale oceanic effects; however, the Papagayo jet plays a considerable role in the size, movement, and continued existence of the dome throughout the year. As the Papagayo winds blow during the winter months they cool the surface ocean water in their path causing the extension of the Costa Rica Dome east (from 300 to approximately 1000 kilometers in diameter) to the Nicaraguan and Costa Rican coastlines. The mechanism for this cooling is explained by the influence of the Papagayo winds on the ocean surface currents. As the winds blow southwest over the Pacific they create cyclonic and anticyclonic coastal eddies on the water surface due to Ekman pumping. These coastal eddies generate the upwelling of cold water from greater ocean depths where the rising cold water then mixes with the warmer water near the surface and subsequently lowers sea surface temperatures. Therefore, the Papagayo jet indirectly cools the coastal waters off the shores of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, extending the Costa Rica Dome. During the winter months, the coastal eddies and by extension the Papagayo jet, are thought to be the primary drivers of the dome. Model simulations indicate that without the Papagayo jet the Costa Rica Dome would not grow to such a large extent and may not even persist year-round.  Impact on Regional Biodiversity  Chlorophyll growth extending off the coast of Lake Nicaragua due to nutrient upwelling by January 2001 Papagayo Jet The Papagayo jet is an important meteorological phenomenon when considering ocean biodiversity in the eastern tropical Pacific. The jet plays a key role in lowering sea surface temperatures, through the influence on the Costa Rica Dome. The movement and growth of the dome is caused by the seasonal variability of the jet where the annual upwelling and mixing caused by the Papagayo jet during dome extension allows for the transport of nutrient-rich cold waters to the surface. If the jet was a permanent feature (and by extension, the dome was also permanent) there would be no seasonal transport of nutrients via cold water upwelling. Indirect evidence of this nutrient transport can be seen in satellite imagery showing increased chlorophyll production in the surface waters directly under the path of the jet. The dome has also shown to be an area with increased zooplankton biomass as well as an area inhabited by blue whales who seem to follow the dome as it migrates in the eastern tropical Pacific waters.

It has smooth grey to brown-tan over creamy grey bark. Its young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section, and leaves that are dull bluish green, egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves are usually dull bluish green, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a peduncle up to long, the individual buds sessile. Mature buds are crowded together, oval, green to yellow, long and wide. Flowering occurs from November to May and the flowers are white. The fruit are woody hemispherical capsules crowded together and flattened on one side. Taxonomy and naming Cong mallee was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham from an unpublished description by Robert Brown who gave it the name Eucalyptus dumosa var. conglobata. The description was published in Flora Australiensis. In 1922, Joseph Maiden raised the variety to species status as Eucalyptus conglobata. In 1972 Ian Brooker described two subspecies, subsp. conglobata as a synonym of Eucalyptus dumosa var. conglobata, and subsp. fraseri. Eucalyptus conglobata (R.Br. ex Benth.) Maiden subsp. conglobata is accepted by the Australian Plant Census. In 2004, Brooker and Andrew Slee described Eucalyptus conglobata subsp. perata, a name that has been accepted by the Australian Plant Census. The specific epithet (conglobata) possibly refers to the clusters of flower buds and fruit. The name perata is from the Latin peratus meaning \\"western\\", referring to the distribution of this subspecies compared to subspecies conglobata. Subspecies conglobata has fruit that are in diameter whereas subspecies perata has narrower leaves, smaller buds and fruit in diameter. Distribution and habitat Cong mallee grows in tall shrubland. Subspecies conglobata is the only subspecies occurring in South Australia where it occurs near Port Lincoln, but is also common between Israelite Bay, Esperance and Salmon Gums. Subspecies perata is common west of Esperance, including in the Stirling Ranges, Fitzgerald River National Park and Ravensthorpe. Where the ranges overlap, it is difficult to distinguish between the two subspecies.

and if anyone understands the two natures in the mystery of Christ in the sense of a division into parts, or if he expresses his belief in the plural natures in the same lord Jesus Christ, God the Word made flesh, but does not consider the difference of those natures, of which he is composed, to be only in the onlooker's mind, a difference which is not compromised by the union (for he is one from both and the two exist through the one) but uses the plurality to suggest that each nature is possessed separately and has a subsistence of its own, let him be anathema. * If anyone confesses a belief that a union has been made out of the two natures divinity and humanity, or speaks about the one nature of God the Word made flesh, but does not understand these things according to what the fathers have taught, namely that from the divine and human natures a union was made according to subsistence, and that one Christ was formed, and from these expressions tries to introduce one nature or substance made of the deity and human flesh of Christ, let him be anathema. * Those who divide (or split up) the mystery of the divine dispensation of Christ and those who introduce into that mystery some confusion are equally rejected and anathematized by the church of God. * If anyone says that Christ is to be worshipped in his two natures, and by that wishes to introduce two adorations, a separate one for God the Word and another for the man; or if anyone, so as to remove the human flesh or to mix up the divinity and the humanity, monstrously invents one nature or substance brought together from the two, and so worships Christ, but not by a single adoration God the Word in human flesh along with his human flesh, as has been the tradition of the church from the beginning, let him be anathema. * If anyone does not confess his belief that our lord Jesus Christ, who was crucified in his human flesh, is truly God and the Lord of glory and one of the members of the holy Trinity, let him be anathema. * If anyone does not anathematize Arius, Eunomius, Macedonius, Apollinarius Nestorius, Eutyches and Origen, their heretical books and all other heretics who have already been condemned and anathematized by the holy, catholic and apostolic church and by the four holy synods which have already been mentioned, and also all those who have thought or now think in the same way as the aforesaid heretics and who persist in their error even to death, let him be anathema. * If anyone defends the heretical Theodore of Mopsuestia, who said that God the Word is one, while quite another is Christ, who was troubled by the passions of the soul and the desires of human flesh, was gradually separated from that which is inferior, and became better by his progress in good works, and could not be faulted in his way of life, and as a mere man was baptized in the name of the Father and the Son and the holy Spirit, and through this baptism received the grace of the holy Spirit and came to deserve sonship and to be adored, in the way that one adores a statue of the emperor, as if he were God the Word, and that he became after his resurrection immutable in his thoughts and entirely without sin. Furthermore, this heretical Theodore claimed that the union of God the Word to Christ is rather like that which, according to the teaching of the Apostle, is between a man and his wife: The two shall become one. Among innumerable other blasphemies he dared to allege that, when after his resurrection the Lord breathed on his disciples and said, Receive the holy Spirit, he was not truly giving them the holy Spirit, but he breathed on them only as a sign. Similarly he claimed that Thomas's profession of faith made when, after his resurrection, he touched the hands and side of the Lord, namely My Lord and my God, was not said about Christ, but that Thomas was in this way extolling God for raising up Christ and expressing his astonishment at the miracle of the resurrection. This Theodore makes a comparison which is even worse than this when, writing about the acts of the Apostles, he says that Christ was like Plato, Manichaeus, Epicurus and Marcion, alleging that just as each of these men arrived at his own teaching and then had his disciples called after him Platonists, Manichaeans, Epicureans and Marcionites, so Christ found his teaching and then had disciples who were called Christians. If anyone offers a defence for this more heretical Theodore, and his heretical books in which he throws up the aforesaid blasphemies and many other additional blasphemies against our great God and saviour Jesus Christ, and if anyone fails to anathematize him and his heretical books as well as all those who offer acceptance or defence to him, or who allege that his interpretation is correct, or who write on his behalf or on that of his heretical teachings, or who are or have been of the same way of thinking and persist until death in this error, let him be anathema. * If anyone defends the heretical writings of Theodoret which were composed against the true faith, against the first holy synod of Ephesus and against holy Cyril and his Twelve Chapters, and defends what Theodoret wrote to support the heretical Theodore and Nestorius and others who think in the same way as the aforesaid Theodore and Nestorius and accept them or their heresy and if anyone, because of them, shall accuse of being heretical the doctors of the church who have stated their belief in the union according to subsistence of God the Word; and if anyone does not anathematize these heretical books and those who have thought or now think in this way, and all those who have written against the true faith or against holy Cyril and his twelve chapters, and who persist in such heresy until they die, let him be anathema. * If anyone defends the letter which Ibas is said to have written to Mari the Persian, which denies that God the Word, who became incarnate of Mary the holy mother of God and ever-virgin, became man, alleging that he was only a man born to her, whom it describes as a temple, as if God the Word was one and the man someone quite different; which condemns holy Cyril as if he were a heretic, when he gives the true teaching of Christians, and accuses holy Cyril of writing opinions like those of the heretical Apollinarius; which rebukes the first holy synod of Ephesus, alleging that it condemned Nestorius without going into the matter by a formal examination; which claims that the twelve chapters of holy Cyril are heretical and opposed to the true faith; and which defends Theodore and Nestorius and their heretical teachings and books. If anyone defends the said letter and does not anathematize it and all those who offer a defence for it and allege that it or a part of it is correct, or if anyone defends those who have written or shall write in support of it or the heresies contained in it, or supports those who are bold enough to defend it or its heresies in the name of the holy fathers of the holy synod of Chalcedon, and persists in these errors until his death, let him be anathema.

or that the divine essence, by the manifestation and evolution of itself becomes all things or, finally, that God is a universal or indefinite being which by self-determination establishes the totality of things distinct in genera, species and individuals, let him be anathema. * If anyone does not confess that the world and all things which are contained in it, both spiritual and material, were produced according to their whole substance out of nothing by God; or holds that God did not create by his will free from all necessity, but as necessarily as he necessarily loves himself; or denies that the world was created for the glory of God, let him be anathema. * If anyone says that the one true God, our creator and lord, cannot be known with certainty from the things that have been made by the natural light of human reason, let him be anathema. * If anyone says that it is impossible (or not expedient) that human beings should be taught by means of divine revelation about God and the worship that should be shown him, let him be anathema. * If anyone says that a human being cannot be divinely elevated to a knowledge and perfection which exceeds the natural but, of himself, can (and must) reach finally the possession of all truth and goodness by continual development, let him be anathema. * If anyone does not receive as sacred and canonical the complete books of sacred scripture with all their parts (as the holy council of Trent listed them) or denies that they were divinely inspired, let him be anathema. * If anyone says that human reason is so independent that faith cannot be commanded by God, let him be anathema. * If anyone says that divine faith is not to be distinguished from natural knowledge about God and moral matters and, consequently, that for divine faith it is not required that revealed truth should be believed because of the authority of God who reveals it, let him be anathema. * If anyone says that divine revelation cannot be made credible by external signs and that, therefore, men and women ought to be moved to faith only by each one's internal experience or private inspiration, let him be anathema. * If anyone says that all miracles are impossible and, therefore, all reports of them (even those contained in sacred scripture) are to be set aside as fables or myths; or that miracles can never be known with certainty, nor the divine origin of the Christian religion be proved from them, let him be anathema. * If anyone says that the assent to Christian faith is not free, but is necessarily produced by arguments of human reason; or that the grace of God is necessary only for living faith which works by charity, let him be anathema. * If anyone says that the condition of the faithful and those who have not yet attained to the only true faith is alike, so that Catholics may have a just cause for calling in doubt (by suspending their assent) the faith which they have already received from the teaching of the church until they have completed a scientific demonstration of the credibility and truth of their faith, let him be anathema. * If anyone says that in divine revelation there are contained no true mysteries properly so-called, but all dogmas of the faith can be understood and demonstrated by properly-trained reason from natural principles, let him be anathema. * If anyone says that human studies are to be treated with such liberty that their assertions may be maintained as true even when they are opposed to divine revelation and they may not be forbidden by the church, let him be anathema. * If anyone says that it is possible that at some time, given the advancement of knowledge, a sense may be assigned to the dogmas propounded by the church which is different from that which the church has understood and understands, let him be anathema. * If anyone says that blessed Peter the apostle was not appointed by Christ the lord as prince of all the apostles and visible head of the whole church militant; or that it was a primacy of honour only and not true and proper jurisdiction which he directly and immediately received from our lord Jesus Christ himself, let him be anathema. * If anyone says that it is not by the institution of Christ the lord himself (that is to say, by divine law) that blessed Peter should have perpetual successors in primacy over the whole church; or that the Roman pontiff is not the successor of blessed Peter in this primacy, let him be anathema. * If anyone says that the Roman pontiff has merely an office of supervision and guidance and not the full and supreme power of jurisdiction over the whole church, and this not only in matters of faith and morals but also in those which concern the discipline and government of the church dispersed throughout the whole world; or that he has only the principal part, but not the absolute fullness, of this supreme power; or that this power of his is not ordinary and immediate over the churches, the pastors and the faithful, let him be anathema. * [We] define as a divinely revealed dogma that when the Roman pontiff speaks ex cathedra [...] such definitions of the Roman pontiff are of themselves, and not by the consent of the church, irreformable. [S]hould anyone, which God forbid, have the temerity to reject this definition of ours: let him be anathema. 1917 Code of Canon Law The first unified code of canon law was produced in 1917, and it replaced all previous rules regarding excommunication which had come from councils and papal documents. The 1983 Code of Canon Law replaced the 1917 code. Therefore, only the 1983 code still has legal standing with regard to excommunicable offences. 1983 Code of Canon Law *Canon 1364 - An apostate from the faith, a heretic, or a schismatic incurs a latae sententiae excommunication. *Canon 1367 - A person who throws away consecrated species, or takes (or retains) them for a sacrilegious purpose, incurs a latae sententiae excommunication reserved to the apostolic see. *Canon 1370 - A person who uses physical force against the Roman pontiff incurs a latae sententiae excommunication reserved to the apostolic see. *Canon 1378 - A priest who acts against the prescript of Canon 977 incurs a latae sententiae excommunication reserved to the apostolic see. (Canon 977 prohibits a priest from giving absolution to someone with whom he has had unlawful carnal relations). *Canon 1382 - A bishop who consecrates a bishop without a pontifical mandate, and the person who receives the consecration, incur a latae sententiae excommunication reserved to the apostolic see. *Canon 1388 - A confessor who directly violates the sacramental seal incurs a latae sententiae excommunication reserved to the apostolic see. *Canon 1398 - A person who procures a completed abortion incurs a latae sententiae excommunication. Canon 1324 includes a number of exceptions from excommunicable offences: *By a person who had only the imperfect use of reason; *By a person who lacked the use of reason because of drunkenness or similar culpable disturbance of mind; *From grave heat of passion which did not precede (and hinder) all deliberation of mind and consent of will, provided that the passion itself had not been stimulated or fostered voluntarily; *By a minor who has not yet completed the age of sixteen years; *By a person who was coerced by grave fear (even if only relatively-grave), or due to necessity or grave inconvenience if the delict is intrinsically evil or tends to the harm of souls; *By a person who acted without due moderation against an unjust aggressor for the sake of legitimate self-defense or defense of another; *Against someone who gravely and unjustly provokes the person; *By a person who thought (in culpable error) that one of the circumstances mentioned in Canon 1323, numbers 4 or 5 was present; *By a person who, without negligence, did not know that a penalty was attached to a law or precept; *By a person who acted without full imputability, provided that the imputability was grave. According to Canon 1329, unnamed accomplices may receive the same penalty when an excommunicable act is committed.

From 1976 to 1987, she worked at the Institute for Design and Construction of Agricultural and Food Production Industries, designing storage facilities, canneries, wineries, slaughterhouses, flour mills and bakeries. She was a member of the team of over 700 architects of the ‚ÄúCarpati‚Äù Design Institute between 1987 and 1990, where she worked as the principal architect on the project ‚ÄúPalace of the People‚Äù in Bucharest. The building was designed by the architect Anca Petrescu in 1983, following a competition that lasted almost 4 years. The controversial 12-storey building, with its 315,000 m¬≤, is the biggest civic administrative building in the world and the second biggest building after the American Pentagon. It is, in addition, considered the most expensive and heaviest administrative building, a project that consumed a third of the wealth of the country. The building was originally meant to house the Romanian Communist Party Headquarters. After the fall of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, the Romanian Parliament Palace occupied it followed, in 1997, by the Museum of Abstract Art, a conference center and other administrative offices. After state- sponsored companies were terminated, CiocƒÉnea was chief architect for PREDA from 1990 to 1994 and later for MACONZ International; during this time, she mainly designed private residences.

An informal and small Chinatown once existed around Monument Square. The first Chinese person arrived in 1858 with the Chinatown forming around 1916, mainly lasting until around 1953. The last vestiges of Chinatown lingered until 1997 when the last Chinese laundry closed. By that time, urban renewal already claimed all of the remaining buildings. History Portland's Chinatown existed modestly, with most Chinese being isolated as a result of discrimination and the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. By 1895, there were enough Chinese people that a Chinese community began to form, though mostly with men whose wives were prohibited from migration by the newly created law. The first Chinese restaurant opened in 1880 at 1 Custom House Wharf. At the time the city only had nine Chinese men. The community celebrated their first Moon Festival on October 8, 1884. Most Chinese men who lived in Chinatown attended the Chinese Sunday school opened by the Second Parish Presbyterian Church in 1888. That Sunday school closed in the late 1890s. The First Baptist Church opened its Chinese Sunday school in 1905. That Sunday school lasted until the mid-1950s. Some members of the First Baptist Church's Sunday school went to China as missionaries. The Maine State Laundrymen's Association formed in January 1903 with more than 100 members to fix prices and bring laundryman together socially. Even though Maine had dozens of Chinese laundries at that time the Association had no Chinese members. By 1920, around 30 Chinese laundries existed in the city. By around the 1950s, the Chinese community had shrunk to the point that Chinatown almost ceased to exist. By 1966 Chin Kow, called \\"The General\\" by his customers and friends, closed Portland's last Chinese laundry wiping out the last remaining vestige of Chinatown.

They have been described by Le Monde as a \\"symbol of a Paris era\\". History In 1931, the first TN model, the TN4, a bus with a length of 9.5 metres, was introduced at the request of Soci√©t√© des transports en commun de la r√©gion parisienne (STCRP), the predecessor of the RATP. The TN4 introduced the radiator in front of the engine instead of behind as used on previous Renault buses. The TN4, more powerful and with a larger capacity (up to 50 passengers) that previous Parisian transports, led to the final decline of the Paris tramway that disappeared in 1937. The first TNs had an open platform. The TN4 introduced versions with various inline-four engines of (TN4A, TN4B, TN4C, TN4F) and received some front-end restyling. In 1932, a TN with an inline-six engine of , the TN6 (also with open platform), was introduced. Its versions (TN6A, TN6C 1 and 2) were used for suburban transport. The TN6C 1 and 2 had a closed platform from 1936 onwards. In 1935 Renault unveiled a new TN4, the TN4H. This 50-passenger bus adopted a closed platform, a longer wheelbase, a forward control cabin and a new suspension. A significant number of TNs were requisitioned by the French military during World War II. The main rival for the TNs during that era was the similar K 63 bus produced by Panhard. After the war, all the TNs in service (6A, 6C2, 4B, 4C, 4E, 4H) were refurbished, resulting in standardised interior fitting and decor. By the 1950s, almost all the TNs had adopted a more closed cabin to protect the driver. The TNs were slowly phased out: TN4B in 1959, the TN6 in 1969, the TN4F in 1970 and the TN4H in 1971.  Model  Solido produced a die-cast model of the TN6C version from the 1960s onward. This model was made of metal and plastic and was to a scale of 1:50.

In tandem with the Lithuanian- language Tiesa, it was the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Lithuania, the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR, and the Council of Ministers of the Lithuanian SSR. After the restoration of Lithuania's independence in 1990, the newspaper became an independent daily under the name Echo Litvy (literally: Echo of Lithuania; ). Its circulation was 79,000 copies in 1981, 26,000 copies in 1993, and 12,000 copies in 1997. It discontinued publication in 2001 due to financial difficulties. History On 10 July 1940, less than a month after the occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union, the newspaper was established as Truzhenik (Worker; ) and was published in Kaunas. It was discontinued on 22 June 1941, the day of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. It was reestablished in Vilnius under the name Sovetskaya Litva on 26 September 1944. It was the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Lithuania, the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR, and the Council of Ministers of the Lithuanian SSR. On 23 February 1990, Sovetskaya Litva was separated from the Communist Party of Lithuania. When Lithuania regained its independence in March 1990, Sovetskaya Litva was renamed to Echo Litvy on 15 March and remained the official newspaper of the Lithuanian government until 1994. It represented the Supreme Council ‚Äì Reconstituent Seimas and the Government of Lithuania in 1990‚Äì92, and the Seimas and the Government in 1992‚Äì94. As the official newspaper, Echo Litvy was obligated to publish adopted and proposed laws which hurt its popularity. The new name Echo Litvy mirrored the Lithuanian-language Lietuvos aidas and there were aborted plans of merging the two dailies. Echo Litvy was the cheapest newspaper in Lithuania. These changes were not accepted by pro-Soviet activists who in March 1990 ‚Äì August 1991 published alternative pro-Moscow Sovetskaya Litva and Lithuanian-language Taryb≈≥ Lietuva. After an order prohibiting the use of the historical name, this alternative newspaper was renamed to Litva Sovetskaya in June 1990. This newspaper was organized by Aleksandras Gelbachas, Vladas Bikuliƒçius, and ≈Ωana Naumova. Initially, the newspapers were printed at a press of the Communist Party of Byelorussia in Minsk. After the main newspaper press at Press Palace was seized on 11 January 1991 (see January Events) and Russian specialists who could operate the press arrived in February, the newspapers were printed in Vilnius. The circulation was 15,800 copies in Russian and 22,000 in Lithuanian in 1990, and 40,000 in Russian and 17,600 in Lithuanian in 1991. In total, 131 issues appeared in Russian and 103 in Lithuanian. Echo Litvy was privatized and became an independent publication. However, it retained its dry tone of an official newspaper and displayed nostalgic tendencies for the Soviet past. It suffered from shrinking readership and financial difficulties and failed to find a wealthy Russian sponsor. During its last year, the circulation was 2,000 copies and 46% of it remained unsold. It discontinued publication on 1 March 2001. The bankruptcy proceedings were started on 12 September 2001 and the company was officially liquidated in May 2003.

There are two main purposes of international advertising research: (1) to assist business executives to make profitable international advertising decisions for their specific products and services and (2) to contribute to general knowledge of international advertising that is potentially useful to a variety of business executives, educators, government policy makers, advertising self-regulatory organizations and others interested in understanding the process and effects international advertising.  Beginnings/makings  In the first 30 years of the 1900s, especially in the prosperous 1920's, increasing numbers of European and US manufactures sold branded consumers or industrial products outside their home countries. Some of them utilized ‚Äùexport advertising agencies\\". Most such agencies depended primarily on foreign agencies (called affiliate,associate,or correspondent agencies)either to modify domestic campaigns or to initiate entirely new campaigns, whichever was appropriate from their clients‚Äô point of view. Export agencies and their foreign affiliates serving international industrial (now called business-to-business) advertisers tended to translate and adapt domestic advertising materials for use abroad. Agencies serving international advertisers of consumer products tended to depend somewhat more on foreign correspondent agencies to develop localized advertising campaigns appropriate for their particular markets. Between 1930 and the mid-1950s the number of export or international advertising agencies declined. In 1958 in the USA six full-service advertising agencies and a handful of export/international advertising agencies were capable of providing international services for their US clients.These six accounted for more than 90% of all international billings of US agencies. Into the 1960s most exporters and manufactures with foreign subsidiaries necessarily continued to utilize local foreign advertising agency services available in the countries in which they did business.In the 1970s and 1980s many consolidations and mergers led to the emergence of large international media buying organizations and large holding companies consisting of groups of international advertising agencies. From the 1980s onward, advertising practices within domestic advertising agencies in Europe and the USA continued to improve.  Global Advertising strategy  Coca-Cola is one of the most influential brands in the world! His personal journey highlights a unique advertising strategy. The Coca-Cola brand has become an ultimate symbol of globalization in the 20th century. Concerning his image, his strategy is simple. In every country of the world, we find the same colors, the same graphics, the same packaging. In order to remain on the world market, the brand adopts a strong communication positioning. Coca-Cola's slogans have evolved a lot. From 1922 until the beginning of World War II, Coca-Cola's goal was to play on the \\"refreshing\\" side of the drink, to make people want to consume. Thus, from 1922 to 1938, the slogans were centered on this sentiment. During the Second World War, Coca-Cola adopted a family-oriented discourse. The goal is to meet with a family around a Coca-Cola. After the Second World War, Coca-Cola returns to the simple values of its product: refreshment. In 1979, the first notion of happiness is evoked in their slogan and then in 2009, the brand will unveil its most popular slogan \\"Open Happiness\\". The drink becomes the reference soda that gives the smile between friends and family. The brand multiplies the communication operations revolving around this universe. With its latest international campaign to give bottles a name, Coca proves to the world that it is capable of deploying such a campaign and creating a global fascination with its brand. A strategy that is more than profitable because it has an impact on the packaging itself, which forces the consumer to obtain the product. In 1982, the brand created the Coca-Cola Light. Consequently, many variations appear and show a true strategy of diversification of the product. With so many types of products, the brand is able to satisfy all types of customers. The Coca Light is especially aimed at women aged 15‚Äì35, so much so that the Coca Zero is more intended for men with its darker colors. Other variations, such as Coca-Cola Cherry or Vanilla make it possible to seduce with other tastes. During the holiday season, Coca-Cola uses father Noel redesigned with the colors of the brand. Its goal is to attract new consumers, children. Santa Claus will be a great help to popularize the drink with young people, especially when one knows that a mascot helps greatly to attract the sympathy of the children. In addition, Santa will also allow the brand to continue communicating even in winter while refresh values are not credible during this season. Coca-Cola is a big fan of street-marketing. With the arrival of Internet, street-marketing clearly took another dimension with the brands. Indeed, the fact of carrying out a direct marketing operation will certainly make it possible to touch the people who are \\"victims\\", but also to viralize the content easily and to a lesser extent on the internet. Coca-Cola is a very big fan of the viral operation. The aim of this type of communication is mainly to retain young people, who will be the first to be affected by the viralization of the operation.  Representative brands of China companies and their development status  Alibaba is a famous company in the world now, especially unlike the disastrous 2012 Facebook (FB,Tech30) IPO on Nasdaq, Alibaba went smoothly on the New York Stock Exchange. Since IPO, Alibaba described the latest business development and strategic objectives to more than 200 global institutional investors and analysts by Jack Ma and all executives. Alibaba group set itself the longterm strategic goals of serving global 10 million profit businesses and 20 million consumers confirmed globalization, rural, big data and cloud computing these three strategies. And thus the formation of electricity providers, finance, logistics, cloud computing, globalization, networking and consumer media seven core business segments. At the same time, also pictures, health, sports, music and other aspects of the layout. Alibaba claimed that international is not equal in foreign business and factories, is not how much money, but to have international ideas and strategies. Some Chinese enterprises have an international facility, but does not mean they are international, some companies do not have to open a company in a foreign country, it does not mean they are not international. Over the past years Alibaba has accumulated some experience, but also want to accumulate some more experience to Chinese enterprises, so that they are used to dealing with business and the world. About fake goods and copycat products, Alibaba has its own point of view. Global brands have long been dependent on China and other low-cost manufacturing markets to boost their profit margins. China has the world‚Äôs largest OEM, but has been the lack of electricity providers such shipping channels. Genuine and fake goods production may be the same plant, their products are not any better than genuine difference, but there is a better price. Brand aspects of intellectual property rights is not a problem, they face a new business model problem.  Advertising in Europe  European consumers are less confident about advertising and brand communication. Several studies show : ‚Ä¢ Earned media, as customer recommendations, editorial content and brand content, is more effective than paid advertising, ‚Ä¢ Confidence in traditional advertising declines, ‚Ä¢ Trust in online and mobile advertising believes that it remains very low, ‚Ä¢ There is a strong regional disparity ‚Ä¢ Advertising targeting still has a long way to go. Beyond these very findings in favor of Inbound Marketing - customers come to the company rather than the company come to them as in the traditional methods of Outbound Marketing. European consumers are particularly skeptical of all forms of communication with the lowest score for each mode of communication compared to other geographical areas. Europeans are therefore less eager to consume than other inhabitants of the planet and much more reluctant to advertise. Marketing and communication agencies must take into account the recommendations they make to clients: more and more Inbound Marketing, but also a more objective and measured communication where consumer interest is at the center of our concerns and the strings of communication.  Common characteristics and cultural differences = Product or Service Offering  In global marketing, a company offers the same products and services across the board, in multiple countries. Think about banks, insurance companies and large retail chains like Wal-Mart. In international marketing, products and services are tailored to specific countries. Think about Sharia finance products, which are only offered in Islamic countries or to Muslim customers in non-Muslim countries ‚Äì or meat that is banned from Israeli or Muslim diet.  Marketing Staff  Global marketing personnel tend to work at the company‚Äôs headquarters and generally are a diverse group of people. They possess various skills that collectively mesh well together, and take a global view of the company‚Äôs market. Conversely, in international marketing, team members tend to hail exclusively from the same country or a country with linguistic or cultural affinity with the primary country.  Marketing Budget  The budget of a global marketing team is managed directly from the corporate headquarters. For example, Nike sets a global marketing budget, which then trickles down to local offices. In international marketing, however, budget issues are negotiated and handled at the local level, within the subsidiary. Take for example McDonald, which runs local ads, some of which you will never see in another country.  Promotion Tactics  When it comes to promotion tactics, global marketing teams try to run ads and other communication ploys that are in sync with a global audience. An excellent way to understand is to see ads that were run during the 2014 FIFA World Cup ‚Äì a perfect mix for global marketing: global sports event, billions of viewers, one passion for the game. In international marketing, commercials and other promotion tactics are tailored for the local market.  Operational Autonomy  Marketing does not mean you sit in a corner office and think about how to sell a product. The typical marketing mix has four components, what experts call the 4Ps: product, price, promotion and place (of distribution). So in terms of operational autonomy, global marketing teams tend to run everything from A to Z, from the corporate headquarters, whereas international marketing teams handle things domestically.  Social Media  By reviewing their social media pages, you can quickly see which companies favor global marketing over international marketing ‚Äì and vice versa. For example, you will notice that McDonald adopts an international marketing strategy, with Facebook pages as diverse as McDonald‚Äôs Malaysia, McDonald‚Äôs Brazil, McDonald‚Äôs Italia and McDonald‚Äôs Polska (Poland). Conversely, Nike or Caterpillar runs a single page.  Customer Engagement  Customer engagement is more active in international marketing. By setting multiple communication channels, a company can better engage with fans and customers at a local level. That is not to say that global marketing is less effective when it comes to customer engagement ‚Äì the tactics are just different. But it is clear that international marketing tends to produce a higher level of engagement than global marketing.  Advertising  In global marketing, commercials are run all over the world, whereas international marketing favors ad airing in the local market exclusively ‚Äì or in similar markets, at most. Some products lend themselves pretty well to global advertising. We already talked about sport gear; you also have movies and songs as well as technology products. Other products, conversely, cannot exist in some countries because of cultural prohibition or legal censorship.  Market Research and R&D;  Market research and R&D; are as deep and broad in global marketing as they are in international marketing. Sometimes, though, global marketing can produce big flops when market research has not properly conducted or local customs thoroughly studied. Think, for example, of Chevy Nova‚Äôs and Mazda LaPuta‚Äôs unfortunate stints in the Spanish market (in Spanish, ‚Äòno va‚Äô and ‚Äòla puta‚Äô mean ‚Äòit doesn‚Äôt go‚Äô and ‚Äòthe whore,‚Äô respectively.). Other product flops include the Ben-Gay aspirin, McDonald‚Äôs Arch Deluxe, and the Cocaine Energy Drink produced by Redux Beverages.  Hybrid Structure  Our number 10 example is not really an example of comparative global marketing vs. international marketing analysis, but an illustration of how a hybrid structure ‚Äì international and global ‚Äì can help companies succeed. Coca-Cola used that mixed tactic effectively in the earlier days, and is nowadays followed by every company, from Mercedes Benz to Frito Lay to Procter & Gamble to McDonald's. Every culture could benefit from Nike, since shoes are a benefit to everyone with feet (which is virtually everyone). The same is true of Caterpillar, since industrial machinery helps to advance mankind in general through more efficient construction. On the other hand, if it is a product that only serves one sub-set of people, or otherwise excludes certain subsets, then an \\"international marketing\\" approach is necessary. Companies with risqu√© or culturally insensitive products can't use the same approach everywhere. For example, alcohol and lingerie companies wouldn't have much fortune in many middle eastern companies where drinking and dressing inappropriately are not widely viewed as acceptable. Cigarette companies would need to modify their message for more socially conscious populations. In these scenarios, international marketing would work better and either no marketing, or specifically tailored marketing would be of greater benefit.  The influence of the internet  The digital culture creates new codes that must be understood in order to be able to use them effectively. We know that in the past, the professional rhythm was dictated by the seasons, that the basic needs were to sleep, drink and eat. Today they remain the same, we want to love and be loved, create and feel useful, give meaning. The digital has not changed our needs, it is the means that allow them to satisfy them by avoiding the constraints that evolved. Like any revolution, the era of digital revolution has disrupted culture, as Gutenberg's printing press has allowed the mass distribution of information. At the moment, everything is faster, access to the media, culture, applications, social networks, trends, information... Everything is accessible, just a click and curiosity takes precedence. Digital techniques reserve us experiences from everyday life. One can travel in space, anywhere in the world through Google Maps, sometimes even inside some buildings. You can make videoconferences at the other end of the earth, create material using 3D or use Augmented Reality to try out the fighter plane. Everything becomes possible and within everyone's reach. And that, brands take it into account in their strategy. The relationship with the other has evolved, a digital identity specific to each one is born of the digital, the encounters are reversed, the quality of the links different, one broadens his personal network. From the point of view of the brand, understanding consumer behavior on the Internet is paramount when it affects its real life. Virtual products flourish, dematerialized purchases take the place and production relocates. Digital affects economy as such. The organization of the structures is modified, we want to tell and create more stories. We are witnessing the birth of a network model. Five years ago, it was still non-existent, it is to say the speed at which the digital evolves with its time. Before digital, communication was a one-way tool. The brand sent a message to the consumer and there was no return, no interaction and exchange. Digital has distorted this practice, it has created new specialized trades like Community Management which is capital for a brand. The speed of information has increased, we are witnessing an amplification of it, a decontextualization at times. The power of algorithms influences automation, holding information is good, what one needs to be more thoughtful. The place of the consumer is different on the Internet but it remains at the center of the strategy.

Said sound, unfortunately, becomes a lot more derivative and less interesting as the years pass, the college rock energy and grit that initially attracted fans not as well represented in songs like \\"All,\\" \\"Bettadaze,\\" and \\"Gimme.\\" As The Essential is slightly more in-depth than the 1998 'best-of' The Best Things, though some of the later tracks are different, it doesn't add much interest for a fan of the band, but it does‚Äîand is intended to‚Äîact as a primer on a group that was often overlooked outside of Australia, and in that it succeeds.\\"  Track listing  # \\"Great Wall\\" (Dale Ryder, Richard Pleasance) - 3:46 # \\"Hands Up in the Air\\" (Peter Farnan, Richard Pleasance) - 3:55 # \\"City Flat\\" (Peter Farnan, Richard Pleasance) - 4:09 # \\"Her Charity\\" (Peter Farnan, Richard Pleasance) - 5:00 # \\"Love Me to Death\\" (Richard Pleasance, Peter Farnan) - 4:28 # \\"Onion Skin\\" (Peter Farnan) - 3:28 # \\"Get Out of the House!\\" (Greg O'Connor, Dale Ryder,Peter Farnan; Peter Maslen, Richard Pleasance) - 3:19 # \\"The Best Thing\\" (Richard Pleasance) - 4:14 # \\"Dancing in the Storm\\" (Richard Pleasance, Peter Farnan) - 4:12 # \\"Mountain of Strength\\" (Dale Ryder, Peter Maslen, Richard Pleasance; Greg O'Connor; Peter Farnan) - 4:09 # \\"Talk About It\\" (Richard Pleasance) - 4:03 # \\"End Up Where I Started\\" (Peter Farnan; Richard Pleasance) - 3:13 # \\"Holy Water\\" (Greg O'Connor, Peter Maslen, Richard Pleasance, Dale Ryder, Peter Farnan) - 3:56 # \\"Bettadaze\\" (Peter Farnan, Greg O'Connor, Dale Ryder) - 3:59 # \\"In the Morning\\" (Peter Farnan, Greg O'Connor) - 3:57 # \\"This Isn't Love\\" (Dale Ryder) - 3:30 # \\"Gimme\\" (Ian Tilley, Peter Farnan) - 3:36 # \\"Dreaming Up a Fire\\" (Richard Pleasance, Peter Farnan) - 3:44 # \\"All\\" (Peter Maslen, Peter Farnan, Ian Tilley) - 4:12  References  Category:2007 greatest hits albums Category:Boom Crash Opera albums Category:Sony BMG compilation albums Category:Compilation albums by Australian artists ","title":"The Essential Boom Crash Opera"},{"id":"52137347","title":"Love Weaves Through a Millennium"},{"id":"52137376","text":"Merzlikin () is a Russian masculine surname, its feminine counterpart is Merzlikina.

K. Raghavendra (born 24 December 1954, Bengaluru) is an Indian film/literary scholar, theorist, critic and writer who had, till 2016, authored six volumes on cinema, and contributed to numerous newspapers and periodicals in India and outside. He received the Swarna Kamal, the National Award for Best Film Critic in 1997.  Early writing  MK Raghavendra, who has a master's degree in science and worked for over two decades in the financial sector, first attracted attention as a film critic when he became co-founder of the film journal Deep Focus, the other co-founders being AL Georgekutty, MU Jayadev and Babu Subramanian, who all wrote their first critical pieces on cinema for the journal around 1987‚Äì88. With AL Georgekutty as editor, Deep Focus was launched in December 1987 and made an immediate impact for the seriousness of its approach. The journal began as a quarterly but became irregular thereafter, sometimes coming out with only a single issue in an entire year. But Raghavendra was especially prolific in Deep Focus with his essays and reviews. Some of his major essays for Deep Focus were: ‚ÄòUrbanisation and Rootlessness: Adoor‚Äôs Drifters in Perspective‚Äô,Deep Focus: A Film Quarterly, Vol.1, No.I, December 1997 pp 2-10. ‚ÄòThe Lost World of Andrei Tarkovsky‚Äô ,Deep Focus: A Film Quarterly, Vol.1, No.IV, January 1989, pp32-41.‚ÄòRW Fassbinder: Notes on the Cinema of an Actor-Director‚Äô ,Deep Focus: A Film Quarterly, Vol.3, No.III, 1990, pp16-28.‚ÄòTime and the Popular Film‚Äô ,Deep Focus: A Film Quarterly, Vol.4, No.I, 1992, pp10-18.‚ÄòGeneric Elements and the Conglomerate Narrative‚Äô ,Deep Focus: A Film Quarterly, Vol.4, No.II, 1992, pp 21-33.‚ÄòThe Sins of a Pioneer: Satyajit Ray Re-examined‚Äô ,Deep Focus: A Film Quarterly, Vol.6, 1996, pp 39-47. ‚ÄòThe River as History: Ritwik Ghatak's Titash Ekti Nadir Naam' ,Deep Focus: A Film Quarterly, Vol.8, No.I &II;, 1998, pp 87-90. and ‚ÄòThe Dilemmas of Third World Cinema‚Äô. Part of this writing played a role in fetching him the National Award in 1997.Deep Focus: A Film Quarterly, July‚ÄìDecember 2002, pp 51-62. With Deep Focus becoming irregular, Raghavendra contributed a series of book reviews to the (now defunct) Indian Review of Books, published from Madras (now Chennai). Apart from reviewing books on film and media, he also took to reviewing fiction. Some of the writers he reviewed or wrote essays about were: Raja Rao, Salman Rushdie, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Shobha De, Kiran Nagarkar, Vikram Seth, K V Puttappa, U R Ananthamurthy, SL Bhyrappa, Shivarama Karanth and Donald Ritchie (on Akira Kurosawa). Other subjects on which he wrote in the Indian Review of Books in the 1990s included American noir and science fiction. Since then he has also contributed book reviews to The Book Review, Caravan, The Hindu, Biblio: A Review of Books, Indian Economic & Social History Review and Economic and Political Weekly.  Theorizing on popular cinema  Based on the work he had already done as a writer/ critic, Raghavendra was selected for a Homi Bhabha Fellowship in 1999, with the two-year scholarship to commence from January 2000. The subject chosen for his research was ‚ÄòGlobalization and its effect on Indian popular film narrative.‚Äô He completed his research in 2001 as scheduled but it took him several years to complete his first book on cinema. Seduced by the Familiar: Narration and Meaning in Indian Popular Cinema Seduced by the Familiar: Narration and Meaning in Indian Popular Cinema, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2008. was published by Oxford University Press in 2008 and partly developed on two essays written in Deep Focus. Seduced by the Familiar represents Raghavendra's first extended effort to understand popular cinema in a new way ‚Äì i.e. neither as the output of authorial presences in the shape of directors nor as symptoms of psychological/social processes (psychoanalysis/ cultural studies) but rather as bodies of texts co- authored by a public to deal with socio-political concerns of their own. In film academics it departed from the work of scholars like M Madhava Prasad M Madhava Prasad, Ideology of the Hindi Film, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1999. by putting the theory-down approach aside and concentrating empirically on the formal/ narrative strategies used by the mainstream Hindi film to sustain the nation as an ‚Äòimagined community‚Äô (in Benedict Anderson'sBenedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, London: Verso, 1983. terms). Seduced by the Familiar, which eschews the usual jargon associated with academic writing on cinema and tries to be lucid, and is also important for two other things ‚Äì an elaborate introduction charting the trajectory of scholarship on the mainstream Hindi film and a first chapter dealing with ‚Äònarrative convention and form‚Äô. This chapter MK Raghavendra, Seduced by the Familiar: Narration and Meaning in Indian Popular Cinema, pp 24-68. remains the only rigorous attempt at defining an aesthetic for the Hindi popular film and relating it to traditional aesthetics, poetics and dramaturgy in India. Here is a passage pertaining to portrayal of devotion in the popular Hindi film: ‚ÄúThe idols worshipped in Hindu temples are conceived as objects of devotion and, while the Hindu gods are anthropomorphic, these idols are often mere cult symbols that do not imitate human proportions with any particular faithfulness. While the contention that idols are ‚Äòsymbolic‚Äô may be contested, what is pertinent here is only that actual idols do not imitate human proportions faithfully. (Madhava) Prasad invokes the tradition of darsana in Hindu worship where muteness on the part of the devotee and mediation by a priest are pre- requisites but devout moments in Hindi films do not follow this prescription. The devoutness in popular cinema is usually directed towards idols that are sculpted in a (naturalistic, Western) way that makes their human attributes manifest. These gods are sometimes muscular and seem capable of movement where traditional idols are solid in their immobility. Where the object of worship in a usual Shiva temple is a sculpted lingam (a stone phallus) a Shiva temple in a popular film enshrines a ‚Äòlifelike‚Äô statue of the god. This does not mean that we do not see lingams in popular cinema. As an instance, the pre-title sequence in Satyam Shivam Sundaram (1978) shows people worshipping a wayside stone shaped like a lingam ‚Äì to demonstrate that it is faith that renders the object of worship sacred. Yet, application to the divine in Satyam Shivam Sundaram is always made to anthropomorphic deities (usually Krishna and Radha) and devotion is also directed towards them in the song sequences. In many other films, the scenes are shot and edited during the devotee's address as though an actual dialogue was in progress. The entreating face of the character is cut to the reassuring countenance of the idol (often employing the eye-line match and shot-reverse shot editing) and the general sense is that there is a communion between the two‚Ä¶. the intention is not to introduce a god to 'control psychic dispositions' but one actually more mindful of material claims. What is presented is not only an icon more reassuring to the spectator but an accessible deity capable of intervening with human understanding in human stories\\"Ibid, pp 63-4. Seduced by the Familiar has gained a following over the years and the paperback edition came out in 2015. In 2011 MK Raghavendra used the same discursive strategies on the Kannada film in another book also published by Oxford University Press ‚Äì Bipolar Identity: Region, Nation and the Kannada Language Film. Kannada cinema ostensibly caters to audiences across Karnataka but this book demonstrates that it began by addressing those from the Princely State of Mysore before 1947 and continues, largely, to confine its address to the same territory. The approach of this book is therefore to examine Kannada cinema as local cinema addressing a public with 'dual identities', as it were, with loyalties to two different 'imagined communities' ‚Äì those of former Mysore and of independent India, which often come into conflict. While the enquiry finds similarities between Hindi and Kannada cinema in terms of their respective grammar, there are nonetheless significant differences which come in the way of Kannada films being remade as Hindi films as easily as Tamil and Telugu films are. These differences lie partly in Kannada cinema coming from a smaller society in which caste plays a more defining role, marriages being contracted within endogamous circles (translating into 'arranged marriages' in narratives) and the territory being a former monarchy (under indirect British rule) with historical memories associated with it. The book also offers an explanation for the political importance of the Kannada film star Rajkumar. Seduced by the Familiar covers the whole of Hindi cinema from before1947 up till 2000 and Bipolar Identity looks at Kannada cinema over roughly the same period, associating the changing motifs with the region's social history. The book is likely to remain the definitive enquiry into the social meaning of Kannada cinema for some time.  The politics of Hindi cinema  Both Seduced by the Familiar and Bipolar Identity are interested in the way social and political history are dealt with by film narrative and demonstrate that allegory is usually the chosen method. The books do not depend on Frederic Jameson's formulation that all 'Third World' texts should be read as national allegories but are independent enquiries which even throw some doubt on the entirety of Jameson's proposition. In the first place Indian films appear to function as allegories even before the 'nation' comes into existence (i.e. before 1947) and secondly, they are not always 'national' allegories but can also function as allegories of smaller territories ‚Äì like the princely state of Mysore. Both books demonstrate how films follow or respond to social history but they do not look at how the films are themselves political or ideological tools. MK Raghavendra's slant on the politics of popular cinema changed significantly when he commenced to write for the Economic and Political Weekly (EPW) beginning with a piece on Rang De Basanti. Between 2009 and 2012 he wrote several essays for EPW (commentary section), on Kaminey, 3 Idiots, Raajneeti, Peepli (Live), Dabangg, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara and Paan Singh Tomar. Ideology is a common aspect of mainstream Hindi cinema to engage researchers but where Raghavendra's writing differs is in his abandoning the theory-down (usually post-Marxist) approach and relying on textual analysis and looking at the internal dynamics of each text. Following his writing in EPW, he undertook the exercise of charting out the politics of mainstream Hindi cinema after 2000 with the neo-liberalist regime firmly in place. With the multiplex boom and the Anglophone Indian's economic importance because of globalisation and his/her being targeted because of his/her spending power, the issue was what direction Hindi cinema was taking, especially since it had been a national cinema after 1947. Could the nation addressed by the mainstream Hindi film be as inclusive as it had once been? His book The Politics of Hindi Cinema in the New Millennium: Bollywood and the Anglophone Indian Nation appeared in 2014. Here is a political assessment from the concluding chapter which draws on textual evidence from mainstream Hindi cinema: ‚ÄúGlobalization and its economic outcome have divided Indian society as never before, with a globally attuned public in the metropolises finding itself closer to the Western world than it is to rural India. Since economic liberalization has been interpreted as licensed Darwinism, this (largely Anglophone) public has shut out the rest of India from its consciousness except as the Nation‚Äôs baggage. At the same time, (from the evidence of Dabangg) those in the semi-urban or rural areas are falling back to dependence on traditional power structures to which the weak state has lent authority. Economic liberalization was expected to create ‚Äòtrickle-down‚Äô benefits to the marginalized but much of the ‚Äòtrickle-down‚Äô affluence has further strengthened these informal power structures. The scenario is strikingly feudal but where feudal power once resided in the ownership of land, land is a depleting resource and its ownership may not confer the greatest degree of power. Power therefore comes out of political patronage, connections with state authority, and one's hereditary position in caste hierarchy.‚Äù  Popular criticism  The work hitherto described is academic criticism but MK Raghavendra has also written articles/criticism for the lay reader in newspapers and periodicals like Deccan Herald, The Hindu, Caravan, Frontline, The Indian Express, Pioneer, Times of India and online publications like The Wire, Firstpost and Dearcinema. His first book of popular criticism was published by Collins in 2009‚Äì50 Indian Film Classics,MK Raghavendra, 50 Indian Film Classics, Noida: Collins, 2009. which had individual essays dealing with a whole range of films from Franz Osten's Light of Asia a.k.a. Prem Sanyas (1925) to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's Rang De Basanti (2006). The collection of essays includes fiction features in a multitude of languages and genres, with examples as different as Salaam Bombay (Mira Nair, 1988), Samskara (Pattabhirama Reddy, 1970), Imagi Ningthem (Aribam Syam Sharma, 1981) and Amar Akbar Anthony (Manmohan Desai, 1977). Instead of adopting a uniform method, the essays examine each film from its most interesting side ‚Äì e.g.: Kamal Amrohi's Pakeezah for its baroque aesthetic, Adoor Gopalakrishnan's Mukhamukham for its authorial perspective, and K Vishwanath's Telugu dance-musical Sankarabharanam for its ideological aspects. MK Raghavendra followed up 50 Indian Film Classics with a companion piece also from Collins. In Director's Cut: 50 Film-makers of the Modern Era (2013) he examines the work of film directors from across the world, but restricting his attention to those who produced notable work after 1960. The sixties were the years in which the French New Wave came of age and Raghavendra argues that the decade broadly marks the arrival of the ‚Äòmodern‚Äô in cinema. Also, while the earlier film-makers ‚Äì from Eistenstein to Hitchcock have been written about extensively, those more recent ones ‚Äì like Bela Tarr from Hungary, Abbas Kiarostami from Iran and Sergei Paradjanov from the USSR have not had their work interpreted widely. The collection includes essays on five truly international Indian film-makers: Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak, Adoor Gopalakrishnan, G Aravindan and Raj Kapoor. Here is a passage from the essay on Ghatak: ‚ÄúApart from the sense of people living makeshift lives almost permanently Ghatak opens out the frame of his story (in Meghe Dhaka Tara) to admit detail that suggests a larger world not contained by the story. One motif is the train that features in several segments ‚Äì including one or two in which Shankar practices music. If one were to compare Ghatak's train with Ray's in Pather Panchali, one could say that where Ray's is an emblem of the 'new', Ghatak's train is something that people have actually travelled in, perhaps from the homes they abandoned forever. Another device of Ghatak's is to have musical numbers in spaces open to the elements. Shankar and Neeta sing a duet in the film ‚Äì a Tagore song ‚Äì as if to recall a happier time or to wish for the way things might have been, sung under a thatched roof in a settlement. Tagore's songs are among the most cherished elements of Bengal's heritage and the sad irony that it should be sung under makeshift circumstances makes the sequence profoundly moving. In Subarnarekha (1962) Ghatak goes a step further and has the heroine rendering a song in an actual historical space ‚Äì a dilapidated World War II airfield.‚Äù  Distinctions  When MK Raghavendra received the National Award in 1997 the citation read as follows: ‚ÄúFor his provocative and iconoclastic writing, which inspires debate and discussion, so rare in film criticism today.‚Äù The same ‚Äòprovocative‚Äô tendencies continue to mark his later writing although he tries to be less judgmental. Why something is the way it (i.e. its socio-political implications) is more important than its value as cinema, is increasingly his emphasis. He was invited by Goethe Institut, Munich, July/ August 2000 to study post-war German Cinema, and his essay 'German Cinema at the Crossroads' was put on the internal web page of Goethe Instiut. He was also one of the two India-based film critics invited to participate in Sight and Sound, London, 2002 poll for greatest films of all time. His rise to stature as a scholar- critic has been increasingly acknowledged after his Homi Bhabha Fellowship. FIPRESCI the international federation of film critics included Seduced by the Familiar and 50 Indian Film Classics in its list of the Best Books on Cinema worldwide. When Oxford India decided to add 'Bollywood' to their list of 'Short Introductions' in 2016, he was asked to write the book, indicative of his growing authority in the field.

The 95-floor building is topped with a , 12-storey high illuminated crown making it tall.https://www.skyscrapercenter.com/building/the- exchange-106/24971 The tower will have a net lettable area of and is benchmarked against similar buildings in large international financial centers, such as London's Canary Wharf and The Shard, New York's Freedom Tower, and Shanghai IFC. As of October 2019, about 500,000 square feet of Exchange 106's floor space has been taken up by large tenants, including a top five Fortune 500 global consulting firm and some of the world's most recognized e-commerce platforms. The floor space is column-less, ranges from .  Proposal and development  The skyscraper was first conceptualised when TRX was controlled by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a fund owned by the Malaysian government. On 13 May 2015, 1MDB Real Estate Sdn Bhd (1MDB RE), the master developer of TRX, and the Mulia Group announced that, through Mulia Property Development Sdn Bhd, they had signed a Sale and Purchase agreement for the development rights of the plot of land for the Exchange 106 (then known as the Signature Tower), with the land transacted at a value of RM665 million. Ground work on the Exchange 106 plot commenced on 1 March 2016, with the mat concrete foundation laid in May 2016 (see \\"Progress\\" section below).  Progress  The Exchange 106 was wholly project managed by the Mulia Group, with structural construction carried out by the China State Construction Engineering Corporation, through its Malaysian subsidiary China State Construction Engineering (M) Sdn. Bhd. Exchange 106 (June 2018) In May 2016, the tower's foundation concrete pour took place over a weekend, and was the second largest continuous concrete pour in the world. Construction of the tower broke the local construction speed record by having completed a single floor in only two days at its peak. In December 2017, the building was structurally topped out, 19 months after commencement, achieving an average of 3 days a floor. Work to complete the building continued in spite of uncertainties that arose with the change of government during the 2018 Malaysian general election held on 9 May 2018. In June 2018 the Malaysian government agreed to inject RM2.8 billion into the Tun Razak Exchange (of which The Exchange 106 is a part) in order to complete the project after discovering money was misappropriated to pay the debts of 1Malaysia Development Berhad. Exchange 106 achieved its Certificate of Completion and Compliance in September 2019. The construction of the TRX's shopping mall (called The Exchange) which is located at the foot of the Exchange 106 is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2021.https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2019/06/04/shopping- mall-at-trx-to-be-ready-by-q3-2021/#IVdu32wmt3l0ij2F.99 TRX shopping mall, located at the foot of The Exchange 106, under construction in May 2019.

Although silencing of some genes in cancers occurs by mutation, a large proportion of carcinogenic gene silencing is a result of altered DNA methylation (see DNA methylation in cancer). DNA methylation causing silencing in cancer typically occurs at multiple CpG sites in the CpG islands that are present in the promoters of protein coding genes. Altered expressions of microRNAs also silence or activate many genes in progression to cancer (see microRNAs in cancer). Altered microRNA expression occurs through hyper/hypo- methylation of CpG sites in CpG islands in promoters controlling transcription of the microRNAs. Silencing of DNA repair genes through methylation of CpG islands in their promoters appears to be especially important in progression to cancer (see methylation of DNA repair genes in cancer). CpG islands in promoters In humans, about 70% of promoters located near the transcription start site of a gene (proximal promoters) contain a CpG island. CpG islands are generally 200 to 2000 base pairs long, have a C:G base pair content >50%, and have regions of DNA where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide and this occurs frequently in the linear sequence of bases along its 5‚Ä≤ ‚Üí 3‚Ä≤ direction. Genes may also have distant promoters (distal promoters) and these frequently contain CpG islands as well. An example is the promoter of the DNA repair gene ERCC1, where the CpG island-containing promoter is located about 5,400 nucleotides upstream of the coding region of the ERCC1 gene. CpG islands also occur frequently in promoters for functional noncoding RNAs such as microRNAs. Transcription silencing due to methylation of CpG islands In humans, DNA methylation occurs at the 5‚Ä≤ position of the pyrimidine ring of the cytosine residues within CpG sites to form 5-methylcytosines. The presence of multiple methylated CpG sites in CpG islands of promoters causes stable inhibition (silencing) of genes. Silencing of transcription of a gene may be initiated by other mechanisms, but this is often followed by methylation of CpG sites in the promoter CpG island to cause the stable silencing of the gene. Transcription silencing/activation in cancers In cancers, loss of expression of genes occurs about 10 times more frequently by transcription silencing (caused by promoter hypermethylation of CpG islands) than by mutations. As Vogelstein et al. point out, in a colorectal cancer there are usually about 3 to 6 driver mutations and 33 to 66 hitchhiker or passenger mutations. In contrast, in colon tumors compared to adjacent normal-appearing colonic mucosa, there are about 600 to 800 heavily methylated CpG islands in promoters of genes in the tumors while these CpG islands are not methylated in the adjacent mucosa. Using gene set enrichment analysis, 569 out of 938 gene sets were hypermethylated and 369 were hypomethylated in cancers. Hypomethylation of CpG islands in promoters results in increased transcription of the genes or gene sets affected. One study listed 147 specific genes with colon cancer-associated hypermethylated promoters and 27 with hypomethylated promoters, along with the frequency with which these hyper/hypo-methylations were found in colon cancers. At least 10 of those genes had hypermethylated promoters in nearly 100% of colon cancers. They also indicated 11 microRNAs whose promoters were hypermethylated in colon cancers at frequencies between 50% and 100% of cancers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNAs that pair with sequences in messenger RNAs to direct post-transcriptional repression. On average, each microRNA represses or inhibits transcriptional expression of several hundred target genes. Thus microRNAs with hypermethylated promoters may be allowing enhanced transcription of hundreds to thousands of genes in a cancer. Transcription inhibition and activation by nuclear microRNAs For more than 20 years, microRNAs have been known to act in the cytoplasm to degrade transcriptional expression of specific target gene messenger RNAs (see microRNA history). However, recently, Gagnon et al. showed that as many as 75% of microRNAs may be shuttled back into the nucleus of cells. Some nuclear microRNAs have been shown to mediate transcriptional gene activation or transcriptional gene inhibition. DNA repair genes with hyper/hypo-methylated promoters in cancers DNA repair genes are frequently repressed in cancers due to hypermethylation of CpG islands within their promoters. In head and neck squamous cell carcinomas at least 15 DNA repair genes have frequently hypermethylated promoters; these genes are XRCC1, MLH3, PMS1, RAD51B, XRCC3, RAD54B, BRCA1, SHFM1, GEN1, FANCE, FAAP20, SPRTN, SETMAR, HUS1, and PER1. About seventeen types of cancer are frequently deficient in one or more DNA repair genes due to hypermethylation of their promoters. As summarized in one review article, promoter hypermethylation of the DNA repair gene MGMT occurs in 93% of bladder cancers, 88% of stomach cancers, 74% of thyroid cancers, 40%-90% of colorectal cancers and 50% of brain cancers. Promoter hypermethylation of LIG4 occurs in 82% of colorectal cancers. This review article also indicates promoter hypermethylation of NEIL1 occurs in 62% of head and neck cancers and in 42% of non-small-cell lung cancers; promoter hypermetylation of ATM occurs in 47% of non-small-cell lung cancers; promoter hypermethylation of MLH1 occurs in 48% of squamous cell carcinomas; and promoter hypermethylation of FANCB occurs in 46% of head and neck cancers. On the other hand, the promoters of two genes, PARP1 and FEN1, were hypomethylated and these genes were over-expressed in numerous cancers. PARP1 and FEN1 are essential genes in the error-prone and mutagenic DNA repair pathway microhomology-mediated end joining. If this pathway is over-expressed, the excess mutations it causes can lead to cancer. PARP1 is over-expressed in tyrosine kinase-activated leukemias, in neuroblastoma, in testicular and other germ cell tumors, and in Ewing's sarcoma, FEN1 is over-expressed in the majority of cancers of the breast, prostate, stomach, neuroblastomas, pancreatic, and lung. DNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer. If accurate DNA repair is deficient, DNA damages tend to accumulate. Such excess DNA damage can increase mutational errors during DNA replication due to error-prone translesion synthesis. Excess DNA damage can also increase epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations can give rise to cancer (see malignant neoplasms). Thus, CpG island hyper/hypo-methylation in the promoters of DNA repair genes are likely central to progression to cancer.

In computer vision his early work on 3D recovery of dynamic scenes through virtualized reality has resulted in tremendous growth in 3D capture to be available to end users. Capture of 3D has now become common place through the Microsoft Kinect and other commodity sensors. He pioneered the use of innovative platforms like the GPU for common computer vision applications such as graph cuts, neural networks, clustering etc. Use of the GPU in computer vision has culminated in the GPUs making Deep Learning practical for several applications. His work on general parallel computing involving CPUs and GPUs has also been recognized worldwide.

A 23- to 25-year-old man \\"of southern appearance\\" was named as the suspect. On 30 October 2016, the Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility for the attack, though police later said a terrorist background or motive for the attack was \\"unlikely\\". Attack In the evening of 16 October 2016, a 16-year-old boy, named by the police as Viktor E., was stabbed near the Kennedybr√ºcke, (Kennedy bridge), over the Alster lake in Hamburg at around 10:00 p.m. His 15-year-old girlfriend, who was sitting with him on the stairs near the waterfront, was also thrown into the water by the assailant. She managed to swim to the shore again while the perpetrator ran away. Viktor E. died in the hospital shortly afterwards. His girlfriend was not injured. Investigation Though the police dispersed flyers, no eyewitnesses were initially found, while divers attempted to find the knife in the water, but to no avail. The police agency admitted that it had no knowledge about the possible motivation of the perpetrator. On 27 October, police tried to reconstruct the murder at the crime scene. Specialists investigated the location of the crime scene again using metal detectors. On 30 October, it was reported that IS had claimed responsibility for the attack. Their news website Amaq claimed that a \\"soldier of the caliphate\\" had carried out the stabbing. Hamburg police confirmed the claim, and acknowledged that federal security authorities (Staatsschutz) were involved in the investigation. The IS statement wrongly claimed that two people were attacked with a knife. During the investigation, Hamburg police contacted about 11,500 Hamburg doctors, operating under the assumption that the perpetrator was injured himself during the attack. Hamburg Medical Council suspended the obligation to secrecy for the doctors in the city in this case, but no significant developments emerged from the effort. On 2 November, it was reported that a female eyewitness had probably seen the perpetrator on the day of the attack, loitering near the crime scene. A facial composite of him was created and published by the police. Police also reconstructed the last route of Viktor E. and his girlfriend from Steindamm, an inner city street, via Lohm√ºhlenstra√üe station, to Jungfernstieg, and then to Kennedybr√ºcke. The perpetrator may have followed his victims through that route. On 14 November, the mother of Viktor E. appealed to the public for assistance in the investigation; few useful clues had been provided to the police by then, although they posted handbills in several languages throughout the city. On 30 November, police stuck bills in about 170 residences used by refugees located all over the city. Police acknowledged that they had received 360 clues in total by 30 November, but that there were no significant developments in the case by then. Police said that they considered a terrorist background or motive unlikely. Suspect The suspect was described as a 23- to 25-year-old man \\"of southern appearance\\". He was approximately 1.8 to 1.9 m. tall, had dark hair, and a three-day stubble. He was wearing jeans and a brown pullover. Reactions On 23 October, friends and relatives of Viktor E. mourned at the location of the murder. Some AfD supporters demonstrated as well; one of them was arrested. 70 left-wing protesters held a counter-demonstration. Davis Lewin of the Henry Jackson Society stated that the \\"profile of the attack fits to the new strategy of IS\\".

Flowering occurs between April and May or July and November and the flowers are white or cream-coloured to yellow. The fruit is a woody, broadly conical capsule long and wide with prominent ridges and protruding valves that make them look like crowns. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus coronata was first formally described in 1933 by Charles Gardner and the description was published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia. Gardner had collected specimens near the Barren Range in 1914 and Henry Steedman had collected in 1931 from the same area. In 1936 Eucalyptus mitrata was also described by Gardner in the same journal but it is considered to be a synonym of E. coronata. The specific epithet (coronata) is from the Latin coronatus meaning \\"crowned\\" and refers to the ribbed operculum. Distribution and habitat Crowned mallee grows in heath on coastal hills between Middle Mount Barren and East Mount Barren in the Fitzgerald River National Park. It grows in skeletal sandy soils and is found on rocky quartzite hillsides. Conservation status This species is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant)\\" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia) It is known from three populations, all of which are located in Fitzgerald River National Park. The total number of plants is estimated to be 140 scattered over an area of . In the 1980s the total number of plants was estimated at 40 however the total number of plants recorded has fluctuated as a result of bushfires in 1989, 1990 and 2006. The main threats to the species are road maintenance activities and wildfire. Use in horticulture This eucalypt is available for cultivation in home gardens used as a small landscaping species, ornamental, hedging and for honey production. It is both frost and drought tolerant and will grow in a range of soil types and will cope in nutrient poor and acid soils.

It is loosely based on the Ettore Petrolini's character and comedy play with the same name. Plot Italy, 1920s. The suffered glimmers of war seem very far away, especially if and when you have the opportunity to have fun in places like the tabarin: it is here that Gastone, aka Gaston Le Beau, profession danseur mondain, accompanied by the inseparable tailcoat, performs dancing with extreme elegance and entertains the wealthy ladies who go there. Enclosed in the magnificent image of \\"bell'Adone\\", a woman-wasting dancer, elegant and sexy, Gastone is actually a frivolous and artless character, a well-known scammer at the police station who not only cares about being desired by the admirers but wants something else: success, that full glory and never achieved due to the outbreak of the Great War. Surrounded by equally fatuous and in some cases dishonest characters, including princes, loan sharks and beautiful women, Gastone cultivates his ambitions when a new student, Nannina, enrolls in his improvised dance school. It is not just a young and beautiful girl employed as a maid with nobles, but an excellent dancer, ambitious and determined. With her, Gaston deludes himself that he has finally found the new star of the club, the perfect dance partner. But, upon entering the scene, Gaston is suddenly taken to the police station for a complaint and Nannina, now known as Anna La Belle, performs alone and has a huge consensus. Thus began, a little by chance and a lot for talent and with the help of a famous impresario, the new solo career of Nannina, able in a short time to reach the highest fame performing in the most famous theaters and clubs in Europe. Missing the opportunity, Gaston proves unable to realize that the public's tastes have changed and that his glossy world is on the way to sunset. Now forgotten, disheartened and penniless, Gaston looks for the last chance by returning to perform in a second-rate club with Rosa, an old flame always devoted. But the last performance turns out to be a total fiasco and the bel danseur, reduced to poverty, has only a vain consolation left: to see Nannina again perhaps for one last time, thus leaving the scene convinced that he is, always and in any case, the most beautiful and desired.

Construction of a wind turbine in the Ellwanger Berge wind farm (2016) The name of the range comes from the town of Ellwangen. The hills are known nationally especially because of the eponymous motorway services on the A 7.  Geography = Location  The Ellwangen Hills belong to the Keuper Uplands and lie about 65 kilometres northeast of the city of Stuttgart and around 67 kilometres (both as the crow flies) east-southeast of the city of Heilbronn between the Haller Plain to the north, the Franconian Heights and the Virngrund to the east, the H√§rtsfeld to the south, the Frickenhofer H√∂he to the southwest and the Limpurg Hills to the west. They are situated south of Frankenhardt, west of Rosenberg and Ellwangen, northwest of H√ºttlingen, east of Adelmannsfelden, B√ºhlerzell and B√ºhlertann and southeast of Obersontheim and Vellberg.  Hills  The highest point of the Ellwangen Hills is the summit of the Sch√∂nberg at 569.2 m, which is 1.7 kilometres north-northeast of Neuler-Gaishardt. The hill has a rather uneven plateau to the south of the summit which is about 100 metres wide and around 700 metres long, over 560 m metres high. The Sch√∂nberg is entirely wooded which means there are no views from the top. The next highest point is the Hohenberg, 568.9 m, at the eastern foot of which is the village of Rosenberg-Hohenberg. The hilltop forms a steep, kuppe that rises roughly 50 metres above the surrounding area and has a plateau measuring about 300 metres from west to east and is 100 metres wide. Apart from its western hillside, the whole kuppe is treeless and offers views over much of the Ellwangen Hills, to the south as far as the Albtrauf. Several footpaths meet on the kuppe: from Burgberg to the north, B√ºhlerzell to the west, Orrotsee to the east and from Ellwangen to the southeast. There s a pilgrimage church, St. James, on the top and there is a Way of the Cross on the path climbing up from the village. For many years a branch of the Way of St. James also ran here, coming from Rothenburg ob der Tauber over the castle hill to the church and then on to Abtsgm√ºnd-W√∂llstein heading for Switzerland.

He is a member and founder of the alternative rock band Caf√© Tacvba. As singer and frontman of Caf√© Tacvba, the artist has characterized himself by his energetic attitude onstage and for presenting himself as different characters and aliases throughout his career. He started in music in the 1980s in the suburbs of Mexico City, forming Cafe Tacvba together with Joselo Rangel between 1988 and 1989, a group with which he gained international fame and made him worthy of the prizes Grammy and Grammy Latino. As a soloist he has released an album, Bienvenido al sue√±o and he formed the group Hoppo!, in addition to making duets and covers with diverse artists from Mexico and Latin America. He is an environmental activist and has shown his support for various political causes like the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and the Yo Soy 132 movement, among others.  Biography  He was born in Mexico City in 1967. His family then lived in Santa Mar√≠a la Ribera. He has three siblings. He spent the first five years of his life in Monterrey then returned to live in the Ciudad Sat√©lite area, in a metropolitan area of the Mexican capital. He grew up with the eclectic influence of the music his parents listened to, who liked to sing often. He had music as a hobby from secondary school, participating in school bands. Initially he wanted to play the electric guitar, but his parents insisted in buying him an acoustic, school teaching instrument which Albarr√°n studied, for which he broke it at the end of the course. His first guitar was a Sonatone, although afterwards he chose to be a vocalist. In high school he already settled in to diverse musical groups that played at private parties like in bars in Ciudad Sat√©lite in the mid-1980s. The first of them had names like Trial and Flanger, and the second was called Torah, a band playing their own compositions and covers of bands like The Police and artists like Charly Garc√≠a. Albarr√°n joined as a singer and he stood out for his talent in reaching high notes in songs by Led Zeppelin and Sting. Torah aappeared as a band based in bars in the commercial area of Ciudad Sat√©lite like Satelite Rocks, Spequio's and High Tower, in which bands with the record label Comrock played, including Ritmo Peligroso, Casino Shanghai and Mask, among others. He met Joselo Rangel at the Universidad Aut√≥noma Metropolitana, Azcapotzalco campus, shortly after the earthquake of 1985 when both were studying design (Joselo, industrial design; Rub√©n, graphic design), since Joselo had seen Rub√©n sing with Torah in the bar Rocks de Ciudad Sat√©lite and Albarr√°n recognized Joselo as part of Shine, a band in which Joselo played bass. Both used their free time at university to listen to bands on a boombox, with cassettes that they recorded and finding affinity in listening to bands that their classmates did not listen to as much. In 1987 they decided to form a band called Alicia ya no vive aqu√≠, in which both could share their similarities, with a strong influence of Love and Rockets, La Uni√≥n and The Cure, which was joined by Joselo's brother Quique. The band made no appearances. One year after they decided to split up the band and they formed a new band: Caf√© Tacvba.  Career = Soloist  Due to the arrival of his second child and as a tribute to his first, Rub√©n, together with his wife, decided to release Bienvenido al Sue√±o in 2006. For this project he called himself Sizu Yantra and his wife, Psikini. He was supported in his live appearances by a band of friends and relatives called Tepetokio. In 2010 Rub√©n Albarr√°n formed the group Hoppo!, a Latin American folk song covers band, with two Chilean musicians and with Alejandro Flores, better known as \\"the fifth Tacvbo\\". In subsequent appearances various musicians were added to the project. In 2011, the band's appearances only consisted of Rub√©n and the Chilean musicians Rodrigo \\"El Chino\\" Aros and Juan Pablo \\"El Mu√±eco\\" Villanueva. In addition to his records, Albarr√°n contributed in various beneficial associations. In 2016, he participated in the dubbing of the film Moana: a sea of adventures performing the song \\"I know the way\\" together with Opetaia Foa'i.

As frontman of Caf√© Tacvba he experimented in the creation of temporary characters, and always shows an energetic attitude in his performances.Gonz√°lez Rojas, Ver√≥nica Alicia sustentante. An√°lisis del videoclip del grupo Caf√© Tacvba : hacia una comprensi√≥n de sus recursos pl√°sticos.Tesis de maestr√≠a, UNAM, 2008. = Alter egos = Albarr√°n's constant change of names is due to the creation of characters or alter egos. The singer has declared that he does it to \\"breathe fresh air\\" and free himself from \\"being Rub√©n\\". In an interview in the Argentinian music magazine Los Inrockuptibles he mentions the origin of his constant change of names: \\"Sometimes I regret [being Rub√©n Albarr√°n] and other times I take it as a game... on one hand, I free myself from the weight of being Rub√©n, and on the other... it brings fresh air - besides, in short, it turns out theraputic for me.\\" In the era of the formation of Caf√© Tacvba, Albarr√°n already was experimenting with his attire. In the words of Joselo when he spoke of it for the first time, \\"Rub√©n was on that occasion with a white hat and a bag, and it was a strange and interesting thing, because no vocalist saw themselves like that, they all like rockers, but not him.\\" *Pinche Juan: The first time that Albarr√°n used an alter ego was in 1990 when Caf√© Tacvba started to play in underground places for rock in Spanish. At that time was a rise of the aesthetic of dark and punk bands, such as The Cure, so people went to bars like Tutti Frutti in Mexico City dressed in attire related to that subgenre. \\"They all had to come dressed in black, very dark. The joke was to make fun of that but at the same time we liked it\\", Albarr√°n said regarding the song \\"Pinche Juan\\", which is the Spanish form of \\"Johnny Rotten\\". Given the popularity of the track, people who saw him in the street started to shout \\"pinche Juan\\"; furthermore, Albarr√°n admired the band Ritmo Peligroso, whose members used pseudonyms, particularly the singer Piro Pendas, therefore he decided to adopt the pseudonym Juan for his appearance on the first album in 1992. In that era the band characteristically went out on stage in traditional Mexican clothing, an aesthetic they maintained until the release of their next album. *Cosme: Caf√© Tacvba wanted to create a concept album with Re. Part of the storyline is to do with the concept of duality in the beliefs of Mesoamerican people and ideas like atl-tlachinolli. Albarr√°n created the character of Cosme, dying his hair red, combing it to form small devil horns and wearing a red jacket and a checkered skirt. He took the name from the area of Rivera de San Cosme in Mexico City, where street vendors sold contraband since the 1970s. *An√≥nimo (Anonymous): When recording Avalancha de √âxitos it was Quique who suggested the new name \\"An√≥nimo\\", and so in 1996 An√≥nimo appeared as the main voice of Caf√© Tacvba. *Massiossare: Rub√©n once more changed to be Massiossare during the few engagements that were left of the band and one occasion which was a collaboration with other bands. *Nr√º y Amparo Tonto Medardo In Lak'ech: Facing the creation of the double album Rev√©s/YoSoy, being two different discs, he took two different names. On one side was Nr√º (which supposedly comes from an abbreviation of the phrase \\"N√∫cleo Radio √úno\\") and on the other side was Amparo Tonto Medardo In Lak' ech. \\"Amparo tonto\\" for a national political scandal of the time; \\"Medardo\\", name of the Vizconde de Terralba in the fantasy novel El vizconde demediado written by Italo Calvino; and \\"In Lak'ech\\" which in Maya means \\"I am another you\\" *Rita Cantalagua: When Caf√© Tacvuba took a year's break and split up, Rub√©n again changed his name, this time to Rita Cantalagua.. He explained its origin in an interview in 2001: \\"The Rita one I took from a German film called The Legends of Rita, and Cantalagua is a village I encountered on a trip around Mexico: one day I passed through here and I saw the sign \\"Hacienda Cantalagua\\". It sounded to me like canta el agua (the water sings).\\" *Gallo Gassss: With the release of Vale callampa in tribute to Los Tres, Rub√©n was known as \\"Gallo Gassss\\" and performed in a white suit and a hat with a cockerel's crest. *Ixaya Matatzin Tl√©yotl: Collectively given to him by his contects on MySpace *Elfego Buend√≠a: The recording of Cuatro Caminos started in which Rub√©n returned transformed into \\"Elfego Buend√≠a\\": Elfego in homage to one of his uncles who disappeared and Buend√≠a after the family from the novel Cien a√±os de soledad *Cone Cahuitl *Zopilote: a pseudonym used in 2012. In 2013, with the release of the album El objeto antes llamado disco he decided to stick with his real name, which has remained until the present with the release of Jei beibi  Discography  With Caf√© Tacvba = *1992 ‚Äì Caf√© Tacuba *1994 ‚Äì Re *1996 ‚Äì Avalancha De √âxitos *1999 ‚Äì Rev√©s/Yo Soy *2001 ‚Äì Teimpo Transcurrido *2002 ‚Äì Vale Callampa *2003 ‚Äì Cuatro Caminos *2005 ‚Äì Un Viaje *2005 ‚Äì MTV Unplugged (recorded in 1995) *2007 ‚Äì Sino *2012 ‚Äì El objeto antes llamado disco *2017 ‚Äì Jei Beibi *2019 ‚Äì Un Segundo MTV Unplugged = As soloist = *2006 ‚Äì Bienvenido al sue√±o  Activism  On top of his artistic work, Albarr√°n is an activist for different causes, primarily related to environmental protection and land protection. In 2012 he formed the collective Aho with other artists, a group in defense of sacred land of the indigenous Wixaricas, Wirikuta.. In this year he publicly showed his support for the YoSoy132 movement. In 2013 he joined protests against the structural reforms of the government of Enrique Pe√±a Nieto. In 2015 he joined Manu Chao and Roco Pachukote to show support in favour of the conservation of the Amazon. Albarr√°n is a supporter of the Ejercito Zapatista de Liberacion Nacional. In 2018 he showed his support for the independent candidate Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s Patricio Mart√≠nez, participating in public acts to back her.

The treating pediatrician misdiagnosed an inborn defect of the urea cycle (a very rare genetic condition). After the boy had been brought by his parents to the Paediatric Clinic in Maribor, the doctor, among other things, measured the level of ammonia in his blood and on the basis of a significantly increased level erroneously diagnosed Reye syndrome. Because of the misdiagnosis and a delay in appropriate treatment, the boy developed cerebral oedema and died eight days later. Diagnosis and treatment Before admission to the Maribor paediatric department, the boy was mainly healthy, as confirmed by parents and proved with his school report, except for a \\"cold\\". However, he worsened despite taking antibiotics. He was admitted to the emergency department of the Pediatric Clinic in Maribor at 18:00. In an interview published in April 2009, the doctor treating him said that after she had obtained the results of the ordered laboratory tests, among them the level of ammonia, she diagnosed Reye syndrome on the basis of Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, and began to treat him. In the morning, after a consultation, the doctors there called the colleagues at the University Clinical Centre in Ljubljana and ordered his transport there. The treating physician did not directly communicate with Ljubljana. The boy's father stated at a press conference in November 2008 that the doctors in Maribor had not discovered the elevation of ammonia. According to him, the next morning they received precise instructions for treatment by the doctors of the University Clinical Centre in Ljubljana, but did not implement them. They transported the boy, who had lost consciousness during the night, to Ljubljana with a \\"tourist transport\\". The boy's mother said that upon arrival at the Ljubljana hospital, the doctors there lowered his ammonia level \\"only with glucose and salt to a harmless level\\". As confirmed at the trial in September 2011 by the endocrinologist, who admitted the boy to the endocrinology department in Ljubljana, the boy was unconscious when he arrived. This surprised him, because the Maribor pediatricians told him that his condition had improved. The laboratory tests that he ordered showed a significantly increased level of ammonia. The intern who accompanied the boy during the transport to Ljubljana said that he had already been unconscious in Maribor. The transport took about an hour and a half. The emergency medical service team said that the transport was not urgent and that the transporting van was not equipped for urgent situations. This was also evident from the documentation. According to the board for professional and ethical issues at the Medical Chamber of Slovenia, the treatment was appropriate until the receipt of the laboratory results showing the increase of the level of ammonia. Due to the misdiagnosis, additional necessary treatment was begun only in the morning. They noted that the boy should have been transferred to Ljubljana immediately upon the receipt of the laboratory results. According to them, the doctor who ordered the transport to Ljubljana refrained from administering glucose due to an already increased level of blood glucose. They also noted that it was not possible to say whether the boy would have survived with appropriate treatment. Internal audit and court trial An internal audit was held and the parents sued the doctor. In October 2011, the competent judge found her guilty of negligent treatment. She received a suspended sentence of ten months in prison with a two-year probation. The court established that the correct way of acting would have been to immediately transfer the boy to the endocrinology department of the University Medical Centre in Ljubljana. The Medical Chamber of Slovenia stripped the doctor of her license for four months. Later, the prosecutor also filed a criminal charge against the president of the internal audit commission for perjury. He claimed that the commission's president had witnessed differently in the criminal investigation than at the trial and that the diagnosis of Reye syndrome did not occur either in the patient's documentation or in the records of the internal audit. The commission's president witnessed at the trial against the doctor that the doctor had mentioned Reye's syndrome to the commission. At the trial, the doctor defended herself with the claim that she did not prescribe the correct therapy because she diagnosed this syndrome. In February 2015, the commission's president was, on the basis of numerous witnesses who all confirmed the president's words, found not guilty. After the prosecutor's appeal, this was reconfirmed by the competent high court in March 2016.

It was first published in Dutch in 2013 through Luitingh-Sijthoff and was published in English in 2016 through Tor Books, marking the first time one of Olde Heuvelt's novels have been published in English. The English version was translated by Nancy Forest-Flier and the decision was made to localize the work by shifting the story's setting from the Netherlands to New York. While re-writing the work to change the setting from Beek, Berg en Dal to New York, Olde Heuvelt also re-wrote and changed the book's ending from the original Dutch version. Film and television rights for HEX have been purchased by Warner Brothers.  Synopsis  The novel is set in the town of Black Spring, New York (Beek in the original Dutch version), where its inhabitants are routinely terrorized by the ghost of the Black Rock Witch. The witch was formerly a woman by the name of Katherine van Wyler, who was put to death in 1664 and had her eyes and mouth sewn shut after death. She will randomly appear in places throughout Black Spring and the townpeople track her progress via the HEX mobile app, which they use to avoid her as much as possible. The town has several core rules and safeguards in place to ensure that a delicate balance is kept. Two of the most major rules is that no outsiders can ever learn about the Black Rock Witch's existence and her stitches must never be removed. Leaving the town is not an option, as being away for longer than a few days causes townspeople to become suicidal. The townspeople try to make do as best as possible and discourage new people from coming into town, but this is not always successful. Unhappy with this setup, a group of the town's teenagers secretly make plans to broadcast the witch's existence across the world, a move that puts them at risk of severe punishment from the town's council as videotaping the witch is forbidden. Initially the teens are cocky in their recordings, but over time tensions within their group begin to tear them apart and set in motion a terrible set of events that threaten to exterminate the entire town.  Reception  Locus Online praised the English translation and felt that Olde Heuvelt's \\"adoption of the North American venue is cannily done, with no false steps a writer working from Europe might be expected to make.\\" Jonathan Hatfull of SciFiNow compared Olde Heuvelt's work to that of Stephen King, especially Pet Sematary and Needful Things. Kirkus Reviews said that \\"The story is not merely unsettling, it is horrifying, and there is no redemption or image of hope in which one can find solace. But one cannot deny that it is well-done\\".

The passenger problem arises when such a device or system is intended to function differently when used by a driver versus a passenger, but is unable to autonomously determine the role of its user. The problem is a factor for distracted driving prevention systems, GPS navigation software, and usage- based insurance systems.  History  The term \\"passenger problem\\" was first used by technology writer David Pogue in 2010 as part of a series on distracted driving in The New York Times. Reviewing the first generation of distracted driving prevention technologies, Pogue noted their different approaches to the problem: ‚ÄúHow can I bypass the block if I‚Äôm not the one driving?‚Äù The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) acknowledged the passenger problem with the publication of its first set of Distracted Driving Safety Guidelines in 2012. The guidelines applied only to integrated vehicle electronics, recommending the lock-out of dangerous tasks ‚ÄúFor any in-vehicle device that is within sight and reach of the driver (even if it is intended for use solely by passengers)‚Ä¶whenever the vehicle‚Äôs engine is on and its transmission is not in ‚ÄòPark‚Äô.‚Äù The guidelines intentionally excluded portable devices such as smartphones because of the ‚Äúspecial challenges‚Äù posed by the fact that their position in the vehicle is not fixed. In 2014, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) convened a public meeting on the subject of distracted driving prevention technologies, expressing its interest ‚Äúin technology to determine the location of portable and aftermarket devices within the vehicle, thereby automatically determining whether the device is operated by the driver versus passengers while driving‚Äù for safety purposes.

He has been Minister of Justice and First Notary of the Kingdom since September 2014, and was additionally interim Minister of Public Works between 19 July 2016 and 4 November 2016. Before this, he served as the 4th Secretary of State for Justice between 2002 and 2004 and as the 8th Secretary of State for Infrastructure, Transport and Housing from 2011 to 2014. On 16 May 2017, the Congress of Deputies passed a motion of censure against Catal√° as minister of justice. This was as a result of the maneuvers that have taken place within the fiscal ministry aimed at obstructing certain judicial cases against corruption and of the minister's own actions relating to these cases. He is the first minister of democracy rejected by the full Congress. Together with the Minister, Jos√© Manuel Maza, the Attorney General and Manuel Moix, the Anti-corruption Prosecutor, were rejected.  Biography  Graduated in Law from the Complutense University of Madrid, in 1985 he entered the Higher Body of Civil State Administrators by competitive examination. During his administrative career, he held the post of Deputy Director General of Organisation and Human Resources Policy in the Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs (1988-1992). In 1992, he joined AENA, where he was Director of Human Resources Planning and Development, Director of Labour Relations and Director of Administration and Air Navigation Services. He also served until 2011 as general secretary of Codere, a company in the gaming sector.  Political Career  After the People's Party's electoral victory in 1996, the Council of Ministers appointed him Director General of the Civil Service in the Ministry of Public Administration, then headed by Mariano Rajoy. Catal√° in October 2001 In January 1999, he was appointed Director General of Personnel and Services at the Ministry of Education and Culture, and between May 2000 and July 2002 he was Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Finance. Between 2002 and 2004 he was Secretary of State for Justice in the Department headed by Jos√© Mar√≠a Michavila. After the 2004 general elections, he was in charge of the management of the Ram√≥n y Cajal Hospital in Madrid. In addition, since 2005 he has been director of the master's degree in Public Administration at Esade and a member of the UNED Social Council. On 23 December 2011 the Council of Ministers appointed him Secretary of State for Planning and Infrastructure of the Ministry of Public Works, at the proposal of its head, Ana Pastor Juli√°n. Following Alberto Ruiz-Gallard√≥n's resignation, on 23 September 2014 he was appointed as successor to the Minister of Justice. His appointment was published on 29 September 2014,the day he took office. On 19 July 2016, he took over the ordinary business of the Ministry of Public Works, whose incumbent until now, Ana Pastor Juli√°n, ceased to hold office after his election as president of the Congress of Deputies. On 3 November 2016, his continuity as Minister of Justice was confirmed during the second government of Mariano Rajoy, and he was renewed as Minister on 4 November 2016. On 16 May 2017, he was rejected as Minister of Justice by the Congress of Deputies as a result of the manoeuvres that have taken place within the Public Prosecutor's Office aimed at obstructing certain judicial cases against corruption and the minister's own actions relating to these cases. This makes him the first Minister of Democracy to be rejected by the full Congress. Along with the minister himself, the attorney general Jos√© Manuel Maza and the chief anti-corruption prosecutor Manuel Moix were also censured.

Oattara signed a two-way contract with the Brooklyn Nets of the NBA on July 21, 2017, becoming the first foreign born player to sign a two-way deal with an NBA team. Under the terms of the deal, he would have planned to split time between the Brooklyn Nets and their G League affiliate, the Long Island Nets, with a majority of his time being spent with the Long Island affiliate team. However, due to injury problems throughout the year, he would never get a chance to play with the Brooklyn Nets squad, having only played in one G League game with the Long Island Nets during that time.

History  The Sophia Polder originated as an area of marshes in the , blocked off by the (1788) as part of works to improve navigability of the Western Scheldt. Naturally occurring silting was here accelerated by the Bakkerdam's construction. Around 1800, the land was gifted to Dominique Vandamme as a reward for his military exploits on behalf of the empire. In 1807, a further damming exercise took place under orders from General Vandamme (which also gave rise to the . The resulting polder has grown to an area of approximately . It was named the Sophia Polder, after General Vandamme's wife. The general constructed a wooden pavilion on the polder to be used as a summer residence. In 1860 this was enlarged, becoming a farmstead. It continues to be known as \\"the pavilion\\" (\\"het Paviljoen\\" or \\"het Paviljoen Van Damme\\").  Contemporary development  Since the time of General Vandamme the landscape of the Sophia Polder has been further affected by drainage work and sand extraction. The hamlet of Bakkerdam has developed at the eastern end of the polder. From here, the drainage canal (\\"uitwateringskanaal\\") flows in a westerly direction along the northerly edge of the polder, following the line of what was formerly the . To the south of the drainage canal, sand extraction has created a marshy creek which forms a natural magnet for water birds. Its attraction to water birds has been enhanced by further land management measures undertaken since the polder was designated a wild life reserve in 2006. The entire area is regulated by a so-called \\"semi-natural water level management\\" system (\\"semi-natuurlijk peilbeheer\\"). For the purposes of these measures the polder was divided into three zones. Sophiapolder West (Phase 1) was completed in 2006 and Sophiapolder-Middle (Phase 2) was completed in 2008. There is no agreed starting (or completion) date for Sophiapolder East (Phase 3). The water level in middle section is deeper than that in the western section: the middle section includes a large flat island which is a prime nesting location for water birds. For the eastern section, less sand extraction is anticipated which will make the zone less suitable for nesting seabirds, but more effective as a reserve for rare marsh plant species.

Releases=10.x series The initial stable release from the openSUSE Project was SUSE Linux 10.0, released on October 6, 2005. This was released as a freely downloadable ISO image and as a boxed retail package, with certain bundled software only included in the retail package. On May 11, 2006, the openSUSE Project released SUSE Linux 10.1, with the mailing list announcement identifying Xgl, NetworkManager, AppArmor and Xen as prominent features. For their third release, the openSUSE Project renamed their distribution, releasing openSUSE 10.2 on December 7, 2006. Several areas that developers focused their efforts on were reworking the menus used to launch programs in KDE and GNOME, moving to ext3 as the default file system, providing support for internal readers of Secure Digital cards commonly used in digital cameras, improving power management framework (more computers can enter suspended states instead of shutting down and starting up) and the package management system. This release also featured version 2.0 of Mozilla Firefox. The fourth release, openSUSE 10.3, was made available as a stable version on October 4, 2007. An overhaul of the software package management system (including support for 1-Click-Install), legal MP3 support from Fluendo and improved boot-time are some of the areas focused on for this release. 11.x series openSUSE 11.0 was released on June 19, 2008. It includes the latest version of GNOME and two versions of KDE (the older, stable 3.5.9 and the newer 4.0.4). It comes in three freely downloadable versions: a complete installation DVD (including GNOME, KDE3, and KDE4), and two Live CDs (GNOME, and KDE4 respectively). A KDE3 Live CD was not produced due to limited resources. Package management and installation were made significantly faster with ZYpp. openSUSE 11.1 was released on December 18, 2008. Updated software includes GNOME 2.24.1, Plasma 4.1.3 + K Desktop Environment 3.5.10, OpenOffice.org 3.0, VirtualBox 2.0.6, Compiz 0.7.8, Zypper 1.0.1, continued improvement in the software update stack, X.Org 7.4, Xserver 1.5.2, and Linux kernel 2.6.27.7. openSUSE 11.1 was the first Evergreen supported release. openSUSE 11.2 was released on November 12, 2009. It includes Plasma 4.3, GNOME 2.28, Mozilla Firefox 3.5, OpenOffice.org 3.1, improved social network support, updated filesystems such as Ext4 as the new default and support for Btrfs, installer support for whole-disk encryption, significant improvements to YaST and zypper, and all ISO images are hybrid and now support both USB and CD-ROM boot. openSUSE 11.3 was released on July 15, 2010. It includes Plasma 4.4.4, GNOME 2.30.1, Mozilla Firefox 3.6.6, OpenOffice.org 3.2.1, SpiderOak support, support for the Btrfs filesystem and support for LXDE. It also updates the Linux kernel to version 2.6.34. openSUSE 11.4 was finished on March 3, 2011 and released on March 10, 2011. It includes Plasma 4.6.0, GNOME 2.32.1, Mozilla Firefox 4.0 beta 12, and switched from OpenOffice.org to LibreOffice 3.3.1. It updates the Linux kernel to version 2.6.37. 12.x series openSUSE 12.1 was released on November 16, 2011. This includes Plasma 4.7 and GNOME 3.2 and Firefox 7.0.1. The Linux kernel was updated to 3.1.0 It also introduced an advanced disk snapshot tool, called Snapper, for managing Btrfs snapshots. openSUSE 12.1 was also the first release of openSUSE to use systemd by default rather than the traditional System V init. Users can still select to boot to System V init at startup time. openSUSE 12.2 was to be released on July 11, 2012, but was postponed due to persistent stability issues. The final release candidate was eventually announced on August 2, 2012 and the final release date was September 5, 2012. 12.2 includes the desktop environments Plasma 4.8, GNOME 3.4, Firefox 14.0.1, and Xfce 4.10 and now uses Plymouth and GRUB 2 by default. openSUSE 12.3 was released on schedule on March 13, 2013. This includes Plasma 4.10, GNOME 3.6, Firefox 19.0, LibreOffice 3.6, and the removal of SuSEconfig. Also, the Live CD images were replaced with Live USB images, and an Xfce rescue image. 13.x series openSUSE 13.1 was released on November 19, 2013, and includes updates to Plasma 4.11, GNOME 3.10, Firefox 25.0, and LibreOffice 4.1. Some other changes include a YaST port to Ruby, the LightDM KDE greeter, and experimental Wayland support in the GNOME Shell and KDE Plasma Desktop. openSUSE 13.1 is an Evergreen supported release, meaning it will receive community patches for 18 months after SUSE support ends. openSUSE 13.2 was released on November 4, 2014, and includes updates to Plasma 4.11, KDE Applications 4.14, GNOME 3.14.1, Firefox 33.0 and LibreOffice 4.3.2.2. Leap 42.x series The openSUSE team decided that the next version would be based on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES). They named it \\"Leap 42\\" (42 being the answer to life, the universe and everything); Still version 15 comes thereafter. Leap 42.2 features KDE Plasma 5.8 LTS as its default desktop environment.https://news.opensuse.org/2016/09/22/new-leap- beta-adds-plasma-5-8-beta/ Leap 15.x series openSUSE Leap 15 is based on SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE). The name \\"Leap 15\\" is meant to match the SUSE Linux Enterprise version it is based on. Leap 15 (just like SUSE Linux Enterprise 15) uses Linux kernel 4.12 LTS, and the default desktop is KDE Plasma 5.12 LTS. It also allows users to switch to its enterprise variant - SUSE Linux Enterprise 15. Version history The openSUSE project aims to release a new version every eight months. Since version 11.2, critical updates have been provided for two releases plus two months, which results in a support lifetime of 18 months. Starting with version 12.1, to add predictability and to prevent people from thinking the .0 releases are more major, the openSUSE version scheme has changed. All November releases have a .1, all July releases have a .2, and all March releases have a .3. Every two years, when another .1 version is released, the major version number is bumped up. Starting with version Leap 42.1 (after version 13.2), each major release is expected to be supported for at least 36 months, until the next major version is available (e.g. 15.0), aligned with SUSE Linux Enterprise Releases. Each minor release (e.g. 42.1, 42.2, etc.) is expected to be released annually, aligned with SUSE Linux Enterprise Service Packs, and users are expected to upgrade to the latest minor release within 6 months of its availability, leading to a similar support lifecycle of 18 months as earlier. According to Richard Brown on behalf of the openSUSE Board and Leap Release Management, the next version of openSUSE Leap after 42.3 will be openSUSE Leap 15. Evergreen is a community effort to prolong maintenance of selected openSUSE versions after they reach official end-of-life. It currently seems to be inactive.

The museum serves both as a conservator of automotive history and as a tool for students in the industrial design department at the Academy of Art University, particularly those in the Automotive Restoration program. Forbes has estimated the value of the museum's collection to be $70 million. The museum is accessible for the public by appointment at scheduled times.  History  A former President of the Academy of Art University, Richard A. Stephens, started the museum and is the proprietor of over half of the cars. The Stephens family‚Äîincluding Richard's daughter and current University President Elisa Stephens‚Äîbegan to seriously collect antique cars in the 1990s. The first car purchased for the collection was a 1929 Packard due to its being built the same year that the University was founded by Richard S. Stephens. In 1999, AAU purchased the main showroom it has today at 1849 Washington Street and then bought additional showroom space in 2012. In 2016, the museum was described by Hemmings Motor News‚Äô Dan Stoner as being ‚Äúone of the largest collections of antique cars on the West Coast.‚Äù Currently, the museum has seven full-time workers who maintain and preserve the vehicles.  Exhibits and collections  The Tucker 48 is one of the museum's most prized vehicles. The Tucker 48 that the museum has in its display is production car #1003. The car was purchased at auction for $2,035,000 from the previous owner, George Lucas, who executive produced the 1988 film Tucker: The Man and His Dream. The car has also been exhibited at the San Francisco International Auto Show, among other car shows. The museum also exhibits the 1933 Pierce-Arrow Silver Arrow, which can reach a speed of 115 mph and was previously owned and restored by William F. Harrah. Only five of these cars were built in total and today only two others remain. In 2009, the museum exhibited around 30 cars from the 1930s at the 52nd Annual International Auto Show. In 2013, 34 vehicles were featured at the International Auto Show presented by AutoTrader.com. The vehicles were chosen by the University's Industrial Design Department Director Tom Matano. Kevin Diamond, director of the show said: \\"We are proud to be able to exhibit vehicles from the museum that represent the elegance, style, craftsmanship, technology and innovative spirit of automotive designers past and present.‚Äù In 2016, over 30 cars from the museum's collection are expected to be displayed at the 59th annual International Auto Show at San Francisco's Moscone Center. In 2018, Academy of Art University auctioned off 50 cars at Mecum Las Vegas, which was expected to help the organization build a museum to house their collection, as well as trim it down by selling the duplicates and ones that already have other versions of the same model. Early in 2018, Robert Fisher was announced as the new chief executive officer of Academy of Art University Automobile Museum.

It saw action during The Blitz, landed in Normandy on D-Day and served throughout the subsequent campaign in North West Europe, operating as medium artillery in the Battle of the Scheldt, Unusually, its AA guns were successfully used to destroy enemy submarines in the closing stages of the war. Origin 113th Heavy AA Regiment was raised as part of the rapid expansion of Anti-Aircraft Command in late 1940. Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) was formed on 25 November 1940 at No 3 AA Practice Camp at T≈∑ Croes on Anglesey to take command of 359, 362 and 366 HAA Batteries, which had been raised on 21 September 1940. On 10 December, RHQ moved to Nottingham, where it came under the operational control of 50th AA Brigade in 2nd AA Division. As the batteries arrived they occupied gun sites around Nottingham. Lieutenant-Colonel E.A. Goodwin was appointed commanding officer (CO) on 17 December. The newly formed 391 HAA Bty joined the regiment from No 2 AA Practice Camp at Burrow Head and took over sites round Derby in February. This battery had been formed at 211th HAA Training Rgt at Oswestry on 14 November 1940 based on a cadre supplied by 78th (1st East Anglian) HAA Regiment.113 HAA Rgt War Diary 1940-41, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 166/2403.Frederick, pp. 757-8, 781.Farndale, Annex M.113 HAA Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45.

When a new 66th AA Bde was formed in 2nd AA Division at Derby, 113th HAA Rgt transferred to it on 4 March 1941.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 212/79. The North and East Midlands had escaped the worst of the bombing during the early part of The Blitz, but Nottingham and Derby were heavily attacked on the night of 8/9 May 1941 (the Nottingham Blitz).Nottingham Post, 19 July 2012. The regiment sent a cadre of experienced officers and men to 206th Training Regiment at Arborfield for a new 439 Bty; this was formed on 12 June 1941 and joined the regiment on 4 September 1941, replacing 359 Bty, which transferred to 60th (City of London) HAA Rgt,Frederick, pp. 758‚Äì61.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, TNA file WO 212/80. and later became an independent battery in the Falkland Islands garrison.Joslen, p. 551. Other cadres from the regiment formed:Frederick, pp. 758‚Äì61. On 7 August the regiment sent another cadre of experienced officers to 206th HAA Training Rgt to form a new 469 (Mixed) HAA Bty composed largely of women members of the Auxiliary Territorial Service. This joined 132nd (Mixed) HAA Rgt. The regiment supplied further cadres as follows: * 512 HAA Bty formed on 19 January 1942 at 206th HAA Training Rgt, Arborfield, which joined 149th HAA Rgt * 545 HAA Bty formed on 12 March 1942 at 207th HAA Training Rgt, Oswestry, but this battery was cancelled * 557th HAA Bty formed on 3 June 1942 at 205th HAA Training Rgt at Arborfield, which joined 168th HAA Rgt * 559th HAA Bty formed on 30 April 1942 at 205th HAA Training Rgt at Arborfield, but this battery was also cancelled Mid-war 3.7-inch HAA gun preserved at Fort Paull (Photo: Andy Beecroft). The Derby‚ÄìNottingham Gun Defence Area (GDA) saw a renewal of occasional night attacks in the autumn of 1941, with all the regiment's sites engaged on 22 October. In February 1942, the regiment transferred to the Hull GDA under 39th AA Bde in 10th AA Division. Here the responsibility was to protect industry along the Humber Estuary. Hull city centre and its docks had been badly bombed in 1941 (the Hull Blitz) and continued to be regularly attacked. RHQ was established at Wawne Hall, near Hull, later moving to Paull (gun site H7) and the batteries took over gun sites along the Humber, with 362 Bty at Scunthorpe. The regiment's guns were in action before the end of the month, and regularly engaged hostile aircraft at night. On the night of 20 May, one of its gun sites was bombed, suffering 11 casualties, two of them fatal.113 HAA Rgt War Diary 1942, TNA file WO 166/7481.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81. On 18 May, Major F.R. Gilbert, TD (a pre-war Territorial Army officer with 53rd (City of London) HAA Rgt), was promoted from 439 Bty to command the regiment as Lt-Col, after which 439 Bty left the regiment and became an independent unit under War Office control. It briefly rejoined the regiment from June to October, then reverted to independent status.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82. In May the regiment was due to move to Southern England, but in fact it remained in Hull until August, though its batteries began to move around regularly, manning sites at York, Leeds and Yeadon, West Yorkshire. In August, the regiment moved to the Scottish Highlands under 51st AA Bde in 6th AA Group. RHQ was established at Poolewe, and there were gun sites at Kyle of Lochalsh, Oban, Fort William and Balmacara. 362 Battery was detached to the London Inner Artillery Zone in October, manning sites at Walthamstow and Barnes, and then at Bedfont and Yeading in Middlesex, where it saw action against night intruders. Mobile training On 22 November 1942, 113th HAA Rgt was ordered to begin the process of mobilisation to become part of the field force. By the end of the year the batteries were dispersed around the country: 362 Bty to Pembroke, and then to No 2 HAA Practice Camp, Burrow Head; 366 Bty to the Clyde GDA, and 391 Bty with RHQ at Aberdeen. In late January 1943 the regiment assembled at Haltwhistle for a month's battle training, and then went to 11 AA Bde Tactical School at Leigh-on-Sea for mobile training. The batteries then dispersed again to assist 3rd AA Group: 362 Bty to Bristol, 366 Bty to Newport, Wales and Gloucester, and 391 Bty to Predannack.113 HAA Rgt War Diary 1943, TNA file WO 166/11596. On 1 May, 113th HAA Rgt was withdrawn from AA Command and came under Home Forces, ordered to mobilise for overseas service. It concentrated at Oulton Park Camp, Tarporley, in Cheshire.

Mobile HAA regiments had an establishment of three batteries each of two troops, with a total of 24 towed 3.7-inch guns. They also had their own Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) workshops, and 113 HAA Workshop was formed at New Holland, Lincolnshire, in April 1943. It was formally mobilised for overseas service the following month and joined the regiment at Tarporley in July.113 HAA Wksp War Diary 1943, TNA file WO 166/13583. Similarly, 113 HAA Rgt Signal Section, Royal Corps of Signals, joined during the summer. By January 1944, 76th AA Bde had been joined by the lorries of 323 Company Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) to provide mobility, and 1652 HAA Rgt Platoon was assigned to 113th HAA Rgt.76 AA Bde War Diary, 1944, TNA file WO 171/1084. Intensive training continued: in June 1943 the regiment attended the Home Forces Sea Target Practice Camp at Ramsgate, next went to Redesdale Practice Camp for ground shooting on the Otterburn Ranges, and then to 1st AA Practice Camp at Aberporth, while the REME Workshop underwent battle training. In the autumn the regiment took part in beach landing exercises at Poole. At the beginning of 1944 the regiment moved its base to Southend-on-Sea, while parties again visited Otterburn and Clacton-on- Sea for firing practice, and took part in beach exercises at Inverary and Hayling Island.113 HAA Rgt War Diary 1944, TNA file WO 171/1158. D-Day In the second half of May 1944 the regiment concentrated at Ipswich and then on 1 June the reconnaissance groups embarked on Landing Craft, Tank (LCTs) at Southampton while the main body were loaded onto Landing Ships, Tank (LSTs) at Felixstowe. 76th AA Brigade was to provide the AA support for 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, landing on Gold Beach. 113th HAA Regiment was assigned to the AA Assault Group scheduled to land on D-Day itself, on Jig and King sectors. Regimental HQ of 113rd HAA Rgt was to control the AA Assault Group, with Lt-Col Gilbert acting as AA Defence Commander (AADC) under 104 Beach Sub Area. Assault units landed with minimum scales of equipment, to be brought up to strength by parties landing later. Light AA (LAA) defence was emphasised at the start of the operation, since low-level attack by Luftwaffe aircraft was considered the most likely threat, so the HAA guns would only begin to land on the second tide:Routledge, pp. 305‚Äì12.76 AA Bde Operation Order No 1, 10 May 1944, TNA file WO 171/1084.80 AA Bde Operation Order No 1, 20 May 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085.Joslen, p. 581.

RHQ of 113rd HAA Rgt landed at Le Hamel at 15.00 on the second tide and set up the tactical HQ, but none of its own guns appeared. At midnight, Gilbert (as AADC) reported that on King Beach he had eight guns of 394/120 LAA Bty (one Bofors having been lost when its LCT hit a mine) and six triple 20mm mountings of 320/93 LAA Bty, while on Jig Beach there were nine 40mm and two triple 20 mm. Landings continued the next day (D+1) and by nightfall 113th HAA Rgt had 20 guns ashore (the other four having been damaged in landing), which engaged an air raid that night, two aircraft being destroyed. Once the AA defences of Gold Beach were in place, 76th AA Bde's main task became the protection of the artificial Mulberry harbour being assembled nearby at Arromanches-les-Bains. RHQ of 113th HAA was positioned at Meuvaines.Routledge, Table XLIX, p. 319. Normandy As the campaign progressed 113th HAA Rgt had almost nightly engagements against small formations of enemy aircraft. In addition, one battery was made available to XXX Corps' medium artillery to fire on ground targets. On 10 June the regiment collected two captured German 88mm flak guns and proposed to use them in the anti-tank role if required. 362 and 391 Batteries each collected another of these guns on 12 June; 76th AA Bde reported that three of these four guns had anti-tank sights. After 26 June the night air attacks on the bridgehead tailed off as the Luftwaffe concentrated on laying mines in the anchorage. Night raids on land targets resumed following Operation Charnwood (8‚Äì9 July); some of these raids were by low-flying single-engined aircraft, which the regiment engaged with Light machine guns. The last attack engaged by the regiment was on 20/21 August. Breakout An AEC Matador tows a 3.7-inch HAA gun through the ruins of Caen, August 1944 21st Army Group broke out from the Normandy beachhead at the end of August and began to pursue the defeated German troops across Northern France. AA defence of the beachhead became less important and 76th AA Bde was released from its commitments there in order to follow the advance. On 1 September 113th HAA Rgt was ordered to redeploy to Amiens and Dieppe for AA defence. The batteries crossed the Bailey bridge at Elbeuf the following day and the regiment was in position at Bovelles on 3 September, with 362 Bty at Dieppe.Routledge, p. 317; Table L, p. 327. By 11 September the armies were advancing so rapidly that 76th AA Bde gave up Dieppe and concentrated at Amiens under orders to prepare for the AA defence of the vital port of Antwerp once that was in Allied hands. In the interim the brigade took over coast defence duties at Boulogne, with 113th HAA Rgt moving there on 23 September. Next day, 362/113th HAA Bty came under fire from German 88 mm guns at Cap Gris Nez, and for two days the battery replied until the target was observed to be damaged.Routledge, p. 323. The Scheldt The planned move to Antwerp finally occurred in mid-October. 113th HAA Rgt handed its sites over to 103rd HAA Rgt and moved into Belgium. 76th AA Brigade's intended deployment area was still in enemy hands, so 113th HAA Rgt operated in the ground role supporting II Canadian Corps in clearing the south side of the Scheldt Estuary (the Battle of the Scheldt). The regiment's guns were in position by 18 October and began engaging targets the same day. Over succeeding weeks the targets requested by the Canadians varied from church towers and farm buildings to single pillboxes and emplacements, sometimes in support of patrols by 18th (Manitoba) Armoured Car Rgt, or 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division's Reconnaissance Rgt. 113th HAA Regiment also carried out nighttime harassing fire on designated areas. Lieutenant-Colonel Gilbert was later made a Chevalier of the Belgian Order of Leopold II with palm, and awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre with palm, for his services in this campaign.Gilbert's citation at TNA file WO 373/111/616. On the night of 30 October it was reported that the Germans were withdrawing from the south side of the Scheldt by sea, and 362 Bty was ordered to fire airburst high explosive shells over the evacuations. By 5 November the regiment had crossed to South Beveland in the Netherlands and deployed in the ground role around Goes where it also formed part of the 'Scheldt North' AA deployment under 76th AA Bde.Routledge, p. 335.113 HAA Rgt war diary summary at Royal Artillery Netherlands. 362 and 366 Batteries were ordered to occupy positions on Walcheren, at Vlissingen and Middelburg, but reconnaissance parties reported that all the routes were flooded (while western Walcheren was still in enemy hands). Finally, on 16 November, the batteries were ordered to return to Breskens on the south bank and be ferried across to Walcheren by the only LCT available. It took until 24 November before D Troop's four guns and AA radar were in position, and two days later for B Troop's guns to be ready for coastal defence at Flushing. 13 Fire Control Post at Flushing, which later came under the regiment's command, became operational on 29 November.113 HAA Rgt War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/4921.Routledge, p. 335; Map 30. The only enemy aircraft seen in this period were on reconnaissance missions, usually very high, and some Messerschmitt Me 262 jet aircraft were unsuccessfully engaged, but on 8 December the regiment scored its first 'kill' since arriving in the area, when A Trp of 362 Bty destroyed a Junkers Ju 188 picked up on radar and then illuminated by searchlight. When the German Army launched its Ardennes offensive (the Battle of the Bulge) aimed at breaking through to Antwerp, 76th AA Bde was ordered to take precautions against possible attacks by German airborne troops, as well as dealing with increased air activity at night. On 1 January 1945, the Luftwaffe launched Operation Bodenplatte: daylight attacks against Allied airfields in support of the Ardennes offensive. Between 09.20 and 09.54 some 50‚Äì60 enemy aircraft, mainly Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190, came over 76th AA Bde's area. Although the brigade's LAA guns were highly successful, HAA guns were at a disadvantage and 113th Rgt fired few rounds, although some of its gunsites engaged the fighters with small arms fire, and one site was attacked with cannon fire.76 AA Bde War Diary, January‚ÄìJuly 1945, TNA file WO 171/4889.Routledge, pp. 346‚Äì7. Biber midget submarine preserved at Technik Museum Speyer. There was a smaller attack by groups of fighters on 5 January, and a moonlight attack on 24 January, but after that enemy air activity was sparse. However, German Biber midget submarines constituted a new threat to Allied shipping in the Scheldt Estuary. On 22 February, gun position H71 (B Troop at Flushing) engaged one of these submarines with 22 rounds and destroyed it, just 20 minutes before a large convoy passed on its way to Antwerp. Another periscope was reported to H71 and 13 FCP on 12 March; it was spotted by the No 1 of No 1 gun, who destroyed it with his second shot.Routledge, p. 348. Disbandment REME workshops in the AA units were reorganised at the beginning of February 1945; 113th HAA Rgt's workshop was disbanded to form the basis of a new workshop unit for 103rd AA Bde, while a new smaller REME detachment (No 918) was posted to the regiment. At the end of February, the regiment began receiving new equipment: No 3 Mk V gun-laying radar (the SCR-584 radar), No 10 Predictors (the all-electric Bell Labs AAA Computer), and even four M15 Halftrack self-propelled AA guns.Routledge, p. 334. However, as the war in Europe drew to its close and the remnant of the Luftwaffe was powerless, the AA commitments could be reduced and troops redeployed. The regiment was relieved from its positions on the Scheldt by 146th HAA Rgt and returned to Belgium, then on 18 April it was informed that it was to be disbanded. On 24‚Äì25 April it handed in its guns, equipment and vehicles. Disbandment began on 31 May and the process was completed on 16 June 1945.Routledge, p. 348; Table LVII, p. 366. In the postwar reorganisation of the Royal Artillery, 175th HAA Rgt was redesignated 113 HAA Rgt on 1 April 1947, but on 1 May the regiment was disbanded, retroactive to 1 April 1947.113 HAA Rgt at British Army 1945 on.

Original caption in his 1912 book: Klemantans making fire in the jungle by sawing one piece of bamboo across another. The Klemantan people were a purported ethnic group indigenous to the island of Borneo. The term was established in Western literature by British scientist and colonial administrator Charles Hose in the early 20th century, but has since been rejected as an invented term of convenience that does not properly represent the people it claims to describe. Since then, the term has fallen largely out of use. Origin Hose had decades-long experience as a colonial administrator of Sarawak, at that time an independent kingdom ruled by the British Brooke dynasty on the northwestern coast of Borneo. When describing the native people of Sarawak, Hose categorized them into six different \\"principal groups\\": Ibans, Kayans, Kenyahs, Muruts, Punans, and the \\"Klemantans\\". While the other five groupings are considered to be valid ethnic groups, \\"Klemantan\\" was basically a catch- all category that contained every native group that could not otherwise be fitted into the existing 5 categories. Thus, by his definition, a Klemantan was every native Bornean who was not an Iban, a Kayan, a Kenyah, a Murut or a Punan. This in Hose's eyes did not only include numerous smaller groups and communities within Sarawak, but also the native groups living in the Dutch part of Borneo at that time, about whom Charles Hose had no first-hand knowledge. Later scholars disclaimed the existence of the Klemantan people as a valid ethnic category, as the term merely represents a European view-point rather than the people's own and ultimately was made up for pure convenience. French cultural anthropologist J√©r√¥me Rousseau, for example, forwarded the question why Hose \\"felt compelled to invent a concept which corresponds to no social, cultural, geographical, or historical reality.\\" Klemantan and Kalimantan The modern-day Indonesian name for Borneo island, Kalimantan, is derived from the same root as Klemantan.

She was professionally active between 1945 and 1950, making eight soundies, two motion pictures and releasing a couple of singles. Life and career Vannie Smith was born in Detroit, Michigan, United States. The third of eight children, her parents were Grady and Gertrude McCray Smith, and she was named after her maternal grandmother, Lou Vannie Donaldson. In a professional capacity she was first mentioned in the Indianapolis Recorder in August 1945, named as Vannie Smith and being the star of Billy Williams' Creole Follies, a week-long show at the 440 Club. However, the following month she appeared billed as Vanita Smythe at the Cotton Club in Buffalo, New York. She came to the attention of the fledgling film director, William Forest Crouch, who produced and directed soundies through Filmcraft Productions in New York. Between January and May 1946, Smythe was filmed in eight of them. Several of the soundies also featured the pianist and songwriter Dan Burley or fellow songwriter Claude Demetrius. Smythe's roles varied, incorporating some acting and singing, and several of the songs within the soundies were written by notables such as Louis Jordan, Hot Lips Page, Burley and Demetrius. The following year, Smythe's filmed rendition of \\"They Raided the Joint\\" was integrated into Ebony Parade, an Astor Pictures film that opened in New York in early July. The film was a collection of old soundies, each introduced by the \\"fortune teller\\", Mantan Moreland. Through these connections, Smythe was cast as \\"Rusty\\", in Louis Jordan's 1947 Astor Pictures film, Reet, Petite, and Gone, which was also produced and directed by Crouch. In April 1947, Smythe performed at Henry Armstrong's Melody Room in Harlem on the same bill as the 5 Kings. In June she trod the boards again at Smalls Paradise in Harlem, in a one-night show put on by Dan Burley. In October, she appeared as part of the annual benefit dance put on by the Good Hearts Welfare Association at Harlem's Renaissance Ballroom. Smythe's career went into a hiatus before signing in March 1950 to Regal Records. She recorded four tracks for the label; \\"Lonesome For You\\", \\"I Want My Baby Back\\", \\"Until I Fell For You\\" (written by Howard Biggs), and \\"You Got Me Crying Again\\". \\"Lonesome For You\\" / \\"I Want My Baby Back\\" was issued as a single early in 1950, whilst \\"Until I Fell For You\\" / \\"You Got Me Crying Again\\" was released later the same year. Neither record was a commercial success. The sum total of her stage performances did not run into double figures, and all of them took place around New York City. Smythe married in 1951 and her professional career came to a close. Vanita Smythe Pauling died in Detroit on January 18, 1994, aged 69. Family life On March 23, 1951, Smythe married Clarence Otto Pauling in Springfield, Tennessee. The groom was the brother of Lowman \\"Pete\\" Pauling, Jr. of the \\"5\\" Royales. Clarence and Vanita were later divorced, on a date probably between 1960 and 1966. There is no definitive record of any children of the union.

He served as managing partner of The U.S. Russia Investment Fund (TUSRIF) and Delta Capital Management and chairman and CEO of GE Capital in Russia. He was the co-founder of Aurora Russia Limited, AIM-listed private equity firm active in Russia. He was instrumental in turning around Russia's financial system after the 1998 Russian financial crisis, when he launched the first mortgage bank in Russia and became known as the \\"father of mortgage lending\\" in Russia. He later introduced the first revolving credit card in Russia and launched a nationwide leasing company in Russia. Recently, he was a major fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. Early life James Cook grew up in Richmond, Virginia. He graduated from Hampden‚ÄìSydney College, and he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in finance from the Virginia Tech Pamplin College of Business. He also graduated from the Mortgage Bankers Association's School of Mortgage Banking. Career Cook worked in marketing for the Virginia Tech Credit Union while he was in college. He subsequently worked as a loan officer for the Investors Savings Bank in Richmond. By 1988, he joined the Virginia Housing Development Authority as a compliance officer. Cook went to work as deputy director of the Urban Institute in Russia in 1994, where he was tasked with teaching Russian bankers about mortgages. He began working for Delta Capital Management in 1996, only to be promoted as its senior vice president in 2000. Meanwhile, by 1999, he also served as the senior vice president of The U.S. Russia Investment Fund (TUSRIF), an investment fund managed by Delta Capital. Cook offered his first mortgage at the Delta Capital Management in 1997. As most Russians had never taken loans before, Cook and other bankers turned to ex-KGB officers to do background checks for them. Cook was appointed as the chairman and chief executive officer of GE Consumer Finance, a Russia- based subsidiary of General Electric, in 2004. He also served on the boards of directors of OSG, Unistream, Fora Bank, Kreditmart, DeltaBank, DeltaCredit, Europlan, Flexinvest Bank, and the ICICI Bank in Russia. Cook co-founded Aurora Russia Limited, a private equity firm, in 2006. The firm attracted $150 million, and it was listed on the Alternative Investment Market, a submarket of the London Stock Exchange, until 2016. Meanwhile, the two men created three businesses with the fund, including KreditMart, a mortgage and consumer loan firm. Cook believes that the 1998 Russian financial crisis \\"was the best thing that could have happened\\" to Russian banks, as it taught them to diversify their assets.

The number of Syrians in Turkey is estimated at over 3.5 million people as of March 2020, and consists mainly of refugees of the Syrian Civil War. In 2017, Syrian citizens accounted for 24% of all work permits granted to foreign nationals, making Syrians the largest single group of foreign nationals with work permits. Following the Turkish military intervention in the Afrin District in Northern Syria against the Kurdish YPG militia, some Turkish politicians have suggested that Syrian refugees in Turkey should be repatriated to Syria.

Biography Kwok was born on 6 December 1938 to Kwok Lam-po and Sylvia Li Yuet-sheung. His grandfather, Kwok Chuen, was the founder of the Wing On Company, one of the major Chinese department stores, while his mother, Sylvia Li, was the daughter of Li Shek-pang, the founder of the Li family, one of the four big families of Hong Kong. Kwok was educated at the St. Paul's Co-Educational College and graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a bachelor's degree of science in Physics. He later obtained master and doctoral degrees in Physics in Harvard University. He worked as a researcher at the IBM after his studies. He returned to Hong Kong to help his family business at Wing On in 1970 and became the chairman of the company in 1983. During the Hong Kong dollar crisis in 1985, the Wing On Bank was bailed out by Hang Seng Bank. For this reason Kwok resigned from the chairman of the company and remained as director. He was an appointed member of the Urban Council and was the vice-chairman of the Progressive Hong Kong Society headed by the then member of the Executive and Legislative Councils Maria Tam. In 1985, he was appointed by the Beijing government to the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee and became its vice-chairman. He formed the Group of 89, a conservative faction consisting of businessmen and professionals who advocated for a slower pace of democratisation in the committee. He first joined the New Hong Kong Alliance headed by Lo Tak-shing in 1989 but soon quit the party over the controversy of the political model of the SAR government after 1997. In 1990, he co-founded the Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong, a conservative pro-business party with other Group of 89 members including Hu Fa-kuang where he became the founding vice-chairman. He was appointed Hong Kong Affairs Adviser in 1993. Kwok is appointed member of the Council of the Hong Kong Baptist University in 2005. He was made Justice of the Peace in 1979. In 2003, he was awarded Silver Bauhinia Star. Personal life He is also an honorary non-voting member of the Hong Kong Jockey Club and chairman of the Shotokan Karate International of Hong Kong. He currently resides at the Holly Court, 1 Holly Road, Happy Valley, Hong Kong. Kwok is married to Maxine Kwok Li Yuen-kwan, daughter of Dr. Li Shu-pui and Ellen Li.

Rieger is also an ordained minister of the United Methodist Church.  Life and career  Born on August 3, 1963, Rieger is Cal Turner Chancellor's Chair in Wesleyan Studies and Distinguished Professor of Theology at the Divinity School and the Graduate Program of Religion at Vanderbilt University. Previously he was the Wendland-Cook Endowed Professor of Constructive Theology at Perkins School of Theology, Southern Methodist University. He received a Master of Divinity degree from the , Germany, a Master of Theology degree from Duke Divinity School, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in religion and ethics from Duke University. Rieger is the author and editor of more than 20 books and over 135 academic articles, which have been translated into Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, German, Korean, and Chinese. Rieger is editor of the academic book series New Approaches to Religion and Power with Palgrave Macmillan Publishers and, together with Kwok Pui-lan, he edits the academic book series Religion in the Modern World (Rowman and Littlefield). Rieger has lectured throughout the United States as well as internationally, including presentations in Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Mexico, Canada, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Slovakia, the Netherlands, Belgium, England, Russia, Thailand, and China.  Ideas  Rieger is an activist constructive theologian in the tradition of liberation theology. Robert Wafawanaka has referred to Reiger as an \\"Occupy theologian\\" because he endorses the views of the Occupy movement and shares its ethos. Rieger understands theology as functioning to support or transform reality, especially historical and contemporary economic systems. His work focuses on economic class and empire. In politics, Rieger argues against the separation of religion and politics. Rieger describes his work as an effort to bring theology and contemporary liberation movements together. His work addresses the relation of theology and public life, reflecting on the misuse of power in religion, politics, and economics. His main interest is in developments and movements that bring about change and in the positive contributions of religion and theology. His work in theology draws on a wide range of historical and contemporary traditions, with a concern for manifestations of the divine in the pressures of everyday life. Rieger advocates for a materialistic spirituality centered on working to improve the material conditions of the marginalized. He believes current economic systems are incompatible with the biblical conception of God. Rieger has described economic ideologies as religions, and asserts that people typically assent to them as a matter of blind faith, not empirical evidence. He renounces the perceived hegemony of free market ideology offering Christian theology as an alternative. Rieger's criticizes the currently dominant economic system especially for increasing global economic inequality, and also for poverty, distorting of the way people and their work are valued, and limiting control people have over their lives. As a response to economic injustice, Rieger promotes solidarity with those negatively impacted by current economic processes and encourages Christians to modify economic systems to promote the wellbeing of everyone. Rieger and Kwok Pui-lan coined the notion of deep solidarity, which is a recognition that the community as a whole is harmed by the unjust system, not just a particular group to be paternalistically supported from a place of superiority or distance. Within this framework, the presence of college-educated individuals participating in the Occupy movement is not lack of authenticity in their appeal for economic justice, but rather an achievement in helping a broader portion of the public identify themselves as oppressed and able to see inequality as a threat to society as whole.
