From 1998 to 1999, he served as Coordinating Minister for the Peoples' Welfare in the Indonesian Development Cabinet. Suyono also wrote former President Soeharto's address to the UN assembly. Early life Dr. Haryono Suyono was born in a small town in Java island, the most heavily populated of the major Indonesian islands. He is one of three sons born to a school teacher and a business woman. He has a PhD degree in demography, sociology and communication from University of Chicago in the US. Before his doctorate studies, he worked with a pilot FP project in Jakarta where his interest and commitment to population began. There were very few people with advanced degrees in population and demography in Indonesia at that time. Career While doing his doctorate degree in the late 1960s, Dr Haryono saw the opportunity to be a professional leader. He conducted workshops on population while at Chicago, and it was at one of these workshops where he came in contact with the Indonesian government family planning officials. He started his 30-year-plus tenure at BKKBN as a deputy director. While a deputy at BKKBN, he was involved in writing speeches for President Suharto which would inevitably include messages on family planning. He was head of BKKBN for 15 years, during which time the Indonesian program grew by leaps and bounds. He was Minister of Population and Minister Coordinator for Social Welfare, and also Chairman of LCOMP Executive Committee for two terms in the 1990s. He is Founder and Chairman of Yayasan Dana Sejahtera Mandiri, a foundation that promotes self-reliance and human development. He is also on the faculty of the School of Medicine at Airlangga University in Java, and host of radio programs on health and family. Note: Decentralization of the Indonesian family planning program began in 2000, a process in which the transferred mandate of the program has a direction and implementation from a central level to the provinces and districts. The current role of BKKBN has since changed dramatically from the days when Dr Haryono was at the helm.

The church was described by Queen Elizabeth I as \\"the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England.\\", There are 100 Grade I listed buildings in Bristol, England according to Bristol City Council. The register includes many structures which for convenience are grouped together in the list below. In the United Kingdom, the term listed building refers to a building or other structure officially designated as being of special architectural, historical or cultural significance; Grade I structures are those considered to be \\"buildings of exceptional interest\\". Listing was begun by a provision in the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. Listing a building imposes severe restrictions on what the owner might wish to change or modify in the structure or its fittings. In England, the authority for listing under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 rests with Historic England, a non- departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, while local authorities have a responsibility to regulate and enforce the planning regulations. The oldest Grade I listed buildings in Bristol are religious. St James' Priory was founded in 1129 as a Benedictine priory by Robert, Earl of Gloucester, the illegitimate son of Henry I. The building is on the Historic England Buildings at Risk Register and described as being in very bad condition. The second oldest is The Cathedral Church of the Holy and Undivided Trinity which is more commonly known as Bristol Cathedral and its associated Gatehouse. Founded in 1140, the church became the seat of the bishop and cathedral of the new Diocese of Bristol in 1542. Most of the medieval stonework, particularly the Elder Lady Chapel, is made from limestone taken from quarries around Dundry and Felton with Bath stone being used in other areas. Amongst the other churches included in the list is the 12th century St Mary Redcliffe which is the tallest building in Bristol. The church was described by Queen Elizabeth I as \\"the fairest, goodliest, and most famous parish church in England.\\" The New Room was built in 1739 by John Wesley and is the oldest Methodist chapel in the world. Secular buildings include The Red Lodge which was built in 1580 for John Yonge as a lodge for a Great House, which once stood on the site of the present Colston Hall. It was subsequently added to in Georgian times and restored in the early 20th century. It has had several uses in its past, including hosting the country's first girls' reform school in 1854. It is open to the public as a branch of Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. Other manor houses include the 18th century Kings Weston House and Goldney Hall where the highly decorated Grotto dates from 1739. Commercial buildings such as paired Exchange and Old Post Office from the 1740s are also included in the list. Residential buildings in the Georgian Portland Square and the complex of small cottages around a green at Blaise Hamlet. Blaise Hamlet was built around 1811 for retired employees of Quaker banker and philanthropist John Scandrett Harford, who owned Blaise Castle House. The 18th century industrial structures of Isambard Kingdom Brunel are represented in the list by the Clifton Suspension Bridge, Avon Bridge and the Bristol Old Station which formed the original Bristol Temple Meads railway station.

Lineage  The son of Ranulph de Mortimer, he was Lord of Wigmore Castle, Stratfield Mortimer, Cleobury Mortimer and at times, Bridgnorth, Bishop's Castle and Maelienydd.  Anarchy  During the Anarchy of King Stephen's reign, Mortimer was an ardent royalist until at least 1148. This was because Wigmore Castle had been confiscated from his father by King Henry I. He only seems to have returned to England from his Norman estates in 1137.  Private Wars  He did quarrel violently with his neighbouring Lords, most notably with Miles, earl of Hereford, his son Roger and Josce de Dinan, lord of Ludlow. The latter ambushed Mortimer and only released him after the payment of a substantial ransom. During this time Mortimer also took over the Royal castle at Bridgnorth.  Opposition to King Henry II  Hugh was one of the Barons who objected to Henry II's demand for the return of Royal castles in 1155. Henry II launched a campaign in May 1155 against Hugh, simultaneously besieging his three principal castles of Wigmore, Bridgnorth and Cleobury. On 7 July 1155, Hugh formally submitted to Henry II at the Council at Bridgnorth. He was allowed to keep his own two castles (though Cleobury had been destroyed during the siege) but Bridgnorth returned to the crown.Warren, p. 60-61  Marriage and children  Between 1148 and 1155 Hugh married Maud le Meschin (also known as Maud/Matilde du Bessin), daughter of William Meschin, Lord of Skipton, Yorkshire, and Cecily de Rumilly. Maud (Matilda) was the widow of Philip Belmeis of Tong. Hugh and Maud's son Roger Mortimer of Wigmore succeeded his father as Lord of Wigmore. Hugh and Maud had three other sons, Hugh (killed in a tournament), Ralph, and William. Hugh may have died 26 Feb 1180/81 in Cleobury Mortimer, Shropshire, England, and was buried at Wigmore.

A native of Dolomite, Alabama, Lehner batted and threw left-handed. Listed at tall and , he was nicknamed \\"Peanuts\\" or \\"Gulliver.\\" He worked in the region's coal mines as a young man. Biography Lehner's 1951 Bowman Gum card Lehner's professional baseball career began when he was 25, after World War II service in the United States Army Air Forces. He was one of a few big leaguers to play for four different teams in a single season. He reached the majors in 1946 with the St. Louis Browns, spending four years with them before moving to the Philadelphia Athletics in 1950. He started 1951 with Philadelphia, then was part of successive trades between the Athletics, Chicago White Sox, Browns, and Cleveland Indians. His most productive season came in 1950 with Philadelphia, when he posted career-highs in batting average (.309), home runs (9), and RBI (52) in 114 games. He also played briefly for the Boston Red Sox in 1952, his last major league season. When playing with the Browns, Lehner believed that he could not hit safely if he played on a Sunday. He would approach the Browns' trainer with an alleged ailment that would keep him out of the line-up for a Sunday game. When Lehner finally admitted to the trainer of his problem, the trainer said that he had some new pills that could help him. Lehner took the pills before a Sunday double-header, hit a home run in the first game, and never tried to be excused from Sunday games again. In a seven-season career, Lehner was a .257 hitter with 22 home runs and 197 RBI in 540 games. Lehner died in Birmingham, Alabama, at the age of 47.

On March 29, 2006, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney of Georgia had a dispute with Capitol Police. McKinney entered the Longworth House Office Building's southeast entrance after walking around the metal detector at the security checkpoint. She proceeded westward down the ground floor hallway and about halfway down the hallway was grabbed by United States Capitol Police officer Paul McKenna who states that he had been calling after her \\"Ma'am, Ma'am!\\" Two days later Officer McKenna filed a police report claiming that McKinney had \\"struck his chest with a closed fist.\\" Members of Congress are not required to pass through metal detectors but they are asked to wear identifying lapel pins. The incident made national headlines and sparked controversies over whether the officers present failed to recognize her as a Member of Congress because she was not wearing the appropriate lapel pin, whether McKinney had just cause to assert that racial profiling played a role in the incident, whether Members of Congress should be required to pass through metal detectors, and even whether McKinney's recent change of hair-style contributed to the incident. Police report, media attention and charges Officer McKenna did not arrest McKinney at the time of the incident. He filed a police report later. The following is his exact statement, with C-1 referring to himself and S-1 to Rep. McKinney: \\"On 3-29-06, at approximately 0855 hrs. C-1 while performing his official duties as United States Capitol Police Officer and in full uniform, stated that he was physically assaulted by S-1. S-1 struck C-1 in his chest with a closed fist.\\" ; Since the altercation took place halfway down the hall, the only thing the security cameras at the checkpoint could have captured is McKinney walking past the metal detector and turning left down the hall and off the camera, and the subsequent pursuit by Officer McKenna. U.S. Capitol Police clarified that the altercation was not captured on security camera. Congressional pin debate McKinney was criticized in the media for failing to wear her pin on the morning of March 29, 2006, with critics charging that her failure to do so led to the confrontation. Many other Members have not worn the pin since the McKinney-McKenna affair. A July 5, 2006 article in The Hill titled \\"Pinpoint: After McKinney, many lawmakers still dress without their congressional pins\\" noted \\"no discernible pattern\\" in the decision by Members of Congress regarding the wearing of the Congressional Pin. Several members indicated they followed the same practice as McKinney. House Majority Leader Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) said that he was \\"not a pin-wearing guy.\\" Another Republican Member, Sherwood Boehlert (NY) explained his reason for not wearing a pin, stating \\"I know who I am.\\" Democratic Member George Miller (CA) said \\"I've never worn one. I have enough trouble combing my hair in the morning.\\" McKinney admitted that she was not wearing her pin that morning but opined that the police responsible for protecting lawmakers should recognize the 435 members of Congress on sight and claimed to have shown her Congressional identification badge.See, e.g., A. Jabari, McKinney's Hair & Affair, in The Washington Post, 4/10/06) Initial reactions McKinney made a brief statement on her own behalf at Howard University on March 31: \\"Let me be clear: this whole incident was instigated by the inappropriate touching and stopping of me, a female black congresswoman. I deeply regret this incident occurred, and I am certain that after a full review of the facts, I will be exonerated.\\" McKinney garnered little support. Not one Congressional Democrat chose to join her at a news conference to discuss the situation at Howard University, although Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton sent a supportive statement to be read at the event. Initially stating on March 31 that she \\"wouldn't make a big deal\\" out of the incident,Hitting a Police Officer 'No Big Deal?' Republicans Ask - 03/31/2006 Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Cal.) later said on April 5 that she \\"found it hard to see any set of facts that would justify striking a police officer,\\" and McKinney's fellow Georgia Democrat, Rep. John Lewis, told McKinney that \\"she needs to lower the temperature and stop holding press conferences.\\" Outside of Capitol Hill, the Sarasota Democratic Party withdrew from a rally at which McKinney was due to speak. McKinney declined to discuss the details of the altercation in subsequent media interviews. She has not formally shared her side of the altercation with the public, including: (1) whether she had heard the officer calling after her, or if so, knew that she was the \\"Ma'am\\" being called; (2) whether she was aware that an officer of the law was grabbing her, and therefore, assuming she swung her arm in a retaliatory motion; (3) whether she was aware that she was striking an officer of the law, and also; (4) the amount of force behind the alleged blow. The basic facts of the event, aside from McKinney's failure to wear her pin, thus remain in dispute. However, no one, including McKinney, has ever explained why she has never told her side of the story, or attempted to clear up any dispute in the facts. Race in the incident and aftermath The story was picked up by many blogs and internet opinion sites with overwhelming rebuke for McKinney coming from conservatives and also left-leaning sources offering negative portrayals of her, as on the comedy show Saturday Night Live, which lampooned her repeatedly on their April 8, 2006 show for \\"playing the race card.\\" On April 3, former Wonkette editor Ana Marie Cox, interviewed on Joe Scarborough's MSNBC show Scarborough Country, said that \\"I worry that she [McKinney] makes us [Democrats] all look a little crazy.\\" Some columnists analyzed her hairstyle in a negative light and question the quick participation of musician/actor/social activist Harry Belafonte. Reacting to the sudden rise in stakes reflected by the potential for criminal indictment McKinney's attorney, James Myart, spoke in a March 31 news conference suggesting that the officer involved be criminally investigated for accosting (\\"inappropriately touching\\") the congresswoman. This charge was not taken seriously by most commentators and media outlets. Myart said the case typified a pattern of police harassment of black Americans. \\"...my belief is this is no different than that: 'they all look alike'. On April 25, 2006, CNN reported that Myart was no longer representing McKinney. Recently retired U.S. Capitol Police Chief Terrance W. Gainer rejected Myart's charge in an interview with CNN: :\\"I've seen our officers stop white members and black members, Latinos, male and females ... It's not an issue about what your race or gender is. It's an issue about making sure people who come into our building are recognized if they're not going through the magnetometer, and this officer at that moment didn't recognize her ... It would have been real easy, as most members of Congress do, to say 'here's who I am' or 'do you know who I am?'\\" McKinney has repeatedly stated the incident arose from McKenna's failure to recognize her face, suggesting that a pattern of incidents in which Capitol Police failed to recognize her as a Member of Congress had to do with a general tendency by police in the United States to engage in racial profiling of blacks and therefore tend to handle blacks more roughly. Apology On April 6, 2006, after the grand jury was convened to investigate, the Associated Press reported that McKinney had expressed \\"sincere regret\\" for the altercation and offered an apology to the House. \\"There should not have been any physical contact in this incident,\\" McKinney said in a one-minute statement on the House floor. Various commentators, including The Wall Street Journal questioned the sincerity of the apology, noting, among other things, its careful wording, the lack of admission of culpability, and the absence of an apology specifically to the Capitol Police and Officer McKenna. Potential legal consequences News reports variously suggested that the police officer as an individual, or the Capitol Police as a whole, were planning to file assault charges. On April 3, 2006, Assistant U.S. Attorney Channing Phillips announced that the Capitol Police had referred the incident to his office for further investigation. On April 5, the Associated Press reported that the case might be referred to a federal grand jury. A sitting Grand Jury was subsequently presented with McKenna's charge of assault of a police officer. Six witnesses were called by the U.S. Attorney's office. Charges dropped On June 16, 2006, the grand jury declined to indict McKinney, finding insufficient grounds to proceed.My Way Under 18 U.S.C. ¬ß111(a), McKinney faced a fine and/or up to eight years in prison if convicted of assaulting an \\"officer or employee of the United States.\\" It was suggested on Fox News that McKinney's allegations of racism and sexism were overplayed on her part and had a boomerang effect. McKinney's supporters argued that the reporting of the incident presumed her guilty until proven innocent, and that her conservative opponents overplayed their hand by attacking her in such vicious terms: On March 31, libertarian radio host Neal Boortz said McKinney \\"looks like a \\"Ghetto slut\\".The Neal Boortz Show, March 31, 2006. Though not indicted for criminal charges or subjected to disciplinary action by the House, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police said of Officer McKenna, ‚ÄúWe're going to make sure the officer won't be harassed. We want the officer to be able talk to experts, who can look at his legal recourses, if he needed to.\\" References Category:Congressional scandals Category:Congressional controversies in the United States Category:Cynthia McKinney Category:United States Capitol Police Category:2006 in Washington, D.C.

She wrote this poem while attending Smith College and described it as being one of her favorite poems that she had written. \\"Mad Girl's Love Song\\" was originally published in Mademoiselle, a New York based magazine geared toward young women.This poem was first formally published during the same month of her first suicide attempt.  Form  The poem is written in the villanelle or villanesque form of poetry, which contains nineteen lines. These lines consist of five tercets and a quatrain at the end. Two lines of the opening tercet, the first and the third, are known as refrains and are repeated alternately throughout the poem as the final lines of the following tercets. In this poem, the refrains are the lines \\"I think I made you up inside my head\\" and \\"I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead\\". Villanelle poems have an intricate rhyme scheme of ABA ABA ABA ABA ABA ABAA using only two different sounds.  Themes and symbolism  \\"Mad Girl's Love Song\\" portrays a young woman who has lost a love that was very significant to her. While dealing with this loss, the narrator is having a struggle with her own mind about if this lover was real or is she made them up inside of her head. This confusion about the narrator's own sanity is significant since it is widely known that Plath herself struggled greatly with mental health and this poem was written only a couple of months before her first attempted suicide in 1953. This is a confessional poem in which Plath unashamedly writes about a narrator with themes of depression and even schizophrenia. The poem uses religious figures and symbols, including God, Satan and his men, Seraphim, and Hell. In this poem, the religious figures and symbols that she uses are ultimately destroyed, symbolizing her mental state deteriorating because of the loss of her love that was so vital to her. Plath gives the stars in \\"Mad Girl's Love Song\\" the ability to 'waltz' while making darkness able to 'gallop in,' an example of personification. She also uses many allusions in this poem. In the fourth stanza of \\"Mad Girl's Love Song\\" readers can see religious allusions referring to \\"God toppling from the sky\\" and \\"Hell's fires fading\\" that signal to the reader that the narrator's belief in religion is crumbling around her because of the loss of her vital lover. The references to 'Seraphim' and 'Satan's men' also continue these religious allusions.  Feminism  The legacy of Sylvia Plath as a confessional poet who fully embodied the role of a somewhat angsty and woman Plath's work is considered by many non-radical feminists to be a voice that clearly communicates the anger of women, as well as their feminine energy and fears, while many radical feminists insist that she does not have the interests of women at heart and that her work is filled with patriarchal ideologies. \\"Mad Girl's Love Song\\" has some religious references that ended up being mostly destroyed in the last few stanzas; Plath believed that traditional religion was mostly useless to women, as it normally only had the interests and values of men in mind. Years after the publication of Mad Girl's Love Song\\" she wrote a feminist critique of the Christian religion in which she states that the concept of the holy Trinity is completely made up by men for men. These ideas about religion and feminism that she had can explain the symbols of religion in \\"Mad Girl's Love Song\\" being deteriorated by the narrator after losing her lover.

Starting with Andrew Denton in 1990, Rage has a long tradition of inviting a band or artist host the show for the Saturday night episode. The hosts select and introduce their favourite music videos from the Rage library. This gives an insight into the bands' and artists' influences, which are highly regarded by fans whose tapings of the program are highly sought after. Rage has had hundreds of artists host the show over its vast history, as well as politicians, comedians, writers, TV hosts and other figures in the music and entertainment industry. Bernard Fanning and Tex Perkins have guest programmed the show the most, having appeared 5 times apiece. Rage often filmed their guest presenters in various hotels, backstage green rooms, bars, and parts of the ABC building, including the Triple J conference room in Ultimo, Sydney. They now mostly film out of their own purpose-built Rage studio in ABC Ultimo, Sydney, but also at live music tours, festivals all over Australia, and occasionally in musician's homes and hotels. The 2019 Paul Kelly Ausmusic Month special guest hosting was filmed in the musician's St Kilda home during October 2019.

Debut In April 1998 the band (as Lemming) released a self-financed debut The Search EP. It consists of five songs, recorded in a cheap and obscure studio in Amsterdam in two days. Mainstream pop critics were positive about the recordings, and Flemming was offered a spot on the main stage of the London Calling festival in Paradiso, Amsterdam in October 1998. Flemming then played at the annual Noorderslag Festival in Groningen. Warner Music offered Flemming a recording contract and preparations for the recording of the first full-length album, to be produced by label mate Tom Pintens of Flemish band Zita Swoon, were made. Name change Because of legal problems concerning a reunion tour of 1970s horror rock act Lemming the band name was officially changed to \\"Flemming\\". In July 2000, Flemming's official self-titled debut was released. Dutch established pop watchers and critics were positive about the album. Pop magazine LiveXS chose the album as album of the month. The first single released from the album was the song \\"Name?\\". The promotional video in which the band performed the song next to the set of an adult movie was banned from the Dutch music channel TMF during day time. A censored version did reach day time television. While promoting their debut album in Dutch live circuit Flemming also made numerous appearances on Dutch TV and radio during 2000/2001. Programs like 2-metersessies, TMF Caf√© and De Plantage featured TV performances of the band. On the radio Flemming performed on Leidsekade live, BNN Live and Isabelle. In 2001, Flemming played at the Noorderslag Festival once more, and in May 2001 \\"Starry Night\\" became the second single from the debut album. The song was orchestrated by Robert Kirby, well known for his work with English singer-songwriter Nick Drake (1948‚Äì1974). Second album In 2002 Flemming recorded the second album We love the Industry. It was however not released until February 2004, because Warner Music dropped all artists signed to the Dutch branch of the company. We love the Industry was released by independent label Idol Media. The first single drawn from it was titled \\"Old Boys\\". The arrangement was by Robert Kirby, and also featured Dutch female singer Birgit Schuurman.

Lady Penh was a wealthy lady who lived on the outskirts of a village located in present-day Phnom Penh. During the flood of the Mekong river, a hollow tree floated up to her lawn, and in the tree were four bronze statues of the Buddha. She saw this as a sign that the Buddha wanted a new home, so she built a temple for the Buddha. This temple is now believed to be the one in the capital city of Phnom Penh. The Temple that Lady Penh created grew famous, and was visited by throngs of pilgrims. When Siam invaded Angkor a hundred years later, the capital city of Cambodia was moved to Phnom Penh. In Khmer language, \\"Phnom\\" means \\"Hill\\", so the city Phnom Penh means \\"the hill of the lady Penh\\".

Before 1995, in Hungary, it was made by a factory called Traubi HungariaTraubisoda located in the village of Balatonvil√°gos. The company produces the drink from a special type of Hungarian grapes, called saszla. The name Traubi derives from the German word Trauben that means grape. Visiting the factory in Balatonvil√°gos one can follow the steps of production from grapes harvest to bottling. In Austria, it's produced by Waldquelle Kobersdorf GmbH from Kobersdorf. A Croatian company Trento sokovi licenses it from Waldquelle since 2006, and produces it in Brestovac.  The History of Traubi  The aroma was originally invented by Lenz Moser of Austria in 1954. It was licensed to Traubi Hungaria in 1971. The new flavour became popular not only due to the successful advertisement but also as it appeared to be the first Hungarian fizzy drink. As a result of the growing interest, Traubi was also produced in Kunbaja, Cs√°ny and in Debrecen. In response to the first fizzy drink success, in 1973 another product, called M√°rka, appeared on the Hungarian market. This drink proved to be popular that time just as well it is nowadays. M√°rka is liked for its special orange, grape, sour cherry and raspberry flavor. In the 1980s, due to the spread of Coca-Cola, Traubi became less popular, the production decreased by 20%. In 1992, Traubi Hungaria bought the factory of the Traubi in Balatonvil√°gos. However, in 1995, the trademark itself of \\"Traubi\\" and the licence to produce this soft drink was bought by the R√°thonyi Ltd, after the bankruptcy of the Lenz Moser Ltd. Since 1995 both Traubi Hungaria and the R√°thonyi Ltd used the same trademark, which resulted in a two decades long criminal and civil trial between these two parties. Salamon Berkowitz, the owner of the company Traubi Hungaria claimed that the original publicity campaign team, which had created the first campaign, was working on the company's advertisements and image. Despite these and the fact that Berkowitz used the former Traubi factory in Balatonvil√°gos and uses the same name as the original producer company had, several court rulings decided in favour of the R√°thonyi Ltd and condemned Berkowitz for fraud, tax evasion, and trademark infringement and imposed a fine on him and his accomplices.http://www.sonline.hu/somogy/kozelet/jogeros- tobb-millio-palack-hamis-traubi-651122  Popularity  A bottle Traubisoda The popularity of the drink was tested through a market research conducted by the producer. The findings clearly showed, that there was a strong nostalgia for the drink among Hungarians who were teenagers in the '80s. Drinking Traubi evokes memories from Hungarian people‚Äôs past, therefore a special importance belongs to this drink.  M√°rka  M√°rka is another soft drink product of the Traubi Hungaria. Its production started in 1973 and it is still popular. The company makes it in orange, grape, sour cherry and raspberry flavour.

Potts was born in Norwich, England, to an English father then serving in the Royal Navy, and an Irish mother. He started school in northern Scotland, and continued in various parts of England, before entering Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, to study medical sciences. He subsequently transferred to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study clinical medicine, and while there rowed for Oxford University (Isis) in the 1981 Boat Race. He continued medical studies in the United States, before returning to London and then Edinburgh to specialise in psychiatry. He works part-time as a Consultant in Liaison Psychiatry in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, mainly in the emergency department and kidney, liver and pancreas transplant services. He took up writing for children in the 1990s, beginning with a loosely connected trilogy collectively known as The Running Tide. The three books cover the period from the mid 19th century to the present day, and are variously set in Britain, Greenland and the Aleutian islands. Described as ‚Äúgood, old-fashioned tales of courage and adventure‚Äù (Observer, 2001) they pit child protagonists against the dangers of the ocean and the polar ice, as well as malevolent adults. His most recent book, Abigail‚Äôs Gift, tells intertwined stories of a Highland lass at the time of the Clearances, and a modern schoolgirl troubled by bullying and an overactive imagination. In March 2007 he was commissioned by Dynamic Entertainment DEH, a Dutch independent film production company, to adapt Philip Pullman‚Äôs 1992 novel The Butterfly Tattoo (previously published as The White Mercedes) as a feature film, released theatrically and on DVD in 2009.

Fictional character biography=Origin Ollie Osnick makes his debut as Spider-Kid in Amazing Spider-Man #263. Art by Ron Frenz. Ollie Osnick is an overweight, gifted teenager who idolized Doctor Octopus. Using his genius, Ollie designs his own mechanical tentacles and calls himself Kid Ock. He influences a group of kids to dress up as super- villains, but they soon ran out on him. Ollie eventually runs away from home and breaks into a toy store.The Spectacular Spider-Man #72 There, he renders an elderly guard unconscious, although Ollie believes he has killed him. When Spider-Man arrives on the scene, he believes that it was actually Dr. Octopus at work, so he chases Ollie. Spider-Man realizes in time that it was not Ock he was facing. When Spider-Man and Ollie fall into a water tank, Spider-Man easily rips apart a tentacle, something that he was never able to do with Ock. Dragging Ollie to the surface, he learns it was actually Ollie he was chasing. By then the guard regains consciousness, and Spider-Man returns Ollie home safely.The Amazing Spider-Man #262 Impressed with Spider-Man, Ollie modifies his tentacles into spider-legs and dons a Spider-Man Halloween costume, calling himself the Spider-Kid. Ollie's heroic activities often resulted in him having to be saved by Spider-Man.The Amazing Spider-Man #263 He was involved (along with Frog-Man and the Toad) in a short-lived super-hero team called The Misfits. Ollie was eventually convinced to hang up his costume and became a normal child.The Amazing Spider-Man #266 However, in his college years, Ollie had radically changed. He had devoted himself to exercise and became very athletic. Ollie still fantasized about being a hero, continuing to invent new weapons and modify his spider-legs. When his girlfriend was paralyzed by muggers, Ollie seeks revenge and creates the identity of \\"Steel Spider\\", donning a dark blue costume, and equipping himself with all of these new weapons (including gauntlets containing a grappling hook launcher and pepper spray blasters). Steel Spider locates and brutalizes his girlfriend's attackers. He removes his costume, realizing that he never wanted to be a vigilante and would rather build a life with the girl he loves.Spider-Man Unlimited #5 When Onslaught attacks New York City, he is mentioned to be one of the heroes helping against the invading Sentinels, working with Darkhawk and the New Warriors to retake the Brooklyn Bridge.Green Goblin #12 Civil War Equipped with a new set of arms, Ollie Osnick now displays a more rebellious attitude towards the Superhero Registration Act.

After successfully defeating Venom, Radioactive Man and Swordsman, he uses the gadgetry in his metal limbs to square up against Radioactive Man, Songbird, Venom and Penance, commenting that having allies \\"almost makes this a fair fight. I bet they weren't expecting that.\\" As the fight continues, Ollie seems to be holding his own until Venom unexpectedly bites off and eats Ollie's left arm.Thunderbolts #115 Ollie is later shown being incarcerated in Prison 42 in the Negative Zone.Thunderbolts #116 Powers and abilities Ollie Osnick has no superpowers but wears mechanical spider legs which allow him to climb.

He was the son of Hugh de Mortimer (d. 26 February 1181) and Matilda Le Meschin. Early life Roger would appear to have been of age in 1174 when he fought for King Henry II against the rebellion of his son, Henry. In 1179 Roger was instrumental in the killing of Cadwallon ap Madog, the prince of Maelienydd and Elfael, both of which Mortimer coveted. He was imprisoned until June 1182 at Winchester for this killing. Children He had married Isabel (d. before 29 April 1252), the daughter of Walchelin de Ferriers of Oakham Castle in Rutland before 1196. With Isabel, Roger had three sons and a daughter: *Hugh de Mortimer (d. 1227) ‚Äì married Annora (Eleanor) de Braose, daughter of William de Braose and his wife Maud *Ralph de Mortimer (d. 1246) * Philip Mortimer * Joan Mortimer (d. 1225) ‚Äì married May 1212 to Walter II de Beauchamp (1192-1236) and they had a son William III de Beauchamp (1215-1269) who married Isabella de Mauduit. They had a child William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick (1237‚Äì1298). Roger is often wrongly stated to have been the father of Robert Mortimer of Richards Castle (died 1219) - married Margary de Say, daughter of Hugh de Say. But this Robert was born before 1155 and therefore could not have been a son of Roger. Lord of Maelienydd In 1195 Roger, with the backing of troops sent by King Richard I, invaded Maelienydd and rebuilt Cymaron Castle. In 1196 he joined forces with Hugh de Say of Richards Castle and fought and lost the battle of New Radnor against Rhys ap Gruffydd, allegedly losing some forty knights and a large number of foot in the fight. By 1200 he had conquered Maelienydd and issued a new charter of rights to Cwmhir Abbey. In the summer of 1214 he became gravely ill and bought from King King John the right for his son to inherit his lands while he still lived. He died before 8 July 1214. ReferencesSources Remfry., P.

Retrieved May 25, 2020 His athletic prowess was highly rated by all Major League Baseball scouts, and when a bidding war ensued for his signing, he received a $200,000 ($ today) signing bonus from the Los Angeles Angels, a record for that time. It was the bidding war for Reichardt that ultimately led Major League Baseball to institute a draft, which started in 1965, with Rick Monday being the first ever #1 overall selection (he was drafted by the Kansas City Athletics). In 1966, Reichardt became the first player to hit a home run at Anaheim Stadium. Later that season, after batting .288 with 16 home runs and 44 RBI through just 89 games, he was diagnosed with a kidney ailment that necessitated the removal of the kidney. Although he recovered to hit .265 with 17 home runs in 1967, and .255 with 21 home runs in 1968, he was never quite the same after the operation. After hitting only 13 home runs in 1969, he was traded with Aurelio Rodr√≠guez to the Washington Senators early in the 1970 season for 3rd baseman Ken McMullen. After a trade to the White Sox in 1971, he managed to hit .278 with 19 homers. From there, age and injuries took their toll and he never again attained double figures in home runs in a season. He retired after 1 at-bat in the 1974 season.

He currently serves as the director of the US National Institutes of Health. In the book, Collins describes briefly the process by which he became a Christian. Collins raises arguments for the idea of God, drawing from science and philosophy. He cites many famous thinkers, most prevalently C. S. Lewis, as well as Saint Augustine, Stephen Hawking, Charles Darwin, Theodosius Dobzhansky and others. In 2007 Christianity Today judged it one of the best books of the previous year.http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/june/8.36.htmlaccessdate=2009-05-08} BioLogos The book proposes the name \\"BioLogos\\" as a new term for theistic evolution. The term has not gotten wide usage for the position, but instead became the name of the science and faith organization Collins founded in November 2007. The organization BioLogos now prefers the term evolutionary creation to describe its position. Bios is the Greek word for \\"life\\". Logos is Greek for \\"word\\", with a broader meaning in Heracleitean philosophy and Stoicism‚Äînamely the rational principle ordering the universe. This concept was appropriated by Christian theology. In Christian theology, \\"Word\\" is actually a creative agent for all that exists, in addition to being an ordering principle. Furthermore, in some Christian thinking the eternal and divine Logos merged and synthesized with a human nature to become Jesus Christ in the Incarnation. This is laid out in the opening prologue of the Gospel of John, forming part of the textual basis for Christian belief in the Trinity, as the concept of Logos morphed over time into God the Son for the second person of the Trinity.See Athanasius treatise The Incarnation of the Word of God \\"BioLogos\\" expresses the belief that God is the source of all life and that life expresses the will of God. BioLogos represents the view that science and faith co-exist in harmony.The Language of God: a Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief. Francis S. Collins. Simon & Schuster, 2006. . p.203 BioLogos rests on the following premises: # Bible is the inspired and authoritative word of God. By the Holy Spirit it is the ‚Äúliving and active‚Äù means through which God speaks to the church today, bearing witness to God‚Äôs Son, Jesus, as the divine Logos, or Word of God. # God also reveals himself in and through the natural world he created, which displays his glory, eternal power, and divine nature. Properly interpreted, Scripture and nature are complementary and faithful witnesses to their common Author. # All people have sinned against God and are in need of salvation. # They believe in the historical incarnation of Jesus Christ as fully God and fully man. It is by the historical death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, by which everyone is saved and reconciled to God. # God is directly involved in the lives of people today through acts of redemption, personal transformation, and answers to prayer. # God typically sustains the world using faithful, consistent processes that humans describe as ‚Äúnatural laws.‚Äù Yet they also affirm that God works outside of natural law in supernatural events, including the miracles described in Scripture. In both natural and supernatural ways, God continues to be directly involved in creation and in human history. # The methods of science are an important and reliable means to investigate and describe the world God has made. In this, they stand with a long tradition of Christians for whom Christian faith and science are mutually hospitable. Therefore, they reject ideologies such as Materialism and Scientism that claim science is the sole source of knowledge and truth, that science has debunked God and religion, or that the physical world constitutes the whole of reality. # They also believe that God created the universe, the earth, and all life over billions of years. God continues to sustain the existence and functioning of the natural world, and the cosmos continues to declare the glory of God. Therefore, they reject ideologies such as Deism that claim the universe is self-sustaining, that God is no longer active in the natural world, or that God is not active in human history. # The diversity and interrelation of all life on earth are best explained by the God-ordained process of evolution with common descent. Thus, evolution is not in opposition to God, but a means by which God providentially achieves his purposes. Therefore, they reject ideologies that claim that evolution is a purposeless process or that evolution replaces God. # God created humans in biological continuity with all life on earth, but also as spiritual beings. God established a unique relationship with humanity by endowing it with his image and calling it to an elevated position within the created order. # Conversations among Christians about controversial issues of science and faith can and must be conducted with humility, grace, honesty, and compassion as a visible sign of the Spirit‚Äôs presence in Christ‚Äôs body, the Church. Description Collins' conversion to Christianity is detailed at the beginning and end of The Language of God. He grew up in an agnostic family, and knew at an early age that he wanted to be a scientist. At first, he was interested in the physical sciences, since \\"biology was rather like existential philosophy: it just didn't make sense\\" (page 181). However, nearing the end of a Ph.D. program, Collins took a biochemistry course and was hooked. He applied for and was admitted to medical school, from which he graduated and began genetic research and a clinical practice. During one clinic, Collins was asked by a Christian patient about his spiritual beliefs. He did not really have an answer, but determined that he should confirm his atheism by studying the best arguments for faith. A pastor directed him to Mere Christianity by C. S. Lewis, which he cites as the main cause of his conversion. Another section of \\"The Language of God\\" focuses on 'The Moral Law Argument.' Moral Law is very important for Collins: \\"After twenty-eight years as a believer, the Moral Law stands out for me as the strongest signpost of God\\" (p. 218). Moral Law is an argument for the existence of a God. What is the Moral Law? Collins quotes C. S. Lewis, \\"the denunciation of oppression, murder, treachery, falsehood and the injunction of kindness to the aged, the young, and the weak, almsgiving, impartiality, and honesty.\\" Collins has two main arguments: one is that all cultures and religions of the world endorse a universal, absolute and timeless Moral Law. It is overwhelmingly documented in the \\"Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics.\\" According to Collins, it is a unique property that separates humans and animals. The Moral Law includes altruism which is more than just reciprocity (\\"You scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours\\"). His second argument is: \\"Selfless altruism presents a major challenge for the evolutionist\\" (p. 27). Collins argues that science and faith can be compatible. In an interview on the Point of Inquiry podcast he told D. J. Grothe that ‚Äúthe scientific method and the scientific worldview can't be allowed to get distorted by religious perspectives‚Äù, but he does not think ‚Äúbeing a believer or a non-believer affects one's ability to do science‚Äù. He also said that \\"the faith Dawkins describes in the God Delusion isn't the faith I recognise\\", and that, like him, \\"most people are seeking a possible harmony between these worldviews [faith and science]\\" Reception The July 17 Publishers Weekly review reads: ‚ÄúThis marvelous book combines a personal account of Collins‚Äôs faith and experiences as a genetics researcher with discussions of more general topics of science and spirituality, especially centering around evolution.‚Äù Robert K. Eberle summarizes his opinion of the book: \\"The Language of God is well written, and in many places quite thoughtful, but unless one is predisposed to the idea of theistic evolution, most will probably find the book unconvincing on this front.\\" Sam Harris saw Collins's waterfall experience (three frozen streams reminding him of the Trinity) as no more valid than would be a reminder to him (Harris) of the three mythical founders of Rome, argued that Collins's treatment of the evolution of altruism should have considered kin selection and exaptation, and challenged Collins's theodicy by arguing that rationalists should ask whether evidence suggests the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God rather than whether it is compatible with it. In contrast to Harris' criticisms, physicist Stephen M. Barr for First Things writes that Collins' book is meant to be \\"the story of how and why he came to believe in God...There are many conversion stories and many scientific autobiographies, but few books in which prominent scientists tell how they came to faith.\\" Barr concludes that while \\"so many people on both sides are trying to foment a conflict between science and religion, Collins is a sorely needed voice of reason. His book may do more to promote better understanding between the worlds of faith and science than any other so far written.\\" ReferencesExternal links * The BioLogos Foundation * The Language of God on BioLogos.org * Decoding the Language of God: Can a Scientist Really Be a Believer? * An extended, chapter-by-chapter review by atheist B.J.

In other words, this would prevent us from recording TV shows or movies that are played from the TV. This scheme will also be built into new media which will replace the non-DRM encoded DVD+R discs. However, there are some problems that arise with this new system. These discs and DVD players will cost more than the non-DRM encoded ones. People will not want to buy this new system because it costs more than the universal systems that work with all players and with all forms of DVDs. Another problem with this new DRM system is that this format is no longer compatible with all DVD players and disc readers. This caused more trouble because users needed to own the specific reader in order to play the disc. This scheme was usurped by the emergence of buying movies online. Thus far, this scheme has not been implemented. If it was implemented then it would not be able to become a universal technology that everyone can use.

Biography He initially trained with Scarsellino in Ferrara, then spent some time in Bologna, where he was first a pupil of Ippolito Scarsellino, and then may have worked under Reni. After the death of his father, he returned to Ferrara. He is described as prone to carrying a sword, hunting, and brawls. He was so quarrelsome and turbulent a disposition that he passed the greater portion of his life in exile or in disgrace. After injuring a soldier, Cattaneo was forced to seek refuge to a monastery (San Francesco) where he was employed, in painting frescoes. One source says he excelled in painting scenes of soldiers and ruffians in combat. In 1654, he traveled briefly to Rome in the patronage of Cardinal Carlo Pio di Savoia (1622-1689). Among his works are paintings of the passion, an Ecce Homo and a Flagellation (1624), in the lateral altar of the chapel of the Crucifix of the church of San Giorgio, Ferrara, painted after an earthquake afflicted the town. He painted a St. Matthew destroys the idols for the church of Santo Spirito; a Prayer in the garden of Gesthemane for the chorus of the church of San Benedetto; a St. Louis rejecting the Ducal crown initially for the Gesu, later in the church San Stefano. He painted an Annunciation for the church of Santo Spirito and Christ praying on the Mount for the church of San Benedetto.

It documents national response capability and is intended to promote overall coordination among the hierarchy of responders and contingency plans.National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan Overview, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Accessed November 19, 2009. The first National Contingency Plan was developed and published in 1968, in response to a massive oil spill from the oil tanker Torrey Canyon, off the coast of England a year earlier. More than 37 million gallons of crude oil spilled into the water and caused massive environmental damage. To avoid the problems faced by response officials involved in the incident, US officials developed a coordinated approach to cope with potential spills in US waters. The 1968 plan provided the first comprehensive system of accident reporting, spill containment, and cleanup. It also established a response headquarters, a national reaction team, and regional reaction teams (precursors to the current National Response Team and Regional Response Teams). Congress has broadened the scope of the National Contingency Plan over the years. As required by the Clean Water Act of 1972, the NCP was revised the following year to include a framework for responding to hazardous substance spills and oil discharges. Following the passage of Superfund legislation in 1980, the NCP was broadened to cover releases at hazardous waste sites requiring emergency removal actions. Over the years, additional revisions have been made to the NCP to keep pace with the enactment of legislation. The latest revisions to the NCP were finalized in 1994 to reflect the oil spill provisions of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Under the National Contingency Plan, federal agencies should plan for emergencies and develop procedures for addressing oil discharges and releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants; coordinate their planning, preparedness, and response activities with one another coordinate their planning, preparedness, and response activities with affected states, local governments, and private entities; and make available those facilities or resources that may be useful in a response situation, consistent with agency authorities and capabilities.40 CFR 300.105(a) Once a response has been triggered, the USCG or USEPA \\"is authorized to initiate and, in the case of a discharge posing a substantial threat to public health or welfare of the United States is required to initiate and direct, appropriate response activities when the Administrator or Secretary determines that any oil or CWA hazardous substance is discharged or there is a substantial threat of such discharge from any vessel or offshore or onshore facility into or on the navigable waters of the United States, on the adjoining shorelines to the navigable waters, into or on the waters of the exclusive economic zone, or that may affect natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, or under exclusive management authority of the United States.\\"40 CFR 300.125(b) The federal On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) \\"directs response efforts and coordinates all other efforts at the scene of a discharge or release.\\"40 CFR 300.120(a) Major revisions * 1968 Initial plan * 1973 Added provisions for hazardous substances * 1980 (circa) revised to reflect CERCLA provisions * 1990 Revised and reorganized to reflect SARA provisions55 FR 8666, May 8, 1990 * 1994 Revised to reflect OPA revisions59 FR 47384, September 15, 1994 Role in BP oil spill The plan places responsibility for command and control in managing serious disaster response with the US federal government and not a private company like BP, according to a 2010 article in Rolling Stone (magazine) about the BP Gulf oil spill.Tim Dickinson The Spill, The Scandal and the President; The inside story of how Obama failed to crack down on the corruption of the Bush years ‚Äì and let the world's most dangerous oil company get away with murder Rolling Stone June 08, 2010 Key provisions Section 300.110 establishes the National Response Team and its roles and responsibilities in the National Response system, including planning and coordinating responses to major discharges of oil or hazardous waste, providing guidance to Regional Response Teams, co-ordinating a national program of preparedness planning and response, and facilitating research to improve response activities. The EPA serves as the lead agency within the National Response Team (NRT). Section 300.115 establishes the Regional Response Teams and their roles and responsibilities in the National Response System, including, coordinating preparedness, planning, and response at the regional level. The RRT consists of a standing team made up of representatives of each federal agency that is a member of the Net, state and local government representatives, and also an incident-specific team, made up of members of the standing team that is activated for a response. The RRT also provides oversight and consistency review for area plans within a given region. Section 300.120 establishes general responsibilities of federal On-Scene Coordinators. Section 300.125(a) requires notification of any discharge or release to the National Response Center through a toll-free telephone number. The National Response Center (NRC) acts as the central clearinghouse for all pollution incident reporting. Section 300.135(a) authorizes the predesignated On-Scene Coordinator to direct all federal, state, and private response activities at the site of a discharge. Section 300.135(d) establishes the unified command structure for managing responses to discharges through coordinated personnel and resources of the federal government, the state government, and the responsible party. Section 300.165 requires the On-Scene Coordinator to submit to the RRT or the NRT a report on all removal actions taken at a site. Section 300.170 identifies the responsibilities for federal agencies that may be called upon during response planning and implementation to provide assistance in their respective areas of expertise consistent with the agencies' capabilities and authorities. Section 300.175 lists the federal agencies that have duties associated with responding to releases. Section 300.210 defines the objectives, authority, and scope of Federal Contingency Plans, including the National Contingency Plan (NCP), Regional Contingency Plans (RCPs), and Area Contingency Plans (ACPs). Section 300.317 establishes national priorities for responding to a release. Section 300.320 establishes the general pattern of response to be executed by the On-Scene Coordinator (OSC), including determination of threat, classification of the size and type of the release, notification of the RRT and the NRC, and supervision of thorough removal actions. Section 300.322 authorizes the OSC to determine whether a release poses a substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the United States based on several factors, including the size and character of the discharge and its proximity to human populations and sensitive environments. In such cases, the OSC is authorized to direct all federal, state, or private response and recovery actions. The OSC may enlist the support of other federal agencies or special teams. Section 300.323 provides special consideration to discharges which have been classified as a spill of national significance. In such cases, senior federal officials direct nationally-coordinated response efforts. Section 300.324 requires the OSC to notify the National Strike Force Coordination Center (NSFCC) in the event of worst case discharges, defined as the largest foreseeable discharge in adverse weather conditions. The NSFCC coordinates the acquisition of needed response personnel and equipment. The OSC also must require implementation of the worst case portion of the tank vessel and Facility Response Plans and the Area Contingency Plan. Section 300.355 provides funding for responses to oil releases under the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, provided certain criteria are met. The responsible party is liable for federal removal costs and damages as detailed in section 1002 of the Oil Pollution Act (OPA). Federal agencies assisting in a response action may be reimbursed. Several other federal agencies may provide financial support for removal actions. Subpart J establishes the NCP Product Schedule, which contains dispersants and other chemical or biological products that may be used in carrying out the NCP. Authorization for the use of these products is conducted by Regional Response Teams and Area Committees or by the OSC, in consultation with EPA representatives. Section 300.415(b) authorizes the lead agency to initiate appropriate removal action in the event of a hazardous substance release. Decisions of action will be based on threats to human or animal populations, contamination of drinking water supplies or sensitive ecosystems, high levels of hazardous substances in soils, weather conditions that may cause migration or release of hazardous substances, the threat of fire or explosion, or other significant factors affecting the health or welfare or the public or the environment. Section 300.415(c) authorizes the OSC to direct appropriate actions to mitigate or remove the release of hazardous substances. .

Ott chose the name knowing that the domain name would be available because no one else would know the word. Ott, a former journalist, started Scrappleface in July 2002.

She was raised in the Caucasus, where she lived between 1862 and 1878 with her family. In 1879 she married Friedrich Franz III of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, who in 1883 became the reigning Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. The couple had three children, but her husband was plagued by ill health and they spent most of the year living abroad. The Grand Duchess never became used to her new country where she was unpopular. After the death of her husband in 1897, her visits to Schwerin were sparse. A strong-willed, independent and unconventional woman, she caused a royal scandal when in 1902 she had a child fathered by her personal secretary.

She was only two years-old when her father was appointed Viceroy of the Caucasus in December 1862 and the family moved to Georgia.Zeepvat, The Other Anastasia, p. 1 Anastasia Mikhailovna grew up in her father's palace in Tiflis amidst the wild and austere atmosphere of the Caucasus. The family lived in a huge palace and also owned a rural estate near Borjomi, a summer residence, the Mikhailovskoe, near Saint Petersburg, and a residence on the Black Sea.Mateos Sainz de Medrano, Ricardo, A Child of The Caucasus, p. 12. Known in the family as \\"Stassie\\", Anastasia Mikhailovna was the only daughter among seven children. She was the object of devotion not only as her father's favorite, but was spoiled by her six brothers. Her father was occupied with his militaristic and governmental activities, while her mother, a strict disciplinarian, showed little affection and raised the children with an iron hand.Alexander, Grand Duke of Russia, Once a Grand Duke, p. 21 Anastasia's brothers found in her an outlet for love and tenderness that was so lacking in their parents. She was raised separately from her brothers most of the time, joining them only on Sundays when they were all allowed to take a walk together. She was particularly close to her eldest brother, Nicholas Michailovich, with whom she shared artistic interest. She grew up to be very independent, intelligent and strong-willed, with a warm and happy personality. Tall and slim, she had dark hair and green oriental eyes.Beeche, Arturo,The Grand Duchesses, p. 73. Her education centered in languages; she learned French, German, and English besides her native Russian.Beeche, Arturo, The Grand Duchesses, p. 74. Marriage Engagement picture of Grand Duchess Anastasia and Friedrich Franz III of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, 1878 In 1878, when Anastasia was not yet eighteen, her mother and Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, wife of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, arranged her marriage with Maria's eldest brother, Friedrich Franz, Hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He was 27 years old and heir to the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in northern Germany. Their grandmothers, Princesses Alexandrine and Charlotte of Prussia, were sisters, and Friedrich Franz was also a direct descendant of Tsar Paul I of Russia. In the spring of 1878, while Anastasia was visiting St Petersburg with her mother, Prince Friedrich Franz, who was staying with his sister at the Vladimir Palace, asked her hand.Zeepvat, The Other Anastasia, p. 2 He was rich, the heir of a German Grand Duchy and good-hearted, but had delicate health, suffered from asthma, a rash, and a weak heart. The engagement was resented by Anastasia's brothers, who did not want to be separated from her. Anastasia herself was not happy with her fianc√©, appalled by his skin condition. He used to get periodic attacks of eczema on the face and body, which confined him into complete seclusion for long periods. As was often the case with dynastic marriages, she was given no choice by her parents, who wanted to secure a good position for her.Mateos Saintz de Medrano, Ricardo, A Child of The Caucasus, p. 13. The betrothal was announced on 4 May. In the following days Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna described Anastasia in a letter to her future father in law: \\"She is enchantingly dear in both her character and her appearance. I do not doubt for a moment that she will fill her place and her new position to perfection now, and will be equal to the future. In her movements, her carriage and her speech she will remind you of Queen Olly though she has big, clear expressive eyes, that promise much. To the outward appearance, her figure is still very slim and childlike, but when she speak this impression is wholly dispelled. She is very well educated and carefully raised\\".Zeepvat, The Other Anastasia, p. 3 In October, Anastasia and her family traveled to Saint Petersburg to prepare for the wedding. The marriage took place on in the Winter Palace, and she was given away by her uncle, Tsar Alexander II; there was first an Orthodox ceremony, and then a Protestant service.Beeche, Arturo, The Grand Duchesses, p. 75. The wedding was a grand affair, and representatives of all the ruling houses of Europe attended.Beeche, Arturo, The Grand Duchesses, p. 75. Schwerin On 8 February 1879, Anastasia and Friedrich arrived in Schwerin.Beeche, Arturo, The Grand Duchesses, p. 75. Her father-in-law Friedrich Franz II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin was the reigning monarch of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and presided over a large family. The young couple settled in the Marienpalais, but Anastasia was not allowed to arrange her apartments according to her own taste. She was homesick and found a strict and old-fashioned court and an oppressive atmosphere. Although her own mother was German, Anastasia Mikhailovna never overcame her dislike for her adopted country. The couple made brief visits to Baden-Baden and Berlin. Anastasia was soon pregnant and her eldest child, Alexandrine, was born in December on the first year of her marriage. Shortly after, her husband's ill health forced them to travel to a warmer climate. In March 1880, Anastasia made her first visit to Russia since her marriage. A year later, she returned to St. Petersburg for the funeral of her uncle Alexander II. While there, her husband suffered one of his asthma attacks. His frail health allowed Anastasia the perfect excuse to spend as little time as possible in Schwerin. She traveled frequently visiting her family in Russia and spending long sojourns abroad, looking for a warm climate for her husband's ailments, in southern Italy and France. They were living in Palermo, when in April 1882 a second child, Friederich Franz, was born. Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Anastasia and her husband were in Palermo at the death of her father-in-law on 15 April 1883. Friedrich Franz was too ill to attend his father's funeral. As soon as he recovered, he and Anastasia returned to Schwerin with their children. Her husband ascended to the throne as Grand Duke Friedrich Franz III of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. At first, Anastasia enjoyed her new position as the wife of the reigning Grand Duke and took residence in sumptuous apartments in Schwerin Castle.Beeche, Arturo, The Grand Duchesses, p. 76. However, soon after she wanted to return to Italy or France. The population of Mecklenburg-Schwerin did not want their sovereign living somewhere else, and Anastasia was heavily criticized. A compromise was reached, and the Grand Duke and his wife would live in Schwerin for five months and could stay wherever they wanted for the rest of the year, on the condition that their children were to be born in Schwerin. Their youngest daughter, Cecile, was born in Schwerin in 1886. While in their Grand Duchy, Anastasia Mikhailovna spent as little time as possible in Schwerin Castle in the summer, preferring her residence in Gelbensande, a hunting lodge built in 1886 in the style of an English cottage near Rostock and the Baltic Sea.Zeepvat, The Other Anastasia, p. 5 There, the couple led the simple life they preferred. Friederich Franz spent most his time hunting, while Anastasia and the children rode or drove out, visited local people or enjoyed the beach and the surrounding forest.Zeepvat, The Other Anastasia, p. 5 The grand duchess regularly celebrated her birthdays at Gelbensande and her father and brothers often came for the hunting. In the winters the family moved to Cannes, where they celebrated Christmas.Zeepvat, The Other Anastasia, p. 5 Between 1887 and 1889, her husband had constructed for her the Villa Wenden, a large Italian-style palace situated on the side of a mountain that dominated the bay of Cannes. They lived there every year from November until May, stopping in Paris on their way back to Germany. Grand Duchess Anastasia brought up her children with simplicity and more freedom than she received from her parents, and would keep a close relationship with them. She spoke French to her husband and English with her children.Beeche, Arturo, The Grand Duchesses, p. 77. She was a keen tennis player, with her own tennis court at the Villa Wenden. She loved Italian music, particularly the operas of Puccini, and the theater. Her extant letters reveal a warm, caring person, who always seems to have been happy about life.Cockfield H, James, White Crow, p. 16. She frequented the homes of many other European royals who stayed on the Riviera; her parents and brothers were also frequent visitors. Her mother died of a heart attack in 1891, and Anastasia remained very close to her widower father and her brothers, particularly the two eldest, Nicholas and Michael. Anastasia spent lavishly from the Grand Duke's income and her own dowry, for which she was widely criticized, but she loved to shock people who condemned her. She liked society and became a frequent visitor to the gambling tables of Monte Carlo, losing a large sum of money at the casino; but in spite of her extravagances, she never lost her husband's affection.Mateos Sainz de Medrano, Ricardo, A Child of The Caucasus, p. 14. Dowager Grand Duchess Grand Duchess Anastasia had a turbuent life leaving a legacy of scandal on the French Riviera, where she spent the long years of her widowhood. In the winter of 1896 ‚Äì 1897, the health of Grand Duke Friedrich Franz deteriorated. In the spring, Anastasia took her husband to Grasse in the hope that the change of location might initiate a recovery. It was during this time that their eldest daughter, Alexandrine, was engaged to the son of the Danish Crown Prince, who later became King Christian X of Denmark. A few weeks later, at the beginning of April, Anastasia returned with her husband to Villa Wenden. Anticipating the worst, she sent for their son, who was studying in Dresden. On April 10, while the family and household were at dinner, a coachman found Grand Duke Friedrich Franz unconscious at the bottom of the villa's -high retaining wall on the road below the rose-festooned parapet, which encircled the villa's garden. He had jumped in an attempt to end his life.Cockfield, White Crow, p. 105 He was carried back to the villa, where he finally died.Beeche, Arturo, The Grand Duchesses, p. 78. The official report was that the sick grand duke, gasping for air, had gone to the balcony falling down over the railing accidentally. The Grand Duchess and her two elder children took the body back to Mecklenburg for the funeral. She was resented by her in-laws and was so unpopular in Schwerin that she was suspected of killing him. Anastasia seemed to have mourned her husband sincerely, telling her lady in waiting, \\"I have lost my best friend.\\"Domin, Marie-Agnes, Anastasia Mikailovna Romanova, p. 57. At her husband's death Anastasia inherited all his private property; the Villa Wenden and Gelbensande, even though this palace should have been passed to her 15-year-old son, who became Friedrich Franz IV under the regency of his uncle Duke Johann Albrecht until 1901 when he came of age. Once the mourning period passed, in July 1897, Anastasia took her eldest daughter, Alexandrine, to Denmark to meet the Danish Crown Prince's family in private. On her insistence, the wedding, on 26 April 1898, took place neither in Schwerin nor in Denmark, but in the Villa Wenden in Cannes.Zeepvat, The Other Anastasia, p. 6 Royal scandal Anastasia dowager grand duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Grand Duchess Anastasia was only thirty-six years-old when she became a widow. From then on, she rarely visited Schwerin, always staying at Gelbensande. She preferred to live on the Riviera or to travel to Saint Petersburg, Paris, or England. While remaining very attached to her family, her thirst for living, strong personality, and spirit of independence caused a lot of talk. The grand duchess kept a small apartment in Paris, where she led the life of the rich and beautiful, going to parties, looking wildly for distractions. She also gambled heavily at Monte Carlo. Fascinated by her, the croupiers would roll the ball intentionally into her favorite section of the roulette wheel, to increase her chances of winning. To her many hobbies, she added motoring and clay pigeon shooting. Zeepvat, The Other Anastasia, p. 6 Anastasia started an affair with her personal secretary, Vladimir Alexandrovitch Paltov, and became pregnant by her lover. At first she pretended that her swelling was the result of a tumor. When the time came to deliver, she claimed she had contracted chicken pox for which she had to be quarantined. Her illegitimate son, Alexis Louis de Wenden, was born in Nice on 23 December 1902.Beeche, Arturo, The Grand Duchesses, p. 79. The name de Wenden was granted by King Christian IX of Denmark after Anastasia's villa. She did bring up her illegitimate son herself. When later he was sent to study in a boarding school in Normandy, she wrote to him every day. Grand Duchess Anastasia, although close to her son, Friedrich Franz IV, found him willful and humorless. She encouraged him to marry young. On June 7 1903, he married Princess Alexandra of Hanover. Anastasia was very unpopular in Germany, due to her French sympathies. Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany particularly disliked her, but Cecile, her youngest daughter, attracted the attention of Wilhelm's eldest son, Wilhelm, German Crown Prince, during Friedrich Franz IV's wedding celebrations. They were married on 6 June 1905. Anastasia was allowed to come to the court of Berlin only twice, first for the wedding and later when the first son of this marriage was born. She was advised never to live near her daughter.Beeche, Arturo, The Grand Duchesses, p. 80. Anastasia's father Grand Duke Michael Nicolaievich of Russia had a stroke years earlier, and moved to live near her in the South of France. Upon his death in 1909, she inherited immense wealth. In the first decade of the 20th century, the Grand Duchess occupied herself by visiting her relatives, her children, and her growing number of grandchildren, and with her hobbies: reading, going to parties, and the gambling tables in nearby Monte Carlo. Always the eccentric, she was described by one contemporary as ‚Äúcompletely indifferent to anything but her own desires‚Äù.Cockfield, White Crow, p. 17 Prince Felix Yussupov, who married her niece, Princess Irina of Russia, met Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikahilovna in Paris in 1913, describing her in his memoirs: > ‚ÄúAlthough she was well over forty, she had lost none of her high spirits; > she was kind and affectionate, but her eccentric and despotic nature made > her rather formidable. When she heard that I was going to marry her niece, > she took me in hand. From that day my life was no longer my own. She was an > early riser and she used to telephone me at eight in the morning. Sometimes > she came to the Hotel du Rhin, where I was staying, and sat reading the > papers in my room while I dressed.

The diplomat Maurice Pal√©ologue wrote on 14 October 1913, \\"Although she is fifty-three, she lives openly with an Argentinian blackguard, dances at Magic City with all comers till two in the morning and associates with the scum of the aerodromes.\\"Painter, George D., Proust: The Later Years, p. 210, n. 1. Last years From left to right : Alexandrine with her son Prince Knud of Denmark; Christian X of Denmark; Grand Duchess Anastasia with her grandson Frederick on her lap; Cecile and Friedrich Franz IV, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. In the summer of 1914, just before World War I broke out, Grand Duchess Anastasia visited her brother, Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich of Russia, and his family in England. When many eagerly greeted the outbreak of war, after the Austrian ultimatum, she wrote to Tsar Nicholas II: \\"I hope that the war will not happen and that we even can say ‚Äòperhaps in a few days, we‚Äôll all be together again'\\". The conflict split her family. Her son was a reigning prince in Germany and her younger daughter was the Kaiser's daughter in law. On the opposite side, her brothers in Russia were fighting to defeat the Central Powers. Anastasia sided with her native country.Zeepvat, The Other Anastasia, p. 7 Technically a German princess, the grand duchess could neither remain in France, a country at war with Germany, nor could she return to Schwerin, now an enemy of her native Russia. Therefore, she decided to settle in neutral Switzerland. She spent the war years living at the Savoy Hotel in Lausanne, giving her villa in Cannes for use as a hospital for wounded officers of the Russian Expeditionary Force in France. During the war, she managed to obtain news of her daughter Cecile and her son, Friedrich Franz, through her daughter, Alexandrine, Queen in neutral Denmark. The Bolsheviks killed three of her brothers, Grand Dukes Nicholas, George and Serge, during the Russian Revolution. The fall of the German monarchy after the war resulted in the loss of the crown for both her son in Schwerin, and her daughter Cecile in Germany. After the end of the war, Grand Duchess Anastasia decided to go back to France; she could not return as a German Princess, and with her Russian passport, she sneaked inside the country with the entourage of her cousin, Princess Catherine Yourievskaya, who was a refugee in Lausanne and was heading toward Nice. Once in France, Grand Duchess Anastasia created a charitable foundation to help Russian exiles who had emigrated to France, with Valdimir Paltov as its president.Zeepvat, The Other Anastasia, p. 8 She settled at Villa Fantasia at Eze, near Cannes. There she spent her last years, taking up her old social life.Beeche, Arturo, The Grand Duchesses, p. 82. In the first week of March 1922, shortly after attending a party given by her nephew, Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich in Cap-d'Ail, Grand Duchess Anastasia fell ill. She suffered a stroke and died on 11 March 1922 in √àze. She was 61 years old. The Baroness de Stoeckl, who had known her well, commented, \\" And so passed on the last great character of the Romanoff dynasty. First, she was always an Imperial highness who knew how to carry her rank but, not least, a woman who loved and who lived\\".Zeepvat, The Other Anastasia, p. 8 With the death of the grand Duchess, her children were reunited for the first time since 1914. Her natural son, Alexis Louis de Wenden, remained in France.Mateos Saintz de Medrano, Ricardo, A Child of The Caucasus, p. 15. She was buried beside her husband in Ludwigslust. Among her direct descendants are Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and Prince George Frederick of Prussia, head of the House of Hohenzollern. The male line of the House of Mecklenburg-Schwerin died out with her grandson, Hereditary Grand Duke Friedrich Franz, in 2001.

The name comes from hare (sunny weather) and card, meaning the card for Okayama, the sunny city. Just like JR East's Suica or JR West's ICOCA, the card uses RFID technology developed by Sony corporation known as FeliCa. As of October 2006, the card is usable for all the tramway lines by Okayama Electric Tramway, as well as 55 bus lines by the three operators for Okayama, Kurashiki, and Tamano. Within autumn, 2007, the card will be usable for all the bus lines by the operators. There also is a plan to introduce the card to other bus operators in Okayama. At the same time Hareca was introduced, the three operators also introduced PiTaPa, meaning the latter card is also usable in those lines.

He previously served as Yale's Provost, Dean of Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and Dean of Yale College. Salovey is one of the early pioneers and leading researchers in emotional intelligence. Early life Salovey was born in 1958 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He is the oldest child of Elaine Salovey, who was a registered nurse, and Ronald Salovey, who was a physical chemist and Professor of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science at the University of Southern California. His grandparents' families originally came from Poland and Russia, his paternal grandfather came by way of Jerusalem. His paternal grandfather, Yitzchak Leib was born in Jerusalem in 1895 to a community worker and pharmacist named Zalman Yoseph Soloveitchik (b. 1874). Zalman Yoseph was the son of Simchah (c. 1830-1921), a Lithuanian born Jew who emigrated to Jerusalem where he was called \\"The Londoner\\" due to the time he spent living in London. Simcha was the son of Eliyahu Soloveitchik, an uncle to the famous scholar Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik. Salovey spent his early years in northern New Jersey and attended high school at Williamsville North High School in a suburb of Buffalo, New York before moving to suburban Los Angeles in 1975, when his father was appointed a professor at the University of Southern California. In 1976, he graduated co-valedictorian from Rolling Hills High School in Rolling Hills Estates, California, California. He attended Stanford University, where he received a B.A. in psychology and an M.A. in sociology with departmental honors and university distinction. While at Stanford, he served as a peer counselor with The Bridge Peer Counseling Center, a field about which he later co-authored a seminal textbook. Academic biography After graduating from Stanford, Salovey moved to New Haven, Connecticut to pursue a Ph.D. in psychology at Yale under the guidance of Judith Rodin. After completing a dissertation entitled \\"The Effects of Mood and Focus of Attention on Self-Relevant Thoughts and Helping Intention,\\" he graduated from Yale in 1986 and joined the Yale Department of Psychology as an assistant professor. He was appointed full professor in 1995 and now has secondary faculty appointments in Yale's School of Management, School of Public Health and the Institution for Social and Policy Studies. He is currently the Chris Argyris Professor of Psychology. Salovey's most significant research contributions are in the field of emotional intelligence. With John D. Mayer he significantly expanded the scope of the concept and authored several of the field's seminal papers, arguing that people have widely ranging abilities pertaining to emotional control, reasoning, and perceptivity.Although Salovey and Mayer are frequently credited with the term's origination, they attribute it to earlier researchers such as Wayne Payne. Against earlier theories of intelligence that conceived of emotion as rival to reasoning, Salovey and Mayer contended that emotion could motivate productive outcomes when properly directed. Subsequently, he has worked to develop models and tests of emotional intelligence, such as the Mayer-Salovey- Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test. Salovey's second vein of research is in health psychology, where he has applied social psychology principles to investigate the efficacy of health messaging in promoting HIV risk reduction, early cancer detection, and smoking cessation. In all, Salovey has authored or edited thirteen books translated into eleven languages and published more than 350 journal articles and essays. Outside Yale, Salovey has served on the National Science Foundation's Social Psychology Advisory Panel, the National Institute of Mental Health Behavioral Science Working Group, and the NIMH National Advisory Mental Health Council. Salovey served as President of the Society for General Psychology and Treasurer of the International Society for Research on Emotion. He was the founding editor of the Review of General Psychology and an associate editor of Emotion and Psychological Bulletin. Administrative career Having serving in various administrative roles within the Department of Psychology for a decade, Salovey was appointed Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in January 2003. The following year he replaced Richard Brodhead as Dean of Yale College. In October 2008, he succeeded Andrew Hamilton as Provost of Yale University. As Provost, Salovey oversaw major budget reductions caused by the 2008 recession, expansion of Yale's West Campus, the formation of Yale‚ÄìNUS College, reform of tenure policies for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and an overhaul of sexual misconduct grievance procedures. Speculation that Salovey was being considered for the Yale presidency began nearly four years before President Rick Levin's August 2012 retirement announcement. After a nationwide search in which Salovey was widely considered to be the frontrunner, the Yale Corporation announced his selection as Yale's 23rd president in November 2012. Salovey took office on July 1, 2013. Salovey is the first Yale president since 1986 to live in the President's House, the formal residence of the university president. After a renovation, Salovey moved into the residence in the fall of 2014.http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/03/28/presidents-house-renovations- spark-controversy/ Honors In recognition of his research contributions, Salovey has received the National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award, the National Cancer Institute CIS Partner in Research Award, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration Excellence Award. He has received two awards for excellence in teaching at Yale, the William Clyde Devane Medal and the Lex Hixon '63 Prize for Teaching Excellence in the Social Sciences. Other honors include honorary degrees from the University of Pretoria, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Harvard University, McGill University, National Tsing Hua University, University of Haifa, and Vytautas Magnus University, as well as membership in the National Academy of Medicine and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Personal life As a freshman at Stanford, Salovey began listening to bluegrass music and learned to play banjo. In 1990, he founded the Professors of Bluegrass with Kelly Brownell, in which he plays bass. The band has a rotating membership of Yale faculty, students, and residents of New Haven and released its first album, \\"Pick or Perish,\\" in June 2013. He also serves as a trustee of the International Bluegrass Music Museum and on the advisory board of the Connecticut Folk Festival. Salovey is married to Marta Elisa Moret, a 1984 graduate of the Yale School of Public Health and the president of Urban Policy Strategies, LLC. They met as students at Yale and married in 1986 in Orange, Connecticut.Connecticut, Marriage Index, 1959-2001 The Saloveys are descendants of the Soloveitchik rabbinic family. Salovey's brother, Todd, is the associate artistic director of the San Diego Repertory Theatre and on the theater and dance faculty at the University of California, San Diego.

A company limited by guarantee does not usually have a share capital or shareholders, but instead has members who act as guarantors of the company's liabilities: each member undertakes to contribute an amount specified in the articles (typically very small) in the event of insolvency or of the winding up of the company.companylawclub.co.uk, Retrieved 23 March 2014 A company limited by guarantee can distribute its profits to its members, if allowed to by its articles of association, but then it would not be eligible for charitable status. Like a private company limited by shares, a company limited by guarantee must include the suffix \\"Limited\\" in its name, except in circumstances specifically excluded by law. One condition of this exclusion is that the company does not distribute profits. Until 1981, it was possible in the United Kingdom to form a company limited by guarantee with share capital. Under section 5 of the Companies Act 2006, new companies cannot be formed as a company limited by guarantee with a share capital. Uses When incorporating multi-stakeholder organisations, this form is sometimes preferred over the industrial and provident society because company law allows multiple classes of member with separate voting constituencies. Common uses of companies limited by guarantee include clubs, membership organisations, including students' unions, residential property management companies, sports associations (such as the PGA European Tour), workers' co-operatives, other social enterprises, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and charities (such as Oxfam), and at least one political party (the UK Independence PartyUK Independence Party: constitution and Companies House registry entry).

Like the play, the film depicts two minor characters from William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who find themselves on the road to Elsinore Castle at the behest of the King of Denmark. They encounter a band of players before arriving to find that they are needed to try to discern what troubles the prince Hamlet. Meanwhile, they ponder the meaning of their existence. Filmed in Trogir, Croatia, the movie won the Golden Lion at the 47th Venice International Film Festival. The film stars Gary Oldman as Rosencrantz and Tim Roth as Guildenstern,\\"Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead\\", Roger Ebert, 15 March 1991.BBC, \\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead\\" although a running theme throughout has many characters, themselves included, uncertain as to which is which. It also features Richard Dreyfuss as the leading player, Iain Glen as Hamlet, Ian Richardson as Polonius, Joanna Miles as Gertrude, and Donald Sumpter as King Claudius. This was Stoppard's first and, to date, only film as a director. Plot The film, like the play, focuses on Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and their actions (or lack thereof) within the play of Hamlet. The film begins as they travel on horseback to Elsinore, contemplating fate, memory and language. Rosencrantz finds and continually flips a coin which always comes up heads, causing Guildenstern to conclude that something is wrong with reality. They meet a travelling troupe of tragedians on the way, and during their conversation with the lead Player, they are mysteriously transported into the action of Hamlet at Elsinore. They wander around the castle, trying to catch up to the action and understand what is going on by listening to other parts of the play. They are asked by the Danish royal couple to stay awhile in order to help find out the cause of, and hopefully cure, Prince Hamlet's gloomy state. They spend their time outside the scenes in Hamlet trying to figure out what is wrong with the prince and what is required of them. The remainder of the play follows the Shakespearean drama whenever the two characters are \\"on stage\\", while the title heroes remain largely occupied with the futile hazards of daily life whenever the \\"main action\\" is elsewhere. Soon the very same theatre troupe arrives to perform at court, as part of the Bard's tragedy. The Player simultaneously castigates them for abandoning their real play on the road, which cannot exist without an audience, and explains some of the plot and logic of conventional rules of plot-staging and -writing. Ultimately, they are sent to England and outside the action of the play again. The final part takes place on the ship to England, where they read the letter they are to deliver with Hamlet ‚Äì discovering that it is an order for his death. They decide to pretend they never saw it. Hamlet replaces the letter, and (as described in Shakespeare's play) escapes on an attacking pirate ship. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern worry about what they are to do now that Hamlet is gone, unaware that Hamlet has altered the letter so that it calls for their deaths rather than his own. The Player finishes the action by reading the letter that sentences them to death. Guildenstern, still trying to struggle against destiny, stabs The Player with the other man's dagger, only to find that the weapon is a theatrical prop. Scenes of the deaths of Ophelia, Laertes, Gertrude, Claudius and Hamlet are shown, and both Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, finally accepting their fate, are hanged. The film ends with the tragedians packing up their cart and continuing on their way. Cast Daniel Day-Lewis was to be cast as Guildenstern, but abruptly halted his acting career due to stress. He was replaced by Roth, who had also been in contention for the role. Reception Critical reaction for the film tended towards the positive, with an overall rating of 60% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews.Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes A common criticism in negative reviews was that the material is more suited to the stage than to the screen; examples include Vincent Canby's review, in which he says, \\"[Stoppard] delights in sounds and meanings, in puns, in flights of words that soar and swoop as if in visual display. On the stage, this sort of thing can be great fun ... In the more realistic medium of film, so many words can numb the eardrums and weigh upon the eyelids like old coins. This is the effect of 'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead'.\\" Similarly, Roger Ebert states that \\"the problem is that this material was never meant to be a film, and can hardly work as a film.\\" The film won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival as well as the Fantasporto Directors' Week Award. For his work in the film, Oldman was nominated for the 1991 Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead. Home media The film was released on DVD in the UK in 2003, and in the US in 2005, featuring interviews with Oldman, Roth, Dreyfuss, and Stoppard.

They are also used to describe the small-signal (linearized) response of non-linear networks. They are members of a family of similar parameters used in electronic engineering, other examples being: S-parameters, Y-parameters,David M. Pozar, 2005 (op. cit); pp 170-174. H-parameters, T-parameters or ABCD-parameters.David M. Pozar, 2005 (op. cit); pp 183-186.A.H. Morton, Advanced Electrical Engineering, Pitman Publishing Ltd., 1985; pp 33-72, . Z-parameters are also known as open-circuit impedance parameters as they are calculated under open circuit conditions. i.e., Ix=0, where x=1,2 refer to input and output currents flowing through the ports (of a two-port network in this case) respectively. The Z-parameter matrix A Z-parameter matrix describes the behaviour of any linear electrical network that can be regarded as a black box with a number of ports. A port in this context is a pair of electrical terminals carrying equal and opposite currents into and out-of the network, and having a particular voltage between them. The Z-matrix gives no information about the behaviour of the network when the currents at any port are not balanced in this way (should this be possible), nor does it give any information about the voltage between terminals not belonging to the same port. Typically, it is intended that each external connection to the network is between the terminals of just one port, so that these limitations are appropriate. For a generic multi-port network definition, it is assumed that each of the ports is allocated an integer n ranging from 1 to N, where N is the total number of ports. For port n, the associated Z-parameter definition is in terms of the port current and port voltage, I_n\\\\, and V_n\\\\, respectively. For all ports the voltages may be defined in terms of the Z-parameter matrix and the currents by the following matrix equation: :V = Z I\\\\, where Z is an N √ó N matrix the elements of which can be indexed using conventional matrix notation. In general the elements of the Z-parameter matrix are complex numbers and functions of frequency. For a one-port network, the Z-matrix reduces to a single element, being the ordinary impedance measured between the two terminals.The Z-parameters are also known as the open circuit parameters because they are measured or calculated by applying current to one port and determining the resulting voltages at all the ports while the undriven ports are terminated into open circuits. Two-port networks The equivalent circuit for Z-parameters of a two-port network. reciprocal two-port network. The Z-parameter matrix for the two-port network is probably the most common. In this case the relationship between the port currents, port voltages and the Z-parameter matrix is given by: :\\\\begin{pmatrix} V_1 \\\\ V_2\\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} Z_{11} & Z_{12} \\\\ Z_{21} & Z_{22} \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix}I_1 \\\\ I_2\\\\end{pmatrix} . where :Z_{11} = {V_1 \\\\over I_1 } \\\\bigg_{I_2 = 0} \\\\qquad Z_{12} = {V_1 \\\\over I_2 } \\\\bigg_{I_1 = 0} :Z_{21} = {V_2 \\\\over I_1 } \\\\bigg_{I_2 = 0} \\\\qquad Z_{22} = {V_2 \\\\over I_2 } \\\\bigg_{I_1 = 0} For the general case of an N-port network, :Z_{nm} = {V_n \\\\over I_m } \\\\bigg_{I_k = 0 \\\\text{ for } k e m} Impedance relations The input impedance of a two-port network is given by: :Z_\\\\text{in} = Z_{11} - \\\\frac{Z_{12}Z_{21}}{Z_{22}+Z_L} where ZL is the impedance of the load connected to port two. Similarly, the output impedance is given by: :Z_\\\\text{out} = Z_{22} - \\\\frac{Z_{12}Z_{21}}{Z_{11}+Z_S} where ZS is the impedance of the source connected to port one. Relation to S-parameters The Z-parameters of a network are related to its S-parameters by : \\\\begin{align} Z &= \\\\sqrt{z} (1_{!N} + S) (1_{!N} - S)^{-1} \\\\sqrt{z} \\\\ &= \\\\sqrt{z} (1_{!N} - S)^{-1} (1_{!N} + S) \\\\sqrt{z} \\\\ \\\\end{align} and : \\\\begin{align} S &= (\\\\sqrt{y}Z\\\\sqrt{y} \\\\,- 1_{!N}) (\\\\sqrt{y}Z\\\\sqrt{y} \\\\,+ 1_{!N})^{-1} \\\\ &= (\\\\sqrt{y}Z\\\\sqrt{y} \\\\,+ 1_{!N})^{-1} (\\\\sqrt{y}Z\\\\sqrt{y} \\\\,- 1_{!N}) \\\\ \\\\end{align} where 1_{!N} is the identity matrix, \\\\sqrt{z} is a diagonal matrix having the square root of the characteristic impedance at each port as its non-zero elements, \\\\sqrt{z} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\sqrt{z_{01}} & \\\\ & \\\\sqrt{z_{02}} \\\\ & & \\\\ddots \\\\ & & & \\\\sqrt{z_{0N}} \\\\end{pmatrix} and \\\\sqrt{y} = (\\\\sqrt{z})^{-1} is the corresponding diagonal matrix of square roots of characteristic admittances. In these expressions the matrices represented by the bracketed factors commute and so, as shown above, may be written in either order.Any square matrix commutes with itself and with the identity matrix, and if two matrices A and B commute, then so do A and B‚àí1 (since AB‚àí1 = B‚àí1BAB‚àí1 = B‚àí1ABB‚àí1 = B‚àí1A) Two port In the special case of a two-port network, with the same characteristic impedance z_{01} = z_{02} = Z_0 at each port, the above expressions reduce to :Z_{11} = {((1 + S_{11}) (1 - S_{22}) + S_{12} S_{21}) \\\\over \\\\Delta_S} Z_0 \\\\, :Z_{12} = {2 S_{12} \\\\over \\\\Delta_S} Z_0 \\\\, :Z_{21} = {2 S_{21} \\\\over \\\\Delta_S} Z_0 \\\\, :Z_{22} = {((1 - S_{11}) (1 + S_{22}) + S_{12} S_{21}) \\\\over \\\\Delta_S} Z_0 \\\\, Where :\\\\Delta_S = (1 - S_{11}) (1 - S_{22}) - S_{12} S_{21} \\\\, The two-port S-parameters may be obtained from the equivalent two-port Z-parameters by means of the following expressions :S_{11} = {(Z_{11} - Z_0) (Z_{22} + Z_0) - Z_{12} Z_{21} \\\\over \\\\Delta} :S_{12} = {2 Z_0 Z_{12} \\\\over \\\\Delta} \\\\, :S_{21} = {2 Z_0 Z_{21} \\\\over \\\\Delta} \\\\, :S_{22} = {(Z_{11} + Z_0) (Z_{22} - Z_0) - Z_{12} Z_{21} \\\\over \\\\Delta} where :\\\\Delta = (Z_{11} + Z_0) (Z_{22} + Z_0) - Z_{12} Z_{21} \\\\, The above expressions will generally use complex numbers for S_{ij} \\\\, and Z_{ij} \\\\, . Note that the value of \\\\Delta\\\\, can become 0 for specific values of Z_{ij} \\\\, so the division by \\\\Delta \\\\, in the calculations of S_{ij} \\\\, may lead to a division by 0. Relation to Y-parameters Conversion from Y-parameters to Z-parameters is much simpler, as the Z-parameter matrix is just the inverse of the Y-parameter matrix. For a two-port: :Z_{11} = {Y_{22} \\\\over \\\\Delta_Y} \\\\, :Z_{12} = {-Y_{12} \\\\over \\\\Delta_Y} \\\\, :Z_{21} = {-Y_{21} \\\\over \\\\Delta_Y} \\\\, :Z_{22} = {Y_{11} \\\\over \\\\Delta_Y} \\\\, where :\\\\Delta_Y = Y_{11} Y_{22} - Y_{12} Y_{21} \\\\, is the determinant of the Y-parameter matrix.

History  The oldest part of the building, the donjon, was built on a strategic rock high above the valley of the river Hoyoux. The oldest parts still visible today date probably from the 13th century and were erected by the lords of Modave. In the 16th century the castle and the estate of Modave became the property of the Haultepenne and de Saint-Fontaine families. In the next century Jean-Gaspard-Ferdinand de Marchin (1601‚Äì1673), a great military commander, acquired the castle and turned it from a medieval fortress into a luxury Baroque residence. His son Ferdinand de Marsin neglected the property and lived in France. Later owners were successively: * Maximilian Henry of Bavaria, Elector of Cologne and Prince- Bishop of Li√®ge (1682‚Äì1684); * Cardinal William Egon of Furstenberg, and his heirs (1684‚Äì1706); * Baron Arnold de Ville (1706‚Äì1772); and * Anne-L√©on, Duke of Montmorency, and his heirs (1772‚Äì1817). In the 19th century it was owned by the non-noble families of Lamarche, Braconier and Van Hoegaerden. Finally, the Compagnie Intercommunale Bruxelloise des Eaux (\\"Brussels Intercommunal Water Company\\") bought the property in March 1941, in order to protect the important water catchments in the park. The company still owns the ch√¢teau today and has been restoring it with great care. It is open for visitors from April until October and it is also used as a prestigious venue for concerts and receptions.  Architecture  The ancient fortified castle was rebuilt from 1659 to 1667 in a manner showing a remarkable affinity to the most modern ideas of European country house building of the time. It is particularly close to the buildings of Fran√ßois Mansart. The dignified symmetry with a triangular pediment accenting the main frontage, the geometrical articulation of the wall, the mansard roofs, and the spatial contrast between the corps de logis and the side wings have much in common with Mansart's country houses, such as the Ch√¢teau de Maisons-Laffitte. Modave is the most prominent preserved example of High Baroque country-house architecture in the Southern Netherlands and the Prince-Bishopric of Li√®ge. The ch√¢teau is unique for its splendidly preserved historic interiors and furniture dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. The stucco ceilings date from the second half of the 17th century and were created by Jan-Christian Hansche.

Many members of the Saudi royal family descend maternally from the tribe , which is distributed throughout Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. The Otaibah are descended from the Bedouin. They trace back to the Mudar family and belong to the Qays  øAylƒÅn confederacy through its previous name, Hawazin. Research of the lineage of northern tribes may began with Adnan (instead of Ishmael), as passed on by oral tradition. He is the common ancestor of the modern Otaibah, Annazah, Tamim, Abd al-Qays, and Quraysh tribes. Although Adnan is at the head of the tribal genealogy, genealogists and poets typically refer to two of his descendants: his son Ma'ad (a later collective term for all north Arabian tribes) and his grandson Nizar, ancestor of Rabi'ah and Mudar. Mudar, the son of Nizar, fathered  øAylƒÅn al-NƒÅs (the ancestor of Hawazin and Otaibah). The Hawazin is another tribe related to the Otaibah. The tribe's common ancestors are Otaibah, Guzayah, Banu Jusham, Mu øƒÅwiya, Bakr, HawƒÅzin, Man·π£≈´r,  øIkrima, KÃ≤hÃ≤a·π£afa, Qays  øAylƒÅn, Mudir, Nijzar, Ma'ad and Adnan of the Ishmaelites. The tribe, five or six hundred years old, is primarily found in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.  Genealogy  According to genealogy and oral tradition, the Otaibah tribe are descended from the pre-Islamic Hawazin. The Hawazin are descendants of the Qays  øAylƒÅn (descendants of Ma'ad [son of Adnan]) or the Adnanites, descendants of the Ishmaelites (the sons of Ishmael, the elder son of Abraham). The only known copy of historian and genealogist Hisham ibn al- Kalbi's 8th-century AD The Great Ancestrywas examined then verified in 1988 by Mahmud Firdous al Adm, who found portions of the manuscript in the research of Werner Caskel, a professor at the University of Berlin and the University of Cologne during the 1940s. According to the manuscript: > \\"Otaibah\\" is attributed to a standard; one of the banners that belong to the > tribe of Hawazin. (The name derives from a man) and he is, Otaibah Ibn > Guzayah Ibn Jusham Ibn Ibn Mu'awiyah ibn Bakr Ibn Hawazin. The clans > (subdivisions) of Hawazin all united under one of his descendants in an > early time during the first centuries; other nations from Hawazin > intertwined around him (as well). After most of the clans of Hawazin > departed (resettled away) from the land of Hejaz and Najd to the (great and) > wide lands of God. To the Sham (the Levant), Iraq, Egypt, the farthermost > western lands (North Africa), the lands of Persia, and its surrounding > Persian territories. None was left of them except those who could not leave > their land and country. Those who remained, formed the largest Hawazin > alliance in our present time, and it was named Otaibah. Additionally, the > tribes of Bakr and Taghlib also congregated under its well-known banners. Other works by al-Kalbi include the Book of Idols and The Abundance of Kinship. According to the latter, \\"The descendants of Jusham Ibn Ibn Mu'awiyah ibn Bakr Ibn Hawazin are Guzayah, Oday, Ouseema. The sons of Guzayah are Juda'aa, Hami, Otaibah, and Outwara.\\" Ibn Kathir wrote in his 14th-century book, The Beginning and the End: > There is no doubt that Adnan is from the lineage of Ishmeal, the only fact > that disagreed upon (or being disputed) is the number of ancestors between > the two. Most of what was said (and known) is that the exact number is forty > fathers between Adnan and Ishmeal, and this is (largely) based on what is > written among the Christian and Jewish people, who know it from Baruch (the > Israelite scribe, disciple, and secretary of Jeremah) writer of The Book of > Jeremiah ... And Abu Jafar Al Tabari, and others, have concluded that the > almighty God had sent to Jeremiah son of Hilkiah a revelation to go to (the > King of Babylon) Nebuchadnezzar (II) and inform him that the almighty God > has given him authority over the (ancient) people of Arabia (the Qedarites). > God then commanded Jeremiah to take Ma'ad son of Adnan (far away from the > imminent conflict) on (a horse). So that he, (Ma'ad), will not be afflicted > by any resentfulness (since the victims cursed by the evils of > Nebuchadnezzar were his people). (As the command stated) For I, the almighty > God, will bring forth from him (Ma'ad son of Adnan) a generous prophet, and > the last among prophets. Jeremiah accepted the request, and carried Ma'ad to > the land (known as) the levant, where he grew among the sons of Israel; the > few whom survived after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem ... The > scribe who wrote the Book of Jeremiah, Baruch, transcribed the genealogy of > his master (and devoted friend) to have it preserved (with the books) in the > library of Jeremiah, and to save the lineage of Ma'ad (perhaps for posterity > and future generations), but God only knows (the exact truth). This is the > reason why Mailk (a primary scholar of prophetic traditions in the 8th > century) disliked tracing the lineage to before Adnan (or attempt to name > any of forefathers of Adnan, other than Ishmael himself, because no truthful > or precise record exists of these ancestors, save the Book of Jeremiah). The tribes of the northern Arabian Peninsula are descended from Ishmael. They are seldom referred to as the Ishmaelites, however, but are more often described as the Qays  øAylƒÅn. The southern tribes are descended from Qahtan, also known as Qahtanites. During the Umayyad era, a feud began between them. Scottish historian W. Montgomery Watt wrote that \\"to constitute something like a political party\\", the tribes began to identify the people of the Arabian Peninsula as Qays  øAylƒÅn or Qahtan. The rivalry led to open conflict during the Second Muslim Civil War (680‚Äì692). Most Otaibah genealogy is oral tradition dating to the Middle Ages and earlier. Muhammad's foster mother, Halimah al-Sa‚Äòdiyah, was from the Banu Sa'd tribe (a subdivision of the Hawazin, the Otaibah parent tribe. The lineage of the Otaibah tribe varies among scholars; some attribute the tribe to the sons of the Banu Sa'd ibn Hawazin, and others say that they are composed of the Banu Jusham ibn Muawiya ibn Bakr ibn Hawazin or the Banu 'Amir ibn Sa'sa'ah ibn Mu'awiyah ibn Bakr ibn Hawazin. However, accounts agree that their lineage traces back to Hawazin, son of Mansur, son of Ikrimah, son of Khasafah, son of Qays  øAylƒÅn, son of Mudar, son of Nizar, son of Ma'ad, son of Adnan.  History = Ottoman Empire (late 16th century to 1900)  upright=1.2 During the 16th century, the Ottomans added the Red Sea and Persian Gulf coast to their empire. They claimed rule of the interior as their central authority waxed and waned.Bowen, p. 68William J. Bernstein (2008) A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World. Grove Press. pp. 191 ff In the 18th century, the Mutayr (aided by the Qahtan) began a series of wars against the Anazzah for the pastures of central Najd and forced the Anazzah north. The Mutayr and Qahtan were superseded by the Otaibah, who remain the largest tribe in central Najd. During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Otaibah and ·∏§arb were counterparts in the centuries-long struggle among the Sharifs of Mecca and the ruling families of Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saud for Najd. Nineteenth- and early-20th-century Otaibah history reflects the wars in Najd and Hejaz, whose belligerents tried to enlist the tribe's support. In 1816, the Wahhabi kingdom was defeated by the Egyptians. Their leader, Ibrahim Mohammed Ali, persuaded the Otaibah and several Anazzah tribes to assist him against Abdullah bin Saud. Between 1842 and 1872, nine powers (including the Otaibah) were at war in Najd. In 1872, Otaibah chief Muslit bin Rubayan attacked western settlements of Riyadh. Saud bin Faisal immediately made a retaliatory raid on their territory, in which he was defeated and critically wounded. In 1881 and 1882, the Otaibah plundered camps of Harb tribes who were subjects of Ibn Rashid. They unsuccessfully attacked Rashid in the summer of 1883. Members of the House of Saud joined Grand Sharif of Mecca Awn Al-Rafiq in 1897, and undertook campaigns against Ibn Rashid with Otaibah aid. The tribal war between Otaibah and Ibn Rashid began after a comment by the Otaibah poet Mukhlad Al-Qthami to Rashidi leader Muhammed Ibn Abdullah at his court (translated from a nomadic dialect of Arabic): We are the Otaibah. Oh, how many warriors we've slain Because our legions are a steady team.  Early 20th century  The Ottoman Empire continued to control most of the peninsula. However, Arabia had its own rulers: a group of tribal chiefs in Najd and its surrounding area, and the Sharif of Mecca ruled the Hejaz. The Otaibah cooperated with Al Saud of Najd, but sided with the Sharifs of Mecca (who took refuge with the tribe in times of adversity).H. Kindermann-[C.E. Bosworth]. \\"'Utayba.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2007. During World War I in 1915, Ibn Saud began an ambitious plan to settle the nomadic tribes in his territory (which included Najd and the east coast of Arabia. This was accomplished with the indoctrination of the tribes in religious ideals by Muhammad ibn Abd Al- Wahhab, since the nomadic Arab Bedouin (including the Otaibah) were not considered religious. In 1916, with British support, Sharif of Mecca Hussein bin Ali led a revolt against the Ottoman Empire to create a united state. The Arab Revolt of 1916‚Äì1918 failed, but the Allied victory in World War I resulted in the end of Ottoman control of Arabia.  øAbd ai- øAzƒ´z began to establish settlements known as al-HidÃ≤jÃ≤ar (singular hidÃ≤jÃ≤ra ), followed by Sultan bin Bajad Al-Otaibi of NadÃ≤jÃ≤d in promoting the settlement of Saudi Arabia's people during the first quarter of the century. This was accompanied by the Ikhwan (the Brethren), a political, military, and religious movement.  øAbd ai- øAzƒ´z, its founder, attempted to kindle religious enthusiasm among the rarely-pious and often-unpredictable tribes as a start for the reclamation and control of his domain. The spread of religious enlightenment by the mu·π≠awwi ø≈´n (preachers) prepared the idea of an agricultural, settled life, and the first (and most successful) settlement was established in 1912 by the Mutayr tribe. This settlement was soon followed by another by the Otaibah. Their inhabitants were members of Ikhwan. An important cause and new religious regulations, standards, and principles helped nomadic people leave their desert-dwelling culture and begin to live in groups, giving birth to a number of societies. The conflict with ƒÄl RasÃ≤hÃ≤ƒ´d of ·∏§ƒÅ æil and the Sharifs in Mecca drove the process of settlement further, leading to about 130 such colonies across Arabia. Although efforts were made to bring different tribes together in a single settlement to end feuding, most of the settlements became associated with specific tribes. According to lists compiled by Oppenheim and Caskel, the ·∏§arb had 27 settlements, the Otaibah 19, the Mu·π≠ayr 16, the Ajman 14, the Shammar nine and the Qahtan eight. The hidÃ≤jÃ≤ras were in Najd and on Arabia's east coast. They reached the edge of the al-Rub ø al-KÃ≤hÃ≤ƒÅlƒ´ desert in the south, and the Syrian Desert in the north. In the west, they extended to the mountains of Hejaz and Asir. Otaibah Sultan ibn Bjad and Eqab bin Mohaya enlisted in the Ikhwan movement, and were deployed by Ibn Saud against regional rivals. They led tribal forces in the occupation of Al-Hasa, Ha'il, Al-Baha, Jizan, Asir, Ta'if, Mecca, and Jeddah. This was considered a significant contribution in gaining control of the Hejaz region. After several victories, some Ikhwan factions resented policies which appeared to favor modernization and an increased number of non-Muslim foreigners in the region. Some Ikhwan members became more zealous than their founder, and turned against him. Sultan ibn Bjad joined leaders of other tribes in revolt in December 1928; Eqab bin Mohaya led his Otaibah tribe to aid King Abdul Aziz and vanquish the threat. Eqab and his followers were not the only members of the tribe to ally with the young king the revolution was doomed when a large Otaibah faction (Roug, under the command of  øUmar Ibn Rubay øƒÅn) chose loyalty to Ibn Saud. In 1926, the inhabitants of Najd and Hejaz gave their allegiance ( bay øa ) to  øAbd al- øAzƒ´z. He accepted the title of king ( malik ) the following year and ruled the central and provincial governments, authorized by Islamic legal scholars (' øulamƒÅ æ') and Sharia law. Factions of the Ikhwan tribes (particularly the Mutayr, Otaibah and Ajman) supported the preservation of their chiefdoms‚Äîincluding the tribes‚Äô choice of markets, raiding, and political affiliations‚Äîbut were defeated in a series of battles during 1929 and 1930. Political opposition, including political parties, was subsequently forbidden. Centralization was apparent in economic change beginning in 1924, when  øAbd al- øAzƒ´z began to use taxation and pilgrimage income to build a central treasury. During this period, raids into neighbouring states were forbidden. On 29 March 1929, the revolution was suppressed at the Battle of Sabilla. After the defeat, another battle took place between two branches of the Otaibah tribe: Barka and Roug. The rebellious Barka branch fled under Sultan ibn Bjad, one of their three leaders. He and his men were defeated and captured at DÃ≤jÃ≤abala by  øUmar Ibn Rubay øƒÅn, in command of al-Roug elements loyal to the king. Ibn Bjad was later taken prisoner. In the final crushing of the Ikhwan rebellion in 1930, some settlements were completely destroyed. The king then created the nucleus of a modern, standing army, which proved its worth in establishing peace. On 23 September 1932, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was established in a successful unification of a large portion of the peninsula. Mid-20th to early 21st century Early in the kingdom's history, a House of Supplies provided food for the people. A harsh manager was memorialized by Shammar poet Hamad Al Rukhees: Oh (my) creator bestow ease (upon me) and (let me) Certainly (our future) days will (soon) be relieved as the free (falcon) gets full out of its own claw (hard effort and work). Late in the 20th century, King Faisal Al Saud was strongly supported by the Otaibah. When the king was crown prince (between 1953 and 1964), the Otaibah were warring with the Mutayr over land near the city of Ta'if. One spring, a committee was formed by the government to legally prohibit either tribe from occupying the land until the issue was resolved. Faisal Al Saud went to the source of the conflict to resolve it. He saw a roaming Otaibah shepherd herding sheep and camels and asked him, \\"Who are you?\\" The shepherd replied, \\"I am from the Otaibah tribe\\". The crown prince then said, \\"Very good. Take these verses of mine to your people, and they will know its meaning\\": > Oh son of Otaibah, what say him (when) his mother's cheek (the land) was > being defiled (by conflict)? In the core of all knowledge are solutions; > (therefore), take this message, take it (to them). With the poem, the crown prince emphasized that the land (their mother) was being defiled by the conflict. The shepherd said, \\"All right. I will take it to them, but I do not know who it is from (or who is its sender)\\". The crown prince replied, \\"The person speaking to you is Faisal Ibn Abdul Aziz\\". The shepherd responded, \\"A name significantly acknowledged and greatly praised; however, please take its response in verse\\": > Oh, greetings to the greatest of all solutions (manifested). If (we knew) > Faisal was against it (the conflict) We (the Otaibah) would evacuate the > land. Take (accept) this message, take it. And my mother (the land) is like > an elderly woman; rosy (gentle in essence), white (unspoiled) and clean is > her cheek. And (alongside) your mother (Arabia), succeeded only by the > strongest of kings, take this message, take it. The conflict ended soon afterwards. During the early 21st century, many Otaibah enlisted in Saudi Arabia's armed forces (particularly in the Saudi National Guard). = Great Mosque of Mecca siege = Otaibahs Juhayman al- Otaybi, his brother-in-law, Mohammed Abdullah al-Qahtani (reportedly the Mahdi) and hundreds of their followers seized the Great Mosque of Mecca on 20 November 1979. Although the rebels included Egyptians, Pakistanis and American converts, most were Saudi Otaibahs. The Grand Mosque seizure lasted until 4 December and resulted in the deaths of many civilian hostages, Saudi security personnel and most of the rebels, including Muhammad al-Qahtani. Juhayman and 67 of his fellow rebels who survived the assault were captured and publicly beheaded. Many rebels evaded capture and fled. In response to the seizure of the mosque, King Khalid bin Abdulaziz Al Saud gave more power to religious conservatives and ulamas. He reportedly believed that \\"the solution to the religious upheaval was simple: more religion.\\" Newspaper photographs of women were banned, followed by women on television. Cinemas and music shops were shut down. The educational curriculum was changed to provide many more hours of religious studies, eliminating classes on subjects such as non-Islamic history. Gender segregation was extended \\"to the humblest coffee shop\\", and the religious police became more assertive. Tribal branches Otaibah branches in a number of countries The Otaibah tribe is divided into three major branches: Barga (), Rog (ÿ±ŸàŸÇ) and Bano Saad (Sons of Saad, ÿ®ŸÜŸà ÿ≥ÿπÿØ). Each branch is divided into a number of clans, and each clan is divided into families.

Moffatt acted as a straight man to Hay, along with Moore Marriott, beginning in the film Windbag the Sailor. Plot outline Will Hay plays the penniless, bungling solicitor Benjamin Stubbins, who arrives at his office to find his insolent office boy (Graham Moffatt) with his feet up on the desk, reading a wild west magazine, which Hay confiscates so that he can read it later. Stubbins later takes a job from a group of Americans who claim they want him to track down some ancestors of theirs in Scotland. In reality, however, they want to use his office so they can rob a safe in the room immediately below his office. Stubbins takes the job (which is designed to keep him out of the office).

Two basic facts follow from this definition, which emphasizes its usefulness. # Physical properties must be invariant with respect to symmetry operations. # Symmetry operations can be collected together in groups which are isomorphic to permutation groups. Wavefunctions need not be invariant, because the operation can multiply them by a phase or mix states within a degenerate representation, without affecting any physical property.  Molecules = Identity Operation  C1, rotation by 360¬∞, is called the Identity operation and is denoted by E or I. In Identity operation, no change can be observed for the molecule. Even the most asymmetric molecule can undergo identity operation.  Reflection through mirror planes  A molecule that consists of a plane of symmetry possesses a mirror plane. When this plane of symmetry is parallel to the principal axis of the molecule (molecular z-axis), it is considered as a vertical plane (œÉv). If the plane of symmetry is perpendicular to the principal axis, then it is denoted as a horizontal mirror plane (œÉh). A dihedral mirror plane (œÉd) is the third type of plane of symmetry which bisects the angle between two 2-fold axes perpendicular to the principal axis. Through the reflection of each mirror plane, the molecule must be able to produce an identical image of itself.  Inversion operation  The inversion center is a point in space that lies in the geometric center of the molecule. During an inversion operation, all the atoms are moved through the center of the molecule in the opposite direction. As a result, all the cartesian coordinates of the atoms are inverted (i.e. x,y,z to -x,-y,-z).  Proper rotation operations  These are denoted by Cnm and are rotations of 360¬∞/n, performed m times. The superscript m is omitted if it is equal to one. Here the molecule can be rotated into equivalent positions around an axis. Cnn, n rotations 360¬∞/n is also an Identity operation. That is a complete set of rotations around the principal axis results in identity.  Improper rotation operations  These are denoted by Snm and are rotations of 360¬∞/n followed by reflection in a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis (œÉh). S1 is usually denoted as œÉ, a reflection operation about a mirror plane. S2 is usually denoted as i, an inversion operation about an inversion centre. When n is an even number Snn = E, but when n is odd Sn2n = E. Rotation axes, mirror planes and inversion centres are symmetry elements, not operations. The rotation axis of the highest order is known as the principal rotation axis. It is conventional to set the Cartesian z axis of the molecule to contain the principal rotation axis.  Examples  leftDichloromethane, CH2Cl2. There is a C2 rotation axis which passes through the carbon atom and the midpoints between the two hydrogen atoms and the two chlorine atoms. Define the z axis as co-linear with the C2 axis, the xz plane as containing CH2 and the yz plane as containing CCl2. A C2 rotation operation permutes the two hydrogen atoms and the two chlorine atoms. Reflection in the yz plane permutes the hydrogen atoms while reflection in the xz plane permutes the chlorine atoms. The four symmetry operations E, C2, œÉ(xz) and œÉ(yz) form the point group C2v. Note that if any two operations are carried out in succession the result is the same as if a single operation of the group had been performed. leftMethane, CH4. In addition to the proper rotations of order 2 and 3 there are three mutually perpendicular S4 axes which pass half-way between the C-H bonds and six mirror planes. Note that S42 = C2.  Crystals  In crystals screw rotations and/or glide reflections are additionally possible. These are rotations or reflections together with partial translation. These operations may change based on the dimensions of the crystal lattice. The Bravais lattices may be considered as representing translational symmetry operations. Combinations of operations of the crystallographic point groups with the addition symmetry operations produce the 230 crystallographic space groups.

PPO may accept monophenols and/or o-diphenols as substrates. The enzyme works by catalyzing the o-hydroxylation of monophenol molecules in which the benzene ring contains a single hydroxyl substituent to o-diphenols (phenol molecules containing two hydroxyl substituents at the 1, 2 positions, with no carbon between). It can also further catalyse the oxidation of o-diphenols to produce o-quinones. PPO catalyses the rapid polymerization of o-quinones to produce black, brown or red pigments (polyphenols) that cause fruit browning. The amino acid tyrosine contains a single phenolic ring that may be oxidised by the action of PPOs to form o-quinone. Hence, PPOs may also be referred to as tyrosinases. Common foods producing the enzyme include mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus), apples (Malus domestica), avocados (Persea americana), and lettuce (Lactuca sativa). Structure and function PPO is listed as a morpheein, a protein that can form two or more different homo-oligomers (morpheein forms), but must come apart and change shape to convert between forms. It exists as a monomer, trimer, tetramer, octamer or dodecamer, creating multiple functions. In plants, PPO is a plastidic enzyme with unclear synthesis and function. In functional chloroplasts, it may be involved in oxygen chemistry like mediation of pseudocyclic photophosphorylation. Enzyme nomenclature differentiates between monophenol oxidase enzymes (tyrosinases) and o-diphenol:oxygen oxidoreductase enzymes (catechol oxidases). Distribution and applications A mixture of monophenol oxidase and catechol oxidase enzymes is present in nearly all plant tissues, and can also be found in bacteria, animals, and fungi. In insects, cuticular polyphenol oxidases are present and their products are responsible for desiccation tolerance. Grape reaction product (2-S glutathionyl caftaric acid) is an oxidation compound produced by action of PPO on caftaric acid and found in wine. This compound production is responsible for the lower level of browning in certain white wines. Plants make use of polyphenol oxidase as one in a suite of chemical defences against parasites.  Inhibitors  Tyrosine is a key compound of pigmentation/browning reaction through the action of polyphenol oxidase. Discrimination of this pigmentation reaction is responsible for various types of diseases and disorders. There are two types of inhibitor of PPO, those competitive to oxygen in the copper site of the enzyme and those competitive to phenolics. Tentoxin has also been used in recent research to eliminate the PPO activity from seedlings of higher plants. Tropolone is a grape polyphenol oxidase inhibitor. Another inhibitor of this enzyme is potassium pyrosulphite (K2S2O5). Banana root PPO is strongly inhibited by dithiothreitol and sodium metabisulfite. Endogenous proteinous fractions act endogenous inhibitor/regulator of onion leaves PPO (monophenol monooxygenase and o-diphenol oxidase) Potassium dithionite (or potassium hydrosulfite) is also an inhibitor of PPO.  Assays  Several assays were developed to monitor the activity of polyphenol oxidases and to evaluate the inhibition potency of polyphenol oxidase inhibitors. In particular, ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) spectrophotometry-based assays are widely applied. The most common UV/Vis spectrophotometry assay involves the monitoring of the formation of o-quinones, which are the products of polyphenol oxidase-catalysed reactions, or the consumption of the substrate. Alternative spectrophotometric method that involves the coupling of o-quinones with nucleophilic reagents such as 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinonehydrazone hydrochloride (MBTH) was also used. Other techniques, such as activity staining assays with the use of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, tritium-based radioactive assays, oxygen consumption assay, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based assay were also reported and used.  Enzymatic browning  Polyphenol oxidase is an enzyme found throughout the plant and animal kingdoms, including most fruits and vegetables. PPO has importance to the food industry because it catalyzes enzymatic browning when tissue is damaged from bruising, compression or indentations, making the produce less marketable and causing economic loss. Enzymatic browning due to PPO can also lead to loss of nutritional content in fruits and vegetables, further lowering their value. Because the substrates of these PPO reactions are located in the vacuoles of plant cells damaged mainly by improper harvesting, PPO initiates the chain of browning reactions. Exposure to oxygen when sliced or pureed also leads to enzymatic browning by PPO in fruits and vegetables. Examples in which the browning reaction catalyzed by PPO may be desirable include avocados, prunes, sultana grapes, black tea, and green coffee beans.  In mango  In mangoes, PPO catalyzed enzymatic browning is mainly caused by sap burn which leads to skin browning. Catechol oxidase-type PPO is located in the chloroplasts of mango skin cells and its phenolic substrates in the vacuoles. Sap burn is therefore the initiating event of PPO in mango skin, as it breaks down cell compartments. PPO is located in mango skin, sap and pulp, with highest activity levels in skin. In avocado PPO in avocados causes rapid browning upon exposure to oxygen, a multistep process involving oxidation reactions of both monophenols and polyphenols, resulting in o-quinone products subsequently converted irreversibly into brown polymeric pigments (melanins).  In apple  Present in the chloroplasts and mitochondria of all parts of an apple, PPO is the major enzyme responsible for enzymatic browning of apples. Due to an increase in consumer demand for pre-prepared fruits and vegetables, a solution for enzymatic browning has been a targeted area of research and new product development. As an example, pre-sliced apples are an appealing consumer product, but slicing apples induces PPO activity, leading to browning of the cut surfaces and lowering their esthetic quality. Browning also occurs in apple juices and purees when poorly handled or processed. Arctic apples, an example of genetically modified fruit engineered to reduce PPO activity, are a suite of trademarked apples that contain a non-browning trait derived by gene silencing to suppress the expression of PPO, thus inhibiting fruit browning.  In apricot  Apricot as a climacteric fruit undergoes fast post-harvest maturation. The latent PPO form can spontaneously activate during the first weeks of storage, generating the active enzyme with a molecular weight of 38 kDa. Ascobic acid/proteases combinations constitute a promising practical anti-browning method as treated apricot purees preserved their color.  In potato  Found in high concentrations in potato tuber peel and 1‚Äì2 mm of the outer cortex tissue, PPO is used in the potato as a defense against insect predation, leading to enzymatic browning from tissue damage. Damage in the skin tissue of potato tuber causes a disruption of cell compartmentation, resulting in browning. The brown or black pigments are produced from the reaction of PPO quinone products with amino acid groups in the tuber. In potatoes, PPO genes are not only expressed in potato tubers, but also in leaves, petioles, flowers and roots.  Related enzymes  Prophenoloxidase is a modified form of the complement response found in some invertebrates, including insects, crabs and worms. Hemocyanin is homologous to the phenol oxidases (e.g. tyrosinase) since both enzymes sharing type copper active site coordination. Hemocyanin also exhibits PPO activity, but with slowed kinetics from greater steric bulk at the active site. Partial denaturation actually improves hemocyanin‚Äôs PPO activity by providing greater access to the active site. Aureusidin synthase is homologous to plant polyphenol oxidase, but contains certain significant modifications. Aurone synthase catalyzes the formation of aurones. Aurone synthase purified from Coreopsis grandiflora shows weak tyrosinase activity against isoliquiritigenin, but the enzyme does not react with the classic tyrosinase substrates L-tyrosine and tyramine and must therefore be classified as catechol oxidase.

The Swedish minister of finance has said it is an interesting idea, but the idea is still decades from being brought to fruition. There is a debate in the coastal cities on both sides, like Ume√• in Sweden and Vaasa in Finland. The official view from the Swedish and Finnish governments is that it is far too expensive. The natural values in the area also makes a bridge doubtful. A part of the area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The Proctor was a single-engined, low-wing monoplane with seating for three or four, depending on the model. Design and development The Proctor was developed from the Percival Vega Gull in response to Air Ministry Specification 20/38 for a radio trainer and communications aircraft. To meet the requirement, the aircraft based on the Vega Gull had larger rear cabin windows and the fuselage was six inches longer. Modifications were made to the seats to enable the crew to wear parachutes, and other changes to enable a military radio and other equipment to be fitted. In early 1939 an order was placed for 247 aircraft to meet operational requirement OR.65. The prototype aircraft, serial number P5998, first flew on 8 October 1939 from Luton Airport.Thetford, Owen. Aircraft of the Royal Air Force 1918‚Äì57, 1st edition. London: Putnam, 1957. and the type was put into production for the RAF and Fleet Air Arm. The prototype was tested as an emergency bomber during 1940 but this idea was abandoned as the invasion threat receded. Although the first 222 aircraft were built by Percival at Luton, most of the remaining aircraft were built by F. Hills & Sons of Trafford Park near Manchester. They built 812 Proctors of several marks between 1941 and 1945, assembling most of the aircraft at Barton Aerodrome.Scholefield 2004, p. 227. Whilst the very early Proctors (Mks I to III.) followed very closely the last incarnation of the Vega Gull, and consequently retained most of its performance, later versions became much heavier and less aerodynamic, with inevitable detrimental effects upon their performance. The later marks of Proctor, whilst looking broadly similar, were in fact a complete redesign of the aircraft and were much enlarged, heavier and even less efficient. Flight performance was poor. There were later plans to fit them with the 250 hp Queen 30 and larger airscrew, but only one trial aircraft was so fitted as the all-metal Prentice was being developed to replace the Proctor, utilising the Queen 30 etc. The Prentice itself proved to be a very poor aircraft (even worse than the later Proctors) and served in the RAF for only a handful of years before withdrawal as it was deemed unsatisfactory. The remaining Proctors in use soldiered-on after Service use in private hands until the 1960s. At this point, owing to concerns about the degradation of glued joints in their wooden airframes, they were all grounded. Several surviving Proctors have been rebuilt with modern adhesives and should be returned to the air shortly. Early Proctors still make good light aircraft, as they combine the Vega's attributes of Long-range, speed and load-carrying ability. Notably, all Proctors inherited the Vega Gull's feature of wing- folding. Operational history The Proctor was initially employed as a three-seat communications aircraft (Proctor I). This was followed by the Proctor II and Proctor III three-seat radio trainers. In 1941, the Air Ministry issued Specification T.9/41 for a four-seat radio trainer. The P.31 ‚Äì originally known as the \\"Preceptor\\" but finally redesignated the Proctor IV ‚Äì was developed for this requirement with an enlarged fuselage. One Proctor IV was fitted with a 250 hp (157 kW) Gipsy Queen engine. This was used as a personal transport by AVM Sir Ralph Sorley but production models retained the 210 hp (157 kW) motor of earlier marks. Proctor 5 of Field Aircraft services on a business flight to Manchester in 1953 At the end of the war, many early mark Proctors were sold on the civilian market and were operated in Australia, New Zealand and Europe. The Mk IV continued in service with the RAF until the last was withdrawn in 1955. In 1945, a civil model derived from the Proctor IV was put into production for private owner, business and light charter use as the Proctor 5. The RAF purchased four to be used by air attach√©s. The final model of the line was the solitary Proctor 6 floatplane sold to the Hudson's Bay Company in 1946. Three highly modified Percival Proctors, nicknamed the \\"Proctukas,\\" were produced for the film Battle of Britain as stand-ins for the Ju 87 Stuka.

The film stars Bob Hope in a rare dramatic role as Jimmy Walker, the colorful but controversial Mayor of New York City from 1926‚Äì32. Plot In 1925, New York's governor, Al Smith, persuades state senator James J. \\"Jimmy\\" Walker that the Democratic Party needs him to run for mayor of New York City. A concern on Jimmy's part is his estrangement from wife Allie, but he discovers that she is willing to go along with his political aims. Under the guidance of Chris Nolan, his political mentor, Jimmy wins the election in a landslide. He later learns, though, that Allie has no intention of renewing their relationship. She is simply satisfied to be the great city's first lady. A drunken Jimmy is found on a park bench by Betty Compton, who takes him home, not knowing who he is. She scolds him for his behavior upon learning Jimmy is the mayor, and a mutual attraction develops. He uses his political connections to help find her a job. Such favors and graft become a focal point in 1929's reelection campaign, when opponent Fiorello LaGuardia mocks the mayor publicly and questions the current administration's integrity. Jimmy also goes bankrupt due to the stock market's crash, and Betty grows despondent over his inability or unwillingness to get Allie to consent to a divorce. Still popular with the public, Jimmy is reelected. He tries to bring Betty to his victory party, but it is against his colleagues' wishes. Tired of being hidden, Betty attempts suicide. She is hustled out of the country by Chris and impulsively marries a man who has been courting her. The charges against Jimmy lead fellow Democrats to believe he could hurt Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidential hopes for 1932. Jimmy admits to having accepted bribes and favors, claiming all successful politicians do. His popularity erodes. Spectators at a Yankee Stadium baseball game boo him for the first time. Jimmy offers his resignation as mayor in a speech from the field. He decides to leave New York, whereupon Betty, after a quick divorce, intends to join him, married or not. Cast * Bob Hope as James J.

Thus, two measures of approximate a single measure of , while a single measure of 4/4 emulates 2/2. Half-time is not to be confused with alla breve or odd time. Though notes usually get the same value relative to the tempo, the way the beats are divided is altered. While much music typically has a backbeat on quarter note (crotchet) beats two and four, half time would increase the interval between backbeats to double, thus making it hit on beats three and seven, or the third beat of each measure (count out of an 8 beat measure [bar], common practice in half time): 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 Essentially, a half time 'groove' is one that expands one measure over the course of two. The length of each note is doubled while its frequency is halved. Common-time Rhythm pattern characteristic of much popular music including rock (), quarter note (crotchet) or \\"regular\\" time: \\"bass drum on beats 1 and 3 and snare drum on beats 2 and 4 of the measure [bar]...add eighth notes [quavers] on the hi-hat\\".Peckman, Jonathan (2007). Picture Yourself Drumming, p.50. . Time signatures are defined by how they divide the measure (in , complex triple time, each measure is divided in three, each of which is divided into three eighth notes: 3√ó3=9). In \\"common\\" time, often considered , each level is divided in two (simple duple time: 2√ó2=4). In a common-time rock drum pattern each measure (a whole note) is divided in two by the bass drum (half note), each half is divided in two by the snare drum (quarter note, collectively the bass and snare divide the measure into four), and each quarter note is divided in two by a ride pattern (eighth note). \\"Half\\"-time refers to halving this division (divide each measure into quarter notes with the ride pattern), while \\"double\\"-time refers to doubling this division (divide each measure into sixteenth notes with the ride pattern). Half-time Half time: notice the snare moves to beats 3 of measures (bars) one and two (beats 3 & 7) while the hi-hat plays only on the quarter notes (quavers). Note also, for example, that the quarter notes 'sound like' eighth notes in one giant measure. A classic example is the half-time shuffle, a variation of a shuffle rhythm, which is used extensively in hip-hop and some blues music. Some of the variations of the basic groove are notoriously difficult to play on drum set. It is also a favorite in some pop and rock tunes. Some classic examples are the Purdie Shuffle by Bernard Purdie which appears in \\"Home At Last\\" and \\"Babylon Sisters\\", both of which are Steely Dan songs.. Accessed 31 July 2014. \\"Fool in the Rain\\" by Led Zeppelin uses a derivation of the Purdie Shuffle, and Jeff Porcaro of Toto created a hybridization of the Zeppelin and Purdie shuffles called the Rosanna shuffle for the track \\"Rosanna\\". Quarter note shuffleMattingly, Rick (2006). All About Drums, p.44. Hal Leonard. . \\"Basic half time shuffle\\"Potter, Dee (2001). The Drummer's Guide to Shuffles, p.19. . . It is important to realize that while in half time, the feel of notes are chopped in half, but the actual time value remains the same. For example, at the same tempo, 8th notes (quavers) would sound like 16ths (semiquavers). In the case of the half time shuffle, triplets sound like 16th note (semiquaver) triplets, etc. By preserving the tempo, the beat is stretched by a factor of 2. Double-time In music and dance, double-time is a type of meter and tempo or rhythmic feel by essentially halving the tempo resolution or metric division/level. It is also associated with specific time signatures such as . Contrast with half time. In jazz the term means using note values twice as fast as previously but without changing the pace of the chord progressions. It is often used during improvised solos.Randel, Don Michael (2003).

The two terms are used either differently or interchangeably by different authors. Phyllocladus, a genus of conifer, is named after these structures. Phylloclades/cladodes have been identified in fossils dating from as early as the Permian. Definition and morphology The term \\"phylloclade\\" is from the New Latin phyllocladium, itself derived from Greek phyllo, leaf, and klados, branch. Definitions of the terms \\"phylloclade\\" and \\"cladode\\" vary. All agree that they are flattened structures that are photosynthetic and resemble leaf-like branches. In one definition, phylloclades are a subset of cladodes, namely those that greatly resemble or perform the function of leaves, p. 448 as in Butcher's broom (Ruscus aculeatus) as well as Phyllanthus and some Asparagus species. By an alternative definition, cladodes are distinguished by their limited growth and that they involve only one or two internodes. By this definition, some of the most leaf-like structures are cladodes, rather than phylloclades. By that definition, Phyllanthus has phylloclades, but Ruscus and Asparagus have cladodes. Another definition uses \\"phylloclade\\" to refer a portion of a leaf- like stem or branch with multiple nodes and internodes, and \\"cladode\\" for a single internode of a phylloclade. p. 87. Although phylloclades are usually interpreted as modified branches, developmental studies have shown that they are intermediate between leaves and branches as their name indicates. Molecular genetic investigations have confirmed these findings. For example, Hirayama et al. (2007) showed that the phylloclade of Ruscus aculeata \\"is not homologous to either the shoot or the leaf, but that it has a double organ identity,\\" which means that it combines shoot and leaf processes. Phylloclades also occur in Bryophyllum and Kalanchoe. Similar structures * Aristate leaves end in a stiff point that may continue the primary leaf vein; this can resemble the stem end of a phylloclade/cladode. * Epiphylly: flowers and fruit develop \\"on a leaf\\".

Article 2 was designed to prevent acts undertaken by the Allies during the German occupation from being questioned retroactively by West German courts.Miriam Aziz References pp. 5,6 Miriam Aziz of The Robert Schumann Centre, of the European University Institute, makes the point that there is a difference between the wording of the Settlement Convention \\"the full authority of a sovereign State\\" and the wording in the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany of 1990 in which Germany is referred to as having \\"full sovereignty over its internal and external affairs\\", gives rise to a distinction between de facto and de jure sovereignty.Miriam Aziz References p. 6 Detlef Junker of the Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg agrees with this analysis: \\"In the October 23, 1954, Paris Agreements, Adenauer pushed through the following laconic wording: 'The Federal Republic shall accordingly [after termination of the occupation regime] have the full authority of a sovereign state over its internal and external affairs.' If this was intended as a statement of fact, it must be conceded that it was partly fiction and, if interpreted as wishful thinking, it was a promise that went unfulfilled until 1990. The Allies maintained their rights and responsibilities regarding Berlin and Germany as a whole, particularly the responsibility for future reunification and a future peace treaty.\\"Detlef Junker (editor), Translated by Sally E.

His father became President of the state of Haiti in 1807, and on March 28, 1811 he was proclaimed King of Haiti. The Prince Royal had two older brothers who both died before the proclamation of the kingdom, so he became the heir apparent with the title Prince Royal of Haiti, which came with the style of Royal Highness. Following the death of his father on October 8, 1820, the Prince Royal should have been proclaimed as King Henry II of Haiti, but the country was already in turmoil and he never had a chance.

She has written in many genres, but is best known for two popular mystery series, the Irene Adler Sherlockian suspense novels and the Midnight Louie mystery series. Douglas was a theater and English literature major in college. After graduation, she worked as a newspaper reporter and then editor in the [Minneapolis-St. Paul] area. During her time there, she discovered a long, expensive classified advertisement offering a black cat named Midnight Louie to the \\"right\\" home for one dollar and wrote a feature story on the plucky survival artist, putting it into the cat's point of view. The cat found a country home but its name was revived for her feline PI mystery series many years later. Some of the Midnight Louie series entries include the dedication \\"For the real and original Midnight Louie. Nine lives were not enough.\\" She began writing fiction in the late 1970s. The late director/playwright/novelist Garson Kanin, a pleased interview subject, took her first novel to Doubleday and it sold shortly after. Amberleigh is a post-feminist historical Gothic novel. Douglas has always addressed women's issues in her fiction and preferred mixing genres from contemporary to historical mystery/thriller, romance and women's fiction, and high and urban fantasy.1998 interview with Carole Nelson Douglas in Crescent City Blues Douglas lives in north Texas with her husband, Sam Douglas, and adopted cats.Alter, Judy. \\"These Texas women love a good mystery.\\" The Dallas Morning News, 6 July 2008.

However, the coming of colonialists had clipped the sovereignty of the Ijebu's and their right over the Lagos transit. It was during the latter period that he was born to the family of an Ijebu produce trader. He attended St Saviour's School, Italupe but he left at the age of fifteen after the death of his father. He was transferred to Ile- Ife by his family to ease his mother's burden but he later returned to Ijebu Ode to re-unite with his family and try to complete his secondary education. He then registered and attended the Ijebu Ode Grammar school for four years. After cutting short his secondary education, he left for Lagos to fend for himself. He became a clerk in various departments of the Lagos Colony and later, in the Ijebu Native Administration. He occupied his spare time by engaging in private trading from 1921-1932. Business career In 1932, he resigned his positioning as a court clerk and entered private enterprise. He soon opened damask stores and fish stalls at various cities in western Nigeria, such as Ife, Ibadan, Ilesha and Lagos. After, his subtle beginnings as a fishing net and damask trader, he entered the Cocoa and Palm trading business and started buying lorries to transport the produce to Lagos for export. He built two large commodity storage stores during this period, one was located at Ijebu Ode, he was also involved in the business and political community as a member of the Produce Buyers Union and the Nigerian Youth Movement. However, the establishment of marketing boards, and the subsequent power of the boards to regulate Cocoa and Palm oil trading proved to be an inhibiting factor to private entrepreneurship in the commodity produce business. Odutola, gradually, transferred his resources and energy to saw milling and gold mining at Ilesha. He also became a major agent for John Holt Nigeria. At the beginning of the drive towards industrialisation in Nigeria, Odutola extended his industrial prowess to the production of rubber goods and started the manufacturing of cycle tyres and tubes in 1967. Throughout his career, he established various factories in the country, spanning, the transport and food industry, he also built a secondary school at Ijebu-Ode. He was a member and later president of the Nigerian Stock Exchange and the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria in the early 70s.

The law covers the creation, transfer, and ownership of property in the mainland of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and is part of an ongoing effort by the PRC to gradually develop a civil code. it contains all aspects of property law in the PRC's legal system. The law was drafted quite differently from the usual legislative process in the PRC where laws are drafted behind closed doors, over 14 000 public submissions were considered for over a decade before the law was adopted and put into effect. In developing civil law in the PRC mainland, the PRC government has used the German Pandectist system of classification under which the property law corresponds to the law on real rights, which is the term used in Chinese for the official name of the law. Passage The drafting of the law involved considerable controversy. The proposed bill caused quite a stir since it was first published in 2002, was subsequently deferred, and yet again failed in its reading at the National People's Congress (NPC) of 2006 because of disputes over its content. It finally went through its eighth reading in 2007.New property law shakes up China, BBC News, Thursday, 8 March 2007, 13:10 GMT. Many in the Chinese legal community feared that creating a single law to cover both state property and private property would facilitate privatization and asset stripping of state-owned enterprises. The draft law was subject to a constitutional challenge. Legal scholars, notably Gong Xiantian of Peking University, argued that it violated the constitutional characterization of the PRC as a socialist state. The law was originally scheduled to be adopted in 2005, but was removed from the legislative agenda following these objections. The final form of the law contains a number of additions to address these objections. On March 8, 2007, the Property Law was formally introduced at the NPC. Vice-Chairman Wang Zhaoguo told the Congress that the law will \\"safeguard the fundamental interests of the people\\", and the law is an attempt at adapting to new \\"economic and social realities\\" in China. The law was adopted on March 16, the final day of the two-week session of congress, with the backing of 96.9% of the 2,889 legislators attending, with 2799 for, 52 against, and 37 abstentions. In his final address to the 2007 Session, NPC Chairman Wu Bangguo declared \\"the Private Property Law and the Corporate Taxation law are two of the most important laws in the new economic system of Socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must attempt to learn these laws fully through various methods.\\"Original statement according to BBC was: \\"Áâ©ÊùÉÊ≥ï„ÄÅ‰ºÅ‰∏öÊâÄÂæóÁ®éÊ≥ïÊòØ‰∏≠ÂõΩÁâπËâ≤Á§æ‰ºö‰∏ª‰πâÊ≥ïÂæã‰ΩìÁ≥ª‰∏≠ÁöÑÈáçË¶ÅÊ≥ïÂæãÔºåË¶ÅÈááÂèñÂ§öÁßçÂΩ¢ÂºèÂπøÊ≥õÂÆ£‰º†ÂíåÊ∑±ÂÖ•Â≠¶‰π†Ëøô‰∏§ÈÉ®Ê≥ïÂæã„ÄÇ\\" Description The Property Law contains 5 parts, 19 chapters and 247 articles. The parts deal with the following topics: Part One - General Provisions Part Two - Ownership Part Three - Usufructs Part Four - Security Interest in Property Part Five - Possession. The main purpose of the law is stated in Article 1. \\"This Law is enacted in accordance with the Constitution for the purpose of upholding the basic economic system of the State, maintaining the order of the socialist market economy, defining the attribution of things, giving play to the usefulness of things and protecting the property right of obligees.\\" Article 9 states, \\"The creation, alteration, transfer or extinction of the property right shall become valid upon registration according to law; otherwise it shall not become valid, unless otherwise provided for by law. Registration of ownership of all the natural resources which are owned by the State in accordance with law may be dispensed with.\\" The law covers all of the three property types within the People's Republic of China, which are state, collective, and private which are defined in Chapter 5 of the law. Chapter 4, Article 40 of the law divides property rights into three types: ownership rights, use rights, and security rights. The law goes into detail about the legal rights associated with any of these three types. The law does not change the system of land tenure by which the state owns all land. However, in formalizing existing practice, individuals can possess a land-use right, which is defined in Chapter 10 of the law. The law defines this land-use right in terms of the civil law concept of usufruct. Response Some press reports have characterized this law as the first piece of legislation in the People's Republic of China to cover an individual's right to own private assets,China passes new law on property, BBC News, Friday, 16 March 2007, 02:51 GMT. although this is incorrect as the right to private property was written into the Constitution of the People's Republic of China in 2004.

As one of Pakistan's most prominent journalists, Abbasi generally holds socially conservative and nationalist views. He has been critical of liberal activists including Malala Yousafzai and the Ahmadiyya movement. He has called on a ban on Indian channels and strict checks on culturally offensive content in Pakistani dramas and movies. According to The Huffington Post, Abbasi holds orthodox religious views and rigid anti-American views. Early life Abbasi was born in Murree, Pakistan, to a Dhund Abbasi family of that locality. He received his early education in his native village. Abbasi obtained matriculation or finished his basic education from Sir Syed School, Rawalpindi. Later he joined Government College Asghar Mall, where he completed his Intermediate and Bachelor of Arts education. He received his master's degree from Balochistan University, Quetta. He also earned another master's degree from Goldsmiths College, University of London. His research thesis was on child labor. Today, Ansar Abbasi undoubtedly stands as a prominent icon in journalism in Pakistan. He has been writing for the English newspapers for a long time. He is the youngest son of Muhammad Sajawal Abbasi (Late) who died in 1981. He belongs to the clan of Abbasis from the beautiful Murree Hills. Career It was a planned career move. After doing his master's degree in Mass Communication, Ansar opted to be a journalist in 1991. He wanted to join the popular Urdu daily Jang. However, as a matter of what he now regards as good luck, he got his first career appointment with an English Daily: 'The Democrat'. After Masters in Mass Communication, Abbasi began his career as a professional journalist in 1991. His first stint was with an English language daily, The Democrat. Later, he worked for two months at Pakistan Times newspaper, before eventually joining The News International, of which he is now an editor. He regards English journalism better than Urdu journalism, as he feels that mostly an Urdu journalist does nothing but dealing with 'Statement Journalism'. His own experience tells him that English Journalism in Pakistan gives a journalist more growth opportunities and more chances to learn. He feels good that he landed in English Journalism from the very start.  Experiences abroad  While pursuing his master's degree from the United Kingdom, he learnt a great deal from his School and from the exposure otherwise as well. He believes that he learnt more from travelling and visiting places than what he did from the curriculum at school. He acknowledges the system of education and research over there and finds the standards of labs and libraries really up to the mark. He feels a dire need that the authorities look into the dilapidated state of government universities in Pakistan and to equip them with what the student of today needs. His research thesis there included one on 'Child Labor' and for that particular one he found more than enough data on it, more than what he would have ever dreamt of in any university's library in Pakistan; given that Pakistan is a developing country and faces the menace of Child Labor to a much more alarming extent as compared to the UK.

Maulana Fazl ur Rahman In November 2008, Abbasi published a story on the award of acres of military land worth millions of rupees to the family members of the leader of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam, Maulana Fazl ur Rahman. Abbasi alleged that the regime of the then President General Pervez Musharraf attempted to buy off Maulana's opposition to General Musharraf's assumption of two public offices at a time. Justice Dogar \\"Our Special Daughters\\", an investigative report by Abbasi in Daily News, found out that Justice Dogar's daughter Farah Hameed Dogar's examination paper for F.Sc. was reassessed in violation of a previous Supreme Court ruling.

There are four species in three genera (Avsunviroid, Elaviroid and Pelamoviroid). They consist of RNA genomes between 246-375 nucleotides in length. They are single-stranded covalent circles and have intramolecular base pairing. All members lack a central conserved region. Replication Replication occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. Key features of replication include no helper virus required and no proteins are encoded for. Unlike the other family of viroids, Pospiviroidae, Avsunviroidae are thought to replicate via a symmetrical rolling mechanism. It is thought the positive RNA strand acts as a template to form negative strands with the help of an enzyme thought to be RNA polymerase plus 3 II. The negative RNA strands are then cleaved by ribozyme activity and circularises. A second rolling circle mechanism forms a positive strand which is also cleaved by ribozyme activity and then ligated to become circular. The site of replication is unknown but it is thought to be in the chloroplast and in the presence of Mg2+ ions. Structure Predictions of structure have suggested that they exist either as rod-shaped molecules with regions of base pairing causing formation of some hair pin loops or have branched configurations. The family has four stretches of conserved nucleotides, , , , from 5' to 3', plus their Watson-Crick pairings on the other end of the loop. This is part of its hammerhead ribozyme. Classification The family has three genera, with a total of five species. *Family Avsunviroidae **Genus Avsunviroid; type species: Avocado sunblotch viroid ***Species: Avocado sunblotch viroid **Genus Elaviroid; type species: Eggplant latent viroid ***Species: Eggplant latent viroid **Genus Pelamoviroid; type species: Peach latent mosaic viroid ***Species: Appler hammerhead viroid, Chrysanthemum chlorotic mottle viroid and Peach latent mosaic viroid  Detection  The lack of a long, central conserved region makes Avsunviroidae harder to identify than Pospiviroidae. A method to detect them is to use their circularity: a computer can piece together many overlapping reads that appear to form repeats when placed linearly.

Biography Kurata was born in what is now rural Sh≈çbara city, Hiroshima Prefecture to a wealthy merchant family.Meeting the Sensei, pages 147-163 He graduated from the No.1 High School in Tokyo and made his home in a cottage on the banks of Ueno Pond. He was highly influenced by the writings of Nishida Kitar≈ç and his concepts of religious syncretism, travelling to Kyoto meet the philosopher in 1912. However, Kurata was forced to leave Tokyo in 1913 due to health reasons, as he was suffering from both lung and bone tuberculosis and venereal disease. After a period in a hospital in Hiroshima, he traveled extensively around the Inland Sea region of Japan. He also became interested in the writings of philosopher and cult-leader Nishida Tenko, who had created an agrarian commune based on a mixture of Daoism, Christianity, Buddhism, and pacifism, and whose teachings were attracting a wide following in the slum areas near Japan's major cities. Nishida accepted Kurata as a follower in December 1915, and he came to the commune with his nurse and lover, Haru Kanda, who gave birth to his son in March 1917. However, Kurata was not physically strong enough for work at the commune, and his health quickly deteriorated. In 1917, Kurata wrote Shukke to sono deshi (\\"The Priest and his Apprentice\\") a stage play about the 13th century Buddhist priest Shinran, which quickly became a best-seller. Initially contributing articles on philosophy and religion to the Shirakaba literary journal, he became acquainted with Mushanok≈çji Saneatsu. However, Mushanokoji had very little regard to Nishida Tenko and his ideas, and was somewhat indifferent to Kurata. In July 1918, under nervous stress, Kurata was hospitalized in Fukuoka. In January, still mostly bed-ridden, he moved to a Buddhist temple in Fukuoka and joining Mushanok≈çji's commune, Atarashiki-mura as an external member. He organized public lectures, held concerts and even installed a printing press near his bed. Thinking that Kurata was on his deathbed, Nishida sent a mortuary tablet with Kurata's posthumous name inscribed on it, which Kurata accepted with somewhat mixed feelings, as he wrote in a letter to Masao Kume in March 1919 He also wrote Ai to ninshiki to no shuppatsu (\\"The Beginning of Love and Understanding\\", 1921), a collection of essays on diverse subjects ranging from love and sex to religion that became a classic with young people in pre-war Japan. page 22-23 However, Kurata had a falling out with the Shirakaba group in 1922, as Mushanok≈çji joined critics in lambasting his most recent play Chichi no Shimpai (\\"A Father's Worry\\", 1921), and the Atarashiki-mura faced bankruptcy. His private life also attracted unfavorable press, as he was living polygamous with three women under the same roof. Politically, Kurata made a sharp turn to the religious right, and embraced the concepts of fascism, advocating a theocracy based on the teachings of Shinran Kurata died in 1943 at his home in Magome, Tokyo, and his grave is in Tama Cemetery, at Fuch≈´, Tokyo.

With his brother Pasquale (Pat), Petronelli managed and trained world middleweight champion Marvin Hagler. His other fighters included Robbie Sims, Steve Collins, and Kevin McBride. In 1983, the Petronellis received The Al Buck Award for Manager of the Year by the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Career He was born in Brockton, Massachusetts. Petronelli was a successful amateur welterweight boxer who retired from the US Navy as a master chief after serving from 1941-69. He grew up as a close friend of Rocky Marciano. Both their fathers had emigrated from the Abruzzo region of Italy. Petronelli was also a friend of Marciano's trainer, Allie Colombo.Hagler trainer Goody Petronelli dies at 88, Boston Globe, 31 January 2012 (accessed 2 February 2012) The Petronelli brothers opened their Brockton gym in 1969, the same year both Marciano and Colombo died (in a plane crash and an auto accident respectively.) Petronelli focused on training fighters, relying on his Navy medical experience as a cut man in the ring, while Pat mainly handled the business aspects, including fight scheduling and purse negotiations. The teen-aged Hagler, who had moved with his mother from Newark, New Jersey to Brockton in 1967, began training at the gym shortly after it opened. Under Petronelli's tutelage, he became the National AAU 165-pound champion in 1973. Though Hagler was a top-ranked middleweight title contender for most of the 1970s, the Petronellis found it difficult to line up high-profile opponents willing to risk facing him. Hagler's race and the fact that he was a Southpaw, and a good one at that, were cited as primary obstacles.Kellerman, Max. Mexican fighters taking jab at perceptions, ESPN.com, 21 February 2003 (accessed 2 February 2012) The brothers often had to travel with Hagler to other fighters' hometowns for his bouts. Petronelli and his brother finally got Hagler his shot at the WBA and WBC middleweight titles in 1979 against Vito Antuofermo in Las Vegas, where the fight was ruled a draw in a controversial 15-round decision. In 1980, after winning 50 of 54 pro fights, Hagler got his second chance at the crowns when he faced British fighter Alan Minter, who had earlier won the title from Antuofermo. Hagler bloodied Minter early, winning on a third-round TKO. The Petronellis would guide Hagler through 12 successful world title defenses over 7 years, including celebrated bouts against Roberto Dur√°n and Thomas Hearns, before he lost to Sugar Ray Leonard in another controversial judges' decision, a split verdict in Leonard's favor. It turned out to be Hagler's final fight. Petronelli trained others who would fight in world title bouts: World Boxing Organization super middleweight champion Steve Collins; Hagler‚Äôs brother, United States Boxing Association middleweight champion Robbie Sims, who lost to Sumbu Kalambay in 1988 for the WBA championship; and Malawian light heavyweight Drake Thadzi, who lost to Virgil Hill in a WBA title bout in 1995. Petronelli also trained his brother‚Äôs son, Tony, who won the North American Boxing Federation light welterweight title in 1976; New England super featherweight champion Mike Cappiello; Massachusetts middleweight champion Mike Culbert; and Kevin McBride, whose TKO victory ended Mike Tyson‚Äôs career in 2006. They also worked with heavyweight Peter McNeeley early in his career. The Petronelli gym was located on Ward Street in Brockton, which the city renamed Petronelli Way in 1999. The city of Brockton honored the Petronelli brothers with the Historic Citizens Award in 2007.Pat Petronelli, 89; trainer had marvelous way with Hagler, many others, Boston Globe, 10 September 2011 (accessed 2 February 2012) Tony Petronelli took over operating the Brockton gym, which closed in 2011. Tony relocated it to nearby Stoughton under the name Big East Boxing. Death Petronelli died 29 January 2012 in Bourne, Massachusetts of natural causes at age 88. His death came just months after the losses of his brother Pat, who died at age 89 from complications of a stroke on 2 September 2011, and Petronelli's wife of 67 years, Marian (Gorman) Petronelli, who died 15 October 2011 at age 84.Obituary for Marian J.

It formed part of a period of renewed anti-Jewish violence in Poland in the aftermath of World War II. Rumors spread that Jews in the city had killed up to 80 children over the course of weeks, which led to violence against them in the Kazimierz quarter of the city and the burning of the Kupa Synagogue. At least one person was killed and an unknown number were injured. Background Around 68,000 to 80,000 Jews lived in Krak√≥w before the September 1939 German invasion of Poland. Because of the Holocaust and further migration following the arrival of the Soviet Red Army, only 2,000 Jewish prewar inhabitants of the city were still present after January 1945. Many Jewish refugees returned to Krak√≥w from the Soviet Union, including those who came from the neighbouring villages and towns. By May 1945, the number of Jews in the city reached 6,637. The return of the Jewish population was not always welcomed, especially by the antisemitic elements in the populace. Anti-Jewish violence in Krak√≥w was becoming a serious problem according to the Soviet-installed starosta in the city, even though \\"no serious antisemitic events were recorded in the rural and small-town regions.\\" In his report for 1‚Äì10 August, the Krak√≥w city administrator (starosta grodzki) noted the \\"insufficient supply of food.\\" In June 1945, the new communist voivode of Krak√≥w described in his report alleged growing tensions to his superiors.  Unrest  On June 27, 1945, a Jewish woman was brought to a local Milicja Obywatelska police station and falsely accused of attempting to abduct a child. Despite the fact that the investigation revealed that the mother had left her child in the care of the suspect, rumours started to spread that a Jewish woman abducted a child in order to kill it. A mob shouting anti-Jewish slogans gathered at Kleparski square, but a Milicja detachment brought the situation under control. Blood libel rumours continued to spread. False claims that thirteen corpses of Christian children had been discovered were disseminated. By 11 August, the number of rumoured \\"victims\\" had grown to eighty. Groups of hooligans who gathered at Kleparski Square had been throwing stones at the Kupa Synagogue on a weekly basis. On 11 August an attempt to seize a thirteen-year-old boy who was throwing stones at the synagogue was made, but he escaped and rushed to the nearby marketplace screaming \\"Help me, the Jews have tried to kill me.\\"Marcin Zaremba Psychoza we krwi . Polityka 05.07.2006 reprint in Onet.pl Instantly the crowd broke into the Kupa synagogue and started beating Jews, who had been praying at the Saturday morning Shabbat service, and the Torah scrolls were burned. The Jewish hostel was also attacked. Jewish men, women, and children, were beaten up on the streets; their homes were broken into and robbed. Some Jews wounded during the pogrom were hospitalized and later were beaten in the hospitals again. One of the pogrom victims witnessed: During the pogrom some Poles, mistaken for Jews, were also attacked. The centre of these events was Miodowa, Starowislna, Przemyska, and Jozefa Streets in the Kazimierz quarter. The riots were most intense between 11 am and 1 pm, calming down around 2 pm, only to regain strength in the late afternoon when the Kupa synagogue was set on fire. Polish policemen and soldiers actively participated in these events. Among twenty-five of those accused of inciting racial hatred, robberies, and violence against Jews, twelve were officers. According to the report prepared for Joseph Stalin by the NKVD in Krak√≥w, it was Polish militiamen who sanctioned the violence.

It was founded by Americans and describes its mission as entailing working \\"with journalists to increase the public's understanding about the socio-economic, political and cultural aspects of Palestine, Palestinians and Palestinian Americans.\\" The Institute for Middle East Understanding (IMEU) is an independent non-profit organization that provides journalists with quick access to information about Palestine and the Palestinians, as well as expert sources, both in the United States and in the Middle East. Both through its website and its staff, the IMEU works with journalists to increase the public's understanding about the socio-economic, political and cultural aspects of Palestine, Palestinians and Palestinian Americans. The IMEU assists journalists who are working on stories about Palestine or the Palestinians by: * Providing access to the latest news stories, expert analysis, photographs and other visuals * Maintaining an updated panel of credible experts and analysts who can comment publicly on the news, life and culture of Palestinians and Palestinian Americans. * Putting journalists in contact with Palestinian women and men from all walks of life - including artists, poets, businesspeople, medical professionals, policymakers and more - who are willing to be interviewed. * Compiling an extensive library of images, maps, studies, reports and polls relating to Palestine and the Palestinians * Providing a comprehensive set of answers to the most commonly asked questions about Palestine and the Palestinians * Supplying links to websites and other online materials that offer journalists a wide range of information on the Palestinian experience. The IMEU provides these links as a service to journalists but it does not necessarily endorse the views or opinions of the various sources. The IMEU was founded in 2005 by a group of concerned Americans who want to foster an increased understanding among Americans about Palestine and the Palestinians. The IMEU is an independent organization and is not affiliated with any government or political party. It is funded through individual donations and foundations. In 2006 it received a grant from the Jerusalem Fund for Education and Community Development which was used to undertake the first compilation of profiles of prominent Palestinian-Americans in the fields of the arts, literature, academia, business and community service, which were then disseminated to news media and on the Internet As an example, the IMEU sent a letter to news outlets in November 2007 that provided the names and profiles of Palestinian-Americans who could be contacted to discuss the upcoming Annapolis conference.

Grafing bei M√ºnchen lies only 7 km away, Ebersberg is 11 km away, Wasserburg am Inn 23 km and Rosenheim 20 km. However, there is no connection to any main highway in the A√üling area. A√üling also holds two rural areas (), A√üling and Loitersdorf. History A√üling had its first documentary mention, as Azzalinga, on 18 September 778. The place belonged to the of Munich and the Court of Swabia of the Electorate of Bavaria. A√üling was the seat of a captaincy (), a historical form of administration. The community in its current form came into being in 1818 with the constituent communities of Adelpolt, Ametsbichl, A√üling, Ast, Bichl, Haar, Holzen, L√§ngholz, Langkofen, Marterm√ºhle, Niclasreuth, Obst√§dt, Osterwald, P√∂rsdorf, P√ºrzelberg, Rammel, Sixtenreit, Sonnenreit, Steinkirchen, Stelzenreit, Tegernau, Thaldorf and Wollwies. In 1978, as part of administrative reform, the formerly separate community of Loitersdorf was amalgamated with A√üling along with its constituent communities of Dorfen, Hochreit, Lorenzenberg, Loitersdorf, Obereichhofen, Untereichhofen, Pfadendorf, Hainza, Pausm√ºhle, Setzerm√ºhle and Siglm√ºhle.

ANSA is a not-for-profit cooperative, whose members and owners are 36 leading news organizations in Italy. Its mission is the distribution of fair and objective news reporting. History In January 1945, three representatives of the major political forces of the Italian Resistance, Giuseppe Liverani, managing director of \\"Il Popolo\\" (The People), Primo Parrini, managing director of Avanti!, and Amerigo Terenzi, CEO of L'Unit√†, advanced the possibility to organize a news agency as a cooperative of newspapers, not controlled by the government nor private groups, replacing the work of the Agenzia Stefani, moved to Milan to meet the information needs of the Italian Social Republic. Their proposal had the approval from the Allied military authorities who, a few months later, favored the success of the new agency by closing the Italian Notizie Nazioni Unite (NNU, United Nations News), an agency created by Psychological Warfare Division. Some antifascist newspapers immediately adhered, and a makeshift headquarters was set up in Rome, at 15 Moretto Street, unofficially entrusting the direction of former NNU director Renato Mieli. ANSA's first publication came on 15 January 1945, in the form of a news release and distributed in the city of Rome. After a few weeks ANSA moved to the place formerly occupied by Agenzia Stefani, on Via di Propaganda. Profile The ANSA is a cooperative of 36 members of the main Italian newspapers publishers and is designed to collect and transmit information on the main events Italian and world. To this end, the ANSA has 22 offices in Italy and 81 offices in 78 other countries. It headquartered in Rome, in Via della Dataria, 94. The agencies ANSA transmit more than 3,500 news and more than 1,500 photos a day that are transmitted to the Italian media, national institutions, local and international trade associations, political parties and trade unions. The ANSA news broadcasts national, local and sector-specific. In addition to the news in Italian ANSA transmits its news in English, Spanish, German, Portuguese and Arabic. Since 1996 the ANSA was the first agency in Italy to spread news via SMS. From 1985 to 1994 as President of ANSA he was covered by journalist Giovanni Giovannini. From 1997 to 2009, , a diplomat, was president of ANSA. Since 2003, the Ansa through AnsaMed provides a news service covering the countries of the Mediterranean basin. Since 2009, the new president is Giulio Anselmi, former director of the ANSA from 1997 to 1999. On 10 June, Luigi Contu has been appointed managing director of the agency.

RIF is part of the infrastructure for the semantic web, along with (principally) SPARQL, RDF and OWL. Although originally envisioned by many as a \\"rules layer\\" for the semantic web, in reality the design of RIF is based on the observation that there are many \\"rules languages\\" in existence, and what is needed is to exchange rules between them.Kifer, Michael (2008). \\"Rule Interchange Format: The Framework\\". in: Web Reasoning and Rule Systems. Lecture Notes in Computer Science RIF includes three dialects, a Core dialect which is extended into a Basic Logic Dialect (BLD) and Production Rule Dialect (PRD).RIF Overview  History  The RIF working group was chartered in late 2005. Among its goals was drawing in members of the commercial rules marketplace. The working group started with more than 50 members and two chairs drawn from industry, Christian de Sainte Marie of ILOG, and Chris Welty of IBM. The charter, to develop an interchange format between existing rule systems was influenced by a workshop in the spring of 2005 in which it was clear that one rule language would not serve the needs of all interested parties (Dr. Welty described the outcome of the workshop as Nash EquilibriumWelty, Chris (2009). \\"Rule Interchange Format\\". Invited presentation to the NY Semantic Web Meetup.). RIF became a W3C Recommendation on June 22, 2010.RIF Core Dialect  Rules and Rule Systems  A rule is perhaps one of the simplest notions in computer science: it is an IF - THEN construct. If some condition (the IF part) that is checkable in some dataset holds, then the conclusion (the THEN part) is processed. Deriving somewhat from its roots in logic, rule systems use a notion of predicates that hold or not of some data object or objects. For example, the fact that two people are married might be represented with predicates as MARRIED(LISA,JOHN). MARRIED is a predicate that can be said to hold between LISA and JOHN. Adding the notion of variables, a rule could be something like: IF MARRIED(?x, ?y) THEN LOVES(?x, ?y) We would expect that for every pair of ?x and ?y (e.g. LISA and JOHN) for which the MARRIED predicate holds, some computer system that could understand this rule would conclude that the LOVES predicate holds for that pair as well. Rules are a simple way of encoding knowledge, and are a drastic simplification of first order logic, for which it is relatively easy to implement inference engines that can process the conditions and draw the right conclusions. A rule system is an implementation of a particular syntax and semantics of rules, which may extend the simple notion described above to include existential quantification, disjunction, logical conjunction, negation, functions, non monotonicity, and many other features. Rule systems have been implemented and studied since the mid-1970s and saw significant uptake in the 1980s during the height of so- called Expert Systems. Standard RIF Dialects The standard RIF dialects are Core, BLD and PRD. These dialects depend on an extensive list of datatypes with builtin functions and predicates on those datatypes. Relations of various RIF dialects are shown in the following Venn diagram.RIF Use Cases and Requirements DTB Datatypes and Built-Ins (DTB) specifies a list of datatypes, built-in functions and built-in predicates expected to be supported by RIF dialects. Some of the datatypes are adapted from XML Schema Datatypes,XML Schema Datatypes XPath functionsXPath-Functions and rdf:PlainLiteral functions.rdf:PlainLiteral: A Datatype for RDF Plain Literals Core The Core dialect comprises a common subset of most rule dialect. RIF-Core is a subset of both RIF-BLD and RIF-PRD. FLD Framework for Logic Dialects (FLD) describes mechanisms for specifying the syntax and semantics of logic RIF dialects, including the RIF-BLD and RIF-Core, but not RIF-PRD which is not a logic-based RIF dialect. BLD The Basic Logic Dialect (BLD) adds features to the Core dialect that are not directly available such as: logic functions, equality in the then-part and named arguments. RIF BLD corresponds to positive datalogs, that is, logic programs without functions or negations. RIF-BLD has a model-theoretic semantics. The frame syntax of RIF BLD is based on F-logic, but RIF BLD doesn't have the non- monotonic reasoning features of F-logic. PRD The Production Rules Dialect (PRD) can be used to model production rules. Features that are notably in PRD but not BLD include negation and retraction of facts (thus, PRD is not monotonic). PRD rules are order dependent, hence conflict resolution strategies are needed when multiple rules can be fired. The PRD specification defines one such resolution strategy based on forward chaining reasoning. RIF- PRD has an operational semantics, whereas the condition formulas also have a model-theoretic semantics. Example (Example 1.2 in RIF-PRD specification) Prefix(ex ) (* ex:rule_1 *) Forall ?customer ?purchasesYTD ( If And( ?customer#ex:Customer ?customer[ex:purchasesYTD->?purchasesYTD] External(pred:numeric-greater-than(?purchasesYTD 5000)) ) Then Do( Modify(?customer[ex:status->\\"Gold\\"]) ) ) Non-standard RIF Dialects Several other RIF dialects exist. None of them are officially endorsed by W3C and they are not part of the RIF specification. CASPD The Core Answer Set Programming Dialect (CASPD)RIF Core Answer Set Programming Dialect is based on answer set programming, that is, declarative logic programming based on the answer set semantics (stable model semantics). Example: Document( Prefix(ex ) Group ( Forall ?S ( ex:afraid(?S ex:Math) :- And ( ?S#ex:Student (Naf Neg ex:afraid(?S ex:Math)) ) ) Forall ?S ( Neg ex:afraid(?S ex:Math) :- And ( ?S#ex:Student ?S[ex:majors -> ex:Math] ) ) ) URD The Uncertainty Rule Dialect (URD)Zhao & Boley. Uncertainty Treatment in the Rule Interchange Format: From Encoding to Extension. In The 4th International Workshop on Uncertainty Reasoning for the Semantic Web (URSW), 2008. supports a direct representation of uncertain knowledge. Example: Document( Import () Group ( Forall ?x ?y( cheapFlight(?x ?y) :- affordableFlight(?x ?y) ) / 0.4 Forall ?x ?y(affordableFlight(?x ?y)) / left_shoulder0k4k1k3k(?y) ) ) SILK RIF-SILKRIF SILK dialect can be used to model default logic. It is based on declarative logic programming with the well-founded semantics. RIF- SILK also includes a number of other features present in more sophisticated declarative logic programming languages such as SILK.The SILK Language, Benjamin Grosof, Michael Kifer, Mike Dean.

Its name is probably derived from the German Ram (crow) and Stein (stone) and signifies 'rock of the crow'. The Ch√¢teau de Ramstein is built on the same crest as the Ch√¢teau de l'Ortenbourg. Standing at an altitude of 384 m, it is dominated by the Ch√¢teau de l'Ortenbourg from which it is separated by a few hundred metres. It was built around 1293 as a rear base during the siege of Ch√¢teau de l'Ortenbourg by Otto von Ochenstein, during the conflict between Adolf of Nassau and Albert of Habsburg. Originally built as a simple tower to support a siege engine, it grew at the start of the 14th century into a true castle with the strengthening of the tower and an extra wall. In 1421, it was attacked and pillaged by Strasbourg. It was destroyed in 1633 by the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War. At the start of the 19th century it became the property of baron Mathieu de Fabvier, who also owned Ortenbourg. Today, all that remains are the exterior wall and two turrets, built of granite. Because of the risk of landslides, the castle has been closed to visitors since 1983. The castle has been listed as monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture since 1924.

Located between Hadleigh and Lavenham, in 2005 it had a population of 180 reducing to 174 at the 2011 Census. According to Eilert Ekwall the possible meaning of the village name is Ilega's meadow, which was burnt before 1254. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book, at which time it and neighbouring Monks Eleigh had a population of 61. The male population was 83, and female population was 91 according to the 2011 census.  History  In the 1870s, Brent Eleigh was described as: > The church shows Norman features, has a later English tower, and is good; > and there are charities ¬£90. A market was formerly held in the parish. As well as the possible meaning of the village name, Brent Eleigh, derives from brende, meaning burnt in Middle English, and the Old English word lƒìah, meaning a forest. The village was not only a market town under the reign of Henry III, but also one of the 'cloth villages', where Lavenham merchants had wool spun for them. St Mary's Church revealed a remarkable wall of 14th century paintings in 1961, and the act of the repairs that were to be taken place, created an important feature in Suffolk, and a landmark in the village. Brent Eleigh Manor was originally owned by the Illeigh/Ely family, then taken over by the Shelton family in the 13th Century till the 16th/17th Century.left  Occupation  The occupational structure in 1881 was somewhat different to what it is now. A large number of females occupation was unknown, however, more females than men had professional occupations, including subordinate medical service and schoolmaster. Also more females were employed in domestic offices or services. In 1881, Brent Eleigh relied heavily on the agriculture sector as a main source of income. Brent Eleigh's rural location is a reason for the reliance on the agricultural sector. In 1831, the population in the village was 290, and 51 of the residents were labourers and servants, which was the most common occupation, due to the basic skills needed compared to that of a professional, such as a headmaster. In the 2011 census, the sector of occupation that most people were employed as were Managers, Directors and Senior Officials, with 23 people. On the whole, 79 residents aged 16 to 74 were in employment in Brent Eleigh in 2011. There were 34 females and 45 males in employment between the ages of 16 and 74. Compared to the occupations in 1881, more females are involved in occupations such as Manager, director and senior official roles, instead of domestic services and servants like in 1881. 325x325px  Population  Brent Eleigh is a small village, therefore the population has never been large; however, in 1801, there were 243 residents compared to 174 in the last census in 2011. The population has fluctuated over the past couple of centuries, peaking at 298 in 1821 and being at its lowest in 1961 with 134 residents. Between 1911 and 1921, the population fell from 223 to 168, and in this period was World War I, demonstrating one cause for the rapid fall in locals. High population growth, by the 1970s, had spread to East Anglia, where the county of Suffolk is located.  Geography  Brent Eleigh is situated along the A1141 as well as the River Brett, which runs towards surrounding settlements such as Chelsworth. Comparing a map of the area from 1885‚Äì1886 and a map from 1974‚Äì1978 has resulted in slight differences, for example slightly more housing, however on the whole, the village has not undergone any significant changes, keeping it as an old traditional English rural village. 20th Century map of Brent Eleigh including neighbouring areas  Transport  Brent Eleigh's rural location determines the accessibility of public services. The nearest railway station is Sudbury which is 6.96 miles (11.20 km) away. Vehicle ownership is high compared to the population of village, with 125 cars and vans registered in the area. The isolation of the village, with a lack of public transport close by is one reason behind high vehicle ownership. The bus service goes from Hadleigh to Sudbury, stopping at Brent Eleigh, however the service is not frequent, therefore cannot be relied upon at certain times and certain days. Places of interest= Brent Eleigh Hall  Brent Eleigh Hall's early history is unknown; however, its appearance now is Georgian. Sir Edwin Lutyens produced the impressive door case in 1933‚Äì34, which is one feature that makes the hall a place of interest, and adds to its history. > Within the grounds is a beautiful Victorian walled kitchen garden spread > over nearly two acres, which requires resuscitation. The Hall lies to the north of the village, close to St Mary's Church, and is a listed building. The portrait of Richard Colman was at Brent Eleigh Hall but was later passed to the Tate in 1997. The Colman line ended in 1739, and the Hall was taken over by the Goates, then later the Browns. The estate was sold in 1922 to the Barran family. During the Second War the hall was lived in by Sir Connop Guthrie Bt and family, who is commemorated on a plaque in the church. The US Air Force were at Lavenham Airifeld and used the Hall as a popular way mark, it being a distinctive colour, known as the Perpermint Palace. Sir David Barran was Chairman of Shell UK, and it is said the Brent Oil Field is named after Brent Eleigh. Following the death of Lady Barran, it became empty until 2015, and since subject of major restoration.left  St Mary's Church  This 13th-century church has not had as big of an impression as people first expected, when the 14th-century paintings were first discovered, and is not known widely for its significant and impressive features. > In the centre is the crucifixion, at once a delightful example of medieval > folk art, and yet also one of the most powerful medieval images in the > Suffolk canon. The Harrowing of Hell is placed beside the crucifixion, an image that is usually associated with Orthodox churches. The memorial of Edward Colman, a family member who owned Brent Eleigh Hall, is located in the chancel. St Mary's church is situated on Hall Road, off of the A1141 main road and is externally decorated, expressing its Victorian window to the east and the sanctuary contains \\"the three-sided communion rails\\", which there are only a few of in East Anglia. The church being open for visitors, sadly led to the vandalism of the wall paintings in late 2016, but they have happily since been restored by one of the UK‚Äôs top conservation specialists.

Prior to his election to the episcopacy, Rev. Martinez gained notability as a Pastor and District Superintendent in the Methodist and United Methodist Churches and as a denominational official in the area of ethnic ministries. Birth and family Martinez was born 3 February 1940 in Seguin, Texas. He was the eldest of four children born to Guadalupe and Dora Martinez. Martinez is a grandson of sharecropper farmers who came to the United States at the end of the nineteenth century. Martinez was baptized at the Iglesia Metodista Unida La Trinidad, where his parents are still active members. Martinez met Raquel Mora while in college in El Paso, Texas. They were married 9 June 1961. She was born in Allende, Coahuila, Mexico, where her father was a Methodist pastor. The Mora family came to the United States when Raquel was twelve years old. Joel and Raquel have three children: Patricia, John and Rebeca. Education Martinez earned the B.A. degree in History from the University of Texas at El Paso in 1961. His wife attended the Lydia Patterson Institute in El Paso at the same time. Martinez went on to graduate from the Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas in 1965, earning the M.Div. degree. Martinez received the Distinguished Alumni Award from Perkins in 1995. He also was honored with the honorary degree D.D. by Nebraska Wesleyan University in 1993. His wife has a degree in Music Education from UTEP and a Master of Sacred Music degree from Perkins. Ordained ministry Martinez was ordained a Deacon in the Rio Grande Annual Conference of The Methodist Church in 1962. He was ordained Elder in 1965. Bishop Paul E. Martin presided at both ordinations. . Martinez served the following appointments as Pastor: El Buen Methodist Church, Dallas, Texas (1965‚Äì70) and the Emanuel Church, El Paso, Texas (1970‚Äì79). From 1973 until 1975 he also served as the Director of Planning and Development for the Newark-Houchen Center in El Paso. In 1975 Martinez was appointed the Executive Secretary of the Office of Ethnic and Language Ministries of the National Division of the General Board of Global Ministries of the U.M. Church, serving in this capacity until 1981. He was then appointed Superintendent of the Northern District of the Rio Grande Annual Conference of the U.M. Church, with headquarters in San Antonio, Texas (1981‚Äì87). His last appointment before election to the Episcopacy was as Pastor of the Emanu-El Church in Dallas (1987‚Äì92). Service to the United Methodist Church Prior to his election to the episcopacy, Martinez gave leadership to many areas of the worldwide United Methodist Church. He was a member of the General Council on Ministries (1984‚Äì88), and of the World Methodist Council (1986‚Äì91). He was elected a Delegate to the South Central Jurisdictional Conference in 1984, and to the U.M. General Conference in 1988 and 1992. He also represented the church as a Delegate to the Seventh Assembly of the World Council of Churches, 1991 in Canberra, Australia. He also served as Chairperson, Division of Human Relations, U.M. General Board of Church and Society (1972‚Äì75). Involvement in labor and ethnic issues From early exposure to the plight of farm workers, and later in student ministry to migrant workers, Martinez learned to appreciate the urgent need for poor people to organize themselves in order to participate more equitably in society. He worked with Cesar Chavez during the 1970s. He worked to establish the first federally funded health clinic for the poor of El Paso. Martinez also was a founding member of the National Hispanic Caucus in the U.M. Church in 1970. He also supported the organizing of poor fishermen on the island of Puerto Rico in the late 1970s. Martinez worked on the initial proposals to the 1976 U.M. General Conference for a Missional Priority on the Ethnic Minority Local Church. He served on the Ethnic Minority Local Church Inter-Agency Committee on the Missional Priority (1976‚Äì80). He later chaired the National Missional Priority Coordinating Committee during the 1984-88 quadrennium. During the 1988-92 quadrennium, he served as Secretary of the National Committee to Develop a Plan for Hispanic Ministry, and was President of the National Hispanic Caucus (1987‚Äì90). Ecumenical ministry Martinez has always worked ecumenically in his ministry. For example, he served as the President of the Greater Dallas Community of Churches in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He also was a delegate to the Seventh Assembly of the World Council of Churches, Canberra, Australia in 1991. He was a member of the Finance Committee of the National Council of Churches in the U.S.A. (1979‚Äì80). He was also a member of the Board of Directors of the Seminaro Evangelico of Puerto Rico (1975‚Äì81). Episcopal ministry Martinez was elected and consecrated a Bishop of the United Methodist Church by the 1992 South Central Jurisdictional Conference. He was assigned the Nebraska episcopal area (the Nebraska Annual Conference). In 2000 Martinez was assigned the San Antonio Episcopal Area (the Rio Grande and Southwest Texas Annual Conferences). One of Martinez's interests is fostering closer relationships between the U.M.C. and the Churches of Latin America and the Caribbean. Another goal is to visit Asia, and travel more extensively in Africa and Latin America. Martinez also writes church history with an emphasis on the contributions of Hispanics to the ecumenical church.

Florentine painting or the Florentine School refers to artists in, from, or influenced by the naturalistic style developed in Florence in the 14th century, largely through the efforts of Giotto di Bondone, and in the 15th century the leading school of Western painting. Some of the best known painters of the earlier Florentine School are Fra Angelico, Botticelli, Filippo Lippi, the Ghirlandaio family, Masolino, and Masaccio. Florence was the birthplace of the High Renaissance, but in the early 16th century the most important artists, including Michelangelo and Raphael were attracted to Rome, where the largest commissions then were. In part this was following the Medici, some of whom became cardinals and even the pope. A similar process affected later Florentine artists. By the Baroque period, the many painters working in Florence were rarely major figures. Before 1400 Mosaic ceiling of the Baptistery of St John in Florence, dating from around 1225. The earliest distinctive Tuscan art, produced in the 13th century in Pisa and Lucca, formed the basis for later development. Nicola Pisano showed his appreciation of Classical forms as did his son, Giovanni Pisano, who carried the new ideas of Gothic sculpture into the Tuscan vernacular, forming figures of unprecedented naturalism. This was echoed in the work of Pisan painters in the 12th and 13th centuries, notably that of Giunta Pisano, who in turn influenced such greats as Cimabue, and through him Giotto and the early 14th- century Florentine artists. The oldest extant large scale Florentine pictorial project is the mosaic decoration of the interior of the dome of the Baptistery of St John, which began around 1225. Although Venentian artists were involved in the project, the Tuscan artists created expressive, lively scenes, showing emotional content unlike the prevailing Byzantine tradition. Coppo di Marcovaldo is said to have been responsible for the central figure of Christ and is the earliest Florentine artist involved in the project. Like the panels of the Virgin and Child painted for the Servite churches in Siena and Orvieto, sometimes attributed to Coppo, the Christ figure has a sense of volume. Similar works were commissioned for the Florentine churches of Santa Maria Novella, Santa Trinita and Ognissanti in the late 13th century and early 14th century. Duccio's panel of around 1285, Madonna with Child enthroned and six Angels or Rucellai Madonna, for the Santa Maria Novella, now in the Ufizi Gallery, shows a development of the naturalistic space and form, and may not have been originally intended as altarpieces. Panels of the Virgin were used at top of rood screens, as at the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi, which has the panel in the fresco of the Verification of the Stigmata in the Life of Saint Francis cycle. Cimabue's Madonna of Santa Trinita and Duccio's Rucellai Madonna do, however, retain the earlier stylism of showing light on drapery as a network of lines. Giotto's fresco, the Mourning of St. Francis in the Bardi chapel of Santa Croce. Giotto's sense of light would have been influenced by the frescoes he had seen while working in Rome, and in his narrative wall paintings, particularly those commissioned by the Bardi family, his figures are placed in naturalistic space and possess dimension and dramatic expression. A similar approach to light was used by his contemporaries such as Bernardo Daddi, their attention to naturalism was encouraged by the subjects commissioned for 14th-century Franciscan and Dominican churches, and was to influence Florentine painters in the following centuries. While some were traditional compositions such as those dealing with the order's founder and early saints, others, such as scenes of recent events, people and places, had no precedent, allowing for invention. The 13th century witnessed an increase in demand for religious panel painting, particularly altarpieces, although the reason for this is obscure, early 14th-century Tuscan painters and woodworkers created altarpieces which were more elaborate, multipanelled pieces with complex framing. Contracts of the time note that clients often had a woodwork shape in mind when commissioning an artist, and discussed the religious figures to be depicted with the artists. The content of the narrative scenes in predella panels however are rarely mentioned in the contracts and may have been left to the artists concerned. Florentine churches commissioned many Sienese artists to create altar pieces, such as Ugolino di Nerio, who was asked to paint a large scale work for the altar for the Basilica di Santa Croce, which may have been the earliest polyptych on a Florentine altar. The guilds, cognizant of the stimulus that external craftmanship brought, made it easy for artists from other areas to work in Florence. Sculptors had their own guild which held minor status, and by 1316 painters were members of the influential Arte dei Medici e Speziali. The guilds themselves became significant patrons of art and from the early 14th century various major guilds oversaw the upkeep and improvement of individual religious buildings; all the guilds were involved in the restoration of Orsanmichele. The naturalism developed by the early Florentine artists waned during the third quarter of the 14th century, likely as a consequence of the plague. Major commissions, such as the altarpiece for the Strozzi family (dating from around 1354-57) in Santa Maria Novella, were entrusted to Andrea di Cione, whose work, and in that of his brothers, are more iconic in their treatment of figures and have an earlier sense of compressed space. Early Renaissance, after 1400 Florence continued to be the most important centre of Italian Renaissance painting. The earliest truly Renaissance images in Florence date from 1401, the first year of the century known in Italian as Quattrocento, synonymous with the Early Renaissance; however, they are not paintings. At that date a competition was held to find an artist to create a pair of bronze doors for the Baptistry of St. John, the oldest remaining church in the city. The Baptistry is a large octagonal building in the Romanesque style. The interior of its dome is decorated with an enormous mosaic figure of Christ in Majesty thought to have been designed by Coppo di Marcovaldo. It has three large portals, the central one being filled at that time by a set of doors created by Andrea Pisano eighty years earlier. Pisano's doors were divided into 28 quatrefoil compartments, containing narratives scenes from the Life of John the Baptist. The competitors, of which there were seven young artists, were each to design a bronze panel of similar shape and size, representing the Sacrifice of Isaac. Two of the panels have survived, that by Lorenzo Ghiberti and that by Brunelleschi. Each panel shows some strongly classicising motifs indicating the direction that art and philosophy were moving, at that time. Ghiberti has used the naked figure of Isaac to create a small sculpture in the Classical style. He kneels on a tomb decorated with acanthus scrolls that are also a reference to the art of Ancient Rome. In Brunelleschi's panel, one of the additional figures included in the scene is reminiscent of a well-known Roman bronze figure of a boy pulling a thorn from his foot. Brunelleschi's creation is challenging in its dynamic intensity. Less elegant than Ghiberti's, it is more about human drama and impending tragedy.R.E. Wolf and R. Millen, Renaissance and Mannerist Art, (1968) Ghiberti won the competition. His first set of Baptistry doors took 27 years to complete, after which he was commissioned to make another. In the total of 50 years that Ghiberti worked on them, the doors provided a training ground for many of the artists of Florence. Being narrative in subject and employing not only skill in arranging figurative compositions but also the burgeoning skill of linear perspective, the doors were to have an enormous influence on the development of Florentine pictorial art. They were a unifying factor, a source of pride and camaraderie for both the city and its artists. Michelangelo was to call them the Gates of Paradise. Brancacci Chapel In 1426 two artists commenced painting a fresco cycle of the Life of St. Peter in the chapel of the Brancacci family, at the Carmelite Church in Florence. They both were called by the name of Tommaso and were nicknamed Masaccio and Masolino, Slovenly Tom and Little Tom. More than any other artist, Masaccio recognized the implications in the work of Giotto. He carried forward the practice of painting from nature. His paintings demonstrate an understanding of anatomy, of foreshortening, of linear perspective, of light and the study of drapery. Among his works, the figures of Adam and Eve being expelled from Eden, painted on the side of the arch into the chapel, are renowned for their realistic depiction of the human form and of human emotion. They contrast with the gentle and pretty figures painted by Masolino on the opposite side of Adam and Eve receiving the forbidden fruit. The painting of the Brancacci Chapel was left incomplete when Masaccio died at 26. The work was later finished by Filippino Lippi. Masaccio's work became a source of inspiration to many later painters, including Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo.Ornella Casazza, Masaccio and the Brancacci Chapel, (1990) Development of linear perspective alt=Fresco. A scene in muted colours showing the porch of a temple, with a steep flight of steps. The Virgin Mary, as a small child and encouraged by her parents, is walking up the steps towards the High Priest. During the first half of the 15th century, the achieving of the effect of realistic space in a painting by the employment of linear perspective was a major preoccupation of many painters, as well as the architects Brunelleschi and Alberti who both theorised about the subject. Brunelleschi is known to have done a number of careful studies of the piazza and octagonal baptistery outside Florence Cathedral and it is thought he aided Masaccio in the creation of his famous trompe l'oeil niche around the Holy Trinity he painted at Santa Maria Novella. According to Vasari, Paolo Uccello was so obsessed with perspective that he thought of little else and experimented with it in many paintings, the best known being the three Battle of San Romano pictures which use broken weapons on the ground, and fields on the distant hills to give an impression of perspective. In the 1450s Piero della Francesca, in paintings such as The Flagellation of Christ, demonstrated his mastery over linear perspective and also over the science of light. Another painting exists, a cityscape, by an unknown artist, perhaps Piero della Francesca, that demonstrates the sort of experiment that Brunelleschi had been making. From this time linear perspective was understood and regularly employed, such as by Perugino in his Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter in the Sistine Chapel. The Flagellation demonstrates the artist's control over both perspective and light. alt= Rectangular panel painting. The composition is divided in two, with an interior scene and an exterior scene. To the left, the pale, brightly lit figure of Jesus stands tied to a column while a man whips him. The ruler sits to the left on a throne. The building is Ancient Roman in style. To the right, two richly dressed men and a barefooted youth stand in a courtyard, much closer to the viewer, so appearing larger. Understanding of light Giotto used tonality to create form. Taddeo Gaddi in his nocturnal scene in the Baroncelli Chapel demonstrated how light could be used to create drama. Paolo Uccello, a hundred years later, experimented with the dramatic effect of light in some of his almost monochrome frescoes. He did a number of these in terra verde or \\"green earth\\", enlivening his compositions with touches of vermilion. The best known is his equestrian portrait of John Hawkwood on the wall of Florence Cathedral. Both here and on the four heads of prophets that he painted around the inner clockface in the cathedral, he used strongly contrasting tones, suggesting that each figure was being lit by a natural light source, as if the source was an actual window in the cathedral.Annarita Paolieri, Paolo Uccello, Domenico Veneziano, Andrea del Castagno, (1991) Piero della Francesca carried his study of light further. In the Flagellation he demonstrates a knowledge of how light is proportionally disseminated from its point of origin. There are two sources of light in this painting, one internal to a building and the other external. Of the internal source, though the light itself is invisible, its position can be calculated with mathematical certainty. Leonardo da Vinci was to carry forward Piero's work on light.Peter Murray and Pier Luigi Vecchi, Piero della Francesca, (1967) The Madonna One of several Annunciations by Fra Angelico, Prado The Blessed Virgin Mary, revered by the Catholic Church worldwide, was particularly evoked in Florence, where there was a miraculous image of her on a column in the corn market and where both the Cathedral of \\"Our Lady of the Flowers\\" and the large Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella were named in her honour. The miraculous image in the corn market was destroyed by fire, but replaced with a new image in the 1330s by Bernardo Daddi, set in an elaborately designed and lavishly wrought canopy by Orcagna. The open lower storey of the building was enclosed and dedicated as Orsanmichele. Depictions of the Madonna and Child were a very popular art form in Florence. They took every shape from small mass-produced terracotta plaques to magnificent altarpieces such as those by Cimabue, Giotto and Masaccio. Small Madonnas for the home were the bread and butter work of most painting workshops, often largely produced by the junior members following a model by the master. Public buildings and government offices also often contained these or other religious paintings. Bartolomeo di Fruosino, 1420, typical verso of a desco da parto, with heraldry and a baby boy urinating Among those who painted devotional Madonnas during the Early Renaissance are Fra Angelico, Fra Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio and Davide Ghirlandaio. Later the leading purveyor was Botticelli and his workshop who produced large numbers of Madonnas for churches, homes, and also public buildings. He introduced a large round tondo format for grand homes. Perugino's Madonnas and saints are known for their sweetness and a number of small Madonnas attributed to Leonardo da Vinci, such as the Benois Madonna, have survived. Even Michelangelo who was primarily a sculptor, was persuaded to paint the Doni Tondo, while for Raphael, they are among his most popular and numerous works. Birthing-trays A Florentine speciality was the round or 12-sided desco da parto or birthing-tray, on which a new mother served sweetmeats to the female friends who visited her after the birth. The rest of the time these seem to have been hung in the bedroom. Both sides are painted, one with scenes to encourage the mother during the pregnancy, often showing a naked male toddler; viewing positive images was believed to promote the outcome depicted. Painting and printmaking From around the mid-century, Florence became Italy's leading centre of the new industry of printmaking, as some of the many Florentine goldsmiths turned to making plates for engravings. They often copied the style of painters, or drawings supplied by them. Botticelli was one of the first to experiment with drawings for book illustrations, in his case of Dante. Antonio del Pollaiolo was a goldsmith as well as a printer, and engraved his Battle of the Nude Men himself; in its size and sophistication this took the Italian print to new levels, and remains one of the most famous prints of the Renaissance. Patronage and Humanism The Birth of Venus for the Medicialt=Large rectangular panel. At the centre, the Goddess Venus, with her thick golden hair curving around her is standing afloat in a large seashell. To the left, two Wind Gods blow her towards the shore where on the right Flora, the spirit of Spring, is about to drape her in a pink robe decorated with flowers. The figures are elongated and serene. The colours are delicate. Gold has been used to highlight the details. In Florence, in the later 15th century, most works of art, even those that were done as decoration for churches, were generally commissioned and paid for by private patrons. Much of the patronage came from the Medici family, or those who were closely associated with or related to them, such as the Sassetti, the Ruccellai and the Tornabuoni. In the 1460s Cosimo de' Medici the Elder had established Marsilio Ficino as his resident Humanist philosopher, and facilitated his translation of Plato and his teaching of Platonic philosophy, which focused on humanity as the centre of the natural universe, on each person's personal relationship with God, and on fraternal or \\"platonic\\" love as being the closest that a person could get to emulating or understanding the love of God.Hugh Ross Williamson, Lorenzo the Magnificent, (1974) In the Medieval period, everything related to the Classical period was perceived as associated with paganism. In the Renaissance it came increasingly to be associated with enlightenment. The figures of Classical mythology began to take on a new symbolic role in Christian art and in particular, the Goddess Venus took on a new discretion. Born fully formed, by a sort of miracle, she was the new Eve, symbol of innocent love, or even, by extension, a symbol of the Virgin Mary herself. We see Venus in both these roles in the two famous tempera paintings that Botticelli did in the 1480s for Cosimo's nephew, Pierfrancesco Medici, the Primavera and the Birth of Venus.Umberto Baldini, Primavera, (1984) Meanwhile, Domenico Ghirlandaio, a meticulous and accurate draughtsman and one of the finest portrait painters of his age, executed two cycles of frescoes for Medici associates in two of Florence's larger churches, the Sassetti Chapel at Santa Trinita and the Tornabuoni Chapel at Santa Maria Novella. In these cycles of the Life of St Francis and the Life of the Virgin Mary and Life of John the Baptist there was room for portraits of patrons and of the patrons' patrons. Thanks to Sassetti's patronage, there is a portrait of the man himself, with his employer, Lorenzo il Magnifico, and Lorenzo's three sons with their tutor, the Humanist poet and philosopher, Agnolo Poliziano. In the Tornabuoni Chapel is another portrait of Poliziano, accompanied by the other influential members of the Platonic Academy including Marsilio Ficino. Flemish influence From about 1450, with the arrival in Italy of the Flemish painter Rogier van der Weyden and possibly earlier, artists were introduced to the medium of oil paint. Whereas both tempera and fresco lent themselves to the depiction of pattern, neither presented a successful way to represent natural textures realistically. The highly flexibly medium of oils, which could be made opaque or transparent, and allowed alteration and additions for days after it had been laid down, opened a new world of possibility to Italian artists. In 1475 a huge altarpiece of the Adoration of the Shepherds arrived in Florence. Painted by Hugo van der Goes at the behest of the Portinari family, it was shipped out from Bruges and installed in the Chapel of Sant' Egidio at the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova. The altarpiece glows with intense reds and greens, contrasting with the glossy black velvet robes of the Portinari donors. In the foreground is a still life of flowers in contrasting containers, one of glazed pottery and the other of glass. The glass vase alone was enough to excite attention. But the most influential aspect of the triptych was the extremely natural and lifelike quality of the three shepherds with stubbly beards, workworn hands and expressions ranging from adoration to wonder to incomprehension. Domenico Ghirlandaio promptly painted his own version, with a beautiful Italian Madonna in place of the long-faced Flemish one, and himself, gesturing theatrically, as one of the shepherds. Papal commission in Rome Christ Giving the Keys to Peteralt=Rectangular fresco. The scene is like Raphael's Marriage of the Virgin, above, which is based on it. There is a similar townscape and circular building in perspective, with an ancient Roman triumphal arch to either side. In the foreground, Jesus gives the keys of Heaven to St Peter, who is kneeling. To the right and left stand the other disciples and some onlookers, who are distinguished by Renaissance clothing. There are many more small figures in the square behind them. In 1477 Pope Sixtus IV replaced the derelict old chapel at the Vatican in which many of the papal services were held. The interior of the new chapel, named the Sistine Chapel in his honour, appears to have been planned from the start to have a series of 16 large frescoes between its pilasters on the middle level, with a series of painted portraits of popes above them. In 1480, a group of artists from Florence was commissioned with the work: Botticelli, Pietro Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Cosimo Rosselli. This fresco cycle was to depict Stories of the Life of Moses on one side of the chapel, and Stories of the Life of Christ on the other with the frescoes complementing each other in theme. The Nativity of Jesus and the Finding of Moses were adjacent on the wall behind the altar, with an altarpiece of the Assumption of the Virgin between them. These paintings, all by Perugino, were later destroyed to paint Michelangelo's Last Judgement. The remaining 12 pictures indicate the virtuosity that these artists had attained, and the obvious cooperation between individuals who normally employed very different styles and skills. The paintings gave full range to their capabilities as they included a great number of figures of men, women and children and characters ranging from guiding angels to enraged Pharaohs and the devil himself. Each painting required a landscape. Because of the scale of the figures that the artists agreed upon, in each picture, the landscape and sky take up the whole upper half of the scene. Sometimes, as in Botticelli's scene of The Purification of the Leper, there are additional small narratives taking place in the landscape, in this case The Temptations of Christ. Perugino's scene of Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter is remarkable for the clarity and simplicity of its composition, the beauty of the figurative painting, which includes a self-portrait among the onlookers, and especially the perspective cityscape which includes reference to Peter's ministry to Rome by the presence of two triumphal arches, and centrally placed an octagonal building that might be a Christian baptistry or a Roman Mausoleum. High Renaissance Florence was the birthplace of the High Renaissance, but in the early 16th century the most important artists were attracted to Rome, where the largest commissions began to be. In part this was following the Medici, some of whom became cardinals and even the pope. Leonardo da Vinci Leonardo, because of the scope of his interests and the extraordinary degree of talent that he demonstrated in so many diverse areas, is regarded as the archetypal \\"Renaissance man\\". But it was first and foremost as a painter that he was admired within his own time, and as a painter, he drew on the knowledge that he gained from all his other interests. alt= Rectangular fresco, in very damaged condition, of the Last Supper. The scene shows a table across a room which has three windows at the rear. At the centre, Jesus sits, stretching out his hands, the left palm up and the right down. Around the table, are the disciples, twelve men of different ages. They are all reacting in surprise or dismay at what Jesus has just said. The different emotional reactions and gestures are portrayed with great naturalism. Leonardo was a scientific observer. He learned by looking at things. He studied and drew the flowers of the fields, the eddies of the river, the form of the rocks and mountains, the way light reflected from foliage and sparkled in a jewel. In particular, he studied the human form, dissecting thirty or more unclaimed cadavers from a hospital in order to understand muscles and sinews. More than any other artist, he advanced the study of \\"atmosphere\\". In his paintings such as the Mona Lisa and Virgin of the Rocks, he used light and shade with such subtlety that, for want of a better word, it became known as Leonardo's \\"sfumato\\" or \\"smoke\\". Simultaneous to inviting the viewer into a mysterious world of shifting shadows, chaotic mountains and whirling torrents, Leonardo achieved a degree of realism in the expression of human emotion, prefigured by Giotto but unknown since Masaccio's Adam and Eve. Leonardo's Last Supper, painted in the refectory of a monastery in Milan, became the benchmark for religious narrative painting for the next half millennium. Many other Renaissance artists painted versions of the Last Supper, but only Leonardo's was destined to be reproduced countless times in wood, alabaster, plaster, lithograph, tapestry, crochet and table-carpets. Apart from the direct impact of the works themselves, Leonardo's studies of light, anatomy, landscape, and human expression were disseminated in part through his generosity to a retinue of students.Giorgio Vasari, Lives of the Artists, (1568), 1965 edition, trans George Bull, Penguin, Michelangelo Michelangelo: alt= Rectangular fresco. God is in the act of creating the first man, who lies languidly on the ground, propped on one elbow, and reaching towards God. God, shown as a dynamic elderly man, is reaching his hand from Heaven to touch Adam and fill him with life. In 1508 Pope Julius II succeeded in getting the sculptor Michelangelo to agree to continue the decorative scheme of the Sistine Chapel. The Sistine Chapel ceiling was constructed in such a way that there were twelve sloping pendentives supporting the vault that formed ideal surfaces on which to paint the Twelve Apostles. Michelangelo, who had yielded to the Pope's demands with little grace, soon devised an entirely different scheme, far more complex both in design and in iconography. The scale of the work, which he executed single handed except for manual assistance, was titanic and took nearly five years to complete. The Pope's plan for the Apostles would thematically have formed a pictorial link between the Old Testament and New Testament narratives on the walls, and the popes in the gallery of portraits. It is the twelve apostles, and their leader Peter as first Bishop of Rome, that make that bridge. But Michelangelo's scheme went the opposite direction. The theme of Michelangelo's ceiling is not God's grand plan for humanity's salvation. The theme is about humanity's disgrace. It is about why humanity and the faith needed Jesus.T.L.Taylor, The Vision of Michelangelo, Sydney University, (1982) Superficially, the ceiling is a Humanist construction. The figures are of superhuman dimension and, in the case of Adam, of such beauty that according to the biographer Vasari, it really looks as if God himself had designed the figure, rather than Michelangelo. But despite the beauty of the individual figures, Michelangelo has not glorified the human state, and he certainly has not presented the Humanist ideal of platonic love. In fact, the ancestors of Christ, which he painted around the upper section of the wall, demonstrate all the worst aspects of family relationships, displaying dysfunction in as many different forms as there are families. Vasari praised Michelangelo's seemingly infinite powers of invention in creating postures for the figures. Raphael, who was given a preview by Bramante after Michelangelo had downed his brush and stormed off to Bologna in a temper, painted at least two figures in imitation of Michelangelo's prophets, one at the church of Sant' Agostino and the other in the Vatican, his portrait of Michelangelo himself in The School of Athens.Gabriel Bartz and Eberhard K√∂nig, Michelangelo, (1998)Ludwig Goldschieder, Michelangelo, (1962) Raphael With Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, Raphael's name is synonymous with the High Renaissance, although he was younger than Michelangelo by 18 years and Leonardo by almost 30. It cannot be said of him that he greatly advanced the state of painting as his two famous contemporaries did. Rather, his work was the culmination of all the developments of the High Renaissance. Raphael: The School of Athens, commissioned by Pope Julius II to decorate a suite now known as the Raphael Rooms in the Vatican Raphael had the good luck to be born the son of a painter, so his career path, unlike that of Michelangelo who was the son of minor nobility, was decided without a quarrel. Some years after his father's death he worked in the Umbrian workshop of Perugino, an excellent painter and a superb technician. His first signed and dated painting, executed at the age of 21, is the Betrothal of the Virgin, which immediately reveals its origins in Perugino's Christ giving the Keys to Peter.Diana Davies, \\"Raphael\\", Harrap's Illustrated Dictionary of Art and Artists, (1990) Raphael was a carefree character who unashamedly drew on the skills of the renowned painters whose lifespans encompassed his. In his works the individual qualities of numerous different painters are drawn together. The rounded forms and luminous colours of Perugino, the lifelike portraiture of Ghirlandaio, the realism and lighting of Leonardo and the powerful draughtsmanship of Michelangelo became unified in the paintings of Raphael. In his short life he executed a number of large altarpieces, an impressive Classical fresco of the sea nymph, Galatea, outstanding portraits with two popes and a famous writer among them, and, while Michelangelo was painting the Sistine Chapel ceiling, a series of wall frescoes in the Vatican chambers nearby, of which the School of Athens is uniquely significant. This fresco depicts a meeting of all the most learned ancient Athenians, gathered in a grand classical setting around the central figure of Plato, whom Raphael has famously modelled upon Leonardo da Vinci. The brooding figure of Heraclitus who sits by a large block of stone, is a portrait of Michelangelo, and is a reference to the latter's painting of the Prophet Jeremiah in the Sistine Chapel. His own portrait is to the right, beside his teacher, Perugino.Some sources identify this figure as Il Sodoma, but it is an older, grey-haired man, while Sodoma was in his 30s. Moreover, it strongly resembles several self-portraits of Perugino, who would have been about 60 at the time. But the main source of Raphael's popularity was not his major works, but his small Florentine pictures of the Madonna and Christ Child. Over and over he painted the same plump calm-faced blonde woman and her succession of chubby babies, the most famous probably being La Belle Jardini√®re (\\"The Madonna of the Beautiful Garden\\"), now in the Louvre. His larger work, the Sistine Madonna, used as a design for countless stained glass windows, has come, in the 21st century, to provide the iconic image of two small cherubs which has been reproduced on everything from paper table napkins to umbrellas.David Thompson, Raphael, the Life and Legacy, (1983)Jean-Pierre Cuzin, Raphael, his Life and Works, (1985) Early Mannerism Jacopo Pontormo, Entombment, 1528; Santa Felicit√†, Florence The early Mannerists in Florence, especially the students of Andrea del Sarto such as Jacopo da Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino, are notable for elongated forms, precariously balanced poses, a collapsed perspective, irrational settings, and theatrical lighting. As the leader of the First School of Fontainebleau, Rosso was a major force in the introduction of Renaissance style to France. Parmigianino (a student of Correggio) and Giulio Romano (Raphael's head assistant) were moving in similarly stylized aesthetic directions in Rome. These artists had matured under the influence of the High Renaissance, and their style has been characterized as a reaction to or exaggerated extension of it. Instead of studying nature directly, younger artists began studying Hellenistic sculpture and paintings of masters past. Therefore, this style is often identified as \\"anti-classical‚Äù,Friedl√§nder 1965,. yet at the time it was considered a natural progression from the High Renaissance. The earliest experimental phase of Mannerism, known for its \\"anti-classical\\" forms, lasted until about 1540 or 1550.Freedberg, Sidney J. 1993. Painting in Italy, 1500‚Äì1600, pp. 175-177, 3rd edition, New Haven and London: Yale University Press. (cloth) (pbk) Marcia B. Hall, professor of art history at Temple University, notes in her book After Raphael that Raphael's premature death marked the beginning of Mannerism in Rome. Later Mannerism Bronzino (d.1572), a pupil of Pontormo, was mostly a court portraitist for the Medici court, in a somewhat frigid formal Mannerist style. In the same generation, Giorgio Vasari (d. 1574) is far better remembered as the author of the Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, which had an enormous and lasting effect in establishing the reputation of the Florentine School. But he was the leading painter of history painting in the Medici court, although his work is now generally seen as straining after the impact that Michelangelo's work has, and failing to achieve it. This had become a common fault in Florentine painting by the decades after 1530, as many painters tried to emulate the giants of the High Renaissance. Baroque Cristofano Allori, Judith with the Head of Holofernes, 1613, Royal Collection version By the Baroque period, Florence was no longer the most important centre of painting in Italy, but was important nonetheless. Leading artists born in the city, and who, unlike others, spent much of their careers there, include Cristofano Allori, Matteo Rosselli, Francesco Furini, and Carlo Dolci. Pietro da Cortona was born in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and did much work in the city.

Geography Forstinning lies in the Munich region in the north of the Ebersberg district and on the northern edge of the Munich Schotterebene (a sandur) and the Ebersberg Forest. Neighbouring municipalities and unincorporated areas bordering the community are, clockwise beginning with those also in the Ebersberg district, Hohenlinden, the Ebersberg Forest (unincorporated), Anzing and Markt Schwaben, and continuing with those in the Erding district, Ottenhofen, Pastetten and Forstern. Forstinning has only one traditional rural land unit ‚Äì Gemarkung in German ‚Äì also called Forstinning. Forstinning's constituent communities include Aich, Aitersteinering, Berg, K√∂ckm√ºhle, Kressierm√ºhle, Moos, Neupullach, Niederried, Salzburg, Schu√üm√ºhle, Schwaberwegen, Sempt, Siegst√§tt, Steffelm√ºhle, Wagm√ºhle, Wind and Wolfm√ºhle. History Forstinning's history begins in Sempt, where the area's transport hub lay, with the Grafenburg (‚ÄúCount‚Äôs Castle‚Äù) as the trading post, with a market lent by the king (fiscale forum, 11th century), and the Reichshof (‚ÄúImperial Court‚Äù, curtis fiscalis, 934). The first greatness that this far- flung spot knew, however, does not date merely from Bavarii times, but from much longer ago, as witnessed by many archaeological finds nearby. The bronze ram figurine kept in the state's prehistoric collection may relate to the Celtic square dig site near Aitersteinering whose walls have been largely flattened by earthworks over time. The most recent findings suggest that such sites served as places of worship. There are many further traces of prehistory in the area. In the nearby state forest are found large groups of barrows from Hallstatt times. A Roman villa's remains were found a few decades ago at a remote mountain near Forstinning, and in Forstinning in 1958 a digger brought up a Bronze Age sword whose age was reckoned to be roughly 3,200 years. Only one old mill is nowadays left standing in Sempt. Now and then remnants of the old castle's and the old church's walls, the latter having been torn down in 1803, are brought to light when the Sempt brook overflows. This flooding sometimes also uncovers the castle graves whose loosely layered soil cannot withstand storm flooding quite as well as residual soil. Sempt Castle had the aforesaid brook as its moat. Even though Ebersberg may have taken over Sempt's heritage in a way, Forstinning must have been closely tied to the market town of Sempt. The church there, dedicated to John the Baptist, could have been the original Forstinning Parish's baptismal church. The find of a Bavarii row grave yard strengthens what the form of the placename already suggests: Forstinning was founded in the time when the land was first occupied by its current inhabitants. The first settler was an \\"Undeo\\" from one of the common local clans. About 1050, this may have yielded the local lordly family, as witnessed by an \\"Engildeo\\". The community's earliest recorded name was, accordingly, \\"Undeoingas\\" in about 804 (the 1,200th anniversary was observed in 2004). After undergoing many changes over the years from Undeingin to Undingen and Inding, the name Forstinning ‚Äì and sometimes also Pfarrinding ‚Äì for this community only cropped up in the 17th century. On 14 July 1894, Forstinning was beset by a tornado, which left great devastation in its wake. Religion Forstinning has a Roman Catholic parish church that belongs to the parish of Anzing-Forstinning and the Archdiocese of Munich-Freising. Population development The community's land area was home to 2,069 inhabitants in 1970, 2,638 in 1987 and 3,225 in 2000. Politics The community's mayor (B√ºrgermeister) is Rupert Ostermair (CSU). The community's tax revenue in 1999, converted to euros, was ‚Ç¨1,671,000, of which ‚Ç¨233,000 was from business taxes. Coat of arms Forstinning has canting arms in which one of the charges ‚Äì the two stylized fir trees ‚Äì suggests the key word element in the community's name, Forst ‚Äì German for ‚Äúforest‚Äù. This also symbolizes the community's location at the Ebersberg Forest. The Saint Sylvester Brotherhood (St. Silvesterbruderschaft), which looks back on a long history, could be said to be a local historical peculiarity. According to some documents pertaining to the local history, the Brotherhood also had at its disposal its own estate. Since the cross was associated with Saint Sylvester, it has been incorporated as a charge in the community's arms. The arms might heraldically be described thus: In azure a three-knolled hill (Dreiberg in German heraldry) Or, on each flanking knoll a fir tree Or, between which a cross argent. Town partnerships Forstinning has a partnership with the Hungarian community of Dunasziget. Culture and sightseeing The parish church Mari√§ Heimsuchung (‚ÄúChurch of the Visitation‚Äù) took on its current shape through Munich building master work in 1765 and 1766. The well maintained ceiling frescoes depict the Visitation and Pope Sylvester's worship of Mary. The high altar was built by a master craftsman from Markt Schwaben. The church's secondary patron was Saint Sylvester, upon whom a pilgrimage was bestowed by the Saint Sylvester Brotherhood, founded in the 15th century. He was said to be above all a patron of livestock. Economy and infrastructure=Industry, agriculture, forestry According to official statistics, 10 people on the social insurance contribution rolls were employed in agriculture and forestry in 1998 in Forstinning. In industry it was 227 and in trade and transport 183. In other fields, 129 people on the aforesaid rolls were employed, and 1,072 worked from their homes. There were no employees in processing industries. There were 12 businesses in contracting. Furthermore, in 2003, there were 36 agricultural businesses with a productive area of 972 ha. Transport Forstinning is connected to Germany‚Äôs Autobahn network by an interchange onto Bundesautobahn 94. Also, the Federal Highway (Bundesstra√üe) B 12, which joins the A94 in the community, runs through Forstinning, as does the regionally important state highway joining Rosenheim, Ebersberg, Markt Schwaben and Erding. Beyond the region, Forstinning is well known for the dispute over the extension of the A94. The disputed section lies between Forstinning and Ampfing. The nearest railway station can be found in Markt Schwaben, connecting to the Munich S-Bahn line S2. Public transport in Forstinning consists of buslines to Munich East Station (M√ºnchen-Ostbahnhof), Markt Schwaben, Gars, Hohenlinden and Ebersberg. Munich Airport is about 40 km away.

Early life Kitabatake Yao was born in Aomori city, Aomori Prefecture as the sixth of ten children. She began writing in high school and won a number of awards for short articles submitted to women‚Äôs magazines. After her graduation from high school, she moved to Tokyo and attended the Jissen Women's University, but was forced to drop out due to illness (tuberculosis (spondylitis) after around 18 months. She returned to Aomori and found employment as a substitute teacher in 1924, but continued to struggle with her sickness. In 1926, she published her initial works in the literary magazine Kaiz≈ç. Around this time, she also met fellow writer Fukada Ky≈´ya, with whom she started to live as his common law wife. With Fukada, she returned to Tokyo in 1929, living at first in Abiko, Chiba followed by Honjo in Tokyo. Although they were living together as husband and wife, Fukada never officially registered the marriage with the city office due to strong opposition from his family over Yao's weak health. Yao continued to write, but as her writing was affected by her strong Tohoku accent and lack of higher education, she relied on Fukada to copy edit her works. Fukada had the works published under his own name, and soon was receiving fame and adulation as a brilliant new author, not to mention the royalties from the works. However, leading literary critics Kobayashi Hideo and Kawabata Yasunari eventually realized that Asunarao and Fukada's previous work Orokko no musume were not Fukada's works at all, but had been copy-edited or plagiarized from the writings of Kitabatake Yao. The scandal nearly ended Fukada's credibility as a writer In March 1940, Fukada formally married Kitabatake Yao. However, in May 1941, Fukada happened to be reunited with his first love, Koba Shigeko (the daughter of Nakamura Mitsuo) in a chance meeting, and by August 1942, Shigeko gave birth to his illegitimate child. Yao soon found out about the affair, and Fukada quickly enlisted in the Imperial Japanese Army rather than return home. Fukuda was then ordered to wartime China. Literary career In 1947, Yao formally divorced Fukada. She had already published her first story for children in a magazine called Ginga (\\"Galaxy\\") in 1946. The story was about sensitive and resilient children suffering from the loss of their parents and siblings during the war. This was followed by Jiro Buchin Nikki which was first serialized in Ginga from January to December 1947 and then published in book form the next year by Shinchosha. It is a full-length story of Jiro and his younger sister (nicknamed Buchin) repatriated from Japan's South Pacific Mandate, who have come to live in a village in the T≈çhoku region of northern Japan. Although separated from their parents and elder brother, whom they missed very much, they are comforted and encouraged by kindly rural people surrounding them. In 1948, Yao moved in with author and literary critic Shiroyanagi Yoshihiko (1921‚Äì1992) almost 20 years her junior. They lived together in Kamakura, Kanagawa until her death of jaundice at the age of 78.

The nearest communities are Grafing and Ebersberg. The Bavarian capital, Munich, can be reached by S-Bahn (line S4), which runs over the Munich‚ÄìSalzburg line. Rosenheim and Wasserburg am Inn are each about 25 km away. History Buch is Kirchseeon's oldest constituent community, having had its first documentary mention in 809. In 842, a place called Sevun was mentioned for the first time. The name Chirichsewe first appeared in the 14th century. Until secularization, the Ebersberg Monastery maintained a small branch monastery in Kirchseeon. The community grew quickly once the surrounding woodlands fell victim to a natural disaster in 1889 in the form of a nun moth infestation. The Royal Bavarian Railway decided to make use of the denuded woods by building a sleeper works at Kirchseeon in 1889 and 1890. In 1939, the community of Kirchseeon was formed out of the former community of Eglharting, which itself had been formed in 1818. Its constituent communities were the villages of Buch and Kirchseeon-Dorf as well as the hamlets of Forstseeon, Osterseeon, Neukirch, Ilching and Riedering. At the same time, the church was promoted to a parish curacy. In 1959, the community itself was raised to market town. Since Eglharting's population had risen so sharply, the new Erl√∂serkirche (Church of the Redeemer) was consecrated there in 1973. In 1974, a new town hall was completed. Population growth Between 1988 and 2018 the market town's population grew by 45.9%, from 7,272 to 10,607 inhabitants. Coat of arms Kirchseeon's arms might heraldically be described thus: In vert between two conifers with roots Or a nun moth argent. Community layout After the Second World War, the hitherto isolated centres of Eglharting, Kirchseeon and Kirchseeon-Dorf were melded together along the Bundesstra√üe 304 (Munich-Wasserburg), mainly by building detached housing, with the combined centre at Kirchseeon railway station and a lesser centre at Eglharting. Supermarkets are to be found in both centres, and in Kirchseeon are many small and medium-sized shops. Along the B 304, properties are exposed to traffic noise.

Lordship was an island bounded by salt marshes to the north and Long Island Sound to the south, The neighborhood currently extends, by man made fill, as a peninsula on Long Island Sound and is bounded from the rest of Stratford by Sikorsky Memorial Airport to the north and Short Beach to the north east. Lordship is accessible by only two roads, both parts of Route 113. Lordship is home to the Stratford Point Light.  History  The first inhabitants of Lordship were the Paugussetts who had a large village at Frash Pond and smaller encampments at Stratford Point and at Indian Well (areas in Lordship). Indian Well was a fresh water pond where the old trolley line crossed Duck Neck Creek just north of the rotary near the firehouse. When the first settlers arrived in 1639, they found that Indians were using this area to plant corn, so there was little clearing necessary. Lordship, originally called Great Neck, was a ‚ÄúCommon Field‚Äù worked and owned by settlers who returned home to the safety of the palisade fort at Academy Hill at night. Richard Mills was the first to build a farmhouse in Great Neck in the western end near present-day Second Avenue. He sold his estate to Joseph Hawley (Captain) in 1650 and moved. It is in connection with his name that the term Lordship is first found, as applied to a meadow on what is still known as the Lordship farm. It is said in deeds of land - 1650 to 1660 ‚Äì several times, Mill‚Äôs Lordship and the Lordship Meadow. Richard Beach came to Stratford with a family and in 1662, he purchased one of five acres on west point of the Neck, butted south upon the meadow called Mill‚Äôs Lordship. Gustave Whitehead is reported to have used the windswept sandy areas of Lordship during some of his early powered flight trials in the early 1900s.

In 1900 he went to London, where he was for two years a pupil of Alberto Randegger at the Royal College of Music. During the winter of 1902/03 he studied under Bouhy at Paris, the next winter under Julius Stockhausen at Frankfurt; and finally he completed his studies with Emerich at Berlin in 1905. His operatic d√©but took place at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, in 1901. During the summer of 1904 he sang at the Royal Opera in Berlin. After having sung the role of Gurnemanz in Savage's production of Parsifal in America (1904‚Äì1905), he became in 1906 a regular member of the Berlin Opera. There he remained, appearing also as guest in various German cities, until he came to the Metropolitan Opera House in 1911, where through his interpretation of Wagner's heroes, he immediately won over the public and critics.

In the local dialect, the name is pronounced Pleaning. It has flourished in recent decades, partly as a commuter base for Munich, located some 20 km to the west. The official population level had reached 5,263 by 2006. Coat of arms The community's arms consist of a shield divided into three. Uppermost in the shield are two coloured bars, black on the right and gold on the left. Below this are three crowns on a blue background. The lowest and biggest part of the shield is taken up by a black bear on a silver background. History Sporadic prehistoric finds in the community point to the area's having been settled since the New Stone Age. In the Bronze Age a small settlement arose on a strip of grassland between the woods in the community's south end and the moor in the north. Sheep raising was the settlers‚Äô main livelihood. The later settlement ‚Äì between 850 BC and AD 50 ‚Äì is believed to have been established by the Celtic Hallstadt culture, which has been shown by ceramic finds. As this settlement developed, the at first loose structure shifted to a much tighter village structure. After southern Germany was conquered by the Romans about AD 50, the area became part of the Roman Empire. Some finds in the area also point to a Roman presence. The V√∂lkerwanderung, beginning about AD 400, brought with it new settlers: the Germanic stock of the Bavarii put down roots here. Also, a small Alemannic tribe settled in the area. Results of aerial archaeological photography show loose, scattered settlement. Under Gothic rule, political relations stabilized. The noble alemannic tribal leader Pleonunc became his village's namesake. The three ‚Äúoriginal yards‚Äù (Urh√∂fe) of Sellmayr, Wunsam and Wolfram stem from Pleonunc's time. About 700, the area was Christianized. The first church was built about 1000. Pliening Pliening grew out of the yard at Gelting. Until some time in the 14th century, it was called \\"Moospliening\\" to distinguish it from the older \\"Kirchpliening\\". Over time, the placename \\"Pliening\\" came to be used ever more often for the more westerly of the two places. Lying advantageously on the road between Erding and Munich, the community saw quick development in modern times. Currently, a ringroad around Gelting, Pliening and Landsham is being planned, which has unsettled retailers in the community of Pliening, as it is seen as potentially disruptive to their livelihoods. Where funding for this new road will come from is also still very much an open question. Gelting Gelting is a fusion of two older places: the southern part, known from documentary evidence to be older, and the northern part, Gelting. The southern part, once known as \\"Kirchpliening\\", consisted even into the Middle Ages only of the church and the original ‚Äúyard‚Äù (nowadays known as Zehmerhof). Over the centuries, the simple day labourers acquired houses, whereby the southern part of the village became more heavily populated. This south end is said to be the actual Pliening, and was founded by the Allemannic settler Pleon, whose tribe came originally from the Neckar area. In 813, the noble priest Cundhart donated parts of his estate \\"nahe bei Pleoningas\\" (‚Äúnear Pliening‚Äù) to the Bishop of Freising and built a church there, which is said to be the current church's forerunner. The northern part of Gelting, the actual Gelting, had its first documentary mention in 855 and is said to have been founded by someone named Gelto. It has not been fully established where he came from. The name could be a corruption of the name \\"Kelto\\" (which could point to an old Celtic settlement), or Gelto might have been among Pleon's kin, and founded a settlement near his cousin's. Landsham In the 19th and 20th centuries the Parish of Landsham was a branch of St. Andrew's Parish (\\"Pfarrei St. Andreas\\") in Kirchheim. For a long time, schoolchildren went to school in Kirchheim. Furthermore, a commercial-industrial park was built in Landsham in the 1990s, which has become the community's main income source.

Ashburnham Place is an English country house, now used as a Christian conference and prayer centre, five miles west of Battle, Sussex. It was one of the finest houses in the southeast of England in its heyday, but much of the structure was demolished in 1959,Colvin, Howard, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600-1840, 3rd ed. (Yale University Press) 1995 s.v. \\"George Dance\\". and only a drastically reduced part of the building now remains standing. Early history The village of Ashburnham was the home of the Ashburnham family from the 12th century. The family became wealthy through their land holdings in Sussex and around Pembrey in Carmarthenshire, and later from their participation in the Wealden iron industry. Only the cellars remain from the earliest known house on the site, dating from the 15th century. This house was abandoned in the 16th century and confiscated by Queen Elizabeth I. The Ashburnham family recovered their estate under Charles I, and John Ashburnham was a loyal servant of the King. He was forced to sell the estate to the Relf family in the English Commonwealth, to pay fines levied for supporting the King. John Ashburnham recovered the estate again after the English Restoration. His grandson and namesake, John Ashburnham, was created first Baron Ashburnham in 1689.

George Ashburnham, 3rd Earl of Ashburnham, commissioned architectural drawings from John Soane, but it is not known if the suggested additions, including a porte-cochere, were built. The house was refaced in stone in the early 19th century, and then, when fashions changed, a second, red brick outer skin was added in 1853.Dorothy Stroud, George Dance, Architect 1745-1825 (London) 1971; Colvin 1995: s.v. \\"George Dance\\". Internally, the house had a mix of styles, with a fine staircase by George Dance rising three floors in the central entrance hall. The drawing room was decorated with painted wall panels attributed to Athenian Stuart. The house held the family's fine collection of paintings and the extensive library, collected by the 3rd Earl and his son, Bertram Ashburnham, 4th Earl of Ashburnham.The archives were summarized by F.W.

The deal did not go ahead, and the books were sold piecemeal for a total of ¬£228,000 over the next few years.Peter H. Reid, \\"The Decline and Fall of the British Country House Library\\" Libraries & Culture 36.2, Spring 2001, pp. 345-366. Many were acquired by the British Library, but, for example, the sixth-to-seventh-century Ashburnham Pentateuch is in the Biblioth√®que nationale, Paris. The Earldom became extinct on the death of Thomas Ashburnham, 6th Earl of Ashburnham in 1924, and the house was inherited by his niece, Lady Catherine Ashburnham. The house was damaged when a fully loaded Marauder bomber crashed nearby during the Second World War, and dry rot set in. Lady Catherine was the last of this line of the Ashburnham family and the estate was inherited by Reverend John David Bickersteth (1926-1991), a great grandson of the 4th Earl, on her death in 1953. In addition to the prospect of huge repair bills, he was also saddled with crippling death duties of ¬£427,000. The contents of the house were sold at auction at Sotheby's in June and July 1953, and half of the estate was sold in the next few years. The house was mostly demolished in 1959, reducing the central section to two floors and the wings to a single story. The house is Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England and they are a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

He was a strong believer in, and promoted West Africa's economic integration alongside Adebayo Adedeji which subsequently led to the formation of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). He saw the need for a well-organized private sector and was devoted to developing and strengthening the private sector, he expended considerable resources to advance the activities of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Movement within Nigeria, West Africa and the Commonwealth. He held various positions in the Chamber of Commerce and industry Movement. He was the 4th President of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA), The 6th President of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the 1st President of the Federation of West African Chambers of Commerce (1972‚Äì1978) and the co-founder and founding President of the Nigerian-British Chamber of Commerce (NBCC) alongside Sir Adam Thomson, the Chairman of British Caledonian Airways now part of British Airways). He was a member of the Board of Governors of and former President of Nigerian-American Chamber of Commerce (NACC). He was also the Vice-President, Federation of Commonwealth Chambers of Commerce. Early life  Henry was born in Ile Oluji, Ondo State to the family of Daniel Famakinwa Fajemirokun and Felicia Adebumi Fajemirokun (n√©e Akinsuroju) (b.1891), daughter of High Chief Odofin Oganbule Akinsuroju and Madam Adesemi Akinsuroju, and granddaughter of Omoba Adebamigbei (whose father was the Jegun of Ile Oluji). He was educated at St.Peter's School, Ile-Oluji and then at St Luke's School, Oke-igbo for his primary education. For his secondary education, he educated at CMS Grammar School, Lagos and then at Ondo Boys High School (1942‚Äì1944). After Ondo Boys school, he joined the Royal West African Frontier Force at the age of 18 and served in India during World War II. After the war, he joined the Post and Telegraph Department as a clerk and studied privately for his Cambridge School Certificate.  Career  After serving during World War II, he began his career at the Post and Telegraph Department. He was a member of the workers' union in the department and rose to become President of the department's Ex-Servicemen's Union in 1948. In 1952, he became President of the Post and Telegraph's Clerical and Workers Allied Union. He started private business in 1955 from a loan he received from a maternal relative. He entered the agricultural export sector, exporting cattle bones first then hides and skin, cocoa, rubber, coffee and shea nuts and imported primarily cement. He earned the trust of buyers who extended letters of credit to finance his business. He added other ventures into his business activities, in 1962, he started a maritime services firm. By 1960 he had become one of the largest importers of cement from Egypt and Poland. He received funding for this particular venture from a credit facility that had been provided to him by a British bank in London.  Henry Stephens  As the founder, Chairman and largest shareholder of the Henry Stephens Group of companies, under his direction the company grew rapidly and diversified into several spheres such as cement and building materials, engineering, banking, insurance, shipping, ship broking and oil prospecting. He was a leading voice in industry and championed greater participation by Nigerians in the economy which was still dominated by foreign concerns primarily in industry.Following a decision to in 1972, an indigenization decree was promulgated by the Federal government to effect greater indigenous participation in different sectors of the economy. Although a strong proponent of greater indigenous participation, Fajemirokun was also cognizant of the need for continued foreign investment in the country and was vocal on maintaining a balance of both. Barring his failed bid to purchase a significant stake in the Daily Times. Fajemirokun did not participate in taking over any foreign concerns as a result of the indigenization decrees in 1972 and 1977. Before 1972, he had already pioneered industries and expanded his business interests and was able to form partnerships and joint ventures with foreign firms. Fajemirokun's hard work and masterful timing served him well and enabled him to expand organically into other industries. For more than a decade the Henry Stephens Group had managed to successfully build up a solid network trading with firms in foreign countries such as the United Kingdom, United States of America, Poland, Japan, Belgium, Egypt, Germany and Brazil; and had built up strong relationships and business partnerships, representing or acquiring stakes in foreign owned firms in Nigeria prior to the euphoria of the contemporary nationalism at the time in form of the indigenization decrees by the government. The Group was well positioned to expand into other industries and by 1977 was in the process of establishing hotels, truck assembly plants, breweries and other manufacturing concerns including the acquisition and development of mining quarries for cement. Groups such as his served to counter the competition from the Federal Military Government and foreign firms. The crowding out of the organized private sector by the FMG was vocally criticized because the belief was that the organized private sector was better suited to both manage the relationships with the foreign firms ensuring a longer term commitment to the country rather than triggering an exodus and to negotiate a fair price for the value of the equity being sold down rather than capitulating to the demands of the FMG the time. He led the negotiations to establish the first private merchant bank in the country Nigerian-American Merchant Bank Limited (NAMBL) bringing in First Bank of Boston (later Bank of Boston) alongside other indigenous investors. The bank was setup after his sudden death with the technical assistance and shareholding of Bank of Boston and Boston Overseas Financial Corporation (subsequently merged with Bank of America). He was a pioneer in the Nigerian maritime industry and was the first indigenous company to own an interest in a shipping line. He established Henry Stephens Shipping Company and the Nigeria Shipping Company with two lines: Nigeria-Far East Line and the Nigeria-South America Line and acquired three drybulk ships. The Nigeria- South America Line provided liner services between Brazil and the Nigerian Far East Line provided liner services to Japan and the Far East. He also ventured into commodity brokerage and in 1969 he bought and held a seat on the London Stock Exchange. His company Henry Stephens was a pioneer in Nigerian Oil industry as the first indigenous private oil company to get an offshore exploration license in the country's first ever offshore licensing round of oil prospecting licenses (OPL) in 1970. Bidding was opened between 26 February and 18 March on about 7000 square miles of the continental shelf. Twenty seven blocks were offered composed of areas relinquished according to leasing regulations 30 November 1968 plus additional deeper water acreage up to the 200 fathom line on the outer shelf. A total of 106 bids from over 30 oil companies or groups were made for these continental shelf OPLs. In July, Newcomers to Nigeria were offered blocks. Only 15 blocks were offered covering only half of the open area.

The key part being remoted is the graphics sub-system of the computer.  History  RGUs may have their origin with experiments with graphics controllers on mainframe computers in the 1970s. RGUs have been mostly associated with high end workstations running Unix-like operating systems or Windows since the late 1990s. Generally RGUs are used for special applications like remote sensing, financial services commodity trading desks, computer-aided design, etc. Depending on how one chooses to define RGUs, dedicated X terminals may also be included.  Application  Usually the reasons that might lie behind the desire to separate the user interface of a computer from the actual computer itself would be: securing computers away from users for corporate or government security, to reduce heat and noise in rooms with many computer operators, or to facilitate computer maintenance by placing all computers in very close proximity to one another.  KVM interoperability  Unlike other technologies used to achieve this, such as KVM Extension (or Remote KVM) and DVI Extension for example, a remote graphics unit will effectively split a computer's PCI or PCI-Express bus and transmit only bus commands over to the user side. With KVM Extension and DVI Extension, the graphics processing is done by a traditional graphics processing unit (GPU) on the computer side. Bus data is much smaller than rendered graphics data so the theory behind the remote graphics unit is that it is possible to achieve higher resolutions and better graphics performance when there is a large separation in distance between the user-side input/output devices and the computer side.  Examples  An example of a product line that was commercialized using RGU as the description of the technology is the Matrox Extio series. Extio is a brand that is marketing shorthand for \\"External I/O\\".  Related products  Other products supporting the concept behind the remote graphics unit include bus extension technologies where a standard graphics processing unit is plugged into a remote PCI slot via a standard graphics add-in card. Various types of bus extension technologies are available including the DeTwo System from Amulet Hotkey as well as products from Avocent.

Early life Kinoshita was born in what is now part of Okayama city, Okayama Prefecture, and was a direct lineal descendant of a brother-in-law of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. His uncle, Kinoshita Toshiyasu, was the 13th and last daimy≈ç of Ashimori han (25,000 koku). After the Meiji Restoration, he was given the title of viscount (shishaku) under the kazoku peerage system. When he died, his nephew Kinoshita Rigen, only 5 years old, succeeded to the main family as Viscount Kinoshita. Kinoshita would have thus been a daimy≈ç if the Tokugawa shogunate had lasted only a few years longer. Kinoshita attended the Gakush≈´in Peers' School, where he was a classmate of Mushanok≈çji Saneatsu. He subsequently graduated from the Literature Department of Tokyo Imperial University, where his classmates included Shiga Naoya, and he was a student of the poet Nobutsuna Sasaki. Beyond the Metropolis, page 264 Literary career Kinoshita was a co-founder of the Shirakabaha (\\"White Birch\\") Society, along with Shiga Naoya and Mushanok≈çji Saneatsu in 1910. He contributed extensively to the society's literary magazine, with elegant tanka verses, written in an easy-to-understand colloquial language. Kinoshita married a fellow student in 1911, the same year that he graduated, and had a son the following year. However, his son soon died; Kinoshita would father two more sons and one daughter, but only the third son survived. From 1912-1916, Kinoshita taught at a junior high school in the Mejiro neighborhood of Tokyo. Kinoshita published numerous anthologies of his verses, including Kogyoku (\\"Red Ball\\", 1919) and Ichiro (\\"One Alley\\", 1924). He joined the staff of the Araragi literary magazine in 1923. Kinoshita moved to Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture in 1919, as the sea air had a reputation for being good for lung disorders, and which was a favorite residence for many of the Shirakaba authors. However, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1922 and died on February 15, 1924.

He is known especially for his single trapeze act, which finished with a heel catch, as well as his ‚Äúwheel of death,‚Äù ‚Äúhuman space shuttle,‚Äù ‚Äúmechanical monster,‚Äù ‚Äúmotorcycle on the high wire‚Äù, and ‚Äúhuman cannonball‚Äù acts. His career as a performer ended with a technical mishap on 08 Jan 1987, when, performing the human cannonball, he over-shot his landing cushion. Early life Elvin Trevor Bale was born to Irene and Edwin Trevor (Tommy) Bale. Elvin was among the fourth generation of Bales in the circus industry. [The Bale family of performers in fact constitutes a dynasty in the entertainment world. In addition to the circus, they performed in music hall (vaudeville) using various stage names (see www.TheRoyalZanettos.com).] After an early childhood touring with European circuses, Elvin and his family moved to the United States in the 1950s when his father took a job as a tiger trainer with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. As a youngster, Elvin worked as a clown, a dancing boy, a cage boy for his father's tiger act, and an acrobat in the family‚Äôs bicycle act. His twin sister, Dawnita; older sister, Gloria; and younger sister, Bonnie, also worked in a variety of family acts in various shows. In the 1960s Elvin began working on what would become his signature act, the single trapeze with a ‚Äúheel catch‚Äù finish. Mr. Bale's Father appeared as a guest along with Ray Bolger on American Game Show \\"What's My Line\\". Life as a daredevil In The American Circus, John Culhane calls Elvin Bale ‚Äúthe greatest circus daredevil of the second half of the twentieth century.‚Äù After working with Art Concello‚Äôs American Circus in Russia in 1968, Elvin joined the Blue Unit of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in 1969. He would headline the Blue Unit in the 70s and early 80s, and his single trapeze act won him the Circus Oscar at the 1973 Circus World Festival in Madrid, Spain, as well as the 1976 Gold Clown, given out by the International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo for the best circus performance of the year. He ended his trapeze act by sitting on the trapeze, swinging it up to its highest point, then diving forward into space with a yell‚Äîwith no net underneath‚Äîthrowing his legs back just in time to catch the middle of the bar on the descent with his Achilles‚Äô heels and swing back, hanging by his Achilles‚Äô heels. Elvin performed in the Vatican for Pope John Paul II, under helicopters in the French Alps, and at African soccer stadiums. Elvin was also known as \\"The Phantom of Balance\\" for his work on the \\"wheel of death\\". He mounted an 8-foot steel-mesh wheel on the end of a 38-foot steel arm suspended from the ceiling. As the arm spun around its axis, Elvin would run around the outside of the wheel, sometimes blindfolded, sometimes with a man standing on his shoulders. He won the Silver Clown in 1979 for that act. In addition, he performed a high-wire motorcycle act, standing on his hands as much as 150 feet above the floor of the arena while riding the motorcycle backwards down the wire. Besides circus arenas, he also performed the motorcycle act on a high wire strung over a 300-foot canyon at Black‚Äôs Beach near San Diego, California. Elvin is perhaps best known now for his human cannonball act, which he began with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. in 1978 as the ‚ÄúHuman Space Shuttle.‚Äù He left RBBB in 1983 and toured as the featured performer with several European circuses. On January 8, 1987, he permanently injured his thoracic vertebrae in a human cannonball accident in Hong Kong, resulting in paralysis in both legs. Life in circus administration After recovering from his accident, Elvin became a theatrical booking agent, and since the mid-1990s, he has traveled and worked in management roles with Cole Bros. Circus. Currently he serves as their vice president of operations as well as booking and directing the show. In 2001, Elvin was inducted into the International Circus Hall of Fame.

It served with the Royal Flying Corps and the Imperial Russian Air Service, which subsequently led to the Red Air Force adopting it during the Russian Civil War. Design and development G. H. Challenger designed the F.B.19,Bruce 1969, p. 112. which first flew in August 1916. It was a single-engine, single-bay, equal-span biplane, slightly smaller than either the Sopwith Camel or Nieuport 17, with a proportionally large engine fairing and tall fuselage, which gave it a relatively stubby appearance. It was armed with one synchronised 7.7mm Vickers machine gun, mounted unusually on the left-hand side of the fuselage, to facilitate the installation of the Vickers-Challenger synchroniser gear, also a Challenger design. The 100-hp Gnome Monosoupape engine gave a relatively slow speed, and the relatively low cockpit position, placed behind a wide rotary engine and between unstaggered wings, severely limited visibility for the pilot. The clearest view was sometimes said to be upwards, through a transparent section in the upper wing. Modifications were introduced, including a more powerful 110-hp (82-kW) Le Rh√¥ne or Clerget engine and staggered mainplanes, culminating in the Mk II design.Andrews, C.F and Morgan, E.B., 1988. Vickers Aircraft since 1908. London: Putnam. . The plane's relative success on the Eastern Front appears to have been due in part to it receiving a more powerful engine in Russia.  Operational history  Around sixty-five F.B.19s were built. Six early production examples were sent to France in late 1916 for operational evaluation, where the RAF found them unsuitable for the fighting conditions then evolving. Twelve Mk IIs went to the Middle East, five to Palestine and seven to Macedonia; no squadron was fully equipped with the type. They were not popular. A few Mk IIs served as trainers and for air defense over London, but the type had effectively been retired before the end of 1917. The F.B.19 found more favour in Russia, where it was known as the Vikkers Bullit. A single example was initially sent for evaluation in 1916. Leading pilots, including the ace Yevgraph Kruten, regarded it favourably. Russian sources indicate that it was fitted with a more powerful 130-hp Clerget engine that provided a maximum speed of around 200 km/h, making the Bullit faster than both the SPAD S.VII and the Sikorsky S-20. The Russians procured around twenty or thirty planes, and deployed at least four to front- line units, including one in which the ace Grigoriy Suk claimed two of his victories. A number of unarmed planes served as trainers. After the October Revolution, a number of Bullits found their way into Bolshevik hands. A force of six F.B.19s are said to have been employed in 1918 against the anti- Bolshevik People's Army, and the type remained in service until 1924. All examples of the F.B.19s active in Russian service appear to have been Mk. I planes with unstaggered wings. A number of additional examples are said to have remained in crates on the dockside at Archangelsk until the British Royal Navy destroyed them during the evacuation of the allied expeditionary force in 1919.

One day when sulking in the bathtub, a mysterious, naked devil-tailed girl appears out of nowhere. Her name is Lala Satalin Deviluke, the runaway crown princess of the planet Deviluke. Her father wants her to return home to marry one of her marriage candidates. When Devilukean commander Zastin arrives to bring her home, she swiftly declares she will marry Rito in order to stay on Earth, leading Zastin to attack Rito. But when Rito angrily declares that marriage is only possible with the person you love, the two dull-witted aliens misunderstand him, believing he truly understands Lala's feelings. Lala quickly falls in love with him, and Zastin also approves of their engagement, much to Rito's dismay. While Zastin reports his support for the pair to Lala's father, Gid Lucion Deviluke, who is the King of Deviluke and much of the known universe, Rito reluctantly helps Lala transition to life on Earth, while gradually befriending his dream girl, Haruna, along with a colorful cast of other girls (both humans and aliens), such as the uptight, high-strung girl Yui Kotegawa, the gender-switching alien Run/Ren, and the queen bee Saki Tenjouin, among others. In the meantime, Rito must also fight off Lala's antagonistic alien suitors, one of whom sends the alien assassin Golden Darkness to kill him. To Love Ru Darkness The story continues in To Love Ru Darkness, which focuses on Lala's little sister, Momo Belia Deviluke. She and her twin sister, Nana Astar Deviluke, have since come to live with Lala in Rito's house. While Rito remains indecisive between his longtime crush on Haruna and his growing affection for Lala, Momo has also fallen in love with Rito. But not wanting to steal Rito away from her sister, Momo instead plots to build a harem of girls around Rito, hoping that if Rito marries Lala and becomes the King of Deviluke, he can legally marry every girl who is in love with him, including Momo herself. While Momo works in the background and plays matchmaker with Rito, a plethora of beautiful girls gradually enter Rito's life and warm up to his kindness, including Golden Darkness, who has since lived peacefully on Earth but struggles to escape her dark past.

Reception The seventh manga volume was the best-selling manga volume in its first week of release in Japan. In November 2014, readers of Media Factory's Da Vinci magazine voted To Love Ru number 20 on a list of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jumps greatest manga series of all time. Anime News Network had four different writers review the first two- in-one omnibus volume of To Love Ru. Lynzee Loveridge, Amy McNulty and Rebecca Silverman each gave it a 3 out of 5 rating. Loveridge described the work as pure harem and praised Yabuki's comedic artwork, but felt that the personality types of the love-triangled main characters were \\"retreading well worn ground.\\" McNulty disagreed, calling Lala \\"refreshingly charming\\" and noting that Haruna does not enter tired tropes either. Silverman called Yabuki's art dynamic and attractive and recommended the series to fans of harem rom-coms, but called the plot very clich√© and providing nothing new. McNulty stated that the beginning with just the original love-triangle works just fine, making the love interests added later seem unnecessary, and comes off as quaint when compared to To Love Ru Darkness. Also in comparison to the sequel, Loveridge described the original series as tame in comparison to the \\"thinly veiled hentai\\" that is To Love Ru Darkness. Austin Price, the fourth writer, gave it a scathing review, calling the story a straight rip-off of Urusei Yatsura and claiming the jokes were ripped straight from harem comedy classics such as Ranma ¬Ω, Tenchi Muyo! and Love Hina. He also called Yabuki \\"the most utterly unremarkable artist in Shonen Jumps history.\\" Stig H√∏gset and Tim Jones of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews described the first season of the anime series as \\"a watered down Urusei Yatsura for the 21st century\\" and called it the worst romantic comedy they have ever seen. They mainly criticized the anime's large amounts of original material not adapted from the manga, but also noted poor animation and music. When they reviewed the Motto To Love Ru anime, H√∏gset and Jones felt it improved significantly as it reduces manga arcs into 7 minutes each so as to include three in each episode. They gave it 3 out of 5 stars, but stated it unfortunately focuses on the \\"lesser characters\\" too often, and their \\"antics will get old in 5 minutes.\\" In 2012, To Love Ru Darkness was reviewed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly to see if it violated their newly passed controversial Bill 156. This was after they had received a phone call from a parent who discovered a To Love Ru Darkness book while cleaning a son's room. The parent did not like that there was frontal nudity of a female character, including her lower body. At the meeting on April 9, 2012, they decided that while the book did include the aforementioned nudity, it did not violate the new ordinance.

His father was a church muralist, painter and sculptor. Popp finished his art studies in 1848, at the Academy of Fine Arts from Vienna, where he developed a serious academic style. He carried on the work of his father by painting several churches from Bucharest, Bra»ôov (Tocile, Saint Nicholas Church), Araci, R√¢»ônov, Satulung, T√¢rgu-Jiu, C√¢mpulung, Urla»õi, etc. Between 1847 and 1853 he painted with Constantin Lecca the church of Curtea Veche from Bucharest. But his main art legacy resides in creating many portraits of the personalities of his time (Ion Heliade RƒÉdulescu, Andrei Mure»ôanu, Vasile Alecsandri, etc.) and of some famous historical figures, such as Michael the Brave, inspired from a contemporary engraving of the voivode. His paintings can be admired in Bucharest at the Romanian Literature Museum and the National Art Museum, as well as in museums in Arad, Bra»ôov, Ploie»ôti, and Sibiu.

The Resolution then called for the creation of a federal 'United States of Indonesia' in which elections for constituents to a constituent assembly would be completed by October 1949 and to whom the Netherlands would transfer sovereignty of Indonesia to by July 1950.

It divides the neighborhood of Williamsburg from Clinton Hill and East Williamsburg from Bushwick. After crossing the Queens border, the avenue serves as the dividing line between Ridgewood, Queens and West Maspeth. Flushing Avenue then terminates in Maspeth. Despite its name, however, the avenue does not extend to Flushing. Flushing Avenue has seen considerable decline since its heyday in the early and mid-20th century. Some sections began to gentrify, to varying degrees, at the turn of the 21st century. In 2004, the city began a project to upgrade the water and sewer infrastructure on the western part of the road, and to repave it; the project was completed in 2008. Route description The avenue is primarily an industrial thoroughfare. On its extreme western end, it serves the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a former naval shipyard turned industrial park. Part of the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway bike path runs alongside Flushing Avenue in this area. In this district, the south side of Flushing Avenue contains many abandoned business that were supported by sailors and ship workers before the government closed the yard. Continuing eastward, Flushing Avenue crosses the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. This section of Flushing Avenue, between the expressway and Broadway, has seen considerable redevelopment over recent years by Williamsburg's Hasidic population, as young urban professionals have moved into the northern end of Williamsburg. The north side of Flushing Avenue in this section is a primarily residential area, whereas the south side is primarily industrial, the most notable exception being the Marcy Houses housing project. The Flushing Avenue subway station is at Flushing and Marcy Avenues. Flushing Avenue forms the south side of the so-called \\"Broadway Triangle\\", bounded on the northeast by Broadway and on the west by Union Avenue, whose factories were largely abandoned shortly after the turn of the 21st century. The Triangle was rezoned as \\"residential\\" in December 2009.Brooklyn Paper Broadway Triangle advances The commercial heart of Flushing Avenue is the intersection with Broadway and Graham Avenue, in the extreme southern end of Williamsburg. This business improvement district is serviced by the trains' Flushing Avenue stop. In this area are cheap retail shopping, food shops and fast-food chains. This primarily Puerto Rican and Hasidic area is becoming increasingly populated with students and young professionals. Near the intersection with Bushwick Avenue, residential Bushwick borders Flushing Avenue to the south, and the massive Bushwick Houses to the north. At Morgan and at Wyckoff Avenue, a community of artists and young professionals have moved into the low-rise lofts that were once abandoned. An effect of this gentrification was the opening of two bar- restaurants, Life Cafe and the Wreck Room, on an adjacent section of Flushing Avenue. Continuing past Wyckoff Avenue, the avenue crosses into Queens, passes the historic Vander Ende-Onderdonk House Site (formerly in Brooklyn, now Queens), and becomes actively industrial on both sides. Upon entering Maspeth, it is a residential street. Transportation The B57 bus runs the entire length of the avenue. There are two New York City Subway stations along Flushing Avenue. The stops at Flushing Avenue and Union Avenue. The stop at Flushing Avenue and Broadway. The also stops nearby at the Jefferson Street station.

It was released as a single in June 1966, and also included as the title track on the Byrds' third album, Fifth Dimension. Lyrical content McGuinn has described the song's lyrics as an attempt to explain Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, and as having been directly inspired by the book 1-2-3-4, More, More, More, More by Don Landis. In a 1966 interview with Hit Parader magazine, McGuinn stated, \\"It's sort of weird but...what I'm talking about is the whole universe, the fifth dimension, which is height, width, depth, time and something else. But there definitely are more dimensions than five. It's infinite. The fifth dimension is the threshold of scientific knowledge.\\" Talking to Michael Ross of Creem magazine in 1970, McGuinn further explained the song's meaning: \\"'5D' was an ethereal trip into metaphysics, into an almost Moslem submission to an Allah, an almighty spirit, free-floating, the fifth dimension being the 'mesh' which Einstein theorized about. He proved theoretically - but I choose to believe it.\\" According to the Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan, the song's abstract lyrics were largely interpreted by the band's audience as being about an LSD trip, much to McGuinn's dismay. The notion that the song was about psychedelic drugs was given further credence when it was singled out, within a month of its release, by Variety magazine as one of a recent spate of pop songs containing references to illegal drug use. As a result of these allegations, the song was banned by some radio stations in the U.S. Recording and release The master recording of \\"5D (Fifth Dimension)\\" was taped on May 24 and 25, 1966, during sessions for the Fifth Dimension album, with Allen Stanton serving as record producer. The song features the Bach-influenced organ and electric piano playing of Los Angeles composer, arranger, producer, and session musician, Van Dyke Parks. The song was issued as a single on June 13, 1966, and reached number 44 on the Billboard Hot 100, but failed to chart in the United Kingdom. The song was also included on the band's third album, Fifth Dimension, which was released on July 18, 1966. Critic Bruce Eder, writing for the AllMusic website, called the song, \\"the most improbable single ever issued by the Byrds\\", and \\"the most daring opening track ever on any Byrds album.\\" He went on to note that it followed the release of the band's influential \\"Eight Miles High\\" single, although, in his opinion, \\"5D (Fifth Dimension)\\" was more challenging and arguably took the Byrds' psychedelic experimentation to further extremes.\\" \\"5D (Fifth Dimension)\\" was a favorite of the Byrds' bass player, Chris Hillman, who described it as \\"one of the greatest songs McGuinn has ever written.\\" Following its release, \\"5D (Fifth Dimension)\\" was performed sporadically during the Byrds' 1966 live concerts, but was abandoned for most of the rest of the group's lifespan. However, the song is frequently performed by McGuinn during his solo concerts and consequently appears on his 2007 live album, Live From Spain. In addition to its appearance on the Fifth Dimension album, \\"5D (Fifth Dimension)\\" also appears on several Byrds' compilations, including The Byrds' Greatest Hits, History of The Byrds, The Original Singles: 1965‚Äì1967, Volume 1, The Byrds, The Very Best of The Byrds, The Essential Byrds, and There Is a Season.

He played in the Irish band Toledo, later renamed Amarillo, and much later as Tennessee Sunshine before launching as vocalist and guitarist before launching a solo career and a prosperous songwriting career. He is best known for writing the Irish entry for the 1997 Eurovision Song Contest - a song entitled \\"Mysterious Woman\\" which achieved second place. Early career in bands In 1976, Farry was asked to join a band called Toledo as a guitarist and an addition to the existing members of the group, John Lunny (rhythm guitar) and Tom Flanagan (accordion) both natives of Belleek, County Fermanagh. John's older brother Noel also joined as drummer. Following Lunny's death (in a fire which also claimed the lives of other family members), Flanagan and the Farry brothers re-formed the group by inviting Kathleen McKeaney on board as rhythm guitarist/vocalist. The group flourished on the North West lounge circuit and assumed a harder musical edge following Flanagan's retirement from the business. As the group continued to be successful, the Farry brothers invited Lavinus Gordon (bass guitar), also a native of Belleek, County Fermanagh, to join the group and they subsequently re-packaged as Amarillo. This period saw John Farry's swift development as an accomplished country singer, excelling in both lead and harmony parts. Within the next couple of years, Amarillo was augmented by the addition of lead guitarist, Eugene Cunningham, a native of Belcoo. This outfit prospered and became one of the best country and pop acts in Ulster during this period. John Farry excelled as lead singer with a penchant for top class interpretations of Don Williams, Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard material. When Cunningham departed from the band to pursue a full-time professional career as a lead guitarist, the band repackaged under the name Tennessee Sunshine. This group continued to enjoy great success and had just one further change of personnel when drummer Noel Farry retired from the business in 1982. Farry hired Paul Quinn from Enniskillen as the new skinsman/vocalist and the band continued to go from strength to strength. Solo career In the mid-1980s, John Farry, conscious of the narrowing market for three and four-piece bands, decided to pursue a solo career. His solo career has been a tremendous success, punctuated by his emergence as a top class singer-songwriter. Songwriting One of Farry's earliest compositions, \\"Lough Melvin's Rocky Shore\\" became a hit for the rising young star from Donegal, Daniel O'Donnell. O'Donnell went on to record a number of John Farry tracks, with \\"Summertime in Ireland\\" becoming the Kincasslagh crooner's first number one hit in Ireland in 1987. Aside from O'Donnell, Farry's songs have also been recorded by Brendan Quinn, Marc Roberts, Ray Lynam, Michael O'Brien and Mick Flavin. Farry's songwriting talent received its greatest exposure to date in 1997, when Marc Roberts sang \\"Mysterious Woman\\" to number 2 in the Eurovision Song Contest held in London. Farry has also recorded in Nashville, Tennessee. Farry continues to perform throughout Ireland and to write country music songs along with managing Country and Irish star Nathan Carter. Personal life Farry was born in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, the sixth member in a family of seven (four boys and three girls).

North Central College associate professor Matthew Krystal notes, in his book, Indigenous Dance and Dancing Indian: Contested Representation in the Global Era, that \\"Whereas men's styles offer Grass Dance as a healing themed dance, women may select Jingle Dress Dance.\\" The regalia worn for the dance is a jingle dress, which includes ornamentation with multiple rows of metal, such as cones, that create a jingling sound as the dancer moves.  Origins  Teenaged jingle dress competitor, with fan A contemporary jingle dressOrigin of the jingle dress is attributed to three different Ojibwa communities: the Mille Lacs, Red Lake Band of Chippewa and the Whitefish Bay Ojibwe. In both the Mille Lacs and Whitefish Bay versions, the dress and the dance appeared in a recurring vivid dream that was realized about the year 1900. In both versions, the dream came to a Midewinini. In both dreams, there were four women, each wearing a jingle dress and dancing. Each dream also gave instructions on how to make the dresses, what types of songs went with them and how the dance was to be performed. In the Mille Lacs' version, the Midewinini upon awakening, with his wife made four dresses. He showed his wife how to dance in the dress, which he showed to the four women he had dreamed about, by calling the four women who in his dream wore them, dressed them in the dresses, brought them forth at a dance, told the people about the dream, and how the way the Midewikweg were to dress and dance. The Mille Lacs' version of the story continues that the reason for this recurring dream was because the daughter of the Midewinini was gravely ill. When it came time for the drum ceremony, the man and his wife brought their little girl. They sat at the ceremony, and the girl lay on the floor because she was quite ill. After the ceremony, the Midewinini got up and told the people about his dream. Then he brought out the four women and said they were going to dance in the style he had dreamed about. The drum started, the people began to sing, and the women danced. As the evening went on, the daughter was sitting up and watching. Before the night was over, the girl was so moved by the dancers that she was following the women and dancing around. Whitefish Bay's version is nearly identical, but with the ill child being the granddaughter of the Midewinini. One night he had a vision of a spirit in a dress and the spirit told him that if he made this dress and put it on his grand daughter that she would become well. The medicine man made the dress and brought his grand daughter to the dance circle. The first round around the circle the girl could not walk so she was carried. The second time around the girl could walk but still needed help from some of the woman in the community. The next time around the circle the girl was able to walk by herself. Due to both versions of the story, some women adopted the jingle dress as a healing dress. People often give jingle dress dancers tobacco to have them pray for themselves or people they care for that are not well. Due to the strong family connections between the Removable and Non-Removable Mille Lacs Indians of the Mille Lacs and White Earth Indian Reservations, the Mille Lacs Indians' version spread to White Earth and to other Ojibwe Reservations. In the late 1920s, the White Earth people gave the jingle dress to the Lakota and it spread westward into the Dakotas and Montana. Description Girls in contemporary jingle dress competition Footwork The traditional jingle dance is characterized by the jingle dress and light footwork danced close to ground. The dancer dances in a pattern, her feet do not cross, they do not dance backward or turn a complete circle. Compared to the original dance, the contemporary dance can be fancier, with intricate footwork and the dress design is often cut to accommodate these footwork maneuvers. Contemporary dancers do often cross their feet, turn full circles and dance backwards. Such moves exemplify the differences between contemporary and traditional jingle dress dancing. Regalia Jingle dresses were originally made of fabric in solid, \\"healthy\\" colors ‚Äì red, green/yellow, black and blue. Each dress was adorned with jingles on the sleeves, the top, and one, two, or three rows of jingles on the bottom. The jingles were made from chewing tobacco can lids, rolled into cones. Contemporary jingle dresses, introduced in the 1980s, are made from multi-coloured fabric decorated with tin jingles, originally made from lids of chewing tobacco cans, but now frequently constructed of other metals. The jingle count on a child's dress is about 100 to 130 or 140, and for a woman's size the amount varies depending on the design of the dress. The contemporary dancer carries a feather fan, often wearing eagle plumes or feathers in her hair.

History The palace was built on the site of a medieval castle or rocca. Obtained by Niccol√≤ III d'Este from the della Rosa family in the 15th century, and converted into a court residence by Borso d'Este in 1458. The exterior facade seems to reference Tuscan villas more than those of the Veneto. In the mid-16th century, the first pleasure summer villa was built on the site. In the early 17th century, the Duke Francesco I d'Este commissioned the present building from the architect Bartolomeo Avanzini. Over the centuries, the palace has had many owners, but is now owned by the town of Sassuolo and the Gallerie Estensi, who contributed to the picture galleries the Orlando, Princess and Secchia apartments.Gallerie Estensi, \\"Palazzo Ducale di Sassuolo App,\\" Apple App Store, Vers.1.5 (May 2018).  The exhibition  The palace is best known for its highly decorated interior frescoes (1638-1656) by the French Este court painter Jean Boulanger, as well as several perspectival ceilings by Ottavio Vivani, Giacomo Cialdieri, Angelo Michele Colonna, Agostino Mitelli, Baldassare Bianchi and Giovanni Giacomo Monti. Lattanzio Maschio and Luca Colombi were also invited by Boulanger to work on the palace stucco decoration. Giovanni Lazzoni, Nicolas R√©gnier, Salvator Rosa, and Ludovico Lana also contributed to the palace's art collection. The palace is also known for its garden vistas reminiscent of Versailles and its fanciful Peschiera or fish-tank. The latter was originally designed by Avanzini and as a large rectangular \\"pool\\" surrounded by a boundary wall in the form of a ruined amphitheatre, for which it earned its sobriquet the \\"Fontanazzo\\" (Rough Fountain). Highlights of the complex also include larger-than-life fountain sculptures based on the designs of Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Renaissance fresco fragments by Nicol√≤ dell‚ÄôAbbate recovered from the Scandiano palace in Reggio Emilia. Restoration of the piano nobile in 2001 has allowed the palace to be equally used as a space for contemporary art exhibitions, fusing past and present. Terminating the tour of the Duke and Duchesses‚Äô private and public apartments on the first floor, the Stuccoed apartments have hosted the exhibition ‚ÄúMONOCHROMATIC LIGHT‚Äù since 2003.

His last club was San Isidro Club. His usual position was at flanker. Schusterman started his career in 1997 with San Isidro Club in Argentina. In 2003 he made his debut for the Argentina national rugby union team and in 2003 he joined Plymouth Albion. In 2006 he joined Leeds Carnegie, then known as Leeds Tykes, and helped the club to secure promotion to the Guinness Premiership. In 2008 he returned to amateur rugby to his home club San Isidro Club. At the time in Plymouth, he made an instant impression at the club, with a try on his debut against Coventry, after coming on from the substitutes bench. Just two games later he had forced his way into the starting line up and then retained his place for the remainder of the season. He ended the campaign as the club's second highest try scorer with a total of 10 tries. The following season he continued to make his mark on the Albion side and notched up a further 7 tries to help Plymouth to a third-place finish. In his final season at the club he made 21 appearances and once again proved his try scoring abilities with a further 9 tries. That year Plymouth finished fifth and Martin was named in the Rugby Times National Division One Team of the Year.

It was bought by the Wedgwood pottery company in 1937,Marcus Binney and Kit Martin, The country house: to be or not to be (London, Save Britain's Heritage, 1982), p.105 but disrepair and subsidence due to coal mining brought the hall close to demolition in the early 1980s. It was bought for ¬£1 by a trust set up by Save Britain's Heritage and restored. It has returned to use as a private residence. The hall is a Grade I listed building. History Barlaston Hall was probably designed by architect Sir Robert Taylor for Thomas Mills, an attorney from Leek, in 1756-58, to replace the existing manor house that he had acquired through marriage. The hall has a red-brick exterior, and is one of a few of Taylor's buildings which retain his trademark octagonal and diamond glazing in the sash windows. From the entrance court, a flight from steps leads up to a central doorway with pilasters and segmental pediment. The doorway provides access to a central Doric hall which opens on to two of the three main reception rooms and an inner hall with domed skylight containing a cantilevered staircase leading to a galleried landing on the first floor, and further stairs giving access to the second upper floor and attic. Services are within a lower ground floor or basement level. The gardens and grounds of about were landscaped by William Sawrey Gilpin. The house is located beside the parish church of St John the Baptist (now deconsecrated). The hall came into the Adderley family in 1816 when Rosamund Mills, co-heiress of the Barlaston estate, married Ralph Adderley of Coton Hall, Hanbury, Staffordshire. Their son Ralph Thomas Adderley was High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1866. Following his death in 1931 the estate was put up for sale and was bought by the Wedgwood pottery company in 1937, as a site to replace its operation in Etruria a few miles away in an industrial part of Stoke-on-Trent. A new electric pottery and model village for its employees were built in the grounds. From 1945 the hall housed the Wedgwood Memorial College, but when the building was found to contain dry rot, they left and moved elsewhere in the village. Wedgwood continued to maintain the Hall until the late 1960s after which the hall was vandalised and lead removed from the roof. It also suffered major subsidence due to coal mining. The house had been built across a geological fault, and wide cracks had opened in its walls. Restoration By the early 1980s, the hall was in a parlous state of decay, with few repairs for many years, water ingress, and a serious threat of subsidence having been undermined by coal workings. Floorboards had been removed, most of the staircase had collapsed, and ceilings and plasterwork had fallen through to the basement. Wedgwood made two applications to have the Grade 1 listed building demolished, and a public inquiry was convened. Save Britain's Heritage, with Kit Martin, architect Bob Weighton and engineering firm Peter Dann & Partners, formulated a plan to restore and protect the house. The National Coal Board said that it would pay for the subsidence damage and preventative works to construct a raft under the building, so, early on 29 September 1981, Wedgwood offered to sell Barlaston Hall to Save Britain's Heritage for ¬£1, on condition that the restoration was completed within five years, in default of which Wedgwood retained an option to repurchase the hall for ¬£1. An independent trust was established to restore the house, starting with repairs to the roof. However, the NCB reneged on the undertaking it had given at the public inquiry to pay for repairs to past subsidence damage, and for other preventative works, and offered ¬£25,000 compensation under the Coal Act instead. Save applied for judicial review against the NCB and the Secretary of State for the Environment, whose delayed certification was behind the NCB's change of view. The certificates were quickly issued, forcing the hand of the NCB, which eventually agreed to pay ¬£120,000 in compensation, to fund preventative works, and meet the legal costs. Wedgwood also extended the original 5-year restoration period by a further 3 years. Grants from English Heritage, the Historic Buildings Council, the Manifold Trust and a loan from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, allowed the external restoration to be largely completed in the early 1990s. This involved extensive works including inserting a concrete raft under the building to protect against further mining subsidence. In 1992 Save Britain's Heritage decided to sell the hall before the internal restoration had been started. It was bought by James and Carol Hall who completed the internal restoration over a period of more than five years. This included new internal walls, ceilings, plasterwork and staircases. Much of the work was done by craftsmen who had developed their skills on the earlier restoration of Uppark. As of 2015, Barlaston Hall was on the market with a guide price of ¬£2.3 million.

Like the county, the mountain and the associated surrounding Belknap Mountains are named after Jeremy Belknap (1744‚Äì1798), a renowned preacher, historian, and author of The History of New Hampshire. The mountain is within Belknap Mountain State Forest. The peak of Belknap Mountain is the highest point in the county. Although of only modest elevation, the isolation of the Belknap Mountains gives Belknap Mountain of relative height above the low ground separating it from the White Mountains, making it one of the fifty most topographically prominent peaks in New England. Belknap Mountain is flanked to the northwest by Gunstock Mountain, the site of the Gunstock Mountain Resort ski area. The summit of Belknap Mountain features an active fire tower. Belknap Mountain stands within the watershed of the Merrimack River, which drains into the Gulf of Maine in Massachusetts. The east and northeast sides of Belknap Mountain drain into Poorfarm Brook, thence into Lake Winnipesaukee, the Winnipesaukee River, and the Merrimack. The west side drains into Gunstock River, thence into Lake Winnipesaukee. The south side drains into Manning Lake, thence into Crystal Lake, the source of the Suncook River, and thence into the Merrimack River. Geology Belknap Mountain, and the mountains with which it is closely associated in the Belknap Mountain range, are part of the White Mountain Magma Series, as described by Long. This series of mountains of igneous origin represents volcanic activity that occurred during the Jurassic period, about 200-150 mya. The White Mountain Magma series is thought to have formed above an aborted transform fault in the crust. Volcanic activity facilitated by this fault more than 160 mya resulted in a flood of moat volcanics that covered much of New Hampshire. The Belknap Mountains as observed today are the remnants of erosion of those volcanics and the metamorphic rocks underneath them, together representing about in depth. As described in detail by Long, contemporary features of the Belknap Mountains include the former magma chamber, and inner and outer ring dike formations that surround collapsed blocks of Devonian rocks and moat volcanics. Mineral and rock assemblages of the Belknap Mountains reveal a complex geological history, as recorded in the greatest variety of igneous rock in the White Mountains region.

The Carte Jaune or Yellow Card is an international certificate of vaccination (ICV). It is issued by the World Health Organization. It is recognised internationally and may be required for entry to certain countries where there are increased health risks for travellers. The Yellow Card should be kept in the holder's passport, as it is a medical passport of sorts. Note that the example shown here is the American version of the WHO-ICV, issued by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It is available through the Government Printing Office. The original ICV printed and distributed by WHO is found in two versions: 1) English - French (bilingual) or 2) English - French - Arabic (trilingual). These WHO versions do not have pages to show medical contraindication to vaccination, personal health history, state of health, medical treatments, known sensitivities, medications taken regularly, and ophthalmic information. The WHO versions are available from the WHO Bookstore, and they can be ordered in quantities of 5,000 or more, for overprint. The Yellow Fever section is the most important part of the certificate. Other variants of the Yellow Fever certificate are valid only if the card follows the standardized format, and has been officially approved by WHO. There has been a revision in the format, title and the rules on the 2007 issue. It is now called, \\"International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis\\", and the overprint service is no longer available. Filling out the card The vaccine certificate has columns to fill out with dates, nature of vaccine, dose, and physician's signatures. The date must be in the order of DD/MM/YYYY. It is common to see the physician complete the certificate using product name alone, and not indicate the \\"nature\\" of the vaccine. In order to make the certificate \\"international\\", it is strongly advised that the physician also mentions this (i.e. \\"Havrix 1440 El.U.\\" instead of \\"Havrix\\" alone), since the brand name may vary in different parts of the world. It will also help if this is accompanied with the lot number, since the number and the signature together will improve the authenticity of the certificate, as well as reporting when unexpected accidents or illnesses happen. If the physician is willing to put his/her practice address and telephone information, it is best practice that the address also include the country name, and the phone number starting with the country code. The physician must understand that the card is used internationally and not many people outside of a country would know the American or other state names, country codes, and accreditations. Additionally, for those medical professionals from countries not used to sign and indicate their own name, but only clarify the institute name and a stamp, it is advisable that recipients (patients) to request a signature and name on the certificate, as this may alter the relevance of it. The International Certificate of Vaccination (ICV) was revised in 2007 and approved by http://WHO.int to include not just the vaccination card but also the additional sections listed in this article. If your physician does not have a supply of the International Certificate of Vaccination, they may be ordered directly from the Government Printing Office at http://bookstore.gpo.gov/catalog/health-benefits/immunization- vaccination/vaccination-forms or you might conduct a search on form \\"CDC 731\\" to find other vendors. Availability of vaccinations A typical doctor's office will not keep travel vaccinations in stock, so it is best to talk to your primary care physician about where to receive travel medications. For travel to developing countries, many vaccinations may be required, and it is best to refer to either the World Health Organization (WHO) , Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or other national or international health websites for current requirements. One must be aware that not all vaccines for preventable diseases are listed as recommendations, due to the approval status in that country the information originates (i.e. Cholera (inactivated oral vaccine) in the United States of America). It is certainly wise for one to research information from other countries of the languages one understands, and that the information derives from reliable authorities and scientific/medical evidence and statistics. Vaccines=Mandatory Currently, the only universally required vaccination is yellow fever. In countries where it is not required for entry, it may be a good idea to get the vaccination if travelling to endemic zones. After the primary immunisation, boosters are required in ten-year intervals. One must receive this vaccination at least ten days prior to travel. For some countries, the cholera vaccine may be required despite the fact that the World Health Organization does not state this in their regulations. To avoid being quarantined or denied entry, check the entry requirements for the country by contacting the embassy or consulate, especially if there is a current cholera outbreak. Because it is not a universally required vaccination, one may need a separate cholera certificate or a physician's signed statement saying that the vaccine is contraindicated for certain health conditions. On the Yellow Card, the International Certificate of Vaccination or Revaccination Against Yellow Fever (Certificat International de Vaccination ou de Revaccination Contre la Fi√®vre Jaune) is located on the first two pages (in the original WHO version, 3rd and 4th pages) inside of the card. The certificate requires the date of vaccination, the signature and professional status of the vaccinator (signature et titre du vaccinateur), the manufacturer and batch number of the vaccine (fabricant du vaccin et num√©ro du lot), and the official stamp of the vaccinating centre (cachet officiel du centre vaccination). In order for the certificate to be valid, the vaccination centre must be approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). Routine Citizens of developed countries have most likely received their initial doses of the following: *tetanus and diphtheria (Td) *pertussis (whooping cough) *measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) *polio Travellers will most likely need to receive boosters of these, as many people in North America do not regularly update their shots and may be susceptible to these diseases, particularly measles, polio and pertussis . For these additional vaccinations, there is another page in the Yellow Card that is located on the inside of the book under the traveller's information. Required information for these vaccinations includes the date of vaccination, the vaccine/prophylactic drug (vaccin/m√©dicament prophylactique), the dosage, and the physician's signature (signature du m√©decin). Immediately below this table is a form for medical contraindications to vaccinations (contre- indictation m√©dicale √† la vaccination). This form must include the reason why the person is medically contraindicated for a particular vaccine. Others Although the following are not required for entry to any country, they may be recommended dependent on destination, purpose of travel, duration of travel, or level of anticipated contact with locals. *meningococcal meningitis *Japanese encephalitis *hepatitis B *hepatitis A *typhoid *cholera (oral, inactivated) *tick-borne encephalitis In addition to these, it is recommended that travellers receive medication for traveller's diarrhoea because of the risk of water-borne pathogens. For those travelling to endemic areas, malaria chemoprophylaxis are recommended; both of these can be prescribed by a physician or nurse practitioner. Personal health history The centre of the card has a very important section about the health of the traveller. Although not mandatory to fill out, in case of emergency, it may be helpful for the physician who will treat the traveller. The information in this includes: *Name and sex of the traveller *Date of birth *Name, address and phone number of a person to notify in case of emergency () *Blood group and Rh type () *Name and address of physician (nom et addresse du m√©decin) *State of health, medical treatments or known sensitivities () For people who have allergic reactions to things like eggs and latex, it is very important to fill out the last section. Medications taken regularly For those who take regular medications such as insulin and digoxin (digitalis), the section of medications taken regularly (m√©dicaments pris r√©guli√®rement) may be required to bring said medications into foreign countries. There are five required sections of this table: *health problem (probl√®me de sant√©) *generic and trade names of medication (noms g√©n√©riques et commerciaux du m√©dicament) *medication dosage (dosage du m√©dicament) *physician's remarks (remarques du m√©decin) *physician's signature (signature du m√©decin) Ophthalmic information People who wear glasses should have their ophthalmologist fill out the section for prescription glasses in case damage occurs to them. Just as on normal eye prescriptions, there should be information about each eye (ocular dexter/oculaire droit, ocular sinister/oculaire gauche) along with information about the sphere (sph√®re), cylinder (cylindre), axis (axe), prism (prisme) and base.

Just after defeating the Phoenicians and destructing the city of Carthage in nowadays Tunisia during the Punic Wars, the Roman armies took possession of Mauretania and divided it into two provinces. In the west, Mauritania Tingitana was developed by the creation of roads, agricultural innovations and trade expansions. In the mountainous areas, the Berber tribes resisted to the Roman invasions. The Roman influence will be preserved in the south until 285 AD.

The battle was between the Moroccan Sultan Abu Abdallah Mohammed II, and his ally, the King of Portugal Sebastian I, against a large Moroccan army nominally under the new Sultan of Morocco (and uncle of Abu Abdallah Mohammed II) Abd Al-Malik I. The Christian king, Sebastian I, had other plans, and planned a takeover, and crusade. The defeat of Portugal and attendant death of the childless Sebastian led to the end of the Aviz dynasty in effect portugal of then, and the only choice was the integration of the country in the Iberian Union for 60 years under the Philippine Dynasty in a dynastic union with Spain. over 8000 portuguese deaths, 15000 captured, it was a disastrous campaign, that ended the portuguese dynasty, and to survive it had to join with Spain. Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir Barbary wars Though Morocco was not part of the Ottoman empire, Moroccan pirates held their activities in both the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic ocean. They used two main ports as bases; Sal√© and T√©touan. Sal√© pirates roamed the seas as far as the shores of the Americas, bringing back loot and slaves. The character Robinson Crusoe, in Daniel Defoe's novel by the same name, sailed off from the mouth of the Bou Regreg river. treaty of friendship sealed by Mohammed III of Morocco, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams In 1783 the United States made peace with and was recognized by Great Britain, and in 1784 the first American ship was captured by pirates from Morocco. The stars and stripes was a new flag to them. After six months of negotiation, a treaty of friendship between the U.S. and Morocco was signed, $60,000 cash was paid, and trade began. Morocco was the first independent nation to recognize the United States back in 1778. Franco-Moroccan Wars=First Franco-Moroccan Wars The First Franco-Moroccan War consisted of a series of conflicts fought between France and its colonial administrators on one side, and the sultanate of Morocco on the other. The principal cause of war involved the retreat of Algerian resistance leader \`Abd al-QƒÅdir into Morocco following French victories over many of his tribal supporters in the French conquest of Algeria. The name of the conflict can be misleading however, seeing the first conflict between the two nations took place during the Larache expedition, after the Seven Years' War. Second Franco-Moroccan Wars The Second Franco-Moroccan War took place in 1911, when Moroccan forces besieged the French-occupied city of Fez. Approximately one month later, French forces brought the siege to an end. On March 30, 1912, Sultan AbdelHafid signed the Treaty of Fez, formally ceding Moroccan sovereignty to France, which established a protectorate. On April 17, 1912, Moroccan infantrymen mutinied in the French garrison in Fez. The Moroccans were unable to take the city and were defeated by a French relief force. In late May 1912, Moroccan forces unsuccessfully attacked the enhanced French garrison at Fez. Spanish-Moroccan warResistance against colonialism= Zaian War The Rif warsIfni War=Use of Moroccan recruits by the colonial forces During the period of the French protectorate of Morocco (1912‚Äì1956) large numbers of Moroccans were recruited for service in the Spahi and Tirailleur regiments of the French Army of Africa. During World War II more than 300,000 Moroccan troops (including goumier auxiliaries) served with the Free French forces in North Africa, Italy, France and Austria. The two world conflicts saw Moroccan units earning the nickname of \\"Todesschwalben\\" (death swallows) by German soldiers as they showed particular toughness on the battlefield . By the end of the World War II, Moroccan troops took part of the French Expeditionary Force engaged in the First Indochina War from 1946 to 1954. The Spanish Army also made extensive use of Moroccan troops recruited in the Spanish Protectorate, during both the Rif War of 1921-26 and the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39. Moroccan Regulares, together with the Spanish Legion, made up Spain's elite Spanish Army of Africa. A para-military gendarmerie, known as the \\"Mehal-la Jalifianas\\" and modelled on the French goumieres, was employed within the Spanish Zone. The Sand War Before the French colonization in the 19th century, parts of southern and western Algeria belonged to Morocco.Security Problems with Neighboring States - Countrystudies.us In the 1930s and later in the 1950s, France had integrated into what was known as the Overseas D√©partement of French Algeria, the areas of Tindouf and Bechar. When Morocco gained independence in 1956, it wanted to reassert sovereignty over these areas. In an effort to cut the support that the Front de Lib√©ration Nationale (FLN) was getting from Morocco, France offered to return those areas in exchange for Morocco stopping that support. King Mohammed V refused to make a deal with France behind the back of the \\"Algerian brothers\\", and agreed with the Algerian provisional government's nationalist leader Ferhat Abbas, that once Algeria gained its independence it would renegotiate the status of the Tindouf and Bechar areas. However, immediately after Algeria's independence, and before his agreement with the Moroccan King Muhammad V could be formally ratified, the first Algerian provisional president Ferhat Abbas was purged from the FLN government by a military-backed coalition led by the first Algerian provisional president Ahmad Ben Bella. Ben Bella reneged on the deal that Ferhat Abbas agreed to.

Preciado is the 485th fugitive to be placed on the list. After nine years on the run, Preciado was captured in Mexico on July 17, 2009 and is currently serving a 25-year to life prison sentence. The earliest year for parole is 2032.  Criminal career  Preciado has a documented history as a gang member in the South Side Whittier street gang, which operates outside of Los Angeles. Preciado is a career criminal who has been arrested for a 1992 murder, robbery, grand theft and receipt of stolen property. He has been convicted of narcotics and firearms violations. At the time of the shooting, he was on parole for a drug-related crime.  Shooting of Michael Schaap  On September 5, 2000 Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy Michael Schaap and his partner, David Timberlake, were on patrol when they saw a 1979 Chevrolet van traveling toward them. As the van approached, the deputies noticed the van's headlights were not functioning properly and proceeded to stop the driver of the vehicle. When the van came to an abrupt stop, the deputies came under immediate attack from a burst of automatic gunfire. The gunman, one of four occupants traveling in the vehicle, appeared from an open door in the van and began shooting the deputies. Deputy Timberlake escaped without injury. A bullet fragment from his assailant's AK-47 blasted into the bridge above Schaap's nose, ricocheted across his forehead and exited above his right eye. During surgery, doctors removed the remaining fragments of the bullet from Schaap's head, leaving a small wound, a horseshoe-shaped scar on his face and his left side partially paralyzed. Schaap had a long, painful recovery, which included intense therapy to re- learn cognitive skills. Three other men in the car, Carlos Albert Gutierrez, Jose Leonchio Guardado and Omar Jimenez were arrested, charged and convicted of the shooting, but the fourth man remained at large. The alleged shooter was later identified as Emigdio Preciado Jr, and he became a suspect of the case. In 2001, Schaap returned to work with an assignment to handle administrative duties and teach employment issues to his department. In an interview he expressed his wishes for justice and a fair trial to Preciado if he were to be captured.  Fugitive  In December 2000, Preciado was spotted and videotaped dancing in a town holiday festival in Tepuzhuacan, Nayarit, Mexico. Billboards profiling Preciado were installed in Whittier. Preciado was seen again in 2006 in Guadalajara, Mexico, and it was alleged that his family members or fellow gang members could have helped him evade authorities. Preciado had surgically removed his distinctive tattoos in Mexico. On March 14, 2007 he was named by the FBI as the 485th fugitive to be placed on the Ten Most Wanted list. The shooting case was reviewed several times on the television show America's Most Wanted. There was a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to his capture being offered, but it was increased to $150,000, with the FBI offering a $100,000 reward, and the Los Angeles County Supervisor's Office offering an additional $50,000. The reward will be paid to the tipster who helped Preciado's capture.  Capture, extradition, and conviction  Preciado was captured in the hills near Corral Piedras, a rural area near Yagos, in Nayarit, Mexico on July 17, 2009. He had been living there, using the alias Regalo Castaneda-Castaneda and working as a fisherman. Preciado was held in the custody of Mexican federal police and transferred to Mexico City, from where he was extradited to Los Angeles on January 12, 2010 in order to face trial. Preciado was set for arraignment in Whittier Superior Court and his hearing was proceeded on February 19. In July 2011, Preciado accepted a plea agreement and was immediately sentenced to 25 years in prison. During what was scheduled to be a preliminary hearing leading up to a trial, Preciado pleaded guilty to two counts of assault with a deadly weapon on peace officers, as well as the special allegation of using a firearm in a felony. The former FBI Top Ten Most Wanted fugitive will need to serve at least 85% of this sentence before being eligible for parole, meaning the soonest he can hope to be paroled is in the year 2032.

Such a complex is said to pursue its own financial interests regardless of, and often at the expense of, the best interests of society and individuals. Businesses within an industrial complex may have been created to advance a social or political goal, but mostly profit when the goal is not reached. The industrial complex may profit financially from maintaining socially detrimental or inefficient systems.  History  The concept was popularized by President Dwight Eisenhower in his Jan. 17, 1961 farewell speech. Eisenhower described a \\"threat to democratic government\\" called the military industrial complex. This complex involved the military establishment gaining \\"unwarranted influence\\" over the economic, political, and spiritual realms of American society due to the profitability of the US arms industry and the number of citizens employed in various branches of military service, the armaments industry, and other businesses providing goods to the US army. The \\"complex\\" arises from the creation of a multilateral economy serving military goals, as well as the paradox that arises from the goal of the multilateralism (sustained profit) as antithetical to the military's theoretical goal (peace).  Uses  In many cases, the industrial complex refers to a conflict of interest between an institution's purported socio-political purpose and the financial interests of the businesses and government agencies that profit from the pursuit of such purpose, when achieving the stated purpose would result in a financial loss for those businesses. For example, the purported purpose of the US penal system is to assist offenders in becoming law abiding citizensyet the prison industrial complex subsists upon high inmate populations, thus relying on the penal system's failure to meet its goal of criminal reform and re-entry. In these types of cases, government agencies are often thought to profit financially from institutional industrialization, perhaps eroding their motivation to legislate such institutions in ways that may be socially beneficial. The industrial complex concept has also been used informally to denote the artificial creation, inflation, or manipulation of an institution's societal value in order to increase profit opportunities, especially through specialty businesses and niche products. An example of this is the marriage industrial complex, where demand for wedding dress makers, wedding venues, wedding planners, wedding cake bakers, wedding rentals companies, wedding photographers, etc, is created by the perceived social necessity of an elaborate wedding ceremony.  Examples  Within the military-industrial complex, businesses that supply the army with uniforms, artillery, etc, profit from the continuation of war and will be hurt by peace. Within the prison- industrial complex, businesses access labor from prisoners that is cheaper than civilian labor, thus they profit from high incarceration rates. Within the medical-industrial complex, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies require patients to be sick, thus business interests are at odds with the goal of making people healthy.

The \\"Andrex Puppy\\", a Labrador Retriever puppy that appears on the company's television adverts, is synonymous with the brand. The brand Andrex is also used by Kimberly-Clark in the Hong Kong market, with products from their Taiwanese factories (though wet wipes are imported from South Korea),https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2833146663638598&id;=1375070776112868https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2715883912031541&id;=1375070776112868 along with the brands Scott, Kleenex and Scottie. Its sister brand in the U.S. and Australia is Kleenex Cottonelle. In Austria it is called \\"Hakle,\\" and in Germany simply Cottonelle. In The Netherlands, Andrex is known as Page. In Belgium, Italy, Spain and Portugal it is branded as Scottex. In South Africa, it is branded as Baby Soft. In Australia, the puppy is known as the \\"Kleenex Puppy\\" and Kleenex is a partner and supporter of Guide Dogs Australia. History Andrex was originally developed in 1942 by paper manufacturer St Andrew Mills Ltd., as a disposable handkerchief. Harrods department store in London sold the handkerchiefs exclusively. Before Andrex, brands such as Bronco and Izal produced products that were harsher. They were mainly sold through chemists and known as ‚Äúshinies‚Äù. The name Andrex comes from St Andrew Mill, on St Andrews Road in Walthamstow, where the toilet tissue was first made. The concept of two ply luxury paper had been inspired by the facial tissues used by American women, as witnessed by the man who created the name Andrex, Ronald Keith Kent. It was the first two-ply tissue. St Andrew Mills was taken-over by Bowater in 1955, and in 1956, Bowater formed a joint venture with the Scott Paper Company, Bowater-Scott, that specialized in tissue products, including Andrex. One of the most popular TV ads in the UK almost did not happen. The original idea in 1972 was for a girl to run through a house trailing a roll of Andrex. The television regulators did not approve this as they felt it encouraged children to be wasteful. Bowater-Scott's Marketing Director, Raymond Dinkin decided to use a Labrador puppy instead. Since then there have been 130 different adverts featuring the puppy. In 1986, Bowater sold Bowater-Scott to Scott Paper, and in 1995, Kimberly-Clark purchased Scott Paper. Andrex says that it marketed the first moist toilet paper in 1992. In 2004, Andrex replaced its advertising slogan ‚ÄúSoft, Strong and very very Long‚Äù, with ‚ÄúTuggable, Huggable softness‚Äù, and changed to ‚ÄúBe Kind To Your Behind‚Äù in 2008. By 2015, it was using the slogans ‚ÄúAndrex clean‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow Andrex do you feel?‚Äù Operations All Andrex mainstream is made in Northfleet. Factories in Flint and Barrow in Furness supplement production on the mainline product, along with the Puppies on a Roll, Aloe Vera and Quilts variations.

The LP was catalog number 555 on the label. The album was recorded at Bell Sound Studios in New York City and was produced in full by Burt Bacharach and Hal David. History It was Warwick's first Scepter album to make the Top 20, reaching 18th on the pop charts, and also her first album to be certified by the RIAA as a gold award winner in the U.S.A. signifying sales of over 500,000 copies. It also reached #1 on the R&B; albums chart. The album featured cover art which did not feature Warwick at all. A sunset covered this album, with two lovers at the bottom of the photograph. Two of Warwick's hit singles from 1966 were included on the album: \\"Trains and Boats and Planes\\" and \\"I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself\\". Of note was Warwick's version of \\"Alfie\\", which became Warwick's signature song after she was selected to perform it at the Academy Awards the following year. This version became a bigger Top 40 hit than any of the 40-plus versions that had previously been recorded, peaking at #15 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #5 on the Billboard R&B; Chart.

In the 1860s, Chinese laborers helped build the Central Pacific Railroad in the United States. Early efforts The opening of the short-lived Woosung Road, the first railway in China, between Shanghai and Wusong in 1876. In 1865, a British merchant built a 600-meter long narrow gauge railroad outside the Xuanwu Gate in Beijing to demonstrate the technology to the imperial court.(Chinese) Êù®ÂæÅ, \\"ÊòîÊó•Âåó‰∫¨ÂüéÁöÑËΩ®ÈÅì‰∫§ÈÄöÔºöÂ§©ÂùõÁÅ´ËΩ¶Á´ôÂè™Áî®‰∫Ü‰∏§Âπ¥\\" Âåó‰∫¨ÊôöÊä• 2016-03-30(Chinese) ÂÜØÂäõÂº∫Ôºå ÂÜØÂÜ†Ë±™, Á∫¢Ëâ≤ËÆ∞ÂøÜÔºö‰∏≠‰∏úÈìÅË∑Ø‰∏äÁöÑ‰∏≠ÂõΩÊ¢¶ Beijing Book Co.

The first railroad to operate commercially in China opened in Shanghai in July 1876. The railway, known as the Woosung Road, ran from the American Concession in the present-day Zhabei District to Woosung in the present-day Baoshan District and was built by the British trading firm, Jardine, Matheson and Co. Construction took place without approval from the Qing government, which had paid 285,000 taels of silver for the railroad and had it dismantled in October 1877. Hong Kong Railway Society website - English version, under Member's Corner : Feature ArticlesWoosung Road ‚Äì the story of China‚Äôs First Railway‚Äù by Peter Crush, published Hong Kong 1999 () The rails and rolling stock were later shipped to Taiwan. In late 1884, Jardine, Matheson arranged a loan of 500 million taels of silver to the Chinese government in late 1884 \\"for the purpose of building railways\\". The first railway to endure was the Kaiping Tramway and Imperial Railways of North China. Initially, a 10 kilometre (6.2 mi) line from Tangshan to Xugezhuang built in 1881 to transport coal from the coal mine in Tangshan, this line was extended to Tianjin in 1888 and Shanhaiguan and Suizhong in 1894. This railway became known as the \\"Guanneiwai Railway\\" (literally, inner and outer Shanhaiguan railway). The railway was backed by the powerful Viceroy of Zhili, Li Hongzhang, who overcame objections from conservative ministers. To secure the support of the Empress Dowager for railway construction, Li Hongzhang imported a small train set from Germany and built a narrow gauge railway from her residence in Zhongnanhai to her dining hall in Beihai in 1888. The Empress, concerned that the locomotive's noise would disturb the geomancy or fengshui of the imperial city, required the train be pulled by eunuchs instead of steam engine. The next effort was made by Taiwan Governor Liu Mingchuan. From 1887 to 1893, of railway tracks were laid from Keelung to Taipei to Hsinchu. However, this railway was later demolished for modernization when Taiwan was under Japanese rule. Rapid development during 1895-1911 The Faux Namti Bridge on the Yunnan‚ÄìVietnam Railway was built by France in 1906. A train on South Manchuria Railway Qing China's defeat in the First Sino- Japanese War greatly stimulated the railway development as the government both recognized the importance of modernization and was compelled by foreign powers to grant concessions to build railways along with settlement and mineral rights. The imperial powers then took to building railways in their spheres of influence. The railroads already built in 1900 had a total length of only 292 miles. Another 4000 miles were in the planning stage.Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year 1901 (1902) p 151. The British built the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway (1905-1908) and Kowloon-Canton Railway (completed 1911). The French built the Sino-Vietnamese Railway (1904‚Äì10), an 855 km line to connect Kunming with Vietnam, then a colony of French Indochina. The Germans built the Jiaoji Railway in Shandong Province. British and German industrialists jointly built the Tianjin‚ÄìPukou Railway. The Americans built the Canton - Sam Shui Railway in Guangdong in 1902‚Äì04. Czarist Russia built the China Eastern Railway (1897-1901) as a shortcut for the Trans-Siberian Railway and the Southern Manchuria Railway to Port Arthur. To prevent domination by bigger powers, the Qing Court gave the rights to the Lugouqiao-Hankou Railway to Belgians. The Japanese initially received numerous concessions along the coast of Fujian and Guangdong, and built the Chao Chow and Swatow Railway (1904‚Äì06). After winning the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, the Japanese took over the southern section of the China Eastern Railway (from Changchun to Port Arthur) and the entire Southern Manchuria Railway. By 1911, there were around 9,000 km of rails in China. Most of the rails used the . Map showing early railway expansion in China. Hankou Dazhimen Station, the original southern terminal of the Jinghan Railway The imperial capital, Beijing, was designed as the center of the Chinese railway network. Several lines radiated out from Beijing. Three main lines are Beijing-Hankou Railway, Beijing-Fengtian Railway, and Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Jinghan railway was from eh Beijing to Hankou. The construction started in 1897 and was completed in 1906. The Guangneiwai railway was extended west to Beijing and east to Fengtian by 1912 and renamed as Beijing-Fengtian Railway. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway, built from 1908-1912\\\\. It ran from Tianjin, which was connected by the Beijing-Fengtian Railway, to Pukou across the Yangtze River from Nanjing. Railway protection movement and the Xinhai Revolution Zhan Tianyou, the \\"father of China's railways\\" The rapid expansion of foreign railroad ownership and operation in China aroused strong public resentment and led to calls for domestic development of railways. To help local economies develop and retain earnings from railways, the Qing government in 1904 permitted local provinces to organize their own railway companies and raise funds by selling shares to the public. From 1904‚Äì1907, 15 provincial governments formed their own railway building companies and raised funds by selling shares to citizens and levying taxes. The Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway built from 1905‚Äì09, was the first railway to be designed and built indigenously. The chief engineer was Zhan Tianyou, who is known as the Father of China's Railways. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, 189 km in length and completed in 1909, was financed by the provincial governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.Travelling By Train In China The Zhengding-Taiyuan Railway, originally planned to run from Zhengding County in Hebei Province, was routed from Shijiazhuang instead and opened in 1907. In 1911, when some of the provincial railway ventures fell into bankruptcy, the foreign powers pressed the Qing government to permit them to take over the ventures. In May 1911, the Qing government sought to nationalize these locally controlled railway companies and pledge their railway concessions to foreign banks in exchange for loans. The nationalization order provoked fierce public opposition that led to the Railway Protection Movement, which contributed to the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution. Troops sent to Sichuan from neighboring Hubei weakened defenses in Wuhan where revolutionaries launched the Wuchang Uprising. The ensuing Xinhai Revolution toppled the Qing Dynasty. Republic of China After founding the Republic of China on January 1, 1912, Dr. Sun Yat-sen agreed to cede the provisional presidency to Yuan Shikai in exchange for the latter's assistance in securing the abdication of Qing court. Sun believed that a national railway network was key to the modernization of China. He sought and received from Yuan Shikai, the portfolio of railway development for the new republic. From 1928 to 1937, the Republican government in Nanjing built 3,600 km of railway inside the Great Wall. Manchuria, located beyond the wall, had 900 km of railways built from 1928 until 1931, when the region was captured by Japan. World War II The Longhai Railway bombed during the Second Sino-Japanese War During the Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937‚Äì1945, the Republican government dismantled a number of railways to slow the Japanese advance and added 1,900 km of railways, mostly in the interior of China after coastal regions were occupied. Among the completed lines were the Longhai Railway (Lingbao-Tongguan and Xi'an-Baoji sections), Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway (Hangzhou-Pingxiang section) and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway (Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section). The Shanxi warlord Yan Xishan built the narrow gauge Datong-Puzhou Railway across Shanxi Province. The Japanese occupiers, using forced labor, built 5,700 km of railway in Manchuria and Rehe Province and 900 km of railway in China Proper. In 1941, construction began of the Yunnan Burma Railway, an attempt to link British occupied Burma with Kunming in Yunnan province. Ultimately, however, the project was aborted. 1945-1949 In 1945, just after the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese mainland had 27,000 km of rail, and it was estimated about 23,000 km was usable. By 1948, the number of usable kilometers of rail was estimated at only 8,000 km due to the Chinese Civil War. The Communists actively sabotaged rail lines to disrupt the ruling Nationalists (Kuomintang), and the Nationalists scavenged lesser used railways in order to repair the most important ones.Norton S. Ginsburg, Geographical Review, Vol. 41, No. 3 (Jul., 1951), pp. 470-474 People's Republic of China Opening ceremony of the Chengdu‚ÄìChongqing Railway, the first railway built in China after 1949. In 1951, after extensive investment in reconstruction, the Communists, who established the People's Republic of China (PRC) in October 1949, had restored the usable network to about 22,000 km. Most of the early reconstruction (about 11,000 km) was in Manchuria because Soviet and Japanese occupation there reduced the amount of sabotage between the fighting parties, allowing for quick repairs. On October 14, 1949, the cross-border service on the Kowloon- Canton Railway was suspended as a result of the communist revolution, and it was not resumed until April 4, 1979. A train on Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge - a first fixed railway link across the river In fact, when the PRC was established in 1949, China had constructed 27,380 km of railway, but only 24,090 km was kept, including 10,309 km in the northeastern part of China, and 919 km in Taiwan.‰∏≠ÂúãÈêµË∑Ø1863Ôºç1949:Âú®ÊÑöÊòß„ÄÅÂ∞àÂà∂„ÄÅ‰æµÁï•‰∏ãÊéôÊâé(‰∏Ä), Ë¢ÅÂÅâÊôÇ Railway construction in the 1950s The end to decades of warfare in China allowed railway construction to proceed on a large scale. In the 1950s, the government initiated numerous railway building projects to fill in missing links in the country's rail network. The new government undertook a vigorous railway building campaign. From 1952, when the first railway of the People's Republic, the Chengdu‚ÄìChongqing Railway entered operation, to the end of the First Five Year Plan in 1957, of railroads were built, accounting for 18% of the national total. The lines completed during this period include the final sections of the Longhai and Xianggui Railways, the Litang‚ÄìZhanjiang, Yingtan‚ÄìXiamen, Lancun‚ÄìYantai and Xiaoshan‚ÄìNingbo Railways. These lines, along with the Baoji‚ÄìChengdu Railway (completed in 1958) and the 1,900 km Lanzhou‚ÄìXinjiang Railway to Urumqi (completed in 1962), extended the national rail network to the Northwest and Southwest, and added connections between the coast and interior. In 1957, passenger trains averaged 34.8 km/h and freight trains averaged 25.2 km/h. The Great Leap Forward Map of China's railway network in 1961 The launch of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 was intended to rapidly expand railway transport, but produced counterproductive results. The shipment of freight, which was not quite 300 million tons in 1957, was targeted to reach 900 million tons by 1959 and 3 billion tons by 1972. The length of newly planned railways rose from 20,000 km to 70,000, and 120,000 km over the next 15 years. To reach these targets, the railroads were pushed beyond their capacity. Without experimentation, freight trains on all major lines increased carrying load from 2,700 tons to 3,600 tons without adding power to locomotives. This caused trains to backslide on slopes, damage to rolling stock and steam engines to dry boil. On time rates fell precipitously. The railways did set new records, 1.4 billion passenger rides and 1.5 billion tons of freight delivered in the three years between 1958 and 1960, some 200 million passengers and 0.5 billion tons more than the five years from 1953 to 1958, but the freight load fell to 345 million tons in 1962. The economic disclocation caused by the Great Leap Forward slowed down railway construction. Numerous lines such as the Dazhou-Chengdu Railway were delayed for decades as a result. Rail operations were revamped in 1961 and performance improved. In 1965, freight carried reached 480 million tons and the system set a new record for net income. The Sino-Soviet split prompted the leadership to shift railway building toward the \\"Third Line\\", in the mountainous regions of the interior, away from the east coast and Soviet border. Cultural Revolution The launch of the Cultural Revolution in 1966 brought political turmoil to the country and disruptions to railway operations. In the fall of 1966, by Chairman Mao's edict, the Red Guards from around the country could travel on trains for free. To prevent political factional fighting to spread into the railways, the national railways were assigned to the command of the military in the summer of 1967. Railway management and operations, nevertheless, slipped rapidly. Accident rates rose 25% from 1966 to 1967, and another 20% from 1967 to 1968. Premier Zhou Enlai and other moderate leaders pushed back against leftist-radical management of the railway and operations began to improve in 1969. In 1973, the system shipped 800 million tons, a new record. In 1974, however, the Gang of Four with the Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius Campaign, reasserted the leftist line and railway performance plummted again. From the summer of 1974 to early 1975, railway hubs in Xuzhou, Changsha, Guiyang, and Baotou experienced freight bottlenecks. In April 1975, Deng Xiaoping took control of the leadership and directed the railways to focus on productivity and safety. In April 1975, the railways' coal carrying targets were met for the first time in nearly five years. In early 1976, after Deng Xiaoping was removed from power and the Gang of Four reasserted control, railway performance declined again. Compared to 1975, freight fell by 46.3 million tons year-on-year, accidents rose by 17% and tax revenues paid to the state fell by 740 million. Despite the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution and slowdown in rail construction at home, the Chinese Railway Ministry and the Rail Corps managed to build a 1,860 km railway across Tanzania and Zambia. The TAZARA Railway was by far the largest foreign aid project undertaken by China in Africa. As many as 56,000 Chinese engineers and workers were sent overseas from 1968 to 1975. After the Cultural Revolution ended and the economic reforms were launched in 1978, the railways were reorganized and rededicated to improving safety, performance, technology and profitability. These principles have guided the railway's operations in the decades since. In 1998, passenger trains averaged 54.5 km/h and freight trains averaged 31.8 km/h. Slowdown in the 1980s After China initiated market-oriented economic reforms in 1978, railway building slowed as state funds were directed toward higher return investments. It was not until the 1990s, after more than a decade of economic growth, that the state could commit the funds to renew large-scale railway building. Railway building boom since 1990 In 1990, the Lanxin Railway was extended by the Northern Xinjiang Railway to the Kazakh border. In 1999, the Southern Xinjiang Railway brought railway service to Kashgar in the far west. The railway to Tibet however, was more difficult to build due to the high altitude and terrain. Rail lines were first extended to Xining in Qinghai, and by 1984 another section between Xining and Golmud was completed. It was not until 2006 that the whole of the Qingzang railway was finished, linking Lhasa with rest of China. Since then, every province-level entity in the People's Republic of China has a railway network. End of the steam era A steam locomotive and a diesel locomotive near the Badaling Great Wall in Beijing in 1979. Before the 1980s, due to the low labor cost, ease of manufacture, and cheap coal price, steam locomotives dominated the Chinese railways. During the 1980s and 90s, diesel and electric locomotives gradually replaced steam engines on the main lines. On some provincial rails, however, steam locomotives were not retired until the 21st century. In December 2005, the world's last regular revenue mainline steam train finished its journey on the Jitong railway, marking the end of the steam era. Nevertheless, there are still some steam locomotives used on the industrial railways in China. As a part of infrastructure upgrade, China in 2007 opened its first high-speed rail lines using trains with origins in Canada, France, Germany and Japan.

In 1972 the WHA came into existence and the upstart league was stealing from the NHL both their superstars and players to simply fill their rosters. Lawson made the jump and signed with the Philadelphia Blazers. Although having had a five-year career in the NHL under his belt, it was not until moving to the WHA that his scoring abilities were fully realized. In the WHA‚Äôs inaugural season, despite the presence of superstar Bobby Hull, it was Lawson who on February 22 became the first player to score 50 goals. Playing on a line with Don Herriman and Andre Lacroix, by season‚Äôs end he led the league in goals with 61. Lawson capped that season by being selected to the WHA All Star Team's First Team. Lawson remained a star in the WHA, almost entirely with the Blazers' franchise through moves from Philadelphia to Vancouver and finally to Calgary. Midway through the 1977 season he was traded to the Winnipeg Jets and reached the Avco Cup final, where the Jets lost to the Quebec Nordiques, after which Lawson retired. In the NHL, Lawson appeared in 219 games, scoring 28 goals and 29 assists. However, in the WHA he played in 392 games, scoring 218 goals and adding 204 assists. Despite not participating in the final two seasons of the WHA's existence he still finished at #8 in all-time WHA goals. Post NHL In August 1986, at age 39, Lawson attempted a comeback in the NHL, attending the Edmonton Oilers training camp, but was released by the club in September. Lawson then found employment in German hockey. For the 1986-87 season he played with the third division team EC Hedos Munich helping the team move up to the second division. The next season, he coached SV Bayreuth and the team finished fourth out of ten teams in the southern division. On September 15, 2008, Lawson died of cancer. Honours In 2010, he was elected as an inaugural inductee into the World Hockey Association Hall of Fame.WHA Hall of Fame Members ReferencesExternal links * * Complete Stats * Profile from Legends of Hockey * Photo Category:1947 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Buffalo Sabres players Category:Calgary Cowboys players Category:Canadian ice hockey right wingers Category:Cleveland Barons (1937‚Äì1973) players Category:Detroit Red Wings players Category:Fort Worth Wings players Category:Hamilton Red Wings (OHA) players Category:Sportspeople from Toronto Category:Iowa Stars (CHL) players Category:Minnesota North Stars players Category:Philadelphia Blazers players Category:Vancouver Blazers players Category:Winnipeg Jets (WHA) players Category:Ice hockey people from Ontario ","title":"Danny Lawson"},{"id":"10090091","text":"Henry Cullen Adams (November 28, 1850 - July 9, 1906) was an American farmer, public administrator, and U.S. Congressman from Wisconsin, best known for his support of pure food laws. Biography Adams was born in Verona, New York, but moved to his father's farm in Jefferson County, Wisconsin, when he was an infant. The family moved again a few years later to southeastern Dane County, Wisconsin. His father, Benjamin F. Adams, was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly for that area and served in the Assembly in 1862 and 1872. Adams attended the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, but withdrew for health reasons before earning a degree. After marrying Anne Burkley Norton in 1878, he operated a successful dairy and fruit farm and served as president of the Wisconsin Dairymen's Association. He was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1882, representing the same geographic area that his father had represented, though the districts had been reapportioned. He was re-elected in 1883 and in 1884--the first year that Assemblymembers were elected to two-year terms. He left office in 1887 and became a member of the Wisconsin Board of Agriculture (1887‚Äì95). He also held the offices of Wisconsin Superintendent of Public Property (1889‚Äì91) and Food and Dairy Commissioner (1898-1902). In 1902, Adams was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district. He served in the 58th United States Congress and was reelected to the 59th Congress serving until his death (March 4, 1903 - July 9, 1906). He was a progressive Republican and supporter of Robert M. \\"Fighting Bob\\" La Follette. In Congress, he worked for passage of the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act. He died of intestinal illness in 1906 in Chicago, while en route from Washington, D.C., to his home in Wisconsin. He is buried in Madison, Wisconsin.

This was the last Disney theatrical cartoon short subject distributed by RKO Radio Pictures.Amazon.com Plot Tourists have departed Brownstone National Park where Humphrey lives, leaving trash everywhere, despite signs asking tourists not to litter the park. The park ranger initially starts to pick it up himself, but then decides that he should not have to do it because he is the boss. He then calls Humphrey and the other resident bears and asks them to \\"put it in the bag\\", while singing and dancing to a catchy song. The bears happily collect the trash, bouncing and jouncing until they discover the ranger's actual motivation. With Humphrey dropping the ranger into a garbage can, the bears angrily dump their bags of refuse on the ground. Realizing that he should at least reward the bears for their assistance, the ranger prepares some chicken cacciatore, but says that he will only give it to the bears on the condition that they clean up their sections of the park. All of the bears then move their garbage into one section, leaving Humphrey to clean it all up himself. He does this quickly by stuffing the garbage into a bag, but as he is returning to receive his dinner, the bag gets caught on the twig of a tree stump and rips apart, letting the garbage out. The ranger then gives him a new bag and Humphrey follows the garbage down the line all the way to a cliff, but falls off as he puts the last scrap in the bag. Next, he attempts to conceal the garbage under a bush, but the bush turns out to be the home of a rabbit, who disgustedly pushes it back out. Humphrey then tries to burn the garbage with a match, but is stopped by Smokey Bear, who reminds him that \\"only you can prevent forest fires.\\" Finally, Humphrey puts all of the trash into a hollow stump, which is actually a geyser named \\"Ol' Fateful\\". The ranger prepares to reward Humphrey with a dish full of cacciatore, but before Humphrey can take it, the geyser suddenly erupts, spouting the garbage everywhere, resulting in Humphrey having to start all over again at cleaning up the park.Internet Archive In the Bag song The catchy tune featured in In The Bag was so popular that Disney released a version of it (with similar instrumentation and different vocals) as a single, \\"The Humphrey Hop.\\" The song was sung again by Woodlore to his Brownstone Bears in a 2002 episode of Disney's House of Mouse, where they serve as the House's \\"clean-up crew.\\" Humphrey Hop (In The Bag)-YouTube The song later appeared in Cars 3 with different lyrics performed by Mater (Larry the Cable Guy).In the Bag (1956)-Connections-IMDB Voice cast * Humphrey the Bear: Jimmy MacDonald * J.

Beet pulp is a byproduct from the processing of sugar beet which is used as fodder for horses and other livestock. Beet pulp is the fibrous material left over after the sugar is extracted from sugar beets. It is supplied either as dried flakes or as compressed pellets, but when fed to horses it should always be soaked in water first.  Composition  Despite being a byproduct of sugar beet processing, beet pulp itself is low in sugar and other non-structural carbohydrates, but high in energy and fiber.Warren, Lori K. \\"Horse Feeding Myths and Misconceptions\\" Horse Industry Section, Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. Web site accessed February 16, 2007 Among other nutrients, it contains 10 percent protein, 0.8 percent calcium and 0.5 percent phosphorus. It has no Vitamin A, so additional forage or supplementation is required to provide complete nutrition. 8,5'-Diferulic acid is the predominant diferulic acid in sugar beet pulp.Dehydrodiferulic acids from sugar-beet pulp. V. Micard, J.H. Grabber, J. Ralph, C.M.G.C. Renard and J-F. Thibault, Phytochemistry, 1997, volume 44, page 1365-1368, Sometimes molasses is added to improve palatability. Feeding Beet pulp is usually fed to horses in addition to hay, but occasionally is a replacement for hay when fed to very old horses who can no longer chew properly. A standard ration of beet pulp for horses is usually dry weight. Before feeding to horses, beet pulp is usually soaked in water, at a ratio of one part pulp to about four parts water. The maximum amount of water is absorbed after three to four hours, but it may be soaked for as little as one to two hours, especially in hot weather when there is a risk of fermentation. Most commercial feeds designed for geriatric horses contain large amounts of beet pulp and are fed straight out of the bag without being soaked, and manufacturer's directions generally recommend giving such feeds dry unless the horse has dental issues that make chewing difficult. Beet pulp is not usually soaked before feeding to cattle, sheep and goats. Dehydrated beet pulp has a good nutritive value for ruminants. It is also fed to poultry, pigs and rabbits.Heuz√© V., Thiollet H., Tran G., Sauvant D., Bastianelli D., Lebas F., 2018. Sugar beet pulp, dehydrated. Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. https://www.feedipedia.org/node/24378 Beet pulp can also be fed wet, pressed or ensiled.Heuz√© V., Thiollet H., Tran G., Sauvant D., Bastianelli D., Lebas F., 2018. Sugar beet pulp, pressed or wet. Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. https://www.feedipedia.org/node/710 Safety issues Some horse owners express two concerns about feeding dry, unsoaked beet pulp, one being that it is linked to choke. Any dry feed may cause choke, especially if the horse does not have free access to water, or if the horse has other risk factors linked to choking, such as a tendency to bolt its food. However, while horses have choked on beet pulp, university studies have not documented that beet pulp is a particular problem. It is believed that choke related to beet pulp is linked to the particle size and the horse's aggressive feeding behaviour, rather than the actual feed itself. Nonetheless, the risk of choke associated with any dry feed, including beet pulp, can be reduced by soaking the ration prior to feeding. Another concern expressed by horse owners is that dry beet pulp will absorb water and swell in a horse's stomach, causing digestive problems such as impaction or colic. However, a properly hydrated horse usually produces enough saliva to moisten any feedstuff properly, including beet pulp. Thus, while research indicates that soaking beet pulp is not necessary to prevent, there are other reasons for soaking beet pulp. It may make the feed easier to chew, particularly for older horses with bad teeth. Soaking may improve the taste, and may be a way to hide supplements or medications. While horses usually drink enough water on their own, feeding soaked beet pulp can increase fluid intake, particularly in the winter when horses may drink less water than they need.

In 1945, he attended the Gujarat Vidyapith where he earned his LLB with distinctions in 1949. While there, Ebrahim studied courses on philosophy and also attended the lectures given by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, which played an important role in his advocacy for non-violence. In 1950, Ebrahim moved to Pakistan and attended the Sindh Muslim Law College, where he earned an LLM and was awarded an honorary Juris Doctor in 1960. In 1961, Ebrahim established his own firm while he continued to lecture at the Sindh Law College. In 1971, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto appointed him Attorney General of Pakistan. He served as the interim Law Minister from 18 July 1993 until 19 October 1993, and interim Justice Minister from 5 November 1996 until 17 February 1997. Ebrahim was a retired Associate Judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, and Senior Advocate Supreme Court and was known also as a peace activist. In 1988, he was also Governor of Sindh, appointed by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto during her first term.http://www.dinnews.tv/dinnews/national/fg_ebrahim_distressed_at_babar_awan's_allegations-5544.aspx In March 1981, serving as an ad hoc Judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, he refused to take a fresh oath, under the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) promulgated by General Zia-ul-Haq along with Justice Dorab Patel and Chief Justice Sheikh Anwarul Haq. The PCO not only negated the independence of the judiciary but also prolonged martial law by nullifying the effect of a judgement giving General Zia's regime limited recognition. Ebrahim established the Citizen Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) in 1989. The CPLC works in Karachi and assists citizens in registering the First Information Report if it is refused by police for some reason. Ebrahim headed the law firm of Fakhruddin G. Ebrahim & Company, a general legal practice originally established in Bombay (now Mumbai), India. The firm relocated to Karachi in 1951. Ebrahim had long-standing ties with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). In 1995, the PCB initiated an inquiry, under the chairmanship of Ebrahim, to look into allegations made by Australian players Shane Warne and Mark Waugh surrounding the First Test between Pakistan and Australia in Karachi in 1994 and the ODI in Rawalpindi. The Australian cricketers had accused Saleem Malik of offering them bribes which they rejected. The inquiry was frustrated as the Australian players did not travel to Pakistan to give evidence, and thus the Inquiry had to rely on their statements together with the cross-examination of Saleem Malik. In October 1995, it was decided that the allegations were unfounded. In December 2006, Ebrahim also served as the Chairman of the PCB's Anti-doping Appeals Committee, which acquitted Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif. Ebrahim was in favour of the acquittal.

They occupied the area in and around the Virgin River and Muddy Rivers, the western Colorado Plateau, the Moapa Valley and were bordered to the south by the Colorado River. They occupied areas in present-day Nevada, Arizona, and Utah. Their occupation of the area lasted from about 1 CE to around 1200 CE, which according to the Pecos Classification places the occupation from Early Basketmaker II Era to Early Pueblo III periods. Their neighbors were the Fremont culture to the north and the Kayenta Anasazi to the east. Regional Distribution The Virgin Anasazi occupied three regional areas: Plateau The word plateau refers to the Colorado Plateau. This area is diverse in its natural resources and environs. It is characterized by conifer forests at upper elevations, and juniper and pinon pine zones at lower elevations. There are also areas of desert plains where sagebrush is one of the most common plants. This area includes parts of the Grand Canyon and the eastern Great Basin. St. George Basin The St. George Basin is located in and around present day St. George, Utah. The people who occupied this area usually built their sites on the edges of streams ranging in elevation from 800-1300m. Lowland Virgin The Lowland Virgin area encompasses the areas around the Virgin and Muddy Rivers draining into the Moapa Valley. It is located in the Basin and Range Province. The plant life includes creosote bush, mesquite, cholla, as well as other desert shrubs and plants. Lifeways Unlike their eastern counterparts who constructed monumental architecture (as in Chaco Canyon) the Virgin Anasazi lived in small seasonal pueblo groups of only a few rooms. The Virgin Anasazi practiced seasonal subsistence corn agriculture. They often used \\"dry\\" farming techniques, i.e. using ground water and rain as the source for irrigation. Later on, though, populations in proximity to waterways used check-dams and canal irrigation. They also utilized local available wild resources such as pine nuts from the Pinyon pine and hunted game including mule deer, jack rabbits, and rabbits.

They are currently unsigned and recording the pre-preproduction of their third studio album. They have recently released a new EP containing six new tracks. Background=Stigmata (2000‚Äì2002) Blinded Colony was formed in January 2000, by guitarists Johan Blomstrom and Tobias Olsson, and singer Niklas Svensson. At that point the band was known as Stigmata. In June 2000, the band began recording their first demo, Painreceiver, and two new members were recruited, Christoffer Nilsson to play drums, and Annika Hapt√©n, a singer. Later that summer Staffan Franz√©n was officially announced as the bass player. After finishing the recording of Painreceiver, the band performed shows around Sweden, but began to lose faith in the endeavor. Due to lack of interest the band went on hiatus. Six months later drummer Christoffer Nilsson decided to leave the band, and Staffan Franz√©n switched from bass to drums. Shortly after Nilsson's departure, Blomstrom and Olssonsfound a new bass player, Roy Erlandsson. After reforming, Annika Hapt√©n quit the band due to musical differences. In 2002, the band's second demo, Tribute to Chaos, was released. Tribute to Chaos caught the attention of Italy-based Scarlet Records. Coinciding with their new record deal, the band officially changed their name to Blinded Colony. Divine and Scarlet Records Blinded Colony's debut studio album, Divine, was self-produced and released in 2003 through Scarlet Records throughout Europe and was distributed in Japan through Soundholic Records. Blinded Colony and Scarlet Records parted ways a year later. After parting ways with Scarlet Records, Blinded Colony announced the departure of the band's original vocalist, Niklas Svensson, and the addition of new vocalist Johan Schuster. Bedtime Prayers and Pivotal Rockordings The band would then record 2005's Promo Demo and release it in early April 2005. The demo would catch the attention of U.S.-based upstart record label, Pivotal Rockordings. After signing with Pivotal Rockordings, Blinded Colony began recording their second full-length album, Bedtime Prayers, in the spring of 2006. The band chose once again to produce and record the album themselves at their home studio, SoundPalace.Bedtime Prayers, was warmly received by underground metal circles and was compared to the works of other established melodic death metal bands like In Flames and Soilwork. A music video for the song \\"Once Bitten, Twice Shy\\" was made, but the proposed music video for the song \\"Heart\\" was cancelled. Blinded Colony recently completed the 'Outcasts Over Europe' tour in support of Ektomorf and former Scarlet Records label- mates Kayser. They have also shared the stage with notable acts such as former Pivotal Rockording label-mates Sonic Syndicate, and Dark Tranquillity. After touring Blinded Colony would take part in summer festivals for 2007. In late August 2007 it was announced that vocalist Johan Schuster and bassist Roy Erlandsson had been replaced by Denny Axelsson and Johan Olsson. The split was announced as \\"professional differences.\\" After a quiet winter spent with the band writing new material, another replacement was announced, as Tobias Olsson moved from guitar to bass and the band added new guitarist Martin Bergman to fill the slot left by the switch. Although Pivotal Rockordings never released a press release about the departure of the band, they are currently unsigned and are writing new material for their third full-length studio album. It was announced on October 9, 2008 that vocalist Denny Axelsson and the band had parted ways citing \\"professional differences\\" as the reason. In May‚ÄìJune 2010 Blinded Colony announced that they have found a replacement for Johan & Axelsson, there would from now on be two vocalists in Blinded Colony. The new vocalists are Linus and Joel. After releasing new songs, it was announced that Blinded Colony would change its name to The Blinded. This change was due to the idea that the band consisted of completely different members and therefore was not the same blinded colony. Other media The song \\"Once Bitten, Twice Shy\\" is featured in the Xbox 360/PlayStation 3 video game The Darkness. Prior to the release of Bedtime Prayers, the song \\"My Halo\\" was featured on the charity CD Project Suubi for Ugandan orphans.

The pilot had ejected over an hour earlier near Ko≈Çobrzeg, Poland, after experiencing technical problems, but the aircraft continued flying for around before running out of fuel and descending into the ground.  History of the flight  The incident started as a routine training flight. Colonel Nikolai Skuridin, the pilot, was to fly a MiG-23M from the Bagicz Airbase near Ko≈Çobrzeg, Poland. During takeoff, the engine's afterburner failed, causing a partial loss of power. At an altitude of and descending, the pilot elected to abandon the aircraft and ejected safely. However, the engine kept running and the aircraft remained airborne, flying on autopilot in a westerly direction.Incident overview from Eastern Wings The unmanned aircraft left Polish airspace, crossing into East Germany and then West Germany, where it was intercepted by a pair of F-15s from the 32d Tactical Fighter Squadron of the United States Air Forces Europe, stationed at Soesterberg Air Base in the Netherlands. The F-15 pilots reported that the MiG had no crew.Davies, Steve, and Dildy, Doug, \\"F-15 Eagle Engaged ‚Äì The World's Most Successful Jet Fighter\\", Osprey Publishing, Botley, Oxford, UK, 2007, , pages 102‚Äì106.

The escorting F-15s were instructed to shoot down the plane over the North Sea, but as the MiG ran out of fuel, it started a slow turn to the south, prompting the French Air Force to put its fighters on alert. After flying over , the MiG eventually crashed into a house near Kortrijk, less than from the French border, killing an 18-year-old resident.  Political aftermath  The Belgian government made a formal protest to the Soviet Union for the lack of notification about the stray aircraft. The then Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens expressed concern that \\"from the time the MiG-23 was first picked up on NATO radar to the time it crashed more than an hour later, no word of warning came from the Soviet side,\\" and that \\"there was also a 'notable slowness' on the part of the Soviets in disclosing whether the jet was carrying nuclear or toxic weapons.\\"  See also  * Cornfield Bomber  References  External links  * Graphics of the flight (newspaper Lib√©ration, description in French) * CBS News report synopsis from the Vanderbilt Television News Archive (accessible only for associates) Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1989 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents caused by fuel exhaustion Category:Accidents and incidents involving military aircraft Category:1989 in Belgium Category:1989 in the Soviet Union Category:Belgium‚ÄìSoviet Union relations Category:Diplomatic incidents Category:July 1989 events in Europe ","title":"1989 Belgium MiG-23 crash"},{"id":"10090392","text":"Schernfeld is a municipality in the district of Eichst√§tt in Bavaria in Germany.

Born in 1830 in Sliven (known as ƒ∞slimiye at the time), he became a hajduk in Georgi Trankin's band of rebels in 1858. Two years later, after the death of Trankin, Hitov succeeded him as voivode of the band, which became one of the most active in southeastern Bulgaria. Some of his subordinates included Hadzhi Dimitar, Stoyan Papazov and Dyado Zhelyu. Around 1864‚Äì1865, Hitov began to regard his actions as part of the national liberation movement, and was in correspondence with Georgi Rakovski. In 1864, while in Serbia, he gathered band members among the Bulgarians in Kragujevac and Belgrade and moved to the region of Berkovitsa and Pirot. According to Rakovski's plan as presented in \\"1867 Provisional Law on the National and Forest Bands\\", Hitov was to be the chief Bulgarian voivode. Panayot Hitov in 1867 Following Rakovski's death on April 28, 1867, Hitov entered Bulgaria from Romania at Tutrakan with a band of thirty, the band's standard-bearer being Vasil Levski. With his band, Hitov headed to the Balkan Mountains and spent some time around Kotel and Sliven. The goal of his band was not to organize an uprising, but to garner support among the Bulgarians for an organized resistance against Ottoman rule. In August 1867, together with his band and that of Filip Totyu, Hitov headed to Serbia along the ridge of the Balkan Mountains. He settled in Belgrade, living there as a pensioner and becoming a supporter of the idea that Bulgaria's liberation struggle should be co- ordinated with Serbia's anti-Ottoman actions. Between 1869 and 1871, he expressed his views to Vasil Levski, with whom he kept up a correspondence. Without taking Levski's advice into consideration, he signed an agreement with the Montenegrin voivode Matanoviƒá to organize a joint uprising in Bulgaria, Bosnia, Herzegovina and Albania. In April 1872 Hitov became a member of the Bucharest branch of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee (BRCC). After Levski's death in 1873, Hitov played an important role in the Bucharest committee, although he continued to live in Belgrade. In August 1875, he presided over the BRCC assembly which approved the proclamation of the Stara Zagora Uprising. According to the plan, Panayot Hitov was supposed to lead a band of soldiers, but this was not carried out due to the Serbian government's objections. Hitov was a leader in the Serbian-Turkish War of 1876 and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. After the Liberation in 1878, Hitov lived in Rousse, taking part in local political life. In 1885, he headed the Unification of Bulgaria in his native Sliven. Later, due to his opposition to Stefan Stambolov's regime (1887‚Äì1894), he was sent to prison. He died on February 22, 1918 in Rousse. Honours Actions of the rebel detachments of Panayot Hitov and Filip Totyu in 1867.

The park has waterfalls, pools, cinder cones, tree moulds, lava tubes, spatter cones, a lava-dammed lake, caves and other features created by lava flows. The park aims to protect moose, goats, marmots, bears and many other species of wildlife. The park covers 178.93 square kilometres in area. Volcanic eruption It is believed to be the site of Canada's most recent volcanic eruption and lava flow, a geological disaster that killed an estimated 2,000 people. The source of the eruption was the Tseax Cone. Large lava flows dammed the Nass River and destroyed two villages of the Nisga'a people around the year 1700. Lava beds rise as much as 12 metres above the modern road. Nisga'a oral histories record the names of the two villages destroyed in the eruption, Wii Lax K'abit and Lax Ksiluux.

A Party of Alberta organizer was quoted in the media on issues such as Senate reform, the proposed changes to income trust taxation and the recognition of the Qu√©b√©cois as a 'nation'. He stated that the position of the Conservatives on each issue showed a growing distance between the interests of Albertans and that party. At the time, the Conservatives held all 28 seats in Alberta. In January 2008, the Party of Alberta appeared to be inactive and had put its registration campaign on hold. As it was never registered with Elections Canada, no candidates could be run under the party's banner in the 2008 federal election.

Description The square is a vast unidentified semi-circular set, probably from the 2nd or 3rd century. It's located next to the triumphal arch \\"Porte Noire\\". The Saint-Jean-Baptiste church stood on the site of the square until the French Revolution. The church was destroyed between 1794 and 1797. Archaeologist and librarian Auguste Castan launched excavations in 1870. He discovered 8 Corinthian columns, remains of the water distribution pond which collected the water brought by the Roman aqueduct of Arcier, and the remains of a hemicycle that has an inner diameter of 54 meters. What was it? Auguste Castan identified it with the antique theater of Vesontio. The hemicycle may also have constituted a podium which supported the colonnade of an overcast portico: it delimits a raised esplanade whose exact function is unknown at the present time. An English garden An English archaeological garden was created in 1870 to brighten up the remains. It was opened to the public in 1874 and took the name of Auguste Castan in 1898.

The wrappers all match the color of the gum inside (except for the American Prism flavor, which has a lime green wrapper with red-orange gum).

Also, like other similar cameras, the Maxxum 4 has a built-in pop-up flash as well as a shoe for a dedicated flash with TTL flash control. The camera has three autofocus sensors. The centre one is a cross-type sensor.

Its start point is at Jining and ends at Tongliao. The Jitong railway is a joint venture between China Railway and the government of Inner Mongolia. Since Inner Mongolia was one of the poorer provinces of China in the early 1990s, the line was built with an eye towards reducing startup costs, with the intention of upgrading at a future date as funds became available. The tracks were built to a high engineering standard, featuring heavy rail, concrete crossties, and extensive use of tunnels and viaducts to reduce grades. In contrast, lower-cost anachronistic technologies were intentionally selected for cases where it was possible to upgrade incrementally: semaphore signaling, manned crossing gates, and steam engines. World's last mainline steam train service Due to low labor costs and plentiful coal, China was one of the last countries to retire steam locomotives on mainline services. As dieselization and electrification progressed in the early 1990s, China Railways found itself with a large stock of surplus steam locomotives, some built as recently as the late 1980s. The government of Inner Mongolia was thus able to acquire steam engines at a low cost for use on the Jitong railway. The line's proximity to coal mines also allowed fuel to be procured locally, resulting in reduced operating costs. The Jitong railway was the last mainline railway in the world to use steam locomotives. All of these locomotives were the large 2-10-2 QJ type engines and often trains had 2 locomotives on their head end. On December 8, 2005, the world's last regular mainline steam train finished its journey, marking the end of steam era. The steam locomotives were replaced by the DF4 diesel locomotives. The two QJ locomotives with Milwaukee Road 261 behind them on an excursion through Illinois, here passing Atkinson on September 16, 2006. Two QJ steam locomotives, 6988 and 7081, were delivered to United States for use on the Iowa Interstate Railroad. They have run many excursions including one with ex Milwaukee Road 261, a 4-8-4 Northern. This was the first triple headed main line steam train in the USA since the 1991 tripleheader that utilized Southern Railway 4501, Norfolk and Western 611, and Norfolk & Western 1218 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Norfolk Southern steam program, which had started on the Southern Railway (U.S.) in 1966 with the then newly rebuilt 4501 as the only operating locomotive in the program.

History=Early history: 2003‚Äì2004 Caspian loosely formed in Autumn of 2003 in Beverly, Massachusetts, developing material through the first year of its existence, recording a demo in May 2004 and performing a small number of shows in late 2004 and early 2005, including support for the Japanese post-rock band Mono. The band's first performance took place at The Pickled Onion in Beverly, Massachusetts on August 26, 2004. At the time the band had not yet chosen the name Caspian and was looking for a vocalist. You Are The Conductor: 2005‚Äì2006 In January 2005, the band signed with Dopamine Records, releasing a debut EP, You Are the Conductor in November 2005. This was followed, in January 2006, with the band's first tour of the Northeast comprising four dates in New York, D.C. and Pittsburgh. In April and May 2006, the band embarked on its first full tour of the US, reaching to the west coast and back. A hand pressed, limited edition tour EP was released by the band in September 2006 on their second full tour of the United States. The Four Trees: 2007‚Äì2008 Caspian guitarist Philip Jamieson performing in Tilburg, Netherlands Over the course of 2006, the band developed material for a debut album, recording with Ethan Dussault again in August 2006 in Cambridge, Massachusetts at the newly renovated New Alliance Audio. Released on Dopamine Records on April 10, 2007, their debut album, The Four Trees, continued their positive exposure to a growing underground of Post-Rock fans. The album was re-released in Europe by Make My Day Records in July 2008. Later that year, they recorded a split 7\\" with fellow Massachusetts band Constants. Once again Caspian embarked on a three-month-long coast to coast tour of the United States to support the release. After learning that founding member, guitarist Calvin Joss, could no longer fulfill touring duties, Erin Burke- Moran of The Fly-Agaris Sky, was initially recruited to tour in place of Joss, but became a full-time member immediately following their 2007 Spring U.S. Tour. Joss remains an active member of the band and will perform live with the band when scheduling permits. Tertia: 2009‚Äì2011 Now officially a 5 piece band, Caspian released a follow-up to their debut called Tertia in Europe on 7 August 2009 and in the US on 15 September 2009. Caspian once again recorded the album in February 2007 at New Alliance Audio with Ethan Dussault. Caspian performing at Old South Church in Boston, Massachusetts, October 2010 To tour the album upon its release, Caspian enlisted Washington DC area guitarist, Jonny Ashburn, and Austin, TX bassist, Jon McMahan to assist. \\"Tertia\\" was supported by two massive European tours (Fall of 2009 and Spring 2010) and a two-month North American tour (March/April 2010) that included opening for Red Sparowes and Fang Island. In July 2010 the band played their first ever shows in China. The two-date \\"Asian Tour\\" was July 16 at the Hidden Agenda Live House and the second was on July 17 in Guangzhou, as part of the Qiangyuan Music Festival. The band toured the U.S. in September and October with their October 22 show at the Old South Church in Boston. The show was recorded, and highlights were released on an EP titled Live at the Old South Church in January 2012. The tour continued to Europe in November and December playing support with God is an Astronaut.In 2010 alone the band performed close to 150 concerts in 33 countries on 3 continents. The band played their final concert of 2010 at the Middle East Downstairs in Cambridge as part of the \\"Last Night on Earth\\", the eighth of the series, with Constants, Irepress and Moving Mountains. Waking Season: 2011‚Äì2014 In a band blog update in early January 2011 the band said that most of their time over the next year would be spent writing and recording their 3rd full-length album. They performed at the 2011 SXSW Music Festival in Austin, Texas and played an 8-day European tour in April 2011 visiting Russia, Germany, Poland, and the Netherlands including a headline performance at the Dunk! Festival in Zottegem, Belgium. During the summer of 2011, Caspian refrained from live performances and focused exclusively on writing new material. The band enlisted the services of Matt Bayles to co-produce, engineer, and mix the record, which was recorded at Q Division Studios in Somerville, MA in January 2012 for 3 weeks. Additional recording and production occurred in February 2012 at Radar Studios in Clinton, CT. The album was mixed at Red Room Studios in Seattle by Matt Bayles with the band for 10 days in May, 2012. On July 9, 2012 the band announced that the album title would be Waking Season. The release date was later confirmed to be September 21, 2012, sold via Triple Crown Records. A week before the album's U.S. release Spin.com posted a full stream of the album and called it \\"The Post Rock Album of the Year\\". The band played a few shows before starting a 16-show-run in support of Minus the Bear and Cursive. Upon completion of that string of dates, Caspian headed to Europe touring from October 10, through November 20, and completed a full U.S. headline tour in February and March 2013 with support from Junius and Native. On May 26 the band opened up day two of the first Boston Calling Music Festival at the Boston City Hall Plaza. The band played a short and spirited set and it also marked the first time the band played with six members on stage. The band followed up the outdoor show with a free concert in Beverly on July 13. On August 28, 2013, the band announced via Facebook that bassist Chris Friedrich had died. He was 32 years old. For much of the month of October 2013 the band supported HIM on a European tour. They subsequently returned to the U.S. for a string of dates with 65daysofstatic as co-headliners. During this tour the band announced the release of a new EP, entitled Hymn For The Greatest Generation, containing three new songs, as well as a demo and two remixes of songs from Waking Season. Pitchfork began to stream the title track on October 9, 2013, prior to the EP's release on November 11, 2013. \\"Hymn For The Greatest Generation\\" was the final recording on which bassist Chris Friedrich appeared, though it was released after his death. The album Waking Season was later given an Australia and New Zealand release through Hobbledehoy Record Co. in January 2014. In March 2014 the band did two shows before departing for a tour of Asia and Australia. The 14-show-tour had the band playing shows in the Philippines, Singapore, six shows in China, Taiwan, and a five shows in Australia. Dust and Disquiet: 2015‚Äì2017 Caspian performing at The Tabernacle in Atlanta, Georgia, on April 23, 2016 In June 2015, Caspian released a 10th anniversary concert film, Live From the Larcom, recorded at the historic Larcom Theatre in their hometown of Beverly, Massachusetts in October 2014. The release was followed by a free screening of the film at the Cabot Theater. The band began work on their fourth LP in March and April, and began hosting \\"listening parties\\" where paying fans were given iPods loaded with tracks from the album and invited to listen and discuss the record. The band also hosted additional parties in Europe in April and May 2015. On June 26, Noisey premiered the first single, \\"Sad Heart of Mine\\", off the upcoming record, titled Dust & Disquiet. On September 13, 2015 the band appeared on \\"Boston Emissions\\", a radio program airing on WZLX. All six members were in studio for the interview and a number of the new songs were played from the forthcoming record. Dust & Disquiet was released worldwide on September 25, 2015. Along with the single, the band announced U.S. and Canada tour dates for the fall, 2015. The album was the first from the band to include vocals. By the end of the first four months of 2016 the band had played over 50 shows. In February the band did a U.S. tour with Defeater, after which they headed to Asia, where they performed a dozen total shows in China, Taiwan and the band's first-ever shows in Japan. Once back in the U.S. the band headed out on tour in support of Underoath. The tour opened in Houston on March 21 and concluded in Orlando Florida on April 24, with 29 total shows played. After much of the summer was taken for personal time the band headed back to Europe in mid August and played a series of headlining dates and appeared at 5 different festivals. On October 20 the band released a short film that was accompanied by a new song \\"Castles High, Marble Bright\\". The track made its first live appearance almost two years to the day prior. The band, when doing their 10th Anniversary show at the Larcom Theater, closed the show with this track, which some fans took to calling \\"Joy\\". Alongside the video the band announced its plan to release the track via \\"8 Inch\\" and it would be sold on their tour as well as available online both digitally and in physical form. On October 22 the band hit the road in North America once more. The 22 date tour started in Washington DC at the Rock and Roll Hotel and ended on November 19 a Bar Le Ritz, in Montreal, Canada. All shows featured The Appleseed Cast. On the November 1, 2016 stop of the tour the band was recorded performing live at the Teragram Ballroom in Los Angeles to be later featured on Last Call with Carson Daly. The segment aired on November 15 in the U.S. and it featured \\"Sad Heart of Mine\\" as well as a shortened version of \\"Arcs of Command\\" in the latter part of the program. This was the band's first appearance on late night television. The band appeared for a second time on the show in February 2017. Recorded at the same venue the second airing of the show had an abridged performance of \\"Castles High, Marble Bright\\". On 18, February 2017 the band played their first show in Mexico. The band was part of the \\"Forever Alone Festival\\" that took place at Foro Indie Rocks in Mexico City. Other bands on the bill included This Will Destroy You Ttng, The Polar Dream, Mylets and many more. The band was then slated to support Katatonia on their 28-city-tour. The tour opened in Washington D.C. on March 16, and concluded on April 22 when both bands appeared at the New England Metal and Hardcore Festival in Worcester MA. No sooner did the band complete the tour with Katatonia when they played two additional shows in China. April 29 the band played the Strawberry Festival in Shanghai and then Beijing for a headline show at Modernsky Lab on May 1. Touring and On Circles: 2018-present In March 2018, via social media, the band posted a shot of them in the studio. There was no indication given as to the potential release of any of the material. The band headed to Europe for a brief tour that included a performance at DunkFest in Zottegem. The band then played two shows at Saint Vitus in New York City as part of the Northside Festival. At the time it was slated to be the only U.S. shows for 2018 so the band celebrated by performing Dust and Disquiet in full on the June 8, their second night. The band supported Minus the Bear from 9 October to 28 October 2018, for a total of 18 shows. In May 2019, the band announced they were headed to the studio to record their next record. In a social media post the band indicated they would be in studio for the month. The initial recording was completed in late-May 2019. On June 11, 2019, the band formally announced that a longtime friend and collaborator, Justin Forrest, was the new drummer for the band. Forrest had been touring with the band since 2018 and was also the drummer while the band was in the studio over the prior month. In the same post the band also acknowledged that the split with former drummer Joe Vickers was amicable. On November 16, 2019, the band performed two shows (matinee and evening) show with the Losander Chamber Orchestra. The event was held at the Cabot Theater in Beverly Massachusetts. The orchestra was made up of string, brass and woodwind instruments and they accompanied the band on many of the songs. The event featured never before heard songs as well as Caspian classics. Burke-Moran was responsible for much of the sheet music used by the Orchestra and would even put his guitar down on a few occasions during the event to \\"conduct\\". On Circles was released January 24, 2020. On March 25, 2020, many of the band members were involved with a Q+A on Reddit and handled well over 250 unique questions. With touring plans on hold and self quarantine due to Covid-19 many of the band members took to social media for chats and online lessons with fan interaction. Phil Jamieson explained \\"Circles on Circles\\" a few days later Calvin Joss worked through (Hymn for) The Greatest Generation, Jonny Ashburn did Rioseco and finally Erin Burke Moran worked Arcs of Command Pairing up with Audiotree, who had filmed the Cabot Theater show, the band did a 24 hour \\"ticketed\\" stream of the show on 30 September 2020. Fans that bought \\"virtual tickets\\" were provided a code and a 24 hour window to watch the show as often as they'd like. Prior to the first airing (and during) Jamieson, Ashburn and Zubkov were all part of the live chat with fans. The band wanted the event to \\"Feel like an actual concert\\" have said there is no plan to release the show other than this one off event. The following day Jamieson and Burke-Moran did an Instragram Live session to further engage fans.

History Peano first published the theorem in 1886 with an incorrect proof. In 1890 he published a new correct proof using successive approximations. Theorem Let D be an open subset of R √ó R with :f\\\\colon D \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} a continuous function and :y'(x) = f\\\\left(x,y(x)\\\\right) a continuous, explicit first-order differential equation defined on D, then every initial value problem :y\\\\left(x_0\\\\right) = y_0 for f with (x_0, y_0) \\\\in D has a local solution :z\\\\colon I \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} where I is a neighbourhood of x_0 in \\\\mathbb{R}, such that z'(x) = f\\\\left(x,z(x)\\\\right) for all x \\\\in I . The solution need not be unique: one and the same initial value (x0,y0) may give rise to many different solutions z. Related theorems The Peano theorem can be compared with another existence result in the same context, the Picard‚ÄìLindel√∂f theorem. The Picard‚ÄìLindel√∂f theorem both assumes more and concludes more. It requires Lipschitz continuity, while the Peano theorem requires only continuity; but it proves both existence and uniqueness where the Peano theorem proves only the existence of solutions. To illustrate, consider the ordinary differential equation :y' = \\\\left\\\\vert y\\\\right\\\\vert^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} on the domain \\\\left[0, 1\\\\right]. According to the Peano theorem, this equation has solutions, but the Picard‚ÄìLindel√∂f theorem does not apply since the right hand side is not Lipschitz continuous in any neighbourhood containing 0. Thus we can conclude existence but not uniqueness. It turns out that this ordinary differential equation has two kinds of solutions when starting at y(0)=0, either y(x)=0 or y(x)=x^2/4. The transition between y=0 and y=(x-C)^2/4 can happen at any C. The Carath√©odory existence theorem is a generalization of the Peano existence theorem with weaker conditions than continuity.

Mather became involved with the National Parks, he invited the Office of Public Roads Engineer T. Warren Allen to speak at the 1915 Berkeley National Parks Conference. Mather had concerns over letting the Office of Public Roads develop highway systems within the National Parks. While Allen's approach to public roads saw no difference between National Forests and National Parks, his involvement was an early indication of the public interest in driving. It was the following year that Mather joined the campaign for the Park to Park Highway. The National Park-to-Park Highway Association was formed in 1916 and began promoting roads and roadway improvements in the Northwest and Rocky Mountain states. Other Highway Associations had been supporting a variety of routes linking the scenic wonders of the western National Parks. In 1915, a Denver group of motorists took off on a journey from Rocky Mountain National Park to Yellowstone. The Wonderland Trail Association was already promoting the next segment of the journey from Yellowstone to Glacier and then westward to Mount Rainier. In 1917, the Parks Highway Association began marking the route from Glacier to Mount Rainier and added a southern segment to Crater Lake. By 1919, there were annual meetings of the National Park to Park supporters. That same year, Charles Goodwin was assigned as Superintendent at Glacier. Here, he began to work on developing potential routes through the park. When Mather's preference for an east-west link across the park was made known, he began looking for a route to link the two sides that would complement the Park-to-Park Highway. This route would become the Going-to-the-Sun Road. By 1920, eleven states were involved in the Park-to-Park Highway program. The proposed route would cover of roads and numerous feeders to and from the various National Parks.Park-to- Park Plans to Enter Eleven States; The Highway Magazine, Volumes 9-12 By Armco Drainage Products Association, Armco Drainage & Metal Products, Inc; pg 11, 1920 NotesExternal links * Map of the National Park-to-Park Highway from 1924 * National Parks Traveler: The National Park to Park Highway Category:Auto trails in the United States Category:National parks of the United States Category:1916 establishments in the United States ","title":"National Park to Park Highway"},{"id":"10090605","text":"Conchita Montenegro (San Sebasti√°n, Spain, September 11, 1911 ‚Äì Madrid, April 22, 2007) was a Spanish model, dancer, stage and screen actress. She was educated in a convent in Madrid. Multitalented Montenegro first worked professionally as a model for the famous painter Ignacio Zuloaga y Zabaleta. During her childhood, she learned classical and Spanish dance. She was credited with revolutionizing the presentation of Spanish dances. Montenegro turned from dancing to dramatic acting and starred in numerous productions. She attained theatrical fame in Hollywood, France, and Germany by the time she was 13 years old. At the age of 16, she starred in the French film La Femme et le pantin (1928), directed by Jacques de Baroncelli. Screen success Montenegro came to Hollywood in June 1930 with a contract at Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer.\\"M-G-M Signs Spanish Star,\\" Los Angeles Times January 9, 1931, Page A9.

Never the Twain Shall MeetThe AFI Catalog of Feature Films:..Never the Twain Shall Meet is the English language version of a story written by Peter B. Kyne and was directed by W.S. Van Dyke. Before this performance, Montenegro had been cast in special Spanish-language versions of MGM movies, such as Call of the Flesh and Love in Every Port (both 1930).\\"Spanish Actress to Play in Film,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 12, 1930, Page A1. The former starred Ramon Novarro, and the latter featured Jos√© Crespo. Montenegro's next screen project was Strangers May Kiss (1931) starring Norma Shearer and Robert Montgomery, with Montenegro in the ingenue role as \\"Spanish Dancer.\\" By mid-1931, Montenegro had left MGM and signed with Fox Film Corporation. Train wreck In August 1931, Montenegro was aboard the Southern Pacific Argonaut (passenger train) when the train derailed near Yuma, Arizona, two trainmen were killed in the crash.\\"Two Killed In Wreck Of Train From Los Angeles\\", Los Angeles Times, August 6, 1931, Page 1.

Forty others among the film company also riding in that section were spared injury when the second section missed hitting the first. The steam engine, two cars of the baggage car section, and a day coach overturned after the train struck a roadbed which had been softened by rain. The Argonaut was en route to a location shoot for The Cisco Kid (1931), in Tucson.

Fox starlet In 1931, Fox Films selected three of its own stars in opposition to the thirteen actresses chosen as WAMPAS Baby Stars, sponsored by the Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers. The three were Montenegro, Helen Mack, and Linda Watkins. Eleven Fox publicity men resigned in protest of the WAMPAS Baby Stars decision to eschew naming any Fox starlets among its list of actresses most likely to achieve success. In addition Fox promised to name budding stars, or \\"Fox debutante stars\\", annually. Montenegro was sometimes featured in stage shows which coincided with the screening of film premieres. One such instance was the premiere of A Passport To Hell, starring Elissa Landi. The movie debuted at the Loew's Kings Theater in August 1932. Montenegro provided the vaudeville entertainment beforehand. On another occasion, she teamed with Teddy Joyce in the stage show for the opening of The Kennel Murder Case (1933). The film screened at the Warner Brothers Hollywood Theater. Together with Will Rogers, Montenegro performed an Adagio for Strings number prior to the premiere of Handy Andy (1934).Los Angeles Times, \\"They're Adagio Dancers\\", July 24, 1934, Page 11. Montenegro's movie career in America continued until 1940. That year she performed the leading female part in Eternal Melodies (Melodie eterne), an Italian production. The story focused on the unrequited first love of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played by Gino Cervi. Playing Aloisa Weber, Montenegro jilts the composer in this Italian language production.

The film dealt with the customs of primitive peoples in South America. Another of Roulien's films, El grito de la juventud, which debuted in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 24 September 1939, was much better known. A short time later Montenegro and Roulien were divorced. In 1944, Montenegro married the Spanish diplomat Ricardo Gim√©nez Arnau, a senior member of the far right Falangist Party and Ambassador to the Holy See.

Montenegro claimed that she used her husband's influence to secure a meeting between the British actor and the caudillo while Howard was in Spain on a lecture tour to promote film in May, 1943, shortly before Howard lost his life when the civilian plane of which he was a passenger on a return flight to England was shot down by German Luftwaffe crashing into the Bay of Biscay.

The convent was closed by the Bolsheviks in 1918 and did not reopen until 1995. History Later sources claim that the convent occupies the site of the original Alekseyevsky (Alexis) Convent, the oldest nunnery in Moscow. It is believed to have been founded by Alexius, Metropolitan of Moscow in 1360 and was consecrated to the Feast of the Conception of Saint Anne. Notable nuns included Alexis's own sisters Eupraxia and Juliana, both canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church in 2000. After the great fire of 1547, the convent was relocated eastward to the present-day site of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. In 1584, a new convent was established on the old site by Feodor I of Russia and his wife, Irina Godunova. The couple, being childless, asked the nuns of the Conception Convent to pray for the conception of their own child. (Another version asserts that the new convent was restored on the old site by the surviving nuns of the Alexeyevsky Convent immediately after the 1547 fire.) It was looted and sustained much damage during the Time of Troubles. The Naryshkin Baroque barbican church of 1696 The extant church over the main gate was built in 1696 with funds provided by the Rimsky-Korsakov noble family. This Naryshkin Baroque church and walls are the only remains of the convent as it existed before the Russian Revolution of 1917. The katholikon was built in 1804-1807 in the Russian Gothic style to Rodion Kazakov's designs. It was pulled down in the 1920s. In the Soviet period, the convent buildings were used as a prison for juvenile delinquents. A school building was constructed on the site of the katholikon. A venerated icon of the Theotokos the Merciful was transferred to the nearby parish Church of St. Elijah. Reconstruction Efforts to revive the convent began in 1991. It was officially reestablished in May 1995. By 2005, the church of St. Anne (third from right on the 1882 photograph) was completed. The Russian Orthodox Church declared the Gothic-influenced style of the old katholikon improper for a Russian Orthodox temple and demanded it to be rebuilt in a more traditional Byzantine style.Russian: \\"–û—Ç —Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞–≤—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –∫ –ø–æ–∏—Å–∫—É –Ω–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ —Å—Ç–∏–ª—è\\", –ù–µ–∑–∞–≤–∏—Å–∏–º–∞—è –ì–∞–∑–µ—Ç–∞, 05.04.2006 In October 2006, Yuri Luzhkov approved a Russian Revival design by Alexander Obolensky on condition that the building's height would be decreased.Russian: www.archi.ru The enormous modern katholikon As of June, 2009, the new five-domed katholikon, made of in situ concrete, was structurally complete.

Rodney Balinski was also a part of the company, as Tom Hantges' and Joe Milanowski's assistant. Operations 'USA Capital', the hard money lender USA Commercial Mortgage Co.(USACM), was a Las Vegas, Nevada based mortgage broker owned by Tom Hantges and Joe Milanowski. Affiliated with the lending/brokerage activity at USACM was a management company, USA Securities, and two funds, the First Trust Deed Fund and for Nevada residents only, the Diversified Trust Deed Fund. There were two general categories of investors; *fund investors who pooled their cash with others and allowed USACM to select which investments would be made and *direct lenders who desired to evaluate projects for themselves before investing in an individual loan. Though there were instances of a single direct lender funding an entire loan, the vast majority of loans were funded by many entities, which included the two Trust Deed Funds themselves. Typically loans ranging from up to $3,000,000 to $30,000,000 would be funded by between 30 and 300 persons, each of whom was a fractional beneficiary of the promissory note. The loans brokered by USACM offered investors high interest rates relative to the prevailing safe rates available on CDs and Treasury Notes. Publicly at least, USACM maintained a nearly unblemished record of stability and integrity for years and advertised that \\"no investor has ever lost a penny of principal.\\" When borrowers approached USACM in need of money, USACM would negotiate hard terms. This included hefty upfront origination fees and loan points, ongoing servicing and extension fees, and back end equity participation or success fees all of which were payable to USACM. The retail investors received interest only. Very often loans were made on land or projects that were very early in their development, entitlement or marketing stages. In most cases, these properties did not generate rental income so sales of units, or the refinance or sale of further entitled land was required to pay the investors back. Impound accounts sufficient to pay interest for the term of the loans were generally funded with the investor's own money and as a result repayment of most loans was almost entirely dependent on continuing high demand for condominium conversions and stable or accelerating demand for builder ready land. Bankruptcy In 2005 with impound funds depleting and the reduced ability of borrowers to sell condos to the public or sell land to builders, borrowers began to default on their obligations. USACM hid this fact from both the Nevada regulators and the investors. In a bid to stay solvent USACM not only continued to collect fees by originating speculative loans into a weakening real estate market but told investors that loans had been extended when in fact the loans had paid off. The proceeds of the payoffs, instead of being paid to the rightful beneficiaries, were diverted to pay thousands of other investors their monthly interest checks. As such every loan in the portfolio appeared to be performing. On April 13, 2006 the company declared bankruptcy. At the time of insolvency the company had 6,500 investors and was managing $962,000,000 in investor assets, making it the biggest bankruptcy case in the history of Nevada. Court cases Marc Levinson, an attorney representing investors in USA Capital likened the operation to a Ponzi scheme. The bankruptcy court judge Linda Riegle ordered the appointment of a trustee to oversee matters when it was disclosed that Hantges and Milanowski owed $9.8 million to a reputed former associate of Gambino crime family boss John Gotti. In November 2006 some investors organized themselves as the USA Capital Lender Protection Group. By March 2007 membership had grown to over 750. On March 15, 2007 New York City private equity firm Compass Partners announced they were the highest bidder at a bankruptcy court auction. The company paid $47 million for the right to service most of the outstanding loans, and for the assets of the USA Capital First Trust Deed Fund. Many investors were opposed to the involvement of Compass. The same month, investors received letters from the FBI informing them that they were possible victims of a crime and that USACM was under investigation. According to an investment prospectus distributed to the Diversified Fund investors all invested funds would be secured by real estate. This was not the case as at least one sizeable unsecured loan was made to an entity owned and controlled by one or more of the principals at USACM. As a result, Joseph Milanowski accepted a plea bargain and was sentenced to 12 years in prison on one count of wire fraud. USA Capital's management was also found to be directly involved with several of the developers that were being funded, a conflict of interest and the Nevada Mortgage Lending Division later issued an opinion stating that the profit participations USACM negotiated on its own behalf while originating the loans were contrary to Nevada law. On June 7, 2007, Michael Carmel, a Chapter 11 Trustee was appointed in the Thomas Hantges Bankruptcy Estate. The Trustee retained Brian Shapiro, Esq of the Law Office of Brian D. Shapiro, LLC as his local Las Vegas Bankruptcy counsel and Robbin Itkin, Esq. of the Law Office of Steptoe and Johnson as his general counsel. They are currently investigating the assets and transactions of Thomas Hantges.

It stars Buster Crabbe (who had previously played the title character in two Flash Gordon serials and would return for a third in 1940) as the eponymous hero, Constance Moore, Jackie Moran and Anthony Warde. It was based on the Buck Rogers character created by Philip Francis Nowlan, which had appeared in magazines and comic strips since 1928. Plot In 1938, Lieutenant Buck Rogers (Buster Crabbe) and Buddy Wade (Jackie Moran) are part of the crew of a dirigible flying over the North Pole. They are caught in a savage storm and crash. They are ordered to release the experimental Nirvano Gas, which (unbeknownst to them) will put them in suspended animation until they are rescued. The Nirvano Gas works, but the dirigible is buried in an avalanche and is not found until 500 years have passed. When Buck and Buddy are found, they awaken in the year 2440 to a world ruled by the ruthless dictator, Killer Kane (Anthony Warde), and his army of \\"super-racketeers\\". Only those who live in the \\"Hidden City\\", run by the benevolent scientist Dr. Huer (C. Montague Shaw) and his military counterpart, Air Marshal Kragg (William Gould), resist the criminal rulers of Earth. Buck and Buddy join the resistance. They volunteer to go to Saturn, where they hope that they can find help in their fight against Kane. Wilma Deering (Constance Moore) is assigned to accompany them. Saturn is run by Aldar (Guy Usher) and the Council of the Wise and Prince Tallen. To the dismay of Buck and Buddy, they also discover that Kane has dispatched ambassadors of his own, headed by his loyal henchman, Captain Laska (Henry Brandon). The serial then becomes a back-and-forth struggle between Buck and Kane to secure the military support of Saturn. Production notes This 12-part Buck Rogers movie serial was launched in 1939. It starred Buster Crabbe, who had played the role of Flash Gordon in the serials Flash Gordon and Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars prior to Buck Rogers. Constance Moore played Lieutenant Wilma Deering, the only woman in the film, and Jackie Moran was Buddy Wade, a character who did not appear in other versions of the Buck Rogers franchise, but who was clearly modeled on the Sunday strip character Buddy Deering. Anthony Warde played \\"Killer Kane\\", Buck Rogers' enemy; this was the only time that Warde, who usually portrayed evil underlings in serials, played a lead villain. Korean-American actor Philson Ahn, younger brother of noted actor Philip Ahn, played Prince Tallen, a Saturnian native who befriends Buck Rogers. The noted actor and \\"crown prince of stuntmen\\" David Sharpe, who appeared in over 4,500 films over the course of a seven-decade career, also appeared in the Buck Rogers serial in several roles: as one of Kane's pilots, a Hidden City sentry, and a Saturnian lieutenant. The serial had a small budget and saved money on special effects by re-using material from other stories: background shots from the futuristic musical Just Imagine (1930), as the city of the future, the garishly stenciled walls from the Azura palace set in Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars, and even the studded leather belt that Crabbe wore in Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars, turned up as part of Buck's uniform. Feature versions of the serial In 1953, the 1939 movie serial was edited into a feature film entitled Planet Outlaws, by Sherman Krellberg for release via Goodwill Pictures Inc.. Then it was edited again to feature length and titled Destination Saturn for syndication to television, in 1965. Finally, the serial was edited once again into a feature film format in the late 1970s, this version simply entitled Buck Rogers with the theatrical poster advertising, \\"Star Wars owes it all to Buck Rogers\\", and which was later sold on videotape in the early 1990s by VCI Entertainment under the catalogue title of Planet Outlaws (which title, to make it appear legitimate, was also superimposed onto the first shot of film following the main titles). The original \\"Planet Outlaws\\" and also \\"Destination Saturn\\" have both been available in video format since the early 1980s, and as early as 1970 were both available for user-purchase in 16mm film format from Thunderbird Pictures. VCI released all twelve installments on DVD in September 2000. In November 2009, VCI released a special 70th anniversary edition on DVD, with extras including \\"The History of Buck Rogers\\" by Clifford \\"Laughing Gravy\\" Weimer, a photo gallery and the 1935 Buck Rogers short feature originally shown at the 1933-34 World's Fair.

An international co-production between the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, the film was directed by Andrew Bergman from a screenplay by Paul Rudnick based on a 1995 New Yorker profile by Michael Korda. The film covers Susann's entire life, focusing on her early struggles as an aspiring actress relentlessly hungry for fame, her relationship with press agent husband Irving Mansfield (Nathan Lane), with whom she had an institutionalized autistic son, her success as the author of Valley of the Dolls, and her battle with and subsequent death from breast cancer.

The film is Malden's only directing credit; in his autobiography, Malden stated that he \\"preferred being a good actor to being a fairly good director.\\" Richard Widmark co-produced the film and stars alongside Richard Basehart, who was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actor for his performance. Plot Army Colonel William Edwards (Richard Widmark) is investigating the case of Major Harry Cargill (Richard Basehart), accused of collaborating with the enemy while he and his unit were held captive in a North Korean prisoner of war camp. Cargill willingly admits his guilt and brings forth evidence that proves that he signed a germ-warfare confession and broadcast anti-American speeches over the radio, seemingly an act of treason. It seems to be an open- and-shut case, were it not for Cargill's inexplicable refusal to defend himself. Arousing further suspicion is the fact that his collaboration immediately followed the deaths of two of his soldiers, and the unit's survivors all recite an identical, rehearsed account of those deaths. Edwards' commander, General Connors (Carl Benton Reid), has a strong personal interest‚Äîhis son, Captain Joe Connors (Yale Wexler), was one of those who died‚Äîand presses Edwards to recommend a court-martial, but Edwards delves into the mystery, refusing to accept the facile explanations. In the end, the shocking truth comes out. Lieutenant George Miller (Rip Torn) reveals that, after Lieutenant Harvey (Manning Ross) was killed trying to escape, the rest of the men discovered that, under torture, Captain Connors had betrayed him. Over Cargill's strong objections, they decided to execute Connors. Drawing the short straw, Miller strangled him. Subsequently, their captor, Colonel Kim (Khigh Dhiegh), gave Cargill an ultimatum: give in, or all his men would be executed. He agreed to collaborate to save their lives. General Connors calls his son a traitor. Cargill argues with him, stating that there must be a time limit on being a hero. He denounces the Uniform Code of Military Justice espoused by General Connors for demanding too much from soldiers, but the general reminds him that, while Cargill anguished over the lives and families of 16 men, many commanders had to anguish over the effect of their orders on the lives and families of thousands. Edwards agrees with General Connors that although Cargill acted out of a humane selflessness, Cargill's judgment was flawed. He recommends that all charges be dropped, but warns Cargill that there will be a court-martial. Edwards himself will defend Cargill.

Widmark reportedly paid $100,000 to The Theatre Guild for the film rights to the play Time Limit. It was the first picture for Widmark's independent production company, Heath Productions, Inc. It was also his idea to have his friend and colleague, Karl Malden, direct it. In a 1988 interview about the film, Malden said, \\"Widmark thought I'd be good directing it, and I said 'Sure, I'd take a crack at it.' I liked what it had to say.\\" Critics gave Malden good reviews for his first directorial effort. (It turned out to be his only directing credit, with the exception of some scenes he filmed for Delmer Daves in The Hanging Tree, released in 1959.) One reviewer praised the movie for its \\"taut direction and vigorous performances drawn not only from principals, but a supporting cast of promising new-comers.\\" The outdoor scenes on an Army post were shot on location at Fort Jay, then an active Army post located on Governors Island, New York in early May 1957. The opening scene in the film shows Colonel Edwards walking through the island, and passing through Liggett Hall. Additional scenes - the Korean prison scenes - were also shot at the Conejo Ranch near Agoura, California.

A leading industrialist from the Eastern Region of Nigeria, he played a pioneering role in large scale manufacturing in the region. He was sometimes called by his alias, Ugobuzuo. He was a friend to various Igbo politicians such as K. O. Mbadiwe and the former Nigerian Vice President, Alex Ekwueme. His relationship with the vice president may have led to his detention under the administration of General Buhari. Life Mathias Ugochukwu was born in Nsogwu, Umunze in the present Orumba South L.G.A of Anambra state. He attended St Augustine's Primary School, Umunze. After completing his primary education, he left for Jos to work as a residential caretaker for Rufus \\"Ofor Jos\\" Ofor, an Igbo businessman from Enugwu-ukwu, Anambra State. However, hoping for more opportunity, he left Jos and joined the police force in present-day Anambra State. Before joining the force, he was involved in minor trading. As an officer, he entered and won 50,000 pounds in the Irish Sweepstake. After collecting the sum, he found private enterprise more fulfilling and productive; he entered business full-time. As a businessman, he founded many firms, forming a strong conglomerate. He established a transport company, and formed a business venture with John Holt, later becoming the chairman of John Holt Inc. He also invested heavily in spare parts, textile importation and real estate development. As a leading Igbo businessman, he was the chairman of the board of directors of the African Development Corporation, the board also had C.T Onyekwelu and Louis Ojukwu as members. The company was part of a project to encourage African entrepreneurship and was supported by N.C.N.C. In 1964, he was appointed chairman of the Nigerian Industrial Development Bank, becoming its first chairman. During the 1970s, he bought various subsidiaries of John Holt as part of an Indigenization decree; he was one of the few Igbo businessmen with enough capital to acquire shares in the multi-national firms of Nigeria.

He wrote it with bandmate Robert Chaisson, but when released, Stan Lewis, the owner of Jewel/Paula Records and whose daughter Susan was the inspiration for the song, and Eleanor Broadwater, the wife of Nashville DJ Gene Nobles, were credited as co-writers to give them shares of the royalties.  Original version  Hawkins cut \\"Susie Q\\" at the KWKH Radio station in Shreveport, Louisiana. \\"Susie Q\\" was a late rockabilly song which captured the spirit of Louisiana and featured guitar work by James Burton, who also worked with Ricky Nelson and later with Elvis Presley, among others. There is some dispute as to whether the Hawkins' rendition of the song was a remake of a 1939 release of a song of the same title, \\"Susie-Q\\", by Sonny Boy Williamson.Rockpalast: Blues Rock Legends Vol. 3 at Discogs. Retrieved December 7, 2014. Sometime after the recording, the master tape of \\"Susie Q\\" was sold to Checker Records in Chicago, which released it as a 45 RPM single in May 1957. The single peaked at numbers 7 and 27 on Billboard magazine's Hot R&B; Sides and Hot 100 charts, respectively. Hawkins' original version is also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \\"500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll\\" and in Robert Christgau's \\"Basic Record Library\\" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). Cover versions=The Rolling Stones There is a short cover of \\"Susie Q\\" by The Rolling Stones on their US album 12 x 5, which was released in 1964. It also appears on the UK album The Rolling Stones No. 2 released in January 1965. Johnny Rivers Johnny Rivers featured a four- minute version of \\"Suzie Q\\" on his live 1965 album Meanwhile Back at the Whisky √† Go Go. Bobby Vee Bobby Vee included a version of \\"Susie Q\\" on his 1961 Liberty album With Strings and Things. Creedence Clearwater Revival Creedence Clearwater Revival released a version on their debut album released in 1968. The band's only Top 40 hit not written by John Fogerty, it peaked at number 11, but made the top ten on others. This song was one of their first big hits. The album version clocks in at 8:37. The single is split into parts one and two on its A and B sides, respectively. The jam session during the coda is omitted in part one. Instead, it fades out with the guitar solo right before the coda, which fades in with part two on the B-side. Fogerty plays the main riff from \\"Smokestack Lightning\\" after the second verse. Fogerty told Rolling Stone magazine in 1993 that he recorded \\"Suzie Q\\" to get the song played on KMPX, a funky progressive-rock radio station in San Francisco, which is why it was extended to eight minutes. The CCR version of the song was first certified Gold by the RIAA on December 13, 1990 for half a million copies shipped, and Platinum on May 10, 2019 for a million copies in sales and streams. Jos√© Feliciano In 1970, Puerto Rican musician Jos√© Feliciano released his version of \\"Susie Q\\" as a single which reached number 84 on the Billboard Hot 100.

This song is a parody of Trapped in the Closet by R. Kelly. To date, the song is Yankovic's longest parody, and his second longest song ever released on his studio albums (with the longest being \\"Albuquerque\\"). The song contains an interpolation of \\"Black Dog\\" by Led Zeppelin at 6:24, when the main character turns on the radio. The interpolation was recorded by Yankovic's band. Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page is a noted fan of Yankovic's work, but had previously denied permission for Yankovic to perform a Led Zeppelin polka medley on an album. The song was listed by Rolling Stone as number seventy-seven in their Best Songs of 2006. Origin and writing Yankovic felt compelled to write this parody because he felt the original was \\"brilliant and wonderful and ridiculous all at the same time\\". Yankovic would normally have considered taking the original song and making lyrics that were \\"more bizarre than they already are\\", but the original R. Kelly song was already bizarre to start with, according to Yankovic. Instead, to contrast the original, \\"Trapped in the Drive-Thru\\" uses the very dramatic structure of the original to tell an extremely banal tale of a couple's attempts to pick up their dinner one night, one of the most \\"banal and mundane\\" stories Yankovic could think of. Much like how the original was divided into various chapters (as of now 33) Yankovic's is also divided, into 3 chapters, although they are not divided on the album itself. Yankovic had received R. Kelly's permission to parody the song, but due to its length, he was worried that he would have to pay 2-3 times the normal statutory rate for inclusion on the album, which would have potentially forced him to remove one or two songs from Straight Outta Lynwood. However, R. Kelly allowed Yankovic to use the full song at the rate of a single song, allowing Yankovic to keep his album intact.

He was consecrated as Archbishop of Olomouc (Olm√ºtz) in 1819 and became cardinal in the same year. Rudolph is known for his patronage of the arts, most notably as sponsor of Ludwig van Beethoven who dedicated several of his works to him.  Biography  Born in the Pitti Palace in Florence, Tuscany, he was the youngest son of Emperor Leopold II and Maria Louisa of Spain. In 1803 or 1804, Rudolph began taking lessons in piano and composition from Ludwig van Beethoven. The two became friends, and Rudolph became a supporter and patron of Beethoven; their meetings continued until 1824. Beethoven dedicated 14 compositions to Rudolph, including the Archduke Trio, the Hammerklavier Sonata, the Emperor Concerto and the Missa Solemnis. Piano Sonata No. 26 - Les Adieux (\\"The Farewells\\") was gifted to Rudolf just before his flight from Vienna with the Royal family on the occasion of the 1809 invasion by Napoleon. The movements are \\"Lebewohl\\", \\"Abwesenheit\\", and \\"Wiedersehen\\" ('farewell', 'absence', and 'reunion'). Rudolph dedicated one of his own compositions to Beethoven. The letters Beethoven wrote to Rudolph are today kept at the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna. Schubert and Ferdinand Ries also dedicated works to Rudolf.See IMSLP: Schubert's Piano Sonata No.16 (D.845) and Ries' piano quartet Op.129 in E minor. On 24 March 1819 aged 31 Rudolph was appointed, Archbishop of Olomouc, in the present day Czech Republic but then part of the Austrian Empire. He was made Cardinal- Priest of the titular church of S. Pietro in Montorio by Pope Pius VII on 4 June 1819. He was ordained a priest on 29 August 1819, and consecrated a bishop on 26 September. In 1823‚Äì24, he was one of the 50 composers who composed a variation on a waltz by Anton Diabelli for Vaterl√§ndischer K√ºnstlerverein. In Rudolph's case, the music was published anonymously, as by \\"S.R.D\\" (standing for Serenissimus Rudolfus Dux). He died on 24 July 1831 of a cerebral hemorrhage in Baden bei Wien at the age of 43 and was interred in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna; his heart was buried in the crypt in Saint Wenceslas Cathedral in Olomouc.

It involves building across Kalasa and Banduri, two tributaries of the Mahadayi river to divert 7.56 TMC of water to the Malaprabha river, which supplies the drinking water needs of the said 4 districts, i.e., Dharwad, Belagavi Bagalkot and Gadag. This project had been on paper for decades and the Karnataka government decided to implement it during S M Krishna's regime. Clearance for the project was received from the center in 2002. The project however, soon ran into trouble when the then Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of Goa headed by Manohar Parrikar raised objections to the project claiming that the project would harm Goa's flora and fauna. Following this, the then National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government which was in power at the center put on hold its approval and funding of the project. Karnataka and Goa have since then been at loggerheads over the project. The project which had been put in abeyance for four years was revived after H. D. Kumaraswamy became the Chief Minister. In September 2006, the coalition government in Karnataka headed by Chief Minister H. D. Kumaraswamy decided to go ahead with the construction work. It was inaugurated on 22 September at Kanakumbi in Khanapur Taluk of Belgaum District. The Goa government, however, soon moved the courts and brought a stay on the construction work. The matter is now before the Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal. Protest to Implement the Project Communist Party of India (Marxist) organized a rally in Belagavi on 16th Sept, 2015 to implement this long time-pending project. CPI(M) State Secretary GV Srirama Reddy along with his colleague Swamy, Varalaxmi and district secretary G.M. Jaine Khan lead this rally. GV Srirama Reddy said \\"The present imbroglio on the projects to the long pursued politics between the Congress and the BJP in Karnataka and Goa.\\" Srirama Reddy was critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for throwing the ball in the courts of Congress instead of taking a lead to resolve the dispute: \\"It is unbecoming of a Prime Minister to take a political stand based on his political differences with Congress on an issue concerning people.\\".Protest to Implement the Project A statewide bandh was organized by pro-Kannada organizations on Sept 26, 2015 demanding the implementation of the project. The agitation in the malaprabha catchment area under various organisations has now reached 265 days.

Her length is 135.7 m, width 16.8 m, draft 2.9 m, and power 3 √ó 736 kW (2208). She has three engines and four decks. Her cruising speed is , and her passenger capacity is 400. During the 1980s Aleksandr Suvorov was a flagship of the Volga-Don Lines and was based at Rostov-on-Don. 1983 accident On 5 June 1983 Aleksandr Suvorov sailed from Rostov to Moscow. There were 330 passengers, 30 crew and 35 service personnel aboard. It is believed that some unregistered passengers were also aboard the ship. At approximately 22:00 an auction was advertised as taking place in the cinema hall on the upper deck. A TV translation was to take place at 22:45, which attracted many passengers to the upper deck. The chief mate Vladimir Mitenkov and helmsman Uvarov operated the ship from the wheelhouse, which was also on the upper deck. Captain Vladimir Kleymenov was resting in his cabin. The ship was sailing at , the maximum speed. The ship reached the sixth span of the bridge (instead of passable second span) which was lower than the main deck. At that moment a freight train went over the bridge. Controllers at the bank had noticed that Aleksandr Suvorov had come to the wrong span. They sent a radio message to the ship, but there was no reply. They then launched a warning flare, but it was too late. The span cut the deck house and the cinema hall, whilst the lowest deck was undamaged. The impact damaged the bridge, derailed some cars, and some of their contents fell onto the ship. Aleksandr Suvorov continued for another 300 metres (1000 ft) after the bridge. The rescue boats reached Aleksandr Suvorov 40 minutes later. Soon after the tragedy Ulyanovsk was declared a closed city. Volunteers became blood donors and made makeshift coffins. Most of the injured survivors had avulsed wounds as a result of being hit by grain and coal from the train cars.  Investigation  Immediately after the catastrophe different versions of events circulated amongst the population, varying from the drunkenness of the crew to criminal activity. A special commission under Heydar Aliyev investigated the disaster. The commission proposed four official versions: # criminal negligence of chief mate Mitenkov # criminal negligence of helmsman Uvarov # criminal negligence of the railwaymen, who did not set up the illumination of the bridge # there was no illumination at the bridge There was a switch tower on the bridge which looked similar to the navigation sign which was there to indicate the right span to use for passing under the bridge. Railwaymen and sailors had previously argued about the illumination of the bridge, but there was speculation that Aliyev protected the Soviet Railways minister Boris Beshchev and the crew of the Suvorov were accused. An expert proved that Mitenkov and Uvarov, who were killed in the accident, were sober. After the accident, Captain Kleymenov was picked up at the dam near the bridge footing. He was in swimming trunks and was distraught. As he had failed to prevent the accident and had not provided a proper order, he was condemned to ten years imprisonment, but was released six years later. He died of an infarction in 1990.

Axion estin (Greek: , Slavonic: –î–æ—Å—Ç√≥–π–Ω–æ √©—Å—Ç—å, Dost√≥ino yes≈•), or It is Truly Meet, is a megalynarion and a theotokion, i.e. a magnificationIn the archaic sense of the word; see of and a Hymn to Mary used in the Divine Services of the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic churches. It consists of a troparion and a sticheron composed in honor of the Theotokos (i.e. the Virgin Mary). Axion estin is also the name of an icon of the Theotokos as well as of a style of icons modeled from it.  Hymn = Text  The hymn in Greek is: > > One translation of the hymn goes as follows: > It is truly right to bless thee, O Theotokos, > thou the ever blessed, and most pure, and the Mother of our God. > Thou the more honorable than the cherubim, > and beyond compare more glorious than the seraphim, > who without corruption gavest birth to God the Word, > thou the true Theotokos, we magnify thee.  History  The second half of the hymn, beginning with the words, \\"More honorable than the cherubim...\\" is the older part of the hymn, and is an Irmos attributed to St. Cosmas the Hymnographer (‚Ä† 773). The introduction, \\"It is truly meet...\\" was, according to tradition, revealed by the Archangel Gabriel to a monk on Mount Athos.  Liturgical use  The hymn is chanted at Matins, Compline, and other services; but its most important occurrence is at the Divine Liturgy, where it is chanted at the conclusion of the Anaphora. The second half of the hymn, \\"More honorable‚Ä¶\\" is frequently chanted before the dismissal which concludes services. Often, the chanting of this hymn is followed by either a metania or a prostration. = Hymns in place of the Axion Estin = Icon of the Theotokos, \\"All of Creation Rejoices in Thee.\\" During the Divine Liturgy, Axion Estin is sometimes replaced by another hymn to the Theotokos. These hymns are referred to in the service books as \\"in place of Axion Estin\\" (Slavonic: –ó–∞–¥–æ—Å—Ç–æ–π–Ω–Ω–∏–∫—ä, Zadostoinnik), or by the term \\"eis to Exairetos\\", meaning \\"at the Especially (petition),\\" from the petition that precedes them calling \\"especially\\" for the intercessions of the Theotokos. At the Liturgy of St. Basil, it has since the 14th century \\"Venerable Gregory Domesticus of the Great Lavra of Mt Athos\\", Retrieved 2014-04-15 been replaced by the hymn: In Greek: > Translation thereof: > All of Creation rejoices in thee, O full of grace: > the angels in heaven and the race of men, > O sanctified temple and spiritual paradise, > the glory of virgins, of whom God was incarnate > and became a child, our God before the ages. > He made thy body into a throne, > and thy womb more spacious than the heavens. > All of creation rejoices in thee, O full of grace: > Glory be to thee. On the Great Feasts, it is replaced by the Irmos of the ninth Ode of the Canon of the Feast. During Paschaltide (Pentecostarion) Axion estin is replaced in Anaphora by The Angel Cried-hymn: In Greek: > Translation: > The angel cried to the Lady Full of Grace: > Rejoice, O Pure Virgin! Again I say: Rejoice! > Your Son is risen from His three days in the tomb! > With Himself He has raised all the dead! > Rejoice, all you people! > > Shine! Shine! O New Jerusalem! > The Glory of the Lord has shone on you! > Exalt now and be glad, O Zion! > Be radiant, O Pure Theotokos, > in the Resurrection of your Son!  Icon and Origin  Axion Estin is also the name given to the icon of the Theotokos (Mother of God) before which, according to tradition, the hymn was revealed. It stands in the high place of the altar (sanctuary) of the katholikon (main church) of Karyes on Mount Athos. According to tradition, an Elder and his disciple lived in a cell on Mount Athos. One Saturday night the Elder left to attend the All-Night Vigil in Karyes. He told his disciple to chant the service alone. That evening an unknown monk who called himself Gabriel, came to the cell, and they began the Vigil together. During the Ninth Ode of the Canon, when they began to sing the Magnificat, the disciple sang the original hymn \\"More honorable than the Cherubim‚Ä¶\\" and afterwards the visiting monk chanted it again, but with \\"It is truly meet‚Ä¶\\" preceding the original Irmos. As he sang, the icon began to radiate with Uncreated Light. When the disciple asked the visiting monk to write the words of the new hymn down, he took a roof tile and wrote on it with his finger, as though the tile were made of wax. The disciple knew then that this was no ordinary monk, but the Archangel Gabriel. At that moment the Archangel disappeared, but the icon of the Mother of God continued to radiate light for some time afterward. The Eleousa (\\"merciful\\") Icon of the Mother of God, before which the hymn \\"It Is Truly Meet\\" was first chanted, was transferred to the katholikon (main church) at Karyes, known as the Protaton. The tile, with the hymn written on it, was taken to Constantinople when St. Nicholas II Chrysoberges was Patriarch (984-996). Since that time the icon has been considered the protector of the Holy Mountain and its holiest object.  Feast Day  The feast day celebrating the revelation of the hymn by the Archangel Gabriel, and the Icon of the Theotokos of the same name, is celebrated on June 13.

It is part of the Royal Museums for Art and History (RMAH) and internationally renowned for its collection of over 8,000 instruments. History The MIM collection was created in 1877 and was originally attached to the Royal Conservatory of Brussels with the purpose of demonstrating early instruments to students. It consisted of a hundred Indian instruments given to King Leopold II of Belgium by Rajah Sourindro Mohun Tagore in 1876, as well as the collection of the celebrated Belgian musicologist Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis, purchased by the Belgian government in 1872, and put on deposit in the Conservatory, where F√©tis was the first director. Its first curator, Victor- Charles Mahillon, greatly expanded the already impressive collection, and by the time of his death in 1924, the MIM consisted of some 3,666 articles, among which 3,177 were original musical instruments. He was noted for his astute judgments in obtaining these large collections by calling on philanthropists, mixing with erudite amateurs who sometimes became generous donors, and through friendly relations with Belgian diplomats in foreign posts, who sometimes brought back instruments from beyond Europe. Trombone with seven bells by Adolphe Sax (1876, Paris) The monumental five-volume catalogue of the collection Mahillon commissioned, between 1880 and 1922, also included four versions of his essay on the methodical classification of both ancient and modern instruments, which was to serve as the basis for the organological Hornbostel-Sachs classification systems, still used today. Beginning in 1877, Mahillon also created a restoration workshop in the MIM, where he employed and trained a worker, Franz de Vestibule, to restore damaged articles and make copies of unique instruments in other public collections. Mahillon's successor at the Conservatory, Fran√ßois-Auguste Gevaert, organised several successful concerts of professors and students playing early instruments, in the 1880s. After the First World War, as donors and philanthropists as well as Belgium's famed instrument makers started becoming scarcer, only about a thousand instruments were added to the collections between 1924 and 1968. Until 1957, the curators at the head of the MIM; Ernest Closson (1924‚Äì1936), his son Herman (1936‚Äì1945), and Ren√© Lyr (1945‚Äì1957) limited themselves to preserving the already collected instruments, in not always satisfactory conditions. Ernest is notable for editing several articles on Belgian makers for the National Biography and devoting a long monograph to La facture des instruments de musique en Belgique, which appeared at the 1935 International Exposition held in Brussels. With the arrival of the esteemed Latinist Roger Bragard, curator between 1957 and 1968, larger budgets became available from the Ministry of Culture, as exhibits were renovated, new personnel were hired, concerts were again organised, and new rare pieces were collected. His efforts were pursued by his successors Ren√© de Maeyer (1968‚Äì1989), Nicolas Mee√πs (1989‚Äì1995), and Malou Haine (1995‚Äì2009). serpents) on display Exhibits The museum's collection presents Belgian musical history (including Brussels' importance in the making of recorders and various obscure proto-synthesizers (Ondes Martenot, Theremin, etc.) in the 18th and 19th centuries and as the home of instrument inventor Adolphe Sax in the 19th century), European musical traditions, and non-European instruments. Mechanical instruments are shown in the basement, traditional instruments on the ground floor, the development of the modern orchestral instruments on the first floor, and keyboard and stringed instruments on the second floor. Visitors are given infrared headphones in order to listen to almost 200 musical extracts of the instruments on display. Information is provided in French and Dutch, though not in English. Among the notable pieces of the collection are the famous Rottenburgh Alto recorder, instruments invented by Adolphe Sax, a unique set of giant Chinese stone chimes, and the only existing copy of the luth√©al, an instrument used by Ravel. Besides exhibiting the permanent collection, the museum occasionally also programs temporary exhibitions and concerts of influential contemporary inventors such as the Baschet Brothers, Pierre Bastien, Yuri Landman, Logos Foundation and others. Location and accessibility Since 2000, the museum has been located in the former Old England department store, built in 1899 by Paul Saintenoy out of girded steel and glass in the Art Nouveau style, as well as the adjoining 18th-century neoclassical building designed by Barnab√© Guimard. Located at 2, / on the Mont des Arts/Kunstberg, the museum stands next to the Place Royale/Koningsplein and in front of the Magritte Museum.

A pendant light, sometimes called a drop or suspender, is a lone light fixture that hangs from the ceiling usually suspended by a cord, chain, or metal rod. Pendant lights are often used in multiples, hung in a straight line over kitchen countertops and dinette sets or sometimes in bathrooms. Pendants come in a huge variety of sizes and vary in materials from metal to glass or concrete and plastic. Many modern pendants are energy-saving low voltage models and some use halogen or fluorescent bulbs. A billiard or island light is a longer pendant fixture, usually with long fluorescent or multiple incandescent bulbs, used over kitchen islands and billiard tables. They are sometimes considered a type of chandelier. It is a key component to understanding architectural lighting design and sometimes associated with interior design.  Sizing rules  Since pendant lights are typically smaller and placed in sets, it is important to follow general lighting rules to avoid creating poor lighting. An odd number of pendants is preferable to an even amount. Typically, 60-75 watt equivalent lights are needed for every 20 inches of counter space. Regarding height, pendants should be placed high enough to allow an unobstructed view while either sitting or standing. Pendants should be placed 28-38 inches above a counter top, or 72 inches above the floor.

More than 20 were killed and more than 30 injured in friendly fire between the Russian units. Chechen rebels, allegedly helped by the local militia, were initially blamed for the attack, but independent journalists uncovered the facts, forcing the authorities to admit the truth.Russia invented ambush by Chechens to hide friendly-fire massacre The ambush The Omonovtsy (OMON officers) from Sergiyev Posad were travelling in a marked convoy of nine trucks, a bus, and a command car, with no protection by armored vehicles and no helicopter cover, to an Interior Ministry forces outpost in the Podgornoye area of the Staropromyslovsky city district of the Chechen capital, Grozny. Their approach had been reported, but they had not been identified, and they were suspected to be either Chechen guerrillas attempting to infiltrate the city or reinforcements for the pro- Moscow Chechen militia, which was also in conflict with the Sverdlovsk police. The Podolsk and Sverdlovsk policemen were waiting to ambush them, and when the column approached an improvised roadblock made with a wrecked bus, it suddenly and without warning came under shoot-to-kill fire, including from heavy machine guns and grenade launchers. Of the 98 troops in the convoy, at least 22 were reported killed (including the unit's commander, Colonel Dimitry Markelov, killed in the first minutes of the attack) and 31 (or 38) were wounded. At least two members of the Podolsk unit were reported to have been killed by return fire. Moscow officials stated at first that only 12 men had been killed. A day later the chief-of-staff of the Russian military in the North Caucasus said that the death toll had risen to 37. The attack lasted for over an hour and was videotaped by a Russian officer. Official whitewash and reprisals in Chechnya Immediately after the incident, Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) officials reported that the convoy had been ambushed by Chechen rebels and that the other Russian forces were reinforcements. Baultdin Bakuyev, a Chechen field commander, also took responsibility, saying the attack was an act of revenge for the OMON's atrocities in Chechnya. Dozens of local men were detained after the incident. Some were killed by Russian OMON troops during the course of the hunt for the alleged Chechen attackers; others were forcibly disappeared. One of the detainees, Shakhid Baysayev, was videotaped. His body has never been found, but he was declared legally dead by the European Court of Human Rights in 2007, presumed to have been killed by Russian forces while in custody. Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo attended the funeral of the dead troops and vowed that the rebels responsible for their deaths would be identified and \\"retribution dealt out accordingly\\".Russia insists it's winning Chechnya war despite losses He added that any Interior Ministry superiors responsible would also be punished. It was soon announced that three suspected rebels alleged to have been involved in the attack had been charged with murder, and foreign journalists received supposed video footage of the attack on the convoy. However, the detained \\"rebels\\" were later discharged and the video was said to be footage of a different ambush. Criminal negligence trial In a closed trial in 2002, a court acquitted two senior Interior Ministry officers, Major-General Boris Fadeyev (former deputy head of the Moscow Oblast Interior Ministry department and head of the Moscow traffic police) and Colonel Mikhail Levchenko (former head of the command group of the Interior Ministry's force in Chechnya), of criminal negligence. The court instead laid blame posthumously on Colonel Markelov. Major Igor Tikhonov, ex-commander of Podolsk OMON, was excused from the proceedings on health grounds.Court Acquits OMON Officers See also *Ingush-Chechen fratricide incident ReferencesExternal links *Chechnya: Two Federal Disasters, Conflict Studies Research Centre, April 2002 * –ß–µ—á–Ω—è. –ö—Ä–æ–≤—å –Ω–∞ –ø–æ–≥–æ–Ω–∞—Ö (TV documentary) Category:2000 in Russia Category:Battles of the Second Chechen War Category:Friendly fire incidents OMON Category:Law enforcement in Russia Category:Trials in Russia Category:March 2000 events in Europe ","title":"Grozny OMON fratricide incident"},{"id":"10091209","text":"Xmas tree can be: *A colloquial abbreviation for a Christmas tree. **It is also the proper name for such an object in the 31st century world of Futurama. *The more common spelling for the oilfield Christmas tree. *The name given to the set of lights used for starting a drag race.

Her full name was Mary Magdalene Garland Stewart Jackson Stamos. Biography Jackson was born in Clay County, Kentucky as the daughter of Oliver Perry Garland and Deborah Robinson.Kleber 1992, p. 459. In 1883, her father opened a store in Laurel County selling groceries to miners on credit. When the miners failed to make their payments, he was forced to close it two years later to go to work in the coal mines. Her mother died of tuberculosis when she was six years old.Hevener 2002, p. 66. Because her family were involved in union activities, Jackson was thrown in jail at the age of ten. She began learning songs from her great- grandmother, Nancy MacMahan, at an early age. In 1894, she married the miner Jim Stewart. She bore two children. For the next decade, she worked as a nurse in Clay County before moving to Harlan County in 1908 and a job as a midwife delivering 884 babies. Her husband was killed in a mine accident in 1917 and shortly afterwards, she married the miner Bill Jackson. Tragedies struck her family when her father and a brother were blinded in another mine accident. She became a member of the United Mine Workers and began writing protest songs like \\"I Am A Union Woman\\", \\"Kentucky Miner's Wife\\", and \\"Poor Miner's Farewell\\". When Jackson was jailed because of her unionizing activities, her husband was forced to divorce her in order to keep his mining job.Hevener 2002, p. 67. She was discovered in November 1931 by the Dreiser Committee, investigating the Harlan County War and workers' living conditions when she spoke and sang her song \\"Ragged, Hungry Blues\\" in front of the committee.Weissman 2006, p. 42. In December 1931, Jackson traveled to New York City to support and raise money for striking Harlan coal miners,Romalis 1998, p. 2. at one point appearing before an estimated crowd of 21,000 at the Bronx Coliseum.The Encyclopedia of Strikes in American History, by Aaron Brenner, Benjamin Day, and Immanuel Ness, page 111 Jackson made her recording debut on December 10, 1931.Russell 2004, p. 452. For the next year, she performed in various cities in the north. She stayed in New York for much of that decade and was a part of the Greenwich Village folk revival, singing for Alan Lomax at the Library of Congress, and influencing folk singers from Woody Guthrie to Pete Seeger. In the mid-1930s, she performed in New York City together with Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Earl Robinson, Will Geer, her half-brother Jim Garland, and her half-sister Sarah Ogan Gunning. After a bus accident in Ohio, leaving her badly crippled, Jackson became incapacitated and was confined to her New York apartment. She died in 1960 and was interred as Mary Stamos, next to her husband Gust Stamos, at the Odd Fellows Lawn Cemetery in Sacramento, California. The given dates of Aunt Molly Jackson's life are mostly uncertain since she was inconsistent when giving them. Folklorist Archie Green became very frustrated during interviews with her, due to her \\"elastic responses\\", inconsistent elaborations and \\"flexible dates.\\" It was not unusual for her to contradict her own prior accounts.Romalis 1998, p. 4.

The Articles were designed to settle a controversy that had arisen at Cambridge University regarding whether God predestines men to eternal life and eternal damnation. To clarify the situation, Whitgift drew up a list to define clearly the doctrines of Calvinism, which adhered to a predestinarian view. The Lambeth Articles (also known as the Nine Articles) were drafted by William Whitaker, Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge. He had been sent to Whitgift by the heads of Cambridge University, along with Humphrey Tyndal, Dean of Ely, in order to settle the controversy. The Articles were originally drafted by Whitaker and modified later by Bishops to make them more acceptable to anti- Calvinists. They were signed by Archbishop Whitgift, Richard Fletcher, Bishop of London, Richard Vaughan, Bishop elect of Bangor, and others. The Articles # The eternal election of some to life, and the reprobation of others to death. # The moving cause of predestination to life is not the foreknowledge of faith and good works, but only the good pleasure of God. # The number of the elect is unalterably fixed. # Those who are not predestinated to life shall necessarily be damned for their sins. # The true faith of the elect never fails finally nor totally. # A true believer, or one furnished with justifying faith, has a full assurance and certainty of remission and everlasting salvation in Christ. # Saving grace is not communicated to all men. # No man can come to the Son unless the Father shall draw him, but all men are not drawn by the Father. # It is not in every one's will and power to be saved. The Articles were written on 20 November 1595 and sent to Cambridge University on 24 November. They were not intended as new laws, but as an explanation of the existing laws of the realm. However, they had not received the Queen's sanction, and although Whitgift maintained that he had Elizabeth's approval, her later actions seem to suggest the contrary. Whitgift said that the Articles should be used privately, with discretion. Queen's reaction When Queen Elizabeth I discovered that the Articles had been submitted and discussed at a synod without her permission or authority, she was very angry and ordered that the archbishop recall and suppress the Articles immediately. This was partly due to her unfavourable attitude towards Calvinism in general - she preferred a milder, more compromising approach in her Religious Settlement of 1559 and wished to keep it that way - and partly because Whitgift, although one of her favourites, had acted on a matter of religion without her knowledge or consent, which she wanted to discourage. This reluctance to change her Settlement or increase the influence of radical Protestantism or Puritanism can be seen in her treatment of William Strickland when he introduced a reform bill to Parliament in 1571. Later reactions The Lambeth Articles were accepted at the 1615 Convocation of Dublin and consequently engrafted on the Irish Articles (written by James Ussher). One can find the basis of the Five Points of Calvinism contained in the Canons of Dort (1618‚Äì19) in the Lambeth Articles.

This causes him to develop depression, which is worsened by the fact that his oldest sister, Ellie Mills (Sarah Baxendale), has been missing in Ibiza for over two years. She later arrives in Hollyoaks in 2002. Things get more problematic for Lee when his sister, Lisa (Gemma Atkinson) is bullied by jealous classmate, Steph Dean (Carley Stenson), which causes her to self-harm. With the help of his family, Lee supports Lisa, and vows to for the entirety of his life. Lee gradually becomes close friends with Bombhead (Lee Otway). Lee's delighted when he starts to make money by schemes, but they often go wrong. Lee grows close to Abby Davies (Helen Noble) and begins a relationship with her, which has various ups and downs. However, Lee has a fling with Abby's best friend, Zara Morgan (Kelly Greenwood). Lee proposes to Abby and she accepts before leaving for the university in Brighton. Lee becomes miserable after her departure, which annoys his friends. He visits Abby and finds her in bed with another man, which leaves him devastated, especially when Abby breaks off their engagement. Abby tells him she made a mistake accepting his proposal. Subsequently, there was more bad news to face Lee when Ellie loses her memory, and accuses their brother Dan (Andrew McNair) for killing her murderous husband, Toby Mills. Lee and the Hunter family turn against her for this. One year later, Dan died from car explosion. Lee accuses Ellie of mistreating Dan, and tells her, with the support of Lisa, that he no longer sees her as part of the family, causing Ellie to leave Hollyoaks. Lee starts a beauty therapy course at Hollyoaks Community College, after he fails to enrol in film studies due to his poor grades. He becomes college president and alienates Bombhead. Lee's opponent Chris Fenwick (Chris Grierson) becomes vice president after Lee accepts him. Chris attempts to manipulate Lee into spending more than what the college fund has. Lee refuses to believe Bombhead when he tells him what Chris is doing. After the revelation, Lee doesn't speak to Bombhead because he thinks that he stole the missing money. Chris and Freddy Watson (Greg Kelly) frame Lee for the fire at the media lab, which Freddy actually caused. Zara saves Lee when she reveals Freddy's plot to the college council.

However, he believes Leanne when the group turn against Kevin and accuses him of lying. Lee grows close to Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies), after helping her with her college project. After Amy successfully performs her stand-up routine, Lee is shocked when Amy kisses him. Lee admits to Leanne that he kissed Amy, but she forgives him. Lee tells her that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. Lee finds a poster asking for directors to put on a production. He cunningly removes the poster and successfully applies for the position. He writes a script for a play named 'MasKara' and casts Jem Costello (Helen Russell-Clark) and Jamil Fadel (Sikander Malik) in the lead roles. Lee also casts Texas Longford (Bianca Hendrickse-Spendlove) Lee tries to hang some decorations for the production and falls off the ladder, hurting his neck. Due to Lee's absence, Steph takes over the production, making drastic changes and hiring Carmel Valentine (Gemma Merna) as the makeup artist. Lee is keen to see what Steph has changed in the production, but is horrified when he sees the costumes and props. He storms off, but then returns to give the production another go; however begins another argument and eventually upsets Steph after cruelly mentioning her cancer. Due to Lee's actions, Jem quits and Lee decides to re-cast the leading part to Amy. On the day of the production, he is forced by the cast members to apologise to Steph and does so. Things however are not sorted, as Darren fails to remember his lines and quits last minute. Lee, with no other options, casts himself as the part that Darren was scheduled to play. The production receives positive feedback from the cheering audience, however Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) writes a review which harshly criticises Lee's dictating directing skills. Lee and Amy remain good friends and eventually Lee admits to Amy he believes he should not be marrying Leanne because he isn't attracted to her anymore. They kiss and fall asleep next to each other, which Leanne witnesses. When she moves the wedding forwards, Lee promises Amy that he's going to dump Leanne for her. However, the situation changes when Amy is hospitalized after being injured in a fire at Il Gnosh restaurant caused by Dominic Reilly (John Pickard). Lee then tells Leanne the news, but she doesn't care and tells him that she wouldn't be upset if Amy dies. Lee then visits Steph's family to give them her farewell CD, as she died in the fire, whilst saving Amy and her children. Amy then makes a life-changing decision to leave Hollyoaks and ends her relationship with Lee. He is devastated, which Leanne exploits in order to grow closer to him in the hope that he will take her back. In January, Amy returns to the village and she and Lee reconcile, and get engaged. When Amy applies for a teaching job, Lee sees her talking to an older man and getting the wrong impression, and angrily confronts him. Lee also becomes jealous when she befriends Dodger Savage (Danny Mac). When Dodger gives her driving lessons and a false driver's licence, Lee reports him to the police but Amy is arrested and fined. After falling out with Lee over this, Amy has a one-night stand with Dodger, but guiltily confesses to Lee later. Lee angrily confronts Dodger and a fight breaks out between them which Amy witnesses. She dumps Lee for his embarrassing actions. After Lee apologizes and forgives her for sleeping with Dodger, he and Amy reconcile and set a date for their wedding. In October 2011, Lee's offered a job in New York City, which he accepts. He and Amy plan to move there with her children, but Amy's ex-boyfriend Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson), who is the father of her son Lucas (William Hall), finds out about this, he tells them he won't let them take the children. Lee and Amy then invite him to join them in New York, and he accepts their offer, but cannot get a VISA due to his criminal record. Consequently, Ste then tells them he doesn't want his children to go, so Lee reluctantly turns down the job offer, much to the shock of Amy and Ste. Amy then buys Lee tickets to New York, so he's able to go. She tells him that she won't be going with him, so Lee leaves on his own in a taxi for the airport. Character creation and casting Alex Carter successfully auditioned for the role of Lee Hunter in 2001 and joined the cast of Hollyoaks as the youngest son of Les (John Graham Davies) and Sally Hunter (Katherine Dow Blyton) and brother to Ellie (Sarah Baxendale), Dan (Andrew McNair) and Lisa (Gemma Atkinson).

I wanted a bit of a life as well as work.\\" In an interview with OK! magazine in 2010, Carter discussed the reasons why he initially quit Hollyoaks commenting, \\"When I left Hollyoaks originally, in 2005, I was quite tired and ready to go, because of the schedules.\\" In 2011, Paul Marquess was appointed as the new Hollyoaks producer. He planned to give Hollyoaks a \\"shake up\\", changing the productions team, writing characters out and replacing them with new ones. It was announced on 15 March 2010, that Marquess had decided to reintroduce Lee to the serial as part of his revamp. Carter signed an initial six-month contract with the soap after announcing his decision to leave his role as Jamie Hope in Emmerdale. In an interview with entertainment website Digital Spy about Lee's return, Marquess explained, \\"He turns up with another character. He's been working as a Gareth Gates impersonator on a cruise ship and he won't just have light stories because Alex is great. He's one of our new students. The thing about our new students is the audience will recognise some of them.\\" Carter revealed that he has previously been in talks with Marquess' predecessor Allan, whom he knew from previously working on the show. In July 2010, it was announced that Carter would make his comeback scenes as Lee in new online spin-off Hollyoaks: Freshers. Speaking of his appearance in the spin-off, Carter said he was thrilled, commenting, \\"I'm thrilled to be back and it's really exciting that my first episodes are for the online spin- off.\\" In the same month it was announced that Jessica Forrest had been cast as Lee's girlfriend Leanne Holiday. Digital Spy reported that Leanne would also appear in the spin-off before making her first appearance in Hollyoaks as a new student.

Near Eastern mythology The Assyrian and Babylonian concept of origins expressed procreation first in ‚Äúrelationships between gods and goddesses resulting in other gods and goddesses,\\" such as Ea and Damkina assisted by Apsu giving birth to Marduk. The Akkadian En√ªma Eli≈° describes the birth of Marduk as follows: \\"Ea, having overheard the plan of the primordial deities to destroy the other gods, deceived Apsu and Mummu and put them to death. 'Ea, his triumph over his enemies secured, in his sacred chamber in profound peace he rested.' (ANET, p. 61, lines 74‚Äî75.) Then he took over the place which Apsu had used for his cult and dwelt there with his spouse, Damkina.\\" It was here that Marduk, the \\"most potent and wisest of gods\\" was created in the heart of Apsu and \\"He who begot him was Ea, his father, she who conceived him was Damkina, his mother\\". According to Norman Lockyer, Ea, Ia, or Oannes was the primal god of Babylon. He was a ‚ÄòGreat God, Maker of Men, Potter, Artist and Workman.‚Äô He formed a Triad with Anu and Bil‚Äîthe two poles of heaven and the equator.Lockyer, Norman, The dawn of astronomy : a study of temple worship and mythology of the ancient Egyptians. With a preface by Giorgio de Santillana, Mineola, NY. : Dover Publications, Inc., 2006. Oannes first appeared from the sea to teach the Babylonians the art of writing, sciences and crafts, the building of cities, the surveying of land, the observation of the stars, and the sowing and harvesting of all kinds of grains and plants. He was believed to have been \\"reincarnated\\" several times. Berossos, priest of the Temple of Bel, in Babylon, knew of as many as six such reincarnations.Orpheus the fisher; comparative studies in Orphic and early Christian cult symbolism, J. M. Watkins, London, 1921 In addition, ‚Äúprocreative deities, either male or female, played a part in the birth of other deities or great personages, such as the Ugaritic tradition of Lady Asherah, ‚Äòthe Progenitress of the gods‚Äô; Mami, 'the Mother-womb, the one who creates mankind'; Father Nanna, the 'begetter of gods and men'; the Assyrian traditions that Tukulti-Urta was created by the gods in the womb of his mother and that Sennacherib's birth was assisted by Ea, who provided a 'spacious womb', and Assur, 'the god, my begetter'; and the North Arabian myth of the mother goddess who was responsible for Dusares.\\"Boslooper, Thomas, The Virgin Birth, The Westminster Press, Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 62-7941. In Hittite mythology, the god Anu was overthrown by his son Kumarbi; Anu attempted to flee, but Kumarbi bit off Anu's genitals and swallowed them, and banished him to the underworld. As a consequence of swallowing Anu's genitals, Kumarbi became impregnated with Anu's son Teshub and four other offspring. Teshub overthrew his father Kumarbi, thus avenging his other father Anu's overthrow and mutilation. This account later became the basis for the Greek story of Uranus's castration by his son Cronus, resulting in the birth of Aphrodite, described in Hesiod's Theogony. Egyptian mythology=Gods thumbright300pxIsis, in the form of a bird, copulates with the deceased Osiris. At either side are Horus, although he is as yet unborn, and Isis in human form. The belief in the conception of Horus by Isis is traced to the beginning of Egyptian history. Horus' conception and birth were understood in terms of the Egyptian doctrine of parthenogenesis, which was connected with the goddess Neith of Sais. (page 220)Budge, E. A. Wallis, The Gods of the Egyptians, II, Dover Publications, New York, 1904 In Upper Egypt, Net was worshipped at Seni and represented with the head of a lioness painted green, with the titles: \\"Father of fathers and Mother of mothers,\\" and \\"net-Menhit, the great lady, lady of the south, the great cow who gave birth to the sun, who made the germ of gods and men, the mother of Ra, who raised up Tem in primeval time, who existed when nothing else had being, and who created that which exists after she had come into being.\\"(page 150)Erman, Adolf, The Literature of the Ancient Egyptians, B. Blom, New York, 1971, 1927 There were at least fifteen other Horuses in the Egyptian pantheon, so in the story of Isis and Osiris Horus is \\"sometimes known as Harsiesis, to distinguish him from the others. He is depicted as a falcon, or with a falcon's head. He eventually avenged Osiris' death and reclaimed the throne, ruling peacefully...Herakhty, or 'Horus of the Horizon', was a sun god who rose each morning on the eastern horizon. He was often identified with the sun god, Ra, and was eventually absorbed by him, forming Ra-Herakhty.\\" Lineal descent from Ra, whether by birth or by marriage, was claimed by all kings of Egypt at least since User-ka-f, first king of the V Dynasty, who was high priest of Ra at Heliopolis. An important part of this tradition was the legend of the God Re generating with the wife of a priest. \\"The newborn child was regarded as a god incarnate, and later with appropriate ceremonies he was presented to Re or Amen-Re, in his temple, where the god accepted it and acknowledged it to be his child.\\" This tradition was later inscribed in a stereotyped form in temple reliefs. Many texts mention different attributes of Isis. These were combined into a single narrative by Plutarch in the 1st century AD. In her aspect of protector of Egypt and its people, Isis is depicted with huge outspread wings. She taught women to grind corn, to spin and to weave, and she taught the people how to cure illnesses. She instituted the rite of marriage. When her consort, Osiris, left Egypt to travel the world, Isis ruled the country in his absence. \\"The hieroglyph for her name is the image of a throne, and her lap came to be seen as the throne of Egypt. Because of her fame Isis eventually absorbed the qualities of almost all the other goddesses; \\"she was a great mother goddess, a bird goddess, a goddess of the underworld who brought life to the dead, and a goddess of the primeval waters...Her following spread beyond Egypt to Greece and throughout the Roman Empire...(lasting) from before 3000 BC until well into Christian times.http://www.roman-empire.net/religion/isis.html Pharaohs There is a myth on the birth of Hatshepsut. In this myth, Amun goes to Queen Ahmose in the form of the Pharaoh Thutmose I and awakens her with pleasant odors. At this point Amun places the ankh, a symbol of life, to Ahmose's nose, and Hatshepsut is conceived by Ahmose.Gay Robins, Women in Ancient Egypt, Harvard University Press, 1993 Another myth on divine birth concerns Amenhotep III: he is conceived by Amun which has gone to queen Mutemwiya in form of Thutmosis IV.O' Connor, David and Cline, Eric H.: Amenhotep III:Perspectives of his reign, University of Michigan Press, 2001Tyldesley, Joyce: Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt, Thames & Hudson, 2006 Judaism In the Hebrew Bible, and in later Jewish tradition there are stories of matriarchs giving birth where the God of Israel miraculously intervenes. For example, within the Rabbinic literature expansions were made on the birth of the matriarch Sarah on the earlier Old Testament traditions. Isaac Banishment of Hagar, Etching. √Ä Paris chez Fr. Fanet, √âditeur, Rue des Saints P√®res n¬∞ 10. 18th century. Sarah is seen on the left side, looking Due to her old age, Sarai was infertile, but a miracle was vouchsafed to her (Genesis Rabbah xlvii. 3) after her name was changed from \\"Sarai\\" to \\"Sarah\\" (R. H. 16b). When her youth had been restored and she had given birth to Isaac the people would not believe in the miracle, saying that the patriarch and his wife had adopted a foundling and pretended that it was their own son. Abraham thereupon invited all the notables to a banquet on the day when Isaac was to be weaned. Sarah invited the women, who brought their infants with them, and on this occasion she gave milk from her breasts to all the children, thus convincing the guests of the miracle (B. M. 87a; comp. Gen. R. liii. 13). Immanuel According to Isaiah 7:14, around 735 BC King Ahaz of Judah received a message from the prophet Isaiah during the Syro-Ephraimite War with Aram (Syria) and Israel, \\"Therefore, the Lord, of His own, shall give you a sign; behold, the young woman is with child, and she shall bear a son, and she shall call his name Immanuel.\\" This is generally taken by Judaic commentators to be a reference to the non-miraculous birth of Hezekiah or another contemporary child, as indicated in Isaiah's following indication of the timing. The Greek Septuagint and some later Christian translations, following the application of Isaiah 7 in Matthew 1, use the word \\"virgin\\". The Hebrew word alma actually translates as a young woman of childbearing age who had not yet given birth and who might or might not be a virgin, whereas the Hebrew betulah, used elsewhere in Isaiah, is the word that means \\"virgin.\\" If the reference is to Ahaz's betrothed, Abi, daughter of the High Priest, no miraculous birth is implied, merely chastity. The Christian world believes that the verse is a messianic prediction of the miraculous birth of Jesus, as described in various gospels of the New Testament of the Bible. Melchizedek The Second Book of Enoch contains a section, called Exaltation of Melchizedek, which says that Melchizedek was born of a virgin, Sofonim (or Sopanima), the wife of Nir, a brother of Noah. The child came out from his mother after she had died and sat on the bed beside her corpse, already physically developed, clothed, speaking and blessing the Lord, and marked with the badge of priesthood. Forty days later, Melchizedek was taken by the archangel Gabriel (Michael in some manuscripts) to the Garden of Eden and was thus preserved from the Deluge without having to be in Noah's Ark. Zoroaster Zoroaster‚Äôs name has been adopted from the Greek and Latin Zoroastres. The ancient form of his name in the Avesta is Zarathustra. His native country was probably Media in Western Iran, (possibly in modern Azerbaijan), but his ministry took place in eastern Iran, especially in the region of Bactria, about 1200 BC. Zoroaster was originally a Magian priest, and under the reforms he instituted, Mithra became one of the Yazatas (Worshipful Ones), the angels or lesser divine beings. \\"It was said that (Zoroaster's) birth was foretold from the beginning of time, and that the moment he was born, he burst out laughing and the whole universe rejoiced with him.\\" After his birth evil demons tried to destroy him, but with Ahura Mazda's protection, he survived all attempts on his life. The Zoroastrian tradition differs from the Christian one because the divine only assists in the preservation of Zoroaster‚Äôs seed. \\"The central scripture, the Avesta and also the Pahlavi texts include the tradition that the 'kingly glory' is handed onward from ruler to ruler and from saint to saint for the purpose of illuminating ultimately the soul of the Zarathushtra.\\" Also the scriptures clearly allude to conjugal relations between his parents, during which evil spirits try to prevent his conception. But according to later tradition, Zoroaster's mother, Dughdova, was a virgin when she conceived Zoroaster by a shaft of light.Egyptian mythology, Lorenz, London, 2000 Greco-Roman and Hellenistic mythology=Gods The Birth of Minerva by Ren√©-Antoine Houasse (before 1688) Greco-Roman and Hellenistic literature is rich in the tradition of birth among the gods. In his poem Theogony, the Greek poet Hesiod tells a story that Zeus had once lain with the goddess Metis, impregnating her, but, fearing that she might bear a child mightier than he himself, he swallowed her.Hesiod, Theogony 886 Their daughter Athena was born fully grown from Zeus's forehead, fully armed and clad in armor.Hesiod, Theogony 929a Hesiod also relates that the goddess Aphrodite was born from the foam of the sea after Ouranos's castrated testicles were thrown into it.Hesiod, Theogony 176 Helios was a child of Zeus by Euryphaessa. He was also called \\"the son of Earth and starry Heaven,\\" and the son of Hyperion. Dionysus was dithyrambus, \\"he who entered life by a double door.\\" His first birth took place prematurely. His mother, Semele, died when Zeus appeared to her in a flash of lightning, and so Zeus opened his own flesh and enclosed the infant. In time, Dionysus was born \\"perfect\\" from Zeus' thigh. Dionysus Zagreus was important in Orphic theology. In Protrepticus ii. 14 ff. by Clement of Alexandria, this child had the form of a bull. Zeus intended to make him the ruler of the universe but the jealous Titans lured the child away, tore him to pieces, cooked him and ate him. Athena preserved his heart, however, which Zeus swallowed. According to Boslooper, Clement omitted one part of the myth that forms a connection between his account and the Theban legend of Dionysus. Because Zeus swallowed the heart of Dionysus Zagreus, when Semele bore Dionysus the new god was Zagreus reborn. Mithra and Mithras Roman statue showing Mithras born from the rock from the Diocletian Baths Museum In Indian mythology, Mithra is known as Mitra. He was originally a god of contracts and friendship and was a forerunner of the Graeco-Roman god Mithras. In Iran, he developed into the protector of truth. Before the time of Zoroaster, he was associated with Ahura Mazda, the principle of good. As a consequence of Zoroaster's reforms to Iranian religion, Mithra was ousted from power and Ahura Mazda became supreme. In the more ancient Indian Vedas Mithra was the god of light, invoked under the name of Varuna, and was called \\"the Light of the World.\\" He was the mediator between heaven and Earth. \\"The light bursting from the heavens, which were conceived as a solid vault, became, in the mythology of the Magi, Mithra born from the rock.\\" Mithraism absorbed astrology from the Chaldeans after the Chaldean conquest, and continued as an astronomical religion. In the Hellenistic period it took on its final form. Mithra was assimilated into Graeco-Roman beliefs in the 1st century BC as Mithras. He was an ancient and highly honored god of Roman Paganism, where he was worshipped for more than 300 years as \\"the soldier's god.\\" Mythological heroes Ancient Boeotian bell-krater showing Zeus impregnating Dana√´ in the form of a shower of gold, circa 450-425 BC The love of a god for a mortal, resulting in the birth of a hero, is one notable deviation from the tradition of the origin of gods. The legend of Perseus, whose mother conceived him when Jupiter came to her in the form of a golden shower, is one example of this type (cf. Ovid, Metamorphoses, Book IV). The Greek Anthology has the following: Zeus, turned to gold, piercing the brazen chamber of Danae, cut the knot of intact virginity. Heroes created by generation of a god with a mortal include Ion by Apollo and Creusa, Romulus by Mars and Aemila, Asclepius by Apollo and Coronis, and Helen by Zeus and Leda. Plutarch records how Theseus and Romulus were both born out of wedlock and of uncertain parentage and at the same time had the reputation of being sprung from the gods. He said that Theseus' grandfather Pittheus invented the story that Theseus was the child of Neptune to conceal Theseus' lineage as the son of Pittheus' daughter Aethra and Aegeus (\\"Lives\\", Vol. 1, p. 2; pp. 3 ff.). But there were other stories about the birth of Romulus and his brother Remus. The story of Romulus' divine origin says that his mother was the mortal daughter of Aeneas and Lavinia, and his father was Mars. In his \\"Hymn to Asclepius\\", Homer attributes his origin to the god Apollo and the daughter of a renowned soldier, King Phlegyas. As the divine patron of the healing art, Asclepius became the most popular of the hero gods of Greece. The belief that religion was concerned with sickness and disease was central to his cult. His sanctuaries in the Greco-Roman world became so famous there was a movement to make him a god of the first rank and identify him with Zeus himself. Asclepius was \\"the one who leads and controls all things, the savior of the whole world, and the guardian of mortals.\\" Helen of Troy was worshiped as a heroine in several parts of the ancient world during the early historical epoch. Euripides' play \\"Helen\\" depends on a tradition begun in the early 6th century B.C. by the Greek poet Stesichorus that Helen was the daughter of Zeus (who took the form of a swan) and Leda. But this might simply be a poetic way of saying that she was hatched from an egg. There are two versions of the birth of Oedipus. He was given a semidivine status in Sophocles' \\"Oedipus the King,\\" where he was said to be the son of either Pan, Loxias, \\"or the Bacchants' god, dweller on the hilltops ...\\" and one of the nymphs of Helicon. But in Euripides' \\"Phoenissae,\\" his mother, Jocasta, says Oedupus is the son of Laius, a mortal, who was warned by the god Phoebus not to have children. > \\"King of Thebes for horses famed! seek not to beget children against the > will of heaven; for if thou beget a son, that child will slay thee, and all > thy house shall wade in blood.\\" Laius ignored the warning, but after the child was born he gave him to shepherds to expose on Mount Cithaeron. The child was found and raised among the keepers of the horses of Polybus. As a grown man, Oedipus did indeed kill his father, not realizing who he was, and then married his mother. When he discovered the truth he blinded himself. In this story, he is clearly considered to be the son of Laius and Jocasta. This is also obvious in Sophocles' \\"Oedipus the King\\".The Complete Greek Drama, Eds. Oates and O'Neill, Vol. 1, p. 409, Random House, New York, 1938. According to Boslooper, \\"The two passages indicate that in the Greek mind the thoughts of divine and human paternal participation in conception were not mutually exclusive.\\" (p. 178) The Shepherd Faustulus Bringing Romulus and Remus to His Wife by Nicolas Mignard (1654) Romulus and Remus, the legendary twin founders of the city of Rome, were said to have been born to a Vestal Virgin, Rhea Silvia. Rhea Silvia had been forced to become a Vestal Virgin against her will and claimed to have been impregnated through divine intervention. Livy attests that she was instead raped by an unknown man. In any case King Amulius ordered the twins to be drowned as death through the elements would not trigger divine punishment. Historical figures Alexander, the Ptolemies, and the Caesars were said by some scholars to have been \\"virgin-born.\\" Alexander the Great, \\" journeyed to the Oasis of Amon in order that he might be recognized as the god‚Äôs son and thus become a legitimate and recognized king of Egypt. Inscriptions show that he and the Ptolemies after him had the incidents of their birth regularly depicted in temple reliefs.‚ÄùBreasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, Vol. 2, p. 77. (As cited by Boslooper) Norden calls this the Hellenistic virgin motif. However, evidence shows that Alexander must have had a double tradition of origin. It is recorded that \\"Alexander the Great and Augustus are deemed to have been conceived of a serpent god, and they claimed between them Phoebus and Jupiter as their progenitors.\\"Sidonius Apollinaris, Carmina II, 121, Testimonies 289 in Asclepius, E. J. and Ludwig Edelstein (1945) ‚ÄúThe Emperor Augustus was praised as the Savior of the world ‚Ä¶[but] the idea of Savior was not unique or original with Augustus himself. Before him the same title was given to Seleucid and other Hellenistic kings. Throughout this period there were frequent longings for a savior from the present troubles.‚Äù Augustus was said to have had a miraculous birth and a childhood filled with many portents and signs. A few months before he was born a portent was observed at Rome which gave warning that nature was pregnant with a king for the Roman People. \\"Thereupon the Senate in consternation decreed that no male child born that year should be reared; but those whose wives were with child saw to it that the decree was not filed in the treasury, since each one appropriated the prediction to his own family.\\" Boslooper relates several additional stories. In one, Suetonius narrates what he learned from Asclepias of Mendes: > \\"When Atia had come in the middle of the night to the solemn service of > Apollo, she had her litter set down in the temple and fell asleep, while the > rest of the matrons also slept. On a sudden a serpent glided up to her and > shortly went away. When she awoke, she purified herself, as if after the > embraces of her husband, and at once there appeared on her body a mark in > colors like a serpent, and she could never get rid of it; so that presently > she ceased ever to go to the public baths. In the tenth month after that > Augustus was born and was therefore regarded as the son of Apollo. Atia too, > before she gave him birth, dreamed that her vitals were borne up to the > stars and spread over the whole extent of land and sea, while Octavius > dreamed that the sun rose from Atia's womb.\\" (p. 180) The hope for a savior was expressed in Virgil‚Äôs ‚ÄúFourth Eclogue\\". The Church fathers later claimed this was a reference to Jesus Christ, however, the poem was dedicated to Pollio, one of the great influential men at the time of the civil wars and Virgil's patron and friend. The hero of the poem is a child born or to be born in 40 B.C., at the time of Pollio's consulate. A new era was expected, in fulfillment of an older oracle. > \\"... Now the last age by Cumae's Sibyl sung Has come and gone, and the > majestic roll Of circling centuries begins anew: Justice returns, returns > old Saturn's reign, With a new breed of men sent down from heaven. Only do > thou, at the boy's birth in whom The iron shall cease, the golden race > arise, Befriend him, chaste Lucina; 'tis thine own Apollo reigns ... \\"For > thee, O boy, First shall the earth, untilled, pour freely forth Her childish > gifts, the gadding ivy-spray With foxglove and Egyptian bean-flower mixed, > And laughing-eyed acanthus. Of themselves, Untended, will the she-goats then > bring home Their udders swollen with milk, while flocks afield Shall of the > monstrous lion have no fear...\\" Hinduism In the story of Krishna the deity is the agent of conception and also the offspring. Because of his sympathy for the earth, the divine Vishnu himself descended into the womb of Devaki and was born as her son, Krishna. The Hindu Vishnu Purana relates: \\"Devaki bore in her womb the lotus-eyed deity...before the birth of Krishna, no one ‚Äúcould bear to gaze upon Devaki, from the light that invested her, and those who contemplated her radiance felt their minds disturbed.‚Äù This reference to light is reminiscent of the Vedic hymn \\"To an Unknown God,\\" which refers to a Golden Child. According to F. M. M√ºller this term means \\"the golden germ of child\\" and is an attempt at naming the sun. This is occasionally brought up as evidence for the hypothesis that \\"virgin birth\\" tales are a fairly common phenomenon in non-Christian religions around the world.Christopher Hitchens, God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything (Paperback), 2007, p. 23Chapman Cohen, Essays in Freethinking, 1927, \\"Monism and Religion\\" However, there is nothing in Hindu scriptures to suggest that it was a \\"virgin\\" birth. By the time of conception and birth of Krishna, Devaki was married to Vasudeva and had already borne seven children. In the Ramayana, Vishnu incarnates himself as a man, Rama, in the womb of Kausalya, one of the wives of the king Dasharatha. In the Mahabharata epic, Surya, the god of the sun, impregnates Queen Kunti before her marriage to King Pandu, causing her to give birth to their son Karna. Surya restores her virginity afterwards, thereby allowing her to marry Pandu, despite having already given birth. Also in the Mahabharata, Bharadwaja ≈ôshi goes with his companions to the Ganga River to perform his ablutions. There, he spots a beautiful apsara named Ghritachi, who has come to bathe. The sage is overcome by desire, causing him to involuntarily ejaculate out of excitement. Bharadwaja Muni captures the semen in a vessel called a ƒêro≈Üa, and ƒêro≈ÜƒÅcharya himself springs forth from it. However, some Hindus believe that when the emanations of the Supreme Being are pratyaksha, or obvious to the sight, they become sacara, or embodied. Krishna was such an embodiment and usually bore a human form. In that mode of appearance the deities are generally supposed to be born of a woman, but without any carnal intercourse. This belief is not adhered to by those who follow the Purva Mimansa, or the philosophy of Jaimini. They insist that the Devas were mere mortals whom the Supreme Being endowed with qualities similar to his own. In general, the Hindus perform acts of worship to some of their ancient monarchs and sages, who were deified on account of their eminent virtues.Wilford, On Egypt and the Nile, Asiatic Researches, Vol. III p. 374 Buddhism MƒÅyƒÅ miraculously giving birth to SiddhƒÅrtha. Sanskrit, palm-leaf manuscript. NƒÅlandƒÅ, Bihar, India. PƒÅla period The stories of Buddha‚Äôs unusual birth developed through the centuries. Two accounts cited by Boslooper tell of the descent of the future Bodhisattva from the \\"Tusita Body\\" into the mother‚Äôs womb, the appearance of the Buddha in the mother as a shining gem, and the accompanying wonders in the natural world. These are the Majjhima-NikƒÅya, 123 Acchariyabbhutadhammasuta III. 119-124; (I. B. Horner, 1959, pp. 164‚Äì169); and MƒÅhapadƒÅnasutta, Dƒ´gha ii. 12.Davids, T. W. Rhys, Dialogues of the Buddha, Part II, Sacred Books of the Buddhists, Vol. III (1910), p. 8 In the Mahapadana-sutra, Digha ii. 12, is the description of the incarnation of the Vipassƒ´ Buddha. > \\"Now Vipassi, brethren, when, as Bodhisat, he ceased to belong to the hosts > of the heaven of Delight, descended into his mother‚Äôs womb mindful and self- > possessed.\\" According to this text, the Vipassƒ´ Buddha was the first of six incarnations to precede Gautama. The others listed are Sikhƒ´, Vessabh≈´, Kakusandha, Ko·πáƒÅgamana, and Kassapa. The most popular legendary account of the birth of Buddha is in the Nidanakatha Jataka (see, Jataka tales) which accounted for the lives of Buddha in previous incarnations. In this account, the ‚ÄúGreat Being‚Äù chose the time and place of his birth, the tribe into which he would be born, and who his mother would be. In the time chosen by him, Maya, his mother, fell asleep and dreamed that four archangels carried her to the Himalayan Mountains where their queens bathed and dressed her. In her dream the Great Being soon entered her womb from her side, in the form of a white elephant. When she woke, she told her dream to the Raja, who summoned sixty- four eminent Brahmans to interpret it. \\"Then is described how at his birth he took seven great steps and at the seventh he shouted, 'I am the chief of the world,' how he at birth held in his hand some medicine that became for him the drug by which he later healed the sick and blind and deaf, how at birth he wished to give a gift but was presented one himself by his mother, and how lastly he sang the song of victory.' China=Yellow Emperor The Yellow Emperor is sometimes said to have been the fruit of extraordinary birth, as his mother Fubao conceived him as she was aroused, while walking in the country, by a lightning bolt from the Big Dipper.Yves Bonnefoy, Asian Mythologies. University of Chicago Press, 1993. . p. 246 The Abandoned One Qi, the Abandoned One, who later became known as Houji a culture hero or god of agriculture was held in some accounts to have been miraculously conceived when his mother, the consort Jiang Yuan, stepped into a footprint left by the supreme god Shangdi.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. \\"Hou Ji\\". Laozi Some Taoist schools held that Laozi was conceived when his mother gazed upon a falling star. He was born while his mother was leaning against a plum tree. Laozi was said to have emerged as an old man with a full grey beard. This may be because his name \\"Old Master\\" () can also be read as \\"Old Child\\".Morgan Diane, The Best Guide to Eastern Philosophy and Religion, New York, St. Martin's Griffin, 2001 Abaoji There are some legends about the birth of Abaoji (also known as Yi), the Emperor Taizu of Liao. According to the legends, his mother dreamed that the sun fell from the sky and into her bosom, from which pregnancy followed. When she gave birth, the room is said to have become filled with a mysterious light and extraordinary fragrance. As a newborn, his body was that of a three-year-old, and the legends go on to say that he was walking at the age of three months.Mote, F.W. (2003), Imperial China:900-1800, Harvard University Press Christianity Mainstream scholars agree that the nativity of Jesus, if not taken as historically accurate, should be interpreted within the context of first-century Judaism, not in the context of foreign mythologies, which contain only remote similarities.James D.G.

Aus, Matthew 1-2 and the Virginal Conception in Light of Palestinian and Hellenistic Judaic Traditions on the Birth of Israel's First Redeemer Moses (Studies in Judaism, Landham: University Press of America, 2004). Mary According to tradition of the Catholic church, the Virgin Mary's parents, St. Anne and St. Joachim, were childless, when an angel came to them and told them they would give birth to a daughter. During the conception of Mary, she was preserved from the stain of original sin. Jesus Romanian icon of the Nativity. The Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of Matthew describe the nativity of Jesus. In the account in the Gospel of Luke, Mary learns from the angel Gabriel that she will conceive and bear a child. She asks \\"How this can be, since I am a virgin?\\". He tells her \\"The Holy Spirit will come upon you ‚Ä¶ nothing is impossible with God.‚Äô She responds: \\"Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word\\".. At the time that Mary is due to give birth, she and her husband Joseph travel from their home in Nazareth to Joseph's ancestral home in Bethlehem to register in the Census of Quirinius. Finding no place for themselves in the inn, Mary gives birth to Jesus and she places him in a manger (feeding trough).. An angel of the Lord visits the shepherds guarding their flocks in nearby fields and brings them \\"good news of great joy\\": \\"to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is the Messiah, the Lord.\\" The angel tells them they will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger. In the Gospel of Matthew, the impending birth is announced to Joseph in a dream, in which he is instructed to name the child Jesus.. A star reveals the birth of Jesus to a number (traditionally three) of magi, Greek ŒºŒ¨Œ≥ŒøœÇ, commonly translated as \\"wise man\\" but in this context probably meaning \\"astronomer\\" or \\"astrologer\\", who travel to Jerusalem from an unspecified country \\"in the east\\".. After the 1st century, traditions flourished that represented the thinking of that time, and also preserved source material for many of the ideas in the \\"theological writings of the church fathers.\\" In their present form the pseudepigraphal writings contained in the Sibylline Oracles include literature written from the 2nd century BC through the 6th century of the Christian era. They contain some material relevant to the birth and infancy of Jesus. But this passage in the Oracles, Book III, probably represents the hopes of pre-Christian Alexandrian Jews. > \\"Be of good cheer, O maiden, and exult; for the Eternal, who made heaven and > earth, has given thee joy, and he will dwell in thee, and for thee shall be > an immortal light. And wolves and lambs promiscuously shall eat grass in the > mountains, and among the kids shall leopards graze, And wandering bears > shall lodge among the calves, and the carnivorous lion shall eat straw in > the manger like the ox, and little children lead them with a band. For tame > will be on earth the beasts he made, And with young babes will dragons fall > asleep, and no harm, for God‚Äôs hand will be on them.\\"Terry, Milton Spenser, > Aloisius Rzach, The Sibylline Oracles, Eaton & Mains, Cincinnati:: Curtis & > Jennings, 1899 (page 93, lines 975-984). Later, the church fathers refer to subsequent books in the Oracles that are clear allusions to Christ, and probably dated from the close of the second or beginning of the 3rd century AD. The first Christian theologians demonstrated in their writings their knowledge of such non-canonical sources. The non- canonical gospels contain much that is pertinent. The apocryphal literature departs from the Christian canon and its legends have many elements similar to pagan stories representing popular beliefs of the church from the second Christian century on through the Middle Ages. Islam Persian Shi'a miniature. Jesus in Islam The Quran and other Islamic literature contain reports of a number of miraculous births of biblical characters. The Quran describes virginal conception of Jesus by Mary (Arabic: Maryam), which is recounted throughout several passages in the Quran. The narrative goes that Mary was visited by the angel Gabriel that she will give birth to a holy son, named Isa' (Jesus), the Messiah and that he will be a great prophet, to whom God will give the Injil (Gospel) and he will speak in infancy and maturity and will be a companion to the most righteous. When this news was given to Mary, she asked the angel how she can have a baby as she was a virgin.Qur'an, Chapter 3, Verse 43 To this, the angel replied \\"Even though when God wants to create a matter, he merely wills (Kun-fa-yakun) it and the things come into being\\".Qur'an, Chapter 3, verse 47. After giving birth, while resting near the trunk of a palm tree Jesus spoke to Mary from the cradle instructing her to shake the tree and obtain its fruits. After showing Jesus as a newborn to her family Jesus again spoke \\"Lo, I am God's servant; God has given me the Book, and made me a Prophet. Blessed he has made me, wherever I may be; and He has enjoined me to pray, and to give alms, so long as I live and likewise to cherish my mother\\" in order to dispel rumours of conception.\\"Isa\\", Encyclopedia of Islam This birth narrative draws strong parallels to the apocryphal tradition of Jesus' birth within the Infancy Gospel of Thomas and Arabic Infancy Gospel. Kabir In 1440, the poet Kabir was also said to have been born of a virgin widow (a Hindu), through the palm of her hand. Like Karna, Kabir was sent down the river in a basket; he was found and adopted by a family of Muslim weavers, downstream. Other traditions=Aztec mythologyHuitzilopochtli= The myth of Huitzilopochtli is uniquely Aztec. Huitzilopochtli is therefore considered to be the cult god or the patron god of the Aztec. As a solar deity, Huitzilopochtli is closely related to and overlaps with Tonatiuh. Huitzilopochtli‚Äôs mother was Coatlicue, or She of the Serpent Skirt. Coatlicue, known for her devout nature and virtuous qualities, was at Mount Coatepec or Coatepetl (\\"Serpent Hill\\"; near Tula, Hidalgo) one day, sweeping and tending to her penance, when she discovered a bundle of feathers on the ground. She decided to save them and placed them in her bosom. Without her realizing, the feathers impregnated her. =Quetzalcoatl= There are several stories about the birth of Quetzalcoatl. In the first story, Quetzalcoatl was born by a virgin named Chimalman, to whom the god Ometeotl appeared in a dream.J. B. Bierlein, Living Myths. How Myth Gives Meaning to Human Experience, Ballantine Books, 1999 In another story, the virgin Chimalman conceived Quetzalcoatl by swallowing an emerald.David Carrasco, Quetzalcoatl and the Irony of Empire, The University of Chicago Press, 1982 A third story narrates that Chimalman was hit in the womb by an arrow bolted by Mixcoatl and nine months later she gave birth to Quetzalcoatl.J. F. Bierlein, 1999 A fourth story narrates that Quetzalcoatl was born from Coatlicue, who already had four hundred children who formed the stars of the Milky Way.J. F. Bierlein 1999 Mongolian mythology According to a legend narrated by The Secret History of the Mongols, a Mongol woman named Alan Gua had a son, named Bodonchar, some years after her husband has died. She claimed a radiant yellow person visited her at night and impregnated her. She believed the visitor was the god Tengri. Bodonchar became the founder of the Borjigin tribe and a direct ancestor of Genghis Khan.Lococo Paul, Genghis Khan: History's Greatest Empire Builder, Potomac Books, 2008 Japanese mythology Miraculous births are common in Japanese folklore, and include Momotar≈ç the Peach Boy (who was found inside a giant peach floating on a river), Kintar≈ç (about whom several origin myths are told), and Kaguya-hime (who was born inside the stalk of a glowing bamboo plant). Native American mythology The Great Peacemaker, sometimes referred to as Deganawida or Dekanawida (Iroquois) was born a Huron, and by some accounts, his mother was a virgin, so the birth was miraculous.

Lula is known as one of the most successful Brazilian football managers. Career Born in Santos, S√£o Paulo, Lula worked as a taxicab, a baker and a milkman. He started to work as a manager with amateur clubs in his hometown, Palmeirinha and Americana. He subsequently joined Portuguesa Santista, in charge of the club's youth setup. In January 1949, Lula signed his first contract with Santos FC, being the subdirector of the club's amateur sides. On 13 May 1952, he was named in charge of the club's youth teams. Lula acted as an interim manager for two matches in 1952, as Aymor√© Moreira was in charge of the S√£o Paulo official team. He later became Moreira's assistant while was also in charge of the club's amateur sides, and on 2 June 1954, he replaced Italian Giuseppe Ottina as the first team manager. Lula's first match in charge occurred three days later, a 3‚Äì2 win against Botafogo at the Maracan√£ Stadium. He led the club to the following year's Campeonato Paulista title, after a 20-year drought. Lula was often described as the responsible for bringing together the team who was known as Os Sant√°sticos; he made Pel√© a regular starter from 1957, promoted Pag√£o and Pepe from the youth setup, brought Coutinho from lowly XV de Piracicaba and approved Dorval on a trial, after the latter was rejected by a number of clubs. In the 1960s, the club signed Calvet, Lima, Meng√°lvio and Zito, all recommended by the manager. Lula left Peixe in the end of the 1966 season; although it is mainly attributed to the club's second place in the Ta√ßa Brasil, some reported altercations with Pel√© are also attributed to the manager's departure. He left the club after being 945 matches in charge, with 619 wins, 144 draws and 182 defeats. In 1967, Lula took over Portuguesa Santista before being appointed manager of Corinthians in November of that year. In charge for only 35 matches with the latter club, he helped the side to defeat former club Santos on 6 March 1968, ending an 11-year hoodoo. Lula later worked for Portuguesa and Santo Andr√© in the early 1970s. Death Lula deceased on 15 June 1972, having a generalized infection due to a kidney transplant, worsened due to his hypertension.

The Final Fantasy VIII Original Soundtrack, a compilation of all music in the game, was released on four Compact Discs by DigiCube in Japan, and by Square EA in North America. A special orchestral arrangement of selected tracks from the game‚Äîarranged by Shir≈ç Hamaguchi‚Äîwas released under the title Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec Final Fantasy VIII, and a collection of piano arrangements‚Äîperformed by Shinko Ogata‚Äîwas released under the title Piano Collections Final Fantasy VIII. The game's soundtrack is best known for two tracks: \\"Liberi Fatali\\", a Latin choral piece that is played during the introduction to the game, and \\"Eyes on Me\\", a pop song serving as the game's theme, performed by Chinese singer Faye Wong. Reviewers were generally pleased with the music, although several cited issues while comparing the score to previous games or looking at individual tracks. Creation and influence Nobuo Uematsu's usual influences include Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Simon and Garfunkel, and Elton John. In regard to Final Fantasy VIII, Uematsu did not prefer to use multiple sources to find MIDI instruments‚Äî\\"I could be coming up with a great melody in the very moment\\"‚Äîinstead using a Roland SC-88 synthesizer for the entire score. Uematsu wrote notes based on character designs and screenplays, creating a general picture of the pieces' moods. He could not express a character's emotions solely with plot, instead using images of appearance and attire‚Äî\\"It's important to know when their emotions are at their height, but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...!\\" In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of Final Fantasy VIII was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated \\"the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's also my intention to put various types of music into one game\\". Uematsu enjoys writing lyrical pieces, but tries not to be genre-specific. He asserts that expressing the emotions he desires is more important than improving skills: \\"I think it will be a shame if we won't be able to cry as we play our own game\\". The absence of character themes was due to him finding those of Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII ineffective. Uematsu considers it reasonable to have character themes if each character has a \\"highlight\\" in the game, but he found Final Fantasy VIII only focused on Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartilly as a couple, resulting in the \\"Eyes on Me\\" theme. The soundtrack features a Latin choral track \\"Liberi Fatali\\", which translates to \\"Fated Children\\"; its melody forms a musical theme heard in several other pieces in the soundtrack, such as \\"SeeD\\" and \\"The Landing\\", while the name of \\"Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec\\" is the recurring lyrics in \\"Liberi Fatali\\". Near the end of the production of Final Fantasy VII, the developers suggested to use a singer, but abandoned the idea due to a lack of reasoning based on the game's theme and storyline. However, Nobuo Uematsu thought a ballad would closely relate to the theme and characters of Final Fantasy VIII. This resulted in the game's developers sharing \\"countless\\" artists, eventually deciding on Faye Wong, a Chinese vocalist. Uematsu claims \\"her voice and mood seem to match my image of the song exactly\\", and that her ethnicity \\"fits the international image of Final Fantasy\\". After negotiations were made, \\"Eyes on Me\\" was recorded in Hong Kong with an orchestra. Albums=Final Fantasy VIII Original Soundtrack Final Fantasy VIII Original Soundtrack is a soundtrack of the music from Final Fantasy VIII; composed and produced by Nobuo Uematsu. The soundtrack spans four discs and 74 tracks, covering a duration of 4 hours and 9 minutes. It was first published by DigiCube on March 10, 1999 with the catalog number SSCX-10028, and subsequently published by Square Enix on May 10, 2004 with the catalog numbers SQEX-10005~8. Unlike most other Final Fantasy soundtracks, Final Fantasy VIII Original Soundtrack is composed completely of English track names. The album was also released in North America under the title Final Fantasy VIII Music Collection: Music From The Final Fantasy VIII Video Game. It features changes such as packaging design, translation, and additional images. In addition, a limited edition was produced, which has a beige background instead of a full motion video montage. The soundtrack reached #4 on the Japan Oricon charts, selling over 300,000 copies. It received generally positive reviews from critics; New Zealand PlayStation magazine claimed Final Fantasy VIII has \\"one of the most memorable scores you will ever hear\\". Reviewers from multimedia news website IGN stated that much of the game's impact is owed to its \\"terrific\\" musical score, but were disappointed by \\"yet another\\" variation of the traditional battle theme. IGN later named the Final Fantasy VIII soundtrack as fourth best in its Final Fantasy Soundtrack Countdown feature. GameSpot considered the game's sound its weakest point, but still commended it, claiming it has \\"more 'quality' songs than Final Fantasy VII\\". Lastly, Game Revolution stated that \\"there are only a few tracks that really stand out\\", including \\"Eyes on Me\\", which it deemed a \\"clich√©d, but beautiful love song\\". Final Fantasy VIII Original Soundtrack has sold \\"more than 300,000 copies\\" in Japan according to Square, or 259,000 physical copies according to the independent chart company Oricon. Adam Corn of SoundtrackCentral.com claimed the album shows similarities to previous Final Fantasy games, but asserted he was \\"not overly impressed with this one\\". A reviewer from Square Enix Music Online claimed the soundtrack is \\"unique and very special\\" due to its contrasts‚Äî\\"When signs of age of the Final Fantasy franchise are shown\\", Uematsu counterbalances this by creating something \\"weird and wonderful[...] when the soundtrack becomes too serious, a light- hearted number is inserted to liven up the mood\\". Ben Schweitzer of RPGFan said in his review of the album that \\"the main flavor of Uematsu's compositions, his melodic style, remains consistent, and more importantly, consistently good\\". He criticized, however, the more minimalist pieces, which in his opinion were bland. Track listing Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec Final Fantasy VIII Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec Final Fantasy VIII is a collection of orchestrated pieces originally from Final Fantasy VIII, arranged by Shir≈ç Hamaguchi. It also includes three unchanged tracks from Final Fantasy VIII Original Soundtrack; \\"Liberi Fatali\\", \\"Eyes on Me\\", and \\"Ending Theme\\". The album spans 13 tracks, totaling 1:04:12. It was first published on November 19, 1999 by DigiCube with the catalog number SSCX-10037, and subsequently published on July 22, 2004 by Square Enix with the catalog number SQEX-10025. The album reached #59 on the Japan Oricon charts, selling 7,540 copies. Adam Corn of SoundtrackCentral.com claimed \\"the superior instrumental quality, well-done arrangements, and tasteful selection of themes boost the [Original Soundtracks] qualities while hiding its flaws\\", elaborating that \\"even people such as myself who are not fans of the original will be impressed by its prowess, and fans will simply be enamored\\". Neal Chandran of RPGFan was similarly impressed, saying that it was \\"a very good soundtrack\\" and that its tracks sounded \\"more beautiful than the original version\\". His primary complaint was that he would have liked for the album to include more pieces. Piano Collections Final Fantasy VIII Piano Collections Final Fantasy VIII is an album of piano arrangements from Final Fantasy VIII, arranged by Shir≈ç Hamaguchi and performed by Shinko Ogata. Its 13 tracks span a duration of 48:03. It was published by DigiCube on January 21, 2000 with the catalog number SSCX-10041 and subsequently re-published by Square Enix on July 22, 2004 with the catalog number SQEX-10026. Robert Steen of SoundtrackCentral.com commended the performance, claiming \\"Shinko Ogata seems to be a very capable player\\" and noted that although the arrangements are similar to the original pieces, they \\"breathe new life into the songs\\". Ryan Bradley of RPGFan also appreciated the album, saying that \\"the piano really brings out the emotion in some of the songs\\" and that the pieces transitioned smoothly to piano. Patrick Gann agreed, saying that it was one of his favorite albums and that Hamaguchi's arrangements were \\"wonderful\\". Eyes on Me \\"Eyes on Me\\" is the ballad that serves as the theme of the game Final Fantasy VIII. It was performed by Chinese singer Faye Wong and composed, like the rest of the game music, by Nobuo Uematsu. The song's lyrics, written in somewhat imperfect English by Kako Someya, unveil the hopes of a night club singer for romance with a member of her audience. It was released as a CD single in Japan, including an instrumental version and Wong's ballad \\"Red Bean\\". The song sold more than 500,000 copies, placing it as the highest-selling video game music disc ever released in that country at the time. \\"Eyes on Me\\" was the first song in video game history to win an award at the 14th Annual Japan Gold Disc Awards, where it won \\"Song of the Year (Western Music)\\" in 1999. The single reached #9 on the Oricon charts, and stayed on the charts for 20 weeks. Within the game, the song is written by Julia Heartilly, a pianist who is the love interest of Laguna Loire. It is heard repeatedly throughout the game in various incarnations, including as an instrumental piece entitled Julia, as well as in \\"Waltz for the Moon\\" and \\"Love Grows\\" for the \\"love\\" scenes between Squall Leonheart and Rinoa Heartlily. A dance remix of the song was included on the Japanese release of Wong's 2000 album Fable. Remixes also appeared in Toshiba EMI's Dancemania series. In 2004, a Japanese-language version entitled with lyrics by Kazushige Nojima was included on Final Fantasy Song Book: Mahoroba. It was covered by Angela Aki for release on her 2006 single \\"Kokoro no Senshi\\". Legacy The music of Final Fantasy VIII has appeared in various official Final Fantasy concerts. These include 2002's 20020220 Music from FINAL FANTASY, in which the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra played \\"Liberi Fatali\\", \\"Don't Be Afraid\\", \\"Love Grows\\", and \\"The Man with the Machine Gun\\", the 2004 Tour de Japon series, which featured \\"The Oath\\", the Dear Friends series that began that same year and included \\"Liberi Fatali\\" and \\"Love Grows\\", and the 2005 More Friends concert, which included \\"Maybe I'm a Lion\\". More recent concerts include the Voices - Music from Final Fantasy 2006 concert showcasing \\"Liberi Fatali\\", \\"Fisherman's Horizon\\", and \\"Eyes on Me\\" and the international Distant Worlds concert tour that continues to date, which includes \\"Liberi Fatali\\", \\"Fisherman's Horizon\\", \\"Man with the Machine Gun\\", and \\"Love Grows\\". Several of these concerts have produced live albums as well. Music from the game has also been played in non Final Fantasy-specific concerts such as the Play! A Video Game Symphony world tour from 2006 onwards, for which Nobuo Uematsu composed the opening fanfare that accompanies each performance. \\"Eyes on Me\\" was played at the Fantasy Comes Alive concert in Singapore on April 30, 2010. Music from the original soundtrack has been arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing. All of the pieces in the book have been rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate-level piano solos, though they are meant to sound as much like the originals as possible. \\"Best of\\" collections from the series including Final Fantasy VIII and arrangements for guitar solos and piano duets are also available. Additionally, the actual piano sheet music from the Piano Collections Final Fantasy VIII album has been published as a corresponding music book by Yamaha Music Media. The book contains the original music, exactly as arranged and performed on the albums. Unlike the Original Score arrangements, these pieces are intended only for advanced players as they are generally more difficult. The Black Mages, a band that arranges music from Final Fantasy video games into a rock music style, has arranged five pieces from Final Fantasy VIII. These are \\"Force Your Way\\" from The Black Mages, published in 2003, \\"The Man with the Machine Gun\\" and \\"Maybe I'm a Lion\\", from The Black Mages II: The Skies Above, published in 2004, and \\"The Extreme\\" and \\"Premonition\\" from The Black Mages III: Darkness and Starlight. The Black Mages performed \\"Maybe I'm a Lion\\" at the Extra: Hyper Game Music Event 2007 concert in Tokyo on July 7, 2007. In the 2004 Summer Olympics, the American synchronized swimming duo consisting of Alison Bartosik and Anna Kozlova were awarded the bronze medal for their performance to the pieces \\"Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec\\" and \\"Liberi Fatali\\".

Synopsis Britt Reid, publisher of The Sentinel newspaper, is secretly the vigilante crime fighter the Green Hornet. He and his Korean valet Kato investigate and expose several seemingly separate criminal rackets. This leads them into continued conflict with \\"the Chief,\\" the mastermind behind the criminal syndicate controlling those rackets. Cast * Gordon Jones as Britt Reid and The Green Hornet * Wade Boteler as Michael Axford *Keye Luke as Kato is Korean in the serial rather than being the original Japanese character of the radio series, due to rising anti-Japanese sentiment around the world. This was two years prior to Japan's December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States' entry into World War II. The radio show dropped Kato's nationality from the introductory sequence, included passing references in dialogue to his character being Filipino, and years later, after the war, returned to the standard show introduction. * Anne Nagel as Leonore Case * Phillip Trent as Jasper Jenks * Cy Kendall as Curtis Monroe * Stanley Andrews as Police Commissioner [Chs.1,5,8,9,13] * Selmer Jackson as District Attorney [Chs.4,10] * Joseph Crehan as Judge Stanton [Chs.1,9,10,13] * Walter McGrail as Dean * Gene Rizzi as Corey * John Kelly as Pete Hawks * Eddie Dunn as D.H.

Influence The 1960s Batman television series was created because of the popularity of a re-release of Columbia's Batman serial. The success of both led to the production of a Green Hornet TV series, which was played as a straight action crime series, \\"in the tradition of its former presentations\\", rather than the campy Batman series.

It forms a large glaciated massif, about 15 km wide, extending between the Rawil Pass and the Gemmi Pass. Along with the Muverans, the Diablerets and the Wildhorn, the Wildstrubel is one the four distinct mountain massifs of the Bernese Alps that lie west of the Gemmi Pass. The massif of the Wildstrubel is at the centre between the valleys of Simmental (BE), Engstligental (BE) and the Rhone (VS), the exact location of the tripoint being the summit of the Schneehorn.Although the main summit of the Wildstrubel lies on the Bern-Valais border, it is north of the Rhine-Rhone watershed. It comprises several distinct summits, including (from west to east) the Wetzsteinhorn, the Rohrbachstein, the Weisshorn, the Pointe de la Plaine Morte, Mont Bonvin, the Trubelstock and the Schneehorn. The main crest with the almost equally high summits of the Mittelgipfel (3,243.5 m) and the Grossstrubel (3,243 m) forms an amphitheatre oriented eastward which ends at the Steghorn and the Daubenhorn. This area encloses the Wildstrubel Glacier. To the southwest, the Wildstrubel overlooks the high plateau of the Plaine Morte Glacier, which also includes an unnamed lake below the Schneehorn. The Grossstrubel (left) and the Mittelgipfel (right) from Engstligenalp The Wildstrubel from the Plaine Morte Glacier The Wildstrubel lies approximately halfway between Lenk (BE; 9 km), Sierre (VS; 12 km) and Adelboden (BE; 10 km), its summit being in the municipalities of Lenk and Leukerbad. The nearest settlement is the Oberried section of Lenk, at the head of the Simmental. Other notable towns and resorts around the massif are Crans-Montana, Aminona, Leukerbad and Inden. The highest place that can be reached without effort is the Pointe de la Plaine Morte station (2,882 m), which is connected to Cran- Montana and within 5 km from the summit. As for the other mountains on the crest of the Bernese Alps, the slopes of the Wildstrubel experience different types of climate depending on their location:This results in different colors of the vegetation, which can be seen on satellite images such as those available on Google Earth (2015 imagery) the northern slopes are cooler and wetter while the southern slopes are drier and warmer. Forests are found up to 1,900 metres on the north side and up to 2,100 metres on the south side. Glaciers also reach lower locations on the north side. Vineyards are also very common on the Valais side, especially below 1000 metres, but completely absent on the Bernese side, where alpine pastures dominate the landscape, as in many other areas of the Bernese Oberland. Although not a technical climb, the ascent of the Wildstrubel involves either long ascents or glacier crossings. The shortest access is from the Pointe de la Plaine Morte station, but before the 500 metre-scramble to the top, nearly all the Plaine Morte Glacier must be crossed. Another access is from the Gemmi Pass (aerial tramway from Leukerbad), via the L√§mmeren Hut (SAC), from where the ascent is made on the slopes of the much more crevassed Wildstrubel Glacier. The only glacier-free path is from Lenk, but it is also the longest ascent as the end of the paved road lies at 1,105 metres, or 2,139 metres below the summit. The mountain has three summits, all of similar height and located on the cantonal border, although within the Rhine basin. These three summits, strung out along a 3.5-km ridge, make a convenient traverse. *The western summit (the Lenkerstrubel, named Wildstrubel on Swiss maps) (3,244 or 3,243.5 m) *The central summit (named Mittelgipfel on Swiss maps) (3,243.5 m) *The eastern summit (the Adelbodnerstrubel or Grossstrubel) (3,242.6 m) The third or fourth recorded ascent was by Leslie Stephen and Thomas W.

His execution at a young age was viewed as extremely unjust by most Sri Lankans, hastening the movement toward independence and providing motivation and a martyr for those who pioneered the movement.  Early life  Henry Pedris was born in Galle, Ceylon, the youngest of five children and the only son of Duenuge Disan Pedris and Mallino Fernando Pedris, daughter of Peace Officer Margris Fernando of Karandeniya.Peace Officer Margris Fernando of Karandeniya Both his father and uncle N. S. Fernando Wijesekara were leading businessmen of the time, and his family was among the wealthiest and most influential in Sri Lanka. Pedris first attended Royal College situated in the Pettah. From there he joined St. Thomas' College where he excelled in sports and shone as a good cricketer, playing for the school's first eleven cricket team. After some time he returned to Royal College where he again played cricket and engaged in other sporting activities. Pedris was a teetotaler and his father had great hopes that Pedris would one day take over his business enterprises and become a leader in the commercial sector. Colombo Town Guard With the outbreak of World War I the British mobilized the Ceylon Defence Force and raised the Colombo Town Guard a regiment of volunteers to defend Colombo if attacked. Pedris opted to join the Colombo Town Guard as a private and first Sinhalese to be enlisted to the new regiment. He soon became an excellent marksman and due to his excellent horsemanship was made a commissioned officer in the administrative (mounted) section. Within a year, he was promoted to the rank of Captain. This, along with his immense wealth, resulted Pedris being much envied by many.  Sinhalese Muslim Riots  The Sinhalese Muslim Riots (known as the 1915 riots), which began in Kandy when a group of Muslims attacked a Buddhist pageant with stones, soon spread across the island. The British Governor of Ceylon, Sir Robert Chalmers, feared he might lose control of the colony and, on the advice of Brigadier General Malcolm, came down with a heavy hand on the Sinhalese community. Chalmers declared martial law on 2 June 1915, and ordered the police and the Army to shoot without trial anyone who they deemed a rioter. With the escalation of the violence, looting broke out within Colombo. Pedris, as he was responsible for the defense of the city, successfully managed to disband several rioting groups after peaceful discussions. The jealousy felt towards Pedris and his family by both the British and their Sinhalese henchmen, led by Solomon Dias Bandaranike the Maha Mudaliyar (chief native interpreter and adviser to the Governor), culminated in false charges being drawn up against Pedris which eventually let to his court-martial. The charges were that Pedris shot at a group of Muslims and had incited people to march to the city of Colombo from Peliyagoda. Based on these accusations, he was swiftly arrested. Following his arrest the British, fearing open rebellion, imprisoned more than 80 prominent Sinhalese leaders. Among those imprisoned were D. S. Senanayake, D. R. Wijewardena, Edwin Wijeyeratne, Dr. Cassius Pereira, E. T. De Silva, F. R. Dias Bandaranaike, H. W. Amarasuriya, A. H. Molamure and several others.  Death  Captain Henry Pedris Tomb at Kanatte Cemetery. Soon after his arrest and incarceration he was tried by a military court on 1 July 1915. Pedris was tried by three military officials, declared guilty, and branded a traitor. His sentence was death by firing squad. The date of the execution was set for 7 July 1915 without any form of appeal. Chalmers passed on the decision to confirm the death sentence to Brigadier General Malcolm. The only person who was able to intervene in this case was Sir Hector Van Cuylenberg, who was the elected representative in the legislature, but his representations were not taken seriously by the military. Many prominent citizens and educationists, both British and Ceylonese alike, appealed against the judgment without any impact. An appeal was made to King George V. On 7 July 1915, Pedris was stripped of his rank and executed by firing squad. His body was buried in an unmarked grave, in keeping with military tradition but against the wishes of his family. However, D. D. Pedris had people spy on the transport and burial of the body, and the British had actually chosen a cemetery where the Pedris family owned several plots. One of those plots was chosen for the interment, and only one or two members of the Pedris family knew the exact location. In 1987, Pedris‚Äôs grave was unearthed, and the remains were verified as his and reburied with military honors. A Court inquiry that followed, found Pedris not guilty and he and his family were cleared. Legacy Pedris‚Äôs death was also meant as a warning for other Ceylonese leaders who were leading the Independence struggle. After the execution the blood-soaked chair Pedris was sitting on during the execution was taken to the prison cells that contained many Sinhalese leaders including D. S. Senanayake and shown to them with the warning that they would be next. Many claim the execution of Pedris and the actions of the British, marked the beginning of the independence movement with many people specially from the educated middle class taking an active role in it. Their action resulted in Ceylon gaining independence in 1948. Governor Chalmers was removed from the post and made Under-Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland Lord Wimborne. The powers of the Mudaliyars were abolished when the Native Department was closed down in 1938. In 1916, D. D. Pedris built the Isipathanaramaya Temple in Havelock Town, Colombo in memory of his late son. Two statues of Pedris have been erected in Havelock Town and in his hometown Galle. The statue in Havelock was commissioned to the well- known sculptor Henry Dharmasena of Panadura. On the occasion of unveiling ceremony of the statue in Havelock Town, then Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa stated that the adjacent sports grounds should be renamed in his memory. On 7 July 1987 the Edward Henry Pedris Stadium was declared open by Prime Minister Premadasa. D. D. Pedris built a pilgrims' rest in Polonnaruwa and named it the \\"Edward Henry Pedris Rest\\" which was maintained from income gained from lands owned by Pedris in Anuradhapura known as the Kuttampokunakele and the Basuwakkulamakele. Pedris's mother, Mallino Pedris gifted the land for the Mallikarama Temple in Dematagoda in 1920 in her son's memory.

History  Mars climate simulation models date as far back as the Viking missions to Mars. Most Mars climate simulation models were written by individual researchers that were never reused or open-sourced. By the 1990s the need for a unified model codebase came into being, due to the general impact of the internet on climate modelling and research. This current Mars climate simulation model has its origins with the internet era.  How it works  This Mars climate model is a complex 3-dimensional (height, latitude, longitude) model, which represents the processes of atmospheric heating by gases and ground-air heat transfer, as well as large-scale atmospheric motions. The current model has not been modified for use with distributed computing systems like BOINC.  Methane on Mars  The source of Mars methane is unknown; its detection is shown here. Curiosity rover detected a cyclical seasonal variation in alt= The Martian atmosphere contains 10 nmol/mol methane (CH4). In 2014, NASA reported that the Curiosity rover detected a tenfold increase ('spike') in methane in the atmosphere around it in late 2013 and early 2014. Four measurements taken over two months in this period averaged 7.2 ppb, implying that Mars is episodically producing or releasing methane from an unknown source. Before and after that, readings averaged around one-tenth that level. On 7 June 2018, NASA announced a cyclical seasonal variation in the background level of atmospheric methane. The principal candidates for the origin of Mars' methane include non-biological processes such as water-rock reactions, radiolysis of water, and pyrite formation, all of which produce H2 that could then generate methane and other hydrocarbons via Fischer‚ÄìTropsch synthesis with CO and CO2. It has also been shown that methane could be produced by a process involving water, carbon dioxide, and the mineral olivine, which is known to be common on Mars.

The church is located at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Church Street. As Old First Presbyterian Church it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993, for its distinctive Egyptian Revival architecture. History The congregation began worshiping at this site in 1816. The first structure burned down in 1832, and a second sanctuary was constructed the same year. The third (and present) sanctuary was constructed after a fire in 1848 destroyed the previous structure. The name was changed to \\"Downtown\\" after First Presbyterian moved out of downtown Nashville in 1955. The present sanctuary was designed by William Strickland, who also designed the Tennessee State Capitol, in the Egyptian Revival style. Exterior design elements include Egyptian style lotus columns and a winged sun disk. Interior Egyptian style elements include stained glass windows, woodwork and perspective renderings of Egyptian scenes on the sanctuary walls. The design was commissioned during an era when archaeological reports from Egypt were being reported in western publications. The twin towers of Downtown Presbyterian Church are reminiscent of the twin towers of St. Stephen's Church in Philadelphia, the city that Strickland lived in before he moved to Nashville. Surviving drawings illustrate that he also designed Second Presbyterian Church in Nashville, which was demolished in 1979. Downtown Presbyterian Church is one of the few examples of Egyptian Revival architecture in the United States, and may be the best surviving ecclesiastical example. William Strickland also designed the second Mikveh-Israel Synagogue in Philadelphia in 1825 with Egyptian Revival elements, but it has not survived. Two other churches in the United States with Egyptian architectural themes that have survived are the First Baptist Church of Essex, Connecticut, and the First Presbyterian Church (Sag Harbor), New York, also known as the Whalers' Church. A virtual tour of the current Downtown Presbyterian Church is available on the church's website. Several historic events and persons of note have been associated with this church. When Downtown Presbyterian was still known as First Presbyterian Church, President Andrew Jackson was a member. (\\"General\\" Andrew Jackson was presented with a ceremonial sword on the steps of the original church, after the Battle of New Orleans.) Tennessee Governor James K. Polk was inaugurated in the second sanctuary. The present church building was seized by Federal forces and served as a military hospital during the Civil War. It temporarily became Nashville's Union Hospital No. 8, with 206 beds. The church has continued to be used as a refuge by Nashville's citizens from floods in the 1920s, by soldiers during the Second World War and presently has an active social ministry to the less fortunate.

Modules has been around since the early 1990s and is used at some of the largest computer centers to deploy multiple versions of different software tools to users. The National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) reports that they use Environment Modules to manage nearly all software. Environment Modules is specified as a Baseline Configuration requirement of the DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) Project Baseline Configuration team for participating DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs).  modulefiles  The modules system is based on modulefiles, which specify groups of environment settings that need to be made together. Modulefiles can be installed in a central location for general use, or in a user directory for personal use. Environment Modules modulefiles are written in the Tcl (Tool Command Language) and are interpreted by the modulecmd program via the module user interface. The key advantage of Environment Modules is that it is shell independent and supports all major shells such as bash, ksh, zsh, sh, tcsh, and csh. The second key advantage is that it allows to use multiple versions of the program or package from the same account by just loading proper module. Those two advantages were instrumental in making Environment Modules a part of most HPC cluster setups. It also inspired several alternative implementation such as lmod from University of Texas, which is written in Lua instead of TCL. modulefiles are created on per application per version basis. They can be dynamically loaded, unloaded, or switched. Along with the capability of using multiple versions of the same software it also can be used to implement site policies regarding the access and use of applications.  default modulefiles directory  The default modules search path is in a hidden configuration file you can display with: The directory used by some distributions (or any other directory) can be used after a build from source by modifying the file.  Add your own modules to the path  The module essentially performs these steps:  Use a version file within a hierarchical organization  The commands in this section require read/write/execute access to the /etc/modulefiles directory. The $HOME/privatemodules or another directory can be used instead along with \\"module use --append\\" or modification of the configuration file specifying the default modules search path. The default modulefiles directory is empty initially. Copy the null module to the default modulefiles directory to have it shown by \\"module avail\\". The following uses the null and module-info modules to show use of a version file within a hierarchical organization and their effect on module avail and module show: mkdir /etc/modulefiles/test cp \${MODULESHOME}/modulefiles/null /etc/modulefiles/test/2.0 cp \${MODULESHOME}/modulefiles/module-info /etc/modulefiles/test/1.0 module avail module show test Set the first version as the default: echo '#%Module' > /etc/modulefiles/test/.version echo 'set ModulesVersion \\"1.0\\"' >> /etc/modulefiles/test/.version module avail module show test module show test/2.0 Switch to the newer version as the default with: rm /etc/modulefiles/test/.version echo '#%Module' > /etc/modulefiles/test/.version echo 'set ModulesVersion \\"2.0\\"' >> /etc/modulefiles/test/.version module avail module show test After the above following a fresh install from source you would see: $ module avail \\\\ /usr/local/Modules/3.2.10/modulefiles - dot module-git module-info modules null use.own \\\\- /etc/modulefiles - null test/1.0 test/2.0(default) \\\\-- /home/user/privatemodules - null $ module show test \\\\-- /etc/modulefiles/test/2.0: module-whatis does absolutely nothing \\\\-- $ module show test/1.0 \\\\-- /etc/modulefiles/test/1.0: module-whatis returns all various module-info values +++ module-info +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ flags = 2 mode = display name = test/1.0 specified = test/1.0 shell = bash shelltype = sh version = test/1.0 user = advanced trace = 0 tracepat = -.* symbols = *undef* +++ info ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ hostname = localhost level = 1 loaded null = 0 library = /usr/local/lib/tcl8.6 nameofexecutable = sharedlibextension = .so tclversion = 8.6 patchlevel = 8.6.1 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ \\\\--  Automatic modules initialization  Environment Modules on Scientific Linux, CentOS, and RHEL distributions in the environment-modules package include and scripts for the directory that make modules initialization part of the default shell initialization.

It was called the War of the Supremos because of the participation of General Jos√© Mar√≠a Obando and other revolutionary gamonales who called themselves jefes supremos (supreme chiefs). Causes of the war The war began in Pasto, Colombia, after the suppression there of the smaller monasteries. In May 1839 Congress voted to close the monasteries in Pasto and dedicate their income to public education in the province. This was opposed by Ecuador, because the monks there were Ecuadoran. The population of Pasto was devotedly Catholic. On June 30, 1839 the opponents of the closures revolted, raising the banner of federalism in opposition to the unitary central government. The uprising was supported by General Juan Jos√© Flores, president of Ecuador, and by the Catholic Society of Bogot√°, formed a year earlier for the political expression of the most conservative sectors of the country. The opposition Santanderista Party condemned the revolt and offered its services to President M√°rquez to fight it. They wanted M√°rquez to name Jos√© Mar√≠a Obando to pacify Pasto. They hoped that Obando would gain prestige in the fighting that would aid him in the presidential elections scheduled for the following year. Nevertheless, the defense of the government was given principally to Generals Pedro Alc√°ntara Herr√°n and Tom√°s Cipriano de Mosquera, members of the governing party (Partido Ministerial, or Partido de la Casaca Negra). This party was later renamed the Conservative Party of Colombia. Obando, who was friends with the leaders of the revolt but did not support their actions, then went to Bogot√° with the object, it was said, of placing himself under government surveillance to establish his noncomplicity. On August 31, 1839 General Alc√°ntara Herr√°n defeated the rebels from Pasto at Buesaco. Jos√© Eraso, formerly a guerrilla in the service of Obando, was captured. He was famous because Marshal Antonio Jos√© de Sucre spent the night before his assassination in Eraso's house. Eraso was now supporting the government forces, but at the same time he was informing the Pasto guerrillas of their movements. According to the official account, when he was exposed as a double agent he thought that his arrest was for his participation in the assassination of Sucre nine years before. He immediately confessed to that crime. Still according to the official account, Eraso denounced Antonio M. Alv√°rez, military head of the Pasto forces just defeated by Alc√°ntara Herr√°n at Buesaco, and General Jos√© Mar√≠a Obando in the assassination of Sucre. On the basis of Eraso's declaration, a judge in Pasto ordered the arrest of Obando, the most likely candidate of the opposition party in the upcoming presidential elections. Obando left Bogot√° for Pasto, with the declared intention to face the charges against him. Nevertheless, when he arrived at Popay√°n he headed a short rebellion against the government. This was ended after a few days by an agreement with Alc√°ntara Herr√°n, and Obando continued his journey to Pasto. The revolt of Obando and Ecuadoran intervention It is impossible to say whether the charges were cooked up by the government, or whether they were true. Obando decided to escape from Pasto in July 1840 and to enter into open rebellion. Fearing a nationwide revolution, M√°rquez asked Ecuadoran President Juan Jos√© Flores for military aid in suppressing the revolt of Obando. Flores agreed, because he wanted to see Obando punished for the assassination of Sucre (Flores had been implicated in the plot himself), because Alc√°ntara Herr√°n offered the transfer of some Colombian territory to Ecuador, and because Obando by now was calling for the reestablishment of Gran Colombia, including Ecuador, as a federation. Obando also was calling for a revolution in Ecuador against Flores. The combined forces of Alc√°ntara Herr√°n and Flores defeated Obando at Huilquipamba. This was a Pyrrhic victory for the government, however, because the opposition now used the Ecuadoran intervention and the promises made to Ecuador as a call for a general uprising against M√°rquez. They also accused the government of trying to rig the upcoming elections. The conflict becomes national One after another the Santanderista leaders in the provinces revolted: Manuel Gonz√°lez in Socorro, Jos√© Mar√≠a Vezga in Mariquita, Juan Jos√© Reyes Patria in Sogamoso and Tunja, Padre Rafael Mar√≠a V√°squez in V√©lez, Francisco Farf√°n in Casanare, Salvador C√≥rdova in Antioquia, Francisco Carmena in Ci√©naga and Santa Marta, Juan Antonio Guti√©rrez de Pi√±eres in Cartagena, Lorenzo Hern√°ndez in Momp√≥s and Tom√°s Herrera in Panama. The rebel leaders declared their provinces sovereign states separated from Nueva Granada. They assumed the title of jefes supremos (supreme heads) of their provinces. The revolt had now changed from a religious uprising in a single province to a national conflict over federalism. The Supremos swore that they would not return to Nueva Granada until the country was organized as a federation. Of the 20 provinces in the country, 12 were now totally controlled by the rebels, and four others were partially occupied by them. Bogot√° was firmly in government hands, but was largely unguarded because most of the army was engaged in the Pasto conflict. On September 29, 1840, the same day Obando was defeated at Huilquipamba, Reyes Patria and Manuel Gonz√°lez, Supremo of El Socorro, defeated the only regular government troops in the central part of the country at La Polonia, near Socorro. This victory increased the prestige of the revolutionary forces, whose ranks swelled. Gonz√°lez proclaimed himself the supreme head of the independent state formed by the ex-provinces of Socorro, Tunja, Pamplona, V√©lez and Casanare, and went with his army to take Bogot√°. President M√°rquez left Bogot√° to join with Generals Alc√°ntara Herr√°n and Mosquera, leaving the vice president, General Domingo Caycedo, in charge of the government from October 5, 1840 to November 19, 1840. Gonz√°lez rejected all proposals of compromise. He would have seized the unguarded Bogot√° if General Juan Jos√© Neira, distinguished in the war of independence, had not rallied the citizens and government forces and defeated Gonz√°lez in the Battle of Buenavista (or La Culebrera) in October. Neira was gravely wounded in the battle, and died of his wounds a few months later. This unexpected victory allowed the return of M√°rquez, with Alc√°ntara Herr√°n and Mosquera not far behind. During the week from November 22 to November 28, 1840, called la Gran Semana (The Great Week) rebel forces again threatened the capital. They advanced as far as Cajic√°. Governor Lino de Pombo declared a state of siege and General Francisco Urdaneta, military chief of the garrison, mobilized the entire population for defense. To raise the spirits of the defenders, a procession was held with the statue of Jesus of Nazareth of San Agust√≠n, the same that had led the forces of Antonio Nari√±o in the War of Independence. General Neira was carried on the shoulders of distinguished gentlemen and crowned with laurel in the Plaza Mayor, in the middle of an uproarious ovation. Meanwhile, the government's Division of the South approached, under the command of General Alc√°ntara Herr√°n, and the rebel army retired to the north. After the defeat of Obando, the only national figure among them, the rebels were unable to unite under a single leader. After their initial successes, this was a major element in their defeat.

The area that became Union Hill, however, was sparsely populated until the early 19th century. The British granted Bergen a new town charter in 1668. In 1682 they created Bergen County, which was named to honor their Dutch predecessors. That county comprised all of present-day Hudson, Bergen and Passaic counties. Sparsely inhabited during the 17th and 18th centuries, the southeast section of Bergen County had grown by the early 19th century to the point where it was deemed necessary to designate it a separate county. The New Jersey legislature created Hudson County in 1840, and in 1843, it was divided into two townships: Old Bergen Township (which eventually became Jersey City) and North Bergen Township, which was gradually separated into Hudson County's municipalities of Hoboken (1849), Weehawken and Guttenberg (1859), and Union Township (or simply Union,Business Directory Of North Hudson, North Hudson Hospital Association, Town of Union, N.J. 1905, Page 331Rules and Regulations of the Police Department of the Town of Union, N.J.

It was discovered on 14 November 1987, by Japanese astronomers Seiji Ueda and Hiroshi Kaneda at the Kushiro Observatory on Hokkaido, Japan. The likely elongated L-type asteroid has a rotation period of 15.5 hours. It was named for Venetia Burney, who first proposed 's name.  Orbit and classification  Burney is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. In the HCM assessment by Zappala and based on osculating Keplerian orbital elements, the asteroid has also been classified as a member of the Flora family (), a giant asteroid family and the largest family of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 1.9‚Äì2.6 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,226 days; semi-major axis of 2.24 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 3¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first observation as at Goethe Link Observatory in October 1950, more than 37 years prior to its official discovery observation at Kushiro.  Physical characteristics  Burney has been characterized as an L-type asteroid by Pan-STARRS survey and in the SDSS-based taxonomy. It is also an assumed S-type.  Rotation period  In December 2004, a rotational lightcurve of Burney was obtained from photometric observations by Donald Pray at the Carbuncle Hill Observatory . Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 15.515 hours with a brightness variation of 0.60 magnitude (). The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) also measured a high amplitude 0.71 and 0.95 magnitude, which indicates that asteroid has an elongated shape.  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE telescope, Burney measures between 3.64 and 4.083 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.29 and 0.36. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 ‚Äì derived from 8 Flora, the parent body of the Flora family ‚Äì and calculates a diameter of 4.50 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 13.9.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Venetia Burney (1918‚Äì2009) who, as a girl of eleven, first suggested the mythological name Pluto ‚Äì the Roman God of the Underworld who was able to make himself invisible ‚Äì for the dwarf planet , then considered the ninth planet in the Solar System. The naming of the asteroid \\"Burney\\" was not suggested by the asteroid discoverers. It was designated by the Working Group for Small Bodies Nomenclature (SBN) of Division III (Planetary Systems Sciences) of the International Astronomical Union. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 15 December 2005 ().

The vacant home sat in the path of Pellissippi Parkway and was demolished when the construction commenced on the limited access highway in the 1990s. History Mabry Hood was a two-story, Greek Revival style home with a columned, two-story high front portico. Although primarily brick, wood siding was located on the front face of the home behind the portico. The productive, plantation was occupied from c. 1830 through the early 20th Century by the George Mabry family. George Washington Mabry (21 July 1823 ‚Äì 23 July 1912) married Jeanette Hume in 1846, and built the mansion c. 1851, five years after the marriage. The mansion was constructed by slaves. Mabry was recorded as having 18 slaves in the 1850 census, but only 8 slaves in the 1860 census. Family By 1860, George Mabry and his wife Jeanette had at least five children. However, they also had a residence in what is now downtown Knoxville. Robert Tracy McKenzie noted that George Mabry declined to take the Confederate loyalty oath, which complicated his ability to travel to his west Knox County farm while the region was under the control of the Confederacy. His relationship did not improve when Union forces took control of East Tennessee, since he admitted that one reason he did not actively support the C.S.A. was his expectation that they would lose the war. His brother, Joseph Alexander Mabry II (c. 1825 - October 19, 1882) and nephew Joseph Alexander Mabry III (May 23, 1855 ‚Äì October 19, 1882),http://www.knoxnews.com/news/local/the-mercurial-mr-mabry- ep-404198630-357773161.html both immortalized in Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi, are also associated with this estate. However, Joseph Alexander Mabry II built a home in east Knoxville in 1858, the Mabry-Hazen House, Knoxville, which is now a historic house museum. The family's wealth, prominence and political connections are illustrated by how Jeanette Mabry avoided harm during the U.S. Civil War. Although George Mabry was officially \\"neutral\\", his Scottish-born wife was an outspoken opponent of secession. Robert Tracy McKenzie reports that Mrs. Mabry threatened to return to Scotland if the South was successful, and informed her husband that she would not live in the C.S.A. even if \\"Washington and Jefferson were both raised from the dead\\". Her wealth, prominence and being female, as well as having Joseph Mabry - an early secessionist leader - as a brother-in-law, are cited as reasons she was not harmed. Their neighbors, the James Harvey Baker family, did not share her views. Demolition Archaeological investigations were conducted in the early 1990s in preparation for the extension of Pellissippi Parkway. The Mabry estate was classified by this investigation as an Upland South plantation, but only a limited amount of cotton was found to have been grown on the estate. In addition to the mansion, two slaves quarters were identified and artifacts recovered. The site was considered significant for the insights it provided on the lives of the slaves and their relationship with their masters. The Mabry Hood House was one of several antebellum plantation homes located along Kingston Pike in the western Knox County. (The nearby Baker Peters House and Statesview, located near the intersection of Kingston Pike and Peters Road, still stand.) Unlike Knollwood, which was located on the top of Bearden Hill, the Mabry Hood House sat close to modern-day Kingston Pike, and near grade.

Primont, William G. Fiedler and Fred Zuccaro, 1964 The area that became West Hoboken, however, was sparsely populated until the early 19th century. The British granted Bergen a new town charter in 1668. In 1682 they created Bergen County, which was named to honor their Dutch predecessors. That county comprised all of present-day Hudson, Bergen and Passaic counties. Sparsely inhabited during the 17th and 18th centuries, the southeast section of Bergen County had grown by the early 19th century to the point where it was deemed necessary to designate it a separate county. The New Jersey legislature created Hudson County in 1840, and in 1843, it was divided into two townships: Old Bergen Township (which eventually became Jersey City) and North Bergen Township, which was gradually separated into Hudson County's municipalities of Hoboken (1849), Weehawken and Guttenberg (1859), and Union City Township in 1861, though it was colloquially known as Union Hill.Van Winkle, Daniel (1924).

Geography View of Carani The village of Carani is located 18 km north of Timi»ôoara, on the DJ692 county road. 3 km to the east lies the National Road DN69, to which Carani is linked by a local road. Additionally, it is accessible by rail, having its own station on the Timi»ôoara - Arad line. 5 km to the north lies the village of CƒÉlacea; to the east the village of Corne≈üti; to the south the centre of S√¢nandrei commune; and to the west, Hodoni. The Caran River passes through. History Carani was built in 1735 by Italian colonists brought by the Habsburg Monarchy as part of a massive effort to populate the Banat with Western Europeans. It was one of the first villages for colonists, founded and inhabited exclusively by Italians, being the only majority-Italian settlement in the entire Banat. The inhabitants grew silkworms, having been brought there in order to start silkworm production in the Banat. The village was founded under the name of Mercydorf (\\"Mercy's village\\"), in honour of General Claudius Florimund Mercy, who was charged with administering the Banat. Later, new waves of colonists arrived - French people and Germans from Alsace-Lorraine. The first came around 1752, then in 1763, so that by 1770, the village was substantially French in character. Religious services were held in three languages: Italian, French and German. However, with time, the village grew more German, in line with the rest of the Banat. By the end of the 18th century, Carani was already a Banat Swabian village. Tourist attractions *Count Mercy's castle (1733-1734) *Roman Catholic church (1734) Covaci Covaci (; ) is another of the commune's villages. It was founded in 1843 when German and a few Hungarian settlers were brought to an estate there. Until the latter half of the 20th century, the village had a strong German majority. This changed dramatically due to emigration, so that by 2002, of 751 inhabitants, there were 682 Romanians, 19 Germans, 19 Hungarians and 30 others. Covaci, which benefits economically from its proximity to Timi»ôoara, is about 10 km north of the city, on the right bank of the Bega Veche River. The village of Cerneteaz is 3 km to the east; to the west is the national road DN69, to which it is linked by a communal road and which goes to Timi»ôoara.

It is called a Japanese ring (or an N‚àí2 ring) if for every finite extension L of its quotient field K, the integral closure of A in L is a finitely generated A-module (or equivalently a finite A-algebra). A ring is called universally Japanese if every finitely generated integral domain over it is Japanese, and is called a Nagata ring, named for Masayoshi Nagata, (or a pseudo‚Äìgeometric ring) if it is Noetherian and universally Japanese (or, which turns out to be the same, if it is Noetherian and all of its quotients by a prime ideal are N‚àí2 rings.) A ring is called geometric if it is the local ring of an algebraic variety or a completion of such a local ring , but this concept is not used much. Examples Fields and rings of polynomials or power series in finitely many indeterminates over fields are examples of Japanese rings. Another important example is a Noetherian integrally closed domain (e.g. a Dedekind domain) having a perfect field of fractions. On the other hand, a PID or even a DVR is not necessarily Japanese. Any quasi-excellent ring is a Nagata ring, so in particular almost all Noetherian rings that occur in algebraic geometry are Nagata rings. The first example of a Noetherian domain that is not a Nagata ring was given by . Here is an example of a discrete valuation ring that is not a Japanese ring. Choose a prime p and an infinite degree field extension K of a characteristic p field k, such that Kp‚äÜk. Let the discrete valuation ring R be the ring of formal power series over K whose coefficients generate a finite extension of k. If y is any formal power series not in R then the ring R[y] is not an N‚àí1 ring (its integral closure is not a finitely generated module) so R is not a Japanese ring. If R is the subring of the polynomial ring k[x1,x2,...] in infinitely many generators generated by the squares and cubes of all generators, and S is obtained from R by adjoining inverses to all elements not in any of the ideals generated by some xn, then S is a 1-dimensional Noetherian domain that is not an N‚àí1 ring, in other words its integral closure in its quotient field is not a finitely generated S-module. Also S has a cusp singularity at every closed point, so the set of singular points is not closed. References * *Bosch, G√ºntzer, Remmert, Non- Archimedean Analysis, Springer 1984, * *A.

Three of his albums feature collaborations with vocalists Singh Kaur, Stephannie and Wendy Rule. Stadler's third album, Fairy Heartmagic was listed on Billboard's New Age Top 25 chart for four weeks in year 2000.Billboard Magazine, April 28, 2001 through May 17, 2001, chart position # 24 on Top 25 New Age Albums Several of his songs have been featured on compilations on multiple record labels in the USA and Europe. Stadler is the brother of professional golfer Craig Stadler. Background and artistic development Stadler knew at an early age that music would play a major role in his life. In school, in his hometown of San Diego, he learned to play the piano and most of the other instruments in the orchestra. When asked what he wanted to be when he grew up, he always replied, \\"I want to be an orchestra conductor!\\"Gary Stadler bio on Sequoia Records website In 1993 he wrote two songs, \\"Dream Spell\\" and \\"Awakening\\", for a play produced and performed in San Diego entitled The Goblin's Bride, based on Celtic myths of the realm of Faerie. Those songs were the genesis of his first album, Fairy of the Woods, released by Sequoia Records in 1996, and well received by the alternative market of independent New Age bookstores.New Age Voice Magazine wrote in August 1996: 'Strong and compelling melodies and lovely synth orchestral settings make Gary Stadler's Fairy of the Woods a magical charmer. Stadler's melodies and arrangements are classically structured, but his orchestrations offer a colorful imagination the opportunity to inhabit the auld Celtic realms of fairies and wizards, glens and caves, fireflies and stardust.' Stadler found a loyal audience who stayed with him as he added vocals and moved into a more acoustic direction on his second album released in 1998, Fairy NightSongs, featuring the lyrics and exquisite voice of recording artist Singh Kaur, already known to New Age listeners for her Crimson Series of recordings featuring harpist Kim Robertson.Steve Ryals wrote in New Age Retailer, August 1998: 'Kaur and Stadler bring the healing mystery of the fairy folk to life. Kaur's voice soars like fairies dancing on gentle night breezes, with lyrics and pure vocalizations. Stadler composed most of the music and contributed string bass and cello to his keyboards and piano. The 16-page cover booklet is filled with entrancing art and complete lyrics. Fairy Night Songs is absolutely exquisite from beginning to end.' For his third record, Stadler collaborated with Stephannie, a young vocalist and songwriter with a unique talent ‚Äî by recalling her dreams she composed lyrics in a form of glossolalia she referred to as a new language of Celtic fantasy. Joined by the well-known Celtic harpist Lisa Lynne, Stadler's third album, Fairy HeartMagic, was released on Sequoia Records in October 2000, recognized on Billboard's New Age Top 25.Billboard Magazine, April 28, 2001 through May 17, 2001, chart position # 24 on Top 25 New Age Albums The song Fairy NightSongs from this album was awarded JPF Best New Age/World song of 2004 following its appearance on a compilation.JPF Awards 2004 by genre at the Galaxy Concert Theatre November 7, 2004 in Santa Ana, CA This was the first of Stadler's CD to be enhanced with a CD-ROM session that offers two bonus songs in MP3 format and additional artwork for computer display. All of Stadler's later albums featured similar enhancements. Stadler's fourth album, Reflections of Faerie, in 2003 returned to instrumental pieces reminiscent of his first release but with a deeper and more intimate feel, mostly solo piano, with some featured harp artistry of Lisa Lynne. In 2004, for his fifth release Deep Within a Faerie Forest, Stadler collaborated with singer/composer Wendy Rule of Australia. This recording once again delves deep into the depths of the mystical Faerie realms with intriguing lyrics and unusual instrumentation. His sixth album, Faerie Lullabies was a retrospective produced in 2006 in which he chose the most peaceful and comforting pieces from his earlier releases and re-recorded them in the form of instrumental lullabies, intended for both children and their parents. Stadler's song \\"Fairy of the Woods\\" was featured on the sound track of A Magickal Life: Jeff McBride, produced and broadcast by Canada's VisionTV, a one-hour episode of their series Enigma True-Life Stories in January 2006.VisionTV Enigma documentary series His former wife Tamara contributed lyrics to his albums as well as the albums of fellow Vegas Vortex musical group Zingaia, also featured in the same documentary program. Album artwork The artwork on the first two of Stadler's six albums was created by San Diego artist Scott Thom, known for his original airbrush paintings coveted by collectors and his line of New Age greeting cards. Las Vegas artist Katlyn Breene of Zingaia (who also wrote some of the lyrics on Fairy NightSongs and Fairy HeartMagic) created the artwork for Stadler's remaining albums. Broad interests In addition to his musical talents, Stadler's interests and skills are widely varied. He has spent the majority of his business life as an electronics design engineer with emphasis on laser system design. His love for automobile mechanics won him 1st place in the San Diego Plymouth Troubleshooting contest, continuing on to win 4th place in the national Plymouth Troubleshooting contest. His interests include technical and historical glassblowing ‚Äî he currently specializes in the manufacture of distillation equipment for essential oils. He is known for his expertise in stage lighting and laser art (one of his first careers), producing \\"wet\\" light shows and laser light shows in the 1970s and 1980s, owning and operating an electronic design/manufacturing company from the mid-1970s through the late 1990s, and winning a Technical Achievement Oscar for innovations in the film lighting industry in 1994.IMDb: Academy Awards, USA: 1994 More recently, he has used these skills in the creation of innovative temporary art installations at the Burning Man festivals,Photos of Stadler's Burning Man installation, August 2005 events produced by the Vegas Vortex, and stage magic productions of Jeff McBride.

Starting with book 10 co-author Boyd Morrison takes over. The books follow the mysterious \\"Corporation\\" and its leader Juan Cabrillo. The \\"Oregon Files\\" come from the name of the ship on which the Corporation is based, the Oregon. The ship's name is based on the current State University of New York Maritime College training ship the TS Empire State VI. Its original name was the SS Oregon.  Books  The crew of the Oregon first appeared in Flood Tide. The main Oregon Files series is: *Golden Buddha (2003) *Sacred Stone (2004) *Dark Watch (2005) *Skeleton Coast (2006) *Plague Ship (2008) *Corsair (2009) *The Silent Sea (2010) *The Jungle (2011) *Mirage (2013) *Piranha (2015) *The Emperor's Revenge (2016) *Typhoon Fury (2017) *Shadow Tyrants (2018) *Final Option (2019) *Marauder (2020)  Overview  The Oregon is a high tech ship owned by a private secret service organization called 'the Corporation'. It is disguised as a rusty old tramp steamer. It mounts five cranes - three fore, two aft - only two of which are operational, one each fore and aft. To add to its appearance of authenticity, this disguise is highly detailed. This includes a fake mess hall, and a captain's cabin specially designed to be utterly repulsive, with features including specially designed chemicals to keep people away, a dysfunctional toilet, and depressing paintings of clowns on black velvet. In reality it is an extraordinarily sophisticated intelligence-gathering vessel with luxury facilities and top of the line technical capabilities. It is equipped with a moon pool for launching two minisubs, an Olympic swimming pool (in one of its ballast tanks), state-of-the-art medical facilities, and powered by a pair of revolutionary magnetohydrodynamic drives. It also uses an array of underwater vectored-thrusters to give it unparalleled maneuverability for a ship of its size - Dark Watch gives its dimensions as 560 feet long, with a 75-foot beam and a gross weight of 11,585 tons. The Oregon is also equipped with a suite of armaments that rivals most military capital ships, including: French-built Exocet anti-ship missiles, two torpedo tubes below the waterline (firing Russian-made TEST-71 and later Type 53-65 torpedoes, though Cabrillo has stated he would have preferred American Mk48 ADCAP), 20 mm multibarrel Gatling-style rotary cannons (probably M61 Vulcans) mounted behind steel plates on its hull, and an array of 7.62 mm caliber M60 machine guns concealed in dummy oil barrels welded onto her deck (affectionately known as their boarder repellents) that are all remotely operated with the most sophisticated fire-control systems. As well as these, the Oregon carries Russian-built cruise missiles of an unspecified type, a 40 mm Bofors autocannon (later replaced by a Metal Storm gun system), and at least one Rheinmetall 120 mm gun of a similar type to that of the M1A1 Abrams tank. Most novels talk about the 120 mm in the singular, however Dark Watch states that it has two - one on each side of the hull. The ship's control center, located deep within its hull, is said to have the feel of the starship Enterprise, including a large, central command chair in which Cabrillo sits when on the bridge, which is colloquially referred to as \\"The Kirk Chair\\".

The house is a two-story Greek Revival structure. It has a porte-cochere on the east side for carriages, and a rear wing that projects out on the southwest side of the house. It also has a columned, two-story front porch. The main body of the house is brick, but the rear wing was originally finished in wood siding. It was constructed in 1840 by Dr. James Harvey Baker, a local physician. He continued to own the house until his death during the Civil War. Harvey Baker was a Confederate supporter and his son Abner was a Confederate soldier. Dr. Baker was killed at the home by Union troops who traveled along Kingston Pike during a raid of Knoxville in June 1863. A marker in front of the home incorrectly claims he was killed while treating wounded Confederate soldiers in the house in 1864. There is no evidence he ever used the home as a hospital for wounded troops. In fact, Dr. Baker is likely one of the first people killed by Union forces in Knox County according to historian Joan Markel at the McClung Museum. The Union troops fired through a barricaded door in the home, and hit Dr. Baker. His son Abner was away at war at the time of the incident, but became a historical figure upon his return in 1865 when he shot and killed a man named William Hall in downtown Knoxville. Hall worked for the clerk of court and fought for the Union during the Civil War. Early accounts of the shooting make no mention of it being an act of vengeance. Instead, newspapers claim the fight was between two people with an \\"old grudge\\" who were on opposite sides of the war, with partisan papers mostly disagreeing on whether the shooting was self-defense. A book published in 1976 claims Abner believed the man he shot was somehow involved in his father's death. Whatever the motivation, Abner was immediately captured and jailed when the shooting occurred. That night, an angry mob of Unionists overran the jail, took Abner outside, and hanged him from a tree in Downtown Knoxville. The Baker house was sold in the late 19th century to George Peters. The Baker Peters House was one of several antebellum plantation homes on Kingston Pike. Mabry Hood House, located to the west on Kingston Pike, was demolished in the late 20th century to make way for Pellissippi Parkway. The Baker Peters House avoided a similar fate, but the site has been compromised/saved by commercial uses. The building itself now houses a restaurant/nightclub, while the land around it is occupied by parking lots and businesses. Crescent Bend (The Armstrong-Lockett House), Bleak House, and Knollwood, all located farther to the east on Kingston Pike, remain in good condition. The upstairs of the Baker Peters house is currently in a renovation process and plans to re-open as a restaurant and piano bar in early-2016. The downstairs of the house is a dental office and has been since 1989. References * Knoxville Daily Register (newspaper), June 23, 1863. * McKenzie, Robert Tracy.

In June 1995, he extended his contract by an additional year. \\"Reserve forl√¶nger\\", Politiken, 14 June 1995, p.16 Winde got his senior breakthrough with AaB during the 1995-96 Danish Superliga season.

S√∏ren Olsen, \\"Bundklub havnet i en ond cirkel\\", Politiken, 27 August 1995, p.16 When Gill suffered another injury in November 1995, Winde was praised for his displays for AaB.

Winde vil v√¶k fra AaB, Bold.dk, 19 February 2000 He was loaned out to Austrian Bundesliga club SW Bregenz in January 2001, brought in by manager Ove Flindt Bjerg, a former AaB player. \\"Danskere til √òstrig\\", Jyllands-Posten, 27 January 2001, p.15 He stayed with Bregenz for one-and-a-half years as the starting goalkeeper, before returning to AaB in May 2002. Henrik Niss, \\"M√•lmand vender hjem\\", Politiken, 15 May 2002, p.11 Having played no Superliga games for AaB since April 1997, Winde agreed a January 2003 move to Superliga rivals Esbjerg fB. Kasper Krogh, \\"Esbjerg k√∏ber AaB-m√•lmand\\", Jyllands-Posten, 2 October 2002, p.16 Winde forced Martin S.
