Robert Greenberg Distinguished University professor emeritus at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Her research focuses on the role of organic cofactors as partners of enzymes catalyzing difficult biochemical reactions, especially folic acid and cobalamin (vitamin B12). Among other honors, she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2002 and the Institute of Medicine in 2004. Early life and education Matthews was born in Cambridge, England while her father, biochemist David E. Green, was on sabbatical there. Matthews earned her B.A. in biology summa cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1960. As an undergraduate, and for three years thereafter, she worked with George Wald studying a new intermediate in the bleaching of the visual pigment rhodopsin that temporally coincided with initiation of visual excitation. She then went to graduate school in biophysics at the University of Michigan, where she did her dissertation research in the laboratory of Vincent Massey. She received her Ph.D. in 1969. Academic career After finishing her Ph.D., Matthews remained at the University of Michigan as a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Charles Williams in the department of Biological Chemistry and Assistant Research Scientist in the Biophysics Research Division in 1978. She was promoted to Associate Professor in 1981 became a full professor in 1986, and became the G. Robert Greenberg Distinguished University Professor in 1995. In 2002, she assumed the position of Senior Research Professor and Charter Faculty Member of the Life Sciences Institute. She retired in 2007, assuming professor emeritus status.  Awards  She received numerous recognitions and honors during her career, the Repligen award given by the ACS (2001), election to the National Academy of Sciences (2002), the American Academy of Microbiology (2002), the Institute of Medicine (2004), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2005), and the American Philosophical Society (2009). She received the William C. Rose Award given by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in 2000 and the Repligen Corporation Award in Chemistry of Biological Processes given by the American Chemical Society in 2001. She was the Frederick Gowland Hopkins Lecturer at 12th International Conference of Pteridines and Folates in 2001, an honor she particularly appreciated because her father had worked with Hopkins. She serves on the Medical Advisory Board of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and has served on the Council of the National Academy of Sciences. The University of Michigan hosts a professorship honoring Matthews; since 2009 James Bardwell has held the Rowena G. Matthews Collegiate Professorship. Research Dr. Matthew's research focused on one-carbon metabolism, with particular emphasis on the enzymes that catalyze the de novo generation of methyl groups: methionine synthase, a B-12 dependent enzyme in humans, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. Her collaboration with geneticist Rima Rozen at McGill University led to the cloning of human methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and the characterization of the C677T polymorphism associated with hyperhomocysteinemia in humans. The polymorphism can lead to a high amount of homocysteine in the bloodstream. High concentrations of homocysteine in the plasma can increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases and the use of folic acid have been shown to decrease the amounts in humans. In collaboration with Prof. Martha Ludwig they elucidated the first X-ray structure of vitamin B12 bound to a protein, cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase.

The organization was originally created by and for traveling salesmen though today it is open to other occupational groups.  History  In January 1882 a meeting was held by a small group of traveling salesmen at a hotel in Chicago to discuss forming a cooperative society to address the issues facing their profession. The Travelers Protective Association of the United States was formally established on June 24, 1882, in Bellefontaine, Ohio. Its original goals were to obtain special concessions from hotels, railroads and transportation agencies and advocated on behalf of their members if they had a grievance. By 1890, however, the group was on the verge of financial collapse and felt that it could only remain active if it added an accident insurance benefit. That same year the organization moved its headquarters from Chicago to St. Louis and changed its name slightly to its current form.Alvin J. Schmidt Fraternal Orders (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press), 1930, pp.331-2 Originally only open to executives of manufacturing, wholesale or \\"jobbing\\" businesses and their sales representatives, by 1979 it was open to all male traveling salesmen between 18 and 55 and people from other occupational groups could be admitted by a special review of the board of directors.

His work was recognized with a tribute at the Palacio de Bellas Artes shortly before his death and membership in the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. Life Messeguer was born in Mora de Ebro, Tarragona, Spain (Catalonia). During the Spanish Civil War, his family (which supported the Second Spanish Republic) left his hometown to live in Barcelona, where he studied painting under Enrique Assad. In 1944, when he was fourteen, the family moved to Mexico and when Messeguer became an adult, he obtained Mexican citizenship. In Mexico, he furthered his artistic studies at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\", a student of Diego Rivera and Jos√© Clemente Orozco who strongly influenced his work. He died of leukemia in Mexico City at age 51. Career He had over fifty individual and collective exhibitions of his work including the Bienal Interamericana de Pintura y Grabado in Mexico City (1960), the Tokyo Biennal (1961) and the Biennal de Jeunes in Paris (1961, 1963, 1965) and individual shows at the Museo de Arte Moderno and other venues. His murals include La edad de oro at the Casino de la Selva (1958), El fen√≥meno de la comunicaci√≥n ling√º√≠stica at the Instituto Mexicano de la Audici√≥n y el Lenguaje (1963), Las luchas revolucionarias de M√©xico at the Unidad Habitacional Ermita-Zaragoza (1978), El Quijote, mensaje oportuno at the SHCP Cultural Center (1981) and El desarrollo hist√≥rico y econ√≥mico-cultural del hombre at the economics school of the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico (1983) . In addition to producing art, Messeguer also served as the director of La Esmeralda and the director of the Centro de Estudios Superiores de Investigaci√≥n Pl√°stica of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes . His career was recognized by membership in the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana and in 1983 the Palacio de Bellas Artes presented a tribute-exhibition. Artistry He was a painter (mostly oils), engraver and muralist, but most of his work was in murals. His early influences were those of his teachers at La Esmeralda. Diego Rivera strongly influenced the anecdotic character of his compositions and Jos√© Clemente Orozco, with humanism and themes of the universal. Antonio Rodr√≠guez Luna stated ‚ÄúMesseguer never forgot the social concerns of the old masters, nor the most appropriate method for representing human beings (figuration): but he rejected their followers who were content to repeat what had been created by their predecessors.‚Äù His works did not tell stories like that of classic Mexican muralism but they did not betray the movement pictorially or ideologically. Instead they were personal works with a popular ambiance, blending critical humor and a commitment to the disadvantaged. Other influences in his work include that of Catalan architect Antoni Gaud√≠ in the use of organic forms with emotive effect and Rembrandt‚Äôs use of the chiaroscuro effect. One principal example of the latter is the La creaci√≥n y la econom√≠a, where a pool of intense light transcends the struggles between humanism and obscurantism. The work of his last ten years of life began to use paint as a malleable material, almost pastes to model in thick impastos to converge the qualities of mass, color and light. In 1962 he exhibited with Francisco Moreno Capdevila and Jos√© Hern√°ndez Delgadillo as the Nueva Presencia group, also known as the Interioristas. He was not a member of the Generaci√≥n de la Ruptura, with its stance against politically and socially charged art. Nor did Messeguer approve of the evolution of abstract art in Mexico although some elements of his work did stray towards it.

He has worked in many forms of animation, from traditional hand drawn and early digital work to 3D and motion capture projects. His 1990 animation Maxwell‚Äôs Demon is considered one of the earliest examples of creative use of desktop computing for animation production.Mitchell, A.J., Der Prix Ars Electronica, pp. 18- Die Geburt einer neuen Kunst/The Birth of a New Art, Publisher Hannes Leopoldseder, 1991, Duesing has taught at The University of Cincinnati, College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning and is a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. Duesing‚Äôs work has been exhibited and broadcast throughout the world including: The Sundance Film Festival, SIGGRAPH, The Tate Gallery, Film Forum, and The Museum of Modern Art, New York. He has received numerous awards and grants including a Creative Capital grant, an award of distinction and an honorable mention from Prix Ars Electronica, an American Film Institute Independent Filmmaker Fellowship, National Endowment for the Arts grants, and a residency at the Headlands Center for the Arts. Education and background Duesing studied painting and writing at the University of Cincinnati earning a BFA in 1980. He also received his MFA in film and video from the University of Cincinnati in 1983. While there he studied writing with Terry Stokes, animation with Caroline Leaf, Carmen D'Avino, Richard Protovin, Louis Rockwood and video with Jud Yalkut. After graduate school Duesing worked on live action video and television projects while continuing to work on hand drawn animation. During this time he was exposed to, and began to explore, early digital imaging techniques on mainframe computers. In 1986 he went shopping for a typewriter and ended up buying a desktop computer. This began his experiments with what then was considered low-end digital imaging. In 1986 he was hired as an assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati. In 1997 he moved to Carnegie Mellon University as an associate professor. Work Duesing‚Äôs animation work is visually lush and playful. In all of his work there are no cuts. His animation does not appear to be edited in any way. Instead of simply cutting away, metamorphosis continuously changes characters and environments to fit a new scene. Reality is often subjugated to emotional and relationship themes. As his work developed from hand drawn to 3D computer the technical complexity of this metamorphosis increased. There are several themes that reoccur in Duesing‚Äôs animation. These themes include: how fear or confusion affects decisions and how humanity is altered through cosmetic culture, technology and social media. The themes are often handled simultaneously on different levels, sometimes with sarcasm or subtle humor, other times characters are emotionally void. His characters usually have some particular flaw, whether physical or emotional. Through metamorphosis all of these themes are interconnected, usually with an open-ended resolution. Duesing‚Äôs animation frequently offers comical and eccentric reflections on human interactions and desires in a realm poisoned by environmental disaster, cut off from nature or populated by smooth operators and creepy manipulators. On one level his imagery is composed of entertaining cartoon-like characters in various kinds of richly rendered environments. On another level his work probes serious sociological issues in a way that is both provocative and disturbing. This futuristic landscape, can feel curiously familiar. Phantom relationships, in which hybrids of animals and humans communicate through fragments of conversations, often sound like clips from forgotten films or television shows. The narratives can be ambiguous, unfolding with the logic of dreams and the speed of cyber-communication. Duesing has spoken and taught about animation in the context of social history. He has also discussed his perceptions on the relationship between historic works of art and the desire for artists throughout the millennia to represent motion and sequence in their work. These interests can also be seen in his work. Duesing has done collaborative installation work and been involved in a variety of print and book projects. His frequent collaborator is Carnegie Mellon Computer Science Professor, Jessica Hodgins. His print and installation projects relate to his animation work with characters and sequential action.

During the Bangladesh Liberation War, the Yugoslav Wars, the Rwandan genocide, the Iraqi Civil War, the second Sino-Japanese war, and the Rohingya genocide; the mass rapes that had been an integral part of those conflicts brought the concept of genocidal rape to international prominence. Although war rape has been a recurrent feature in conflicts throughout history, it has usually been looked upon as a by-product of conflict, and not an integral part of military policy. The violence against women during the Partition of India has also been cited as an example of genocidal rape.  Genocide debate  Some scholars argue that the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide should state that mass rape is a genocidal crime. Other scholars argue that genocidal rape is already included in the definition under article two\\"...any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: :(a) Killing members of the group; :(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; :(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; :(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; :(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Article 2\\" of the convention. Catherine MacKinnon argues that the victims of genocidal rape are used as a substitute for the entire ethnic group, that rape is used as a tool, with the target being the destruction of the entire ethnic group. Siobhan Fisher has argued that forced impregnation and not the rape itself constitutes genocide. She says, \\"Repeated rape alone is still ‚Äòjust‚Äô rape, but rape with the intent to impregnate is something more.\\" Lisa Sharlach argues that this definition is too narrow because these mass rapes should not be defined as genocide based solely on those raped having been forcibly impregnated.  Rape as genocide  According to Amnesty International, the use of rape during times of war is not a by-product of conflicts, but is a pre-planned and deliberate military strategy. In the last quarter of a century, the majority of conflicts have shifted from wars between nation states to communal and intrastate civil wars. During these conflicts the use of rape as a weapon against the civilian population by state and non-state actors has become more frequent. Journalists and human rights organizations have documented campaigns of genocidal rape during conflicts in Former Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Liberia, Sudan, Uganda, and during the civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The strategic aims of these mass rapes are twofold. The first is to instill terror in the civilian population, with the intent to forcibly dislocate them from their property. The second is to degrade the chance of possible return and reconstitution by having inflicted humiliation and shame on the targeted population and to decrease social cohesion of a targeted group. These effects are strategically important for non-state actors, as it is necessary for them to remove the targeted population from the land. Rape as genocide is well suited for campaigns which involve ethnic cleansing and genocide, as the objective is to destroy, or forcefully remove the target population, and ensure they do not return. One objective of genocidal rape is forced pregnancy, so that the aggressing actor not only invades the targeted population's land, but their bloodlines and families as well. However, those unable to bear children are also subject to sexual assault. Victims‚Äô ages can range from children to women in their eighties.  Documented instances  In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) it is estimated that in 2011 alone there were 400,000 rapes. In the DRC, genocidal rape is focused on the destruction of family and communities. An interview with a survivor gave an account of gang rape, forced cannibalism of a fetus taken from an eviscerated woman, and child murder. During the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, members of the Pakistani military and supporting Bihari and Razaker militias raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bangladeshi women in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape. Some women may have been raped as many as eighty times in a night. In the ongoing War in Darfur the Janjaweed militias have carried out actions described as genocidal rape, with not just women, but children also being raped, as well as babies being bludgeoned to death and the sexual mutilation of victims being commonplace. During the Second Sino-Japanese War the Imperial Japanese Army during the Battle of Nanking carried out what has come to be known as the Rape of Nanking, which has been described by Adam Jones as \\"one of the most savage instances of genocidal rape\\". The violence saw tens of thousands of women gang raped and killed. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East estimated that 20,000 women were raped, including infants and the elderly.Paragraph 2, p. 1012, Judgment International Military Tribunal for the Far East. A large portion of these rapes were systematized in a process where soldiers would search door-to-door for young girls, with many women taken captive and gang raped. The women were often killed immediately after being raped, often through explicit mutilation\\"A Debt of Blood: An Eyewitness Account of the Barbarous Acts of the Japanese Invaders in Nanjing,\\" 7 February 1938, Dagong Daily, Wuhan edition Museums.cnd.org or by stabbing a bayonet, long stick of bamboo, or other objects into the vagina. Young children were not exempt from these atrocities, and were cut open to allow Japanese soldiers to rape them. On 19 December 1937, the Reverend James M. McCallum wrote in his diary: > I know not where to end. Never I have heard or read such brutality. Rape! > Rape! Rape! We estimate at least 1,000 cases a night, and many by day.

Many veterans, even today, are reluctant to talk about it.\\"Beyond Duty: The Reason Some Soldiers Commit Atrocities, Walter S. Zapotoczny Jr., Fonthill Media, Jun 29, 2017 - History During the Rwandan genocide the violence took a gender specific form, with women and girls being targeted in a systematic campaign of sexual assault. It is estimated that between 250,000 and 500,000 were victims of rape. Those who survived the genocidal rape found themselves stigmatised, and many also discovered that they were infected with HIV. This has resulted in these women being denied their rights to property and inheritance as well as their employment chances being restricted. The first woman charged and convicted for genocidal rape was Pauline Nyiramasuhuko. In 1996 Beverly Allen wrote Rape Warfare: The Hidden Genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia in which the term genocidal rape was first introduced, she used the term to describe the actions of the Serbian armed forces who had a policy of rape with the intention of genocide. In her book she compares genocidal rape to biological warfare. During the conflict in Bosnia Allen gave a definition of genocidal rape as \\"a military policy of rape for the purpose of genocide currently practiced in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia by the Yugoslav army the Bosnian Serb forces and the irregular Serb forces known as Chetniks\\" Coverage of the mass rapes during the ethnic cleansing carried out by the Serbian forces in the 1990s began the analysis over the use of rape as a part of genocide. Catherine MacKinnon argues that the mass rapes during the conflict \\"were a simultaneous expression of misogyny and genocide\\", and argues that rape can be used as a form of extermination.\\"It is also rape unto death, rape as massacre, rape to kill and to make the victims wish they were dead. It is rape as an instrument of forced exile, rape to make you leave your home and never want to go back. It is rape to be seen and heard and watched and told to others: rape as spectacle.

The oldest parts of the church date from the late 12th century; with the halted construction of the tower about a century later, building activity ceased. The church contains medieval murals as well as a number of medieval furnishings and pieces of art. It lies in the Diocese of Visby of the Church of Sweden.  History and architecture  View of the interior towards to choir The oldest parts of the church are the late Romanesque choir and the apse, dating from the late 12th century. To this the nave was added during the late part of the same century. Construction of the broad tower started about a hundred years later but was never finished; hence the somewhat squat appearance of the church today. It seems in fact that construction of the church came to a rapid end: apart from the half-finished tower, the main southern portal also seems to have been finished in a haphazard, chaotic way. The choir portal is Romanesque in style and carried some sculpted reliefs, possibly executed by the workshop or artist known as Sigraf. The similarly Romanesque northern portal of the church is also decorated with sculptures. Inside, the church displays a set of wall paintings carried out at the end of the Middle Ages, probably just before the reformation and possibly by the same artist who decorated Lau Church. Among the furnishings, the dominating triumphal cross, dating from the middle of the 13th century, and a partly preserved baptismal font, executed by the Romanesque workshop or sculptor referred to as Hegvald sometime during the end of the 12th century, are especially notable. The pulpit dates from 1740 and the unusually decorated altarpiece from 1653. The church was renovated in 1953‚Äì54. Alva Church belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies within the Diocese of Visby.

On the crew and casting Schwarz said in a press release \\"We are part of the SAG Ultra Low Budget Agreement, which means that the Screen Actors Guild recognizes that we are a tiny budget independent film, and is allowing us to hire professional actors alongside non-union actors, and for a fraction of what it would normally cost to hire them. Using local talent is so important to us, especially since we have such a wealth of talent in this town. Already cast are Ryan Stiffelman [NCHS Class of 2011], in the role of Danny, the youngest, oddball traveler of the five friends, and Ryan Timberlake [also Class of 2011] in the role of Eddy, a philosophizing stoner they meet along the way.\\" Cinematographer Elisha Christian, best known for his work in 2012's Save The Date with director Michael Mohan, had been in contact with Schwarz about the project since early 2013, but officially came on board in July once the film had secured its funding. Schwarz worked alongside Adrienne Stern, the NYC casting director and owner of ASC Casting to cast the principal and adult roles in the film, securing Bonnie Wright, Jacob Zachar, Christian Coulson, Anastasia Barzee, Maxwell Caulfield and Anna Holbrook. =Filming= Principal photography began on August 6, 2013 in New York City. Filming took place at Washington Square Park on August 9, 2013. Scenes were also shot in Brooklyn from August 19 to August 26, 2013. Filming also took place at New Canaan, Norwalk and Stamford, Connecticut. Stamford served as the backdrop for the scenes featuring Atlanta, while some residential area from New Canaan has been presented as rural setting in Georgia. Talking about the filming locations Scandiffio said that, \\"We realized we could get away with it visually with certain pieces of property and roads in Connecticut as the film travels to Georgia, because the film is dialogue heavy, a lot of it will be interior shots and we can easily get away with most of it being filmed in Connecticut.\\" Filming wrapped on August 29, 2013. Music Kendall Eagan, a member of Chloe Sunshine and another alum of New Canaan High School, will serve as the chief music supervisor for the film, with the assistance of Ryan Timberlake. Screening In April 2015, Nico Scandiffio and Abigail Ann Schwarz hosted the screening of the film at Ridgefield Playhouse.

It was built during the 13th century, but the interior re-decorated in 1900‚Äì1902 after plans by artist Axel Haig. Several of the furnishings of the church are medieval. The church is in the Diocese of Visby of the Church of Sweden.  History and architecture  View towards the choir The oldest part of the church is the tower, dating from about 1200. The tower originally belonged to an earlier church building from the 12th century, the nave and choir of which was replaced with the current building circa 1250. The sculptured choir portal originally also belonged to the earlier church. The interior of the church was heavily remodelled in a Neo-Medieval style between 1900‚Äì1902 after plans by architect and artist Axel Haig (known in Swedish as Axel Hermann H√§gg, 1835‚Äì1921). The dominant wall paintings are consequently designed by Haig. A few stained glass windows remain but were complemented by modern replicas during the renovation. The furnishings of the church are still largely medieval: an altarpiece from the early 14th century, a triumphal cross and baptismal font, both from the middle of the 13th century, and a carved wooden Madonna from circa 1500 are all in their original milieu. The organ is an elaborate Gothic Revival piece, made for the renovation in 1902 and inspired by medieval French organs.

It was built in 1841 in the early Carolina Farmhouse style brought to North America by planters from the West Indies. The north parlor and the bedroom above, were the first parts of the house built by John J. Cole and his slaves in the early 1840s as a summer home for his wife Carolina Corley and their children. John J. Coles plantation was approximately 10 miles from downtown Bluffton. His father-in-law owned Moreland Plantation, located on present day Palmetto Bluff. By 1860, Cole had more than doubled the size of the house and his family, at which time the front and side windows in the front rooms were replaced with larger windows. The original parlor windows were reused in the dining room and back bedroom. The interior is clad with wide heart pine boards. The last remaining slave cabin in Bluffton still resides on the property. The original unattached summer kitchen was moved to the rear of the property when a large square attached kitchen was added to the main house in the 1930s. Beetles damaged the original summer kitchen and the structure was reconstructed with original and new wood. Following the Civil War, Mr. Cole who had contracted tuberculosis during his service, died. The Cole family sold their holdings in Bluffton and moved to Texas in 1874. Mrs. Kate Du Bois, wife of the federally appointed Post Master, purchased the property then sold it in 1882 to Mrs. George Cuthbert Heyward, Sr. and it remained in the Heyward family until its purchase in 1998 by the Bluffton Historical Preservation Society.

Born in Narbonne in 1825, Balansa made numerous collecting trips for the Mus√©um national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris which holds most of his plant specimens. Others are in Mus√©um de Toulouse. His first journey, from 1847 to 1848, was to Algiers and Mostaganem in Algeria. From 1850 to 1853, Balansa returned to Algeria, collecting plants again in Mostaganem and later in Oran, Muaskar, the Northern Sahara, Biskra and Batna. From 1854 to 1855 he undertook his first trip to Asia travelling first to Smyrna and the surrounding regions in April and May, 1854. From March until October 1855 he lived in Mersin and the Taurus Mountains of Cilicia. The following year, he travelled from June until September 1856 from Tarsus to Kayseri in Cappadocia. In 1857 he settled with his family in Smyrna. From May until July 1857 he explored U≈üak and the surrounding area and until 1865 he undertook tours to Phrygia and Cilicia. In 1866, he made a trip to Lazistan and the Caucasus, where he collected from June to August in the area of Trabzon and Rize. In autumn 1866 he returned to France. A year later, in 1867 he collected in Morocco in the area of Mogador, the Atlas Mountains and Marrakech. From 1868 to 1872 Balansa stayed overseas in New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands. During this time he was Director of the Jardin d'Acclimatation in Noum√©a. From 1873 to 1877, he made his first trip to Paraguay, followed by a second from 1878 to 1884. In the years from 1885 to 1889, he collected in Tonkin and undertook a trip to the island of Java. In his (1890) second stay at Balansa died in Hanoi.

He was undefeated in his first five races, culminating in a victory over a strong international field in the Eclipse Stakes in 1983. He also defeated the Prix du Jockey Club winner Caerleon at Phoenix Park Racecourse and won the Prix du Lys in France. He ran poorly in his only race after the Eclipse and was retired to stud, where he had no impact as a sire of winners. Background Solford was a bay horse with a white blaze and white markings on three of his feet bred in Kentucky by King Ranch. Solford was sired by Nijinsky, the Canadian-bred winner of the English Triple Crown in 1970 who went on to become an important stallion, siring horses such as Ferdinand, Lammtarra, Sky Classic and Shahrastani. His dam, Fairness, never raced, but was a full-sister to Prove Out, and had previously produced the Vosburgh Stakes winner No Bias. Fairness' dam Equal Venture, was a sister of the Triple Crown winner Assault. As a yearling, Solford was sent to the Fasig-Tipton sales where he was sold for $1,700,000 to representatives of the British owner Robert Sangster. Like most of Sangster's best horses, Solford was sent to Ireland to be trained by Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle. The name of Solford had previously been used for a gelding which won the Champion Hurdle in 1940. Racing career Solford ran twice as a two-year-old in 1982 and was undefeated, winning minor events at the Curragh and Leopardstown. On each occasion he was made the 2/5 favourite but his margins of victory were narrow and he was not considered one of his stable's best juveniles. Solford was scheduled to make his three-year-old debut in the Ballysax Race at the Curragh in April but was withdrawn just before the race after appearing sickly in the paddock. He was found to be running a slight temperature and was suffering from a skin condition. After more than a month of the course he returned for a race over ten furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse in which he was matched against his stable companion Caerleon. Ridden by the stable's first-choice jockey Pat Eddery Solford started favourite and won by three-quarters of a length from Caerleon, who was carrying eight pounds more. On the day in June that Caerleon won the Prix du Jockey Club over 2400 metres at Chantilly Racecourse, Solford contested the Group Three Prix du Lys over the same course and distance. Wearing blinkers for the only time in his career, Solford started the 1/2 favourite and won easily from moderate opposition. A month later, Solford was moved up to Group One class and was tested against older horses in the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse. He was made second favourite at odds of 3/1 against a field which included Stanerra, Time Charter and Tolomeo. The pace was very slow in the early stages and the race developed into a sprint in the last quarter mile with several runners struggling to obtain a clear run. Eddery sent Solford into the lead approaching the final furlong and the colt held off a series of challenges to win by a head from Muscatite, with Tolomeo, Guns of Navarone and Stanerra less than a length behind. At York Racecourse on 17 August, Solford started second favourite behind The Derby winner Teenoso in the Group Two Great Voltigeur Stakes. The Irish colt looked unimpressive before the race and ran poorly to finish fourth of the five runners, fifteen lengths behind the winner Seymour Hicks. Assessment In the official International Classification for 1983, Solford was given a rating of 84, making joint-eighth among the season's three-year-old colt, nine pounds below the top-rated Shareef Dancer. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 127. Stud record Solford retired from racing at the end of 1983 to become a breeding stallion at the Winfield Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. He proved to be a very disappointing sire, with the best of his offspring probably being Enzo, the winner of the Listed Eyrefield Stakes at the Curragh in 1990.

(Begrijpt U Nu Waarom Ik Huil?) is a 1969 documentary film by Dutch director Louis van Gasteren. In the late 1960s Van Gasteren was drawn to the work of the Leiden University professor Jan Bastiaans treating traumatized war survivors. Gasteren was concerned about the psychotherapeutic treatment with LSD on a former concentration camp prisoner in Bastiaans' clinic. The patient focused on was named Joop. Joop was arrested by the Nazis in September 1941 and underwent a long journey through hell among different camps until he was liberated by the Russians in 1945. Joop returned home to his wife a different man. He had nightmares and was incapable of ordinary human contact. With two cameras Gasteren shot about six and a half hours of the first treatment Joop underwent at Bastiaans. Particular attention is paid to details: Joop's hands, the sweat on his forehead, a tear running down his cheek slowly. From this Gasteren edited more than one hour of film that made a big impression at release and even led to questions in Parliament. 16 mm, b/w, 62 minutes. In 2003 Van Gasteren directed a sequel, The Price of Survival, about Joop's surviving family and their own continued suffering after his death in 2000.JOURNAL OF THE INTERDISCIPLINARY CROSSROADS, Vol. 3 (No. 1) April 2006, p. 189 62 min, 35mm.

His first project was creating new character animation for the arcade game Discs of Tron, for which he was given onscreen credit.Discs of Tron Arcade Game Easter Eggs at Digital Press: The Video Game Database Between 1982 and 1984, he created in-game raster graphics and animation for numerous Bally/Midway arcade games, including Kozmik Krooz'r, Spy Hunter and Zwackery, the latter being the first game for which Colin was credited as a game designer. 1985's Sarge was designed by Colin along with Bally/Midway programmer Jeff Nauman. It was their first complete collaboration in a partnership that would continue into the 21st century.

It includes Intag Cloud Forest Reserve, which has primary cloud forest at 1800‚Äì2800 m and a high biodiversity. Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve borders to the North.  Geography  Intag is approximately 1800 meters above sea level. Parts of the Intag region are sub-tropical rainforests in the Andes. The Andes there are steep and rugged. Including the Intag river, there are other rivers and streams in the mountains.  Biodiversity and Environment  Intag includes or used to include one of the areas with the highest biodiversity on earth.http://www.uasb.edu.ec/UserFiles/369/File/PDF/CentrodeReferencia/Temasdeanalisis2/derechoshumanosysistemascarcelarios/articulos/Actualidad/Participacionyactivismo- Garbay.pdf It harbors numerous endangered species, including the spectacled bear, the harlequin frog, and the jaguar. The region faces various environmental concerns. Reforestation takes place in Intag. A Mitsubishi subsidiary, which had contaminated Jun√≠n river and caused deforestation, was expelled in 1997. DECOIN (Defensa y Conservaci√≥n Ecol√≥gica de Intag) an environmental organization, has been founded in 1995 and has created a sensitivity concerning a possible destruction of this environment.  Mining  In 2002, the ministry of energy and mining offered mining concessions in Intag publicly. Canadian mining corporation Ascendant Copper received those in 2004. There was resistance against by Radio Intag., which has existed since 2007. he intention of mining is opposed by locals. Locals were threatened and beaten by security staff hired by Ascendant Copper. Not only human rights abuses by companies, but also by government have occurred. Ascendant Copper would face difficulties and created a plan to buy land. The Inter-American Human Rights Commission Organization was informed. With support of Canadian organizations Friends of Nature and MiningWatch Canada, a claim against Ascendant Copper for having violated safeguards established in standards for multinational companies was filed with the OECD. In 2005, three months before Copper Mesa (then Ascendant Copper) was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, County Mayor Auki Titua√±a wrote to the Finance and Audit Committee of the Toronto Stock Exchange: \\"We consider it to be appropriate and fair that before accepting open \\"trade\\" of Ascendant Copper Corporation's stocks in the Stock Market, you evaluate in depth the \\"new\\" company's merits...\\" The government of Ecuador has since prohibited any activity of Ascendant Copper in Ecuador. ODELCO of Chile and ENAMI are exploring the area. In 2002, the Ministry of Energy and Mines auctioned off 7,000 hectares of subsoil rights in Jun√≠n. The following year, Cotacachi Municipality, six parishes, communities and NGOs requested a restraining order from the courts. Under Rich Earth is a film covering this inter alia and was debuted at Toronto International Film Festival.  Population  Intag had a population of 14,000 people in 2000. Its parishes in Cotacachi Canton were Apuela, Garc√≠a Moreno, Vacas Galindo, Pe√±aherrera, Cuellaje and Plaza Guti√©rrez. Intag has more than 90 hamlets. The population of Intag partly is of indigenous or African origin. In the 2001 census, malnutrition and poverty exceeded 60% of the population. Its natural environment mainly is its livelihood. Many residents of Intag make their living by subsistence farming or cattle raising. Numerous Intag people grow coffee on their farms, many of whom participating in a fairetrade-growers' association.

He was a middle-order right-handed batsman and an occasional wicketkeeper who played first-class cricket for Nottinghamshire between 1961 and 1964. He was born in Bradford, Yorkshire and died at Macclesfield, Cheshire. He was the father of the England Test wicketkeeper Steve Rhodes and grandfather of George Rhodes. As a 17-year-old, Rhodes played for Yorkshire's junior team in 1954. And in 1959 he played for both Worcestershire's second eleven and a non-first-class Nottinghamshire side. From 1960 he played for Nottinghamshire's second team, but as a wicketkeeper his passage into the first team was barred by Geoff Millman who became a Test player soon after. In 1961, he played in seven first-class matches for Nottinghamshire purely as a batsman, being tried as an opener alongside the established Norman Hill in five of them; the experiment was not a success, and Rhodes' highest score in 13 innings was just 38, and his 169 runs for the season came at an average of only 15.36. In 1962, Millman was England's incumbent Test wicketkeeper at the start of the season, and Rhodes played in several games as wicketkeeper as well as in some as a batsman only. This was his best season with the bat: he made 726 runs at an average of 23.41. But his aggregate and average were much bolstered by an innings of 132 in the game against Cambridge University. He made only one other score of more than 50: he scored 57 as an opener in the game against Derbyshire. Once Millman had lost his Test place, he played less and did not appear after the end of July. In 1963, Millman was both wicketkeeper and captain, and Rhodes played only one first-team match. There were a few more games in 1964, but he was not successful, failing to pass 50 in any innings, and at the end of the season his contract was not renewed.

Context Furness Abbey Station was situated at the southern end of the Furness Abbey complex. It served the nearby local attraction, the ruins of Furness Abbey, the Furness Abbey Hotel and the few houses and farms scattered about the general area. The Cistercian Way, which begins at Furness Abbey is a walking trail to Dalton-in-Furness made famous by the poet William Wordsworth. History The Furness Railway was authorised in 1844 to build a line which would link Kirkby-in-Furness with Dalton-in- Furness. The railway was extended in places and subsequently took over the Whitehaven and Furness Junction Railway and the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway. The station at Furness Abbey was opened in 1846 and began receiving passengers from further afield in 1862 (when the London and North Western Railway was directly linked). Passengers had already begun to travel from West Cumbria from 1850 (though the Furness company didn't formally lease the coast line from Whitehaven until 1865). Services Services stopped at Furness Abbey to allow passengers to use the Furness Abbey Hotel, owned by the railway company. All services north of Barrow had initially to travel back to Furness Abbey towards Dalton, where they reversed at Dalton Jcn and continued onto Askam. This practice eventually ceased in 1882, when the loop line to the new central Barrow station on Abbey Road was completed and trains could continue from there northwards to Askam without reversal. The station was closed by British Railways shortly after nationalisation, on 25 September 1950 and was subsequently demolished. No trace of the station now remains.Railscot - Photographs of Furness Abbey Railscot photo gallery; Retrieved 26 June 2017 References Bibliography  * External links *Site of Former Furness Abbey Station Category:Buildings and structures in Barrow-in-Furness Category:Former buildings and structures in Barrow-in-Furness Category:Disused railway stations in Cumbria Category:Former Furness Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1846 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1950 Category:1846 establishments in England ","title":"Furness Abbey railway station"},{"id":"40242555","text":"Qul Ali (, also Romanized as Q≈´l ‚ÄòAlƒ´ and Qowl ‚ÄòAlƒ´; also known as Gholali, Gol‚Äòalƒ´, KulƒÅlu, and Qol‚Äòalƒ´) is a village in Karasf Rural District, in the Central District of Khodabandeh County, Zanjan Province, Iran.

History  On 16 December 1971 Bangladesh won its independence from Pakistan through the Bangladesh Liberation war. There was mass rape during the Bangladesh Liberation war with an estimated 200,000-400,000 women were raped by Pakistan Army and their collaborators. On 22 December 1971 the Government of Bangladesh declared women who had been raped Birangona or war-heroine. President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman asked Bangladesh to \\"give due honor and dignity to the women oppressed by the Pakistani army\\" and called them his daughters. Yet many of them committed suicide, a section of them left the country to work as servants abroad, and a great many were killed in the hands of the unskilled mid-wives during abortion. This prompted the government to set up 'seba sadans' to give them clinical support. Kendrio Mohila Punorbashon Songstha was established in January 1972 to rehabilitate these violated women with the technical and humanitarian support from International Planned Parenthood, the International Abortion Research and Training Centre, and the Catholic Church. Later, the government provided them with vocational training and launched a campaign to get them married. Which led to accusations that Bangladesh was trying to hide the Birongonas. The Birangonas have often been ostracised by society and their family members. Women Rights activists have called for the Birangona to be declared Freedom Fighters (Mukti Bahini). Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association and Mitali Hossain filled a petition with Bangladesh High Court to upgrade the status of Birangona. On 27 January 2014, the High Court asked the government of Bangladesh why it should not be directed to do so. On January 2015 the parliament of Bangladesh approved a proposal to upgrade the status of Birangona to freedom fighter status. On 23 October 2015 Bangladesh government for the first time declared 43 Birangona, Freedom Fighters. Liberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Haque said that now they would enjoy the same government benefits as Freedom Fighters.

History  The Order of United Commercial Travelers was formed on January 16, 1888 by six men in a meeting at the Neil House in Columbus, Ohio to provide a society for traveling salesmen, or commercial travelers. The original objectives of the order were to aid its members and their dependents in financial and material matters, establish funds to indemnify members in case of disability or accidental death, establish a widows and orphans reserve fund and obtain just and equitable favors for traveling salesmen. The organization also wished to operate as a secret society, whose aim was to unite and raise the moral and social caliber of its members. In fact, in at one time referred to itself as \\"travelers masonry\\".Alvin J. Schmidt Fraternal Orders (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press), 1980, pp. 341 The new organization's officers adopted titles similar to those of other organizations of the day. Levi Pease was the first Supreme Counselor, John Fenimore was the first Supreme Junior Counselor, and Charles Flagg was the first Supreme Secretary. The sample case, a vital tool in the life of a commercial traveler, became the symbol of UCT. The original emblem of the organization consisted of a gold crescent with a sample case suspended within the points of the crescent. In 1956, the Order founded the UCT Fraternal Foundation which has yielded income to the Retarded Children Teachers Reserve Fund. Early in the Order history it paid out $25 a week to members disabled as the result of an accident, and beginning in 1894 it paid out $5,000 in accidental death benefits.Schmidt p.342 = 1891 = The Sample Case Magazine The Sample Case, the ‚Äúacknowledged mouthpiece and official organ of UCT‚Äù as stated on page one, made its debut May 15, 1891. The first issues were published on the first and 15th of the month. Subscription price was $1 and single issues 5 cents. Today, members receive a subscription to the quarterly magazine, which highlights community projects, volunteer opportunities, benefits and products, and local and regional council news. = 1899 = UCT Expands to Canada With the development of transcontinental rail in the late 1800s markets for many products expanded west and into Canada. Commercial travelers headed west and north to take advantage of these new markets. As they did, they took with them information about UCT and its membership benefits. Winnipeg Council 154 became the first UCT Canadian council in 1899.  Ritual  The order had a ritual that included an oath of secrecy, vows to aid other brothers and their dependents, obey the laws of their country and aid in caring for the sick, among other things. An older version included a vow to never violate the chastity of a maiden. The ritual included five lectures and was full of religious symbolism, with an altar and an open Bible.Schmidt pp.241-2  Membership In 1979 the Order was open to any male citizens of the United States, Canada or another North American British possession, aged eighteen to fifty five, who was of good moral character and in good physical and mental condition. At one point it was open only to whites. In 1948 it opened its membership to professionals and businessmen. In 1969 it has 240,000 members in 680 local Councils. In 1979 it 226,221 members in 670 councils in forty six states, the District of Columbia and ten Canadian provinces.Schmidt p.342 Membership is open to both men and women age 18 and above who have an interest in good citizenship and volunteering to improve their local communities. Members of local councils have the ability to direct volunteer efforts based on the needs of the local community.  Organization  Local units of the group are called \\"councils\\". Five Councils in a state or province can apply for a charter to form a \\"Grand Council\\". The first Grand Council was established in Ohio on May 26, 1889 and second was founded in Missouri in 1891. The highest authority is the \\"Supreme Council\\". Officers on the Grand and Supreme level are the same as those on the local level, except they add Grand or Supreme to their title respectively, ergo, a treasurer on the Grand level is a Grand Treasurer, on the Supreme level is a Supreme Treasurer, etc. There is also a side degree on the model of the Shriners called the Ancient Mystic Order of the Bagmen of Baghdad.Schmidt pp.341-2 = Local councils = Local councils are the foundation of UCT. Through volunteer service each local council works to support the needs of its community. Local council members plan and conduct meetings, organize events and enjoy social activities. Volunteers also serve as leaders. Councils nominate officers who are elected annually for a one-year term. They also nominate the executive committee, whose members are elected for two-year terms. Prospective members wishing to join UCT will be connected with a council closest to them. = Regional Councils = Providing leadership and direction to local councils are 29 regional and state councils in the U.S. and Canada. Regional councils help with local council operations, provide direction and form new councils. Officers are elected at the regional level and serve one-year terms. = Senior Management and Home Office Staff= The board hires the CEO who is responsible for the operations of UCT's home office. The CEO and the rest of the Senior Management team oversee insurance operations and Fraternal operations in the home office in Columbus and the Canadian office in Calgary. = Insurance Agents = Agents are members and active within local councils. They provide products based on the financial needs of individuals and families in their areas.

The Flyboard was the subject of a lawsuit from competitor Jetlev which was dropped without prejudice in March 2013. The device was presented to the public for the first time at the jet ski World Championship 2012 in China. Since its introduction in 2012 the Flyboard has sold around 2500 units. In the 2015 season of America's Got Talent, a flyboard enthusiast named Damone Rippy performed Flyboarding as his act on the show.

Zapata's company, Z-AIR, had received a ‚Ç¨1.3m grant from the French military in December 2018. However, he has said that the flyboard was not yet suitable for military use due to the noise it creates and the challenge of learning how to fly the device. In a France Inter radio interview, France's Minister of the Armed Forces Florence Parly said the flyboard might eventually be suitable, \\"for example as a flying logistical platform or, indeed, as an assault platform\\".

It is designed so that the PWC follows behind the rider‚Äôs trail, allowing the rider multiple degrees of freedom, even allowing the rider to go underwater if they desire. The pilot on the Flyboard is secured in by bindings similar to a wakeboard and the rider is propelled from water jets below the device. The Flyboard is buoyant for safety, which also allows the rider to rest in the water between rides.Explications Techniques, zapata-racing.com. Retrieved: 10 December 2013. The use of a personal flotation device and helmet is required by rental locations for safety purposes to protect against serious head trauma in the event of the rider impacting the PWC or stationary structures, and to protect the ears from damage and discomfort from impacts with the water. Device power is controlled by a throttle on the PWC. The equipment may be used in two modes: The primary one requires two people, one to control the PWC throttle which regulates the power and height of the rider. The secondary mode relies on an accessory called an Electronic Management Kit (EMK) which allows the rider to control the PWC throttle.

Context Lindal station was situated west of Station Road railway bridge just a short walk south of the main village and Ulverston Road. It served the local coal and iron ore mines in the local area, as well as the village and local candle factory. It was opened on 6 May 1851 by the Furness Railway on the Furness Line and was shortly connected to the London and North Western Railway at Lancaster. The station was closed on 1 October 1951 during a post-war cost cutting drive after nationalisation, by British Railways. No remains of the station are present today apart from Station Road bridge and an empty arch that used to pass the bay platform line to the east of the station. History The Furness Railway was authorised in 1844 to build a line which would link Kirkby-in-Furness with Dalton-in-Furness. The railway was extended in places and subsequently took over the Whitehaven and Furness Junction Railway and the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway. The station at Lindal was opened in 1846 and began receiving passengers from further afield in 1862 (when the London and North Western Railway was directly linked). Passengers had already begun to travel from West Cumbria from 1865. =Lindal railway incident= The hole that opened under the tracks at Lindal On Thursday 22 September 1892 near Lindal station, a large hole had appeared beneath the railway, taking many lines out of use and swallowing up a locomotive. Rescue attempts were abandoned and the locomotive still lies underground at an unknown depth. The cause of the hole has been debated but remains unclear to this day. The former site is situated on a wide embankment carrying only the two main lines that remain.  Services  Services ran regularly with workers trains supplementing the local and express passenger services.

It began as a small drapery business, John Barker & Company, founded by John Barker and James Whitehead in 1870. Barkers grew rapidly to become one of London's largest and most well-known department stores. The company played a significant role in establishing Kensington High Street as one of London's principal shopping destinations for most of the twentieth century. The business was purchased by House of Fraser in 1957. Barkers closed permanently in 2006. Part of the former flagship building now contains a branch of Whole Foods Market (2019). Early history In 1870 John Barker and James Whitehead opened a small drapery business at 91‚Äì93 Kensington High Street. James Whitehead (a city merchant) was the investor, while John Barker ran the store. John Barker's plan was to start small and grow his business to a full-line department store. He started by dealing direct with manufacturers to get the best price, and with the profits made he started buying up freeholds and leases of nearby properties. By the end of 1870 he had annexed 26‚Äì28 Ball Street, setting up millinery and dressmaking departments. By 1871, he had purchased 87 Kensington High Street and opened men's tailoring and children's outfitting departments. Within a year he had again grown by buying his neighbours' businesses at 89 Kensington High Street and 26 Ball Street. By 1880, he had extended his stores at 87‚Äì89 Kensington High Street and had bought an ironmongery business at 14‚Äì16 Ball Street and added 75‚Äì77 Kensington High Street and 12 Ball Street to his premises. By 1892, the business had swallowed up 63-71 Kensington High Street, 2‚Äì6 Young Street and 6 Ball Street and now operated over forty two departments and workshops. John Barker & Co Ltd In 1894, the business was incorporated with John Barker as the chairman of the board, joined by his brother Francis and H H Johnstone (both established partners in the firm), along with Tresham Gilbey (his son- in-law) and J G Barnes, the former manager of the Kensington branch of Parr's Banking Co. In the same year the business bought Seaman Little & Co, a large competitor, which had divided up the Barker premises. The company at this point had 33 shops, including sixteen fronting onto Kensington High Street.http://www.housoffrasearchive.ac.uk/company/?id=c0537 By this time the business had grown to 64 departments selling everything from clothes to groceries. It even had its own drug-dispensing department. By 1895 the company had purchased every property on the south side of Kensington High Street between King Street and Young Street, except for numbers 73 and 85, which the business would go on to acquire in 1900. New space allowed for the addition of jewellery, watch, and bicycle departments to the ever-growing assortment. In 1907 Barkers bought its near neighbour Ponting Brothers, but continued to run the store as a separate concern. In 1912, the earliest section of the Barkers store was devastated by fire. Temporary premises were located opposite whilst rebuilding was commenced by Barkers' own construction department in 1913. John Barker, the store's founder, died in 1914. He was replaced as chairman by Sidney Skinner, who had worked his way up in the firm after joining in 1889. The First World War devastated the Barkers business and activities were scaled back. After the war, the policy of expansion was resumed with the purchase of neighbouring competitor, Derry & Toms, in 1920. The store was located in between the Barkers and Pontings stores, and again was run as a separate entity. In 1924 the business opened new shops in Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester selling pianos and gramophones, but this venture proved a failure and the provincial branches were shut in 1926. More successful was the 1925 acquisition of Zeeta Cake Company, a high-class bakery and confectionery business, created in 1919 by a group of John Barker & Co directors. The purchase extended Barkers' own already well-established catering operations and eventually up to twenty Zeeta branches would be opened in the London area. A large new furniture building at 26-40 Kensington High Street was opened in 1926. The site had previously been occupied by the temporary home of a number of departments following the fire of 1912, with the freehold acquired by the company in 1919. 1930 to 1957 The Barkers sign, still visible on the building During the 1930s the company started ambitious work to rebuild both the Barkers and Derry & Toms stores in a phased development. This plan included building over Ball Street and moving the frontages of the stores back some 30 feet to assist in the widening of Kensington High Street. At the same time Pontings' store was extended along Wrights Lane. The buildings were designed by in-house architect Bernard George, with the new Derry & Toms store opening in 1933. Barkers' redevelopment, however, was interrupted by the Second World War, and was not finally completed until 1958. Despite bomb damage to Derry & Toms, the Barker businesses maintained profits during the war and continued to grow. In 1947 the old-established drapery business of Gosling & Sons in Richmond was purchased. The possibility of buying Selfridges, Oxford Street, was seriously explored in 1951. Further growth was realised with the purchase of Dale & Kerley in Terminus Road, Eastbourne, in 1953. House of Fraser ownership In August 1957, House of Fraser bought the business and soon began a programme of rationalisation. Between 1959 and 1962 the Zeeta shops were disposed of along with surplus properties on Kensington High Street and Young Street. In 1965 the construction and decorating department of the business was formally incorporated as John Barker (Construction & Development) Ltd, while in 1968 the Richmond business of Gosling & Sons was closed to allow for the construction of a new Dickins & Jones store on the site, completed in 1970. By 1971, the business was further downsized by the closure of the Pontings store and the sale of its freehold. The entire Pontings stock was transferred to the lower ground floor of Barkers which became known as Ponting's Bargain Basement. In the same year the freehold of Derry & Toms' building was sold to British Land, though Derry & Toms would continue to trade until 1973. In 1972, following the accommodation of Pontings' business, a refurbishment of the main Barker store was carried out to allow for the absorption of Derry & Toms' trade. In 1973, House of Fraser purchased the Army & Navy Stores group. Barkers of Kensington became a flagship store of Army & Navy whilst always retaining the Barkers name. Between 1976 and 1978 the store was further refurbished, with a revised food hall, new china and glass departments, first floor fashion department, installation of automatic lifts, and the closure of the Pontings basement, to be replaced by new hardware and electrical departments. In 1982, the store was downsized from seven to four floors and architects were commissioned to redesign the site. The redeveloped Barkers building was completed in 1986 with lettable office space taking the largest area. In addition, the reconfigured building incorporated garden terraces, an arcade of small shops on the ground floor and a much reduced Barkers department store. The formal company of John Barker & Co Ltd was wound up voluntarily by House of Fraser in 1988. Trading at Barkers continued until 2006. The 135-year-old store was closed as part of a further rationalisation of the House of Fraser business.The story of John Barker & Co Ltd, Kensington, London. University of Glasgow: Archive services.

The 702d Strategic Missile Wing was activated on 1 January 1959, and the first Douglas C-124 Globemaster II with a Snark arrived on 27 May 1959.http://www.emmitsburg.net/archive_list/articles/misc/cww/2011/snark.htm The complex had 6 corrugated hangars (\\"missile assembly and maintenance buildings\\") each of with 2 fixed outdoor launch pads. For each launch pad with diameter , a missile was stored within the building on a launcher trailer attached to a tow vehicle, 1 at ready storage to launch from the outdoor pad within 15 minutes and behind it, 1 capable of launch in 30 minutes. Each building had 3 additional missiles in line behind the first wave (readiness of 4 hr, 3 days, and 5 days), and the missile launch control center was a hangar balcony. In addition to the hangars and pads, the complex included \\"a jet engine run-up building, the warhead maintenance and inspection building, missile maintenance and guidance lab\\", a dormitory for night alert personnel, and a compressor house for each hangar. First alert status was 18 March 1960, and 30 missiles were available in December with 4 on alert. After the 702d SMW was declared operational on 28 February 1961, 20 Snarks were on alert in the summer of 1961, and on 25 June 1961 the wing was inactivated following President Kennedy's earlier announcement for \\"73 military establishments\\" to be closed (Congress was informed on 30 March.) Civilian use after base closure The Snark Missile Launch Complex was purchased by the city of Presque Isle, Maine, in early 1962 for $56,000 (the city also bought \\"other parts of the former Presque Isle Air Force Base, ...known as the Skyway Industrial Park\\" in 1962) and some of the remaining AFB area was redesignated \\"Presque Isle Air National Guard Facility\\". Four of the hangars were used for woodworking in 1962 and in 1995, one was used as a flax mill. The former launch complex now has the designation Environmental site ME500.

In California, the original \\"Atlas 576 SMS ICBM pad\\" with gantry became the Vandenberg AFB ABRES complex in September 1964 to launch ICBMs for reentry vehicle (RV) testing (moved from the Eastern Test Range). For the Green River site, Operations The 1st Athena launch was February 10, 1964, from Pad 2 which failed \\"and fell near Durango, Colo\\" (cf. the Pershing launched November 1964 that landed near Creede, Colorado) and the 2nd firing in May \\"was destroyed shortly after launch.\\" On July 8, 1964, the 1st \\"successful Athena/ABRES test missile\\" from the site landed at WSMR (at night for optical tracking of reentry).

The ballot measure, titled Measure O, presents to the electorate for its consideration an ordinance that proposes various legislative changes that would lift the ban on oil drilling within the City, to allow an oil drilling and production project proposed by E&B; Natural Resources Management Corp. to go forward at the site of the City Maintenance Yard at 555 Sixth Street, a development agreement, as well as an oil and gas pipeline franchise. The question appeared on the ballot to which voters chose a ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù answer to the following: \\"Shall E&B; Corporation‚Äôs 34 well oil and gas drilling/production project at the City‚Äôs 555 Sixth Street maintenance yard be approved by 1) amending the General Plan and Municipal Code to exempt the project from the City‚Äôs oil drilling ban and repeal the restriction on City‚Äôs use of project royalties, 2) awarding a pipeline franchise to transport oil/gas underground, 3) approving a 34 year development agreement, and 4) determining that project financial benefits outweigh its unavoidable environmental impacts?\\" http://www.hermosabch.org/index.aspx?page=739 In preparation for the election, the City of Hermosa Beach prepared an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) in compliance with the Environmental Quality Act, as well as a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Health Impact Assessment (HIA), and provided an extensive community education and review process.http://www.hermosabch.org/index.aspx?page=738 E&B; Natural Resources, the company behind the proposed Oil Drilling and Production Project, looks to access oil fields located offshore from a single onshore location using directional drilling technology. The proposed project is the result of a recently resolved legal battle between the city and the Macpherson Energy Corporation, in which Macpherson sued the city for damages over a previous plan that the city backed out of. The plan has been met with controversy, as residents are divided over the promise of an economic windfall versus potential health and environmental impacts on the community. Background: History of the Proposed Oil Drilling Project A complete summary of important dates surrounding cases regarding Oil Drilling in Hermosa Beach can be accessed through the following link located on the City of Hermosa Beach website: http://www.hermosabch.org/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=1660. The current proposal from E&B; Natural Resources to recover oil in Hermosa Beach is the result of a series of voter-approved initiatives and legal settlements stretching back to 1984. Following voter approval of two initiatives to allow for oil drilling at this site in 1984, the City Council approved an agreement and a 35-year lease with Macpherson Oil Company to recover oil from the huge oil reservoir underneath the City. In 1995, voters reversed their previous approval and Macpherson then sued the City for more than $700 million. To put that number into perspective, Hermosa Beach‚Äôs annual budget is about $30 million. After losing at trial and prior to the start of the damages trial, the City hired jury experts who conducted independent ‚ÄúMock Trials‚Äù to determine the amount of damages a jury might award Macpherson. The mock jurors awarded Macpherson hundreds of millions of dollars. A copy of these mock jury decisions can be found online at the City of Hermosa Beach‚Äôs website. A judgment of this size against Hermosa Beach would have bankrupted the City. Following the advice of the City Attorney, outside legal counsel and the jury experts, the City negotiated a settlement that included the payment of $30 million to Macpherson. At this point E&B; stepped in and paid $12.5 million to Macpherson and received their rights to the project, plus E&B; loaned the City their share of the settlement payment ‚Äì $17.5 million. The settlement called for E&B; to submit an application to the City that would include an exhaustive Environmental Impact Report as well as other financial and community studies. Following their review, the City will submit to the voters a new proposal to allow the safe recovery of oil from the same site. You can review the City‚Äôs overview of the project‚Äôs history on the ‚ÄúProposed Oil Production Project‚Äù section of the City‚Äôs website. If the voters reject the proposal, the City will be required to repay the $17.5 million loan (plus interest) it received from E&B; to pay its share of the settlement. If the proposed oil recovery project is approved, E&B; will forgive $14 million and allow the balance to be paid from the City‚Äôs royalties from the oil produced. Background: Macpherson Energy vs City Of Hermosa In 1992, Hermosa Beach granted an operating lease to the Macpherson Energy Company allowing them to use directional drilling to tap into underwater oil reserves off-shore from a single site located in the cities maintenance yard. As the company was preparing for the project, the City voted in 1995 to approve Proposition E, which restored a previously held ban on drilling. Since the agreement was in place before the vote, Hermosa moved ahead with the project. In 1998, following a report by the California Coastal Commission that raised safety concerns regarding the project, City Council voted to halt the project. Citing damages in lost revenue, Macpherson sued the city. After 14 years of litigation, on March 2, 2012, the Hermosa Beach City Council entered into a settlement agreement to end the lawsuit. The SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE was made by and between MACPHERSON OIL COMPANY, a California corporation and WINDWARD ASSOCIATES, a California limited partnership (collectively ‚ÄúMacpherson‚Äù), E & B NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT CORPORATION, a California corporation (‚ÄúE & B‚Äù), and the CITY OF HERMOSA BEACH a California municipal corporation (‚ÄúCity‚Äù). http://www.hermosabch.org/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=1662. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, E & B Natural Resources Management Corp. paid Macpherson Oil Co. $30 million for those rights, including Macpherson Oil Co.‚Äôs existing Conditional Use Permit and an oil and gas lease. E & B Natural Resources Management Corp. also would secure payment from the city of up to $17.5 million based on the results of a future election. At that election, which is scheduled for March 3, 2015, Hermosa Beach voters will review a ballot measure, titled Measure O, and decide whether to repeal the existing ban on oil drilling in the city limits and enter into a development agreement for E & B Natural Resources Management Corp. to complete what it describes as a ‚Äústate-of-the-art‚Äù oil drilling project at the city‚Äôs maintenance yard. http://www.hermosabch.org/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=1658 If the project is turned down by the voters, Hermosa would have to pay E&B; Natural Resources the full amount of the loan. Project scope E&B; Natural Resources has proposed a 30-35 year project that involves four phases: * Phase 1: Site Preparation. Phase 1 looks to construct revamp the project site by constructing new buildings to house equipment * Phase 2: Oil Drilling & Testing. Phase 2 looks to conduct tests on the wells to provide an accurate picture of the potential productivity and economic viability of the project * Phase 3: Final Design & Construction. Phase 3 utilizes the information collected in Phase 2 to create a final drilling program, acquire necessary equipment, and construct production facilities. * Phase 4: Development Drilling & Operation. Phase 4 involves the bulk of oil recovery from the reservoir. In addition, sound attenuation walls will be constructed to reduce noise. Since E&B; Natural Resources will be using directional drilling for this project, traditional offshore drilling platforms will not be necessary for recovery. The process of Hydraulic Fracturing, or ‚Äúfracking‚Äù, will also not be used, as the oil field provides naturally occurring characteristics that make the fracking unnecessary. Berkeley Research Group Director William Hamm completed a study that estimated that the City of Hermosa would receive $519 million of total economic benefit from the project, a figure that was quickly criticized by opponents of the project as speculative and unreliable since it is based on a study paid for by E&B.; Public response The residents of Hermosa Beach are very strongly divided on the merits of reversing its ban on oil drilling within the city limits.https://articles.latimes.com/2013/jul/25/local/la-me-ln-hermosa- oil-20130725 In the past year, the City of Hermosa Beach has held several public meetings on the project's EIR, as well as upon the health and economic impacts of the project. Advocates against oil drilling have rallied loudly against overturning the city's ban since early last year, citing the inescapable health and environmental concerns attached to such a project.http://www.dailybreeze.com/environment-and-nature/20140216/reports- oil-spills-smelly-air-and-health-threats-possible-downsides-of-hermosa-beach- oil-drilling-proposal A local advocacy group, Keep Hermosa Hermosa, has actively campaigned against undoing the city's current law banning oil drilling, and has become a significant political advocacy group in the city.https://www.facebook.com/StopHermosaBeachOil E&B; promises a windfall in profits to the community and contends that it is able to mitigate the health, environmental, and aesthetic concerns of the community, though the EIR released in April 2014 demonstrates that not all of the community's concerns can be completely mitigated.http://www.hermosabch.org/index.aspx?page=699 The estimated revenue to the city is projected to be approximately $500 million or more, according to the oil company.http://www.dailybreeze.com/general- news/20130306/hermosa-beach-would-earn-500-million-from-proposed-drilling- project-oil-company-says Some residents are concerned with the payback of the $17,500,000 loan to E&B; if the project does not pass by the voters. It may be possible that it is for this reason that some residents are in favor of the project, though the city manager of the City of Hermosa Beach has also publicly stated that a vote \\"no\\" on this proposal will not bankrupt the city, as it has sizable cash reserves and an excellent credit rating. The financial impact on the city is a consideration for many, as one recent quote from a former city councilman suggests. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm truly agnostic about what voters choose to do,‚Äù said former Mayor Kit Bobko, who helped negotiated the deal with the two companies. ‚ÄúMy primary concern in this is extracting us from this litigation, which is potentially ruinous.‚Äù References External links * City of Hermosa Beach: Proposed Oil Drilling and Production website * E&B; Natural Resources: Hermosa Oil Recovery Project website ** E&B; Natural Resources: Hermosa Beach Oil Recovery Project Facts and History * Committee Against Hermosa Beach Oil Drilling * Keep Hermosa Hermosa Oil drilling Category:Petroleum in California Category:Environmental issues in California Category:History of Los Angeles County, California Category:South Bay, Los Angeles ","title":"Hermosa Beach oil drilling controversy"},{"id":"40243203","text":"Lisa Anne Callif (born January 6, 1974) is an American entertainment attorney specializing in independent film.

However, a physical examination performed by the Brewers diagnosed Covey with Type I diabetes. He, instead, chose to enroll at the University of San Diego, near his Pasadena, California, home, and played college baseball for the San Diego Toreros prior to being selected by the Oakland Athletics. Career =Amateur career= Covey attended Maranatha High School in Pasadena, California, where he played for the school's baseball team. He pitched to a 1.30 earned run average (ERA) and a .131 batting average against in his four years at Maranatha.

History  The Artisans Order of Mutual Protection was founded by Civil war medical examiner Dr. James Bunn, his Supervisor Dr. Matson and Mr. McMurray. Dr. Bunn had also help found the Ancient Order of United Workmen. Preliminary meetings on the idea of a fraternal benefit society that would be more satisfactory in terms of benefits for the working man were first held by this group in 1867. This group met again in 1872 in St. Louis MO. At this meeting Dr. Bunn unveiled the rituals of the order and administered an oath to those in attendance to keep it secret. Another convention was held in Washington, DC in 1873 and Dr. Bunn was given the title of the \\"Most Excellent Master Artisan\\". Bunn was authorized to institute assemblies and start to recruit new members into the Order. The charter was signed on May 1st 1873. In its early years the Order had had a lengthy ritual that was heavily influenced by Freemasonry. This ritual had been set up by Mr. McMurray. It worked three degrees - Endentured Apprentice, fellow Workman and Perfect Artisan. The rituals lengths and derivativeness led to some controversy within the organization and it was shortened. The shortened version was kept essentially unchanged into the 1970s. The Artisans are the oldest fraternal benefit society of its kind in the United States.Alvin J. Schmidt Fraternal Orders (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press), 1980, pp.44-5Bryan C. Werner, Director A.O.M.P.  Organization  The Order has a two level structure. Local units where the members meet on a monthly basis are called \\"Assemblies\\". The national body that meets every two years at a semi-annual convention is called the Most Excellent Assembly. The Most Excellent Assembly meets on a semi-annual basis and it is the body that governs the entire organization. This semi-annual convention is a gathering of elected delegates from the local Assemblies and permanent delegates. Officers and Directors are elected at this meeting as well as the business of the main office and local assemblies being discussed. The Most Excellent Master Artisan is elected at this convention to a two-year term. The Master Artisan is the President of the organization and his/her duties are to make sure that the fraternal end of the organization is running well and all the rules are being followed by the Assemblies. The national office is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This office is run by the General Manager and the G.M. is the person who handles the day-to-day operations of the business. Term and whole life insurance policies as well as annuities are available for purchase at the Artisans main office. A junior department was founded in 1933 for young males aged thirty days to eighteen years old. Junior membership is now open to all male and female children. This department is almost entirely insurance oriented. A women's department with its own assemblies was established in 1955. Some assemblies are still just for male or female members but many are now co-ed.Schmidt p.45  Membership  The Order had 30,000 members by 1930. In the 1950s the combined junior and adult organizations reached a high of 36,000. This dropped off to 32,000 in 1967 and 26,000 in 1978. As of 2017 the organization had approximately 6000 members. Schmidt p.45  Ritual  Every adult member who joins the order is required to go through an initiation ceremony, including taking an obligation. There are still Masonic influences, such as the use of a white apron.Schmidt p.45  See also  *Travelers Protective Association of America *List of North American fraternal benefit orders  References   Further reading  *\\"History of the Artisans Order of Mutual Protection\\" in The Artisan May 1948 *Borden, Elias H, A century of fraternalism and protection, 1873-1973: a history of one hundred years of peace, power, protection, with the Artisans Order of Mutual Protection and the Most Excellent Assembly of the Artisans Order of Mutual Protection [Philadelphia?] : [Artisans Order of Mutual Protection?], 1973  External links  * Category:Fraternal orders Category:Organizations established in 1872 Category:1872 establishments in the United States ","title":"Artisans Order of Mutual Protection"},{"id":"40243410","text":"Nogometni klub Grafiƒçar Ljubljana (), commonly referred to as NK Grafiƒçar or simply Grafiƒçar, was a Slovenian football club from Ljubljana.

Its old main building on Hans Bogbinders All√©, opposite the Catholic St. Anne's Church, is no longer used for hospital purposes. History The hospital was founded by a community of Sisters of Saint Elizabeth which had been present in Copenhagen since 1895 where they were involved in outpatient nursing. The foundation stone was set on 1 October 1904 and the hospital was inaugurated, with 60 beds, on 30 October 1905. The architect was Emil J√∏rgensen who also designed a church on the other side of the street. It was replaced by the current St. Anne's Church in 1938. The Grey Nuns operated the hospital until 1 April 1970 when it was taken over by Copenhagen County. On 1 April 1997 Copenhagen County's St. Elizabeth's Hospital was merged with Copenhagen Municipality's Sundby Hospital to form Amager Hospital. In 2010, Region Hovedstaden announced that St. Elizabeth's old buildings would either be sold off or rented out for other use. Architecture The hospital building is built in red brick to a National Romantic style with details in granite, chalk and soapstone. The hospital was expanded in 1924 and 1932.

The system was installed on a total of six ships starting in 1957. The US Navy purchased a prototype CDS and produced twenty of their own version, the Electronic Data System (EDS). These were used on a number of ships until 1968. A modified version, the Data Handling System, was used with the AMES Type 82 radar by the Royal Air Force, and US Air Force very nearly used it as well. The CDS allowed operators to assign objects on the radar display different IDs and combined them together onto a single display which allowed intercept officers to have a unified display of location, raid size, and altitude. The CDS made it easy for operators to vector friendly fighters onto intercept courses with unknown targets and later versions could automatically calculate the interception points. The basic idea of the CDS was extremely influential in military circles and led to computerized versions in the form of DATAR, Naval Tactical Data System, and SAGE. The trackball (known as \\"ball tracker\\" at the time) was invented by Ralph Benjamin as part of his work for the CDS in 1946. The prototype, named roller ball, was patented in 1947, but kept as a secret inside the military. It laid the foundation to input devices such as the computer mouse. Production units used a joystick in place of the trackball. History HMS Victorious was the first ship to use the CDS. The Type 984 radar that fed data to the CDS can be seen mounted in front of the funnel. =Initial work= In the post-war era, Elliott Brothers began concentrating on automation solutions for fire control, and on 1 December 1946 they began work on what would develop into the CDS. The initial idea was to collect ASDIC data on various targets from different ships in a task group and then produce a single unified view using a new display system that overlaid symbols on a large-format plan-position indicator (PPI) radar display. Elliott received a patent for this \\"Peevish\\" system in 1947. Although the initial concept was to net ASDIC data, in 1947 attention turned to the aircraft plotting problem. This was due to a new effort to develop a powerful 3D radar system that was designed to replace a series of previous designs. Eventually known as the Type 984 radar, it would so greatly increase the amount of data available that plotting it all was seen as a serious concern. The first complete system for the aircraft role was demonstrated at Elliott's Borehamwood research center in June 1950. This eventually led to a contract for two prototype versions; the original prototype was delivered as \\"X1\\" to the Admiralty Research Establishment in Witley in 1951, and a second newly built model, \\"X2\\", which was paid for by the US Navy's Bureau of Ships but officially on permanent loan to the US Naval Research Laboratory. =Royal Navy use= At first, there was no pressing need for the CDS, and production was not undertaken. However, the development of the Seaslug missile set off a series of events that led to the introduction of CDS some years later. In order to support Seaslug, Type 984 would be needed in order to give enough warning time to launch the missile. The 984 covered a huge area, out to hundreds of kilometres against high-flying targets. It was also very large and could only be carried by the largest ships, too big for the s that would carry Seaslug. The initial 1955 plans for Seaslug called for two types of ships to carry it, a large cruiser and a medium-sized destroyer. Although the cruiser could fit the 984 with relative ease, design studies showed that the destroyers could carry Seaslug and 4.5-inch guns, or Seaslug and Type 984, or Type 984 and 4.5-inch guns; but not all three. Given the missions being considered for the destroyers, the gun armament was regarded as at least as important as the missiles. The solution was offered by the CDS. With the addition of the new Digital Picture Transmission system (DPT), a single ship carrying Type 984 and CDS could pass off information to any ship with an output display and the DPT radio equipment. This allowed destroyers to get their initial cueing from the 984 while being positioned some distance away, which was important given the fairly short range of Seaslug. When the missile cruiser design was cancelled, this need became more pressing. Pye Ltd. was given the production contract. The first such system was installed in 1957 on which was undergoing an extensive post-war refit. The fitment demonstrated that in spite of the requirement for manual input, the system greatly improved data access compared to older methods. The capability of the system was shown off in spectacular fashion when Victorious returned to duty in 1958 and operated against US aircraft in war games. In spite of the US planner's best efforts to overwhelm the ship's directors, Victorious was able to track and intercept everything they sent against it. This was followed with the CDS being fit to the new and the first batch of four of the eight County-class destroyers. Unknown to the developers of the original CDS, another division within Elliott was developing a purely electronic version of the same basic concept, the Action Data Automation, and a developed version of this system would ultimately replace the original model on most RN ships. =British Army and RAF= Starting in 1949, the British Army began development of a new tactical control radar that would provide early warning and putting-on information for sixteen dispersed batteries of anti-aircraft artillery spread over a city-wide area. This presented the same sort of problem as the Navy faced with its dispersed destroyers; the AA guns had small radars on-site, but these did not provide a long-range picture of the battle as a whole. They learned of the CDS and became interested in adapting it for the new radar. During development, in 1953 the role of air defence over the UK passed from the Army to the Royal Air Force, who took up development and renamed the radar AMES Type 82. In this role, the renamed Data Handling System (DHS) was somewhat more complex, consisting of separate operators to handle initial detection and picking out tracks that were interesting, then handing off those tracks to detail trackers who continued fine-tracking of the targets. A third set of operators handed separate height-finding radars (if used) and the identification friend-or-foe interrogators, feeding that information into the system on a less frequent basis. Those detailed tracks could then be sent to the AA sites, where the data could automatically cue, or \\"lay-on\\", their local radars. The Type 82 was used in its intended military role for only a short period, before being passed off to mixed military/civilian air traffic control role in the midlands. In this role, the DHS proved invaluable in handling large numbers of aircraft movements. The system remained in service into the 1980s. =US Navy development= The US Navy was \\"wowed\\" by the demonstration CDS when they visited Borehamwood in 1950. This led to the construction of the X2 model, which arrived at the Naval Research Center in 1952. X2 \\"did much to sell the concept\\" of the CDS, but they found many details that concerned them. Foremost was its size, which would limit it to larger ships. They were more interested in a system that could be used on a large portion of the fleet. They also found it to be sensitive to changes in temperature, lacking precision, and given its large number of moving parts, difficult to maintain. A final problem was that they desired a system capable of tracking hundreds of objects and adding the additional channels to the CDS would be expensive. This led to their own version, the Electronic Data System. This was very similar to the original CDS but included a number of detail changes. Happy with the results, in 1955 the Bureau of Ships sent a contract to Motorola to build 20 EDS systems. The first was installed on in 1956, then on the four ships of Destroyer Division 262, and as well as a selection of guided missile cruisers. During tests in 1959, the ships of 262 were able to exchange data using the SSA-21 at ranges up to . Most of these units remained in use through the 1960s, finally being replaced in 1968 by the Navy Tactical Data System. =USAF interest= The prototype CDS was also viewed by the US Air Force, who were at that time exploring their needs for air plotting. They were already involved in the project that would ultimately emerge as the all-digital SAGE system but were exploring alternatives as well. One of these was proposed by the University of Michigan's Willow Run Research Center, who suggested adding a data transmission system to CDS. Ultimately the Air Force continued with the original SAGE development, who's AN/FSQ-7 computers were the largest ever built. Description =\\"X\\" versions= The CDS system had several layers of input that constructed the overall air picture. This started with operators sitting at conventional radar displays that had been equipped with a joystick. The joystick's internal potentiometers produced a changing voltage in X and Y as the stick moved. These signals were sent to the deflection plates of a separate channel in the cathode ray tube display, overlaying a dot on the existing radar imagery to provide a cursor. Along the side of the display was a series of buttons that allowed the operator to indicate that they had placed the cursor on one of up to eight targets. Data was collected by the Coordinated Display Equipment (CDE). Inside the CDE, a telephone stepper switch was used to periodically connect to each of the operator's displays in turn. Depending on which button was being held down on the input console at that time, the switch connected the operator's joystick to one of 96 pairs of servomotors connected to potentiometers. The voltage from the joystick drove the servomotor to rotate the CDE's internal potentiometer to match the value of the one in the joystick, thereby copying its value. The value of those internal potentiometers was also sent back to the input consoles, creating a \\"blip\\" on the screen that matched the underlying radar data, but did not move. The operators could then see how much the target had moved since they last updated the CDE, and then prioritize which ones they wanted to update. In the prototype versions, there were only three input stations allowing a total of 24 targets to be tracked, but they could also read up to eight more inputs from external sources, nominally data from other ships. A production version would have more input stations to fully expand the capabilities of the CDE. In addition to the encoding potentiometers, the CDE also contained a series of ten-position uniselector switches that were used to encode additional numerical information for each input. These included a two-digit track number, a single digit indicating high, medium or low altitude, a digit indicating whether it was friendly, hostile or unidentified and another indicating whether it was a single aircraft, a small group or a large formation. The output from the CDE was sent to a separate large-format plan-position indicator (PPI) display. By rapidly cycling through the potentiometers, the beam in the display caused a series of spots to appear on the screen, representing the location of the (up to) 96 targets. The operator could select different sets of targets to display, only the high altitude ones for instance, or only friendly aircraft. The prototypes also included a \\"conference display\\", a Photographic Display Unit that updated once every 15 seconds and was large enough to allow multiple operators to view the same imagery. Initially, the system considered using a multi-coloured disk that was spun in front of the PPI display, timed so symbols would be drawn while a particular colour was over the display. This concept, which was common in early mechanical television systems of the era, would allow different symbols to have different colours. When this method was found to be impractical, the concept changed to use different symbols instead. This used a series of ten symbols to represent a different group number. The number of aircraft was indicated by increasingly filling in the symbol, and the altitude by placing a line to the right of the symbol that was a dot for low altitude, half the height of the symbol for medium, and the entire height for high. For instance, if track 41, which puts it in group 4, was a small group of aircraft flying at medium altitude, it would appear as a triangle (the symbol for group 4) with the right half filled in to indicate a small group, and a medium-height bar to the right of it indicating medium altitude. The track number and altitude in \\"angels\\" was displayed to the upper and lower left of the symbol. =Production models= The original CDS concept used a complex set of motors and potentiometers to encode data, which was difficult to keep running properly. Pye's solution for the production version was to replace these with capacitors that stored a voltage corresponding to the position of the joystick. Since the voltage slowly leaked out of the capacitors, the system used a memory refresh system to keep it accurate. This greatly improved the availability of the system. The production version used a simplified display system that removed the symbols. In their place, the original radar blip was displayed, but surrounded by additional data in the form of two-digit numbers. The track number remained in the upper left, but the altitude moved to the lower right. In the upper right was the store number, the local set of registers storing this track. This allowed the system to have a global track number across the task force while each receiving CDS could assign it to a different local ID. In the lower right was the category in the first digit and the size (single, small group, large formation; 1, 2, 3) in the second. A later addition was the ability to track the velocity of the targets, a concept taken from the US work on their X2 model. This used an integrating circuit to measure the difference in position between subsequent measurements of any given track. This information was also fed to a separate analog computer that automatically calculated intercept locations, making the plotting of multiple intercepts much easier. This version also added additional inputs that transmitted readiness information from the aircraft carriers and missile cruisers, allowing the intercept officers to choose what weapons to assign to a given target. This information was passed from ship to ship using a new data link known as the Digital Plot Transmission (DPT) system that could also share the tracks. Production models varied in size and capacity. The unit fit to the Victorious held 48 tracks, the Hermes had less room so its system held 32, and the systems in the County Class held 24. =EDS= To address the mechanical reliability issues seen in the X2, in 1953 the NRL adapted their CDS to store data using capacitors instead of the potentiometers, a change that would later be copied by the production CDS. This left the input consoles as the only major moving parts. They further modified their units by replacing the trackball with an electrically conductive sheet of glass which the user pressed on with a metal probe. The assembly was then placed on top of the otherwise unchanged input station display. An additional change to the central unit added a second set of capacitors for each channel. With each sampling of the channels in the input units, the values were read into the alternating set of capacitors in the CDE. This caused the change in position between scans to be recorded. On the display, the values of these two measurements were rapidly cycled, causing the dots to elongate into short dashes, directly indicating the direction and speed of travel. Finally, they added the AN/SSA-21 unit, which read out the values and sent them as teletype signals to other ships, where they could be converted back to analog signals for display there. Many of these changes also appeared in the production versions of the CDS, which differed primarily in the input method.

Admired for its cleanliness as well as for being loved by Muhammad, the cat is considered \\"the quintessential pet\\" by Muslims.  Origins of reverence  Cats have been venerated in the Near East since antiquity, a tradition adopted by Islam, albeit in a much modified form. According to many hadith, Muhammad prohibited the persecution and killing of cats. One of Muhammad's companions was known as Abu Hurairah (literally: \\"Father of the Kitten\\") for his attachment to cats. Abu Hurairah claimed that he had heard Muhammad declare that a woman went to Hell for starving a female kitten and not providing her with any water. According to legend, Abu Saeed's cat saved Muhammad from a snake.  History  Cat resting on a pillow next to an imam in Cairo, by John Frederick Lewis The American poet and travel author Bayard Taylor (1825‚Äì1878) was astonished when he discovered a Syrian hospital where cats roamed freely. The institution, in which domestic felines were sheltered and nourished, was funded by a waqf, along with caretakers' wages, veterinary care and cat food. Edward William Lane (1801‚Äì1876), a British Orientalist who resided in Cairo, described a cat garden originally endowed by the 13th-century Egyptian sultan Baibars, whose European contemporaries held a very different attitude towards cats, eating them or killing them under papal decrees. Wilfred Thesiger, in his book The Marsh Arabs, notes that cats were allowed free entry to community buildings in villages in the Mesopotamian Marshes, and even fed.Thesiger, Wilfried. The Marsh Arabs : Longman : London, 1964 Aside from protecting granaries and food stores from pests, cats were valued by the paper-based Arab-Islamic cultures for preying on mice that destroyed books. For that reason, cats are often depicted in paintings alongside Islamic scholars and bibliophiles. The medieval Egyptian zoologist Al-Damiri (1344‚Äì1405) wrote that the first cat was created when God caused a lion to sneeze, after animals on Noah's Ark complained of mice.  Hygiene and neutering  In Islamic tradition, cats are admired for their cleanliness. They are thought to be ritually clean, and are thus allowed to enter homes and even mosques, including Masjid al-Haram. Food sampled by cats is considered halal, in the sense that their consumption of the food does not make it impermissible for Muslims to eat, and water from which cats have drunk is permitted for wudu. Furthermore, there is a belief among some Muslims that cats seek out people who are praying. Muslim scholars are divided on the issue of neutering animals. Most, however, maintain that neutering cats is allowed \\"if there is some benefit in neutering the cat and if that will not cause its death\\". Muhammad ibn al Uthaymeen, a 20th-century Saudi Arabian Sunni imam, preached:  Muezza  A man teasing a cat with misbaha in Al-Azhar Mosque in Cairo According to Islamic tradition, Muezza (or Mu øizza; ) was Muhammad's favorite cat. Muhammad awoke one day to the sounds of the adhan. Preparing to attend prayer, he began to dress himself; however, he soon discovered his cat Muezza sleeping on the sleeve of his prayer robe. Rather than wake her, he used a pair of scissors to cut the sleeve off, leaving the cat undisturbed. Another story is, upon returning from the mosque, Muhammad received a bow from Muezza. He then smiled and gently stroked his beloved cat three times.

Neurosurgeons can use ShuntCheck flow results along with other diagnostic tests to assess shunt function and malfunction. Hydrocephalus is a condition in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulates in the brain, potentially leading to brain damage and death. It is corrected by a shunt which drains excess CSF from the brain to the abdomen. Shunts fail, typically by obstruction ‚Äì a life-threatening medical condition requiring the surgical replacement of the shunt. The symptoms of shunt failure are non-specific ‚Äì headache, nausea, lethargy ‚Äì so diagnostic tests must be conducted to rule in or rule out surgery. Current methods of diagnosing shunt malfunction, including CT Scan, MRI, radionuclide studies and shunt tap, have limitations and risks. These limitations and risks led to the development of ShuntCheck.Madsen JR, et al, Evaluation of the ShuntCheck Noninvasive Thermal Technique for Shunt Flow Detection in Hydrocephalic Patients, Neurosurgery 68:198-205, 2011Brenner DJ, Hall EJ, Computed Tomography ‚Äì An Increasing Source of Radiation Exposure, N Engl J Med 2007;357:2277-84Iskandar, B., et al., Pitfalls in the diagnosis of ventricular shunt dysfunction: radiology reports and ventricular size.

Technical note, J Neurosurg 1981 Apr,54(4):556-8Neff S, Measurement of flow in cerebrospinal fluid in shunts by transcutaneous thermal convection, J Neurosurg (Pediatrics 4) 103:366-373, 2005 to detect flow. The ShuntCheck sensor, a high-tech skin thermometer, is placed over the shunt where it crosses the clavicle. The shunt, which lies just below the skin, is cooled with an ice pack placed ‚Äúupstream‚Äù of the sensor. If CSF is flowing through the shunt, the cooled fluid will move ‚Äúdownstream‚Äù and the ShuntCheck sensor will detect a drop in temperature. Faster shunt flow results in greater temperature decreases. If the shunt is not flowing, the cooled fluid remains upstream and no temperature drop is recorded. The sensor is connected to a laptop or tablet computer running ShuntCheck software. The sensor is connected to a laptop or tablet computer running ShuntCheck software. The computer analyzes the thermal data, determines ‚ÄúFlow Confirmed‚Äù or ‚ÄúFlow NOT Confirmed‚Äù and presents a time- temperature graph. ShuntCheck Results Screen Early clinical testing of ShuntCheck found that functioning shunts flow intermittently, which meant that a ShuntCheck reading of ‚ÄúFlow NOT Confirmed‚Äù did not necessarily indicate a shunt problem.Marlin AE, Gaskill SJ, The Use of Transcutaneous Thermal Convection Analysis to Assess Shunt Function in the Pediatric Population, Neurosurgery 70:181-3, 2012 This discovery led to the development of the ShuntCheck Micro-Pumper, a handheld device which vibrates the shunt valve, generating a temporary increase in flow through patent, but not through obstructed, shunts. Micro-Pumper allows ShuntCheck to differentiate between temporarily non-flowing patent shunts and obstructed shunts. Micro-Pumper ShuntCheck III The current version of ShuntCheck was developed in 2011-2012 funded by grants from the National Institute of Health and was cleared by the US FDA in 2013. The ShuntCheck system includes the ShuntCheck Sensor, a skin marker, an Instant Cold Pack, a Data Acquisition Unit (an analog-to-digital converter called the ‚ÄúDAQ‚Äù), a Windows 7 or Windows 8 laptop or tablet computer running ShuntCheck software and the Micro-Pumper. ShuntCheck System ShuntCheck clinical studies Boston Children's Hospital 2008-2009 Joseph R. Madsen MD tested 100 symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric hydrocephalus patients using an earlier version of ShuntCheck during 2008-2009. His key findings, reported in Neurosurgery were * The ShuntCheck test is sensitive and specific for detecting shunt flow * But failure to detect flow does not predict the need for surgery University of South Florida 2008 Arthur E. Marlin MD and Sarah J Gaskill MD conducted ShuntCheck testing on 35 asymptomatic pediatric patients with similar results. These findings led to the development of the Micro-Pumper. Boston Children's Hospital 2010-2013 Dr. Madsen is testing 130 symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric hydrocephalus patients to assess the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of the newer version of ShuntCheck including Micro-Pumper. This study was funded by the NIH. Multi-Center Pediatric Outcomes Study 2013-2014 Boston Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Cleveland Clinic, University of Chicago Comer Children's Hospital, LeBonheur Children's Hospital and University of Texas Houston Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital will conduct an outcomes study of 400 symptomatic pediatric hydrocephalus patients during 2013-2014. In this NIH funded study, ShuntCheck results and the results of standard of care diagnostic tests will be compared to clinical outcome (shunt obstruction confirmed by surgery vs no- obstruction). This study seeks to demonstrate that * ShuntCheck is synergistic with imaging. Specifically that ShuntCheck plus imaging yield higher positive and negative predictive values than imaging alone. * ShuntCheck is comparable to imaging in ruling out shunt obstruction in cases which the Attending Physician judges to be ‚Äúunlikely to require shunt surgery‚Äù. Sinai Baltimore NPH Study 2012-2014 Michael A. Williams MD is conducting ShuntCheck testing on adult hydrocephalus patients undergoing radionuclide shunt patency testing. This study, funded by the NIH, seeks to demonstrate that ShuntCheck results match radionuclide results.  Potential clinical uses of ShuntCheck  # A test for assessing shunt function in symptomatic hydrocephalus patients. ShuntCheck flow data, used in conjunction with other diagnostic test results and with physician judgment, can aid in ruling in or ruling out shunt obstruction. # A tool for establishing ‚Äúnormal‚Äù CSF flow patterns in asymptomatic patients. Establishing baseline flow may increase the value of flow information in symptomatic patients. # A tool to streamline the process of adjusting shunt valve settings to accommodate individual needs for CSF drainage. While the settings for these valves in each patient must currently be determined empirically over a number of weeks, Shuntcheck will be helpful in measuring changes in CSF flow due to changes in the valve setting. # A tool for assessing suspected over-drainage. CSF flow data will allow neurosurgeons to identify periods and causes of high CSF flow when assessing suspected CSF over drainage. This data can also be used to evaluate flow and siphon control devices to determine if they are meeting the patient's needs. # A post operative test to confirm shunt function. Hospitals in sparsely populated areas often conduct post-surgical CT scans to confirm shunt function before releasing patients for the long drive home. CSF flow data can confirm shunt function more quickly than CT (which requires time for the ventricles to stabilize). NeuroDx Development NeuroDx Development [10] (NeuroDx) is an early commercial stage medical device company founded in 2008 by Fred Fritz (CEO), a serial life sciences entrepreneur, and Dr. Marek Swoboda (Chief Scientific Officer), a biosensor engineer, to address important unmet needs in the hydrocephalus market. The Company has developed two thermal dilution technologies for assessing shunt function in hydrocephalus patients, ShuntCheck-Micro-Pumper, an eight-minute test of CSF shunt flow, and Continuous Real Time (CRT) ShuntCheck, which uses thermal dilution to monitor changes in shunt flow over longer time periods. The Company's follow-on products, an implantable intracranial pressure monitoring device and a non- invasive monitor of intracranial pressure, are in proof of concept development.

History As of 2013, the Soo hydropower plant is one of the oldest large generating stations still operating in the United States. The power canal and generator complex were begun in September 1898 and completed in June 1902, using engineering work from the first iteration of large-scale electrical generation in the late 1800s. It was from this work that the plant and utility that grew up around it acquired their historic name of Edison Sault, although Thomas Edison did not himself build the plant. From the Canadian shore in winter. The Soo hydropower plant was built to contain 74 generators under a single roof. This was done under the constraints of the Classical style, by building an industrial structure of in length parallel to the St. Marys River and facing the structure with masonry. The sandstone facing of the power station was chiseled out of blocks pulled from the Edison Sault Power Canal, the feeder canal that chutes water to the plant. President William Howard Taft visited the plant in 1911. The power canal and hydroelectric plant were together named a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1983. Although the hydroelectric plant could generate as much as 25-30 megawatts if operating at full capacity, grid planners rate it at 18 MW.

These sound effects include: voiceover, music beds, sweepers, breakers, intros, promos, liners, stingers, bumpers, shotguns, and jingles. The total effect of these on-air elements create an overall sound design, which positions a radio station and brand within the marketplace, and is designed to appeal to the demographics of the audience it wants the station to attract (e.g., Men, Age 18-54). Radio Imaging sonically brands the radio station as clearly different and distinct from other entertainment brands; especially, from other radio stations in a given market. Radio Imaging enables radio listeners to easily identify a radio station and to distinguish a radio station favorably against competitors through a unique and enhanced image and sound, particularly in the same programming format (e.g., CHR, Country, Adult Contemporary, Sports, News/Talk, Classic Rock, Oldies, etc.). Signature sound compositions comprise sonic branding that enables listeners to instantaneously identify the station that they are hearing and to anticipate the type of content or format that will be played on the station. In this way, Radio imaging sets the overall mood, energy and tone of the station, while establishing brand familiarity, affinity and loyalty with a listener. The language used in radio imaging is scripted with the station's target demographic in mind, for example radio stations targeting a younger audience will use language and terms that their listeners can relate to. Likewise, the voiceover used helps define the station brand. In addition, filler compositions including sweepers, promos, and jingles, create seamless transitions between programming units and enhance the overall sound of the station, providing a more complete and polished listening experience for the audience.

She is best known for her collaborative project with the late Herman Wallace, one of the former Angola 3 prisoners, entitled The House That Herman Built. This project is the subject of a critically acclaimed documentary film aired on PBS entitled Herman's House. Sumell is a 2007 Akademie Schloss Solitude Fellow, a 2013 Open Society Soros Justice Fellow, a 2015 Nathan Cummings Foundation Recipient, a 2015 Eyebeam Project Fellow and a 2016 Robert Rauchenberg Artist as Activist Fellow.  Early life  Sumell was born in Brooklyn and grew up on Long Island, New York. She was the first girl to play competitive tackle football in an all-boys league in the New York. She graduated from Connetquot High School and went on to the College of Charleston, where she played Division I soccer.  Education  Sumell received a Bachelor of Science from the College of Charleston in 1996. She received a Post-Baccalaureate degree from San Francisco Art Institute (2001), and a Master of Fine Arts in New Practices from Stanford University in 2004.  Early work  While working on her M.F.A. at Stanford, Sumell challenged President George Bush's election and his policies toward women through a project entitled No Bush. Sumell asked women to shave their pubic hair and send it to her in a plastic bag, which she exhibited on a clothesline at the National Mall to draw attention to the erosion of pro-choice laws under the Bush administration. While in residency at the Temple Bar Gallery in Dublin, Ireland, Sumell explored locality, difference and identity in a project called A=AGHT. It connected youth from New Orleans to youth from Dublin through their joint creation of an imaginary city.  The House That Herman Built  In 2001 Sumell attended a lecture in San Francisco where she met Robert King, the first of the Angola 3 to be released from prison and decades of solitary confinement at Angola Prison. She was moved by King's composure despite his having spent 29 years in solitary confinement. She asked him how she could become more involved with the Angola 3 movement, which was advocating release of the other two men who continued to be held in solitary. King said that she should begin by writing his comrades, Albert Woodfox and Herman Wallace. Wallace had been imprisoned since 1972 when he was placed in solitary confinement after being accused of the murder of a prison guard at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. (both he and Woodfox were convicted of this murder.) After 2 years of correspondence with Wallace, while Sumell was still at Stanford, she asked him to describe his dream home. She had intended to propose such a project to a professor as the basis for an assignment. Wallace's answer would serve as the basis for her ongoing collaborative project with him, known as The House That Herman Built. A documentary film, Herman's House, was made of their process together, albeit at a distance. What became an 11-year collaboration between Sumell and Wallace tours as an art exhibition. It is used to engage the viewing audience in a dialogue about the use of long-term solitary confinement in America's prisons. Using imaginative space to build the house that Wallace envisions, Sumell connects the human imagination to the realities of the prison system. In addition to mounting the exhibit, Sumell is endeavoring to construct The House That Herman Built as a full-size structure in Wallace's hometown of New Orleans. Wallace intends for the house to be used as a community space committed to youth outreach and education. As it was originally conceived, The House That Herman Built is designed to be an open space that encourages the exchange of ideas, art and activism. It will be open for anyone to visit and learn about the practice of solitary confinement in American prisons. The exhibition, which renders to scale the model of Herman's house, has been shown in more than a dozen countries. It has been shown at The American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, The Brooklyn Library Main Branch The Royal College of Art in London, Artist's Space in New York City, The Akademie Schloss-Solitude in Stuttgart, Germany; The St Etienne Biennial, France; The Alternator Gallery in Vancouver, British Columbia; Prospect 1 in New Orleans, and ZKM in Karlsruhe, Germany. Herman Wallace died October 4, 2013 from liver cancer, a few days after he was released from prison. Sumell continues to be active in the movement to end the use of long-term solitary confinement in the United States. She continued as an advocate and spokesperson for Albert Woodfox, the remaining prisoner of the Angola 3, speaking frequently on his behalf at rallies, benefits and lectures. Ms Sumell's life and work is documented in the photo-journalistic essay here The last member, Albert Woodfox, did not gain release until February 2016. With the state preparing to try him a third time after two convictions were overturned, he accepted a plea deal of \\"no contest\\" for lower charges. He said his health and age required him to choose this course rather than go through another trial, as the state had said it would indict him.  Solitary Gardens  Sumell embarked on another major project entitled the Solitary Gardens. This is a public art project created to protest solitary confinement and serve as an alternative land use. Sumell invites viewers to imagine a landscape without prisons. The project uses the tools of prison abolition, permaculture, and alternative education to facilitate unexpected exchanges between persons in solitary confinement and volunteer communities on the \\"outside.\\" The six-foot-by-nine-foot Solitary Gardens are built to the size of a US solitary cell and are \\"gardened\\" by prisoners through written exchanges with volunteers. Sumell (and other advocates of reform) suggests that the over-representation of African-American men in prison is one of the outcomes of the history of many of the United States as slave societies. Solitary Gardens will be constructed from the historic commodities of the South, worked by slaves: sugarcane, cotton and indigo. It intends to show that slavery continues in another form. The project has been supported financially by the Nathan Cummings Foundation, Eyebeam NYC, New Orleans Redevelopment Authority (NORA) and the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation. Sumell still intends to build Herman's House in New Orleans, where Wallace spent his childhood and early adulthood before incarceration.

Ramsey, 271 U.S. 467 (1926), was a U.S. Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the government had the authority to prosecute crimes against Native Americans (Indians) on reservation land that was still designated Indian Country by federal law. The Osage Indian Tribe held mineral rights that were worth millions of dollars. A white rancher, William K. Hale, devised a plot to kill tribal members to allow his nephew, who was married to a tribal member, to inherit the mineral rights. The tribe requested the assistance of the federal government, which sent Bureau of Investigation agents to solve the murders. Hale and several others were arrested and tried for the murders, but they claimed that the federal government did not have jurisdiction. The district court quashed the indictments, but on appeal, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that the Osage lands were Indian Country and that the federal government therefore had jurisdiction. This put an end to the Osage Indian murders. Background =Federal law= In 1834, Congress passed the Indian Trade and Intercourse ActIndian Trade and Intercourse Act of 1834, June 30, 1834, chap. 161, ¬ß 25, , amended by Act of Mar. 27, 1854, chap. 26,¬ß 3, , codified at R.S. ¬ß 2145; 1 18 (Charles J. Kappler ed. 1904). to regulate trade with the Indians and to provide the United States with criminal jurisdiction for crimes committed by or against Indians. This law provided for trial in a federal court for crimes committed by an Indian against a non- Indian or vice versa. At the time of passage, federal jurisdiction over the Indian Territory was given to the U.S. court in Arkansas and, in 1851, this was clarified as the western district court in Arkansas.Genetin-Pilawa, at 1830. In 1890, this law was amended to create the Oklahoma Territory and to give the federal courts in western Arkansas, southern Kansas, and eastern Texas jurisdiction over the Indian Territory.Oklahoma Organic Act, May 2, 1890, chap. 182, ; Kappler at 51. =Territory, statehood and allotment= Oklahoma and Indian Territory map, circa 1890s, created using Census Bureau Data In 1870, the federal government purchased the Kansas reservation from the Osage Nation. The tribe then purchased 1,470,559 acres of land in the Indian Territory from the Cherokee Nation., 28 (1998); , 44‚Äì45 (1994). The land was not suited for farming, but had abundant game., at 28‚Äì29. In 1890 when Congress passed the Oklahoma Organic Act forming both the Oklahoma and Indian territories, the Osage Indian Reservation was part of the Oklahoma Territory. In 1887, Congress passed the Dawes Act,Dawes Act of 1887, Feb. 8, 1887, chap. 119, ; Kappler at 33‚Äì36. which served to break up reservations and allot the land to tribal members. The act did not apply to the Five Civilized Tribes or other tribes in the Indian territory nor to the Osage tribe in the Oklahoma territory. In 1898 the Curtis ActCurtis Act of 1898, June 28, 1898, chap. 517, Kappler at 90‚Äì100. applied allotment to the Five Civilized Tribes, leaving the Osage tribe as the only tribe with a reservation in Oklahoma., 294 (1998); at 220. Under the provisions that Congress had established, Oklahoma could not become a state until all reservations were eliminated. at 46. The Osage tribe, seeing the disastrous effects of allotment, resisted it until 1906, at 34. when they negotiated an allotment different in two major respects. First, no Osage land would be opened up for white settlement as surplus land at 47. because the tribe had purchased it, at 47. and second, mineral rights were retained by the tribe, and not in a trust status through the federal government. at 47; Jon D. May, Osage Murders (Apr. 7, 2007) (archived from original, July 29, 2013). Even though the Osage reservation remained, this allotment was deemed sufficient and Oklahoma became a state in 1907. =Reign of terror= This ownership of the land and mineral rights had another consequence. In 1896, Edwin B. Foster signed an oil lease for the entire Osage reservation., at 30‚Äì31; Gerald Forbes, History of the Osage Blanket Lease, in 19 70 (Mar. 1941) (archived from original, July 11, 2013). By 1902 he was shipping 37,000 barrels of oil and by 1906 his companies were producing over 5 million barrels annually., at 32; Forbes at 73. The Osage tribe was one of the wealthiest in the United States, but with the mineral rights transferring to the land owners in 1926, their murder rates also became the highest in the United States. at 220. By 1925, Osage families were earning about $65,000 per year, compared to white families that were averaging $1,000., 101 (2012). Congress also passed a law providing that an Osage Indian who was less than half blood, as determined by the Secretary of the Interior, did not have to wait to sell his or her land., at 37. In the early 1920s, Osage Indians who owned headrights, or land where they would obtain mineral rights, began to be murdered‚Äîthe first two were Charles Whitehorn and Anna Brown, both Osage Indians but killed separately., 440 (2004); May; Molly Stephey, The Osage Murders: Oil Wealth, Betrayal and the FBI‚Äôs First Big Case(Mar. 1, 2011) (archived from original Aug. 15, 2013). In February 1923, Henry Roan, another Osage, was found in his car, shot once in the back of the head with a .45 caliber pistol. at 440‚Äì41; May; Stephey. Less than a month later, an explosion in an Osage home killed Reta Smith, an Osage, her white husband W.E. Smith, and their white maid. at 441; May; Stephey. Reta Smith was Brown's sister and the daughter of Lizzie Q. Kyle (also known as Lizzie Que), who had died and was thought to have been poisoned. at 440‚Äì41; May; Stephey. Roan was Reta Smith's cousin. at 440‚Äì41. Que had three headrights and both daughters had a full headright and a fractional headright, worth a considerable amount of money.May. These would be inherited by a third daughter, Molly Burkhart, who was married to a white man, Ernie Burkhart. at 440‚Äì41. Ernie Burkhart was the nephew of a wealthy Texas rancher, William K. Hale, who had moved to the Osage area. at 440‚Äì41. =Federal investigation= Following these deaths and several others, the Osage Tribal Council requested federal assistance since local authorities were apparently making no effort to solve the crimes. at 14; May; Stephey. The U.S. Bureau of Investigation (BOI), which later became the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), was assigned to conduct the investigation., at 39; at 14. The BOI responded by sending in undercover agents disguised as cattle buyers and cowhands and, through their investigation, determined that the murders had been planned and executed at the direction of Hale., at 39; at 14; Stephey. Hale was implicated in the murder of Brown when Kelsie Morrison confessed in court., at 40‚Äì41. The BOI also discovered that Hale held a $25,000 insurance policy on Roan and noted that his nephew's wife had inherited all of the Kyle headrights., at 42; Stephey. Hale and John Ramsey were charged in federal court with the murder of Roan; Ernie Burkhart was charged in state court with arranging the Smith bombing., at 42. =The trials= Ernie Burkhart was tried first. Two weeks into the trial, realizing that he could not win, he changed his plea to guilty and became a witness for the state in exchange for a life sentence., at 42‚Äì43; May. Burkhart testified that Hale was behind the scheme, that Asa \\"Ace\\" Kirby was the bomber, and that Henry Grammer was the go-between. Hale and Ramsey were transferred to Guthrie, Oklahoma in 1926, where they stood trial in state court for the murder of Roan. The trial resulted in a hung jury and a mistrial., at 44. The United States Attorney then transferred the case to Oklahoma City and indicted Hale and Ramsey for murder on federal land for the death of Roan.United States v. Ramsey, ; , at 44. On being indicted, both demurrered on the grounds that the federal government did not have jurisdiction. The U.S. District Court sustained the defendants' motion and the government made a direct appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.Ramsey, 271 U.S. at 468. Opinion of the court Justice Sutherland, author of the majority opinion Justice George Sutherland delivered the opinion of the court. He noted that the indictment was drawn under Revised Statute ¬ß 2145, which provides for federal jurisdiction of crimes committed in \\"Indian Country\\".Ramsey, 271 U.S. at 469. This section was no longer applicable to general crimes in Oklahoma after statehood. Crimes committed by or against Indians could still be prosecuted under ¬ß 2145 if the crime occurred in Indian Country.Ramsey, 271 U.S. at 469‚Äì70. The question before the court was whether allotted land, with a restriction on sale by the Indian it was allotted to, was still Indian Country. Since the government controlled whether the land could be sold or otherwise alienated, it was no different from land held in trust and was therefore still Indian Country.Ramsey, 271 U.S. at 470‚Äì72. The judgment of the district court was in error and was reversed.Ramsey, 271 U.S. at 472. Subsequent developments =Trial in U.S. District Court= Following the decision of the Supreme Court, Hale, Burkhart, and Ramsey were tried in federal court. Ernie Burkhart testified that Hale hired Ramsey to kill Roan., at 45. Burkhart also testified to Hale's involvement in the Smith bombing, while Hale testified that he was in Fort Worth, Texas at the time of the killings.Hale v.

All three defendants were convicted and sentenced to life in prison; within days, both Hale and Ramsey appealed., at 44‚Äì45. =Appeal= Hale's appeal was heard first in 1928. It was based on improper procedure in admitting Burkhart's testimony as to the Smith bombing and again on the contention that the federal government did not have jurisdiction to try the case.Hale, 25 F.2d at 435, 440; , at 45. The Eighth Circuit Court denied the plea to the jurisdiction, noting that the Supreme Court had ruled on that very issue earlier in the case.Hale, 25 F.2d at 435. The court did find that the testimony as to the Smith bombing was not relevant to the Roan murder, was prejudicial against Hale, and required that the case be remanded for retrial.Hale, 25 F.2d at 440; , at 45. Ramsey's appeal was likewise successful on the same grounds in 1929.Ramsey v. United States, 33 F.2d 699 (8th Cir. 1929); , at 45. =Retrial= In 1929, both Hale and Ramsey were retried for the murder., at 45‚Äì47.

Ampelographers believe that the grape is indigenous to Majorca with DNA profiling showing no known relationship to the Sardinian wine grape Gir√≤ or to Grenache which is known as Gir√≤ (without the blanc designation) on Majorca.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 412 Allen Lane 2012 Today the grape is almost exclusively found on the island of Majorca with in cultivation in 2012. History The Balearic islands off the eastern coast of Spain. Majorca is the large island in the center of the chain. Ampelographers believe that Gir√≥ blanc is likely indigenous to the island of Majorca. The variety was nearly extinct in the late 20th century with only a few scattered vines left on the island. Spanish winegrowers Toni Gelabert and Juaquin Monserrat began cultivating these vines and eventually had 200 vines available for further propagation by Spanish growers on the Balearic islands. In 1995, Gelabert produced the first commercial Gir√≥ blanc wine from vines planted at his Manacor estate on the western end of Majorca. By 2010 the grape was officially recognized by the Spanish government as a commercial wine grape. Viticulture Gir√≥ blanc is an early budding but late-ripening grape variety that produces a moderately vigorous canopy with large bunches of small grapes. The grape's skins are relatively thick which gives the berries some protection against the viticultural hazards of downy and powdery mildews but the vine still has some susceptible to fungal infections such as botrytis bunch rot. =Relationship to other grapes= Despite also being known as Gir√≥ in the Balearic islands, Grenache (pictured) has no known relationship with Gir√≥ blanc. Historically, Gir√≥ blanc was thought to be either a color mutation of Grenache, which is known as Gir√≥ in the Balearics, or in someway related to the red Italian wine grape Gir√≤ that is grown on the nearby island of Sardinia. The French ampelographer Pierre Galet was one of the first to dismiss these theories and speculate that Gir√≥ blanc was its own distinct variety. Galet's intuition was proven correct in the early 21st century when DNA profiling showed that Gir√≥ blanc was not related to either Grenache or Gir√≤. Wine styles According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Gir√≥ blanc produces full-bodied white wines that usually have high alcohol levels and medium acidity which takes well to barrel aging. The wines tend to be highly aromatic with what Robinson describes as \\"noticeable power for a white wine\\" with citrus and tropical fruit aromas that can also include a p√¢tisserie note in some examples.

She served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as a convoy escort. She was named for Edmundston, New Brunswick. Background Flower-class corvettes like Edmundston serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French for classes of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Edmundston was ordered on 14 February 1940 as part of the 1939‚Äì1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down 23 August 1940 by Yarrows Ltd. at Esquimalt, British Columbia and launched 22 February 1941. Edmundston was commissioned at Esquimalt on 21 October 1941. During her career, Edmundston underwent two significant refits. The first took place beginning in January 1943 at Halifax, Nova Scotia where her fo'c'sle was extended. The refit was finished in May 1943. The second major refit was done at Liverpool, Nova Scotia from May to July 1944. War service After workups, Edmundston was assigned to Esquimalt Force. On 20 June 1942, she rescued 31 crew of , which had been torpedoed off Cape Flattery by the Japanese submarine . The ship itself was towed into Victoria Harbour by . On 13 September 1942, Edmundston was reassigned to the Atlantic. She arrived at Halifax in October. Upon arrival she was assigned to the Western Local Escort Force. After workups following her first major refit, she joined the Royal Navy-controlled escort group EG 5, which protected convoys in the Atlantic and on routes to and from Gibraltar and Sierra Leone. She spent the next ten months as an ocean escort. On 25 August 1943 EG 5, consisting of the British frigates and and the Canadian corvettes , and Edmundston were sent to relieve the 40th Escort Group which had been deployed on a U-boat hunt off Cape Ortegal. While this was in progress the ships were attacked at 14:15 by 14 Dornier Do 217s and 7 Junkers Ju 88s with the new German glide bomb weapon, the Henschel Hs293 A-1. The sloops and , who were part of the 40th Escort Group, were the first of the Allied and Royal Navy ships to be attacked and damaged by them. Several sailors were injured in Bideford and one sailor was killed. Two days later the force sent to relieve Edmundstons group was also attacked and suffered losses. After her second refit and workups in Bermuda, she joined Mid-Ocean Escort Force escort group C-8 in August 1944. She served with this group until the end of the war. Post-war service Edmundston was paid off at Sorel, Quebec on 16 June 1945. She was sold for mercantile use in 1948 and converted to a cargo ship of . Under the new name Amepala she was last on Lloyd's Register in 1961‚Äì62. The ship was broken up in 1961.

It premiered on August 9, 2013 at the D23 Expo in Anaheim, California and was shown in theaters with Muppets Most Wanted on March 21, 2014. Party Central is the second short in the Monsters, Inc. franchise and takes place shortly after the events of Monsters University. The short involves Mike and Sulley helping their Oozma Kappa fraternity brothers make their party a success. Plot Mike and Sulley are visiting Monsters University for the weekend to see how their Oozma Kappa fraternity brothers are doing. The group is throwing its first party, but no one has shown up. Fortunately, Mike and Sulley have a plan to liven up the house, to which using a borrowed door station, they sneak into a party at the Roar Omega Roar fraternity and steal all of its food and guests to fill the Oozma Kappa house. The supply runs take them through the closet doors of a married couple's bedroom, repeatedly disturbing their sleep. Once they have the party fully stocked, Scott \\"Squishy\\" Squibbles' mother Sherri walks in on it while doing a load of laundry. She is angry with the fraternity, but only because they did not invite her. After lighting a bonfire on the lawn, Sherri introduces the crowd to \\"door jumping\\"/\\"door jamming\\", involving jumping from the roof with the help of two doors to land safely on the lawn.\\"Door jamming\\", \\"door jumping\\" are used in different translations. The guests congratulate the Oozma Kappas for throwing a great party, and many of them decide to pledge the fraternity. In a post-credits scene, the husband and wife wake their son Timmy up and ask if they can sleep with him, saying that there are monsters in their closet. Timmy vehemently replies, \\"That's what I've been trying to tell you!\\".

We haven‚Äôt thrown a party yet, but when we do we‚Äôll be ready,'... I kept telling [director] Dan [Scanlon], 'I really want to see their party. We have to do it in the credits or something.' Then when the idea of doing a short came up, we were like, 'That could be the party!'\\" The short took around eight months to make, to which the voices were recorded near end of production of Monsters University. Mann stated \\"We would do a couple of pickup lines with Billy Crystal and the other actors for the movie and then we‚Äôd get the stuff we needed for the short.\\" Party Central was initially considered as a bonus feature for the Monsters University DVD, but the decision was later made to release the short theatrically. It was originally scheduled to accompany the theatrical release of Pixar's The Good Dinosaur until the film was shifted from 2014 to 2015. Release Party Central premiered on August 9, 2013 at the D23 Expo in Anaheim, California and accompanied the theatrical release of Muppets Most Wanted on March 21, 2014.

The surrounding neighbourhood is variously referred to as Holmbladsgadekvarteret (literally \\"The Holmbladsgade neighbourhood\\"), Amagerbro or Sundby North. History The street was originally known as K√∏hlertsvej (\\"K√∏hlerts Road\\") and was access road to K√∏hlert's textile manufactury which had been founded in about 1770. Christianshavn Iron Foundry and Machine Factory built a large industrial complex at the road in the 1980s. The street received its current name in 1897 after Lauritz Peter Holmblad, a local industrialist and philanthropist, who had his home in the street until his death in 1890. The iron foundry and machine factory Nathanael's Church was inaugurated in 1899 and over the next decades many apartment buildings sprung up along the street, which became part of a dense working-class neigobourhood. Many new industrial enterprises also established in the street, including Holmblad's old glue factory, the later Sadolin & Holmblad, which inaugurated a new factory at No. 70in 1903. Other industrial establishments along the street was a meat-packing central (√∏√∏Slagteriernes Central), manufacturer of metal sheet goods and various storage buildings. Christianshavn Iron Foundry and Machine Factory existed under various names until the 1960s when the complex was taken over by a galvanization facility (galvaniseringsanstalten). Most of the industry disappeared towards the end of the century and many of its buildings were torn down to make way for modern ones. The iron foundry complex from the 1880s was demolished in 1979 and replaced by st√∏berig√•rden which was built in the mid 1980s. Sadolin & Holmblad's building was demolished in 2001 and replaced by Sadolin Parken, a mixed-use development, which was inaugurated in 2004. The street became subject to a comprehensive gentrification programme in 1897. The initiative received the German Bilfinger Berger Award as an \\"exemplary urban development project\\". Notable buildings and residents Nathanael's Church Nathanael's Church's was completed in 1899. Its architect is Thorvald J√∏rgensen who later designed the present Christiansborg Palace. The church took over Holmblad's villa which was expanded and adapted in 1988 and is now known as Nathanaels Sogneg√•rd. The oldest surviving building in the street is the low building from 1859 at No. 70. Prismen interior Dorte Mandrup designed two community centres in connection with the facelift of the area. Holmbladsgade Cultural Centre, a former warehouse associated with Holmblad's oil mill, was inaugurated in 2001 and contains the local Sundby Library as well as various other facilities for the local community. Prismen (\\"The Crystal\\") was inaugurated in 2006 and is a multifunctional sports and cultural venue. An appendage to the surrounding buildings,it has a characteristic angled form and a translucent skin of polycarbonate panels which contrasts the bricks of the surrounding buildings, let daylight into the building in the daytime and makes it glow at night.

Tauber was his mother's maiden name. His parents were married by a Rabbi and never filed for a civil licence due to quotas on the number of Jewish marriages in Galicia then under Austrian rule. Henryks father's name was Abraham Fuchsbrunner and Fuchsbrunner was the name by which he was known. Henryk Fuchsbrunner shortened his name to Henry Fuchs after he arrived in the United States in 1952. Fuchsbrunner was one of five children. He lived with his extended family in Chrzan√≥w in south Poland before the outbreak of war, After several deportations, Tauber arrived at the Krak√≥w Ghetto. After avoiding capture by the Germans for over 3 years, he was arrested in November 1942 and sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. Shortly after arriving at Auschwitz, he was selected for work in the Sonderkommando at the crematoria of the camp, where his specialised job of stoking the ovens with corpses probably ensured his survival.Pressac, Jean-Claude, (1989) AUSCHWITZ: Technique and Operation of the Gas Chambers, Beate Klarsfeld Foundation (p.482) Sonderkommando at Auschwitz The Sonderkommando were almost always Jewish prisoners, selected because of their health and age, to work within the crematoria at Auschwitz- Birkenau. They were separated from other prisoners and put to work in one of the 5 crematoria that existed between January 1943 and January 1945, when the marches eastward - a.k.a. the death marches - began. Their work included dragging the dead prisoners from the gas chambers to the ovens within the crematoria after the poisonous Zyklon B gas had been administered by the Nazi chemists, placing the corpses on rollers to be put into the ovens, sorting the bodies according to size and fat content to maximize the efficiency of the ovens, and properly stoking the ovens for burning the dead. The work was gruesome and many sonderkommando did not make it past their first day. So as not to alarm or inform the rest of the inmates about what transpired within the crematoria, once a prisoner was marked as a sonderkommando, he was barred from leaving the crematoria and lived within, never allowed to mix with the other Auschwitz-Birkenau prisoners. Each crematorium was manned by members of the SS, rather than by Ukrainian or Wehrmacht. The typical Sonderkommando survived only few months, dying either from illness or from having virtually their entire \\"generation\\" of sonderkommando exterminated in the gas chambers and their bodies burnt in the ovens. Fuchsbrunner's participation in the Crematoria Uprising Fuchsbrunner participated in the Crematoria Uprising of 1944, during which 3 of 23 SS soldiers were killed and a further 12 were wounded. Another source (Dragon) testified that Fuchsbrunner participated in the killing of no less than 5 SS guards stationed at Crematoria II before the uprising was put down. Fuchsbrunner later was given an assignment outside the crematoria, before being returned to his position as a stoker in Crematoria IV in late October 1944. He escaped again 3 months later in January 1945, that time successfully. Escape When the camp began to be evacuated by death marches in January 1945, Fuchsbrunner escaped near Pszczyna.Yisrael Gutman and Michael Berenbaum (editors) (1994), Anatomy of the Auschwitz Death Camp Indiana University Press (p. 517) Fuchsbrunner is believed to have been among the, if not the, longest known surviving member of the Sonderkommando, having been forced to join in January 1943. Fuchsbrunner's escape in January 1945 is written about in Gideon Greif's book, We Wept Without Tears. Fuchsbrunner and two other Sonderkommando inmates, brothers Shlomo and Abraham Dragon, escaped during a death march, subsequently commandeering a farmhouse and taking 2 prisoners, until their escape was made possible into the Russian zone.\\"We Wept without Tears\\", pages 176-178 On 24 May 1945, Fuchsbruner gave evidence at a Polish judicial enquiry in Auschwitz under Judge Jan Sehn. He was the only witness to give a precise and detailed description of the equipment and workings of the crematoria and gas chambers at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Pressac describes Fuchsbrunner's testimony as \\"head and shoulders\\" above any other given on the workings of the death camps and 95% accurate. In his May 1945 testimony, Fuchsbrunner was one of the first to mention the now infamous \\"Angel of Death\\" Josef Mengele in his descriptions of the mass killings and administration of Zyklon B in the Auschwitz crematoria. His testimony, as well as that he survived for so long in the Sonderkommando - nearly 2 years, when the typical lifespan of a Sonderkommando was about 3 months - is considered exceptional. Fuchs' is described by Pressac in his book Auschwitz: Technique and Operation of the Gas Chambers as a modest man who shied away from the limelight and who gave testimony as objectively as possible, even on the brink of what the human mind could handle. After the war, Fuchsbrunner was able to free his brother, Bendit Fuchsbrunner, from the Soviet Union, where he had been held since his escape to Russia from Poland during the first days of the German invasion in 1939. For seven years after war ended, the two brothers lived in Munich, where they opened a leather business, Die Br√ºder Fuchsbrunner Leder Herstellung. In 1952, after selling the business, they arrived in the United States on the Libert√©, a French-flagged ship. Fuchsbrunner died on 3 January 2000 at the age of 82. He was survived by his wife and 3 children.

Natal obtained a bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 2008, where he was president of the Puerto Rican Student Association and an Hermano of La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda Fraternity, Inc. He did not expect to be accepted by the institution, having applied to study in it as a protocolary measure. When the acceptance letter was received, Natal was surprised and this event triggered a period of adaptation. He offered a speech at his graduation in his role of class president. After returning to Puerto Rico, Natal received a juris doctor from the University of Puerto Rico School of Law in 2011, also serving as president of the student council during his tenure. After graduating from Cornell, Natal became a key figure in a series of strikes held at the University of Puerto Rico in protest of a quota being introduced to the students. Consequently, he became involved with the Popular Democratic Party and participated in an internal election for the presidency of the party's National Youth organization. After completing his juris doctor Natal opened his own lawfirm and worked for Charlie Hern√°ndez and Luis Vega Ramos, prominent members of the free association movement. In 2013, Natal was named director of the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico Commission on the Judiciary. Representative at-large (2013‚Äìpresent) =Election to the House of Representatives= A few months after Natal became director of the House Commission on the Judiciary, Eduardo Ferrer relinquished his position of Representative at-large for the PPD, formally opening a vacancy at the House for the PPD. The party announced that the position would be filled with the vote of the General Council's delegates during a special election. Subsequently, Natal formally announced that he was going to pursue the vacancy and submitted the required documentation on August 5, 2013. His bid was seen as \\"difficult\\", since the PPD's conservative leadership (led by Alejandro Garc√≠a Padilla, incumbent Governor and President of the PPD) was at the moment in direct conflict with the free association movement over the continuation of the territorial clause. Besides him, nine other members presented the required documentation before the deadline. Only five candidates made the cut to be on the final ballot, Claribel Mart√≠nez Marmolejos, Yasm√≠n Mej√≠as, Carlos Rechani, Darlene Reyes and Natal. Unofficial polls organized by Radio Isla 1320 and Representative Carlos Vargas concluded that the public favored Natal over the four other candidates. The special election took an ideological emphasis after Garc√≠a Padilla dismissed the free association movement, implying that they were a reduced group by saying that the free association movement, \\"are not a wing, but rather a few feathers\\", iIllustrating his opposition to the faction by publicly supporting Mart√≠nez. Natal indirectly referred to this event, adopting the slogan, \\"Quills have written the best chapters of our history.\\" In the days leading to the special election, the PPD's leadership strengthened its campaign to secure the votes for Mart√≠nez, including public support from Eduardo Bhatia, President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, and Jaime Perell√≥, Speaker of the House. Public reports claimed that the PPD's conservative leadership was aggressive in its support campaign for Mart√≠nez, even offering jobs to the delegates in exchange for their votes. This raised concern among the other candidates, with Rechani, Mej√≠as and former contestant Ruthy Curr√°s claiming that they had received pressure to abandon the race. Despite this, Natal opted to ignore the controversy, instead continuing with his own campaign and presenting a series of proposals. The special election took place on August 14, 2013, with Natal defeating Mart√≠nez with a margin of 175 to 131, with 20 votes being divided between the other candidates. He effectively became a member of the House and a legislator on August 19, 2013, at the age of 26, after the House inaugurated its second ordinary session. Natal's first official action was to serve as cosponsor of P.C. 1334, a bill that specifies a method to select the delegates of a Constituent Assembly that will deal with the political status of Puerto Rico between 2014 and 2018. He was given the presidency of the Integrated Commission for Youth Development, Promotion and Retention of New Talent. Natal was also named vicepresident of the commissions of International & Federal Affairs and Veteran Affairs, while also participating in five other. =Political track record= His first original project was a proposal to retain young professionals and minimize their migration rate. The project was based on the reduction of bureaucratic requirements for the foundation of new enterprises and the eventual creation of an Institute for Entrepreneurship. Further efforts included the inclusion of classes focused on entrepreneurship in the education curriculum and the creation of a similar institute focused in the business education of youth. Natal explained that the ultimate goal of these proposals was to retain the capital among local businesses, reducing its export by foreign corporations. His next initiative sought the international recognition of the Puerto Rican citizenship through the Secretary of State, pursuing more rights within the international community. A related project, P.C. 1417, also revoked an amendment made to the Political Code of Puerto Rico by the pro-statehood government of Pedro Rossell√≥, which only granted Puerto Rican citizenship to those that already possessed United States citizenship, effectively preventing foreign immigrants from claiming it. On December 21, 2013, Natal was the only member of the PPD to oppose a bill that reduced the retirement pension received by teachers. This decision was preceded by days of reunions with education guilds, which took place in the midst of an accelerated and controversial special session called forth by Garc√≠a Padilla. Natal was the last member of a larger group to remain firm in his original position, with the others yielding and offering explanatory votes. He represented the Agricultural, Natural & Environmental Resources Commission during the public hearings of a project that pursued amends to the Biotechnology Law, there he expressed concerns that the proposed changes would facilitate multinational experiments without supervision and questioned if Monsanto was involved by supporting the bill. Furthermore, Natal noted that the entire process should be analyzed while taking under consideration the poor track record of biotechnology corporations and the multiples controversies surrounding their crops. After Standard & Poor's downgraded the government's credit to BB rating, Natal opened a webpage where he intended to gather civil proposals to attend the crisis. He followed this with P.C. 1740, which proposed equitable salaries between men and women, attending a pre-existing imbalance between genders. On March 17, 2014, Natal presented a bill to attend water scarcity by prohibiting its exportation during droughts, which received the cognomen of P. C. 1764. Personal life and ideology Within the PPD, Natal is a member of the free association movement, the wing that supports replacing the territorial clause with a document based on their vision of a sovereign compact, reclaiming the sovereignty of Puerto Rico while conserving existing arrangements of the commonwealth such as common defense, coin, and American citizenship. Unfortunately, a critical weakness in this movement is that such bilateral negotiations would only take place after independence (independence first, association later). Furthermore, because treaty agreements between sovereign nations would have to be re-negotiated on a periodic basis, American citizenship in perpetuity (or at all for citizens who do not already have a right to claim under jus sanguini or jus soli) would be impossible to guarantee, and in direct conflict with the U.S. Constitution. Upon completing his education, Natal settled in Old San Juan. He is an avid follower of sports, and practices cycling, basketball and triathlon. He was the original PPD's representative in Panel Pol√≠tico, a daily radio show hosted by reporter Normando Valent√≠n in WKAQ 580, where he served as the counterweight of Gary Rodr√≠guez. On March 4, 2014, Natal decided to abandon the program citing no interest to continue involved in \\"destructive\\" and \\"irresponsible\\" partisan discussions, a decision influenced by opposition senator Carmelo R√≠os who accused him on air of participating in a manifestation where protesters had placed dog food and a \\"Beware of Dog\\" sign before a SWAT line during the 2010 strike. The PNP had promoted this supposed incident since he was elected, despite being asked in a formal letter to desist. Natal claimed that a series of anonymous threats related to his purported involvement in the incident had been received by mail, endangering his family. The following day, the group that was actually involved in the protest, members of a plastic artistry movement named Indi.gesti√≥n, publicly stated that Natal was never involved in it and denied even knowing him personally. Natal expressed gratitude that the group decided to clear his reputation on its own initiative, also clarifying that Indi.gesti√≥n was not related to the UPR student movement in any way.

Education DeStefano graduated from Cornell University in 1974, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree, and the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, from which he received a medical degree in 1978. He received his MPH at Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1984. Research DeStefano is an author of a number of scientific studies concluding that vaccines, in particular thimerosal- containing ones, do not cause autism. In March 2013, for example, DeStefano was the lead author on a study in the Journal of Pediatrics, which concluded that exposure of children to particular ingredients in vaccines, namely proteins and polysaccharides, did not increase their risk of autism. In addition, DeStefano et al. concluded that children with autism had received the same number of antigens as children without. This study received widespread media attention. As director of the ISO, his research focuses primarily on alleged and real adverse reactions to vaccines, and how common these reactions are. As mentioned above, some of DeStefano's research pertains to the use of thiomersal in vaccines; for example, he co-authored a study in 2003 in Pediatrics which concluded that there was no consistent association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, he was the final author of a study on the alleged link between thimerosal and autism, authored by the Vaccine Safety Datalink team, published in the New England Journal of Medicine. This study concluded that \\"Our study does not support a causal association between early exposure to mercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines and immune globulins and deficits in neuropsychological functioning at the age of 7 to 10 years.\\" Other topics he has published research on include Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, as well as the potential link between seizures and the whole-cell pertussis vaccine or MMR vaccine. More generally, with regard to the VSD, he published a study in 2001 summarizing the ability of the project to reveal potential risks associated with vaccination, especially intussusception, through conduction of a population-based cohort study. Originally, however, DeStefano's research focused on the safety of contraceptives, a topic he researched from 1982 to 1984 as a medical officer at the National Institutes of Health. Also in 1982, he joined the CDC as a senior epidemiologist in the Agent Orange projects. Career After completing a residency in pediatrics at the University of Rochester School of Medicine, he joined the Epidemic Intelligence Service in 1979. In 1982, he completed a CDC residency in preventive medicine. In 2004, DeStefano was appointed acting chief of the Immunization Safety Branch of the National Immunization Program, now known as the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. From 1992 to 1996, DeStefano held a post at the Marshfield Medical Research Foundation in Marshfield, Wisconsin. In 1996, he returned to the CDC.

Today, the territory of the former manor of Champlain is located in the administrative region of Mauricie in Quebec, Canada. The capital was the town of Champlain. The Lordship of Champlain stretched from the north shore of the St. Lawrence River (west of the mouth of the Champlain River) up towards the north, parallel to the Lordship of Batiscan on the east side. The north-south dividing line between the two domains also divides the municipalities of Saint-Narcisse and H√©rouxville. Toponymy During an exploration trip in 1632, Samuel de Champlain, the acknowledged founder of New France, gave his name to the Champlain River. Subsequently, the first lord, √âtienne P√©zard de la Touche, adopted the place name of Champlain to describe his lordship. The same place name was used by the Catholic parish at Champlain, to describe the town of Champlain in 1845, and the federal electoral district in 1867. History of the Lordship Many people used the St. Lawrence River before the creation of the Lordship of Champlain. The indigenous peoples were present along the river for more than 5,000 to 7,000 years. The Vikings sailed along the east coast of Canada and in the waters of the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the 11th century, and French fishermen frequented the Gasp√© Peninsula before Jacques Cartier first arrived in Canada in 1534. In 1535, during his second voyage of discovery on the St. Lawrence River, Cartier passed the site of the future town of Champlain. In 1580, the Basque people made several fishing trips to the St. Lawrence River. In 1603, Samuel de Champlain went to Champlain, Quebec. He erected the first permanent post which became Quebec City in 1608. The town of Trois-Rivi√®res was founded in 1634. On August 16, 1643, Jacques Aubuchon of Trois-Rivi√®res was granted permission to settle on land of the future Lordship of Champlain. However, he did not do so, mainly because of the property's remoteness and the threat of attacks by the Iroquois. He sold his share in 1645. The Marsolet and Hertel land grants, of April 5, 1644, were located in the area of the upper Champlain, in the western part of the municipality. Beginning in 1645, Jacques Hertel built a house on his land while continuing to live in Trois-Rivi√®res. Both of these land grants were divided into lots, beginning in 1666. =Grant of the Lordship of Champlain= According to a deed dated August 8, 1664, the Lordship of Champlain was granted to √âtienne P√©zard de la Tousche, Governor Augustine Saffray M√©zy and Bishop Fran√ßois de Montmorency-Laval. Its scope covered 1.5 lieue of frontage and one lieue deep, on both sides of the Champlain River. The lease did not mention a name given to the lordship. The act of ratification was issued by His Majesty on May 24, 1689. In 1665, the first land grants were contracted in the Lordship of Champlain. From 1668, manor residents said they lived in \\"La Touche-Champlain\\" which was simplified to \\"Champlain\\" in 1669. Twenty years after the creation of the Lordship of Champlain, in 1684, Monsignor Fran√ßois de Montmorency-Laval gave the official name to the Catholic parish as \\"Champlain\\", pointing out that this was the name in common use. The first lord was called \\"De la Touche-Champlain\\" in 1680, or \\"P√©zard Champlain\\" in 1693 or \\"P√©zard Latouche-Champlain\\" in 1702. A fort and a chapel were built between 1664 and 1665. The first acts were registered in 1665 in the parish registry. The first church was built between 1666 and 1671, to replace the chapel of Fort La Touche. In 1671, a flour mill was put into operation. In 1679, the town of Champlain had forty families with 250 people, some who had been established there ever since the founding of the lordship. The Lord was able to grant all the lots along the river's shore.Date of the founding of Champlain on August 8, 1664, article by Ren√© Beaudoin, historian The first increase in the territory of the lordship seems to have been granted before 1721 by the Jesuits, to √âtienne P√©zard de la Tousche according to Jean Bouffard. Another increase, with a range of three \\"lieues\\" deep, was granted on April 28, 1697, to Madame De la Tousche by the Governor, Louis Frontenac Buade, and the steward, Jean Bochart de Champigny. The ratification act was by His Majesty on May 28, 1700.Geographical Names Board of Canada - Register Place names - Lordship of Champlain =√âtienne P√©zard de la Tousch= √âtienne P√©zard de la Tousche, a military man, was born in Blois, Orleans, France, the son of Claude P√©zard and Marie Masson. He left France for Canada in 1661, and was immediately appointed a lieutenant, then captain, of the garrison at Trois-Rivi√®res. During this assignment, P√©zard gave assistance to Pierre Boucher in the drafting of the document \\"Histoire v√©ritable et, naturelle‚Ä¶\\" (real history and natural ...) (Paris, 1664).Pierre Boucher, book \\"Histoire v√©ritable et naturelle des m≈ìurs et production du pays de la Nouvelle-France, vulgairement dite le Canada\\" (Real and natural history of morals and production in the country of New France, commonly called Canada), Paris, 1664 - Historical Society of Boucherville, I, 1964 In June 1664, P√©zard left Trois-Rivi√®res to command the garrison at Montreal. He married Madeleine Mullois de La Borde on June 20, 1664, at Notre Dame Church in Montreal; they had five children. Although P√©zard was appointed governor of Montreal by Augustine Saffray M√©zy (on the same day as his marriage), this appointment never came into effect. The lords of Montreal opposed, alleging their right to appoint the Governor.Pierre-Georges Roy, book \\"Les Gouverneurs de Montr√©al\\" (The Governors of Montreal), BRH, XI (1905), p. 165. Following this setback, M√©zy granted P√©zard a manor on the north shore of St. Lawrence river on August 8, 1664. P√©zard immediately began to operate the Lordship, unlike the majority of the lords of his time. He immediately began construction of a mansion near the mouth of the Champlain River, on the edge of a rock and a church in 1665. This stately new concession exacerbated the Jesuits who believed their manorial fully vested on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River between the Saint-Maurice River and the Batiscan River. Meanwhile, the Jesuits actively pursued the settlement of Cap-de-la-Madeleine. Through his contacts with the authorities of Trois-Rivi√®res, as well as efforts among captains, established families, soldiers and immigrants, P√©zard attracted many pioneers to the lordship. He conceded 22 land grants in 1665. To thank P√©zard for his efforts in encouraging colonization, the steward gave him a \\"flight\\" from the royal stables.Jean Hamelin, biography, √âtienne P√©zard de la Tousche Champlain, Volume I (1000-1700) The date of P√©zard's death is unknown, and is not recorded in religious or civil records of New France. Historians conclude he died in 1696, based on documents that highlight his name in 1695. In addition, according to historian Jean Hamelin, documents written in November 1696 refer to the widow Mary Magdalene Mullois, who died in 1704.

It was written and produced by Timberlake, Timothy \\"Timbaland\\" Mosley and Jerome \\"J-Roc\\" Harmon, with additional writing from James Fauntleroy.  Writing and production  \\"Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want)\\" was written by Timberlake, Timothy \\"Timbaland\\" Mosley, Jerome \\"J-Roc\\" Harmon and James Fauntleroy. The song was produced by Timbaland, Timberlake and Harmon. Timberlake arranged and produced his vocals, which were recorded at Larabee Studios in North Hollywood, California. Harmon provided keyboards for the song, while Elliot Ives played the guitar. The track was engineered by Chris Godbey, with assistance from Alejandro Baima, and mixed by Jimmy Douglass, Godbey and Timberlake at Larabee Studios.  Composition and lyrical interpretation  \\"Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want)\\" is an electro-funk song with an approximate length of five minutes and fifteen seconds. Time magazine writer Chris Bosman cited the song as being an \\"extra-smooth\\" combination of the funk, pop and R&B; genres that shifts \\"unexpectedly from memorable moment to memorable moment\\". Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush cited \\"Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want)\\" as a \\"strangely compelling\\" pop song, and noted similarities between the song and the \\"sonic ethos\\" of Timberlake's second studio album, FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006). 411mania's Jeremy Thomas described the song as a \\"clear club hit\\" that oozes sensuality, while Paste Magazine's Holly Gleason cited it as an \\"epic dance track\\". Bosman declared \\"Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want)\\" to be a \\"classic Timberlake\\" song, although he felt that it is a \\"watered down\\" version of \\"Don't Hold the Wall‚Äù, the third track on Timberlake's third studio album, The 20/20 Experience (2013). \\"Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want)\\" opens with Timberlake singing a cappella about animalistic carnal desire, which Drowned in Sound writer Dave Hanratty noted to be a \\"note-perfect transition\\" from \\"Blue Ocean Floor\\", the closing track on The 20/20 Experience. The song then progresses into a more \\"nightclub- friendly environs\\" that fuses typical hip hop beats with a \\"syncopated backbone\\" of acidic funk and a guitar groove that Bosman found to be reminiscent of a stripped-down version of Daft Punk‚Äôs 2013 single ‚ÄúGet Lucky\\". Timberlake's vocals are supported by handclaps, blips, beeps and animal sounds. Lyrically, Timberlake urges his lover \\"to get closer to your animal inside\\". Thomas wrote that the song's lyrics are not subtle and noted that Timberlake has \\"never been about subtlety\\".  Critical response  Andrew Barker of Variety magazine wrote that \\"Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want)\\" opens the album effectively while being its \\"most winningly silly sexual imagery\\". On the other side, In a review of The 20/20 Experience - 2 of 2, Mesfin Fekadu of The Huffington Post stated that the album starts on the wrong note by using \\"Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want)\\" as its opener. Idolator's Carl Williott wrote that the song is a \\"clunky jungle-as-sex metaphor\\" that should have been erased when Bruno Mars's 2013 single \\"Gorilla\\" was released. Opposite, Melinda Newman of HitFix gave the song a grade A while describing it as a \\"sultry, sexy funky number\\" that introduces what is yet to come on the album. Chris Bosman of Time magazine cited ‚ÄúGimme What I Don‚Äôt Know (I Want)‚Äù as one of the album's best tracks. He, however, was critical of the song's extended outro, calling it an \\"awkward spoken word moment\\" that \\"slams the song‚Äôs already obvious metaphor of the bedroom as jungle into the beaten ground.\\" David Meller of MusicOMH wrote that \\"there‚Äôs nothing particularly striking\\" about the song, but that it's \\"competent enough\\".

Anshul has a younger brother Aakash (Adhyayan Suman), who is very attached to Anshul. However, Preeti's brothers Vishesh (Vishal Bhonsle) and Akhilesh (Manoj Harsh) disapprove of her love with Anshul, the son of an ordinary person. Due to their social status and clout, they threaten Anshul to stop the affair. Anshul does not pay heed and carries on with Preeti. The brothers hatch a plan and eliminate Anshul one night after a party. The heartbroken parents of Anshul and Aakash engage a lawyer and pay hefty fees but, due to lack of witnesses, they stand to lose the case. The police is also not helpful in the case. Due to the political pressure of Vishesh's father, who is a MLA, no witness is ready to testify before the police or in the court and the case is made of accident rather than deliberate cold blooded murder.

When their previous lawyer leaves their case, another lawyer Dipali Sinha (Ashwini Kalsekar) takes up the case as a challenge. The case drags on for 8 long years. In the meantime, Preeti's father becomes MP from MLA and their clout increases. Fearing trouble, Preeti, who is heart-broken after Anshul's death, is sent away to London by her parents so that she cannot break down and testify against her brothers in the court. Aakash gets this information and visits London to meet her but is denied meeting her by her custodians. He returns and informs Dipali, who tells the judge that she is a key witness and is required to be examined. On her request, the judge allows her to speak to Preeti by ISD call from the court. Dipali demands that Preeti be summoned before the court to which the judge agrees and orders that her visa be withdrawn and she be presented before the court for hearing. Preeti arrives home but is cautioned by her mother Mrs Thakur (Neelima Azeem) not to bring down the reputation and social status of the family and that she was going to contest the Assembly elections . Preeti is also pressurized by her family not to testify against her brothers and inform the court that she did not love Anshul. Under tremendous mental pressure, she testifies so before the judge.

In order to promote good health, they sell and market Yakult products while riding bicycles, motorcycles, or other automobiles. They wear the company's uniform, including a hat and a pair of gloves. Men such as Kazuhisa Ishii have also worked as Yakult \\"ladies\\". The Yakult lady home delivery system was introduced in 1963 while the Yakult Lady System started in 1981. There have been many cases in which a Yakult lady's social standing has become more like that of an entrepreneur than that of a part-time worker. They are fairly similar to retail stores licensed to sell the products by Yakult themselves. Yakult is sold in 31 countries around the world, but Yakult ladies only sell and distribute in Asian countries such as China, the Philippines and Indonesia, as well as Central and South American countries such as Brazil. Although Yakult is sold in Western countries, they do not have Yakult ladies. A trial of the Yakult lady system was introduced to Australia in 1994 but it was eventually disbanded.

Caro Quintero suspected Walker of working as an undercover U.S. Drug Enforcement Agent (DEA) while he lived in Guadalajara, Jalisco. Early life and career John Clay Walker was born in Washington D.C. at Walter Reed Hospital. In 1968, Walker enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. He was honorably discharged after being wounded twice in Vietnam, for which he received two Purple Hearts. Taking advantage of the G.I. Bill, Walker attended the University of Minnesota and earned a B.A. in Journalism in 1976. Throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, Walker worked as a reporter and photographer at small papers in Minnesota and Iowa. In 1983, Walker and his family relocated to Guadalajara, Mexico for a sabbatical year so that Walker could pursue a career as a novelist full-time. On January 30, 1985, John Walker and his friend Albert Radelat were planning on going to dinner at a Guadalajara restaurant when they accidentally walked into one of Rafael Caro Quintero's private parties. The two Americans were mistaken for DEA agents and taken to a store room. There they were interrogated and tortured with ice picks. Walker died on the scene from blunt force trauma to the head. Radelat was still alive when the men were wrapped in table cloths and taken to the San Isidro Mazatepec Park in Zapopan and buried. The bodies of the men were found six months later. The authorities believe that Caro Quintero had mistaken Walker and Radelat for U.S. undercover agents. Walker is survived by his wife and two daughters. He is buried at Ft. Snelling National Cemetery in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In popular culture Walker was portrayed in the series Narcos: Mexico by Brian Buckley.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1896146/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t90 His murder is depicted in the 7th episode: Jefe de Jefes.

Life and career  Georg Bohlmann went to school in Berlin and Leipzig and took his Abitur at the Wilhelms-Gymnasium in Berlin in 1888. After that, he began studying mathematics at the University of Berlin under Leopold Kronecker, Lazarus Fuchs, and Wilhelm Dilthey. As he advanced in his studies, Lie groups became the focus of his interest. Since this area was poorly represented at Berlin, he moved to the University of Halle, where he obtained his doctorate in 1892 under Albert Wangerin with a dissertation on the topic Ueber eine gewisse Klasse continuierlicher Gruppen und ihren Zusammenhang mit den Additionstheoremen (\\"On a certain class of continuous groups and their relation to addition theorems\\"). After that, he worked at the Meteorological Institute of Berlin, where presumably his interest in applied mathematics developed. At the invitation of Felix Klein, he moved to the University of G√∂ttingen, where he habilitated in 1894. In 1895, he was involved in starting a seminar on actuarial science at G√∂ttingen. However, since he held no permanent position there, he went to Berlin in 1903 to work as the Chief Actuary for the German subsidiary of the New York Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1901, he wrote the entry on life insurance mathematics in the Enzyklop√§die der mathematischen Wissenschaften (\\"Encyclopaedia of Mathematical Sciences\\") in which he gave axioms for probability theory long before Andrey Kolmogorov did so in 1933. In particular, he was the first to give the modern definition of statistical independence. Compared to the current structure of probability theory, his work only lacked the technical condition of sigma additivity. However, in contrast to Kolmogorov, Bohlmann failed to prove significant theorems within his axiomatic framework. As a result, his fundamental contributions to probability theory gained very little attention. In particular, though Kolmogorov had visited G√∂ttingen several times in the late 1920s, he had no knowledge of Bohlmann's work. Bohlmann was an invited speaker in the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1908 at Rome.√úber die Grundlagen der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung in ihrer Anwendung auf die Lebensversicherung.\\"Mr. Bohlmann forms a system of postulates from which theorems of the calculus of probability can be deduced logically. He examines the criteria of probability concerning the independence of events and demonstrates the sufficiency of the usually criterium. He formulates supplementary postulates necessary to define the survival functions of the mathematics of insurance and gives a relation between the survival functions of groups and those of individuals.\\" p. 28 of:  Publications  * Lebensversicherungsmathematik (Life Insurance Mathematics), Enzyklop√§die der Mathematischen Wissenschaften, 1901 * Continuierliche Gruppen von quadratischen Transformationen der Ebene (Continuous groups of quadratic transformations of the plane), G√∂ttinger Nachrichten, 1896, pp. 44‚Äì54 * Ein Ausgleichungsproblem (A stabilization problem), G√∂ttinger Nachrichten, 1899, pp. 260‚Äì271 * Die Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung in ihrer Anwendung auf die Lebensversicherung (The basic concepts of probability theory and its applications to life insurance), Atti del IV Congresso internazionale dei Matematici III, Rome 1909, pp. 244‚Äì278 * Anthropometrie und Lebensversicherung (Anthropometry and life insurance), Zeitschrift f√ºr die gesamte Versicherungs-Wissenschaft 14, 1914, pp. 743‚Äì786  References  * Ulrich Krengel, 100 Jahre Versicherungsmathematik an den Universit√§ten (100 years of actuarial science at universities), Bl√§tter der deutschen Gesellschaft f√ºr Versicherungsmathematik 22, 1996, p. 663 * Ulrich Krengel, On the contributions of Bohlmann to probability theory (PDF: 6.4 MB), Electronic Journal for History of Probability and Statistics, 2011 * Peter Koch, Geschichte der Versicherungswissenschaft in Deutschland (History of actuarial science in Germany), Verlag Versicherungswirtschaft, Karlsruhe 1998,  External links  * Geschichte der Stochastik in G√∂ttingen (History of Stochastics in G√∂ttingen), Ulrich Krengel and Axel Munk Category:20th-century German mathematicians Category:19th-century German mathematicians Category:Probability theorists Category:1869 births Category:1928 deaths ","title":"Georg Bohlmann"},{"id":"40245498","text":"The Museum of Archives () is a museum in Daan District, Taipei, Taiwan.

It was released by Liberation Music on 20 September 2013. Background and history Adalita first announced that she was writing for a new album via her blog in March 2012. The album was written and demoed throughout 2012 at various locations, including Melbourne, Sydney and Smiths Lake on the New South Wales central coast. This was, reportedly, a period of self-examination and personal growth for Adalita, with many of the songs centring on the 'disintegration of romantic relationships'. She also expressed that she wanted to work with a band for this album, marking the first time she's done so since Magic Dirt went on indefinite hiatus in 2010. Adalita announced on her Facebook page, in April 2013, that work had started on the album at Birdland Studios in Melbourne, with long-time Magic Dirt producer Lindsay Gravina. Matt Bailey (Paradise Motel) played bass on the album, while three different drummers ‚Äì Jim White from Dirty Three, Hugo Cran of The Devastations and Lee Parker of Spite House ‚Äì all contributed to the album. Also playing on the album is violinist, Willow Stahlut, whom Adalita encountered busking in Melbourne‚Äôs Bourke Street Mall and invited into the studio. Mixing of the album was completed in July 2013. In June, Adalita appeared on Australian television program RocKwiz and performed a track from the new album, entitled \\"I Want Your Love\\", a track that she has been playing live since 2010. In July 2013, she previewed the track \\"All Day Venus\\" and announced a small run of Australian east coast shows to preview the new material. During the first show, at The Tote venue in Melbourne, Victoria, she announced that the album is also titled All Day Venus. She told tonedeaf.com.au that the album ‚Äú[is] louder, and there‚Äôs much more distortion, the songs are bigger; there‚Äôs a lot more going on even though I‚Äôve still kept that minimal aesthetic.‚Äù She also stated that she chose Lindsay Gravina to produce the album because ‚Äúhe knows my evolution as a songwriter and how to bring out my best. Working solo is way more intense and I feel like I can really trust him with my music; something I don‚Äôt readily do. It‚Äôs certainly hard to get past my guard. But Lindsay can do it.‚Äù On 8 August, music website mess+noise announced that All Day Venus would be released on 20 September 2013. The album artwork and track listing were also revealed. The website also featured a link to the album's first single, 'Warm Like You', which premiered on Triple J the same day. Reception All Day Venus received generally positive reviews from critics upon its release.

It is held in Guwei'iyya yearly. In 2007, 250 owners participated, showing a total of more than 1,500 camels. Participants come from every Gulf country except Oman, and from every region of Saudi Arabia except the south-western mountain region, where there are no camel breeders. The competition is held in respect to the role of camels in Bedouin history, and to preserve purebred camel strains. No pageant is planned in 2020. Four varieties of camel participate in the show: the majaheem, which is black; the maghateer, which is white; the shi'l, which is dark brown; and the sufur, which is beige with black shoulders. There is strict health testing and veterinarians present at the event. The event is supported by the King and Crown Prince Sultan. Prizes are awarded to the most beautiful camels in four categories based on the number of camels entered by the owner: groups of 100, 50, 10, and individual camels. The beauty of the camel is based on the \\"size of its head; whether its lips cover its teeth, the length of its neck and the roundness of its hump\\" and \\"big eyes, long lashes and a long neck.\\" \\"The nose should be long and droop down, that's more beautiful [...] The ears should stand back, and the neck should be long. The hump should be high, but slightly to the back.\\" The most beautiful camel is called the \\"Bayraq\\" and can fetch prices of up to $3 million US dollars. In 2007, prizes included 10 million riyals and 72 sports utility vehicles. The winning camels may also sell for prices exceeding one million riyals. There are parts of the festival dedicated to camel trading, where millions of dollars change hands every day. Some members of more stringent Muslim schools have accused the shows as being evil, and have stated that those who participate should \\"seek redemption in God\\". In addition, some breeders refuse to take part in the competition, saying that it has become too commercial because wealthy businessmen, who have no interest in preserving the breeds and are only interested in fame, have started to enter. There are also dances, feasts, and parties during the festival, as well as youth camel shows. A similar contest in Abu Dhabi is the al-Dhafra Festival, which also awards prizes to the best milking camels and hosts camel races. This festival focuses on Asayel (local camels) and Majahim (dark skinned camels), and also features falcon hunting, Saluki and Arabian horse races, and date packing contests.

Background Selber was a son of a Jewish couple, Aaron R. Selber Sr. (1896‚Äì1968), a native of Baton Rouge, and the former Frances Dreyfuss (1900‚Äì2000). While growing up during the Great Depression, Selber developed his work ethic early, delivering the since defunct Shreveport Journal newspaper, selling the Saturday Evening Post, and servicing vending machines while attending elementary and junior high school at the private Southfield School and high school at the public C. E. Byrd, both in his native Shreveport. Selber graduated from Southfield School in 1940, one of the first graduates of the institution located at 1100 Southfield Road; in 2011, he was inducted into the Southfield Hall of Fame. Selber enrolled at Tulane University in New Orleans for one year before he joined the United States Army Air Forces, in which he obtained gained top secret clearance in the electronics section of the Strategic Air Command. After his military duty, Selber attended the School of Retailing at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. He then returned to Tulane where he graduated in 1950 with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree. He was subsequently inducted into the Paul Tulane Society. At Tulane, Selber met his future wife, the former Peggy Burkenroad (September 13, 1931 ‚Äì September 27, 2014). She was a New Orleans native, a daughter of Evelyn Kahn Levy and William B. Burkenroad Jr. (c. 1903‚Äì1995), and a graduate of the National Cathedral School in Washington, D.C. She attended H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College, the former sister institution to Tulane, and Centenary College in Shreveport. She was a board member of the Meadows Museum of Art at Centenary and the Sci-Port Discovery Center in Shreveport.

The first store was established in 1907 at 227 Texas Avenue in downtown Shreveport by Selber's grandfather, Charles Selber (born c. 1865 in Poland). In addition to Aaron Sr., there were three other Selber brothers, the uncles of Aaron Selber Jr. ‚Äì Isadore Selber (1887‚Äì1944), Louis Selber (1889‚Äì1968), and Mandel Charles Selber Sr. (1900‚Äì1967)Shreveport Times, December 9, 1967, p. 4-A Hence three of the four Selber Brothers died in the nine-month period between December 1967 and August 1968. Following the sale in 1988 of Selber Bros. to Dillard's Department Stores, Aaron Selber Jr. became for the remainder of his life an investor: \\"Cash rather than merchandise became my inventory.\\" Selbert attributed his optimistic business philosophy to the influence upon him from his father, his father-in-law William Burkenroad, and Jacob Aron, Burkenroad's business partner in New York City. The senior Aaron Selber had limited higher, having attended a business college, but he possessed an uncanny grasp of human nature. Billy Burkenroad made his fortune in the coffee business with Jacob Aron, and like the Selbers was a generous philanthropist. In 1978, Burkenroad switched the focus entirely of the J. Aron Company from years of coffee importation to the trading of commodities. Selber was a member of the National Retail Merchants and the Specialty Retail Stores associations. Aaron Selber, with his wife Peggy, was a large donor to many nonprofit organizations in both Shreveport and New Orleans. They established the Aaron or Peggy Selber Foundation in Shreveport and the Aaron and Peggy Selber Family Donor Advised Fund within the New Orleans Community Foundation. Selber was a former chairman of the board of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association of Louisiana. He was a director of Commercial National Bank at 333 Texas Avenue in Shreveport and a president of the Shreveport Jaycees and later the Chamber of Commerce. He was president of his alma mater, Southfield School, Goodwill Industries, and the Holiday in Dixie spring festival. He was a board member of Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center Shreveport, the Norwela Council of Boy Scouts of America, the American Red Cross, the Louisiana State Fair, YMCA, United Way, and the college football post-Christmas Independence Bowl, The Selbers were members of the B'nai Zion Congregation. Death and family Selber died in 2013 at the age of eighty- five at his Shreveport home of congestive heart failure. His motto was \\"Live your life in a wonderful way!\\" He was a member of the B'nai Zion Congregation in Shreveport. There are four Selber daughters, Patty Selber Newton and husband Carl of Baton Rouge, Pam Selber of Newport Beach, California, Polly Selber Gleichenhaus and husband Barry of Denver, Colorado, and Penny Selber Autenreith and husband Robert of New Orleans.

The nova appeared with a magnitude 6.8 when it was discovered and peaked at magnitude 4.3 on 16 August 2013.

This is the first direct evidence of the supply of lithium to the interstellar medium by an astronomical object. Lithium-7 is fragile in the environment at the center of a nova, so being blown out of the environment at the center is necessary for the observation of lithium.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1988 United States presidential election. Hawaii voters chose 4 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president. Hawaii was won by Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis who was running against incumbent United States Vice President George H. W. Bush of Texas. Dukakis ran with Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen as Vice President, and Bush ran with Indiana Senator Dan Quayle. Hawaii weighed in for this election as 17% more Democratic than the national average. Partisan background The presidential election of 1988 was a very partisan election for Hawaii, with 99% of the electorate voting for either the Democratic or Republican parties. All four of the Hawaiian island districts voted in majority for Dukakis. Republican national victory Dukakis won the election in Hawaii with a solid 10 point landslide. The election results in Hawaii stand out from most in the United States during this election. The nationwide electoral results are largely reflective of a nationwide political reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party, which took place through the 1980s. Through the passage of some very controversial economic programs, spearheaded by then President Ronald Reagan (called, collectively, \\"Reaganomics\\"), the mid-to-late 1980s saw a period of economic growth and stability. The hallmark for Reaganomics was, in part, the wide- scale deregulation of corporate interests, and tax cuts for the wealthy. Dukakis ran his campaign on a socially liberal platform, and advocated for higher economic regulation and environmental protection. Bush, alternatively, ran on a campaign of continuing the social and economic policies of former President Reagan - which gained him much support with social conservatives and people living in rural areas. Additionally, while the economic programs passed under Reagan, and furthered under Bush and Clinton, may have boosted the economy for a brief period, they are criticized by many analysts as \\"setting the stage\\" for economic troubles in the United States after 2007, such as the Great Recession.

Cribb's brother Benjamin Cribb also served as a member of the colonial parliaments of both New South Wales and Queensland. Early life Cribb was born in 1805 in the town of Poole, Dorset, England into a rigidly Nonconformist family. Cribb's father, John Galpin Cribb, was a mariner and ship owner, operating to Newfoundland and the Mediterranean; young Robert and his brother Benjamin sometimes accompanied their father. However, this ended when their father was killed in action during the Napoleonic Wars. Following his father's death, Cribb's mother Mary Cribb (n√©e Dirham) apprenticed Robert and his brother Benjamin to two merchants. By 1832, Robert had settled in Covent Garden where he owned a local bakery. By the age of 22, Robert had married Sarah Sanson of Wareham. Cribb held views that were considered radical at the time, and was a committed member of the Anti-Corn Law League, as well as being a follower of radical politicians Richard Cobden and John Bright. After reading John Dunmore Lang's work \\"Cooksland,\\" Robert emigrated to Australia aboard the Fortitude with his wife, four of his five children, and three other relatives, arriving on 20 January 1849. Establishing in Brisbane Robert Cribb (white haired) and others, in front of Cribb's Dunmore House on River Road (now Coronation Drive), circa 1886 Upon his arrival in Australia, Cribb settled in Brisbane where he first acquired a bakery on Queen Street between Edward and Albert streets, and then extensive landholdings around the growing city. In March 1852, Robert Cribb purchased land around the area of Cribb Street, Milton today; the street bears his name today. In December 1853, he bought 39 acres in what is today the suburb of Auchenflower. The land was bordered by Western Creek (now mostly culvertised), Indooroopilly Road (now Milton Road), the River Road (now Coronation Drive) alongside the Brisbane River and Chasely Street. He called this Lang Farm (in honour of John Dunmore Lang) and he grew oranges, potatoes, cabbages, mulberries and olives. He built a house called Dunmore (again honouring John Dunmore Lang) on River Road close to where Lang Parade intersects today. On 15 October 1857, his wife Sarah died at Ipswich aged 57 years. On 1 August 1860, he married for a second time to Sarah Walton in Ipswich, but she died on 3 January 1870 and was buried in Toowong Cemetery. Politics Robert Cribb became involved in local politics, earning the nickname \\"Robert the Restless\\" from the local press due to his nonconformist liberal and radical views. He was elected as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly representing the seat of East Moreton in June 1859, serving briefly until the seat was abolished due to the separation of the new colony of Queensland from New South Wales on 10 December 1859. During this time he also served as an alderman on the Brisbane Municipal Council from 1859 to 1861. Cribb was then elected at a by-election to be one of three members for the seat of Town of Brisbane, which took in areas of Brisbane north of the Brisbane River, following the resignation from Parliament of Henry Jordan. He represented this district until 1863, when he switched to the seat of East Moreton, which covered much of the area of the south-east corner of the colony, excluding the areas around the settlements of Brisbane and Ipswich. On 17 February 1870, Arthur Francis, member for East Moreton, resigned due to insolvency, and a by- election was called. On the nomination day, 19 February 1870, there were two candidates: Cribb and Robert Travers Atkin. In his nomination speech, Atkin made accusations against Cribb, who replied vigorously defending himself. The somewhat unexpected outcome of this verbal exchange was that Cribb announced he would withdraw his nomination. Cribb said that if Atkin believed he could represent them so well, the best thing they could do would be to let him try, predicting that Atkin would either resign or be asked to resign within six months. Being the only remaining candidate, Atkin was declared elected. Cribb's six-month prediction did not come true. However, Atkin did not complete his term, as he resigned on 7 March 1872 due to serious ill health (pulmonary tuberculosis). Although Brisbane had a municipal council since 1859, the area within that local authority was quite small and it was not until 1879 that local government was established in the area where Robert Cribb lived. In 1879 he would have been living within the Indooroopilly Division but shortly after in 1880 eastern part of Indooroopilly Division (the more populated districts) were separated to create the Shire of Toowong. Robert Cribb was a councillor of the shire from 21 June 1880 to 1 February 1881, representing the South Ward, and then a much longer period of service from 7 February 1882 to 4 February 1890, also representing the South Ward. He was president of the shire from 1885 to 1887. Although he stood for election to the shire council in both 1890 and 1891, he was unsuccessful. Cribb was a founder of the Queensland Liberal Association, and advocated strongly for the separation of Queensland from New South Wales, and for the abolition of forced labour within the new colony, whether by kanakas, convicts, or indentured labourers. Consistent with Nonconformist beliefs, he vigorously supported the separation of Church and State. He also sought to allow a man to marry his deceased wife's sister (which was then forbidden). He was committed to Chartism. Like Cribb, his brother Benjamin was also a member of both the NSW and Queensland parliaments, while two of his nephews Thomas, and James, also served in the Queensland Parliament. Later life Robert Cribb died in his home Dunmore on River Road (now Coronation Drive) on 16 April 1893. He was buried on 17 April 1893 at Toowong Cemetery.

She was the first American woman to complete the Whitbread Round the World Race and famously survived a boating accident in 1982 off the coast of North Carolina, which became the subject of TV shows, books and films. Biography Deborah Scaling Kiley was born January 21, 1958, in Throckmorton, Texas. She took up sailing at an early age and began working as a crew member on yachts. In 1981, she became the first American woman to complete the Whitbread Round the World Race, working as a cook on the South African Xargo.Laurence Gonzales, Deep Survival: Who Lives, Who Dies, and Why, Chapter 11 \\"We're All Going To Fucking Die!\\", W. W. Norton & Company, 2004 In October, 1982, she was hired to crew a 58-foot sailing yacht called the Trashman for a routine Maine to Florida transfer. From Maine, they stopped over in Annapolis, Maryland and left for the next leg when the boat was overtaken by unexpected heavy weather in the Gulf Stream off the coast of North Carolina. The Trashman foundered in 40‚Äì50' seas and sank. The five crew members gathered on an 11-foot Zodiac and began to die: two drank sea-water, became delusional, left the Zodiac, and were eaten by sharks; and the third had an agonizing death from infected wounds suffered during the sinking. Five days after the sinking, Kiley and the other surviving crew member were rescued by a passing Soviet cargo ship \\"Olenegorsk\\" and presented to US authorities. The shipwreck was transformative for Kiley who went on to write a popular account of the incident called Albatross: The True Story of a Woman's Survival at Sea (1994) which was made into a TV film, Two Came Back; and profiled in the episode \\"Shark Survivor\\" on the Discovery channel series I Shouldn't Be Alive (Ep. 1, Se. 1, 2005-08-10); and in the episode \\"Danielle/Deborah/Gordy & Betty\\" of the series I Survived... (Ep. 17, Se. 3, 2010-09-12). She became a motivational speaker, appeared on Larry King Live (CNN), and published another book No Victims Only Survivors in 2006 about lessons for surviving. In 2019, Discovery Channel released a made-for-TV movie lightly based on the events of the shipwreck titled Capsized: Blood in the Water. Personal life Deborah Scaling was married to John Coleman Kiley III, and was later married to Greg Blackmon from 2005‚Äì2008. Both marriages concluded in divorces and in the case of Blackmon there were charges of domestic violence. She had two children: her daughter, Marka Kiley, and son, John \\"Quatro\\" Kiley IV, who died in a drowning accident in 2009. Deborah Scaling Kiley died August 13, 2012 in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, where she had recently moved.

The museum is located at National Cheng Kung University. History The idea for a museum came in 1999, when Po-Yih Hsu pledged to donate his collection of historical artifacts to the University. President Cheng-I Weng and Vice President Hung-Shan Weng saw the opportunity for building a museum that would also exhibit the collection in the university's possession. The campus had mechanical artifacts like ancient locks, mineral samples, animal and botanical samples, historical artifacts, and works of art like calligraphy and paintings. In July 1999, a team was formed to oversee the establishment of the museum. On February 1, 2000 the team began work of collecting and recording the artifacts to be put on display. The first major contribution to the museum was made by Mr Po-Yih Hsu in autumn of 2000. He donated 2,412 pieces of artifacts. The collection contained 1,823 pottery and ceramics, 202 stone sculptures, 112 wood sculptures, 102 puppets, 115 religious paintings, 21 bamboo woven handicraft articles, and a few objects of iron, plastic and tin. A few years later, in 2003, the building on Cheng Kung Campus, which had been occupied by the Japanese from 1895‚Äì1945, was turned into the museum's office and exhibition room. A research team composed of various scholars and experts then selected 516 items from Mr. Po-Yih Hsu's large collection. The museum was officially opened in November 2006, the year the university entered its 76th year. Architecture Front view of the National Cheng Kung University Museum.

Geology  The hill is formed from a succession of mudstones and siltstones laid down by turbidity currents during the Ordovician Period. The main ridge is developed in rocks of the Ceiswyn Formation assigned to the Ogwen Group and dating from around 457 to 454 million years ago.

She was invested the empress in 954 when her husband Guo Rong (Chai Rong) became the second Later Zhou emperor. Three years after her death, Guo Rong married her younger sister when he fell critically ill. Originally the wife of Li Chongxun (ÊùéÂ¥áË®ì), she was widowed in 949 following a narrow escape from death. After Chai was also widowed in 950, they married through the arrangement of Chai's adoptive father and Later Zhou's founding emperor Guo Wei. First marriage to Li Chongxun When Lady Fu was a teenager, her father Fu Yanqing was a military governor for the Later Han. He arranged for her to marry fellow military governor Li Shouzhen's son Li Chongxun (ÊùéÂ¥áË®ì). In 948, Li Shouzhen and Li Chongxun rebelled against the Later Han government, and another military governor, Guo Wei, was tasked to suppress the mutiny. After months of battles, in 949 Li Shouzhen was defeated and committed suicide. Following suit, Li Chongxun first killed his siblings, but as he prepared to kill his wife, she hid under the curtains of her bedroom. Unable to find her in a hurry, Li Chongxun killed himself. When Guo Wei's soldiers stormed into the house, they saw a young girl (Lady Fu was only 18) calmly sitting in the reception hall. She declared, \\"The gentleman Guo Wei is an old acquaintance of my father's. Your sort would be wise not to violate me!\\" It proved to be effective as no Later Han soldier dared to approach her. Later, Guo personally assured her that he would not harm her and would return her to her family safely. The young girl was so grateful that from then on she regarded the senior commander as her godfather. Second marriage to Chai Rong In 951, Guo Wei and his nephew-in-law Chai Rong were station at Weizhou (È≠èÂ∑û; today's Linzhang County, Hebei) when the Later Han emperor Liu Chengyou killed their entire families left behind in the capital Bianzhou (Ê±¥Â∑û; today's Kaifeng, Henan). Guo led his troops to attack the capital, and after the death of Liu Chengyou, declared himself the emperor of the new Later Zhou. Having lost his wife and children to the senseless killing, Chai Rong was looking for another mate. He had been quite impressed by Lady Fu's story, presumably having also met her due to their close associations with Guo Wei. Lady Fu was also looking for a second marriage. Her mother had advised her to shave her head and become a nun following her miraculous escape from death, but she refused, stating, \\"Why should I deform my own body and hair?\\" At the arrangement of Guo, she married Chai, 10 years her senior.

During the latter tournament Aguinaldo was involved in a fair bit of controversy in the first leg of the semi-final as Thai striker Adisak Kraisorn was sent off for an off the ball altercation with the Filipino defender. It appeared that Aguinaldo might have provoked the confrontation and afterwards he and other Filipino footballers received threats from Thai fans. Personal life Aguinaldo is an only child of Ariel and Maida Aguinaldo who both had roots to Davao. His name Amani is derived from an African title meaning both \\"warrior\\" and \\"peace\\". He was born in Las Pi√±as, but due to his parent's professions his family moved to Cebu and then Davao City where Aguinaldo spent most of his childhood, before moving back to the Manila area where he attended high school. Aguinaldo took up football from his father at the age of five, and nine years later he was called up to the Philippines U-14 by future Loyola coach Kim Chul-soo. At the age of 16 Aguinaldo was selected to play for the u-21 side at the 2012 Hassanal Bolkiah Trophy. During the tournament Aguinaldo was roomed with twins Marwin and Marvin and became good friends with both. His favorite teams are Manchester City, Bayern Munich, A.C. Milan, and Real Madrid, although his favorite footballer is Lionel Messi.

All 50 states and the District of Columbia, were part of the 1988 United States presidential election. State voters chose 11 electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president. Wisconsin was won by Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis who was running against incumbent United States Vice President George H. W. Bush of Texas. Dukakis ran with Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen as Vice President, and Bush ran with Indiana Senator Dan Quayle. Wisconsin weighed in for this election as 12 points more Democratic than the national average. , this is the last election in which Green County voted for a Republican presidential candidate. This was also the first time since 1960 that Wisconsin would back the losing candidate in a presidential election. Partisan background The presidential election of 1988 was a very partisan election for Wisconsin, with over 99 percent of the electorate voting for either the Republican or Democratic parties, although five additional candidates were on the ballot. Republican national victory Dukakis won the election in Wisconsin with a 4-point margin. The state has since consistently voted for the Democratic Party, until the narrow victory of Republican Donald Trump in 2016. The narrow election results in the rapidly liberalizing state of Wisconsin are reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party, which took place through the 1980s. Through the passage of some very controversial economic programs, spearheaded by then President Ronald Reagan (called, collectively, \\"Reaganomics\\"), the mid-to-late 1980s saw a period of economic growth and stability. The hallmark for Reaganomics was, in part, the wide-scale deregulation of corporate interests, and tax cuts for the wealthy. Dukakis ran his campaign on a socially liberal platform, and advocated for higher economic regulation and environmental protection. Bush, alternatively, ran on a campaign of continuing the social and economic policies of former President Reagan ‚Äì which gained him much support with social conservatives and people living in rural areas, who largely associated the Republican Party with the economic growth of the 1980s. Additionally, while the economic programs passed under Reagan, and furthered under Bush and Clinton, may have boosted the economy for a brief period, they are criticized by many analysts as \\"setting the stage\\" for economic troubles in the United State after 2007, such as the Great Recession.

It is defined as 0.1 to 10 THz (wavelengths of 3 mm to 30 ¬µm). Currently, at frequencies within this range, useful power generation and receiver technologies are inefficient and unfeasible. Mass production of devices in this range and operation at room temperature (at which energy is equal to the energy of a photon with a frequency of 6.2 THz) are mostly impractical. This leaves a gap between mature microwave technologies in the highest frequencies of the radio spectrum and the well- developed optical engineering of infrared detectors in their lowest frequencies. This radiation is mostly used in small-scale, specialized applications such as submillimetre astronomy. Research that attempts to resolve this issue has been conducted since the late 20th century. Closure of the terahertz gap Most vacuum electronic devices that are used for microwave generation can be modified to operate at terahertz frequencies, including the magnetron, gyrotron, synchrotron, and free electron laser. Similarly, microwave detectors such as the tunnel diode have been re- engineered to detect at terahertz and infrared frequencies as well. However, many of these devices are in prototype form, are not compact, or exist at university or government research labs, without the benefit of cost savings due to mass production. Research Ongoing investigation has resulted in improved emitters (sources) and detectors, and research in this area has intensified. However, drawbacks remain that include the substantial size of emitters, incompatible frequency ranges, and undesirable operating temperatures, as well as component, device, and detector requirements that are somewhere between solid state electronics and photonic technologies. Free- electron lasers can generate a wide range of stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation from microwaves, through terahertz radiation to X-ray. However, they are bulky, expensive and not suitable for applications that require critical timing (such as wireless communications). Other sources of terahertz radiation which are actively being researched include solid state oscillators (through frequency multiplication), backward wave oscillators (BWOs), quantum cascade lasers, and gyrotrons.

Doty argues that the concept of pheromone introduced by Karlson and L√ºscher is too simple for mammalian chemonsensory systems, failing to take into account learning and the context-dependence of chemosensation. In this book, he is especially critical of human pheromones, arguing that not only are there no definitive studies finding human pheromones, but that humans lack a functional vomeronasal organ to detect pheromones. Its publication received coverage in the news media, especially concerning its arguments that human pheromones do not exist. The pheromone concept Karlson and L√ºscher defined pheromones \\"..as substances which are secreted to the outside by an individual and received by a second individual of the same species in which they release a specific reaction, for example, a definite behaviour or a developmental process\\" (p. 55). To distinguish pheromones from other substances that can stimulate behaviors such as the scents of flowers or food odors, they emphasize that pheromones are \\"special messenger substances\\" such as sexual attractants in butterflies and moths. In their definition, pheromones are analogous to hormones such as testosterone or oxytocin, which are specific compounds. However, while hormones serve as chemical messengers within an individual organism, pheromones carry messages between individuals. While the pheromone concept applies reasonably well to insects, Doty argues that there are serious problems with its application to mammals. The functions of pheromones, as specific types of compounds, are to produce unlearned, reflexive, and innate responses in recipients. Doty, however, argues that the chemical stimuli that mammals respond to are typically combinations of many compounds, that are sensed in complex social situations, and experience and learning are important for how mammals respond to chemical stimuli. For example, the Vandenbergh effect in mice occurs when puberty-accelerating pheromones are released in the urine of male mice. Doty shows that the effect depends on experience, that multiple compounds found in male mouse urine are involved in the effect, and the effect is not species specific since urine from male rats will also cause puberty acceleration in young female mice. Human pheromones He argues that there is little or no scientific basis for human pheromones in the scientific literature. The vomeronasal organ, which is the sensory organ that takes in pheromone compounds in mammals such as mice and rats is a vestigial organ in humans. Menstrual synchrony has long been viewed as a physiological phenomenon in humans that could only be explained by the exchange of pheromones among women. He argues, however, that methodological critiques of menstrual cycle research and recent research indicate the menstrual synchrony does not occur among women. Finally, he reviews the literature on human pheromones and argues that there are serious methodological issues in all studies reporting human pheromones and that no human pheromone has ever been definitively identified. His conclusion is that human pheromones are a myth that is driven in part by economics. What he calls the \\"junk-science industry of pheromone-perfumes, pheromone-soaps, and pheromone cosmetics\\" arose from misunderstood research with mammals. For example, androstenedione is a steroid hormone that is found in human sweat and is the main ingredient in commercially sold human pheromone products, but scientific research provides little evidence that it functions as a pheromone. Doty cites a study in which women sniffed sweaty T-shirts of men. The women preferred T-shirts worn by men whose immune system genes were most different from them, indicating that it was the mixture of genes a man had that was the important factor in which sweaty T-shirt a woman preferred and not the androstenedione secreted in his sweat. Androstenedione is produced by pigs in abundance. Doty quips: \\"Are women, in fact, attracted to the odors of male pigs or more willing to have sex in the presence of such odors? Are birth rates or other indices of sexual behavior higher in states or counties with pig farms?\\" Critical response The book has generally been received well by the scientific community. According to Doty, those critical of the book range from people who refuse to read it to those who have semantic issues with the pheromone concept and its applicability to mammals. Peter Brennan argues that Doty does not consider some of the more recent scientific research that conflicts with his views. He cites a 2010 study in mice that reports the discovery of a urinary protein that attracts female mice. Brennan concludes: \\"I suspect that the majority of researchers will continue to use the term [pheromone], despite all of its shortcomings. But after reading this book, I will certainly be more circumspect when referring to pheromones in future.\\" References Category:Pheromones Category:Endocrinology ","title":"The Great Pheromone Myth"},{"id":"40246644","text":"Daykey High School (ÎåÄÍ∏∞Í≥†Îì±ÌïôÍµê,Â§ßËµ∑È´òÁ≠âÂ≠∏Ê†°) is a private high school located in Jeju, South Korea.

In Mexico He was born in Carpi, Emilia-Romagna, and worked as a set designer and painter at La Scala in Milan before studying perspective, painting, and theater design at the Milan Academy of Arts in about 1834‚Äì1835. His new occupation as scene painter enabled him to travel to Mexico around 1838 with an Italian opera company. After his 13 years in Mexico, he lived in New Orleans for the rest of his life. As Pedro Gualdi in Mexico, he was a prolific artist, sketching and painting Mexico City's architecture, landmarks, and scenery.James Oles, art and Architecture in Mexico. London: Thames & Hudson, 2013, p. 181. He produced an album of lithographs, \\"Monumentos de M√©jico\\" which was published by Mass√© y Decaen of Mexico City in 1841. He taught perspective at the Academia de San Carlos in Mexico City in 1850, having Casimiro Castro as one of his students. He \\"created precise renditions of major monuments and urban spaces what are not about exotic strangeness but instead emphasize the capital's grandeur and order.\\"Oles, Mexican Art and Architecture, p. 181. In 1841 he produced a valuable historical document in the form of a book of lithographs titled \\"Monumentos de Mejico, tomados del natural y litografiados por Pedro Gualdi pintor de perspectiva obsequio a los se√±ores abonados\\", lithographed and published by Agust√≠n Mass√© and Jean Decaen Callejon. The thirteen plates portrayed the 'Catedral', 'Plaza de So. Domingo y Aduana', 'Exterior de Na. Sa. de Guadalupe', 'Interior de la Universidad', 'Interior de la Mineria', 'Colegio de Mineria', 'Interior de Catedral', 'Santuario de Na. Sa. de Guadalupe', 'Paseo de la Independencia', 'Patio del convento de Na, S. de la Merced', 'Camara de los Diputados' and the 'Casa Municipal'. The book proved so popular that a second revised edition was published in 1841-42. In 1842 he produced an oil painting panorama of Mexico City that resulted in four lithographs of the city as seen from the tower of the church of St. Augustine. He made sketches and paintings of U.S. troops entering Mexico City in the War of 1846‚Äì48. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Gualdi‚Äôs work was copied by some U.S. publishers, both to help the war effort and for profit, a view of the Military College at Chapultepec and a bird‚Äôs-eye view of the Z√≥calo of Mexico City having military value. Gualdi worked with Agust√≠n Mass√©, J. Decaen, and Michaud on the ca. 1851 \\"Album Pintoresco de la Rep√∫blica Mexicana\\".Dorothy Sloan Books\\"Pioneer Photographers from the Mississippi to the Continental Divide: A Biographical Dictionary, 1839-1865\\" - Peter E. Palmquist, Thomas R. Kailbourn In New Orleans Gualdi seems to have moved to New Orleans by December 1851, where in March 1854 he displayed his sweeping panorama of the city. It was an oil painting measuring 20 by 128 feet, shown in an octagonal building designed by Gualdi himself and located at the corner of St. Charles and Poydras Streets. He had worked on the panorama from January to March 1853, using the lofty tower of St. Patrick‚Äôs Church as a vantage point. Newspapers hailed the painting that showed some ten miles of surrounding countryside and depicted the buildings of the city ‚Äúwith wonderful accuracy.‚Äù The First Presbyterian Church of New Orleans commissioned Gualdi in 1855First Presbyterian Church; It's Buildings and Ministers by Samuel Wilson, Jr, F.A.I.A (1988) p. 31 to render a large gouache painting of Henry Howard's design for their new sanctuary which was erected facing Lafayette Square (demolished in 1938 to erect the Federal Building). His last known work was to design a circular marble tomb for the Italian Mutual Benevolent Society in St. Louis Cemetery I in New Orleans, and he was one of the first to be entombed there after dying from malaria.

It is commonly known as the twostripe goby, black-lined sleeper goby, or railway sleeper goby. It can grow up to a length of and is distinguishable by two prominent orange to black lines running longitudinally through its body. Taxonomy Twostripe gobies were first described by the Dutch ichthyologist Pieter Bleeker in 1858 as Eleotriodes helsdingenii. The type specimens were originally collected from Pulau-Pulau Gorong, Maluku, Indonesia. It belongs to the hover goby genus Valenciennea in the true goby family, Gobiidae. The specific name honours the Dutch civil servant W. F. C. van Helsdingen, who provided Bleeker with a number of well-preserved fish specimens from the Gorong Archipelago in the Dutch East Indies, including the type specimen of this species. Description The body of twostripe gobies is elongated and laterally compressed. They are commonly in length, with a maximum length of . The body is predominantly white to pale gray in color, with the dorsal surface a darker brownish gray. It has two prominent orange, dark red, reddish-brown, or black lines running longitudinally on the sides of its body, darkest at the anterior end and growing lighter towards the back. The upper line begins from the front of the snout, goes through the eye, and ends at the tip of the upper fork of the caudal fin. The lower line is parallel to the upper line and begins from the side of the upper lip, through the middle of the base of pectoral fins, and ends at the tip of the lower fork of the caudal fin. Both upper and lower lines are outlined in white at the caudal fin. A large oval black spot is also present between the third and fifth spines of the dorsal fin. The pelvic fins are completely separated, no membrane is present between the first and the second dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin is shallow and its margin rounded, and the fourth spine is slightly longer than the other spines. The caudal fin in adults is deeply notched with two long filaments. Juveniles have more rounded caudal fins. Ecology Twostripe gobies are relatively rare. They usually occur in pairs, but can be found alone in silty flat sand patches or rubble substrates. They are usually found on outer reefs at the bottom of coral or rocky dropoffs, rarely in lagoons. They feed on small digging (fossorial) organisms by sifting them from mouthfuls of sand. Eggs hatch two days after spawning and the larvae reach lengths of after 35 days. Juveniles are usually found near rocks in clear estuaries. The fish is carnivore, feeding on small invertebrates. Distribution Twostripe gobies have a wide distribution range. They can be found in the temperate and tropical waters of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. From the coast of East Africa, the southern Red Sea, the Maldives, southeast India and Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, Australia, western Oceania, and Japan.

It was founded in 1952 by Professor Chan Hoi Ying with the simple mission that is to design the HKAFA Curriculum for the contemporary student based on traditional methods of art instruction. Over the years, the Academy has produced many successful alumni and has many notable achievements.  History  The Hong Kong Academy of Fine Art's history can be traced back to the 1800s when Professor Chan Hoi-Ying's teacher, Li Tiefu, began learning his trade from the two famed American painters; John Singer Sargent and William Merritt Chase. When Li returned from overseas, he discovered the very talented Chan Hoi-Ying and took him under his wing. The two grew very close during Chan's 18 years under Li's tutelage and Professor Chan Hoi-Ying later claimed that much of his philosophy behind art and the Hong Kong Academy of Fine Arts were inherited from his mentor.

It lies south of the town of Pedra Badejo, on the north-east coast of the island. The lagoons are of great ecological value for birds as they contain fresh or only slightly brackish water. They have been recognised as a wetland of international importance by designation under the Ramsar Convention since 2005. The area around the lagoons is intensively cultivated with coconuts, sugarcane, bananas, cassava and various vegetables. The lagoons, which hold water all year, lie at the mouth of three seasonal watercourses which, when in flood during the wet season, deposit large amounts of mud and debris in the lagoons, making them attractive to water birds such as waders and herons. The site also supports a population of endangered Cape Verde warblers and has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

The Kedron Division was one of those initially established on 11 November 1879, but on 3 November 1883 the Toombul Division was separated from the Kedron Division. Following agitation by Toombul board member Andrew Lang Petrie, the Hamilton Division was then separated from the Toombul Division on 2 October 1890 and Petrie become its first chairman. In 1902, the Local Authorities Act 1902 replaced all divisions with towns and shires, creating the Shire of Hamilton on 31 March 1903. In 1904, it was proclaimed the Town of Hamilton. In 1925, it was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane. Hamilton Town Hall The Hamilton Town Hall was built in 1920 and is located at the north-west corner of the intersection of Racecourse Road and Rossiter Street, Hamilton. After the amalgamation into the City of Brisbane, the Hamilton Town Hall was used as a School of Arts. In World War II it was used by the Australian Army. After the war, the Hamilton branch of the Brisbane City Council library was located in the building, a role which continues to the present day. There are also meeting rooms available for use by community groups. The town hall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 2005.

The season opened on 11 April and concluded on 3 October with the 1981 WAFL Grand Final between Claremont and South Fremantle. It was the last WAFL season to begin in April and end in October; from 1982 the league shifted the schedule of the season forward by a week and in later years by another. The 1981 WAFL season is famous because of its prodigious scoring, chiefly by premiers Claremont and runners-up South Fremantle. The Claremont trio of Warren Ralph, and brothers Jimmy and Phil Krakouer broke numerous records related to scoring in single matches and seasons. (It was to be the Krakouer brothers' last season at Claremont, before a move to North Melbourne, where they introduced an attacking style of football to the VFL.) During 1981, the 1979 record score by Swan Districts was broken twice, with the last round record by South Fremantle still remaining as the highest score in senior WAFL history. The average score of 123 points per team per game is the highest in WAFL history and as much as ten points higher than the VFL/AFL maximum during 1982, whilst tailender Perth set the unenviable record of conceding 157 points per match, allowing under 100 only on a very wet day against East Perth.

The film stars Nicholas Hoult, Elle Fanning, Michael Shannon and Kodi Smit-McPhee. The film had its world premiere at 2014 Sundance Film Festival on January 18, 2014. The film was released on October 17, 2014 in the United States. Plot In a post-drought apocalypse United States, people kill for water. Ernest Holm lives with his son Jerome and daughter Mary in their small townhouse and field. His wife has been involved in an accident earlier and is now permanently hospitalized in a facility where she can walk while wired to a special frame. While everyone else has left the area, Ernest and his family remain, as Ernest believes that the land will grow once more if only there is irrigation. Ernest gets water for his family by delivering supplies to the \\"water men\\" who extract water from deep wells through a government deal. When his mule breaks its legs and he has to kill it, Ernest goes to Sam Lever's auction house and buys a robotic carrier machine called Simulit Shadow (\\"Sim\\") to replace it, beating the offers of Flem Lever, Sam's son, a young, troubled man who has been seeing Mary without Ernest's consent. One morning, Ernest finds the Sim is missing, and he goes looking for it. When he gets to the water men, he is accused of stealing their supplies. He finds Flem transporting the stolen supplies with the Sim; Flem plans to sell them at the border. Ernest takes Flem captive, ties him to the machine, and aims to take the supplies back to the water men. When they stop due to dehydration, Flem convinces Ernest to rehydrate with the liquor they are transporting. Wanting to escape, Flem throws a stone at Ernest's head and frames the machine for Ernest's death. Flem marries Mary after helping the family obtain illegal irrigation from the water men, thus saving their farm, which was originally Flem's father's. But after finding out Ernest had overwhelming debts to repay to a bank, which is now going to repossess the farm, Flem tricks his friend Robbie into selling his baby behind his wife's back. Robbie is killed and the Sim is lost in an altercation with the buyers. However, the machine returns limping and mangled to its manufacturer, who resides in a city across the border. The owner, Calvin Hooyman, reaches Jerome at the Holm residence via CB radio, informing him about the machine. Jerome crosses the border with the help of Anna, a girl who lives with the \\"settlers\\", people fighting back against the government's regulations and considered terrorists. Jerome meets Calvin, who gives the repaired Sim back to him, and shows Jerome how the machine's laser sensor behaves like a rudimentary video recorder. Jerome plays the recording and finds the truth about Ernest's death. Arriving home before Flem, Jerome questions him as to how the machine found its way home, since Flem claimed to have sold it in order to repay the debt. Flem's lies only infuriate Jerome more, but at first he takes no action. Instead, he lures Flem out in the desert by posing as Robbie via radio and letters, ultimately causing Flem to fall into a pit trap and break his legs. As Flem cries for help, Jerome, who has been secretly following him, comes at the pit's mouth. Flem realizes that Jerome knows about what happened to Ernest. He tries to elicit Jerome's mercy, but Jerome coldly shoots him in the head. Jerome ultimately decides to withhold these events and the circumstances of Ernest's death from Mary, who is pregnant with Flem's child. Brother and sister remain in the house, planning to bring their mother there from the hospital now that they can pay for her brace wires, and wishing the baby will be a girl. The film is divided into three chapters, named after the main character in each of them: \\"Ernest Holm\\", \\"Flem Lever\\", and \\"Jerome Holm\\", respectively.

By 1886, the residents of subdivision 1 were petitioning to separate and become the Shire of Windsor, resulting in the establishment of the Shire of Windsor on 11 Feb 1887. Meanwhile, the residents of subdivision 2 were petitioning to separate and become the Shire of Ithaca, resulting in the creation of the Shire of Ithaca on 18 Aug 1887. The now much depleted Ithaca Division then requested to be renamed the Enoggera Division and this occurred on 28 Mar 1888. The Local Authorities Act 1902 replaced divisions with shires and towns. As a result, on 31 Mar 1903, the Enoggera Division became the Shire of Enoggera.

It fabricates and sells a large range of medical and diagnostics needles. Its headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland. Since 1958, its logo represents a medical needle hub and was created by the founder Mr. Karl Schoenholzer.  Historical Introduction  In 1936, Mr. Pierre-Jean Guisan, son of a medical doctor and nephew of the famous Swiss general Guisan, started the production of hypodermic needles in the cellar of a building on Avenue de Cour, Lausanne, Switzerland. After a while, he found more appropriate production facilities on Rue de Gen√®ve, Lausanne. The newly founded company was named P.-J. Guisan S.A. and produced hypodermic needles for dentists and medical doctors.from the book H. Rieben et al., \\"Portraits de 250 entreprises vaudoises\\", 1980, p.136-137, At that time, the tubes used for the production of the needles were imported but during World War II, the supply became complicated and Mr. Guisan contacted a French company in order to eventually obtain, in 1944, the stainless steel tube drawing process knowhow required for the production of needles. At the same time, the company Wander S.A. became interested in purchasing and increasing the export sales of Swiss companies active in the medical field. They showed interest in both P.-J. Guisan S.A and a syringe- producing company, while helping Mr.Guisan in his efforts to produce stainless steel tubes. The company Wander S.A.Abstract from the book \\"Portraits de 250 entreprises vaudoises\\" keyword Wander acquired 50% of the shares of P.-J. Guisan S.A. and Microtube S.A., also founded by Mr.Guisan in 1944 for the stainless steel tube drawing activity. In 1946, Mr.K√ºnzli, in charge of the medical department from Wander S.A. founded a company named Intramed S.A.Abstract from the book \\"Portraits de 250 entreprises vaudoises\\" keyword Intramed in Bern, and acquired all the shares previously acquired by Wander S.A. Unfortunately, the results were not up to the ambitions of Mr.K√ºnzli and in 1950, the company went out of business. At that time, a business company in Lausanne, Socorex S.A., was interested in purchasing shares in the medical industry, Therefore, it bought the trademarks, the activity and half of the shares of P.-J. Guisan S.A.. The other half, held by Mr.Guisan himself, was acquired at the same time. Socorex also took out the options on the shares from Microtube and the syringe-producing company Isba Instruments Scientifiques S.A., in Bassecourt. As Socorex took on the activity of Intramed, the focus was on needles and syringes. The production of the other products were gradually abandoned, as the syringes and needles from Socorex Abstract from the book \\"Portraits de 250 entreprises vaudoises\\" keyword Socorex gained worldwide reputation. In 1954, the owners of Socorex S.A. decided to sell this activity to a new company named Socorex Instruments Medicaux S.A., led by Mr.Hertig and Mr. Karl Schoenholzer, who was an authorized representative from Socorex. This company took on the activity of Socorex S.A. in the same facilities, and focused even more on needles and syringes. At that time, about 70-80% of the syringes and needles produced in Switzerland by the company were sold for export. In 1958, Mr. Hertig and Mr. Schoenholzer decided to split up. It was decided that Mr. Hertig, owner of the syringe production activity, would keep the syringe field from Socorex Instruments M√©dicaux S.A., which later would become Socorex-Isba S.A. Mr. Karl Schoenholzer took on the production and the sale for export of the needles under a new company name, Unimed S.A.Abstract from the book \\"Portraits de 250 entreprises vaudoises\\" keyword Unimed Unimed S.A. headquarters in Lausanne Medical devices produced by Unimed S.A.  History  Unimed focused even more on the field of medical needles and developed the production of surgical needles that had been started in 1951 by Socorex S.A.. Additionally, the sales program of the medical needles was developed and the field of veterinary needles was added to the production. The needles that were produced according to several models and dimensions, were sold by authorized retailers in Switzerland and abroad. In 1981, Mr. Patrick Schoenholzer, son of Mr. Karl Schoenholzer, a graduate engineer from ETH Lausanne was hired by the company. At the time the increasing cost of cleaning and reconditioning of reusable needles as well as fears about the emerging AIDS virus, led to a rapid decline of sales of standard Unimed brand products. It was therefore decided to reorient the company's activity to contract manufacturing by making available its knowhow in the stainless steel tube forming process. Contract manufacturing as well as the supply of stainless steel tubing positioned Unimed as a key supplier to the medical device and diagnostics industries.Article from the monthly industry magazine MSM for the Swiss mechanical industry association (GIM-ch) Currently Unimed serves more than 1,500 clients in 70 countries. Contract manufacturing has become a major business for the company, which is producing a large number of finished and semi-finished products for its clients who eventually place them on the market under their own brand name.

Crace has stated that Harvest would be his final novel. Harvest was shortlisted for the 2013 Man Booker Prize, shortlisted for the inaugural Goldsmiths Prize, shortlisted for the Walter Scott Prize (2014), and won the 2013 James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the International Dublin Literary Award in 2015. In 2019, Harvest was ranked 81st on The Guardian's list of the 100 best books of the 21st century. Plot summary Harvest tells the story of a remote English village as economic progress disrupts pastoral idyll following the Enclosure Act. The protagonist, Walter Thirsk, tells the story from his perspective, but in fact is rarely present when the events of the novel take place due to his injury that he sustains at the beginning of the novel. The story begins with the arrival of some strangers to the bounds of the village. Following the burning of the stables, a scapegoat is required as no-one wants to admit that one of their own was responsible. Hence a mob sets out in order to find evidence to blame these new arrivals. After a brief altercation with the three strangers, they are arrested by Master Kent and chained to the pillory for the week. The woman travelling with them is shaved of her hair, and expected to be submissive to the men of the village. At their annual festival, a crippled chart maker that Master Kent has hired to map out the village, Phillip Earle (or Mr. Quill as the villagers call him) selects the young Lizzie Carr to be the Gleaning Queen of the festival. The festivities are interrupted by the shaven woman, earning her the nickname \\"Mistress Beldam\\" who goes to hide in the woods. Walter's injury makes him unable to work the field so ends up showing Mr. Quill around. He takes a liking to the man and often imagines returning to urban life under Mr. Quill's employ. When they return to the manor they find that the elderly stranger has died in the pillory. Master Kent's cousin, Edmund Jordan, realises that he has a claim on the land and arrives, intending to change the way of life of the village by building a church, fencing off the area and focusing on shepherding sheep to increase his profits despite the fact the villagers depend upon the leftovers from the harvest to feed themselves. Walter is distressed to find Master Kent seems quite reserved and submissive to Jordan's plans but Mr. Quill is more critical and skeptical, sympathising with the villagers. The night after Jordan and his entourage arrive Master Kent's horse, Willowjack, is murdered. Jordan organises a search of every home in the village and states that the villager found responsible will be hung for their crimes. They eventually find a bloody shawl belonging to the outsider woman but Master Kent claims it belonged to his deceased wife to spare Mistress Beldam from being hunted and fabricates a story about a travelling ruffian stealing it and causing mischief around the village. Several of the villagers tell Jordan's men that the true culprit is Mistress Beldam who they suspect of being a witch. That night, Mr. Quill befriends the young stranger still in the pillory who is Mistress Beldam's husband. He learns they had to leave their town when it too began focusing on shepherding sheep and no longer had enough food and shelter for all the villagers. Mr. Quill and Walter wait by the pillory in the dark and when Mistress Beldam arrives to bring her husband food and water, Mr. Quill pursues her into the night. Lizzie Carr, Anne Rogers and Kitty Gosse are apprehended by Jordan's men, beaten and interrogated, being forced to confess to being followers of witchcraft. When pressured to say who their leader is, they naturally name an outsider, Mr. Quill. Lizzie Carr's family attacks Edmund Jordan's groom when he taunts them with a claim that their young daughter will be burnt alive, in the ensuing scuffle someone draws a blade and disfigures his face. Fearing retribution for attacking one of Jordan's men, all the villagers pack up and flee their homes, leaving only Walter behind. The next day Walter is called to the manor for breakfast. With the villagers gone, Edmund Jordan has forgotten all about his accusations of witchcraft and sorcery; the intent was always to rile up the villagers until they left so he could start over. Master Kent later tells Walter that he was able to use his cousin's good mood to negotiate the freedom of the three captured women but in exchange Walter would remain behind to be Jordan's eyes and ears. Walter is left with orders to release Mistress Beldam's husband from the pillory only when his sentence is carried out and then watches alone from atop a hill as Masters Jordan and Kent ride away followed by Jordan's men and the three women. Walter releases Mistress Beldam's husband from the pillory early in exchange for him helping him plough and sow seeds in the fields as a final act of revenge against Jordan. Realising that his revenge is timid and petty, Walter spends the night getting drunk on ale and eating fairy cap mushrooms he finds in the forest. The next day he comes to his senses in the manor courtyard and realising last night either he or someone else packed his bags for him. He enters the manor, realising that Mistress Beldam and her husband reunited and spent the night sleeping there and have thoroughly wrecked everything in the manor. Moving up to the attic, he looks out and sees the Beldams. Anything they didn't destroy in the manor they've stolen and loaded into a cart with some stolen oxen. The husband takes and axe to the pillory, destroying it whilst Mistress Beldam goes around the village setting fire to all the houses. Afraid they will set fire to the manor not knowing he's inside, Walter hurries to leave only to notice blood near a chest in the attic, looking it over he finds Mr. Quill's body. His friend has been stabbed to death but whether by Mistress Beldam or Edmund Jordan's men, Walter can't tell and admits he will never know. Heading outside he finds that the Beldams are leaving without having set fire to the manor and so takes it upon himself to finalise their revenge and his own by burning down the manor and cremating Mr. Quill with it. Walter burns Mr. Quill's maps, the one detailing what the village looked like before the week that ruined it and the one that he made for Jordan's vision of what it should become. Walter keeps only for himself a blank sheet of vellum he made for Mr. Quill, his packed bags and his injuries as he leaves the abandoned and ruined village, seeking out new pastures.

On 29 April 1880, Sandgate was proclaimed a municipality known as the Borough of Sandgate. The Local Authorities Act 1902 replaced all Divisions and Boroughs with Towns and Shires, creating the Town of Sandgate on 31 March 1903. On 1 October 1925, it was amalgamated into the City of Brisbane. From its first settlement Sandgate relied on inadequate water supplies from tanks and the local lagoons. Many investigations into better water supplies were carried out over the years, but it was not until November, 1921, that Sandgate was connected to the Brisbane water supply system. At the official opening, the Minister for Works, Mr. W. Forgan Smith, described this as \\"a historic occasion.\\" Sandgate Town Hall The original Sandgate Town Hall, Brisbane, 1901 The original Sandgate Town Hall was designed by Richard Gailey and built in 1882 at Kate Street, Shorncliffe but burned down on 24 May 1910. Its replacement was built in 1911‚Äì1912 at 5 Brighton Street, Sandgate to be closer to the Sandgate railway station and the Sandgate Post Office. After the amalgamation into City of Brisbane, the Sandgate Town Hall was used as a library, School of Arts and a health clinic. Today it is used as meeting rooms available for use by community groups. The Sandgate Town Hall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 2005.

It was designed by Thomas Ramsay Hall and built from 1911 to 1912 by John Gemmell. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995.  History  The Sandgate Town Hall was constructed in 1911-1912 when the previous chambers were destroyed by fire on 24 May 1910. The architect of the hall, which cost ¬£5000, was Thomas Ramsay Hall, and the contractor John Gemmell. Europeans first settled in Sandgate in the 1850s, and the area prospered into the following century as the principal sea-side resort in south east Queensland, encouraged by the introduction of the railway in May 1882. The Town of Sandgate was established in 1902, previously included as part of the Nundah Division from 1879, then established as a separate Borough of Sandgate in April 1880. Clock tower facing Seymour Street, Sandgate The first Municipal Council meetings from 1880 until 1882 were held in a large room rented in a masonry building, thought to be the oldest building in Sandgate. The first official Sandgate Municipal Chambers and Town Hall was designed by Richard Gailey in 1882, and built in Kate Street near the popular pier and bathing area in what is now Shorncliffe. However, as Sandgate progressed, the centre of development was nearer the Sandgate railway station in Rainbow Street. Therefore, when a fire in 1910 destroyed the chambers a site for the new Town Hall was chosen closer to the Sandgate railway station and the 1887 Sandgate Post Office. The foundation stone for the Sandgate Town Hall was laid by Sir William MacGregor, Governor of Queensland, on 14 October 1911. The building was constructed by John Gemmell, in eleven months, at a cost of ¬£5000 including ¬£300 for furnishing. Thomas Ramsay Hall, the architect, was then the Town Clerk of Sandgate. Later in his career, Hall went into partnership with George Gray Prentice (1919‚Äì1929) and designed such buildings as the Brisbane City Hall and from 1929‚Äì1948, he was in partnership with Lionel Blythewood Phillips with whom he designed many buildings, including Ascot Chambers and the McWhirters corner block. Architectural drawing, 1919 The Sandgate Town Hall was designed to sit on a prominent corner, and was therefore an L-shaped building with wings extending along both streets; the hall in the Brighton Road wing was accessed from the principal corner entrance and Council Chambers and various offices were accessed from a centrally located entrance on Seymour Street. The rear elevation featured a balcony opening from both the hall and the offices. The clock tower climbed three levels from the cloak room near the principal corner entrance, with room allocated for the clock on the second level and a bell on the third. The Town Hall was opened on 21 September 1912 by the Queensland Governor, William MacGregor, at a ceremony attended by 500 people. A four dial clock, acquired from the Old Ipswich Town Hall by a Brisbane watchmaker, Frederick John Bright, was installed in the clocktower in 1923. The clock is reputedly one of the oldest working clocks in Brisbane, built by Gillet and Johnstone of Croydon, England in 1877. In 1925, under the requirements of the City of Brisbane Act of 1924, the Town of Sandgate merged with 19 other local government areas to form the Greater Brisbane, and the Sandgate Town Hall was retained by the new Brisbane City Council for use as a community hall, variously acting as the library for the school of arts and a health clinic. The main hall is currently used for public meetings and other community gatherings the council library operates from the former Council Chambers and offices which were altered for this purpose.  Description  Sandgate Town Hall is a single-storeyed masonry building with a partial basement floor. The building has a gabled corrugated-iron roof and features a face-brick plinth and rough-cast stuccoed facade. It is L-shaped in plan with a prominent clock tower near the intersection of the two wings. The stuccoed tower has face brick corner pilasters and decorative mouldings. A bellcast roof sheeted with decorative pressed metal conceals the three bells and is surmounted by a weathervane. The town hall has square-arched openings to the Brighton Street wing and round arched openings to the other. The principal entrance, at the corner of the site is defined by two massive Ionic columns, behind which a recessed entrance porch is located. The entrance to the library, on Seymour Street, is emphasised by a decorative parapeted section featuring Art Nouveau signage \\"SANDGATE TOWN COUNCIL AD 1911\\" and a large round arched opening with floral leadlight window. Other decorative elements include face-brick quoining, Art Nouveau signage, roughcast stucco render in some sections, and dormer windows. Hall and stage viewed from the dress circle, 2011 Internally the building features a large hall and stage, a library chamber and various administrative offices. The hall has a mezzanine dress circle level, with early timber and iron row seating. The ceiling of the hall and the proscenium arch are sheeted with decorative pressed metal. The clock tower is accessed in the vestibule at the rear of the dress circle by a fixed timber ladder leading to three levels containing various clock workings, weights and bells. The library features four different patterns of pressed metal on the ceiling, which indicate the original layout of the space. An early half-glazed door in the library has an embossed pattern, featuring lettering \\"THE MAYOR\\" in stylised Art Nouveau lettering.  Heritage listing  Sandgate Town Hall was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 January 1995 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Sandgate Town Hall provides evidence of the Town of Sandgate in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

It is an intact example of the civic work of renowned Brisbane architect, Thomas Ramsay Hall. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building is a landmark on a prominent site in Sandgate, of particular note for its unusual clocktower, and as an integral element of the precinct including the Post Office and Sandgate War Memorial Park. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building has a long association with the local community as a focal point for social and community functions.

It was designed by Montague Talbot Stanley and built from 1919 to 1920. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 April 2005.  History  The Hamilton Town Hall, a single- storey brick building comprising council chambers and public hall, was erected in 1920 for the Hamilton Town Council. It was designed by Montague Talbot Stanley, and is one eight remaining town halls from the twenty that were built prior to the formation of Greater Brisbane in 1925. When Moreton Bay was opened for free settlement in 1842, local government was controlled from Sydney, using British Imperial Government policy. The Municipality of Brisbane was not proclaimed until 1859, and the first council was elected in the same year. As settlements sprang up around Brisbane a desire for separate municipality status developed, and in 1879 the Divisional Boards Act provided for a number of new autonomous authorities adjacent to Brisbane. By 1891, 21 local authorities had been created in the Brisbane metropolitan area under this legislation. These consisted of the City of Brisbane as well as a municipality, shires, divisions, and one borough. In 1890, the Hamilton Division separated from Toombul Division, although the Hamilton Divisional Board initially conducted its business from the Toombul Divisional Board Offices. Andrew Petrie was appointed the first chairman. The board became a Town Council in 1904 and the first mayor was John Brett Charlton. In 1917 the council purchased (approximately 1600 square metres) of land in Racecourse Road with the intention of building council chambers and a public hall. In 1919 plans and specifications for the new building were received from Montague Stanley, son of Francis Drummond Greville Stanley, the well-known Queensland Colonial Architect. At a special meeting, amendments were made, including a wider front door and the use of Australian manufactured materials. A tender from Messrs McArthur & Walker for was accepted and the current mayor Alderman George Rees laid the foundation stone on 26 September 1919. Extra walling and iron railing with a double gate along Racecourse Road was added to the plan and the building was completed in 1920 for a cost of . The town hall accommodated council officers as well as providing council chambers and a public hall. There were a kitchen and a strong room, but it is not known if the supper room was constructed at this time. An honour board for local residents who had contributed to World War I was erected in the council offices. With rapid population increases, small local governments found it ever more difficult to fund and administer their responsibilities effectively and economically. The development of services such as roads, transport, water supply and sewerage could only be efficiently managed by an overarching authority. A move to amalgamate local authorities began in 1902 when the Booroodabin Division was absorbed into the City of Brisbane. The idea of amalgamation was promoted throughout the 1900s and culminated in the City of Brisbane Act of 1924, when Hamilton was one of the towns and shires who joined to form the Brisbane City Council. The first Greater Brisbane Council was elected on 21 February 1925 and the Hamilton Town Council was disbanded. The Hamilton Town Hall then became the property of the Brisbane City Council and since that time has had various uses. During 1925/1926 it is recorded as a council depot in the Post Office directories. From 1927 it was known as the School of Arts and provided a venue for social events. The building was headquarters for the Australian Army Survey Corps during World War Two. After the war, major alterations were made to the council chambers to create the Hamilton Municipal Library. The hall continued to be used for various social activities. Additions were made to the northern end of the hall in 1973 to accommodate the mobile library service. Further changes in 1987 included alterations to the dressing room and a covered walkway between the Supper Room and the hall. The former town hall still houses the city council's Hamilton library and it is used by an amateur theatrical group and by other local groups for meetings and social activities. Though its use as a venue for functions and gatherings and as a local library, the building has long associations with the cultural and social life of the area.  Description  The former Hamilton Town Hall is on a corner block, with the entrance to the library from Racecourse Road and the entrance to the hall from Rossiter Parade. It consists of a series of linked single-storey structures comprising the original brick main building (hall and library), a timber supper room, and the 1973 brick annexe. The main building is a load-bearing face brick structure with a timber-framed floor and a timber-framed terracotta tiled roof. Externally the building features English-bond face brickwork contrasted by a rendered base, string courses and entablature. Both street elevations are emphasized by a pedimented frontispiece. The original balustraded parapet is now missing, as are the metal palisades and gates to both street alignments. = Library (formerly council chambers) = Stained glass at entry, 2013 Library at Hamilton Town Hall, 2013 The entrance to the library consists of a vestibule with Art Nouveau-styled leaded glass windows and tessellated/encaustic floor tiles. Some floor tiles are replicas laid down in 2004. Only a small section of the border pattern consists of the original tiles, the others being specially made replicas laid in 2004. Panels in the French doors opening into the library and sections on either side of the doors are all matching leadlight. Internally, the Library has been substantially altered by the removal of walls and doorways. However, the \\"Reliance\\" strongroom with steel doors remains in working order. The main windows to both street facades are original Diocletian windows and sashes. The interior features shallow coffered ceilings with plaster rose. Picture rails remain in some rooms, and the section of the library with the strongroom is half paneled.

It revolves around a story of Kemi (Damilola Adegbite) who wants to marry Umar (Chris Attoh); a young man who is desperate to get ahead in his career. When their relationship hits troubled waters, Kemi seeks the help of movie superstar Tunde (Blossom Chukwujekwu) and they hatch a plan to get Kemi what she wants. Flower Girl official UK film poster Plot Kemi works in her parents‚Äô flower shop, and she dreams of becoming one of the happy married couples she sees every day. Her longtime lawyer boyfriend Umar has promised to marry her when he gets a promotion, but she is growing impatient. Still living with her embarrassing parents, she spends her nights in her room, planning the wedding she hopes to have someday. Then comes the day that she has been waiting for; Umar has got the promotion! However, when she arrives expecting a big proposal, he breaks up with her instead. Devastated, she goes on a delivery, and, unable to see where she is going through tears of grief, she gets hit by a car. The driver turns out to be Tunde Kulani, the famous Nollywood movie star. While Tunde tends to her wounds, Kemi breaks down and tells him about her dilemma. Tunde offers to help her get Umar to propose. They devise a plan. They will pretend to be a couple to make Umar jealous and get him back proposing on his knees. Cast As with Small Boy, Bello brought new faces to the secondary roles and decided to mix the main cast with up-and- coming young actors. For most of them, including TV star Damilola Adegbite, it was their first time acting in a Nigerian feature film. Another new experience was having them getting used to the director‚Äôs unique style and techniques during their weeks of rehearsal. =Main Cast= * Damilola Adegbite as Kemi Williams, a young romantic florist who works for her parents while constantly dreaming of her perfect wedding day. * Chris Attoh as Umar Abubakar, Kemi‚Äôs long-time boyfriend. He's an ambitious young lawyer, anxious to rapidly climb the ladder in the law firm where he works. * Blossom Chukwujekwu as Tunde Kulani, the hot Nollywood film star. The decision to cast Chukwujekwu in this role was unanimous. Chukwujekwu said that he was attracted to the movie's message and how it was written. * Eku Edewor as Sapphire, Tunde‚Äôs on-and-off sexy, vixen girlfriend who blackmails Tunde without any hesitation. * Bikiya Graham-Douglas as Stella, Kemi‚Äôs quirky, outrageous best friend. Says Graham- Douglas, \\"Stella is energetic, flamboyant, unapologetic, full of life and she‚Äôs very caring....\\". Says Bello, \\"Graham-Douglas was a ball of energy on set\\". =Supporting Cast= *Patrick Doyle as Kemi‚Äôs eccentric father, Mr. Williams. *Teni Aofeyebi as Mrs. Ada, the queen of the tabloid industry. *Tosan Edremoda-Ugbeye as Funke Williams, Kemi‚Äôs sweet, loving mother. *Ahide Adum as Tunde‚Äôs wealthy father and agent, Sule Kulani. *Grace Agu as Taiwo, a snooty sales assistant *Angela Adiele as Morenike, the second snobbish sales assistant *Jude Orhorha as Mr. Odo, Umar‚Äôs boss in the law firm Production Michelle Bello developed the initial rough script for the film while studying for her master's degree in Communications at Regent University in Virginia, United States. The class was asked to write a full-length feature film script, which she had never done before. She gave a lot of thought to the story she would want to write about; one that would be exciting enough to develop into a ninety-page script. She says; \\"I loved watching romantic comedy. I‚Äôve always been a romantic at heart and I could often relate to the main characters and their experiences. I really wanted to take this genre and adapt it to a modern day movie set in Lagos, Nigeria. I wanted to explore a whole range of colorful characters - both their good sides and their bad sides because at the end of the day no one is perfect.\\" Bello wrote the first draft of Flower Girl, which was originally called Caught Up, in the short period of two months. She added issues occurring in relationships of young couples today in Nigerian society making it relatable for the young audiences. \\"I remember my screenwriting professor really liked the first draft of the script because he gave me an A, so I was really happy. Back then, I never really thought of it as my second feature film. It was only when trying to come up with some ideas with my brother who wrote the final script that I realized that this script would be great to shoot back home as it had an international theme and crossover appeal,\\" says Bello. Screenwriter Jigi Bello says, Flower Girl was a unique opportunity to create a cinematic world that would appeal to audiences in his country. He says As a Nigerian, it was exciting to explore the characters in the new quickly emerging middle class. It starts with a real group of characters you would meet on a Lagos street: the romantic, the playboy, the business man, the mentor, and through a twist of fate allow them to discover each other. \\"The fun for me as a writer and where the comedy comes from is the honesty of these characters to their own beliefs, no matter how crazy the situation. I hope others enjoy the story as much as I did,\\" adds Bello. Co- Producer Michelle Dede says, Producing a film, especially in Nigeria, is not the easiest thing to do. It was very rewarding because of the experience of being on a film set and all the little things that go into making a movie possible. Music Music was composed by Hitplay. Several additional songs include: * \\"Ma Se Yen\\" - performed by Lesoul * \\"Falling for You\\" - performed by Kaline * \\"Fine Lady\\" - performed by Lynxxx * \\"Best In Me\\" - performed by Efya Release The world premiere of Flower Girl took place on 13 February 2013 in Lagos, Nigeria. It went on general release in Nigeria on Valentine‚Äôs Day 2013 and received mixed critical reviews. The film was the number one box office hit that weekend in Lagos. The Ghana premiere subsequently took place on 5 May 2013 in Accra and on the first night had to be shown in an additional cinema hall due to the large number of people there who had anxiously awaited the arrival of the movie in their country. The UK premiere was held on 26 September 2013 at the Odeon Cinema in Greenwich. Talking Drum Entertainment UK distributed a new edited version of the romantic comedy on Friday, 4 October 2013 in selected Odeon, Vue, Cineworld and independent cinemas.Flower Girl Flower Girl was also screened at the Hollywood Black Film Festival 2013 and had its US premiere at the festival screening in Los Angeles on 3 October 2013.

Opened in its current form in 2002, it is a recreation area and Green corridor that takes in a town park, Greenfields Nature Reserve, Staggs Brook and the Whitchurch Arm of the Llangollen Canal. The area is maintained by Whitchurch Town Council and owned by Whitchurch Waterway Trust. There are plans to extend the canal within the country park and create a basin for Narrowboat moorings.  History and location  The country park was created as part of Whitchurch Renewal Area Scheme and developed from a project initiated in the 1980s by North Shropshire District Council and the town council to bring a defunct canal back into Whitchurch as a tourist attraction. Originally a branch of the Llangollen Canal, the canal had opened in 1811 and was formally closed in 1944. Early work to secure the future of the site included the purchase of land in the Sherrymill Hill area of the town to preserve it from future development and the creation of the Whitchurch Waterway Trust to lead the project. The country park formally opened in 2002. It is located to the west of Whitchurch, close to the A41. The area includes Greeenfields Nature Reserve ‚Äì managed by Shropshire Wildlife Trust ‚Äì Staggs Brook, the town's Jubilee Park and the Whitchurch Arm of the canal. = Wildlife and natural features = The presence of water and unimproved grassland and patches of semi-natural woodland, particularly around Greenfields Nature Reserve, has created a habitat that includes Cuckoo flower and water voles, as well as many butterfly species. The area around Staggs Brook is now managed to maintain it as a suitable habitat for the water voles, which are a protected species in the UK. = Potential future developments = In February 2012, Whitchurch Waterway Trust unveiled plans to extend the canal under Chemistry Bridge and create a new basin with moorings on part of the country park. The proposed scheme would cost an estimated ¬£475,000 and enable canal boats to moor closer to the centre of Whitchurch. The proposal is still being assessed for flood risk and impact on biodiversity after queries were raised by both the Environment Agency and the Canal and River Trust.

Background Prior to her speech, Gillard had received backlash from the Australian Media and members of the official Opposition Party that targeted her gender. Bill Heffernan said she ‚Äúwas unfit for leadership because she was deliberately barren\\". Her personal life also faced scrutiny, particularly as she was unmarried and childless. Former Liberal party politician, Sophie Mirabella, said ‚Äú You won't need his [ex-PM Kevin Rudd's] taxpayer-funded nanny, will you?‚Äù regarding her ousting of the previous Prime Minister. Additionally, a Coalition fundraiser included a satirical menu with a dish described as ‚ÄúJulia Gillard Kentucky Fried Quail - Small Breasts, Huge Thighs & a Big Red Box.‚Äù Gillard also faced criticism for her actions as leader, reportedly being ‚Äúcharacterized as unseemly and unduly brutal for a woman‚Äù. There were also several instances of ‚Äúhateful attacks from anonymous critics, as a plethora of pornographic and degrading images of the prime minister circulated on web sites, e-mail, and social media‚Äù The Opposition Leader at the time, Tony Abbott, had risen in parliament with a motion to have Peter Slipper removed as Speaker over crude and sexist texts Slipper had sent to an aide. Abbott stated that every day Gillard supported Slipper was \\"another day of shame for a government which should already have died of shame\\".Stephanie Gardiner, (10 October 2012), 'Died of shame': focus on Abbott's use of controversial phrase, Sydney Morning Herald, Accessed 21 July 2016 Gillard made statements in support of Slipper and linked Abbott's motion to remarks made by Alan Jones in the then-recent Alan Jones shame controversy. Gillard said that \\"every day in every way\\" Abbott was sexist and misogynist. Within the speech, Gillard noted a number of statements Abbott had previously made. In an interview Abbott had stated, \\"If it's true, Stavros [the interviewer], that men have more power generally speaking than women, is that a bad thing?\\" When another person present at this interview stated they wanted their daughter to have as much opportunity as their son, Abbott responded, \\"Yeah, I completely agree, but what if men are by physiology or temperament, more adapted to exercise authority or to issue command?\\" Gillard also said that in March 2004, Abbott stated, \\"Abortion is the easy way out\\" and that he had stood next to a sign \\"ditch the witch\\" in reference to her political role. Reactions The speech was criticised by some Australian journalists but attracted widespread interest and positive attention in feminist blogs and social media. Expat Chloe Angyal wrote for Britain's The Guardian that the speech tackled \\"sexism head-on\\" and was a \\"masterful, righteous take-down\\" and similar opinions were expressed by other expatriate Australian journalists. Britain's Daily Telegraph women's editor said that Gillard had cleverly shifted the focus of the news story with \\"an impressive set of insults\\". Within a week, a YouTube version of the speech had one million views. the ABC news video has 3.4 million views. The context of the Labor Party's support for Peter Slipper, however, meant that commentary from domestic journalists was far more critical, with Michelle Grattan writing \\"it sounded more desperate than convincing\\", Peter Hartcher that Gillard \\"chose to defend the indefensible\\" and Peter van Onselen that the government had \\"egg on their collective faces\\". The public reaction was also polarised: approval ratings of Gillard and Abbott both improved following the speech. Gillard told media that she had been approached by world leaders who congratulated her on the speech at the 2012 Asia-Europe Meeting, including French President Fran√ßois Hollande and Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt. Gillard told press that United States President Barack Obama had also raised her speech when she phoned to congratulate him for his victory in the 2012 United States election. Two years after the speech, Hillary Clinton said that Gillard had \\"faced outrageous sexism\\", and that she found the speech very striking. =Abbott's response= Abbott discussed the speech with Annabel Crabb on her TV show Kitchen Cabinet in September 2013 ahead of the 2013 federal election, saying, \\"it was a very unfair speech, I thought, and it was a completely invalid speech in terms of responding to the issue of that day; it was just an invalid thing to say. But look, politics is about theatre and at the time I didn't think it was very effective theatre at all. But plainly it did strike a chord in a lot of people who had not followed the immediate problem that had brought on that particular parliamentary debate.\\" = Gillard's remarks = Gillard explained the speech to The Guardian's Gabrielle Chan remarking \\"I thought after everything I have experienced, I have to listen to Tony Abbott lecture me about sexism.\\" and that it was this \\"That gave me the emotional start to the speech and once I started, it took on a life of its own.\\" Additionally she felt she was receiving \\"the burden but none of the benefits\\" as being the first female Prime Minister of Australia. =Perceptions of hypocrisy= Gillard's speech was criticised as hypocritical by some because earlier in the day the Labor Party had passed legislation cutting welfare benefits to single parents, almost all of whom were single mothers. In Overland, Stephanie Convery wrote: \\"Standing up for women's rights is not just about calling sexism for what it is. It's about agitating for specific change... I don't care how many sharp speeches she makes: her government is making life for some of the most vulnerable women in Australia even harder than it already is, and I want no part in it.\\" In Crikey, Shakira Hussein wrote \\"I will not be lectured on sexism or misogyny by Julia Gillard on the very day that she has driven so many women deeper into poverty.\\" Many single mothers interviewed by Anwen Crawford for Meanjin were similarly critical of the speech's timing. Results of the speech After Gillard's speech went viral, the Macquarie Dictionary updated its definition of the term \\"misogyny\\". Previously defined as a \\"hatred of women\\" by the Australian dictionary, misogyny now encompasses \\"entrenched prejudice against women\\". Director of the Australian National Dictionary Centre in Canberra, Amanda Laugesen, said the broader definition has a long history, with the original Oxford English Dictionary defining misogyny as \\"hatred or dislike or prejudice against women\\" and including examples dating back to the 19th century. Australia-born Cornell University philosopher Kate Manne uses Gillard's speech as a central, clarifying example in her 2017 book Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny. In the book, she writes that Gillard's use of the word \\"misogyny\\" is the use that has been common among feminists for years. The example of Gillard's speech serves to clarify that misogyny and sexism are distinct concepts, designating two branches of patriarchy: sexism serves to rationalize and justify the patriarchal order, while misogyny polices and enforces patriarchal order, according to Manne. In a 2019 Forbes article, Gillard said when talking about the reaction to the speech that she felt \\"that speech helps deal with those frustrations and unlock a little sense of power. It is possible to stand up and name and shame sexism and misogyny,‚Äù and that women the speech reached felt connected to it because it is similar to how they would wish to respond. The speech was voted by Guardian readers in 2020 as the number one most unforgettable moment in Australian TV history. Gillard has expressed belief that the speech overshadowed other work in her political career: \\"I'm reconciled with it now and I understand that when people are writing things about me ‚Äì including writing my obituary, hopefully in many years to come ‚Äì that it‚Äôs going to feature in there.\\" References External links =Transcript and video=  * =Selected further media coverage=   Category:Gillard Government Category:2012 in Australia Category:2012 in politics Category:2012 in women's history Category:2012 speeches Category:October 2012 events in Australia Category:Sexism in Australia Category:Works about misogyny Category:Viral videos ","title":"Misogyny Speech"},{"id":"40247986","title":"Nordfriesland ‚Äì Dithmarschen Nord"},{"id":"40248005","text":"Peter the Younger (Romanian: Petru cel T√¢nƒÉr) (1547 ‚Äì 19 August 1569) was the Voivode (Prince) of Wallachia between 25 September 1559 and 8 June 1568.GIURESCU, C.C. ‚Äì Istoria rom√¢nilor, vol.

On 24 October 1559, Peter, who was still a minor was confirmed by the Sublime Porte as the new ruler of Wallachia. Peter was totally different from his father, having a mild and religious nature. Because he was too young, the country was led by his capable mother Lady Chiajna, who was able to neutralize the intrigues of the pretenders to the throne and the manoeuvres of King of Hungary.  Death  Attempting to secure the wealth of both the family and the state, the Ottoman Empire, through a representative, managed to send the young prince in exile along with his mother, Lady Chiajna in 1568. Peter the Younger arrived in Constantinople on 31 May and was taken to the Seven Towers fortress, where he was stripped of his riches. On 19 August 1569, Peter the Younger died of poisoning in Konya in Asia Minor, he was only 21 years old. He was buried in the Church of the Transfiguration in the same locality. Legacy Peter established the Plumbuita Monastery in 1560 and continued his father's work on restoring the Curtea Veche church and the Snagov Monastery.

Redware as a single word is a term for at least two types of pottery of the last few centuries, in Europe and North America. Red ware as two words is a term used for pottery, mostly by archaeologists, found in a very wide range of places. However, these distinct usages are not always adhered to, especially when referring to the many different types of pre-colonial red wares in the Americas, which may be called \\"redware\\". In the great majority of cases the \\"red\\" concerned is the natural reddish-brown of the fired clay, and the same sort of colour as in terracotta (which most types of red ware could also be called) or red brick. The colour to which clay turns when fired varies considerably with its geological makeup and the conditions of firing, and as well as terracotta red, covers a wide range of blacks, browns, greys, whites and yellows. Of the two \\"redware\\" types, both made in the 17th to 19th centuries (with modern revivals or imitations), the European was unglazed stoneware, mostly for teapots, jugs and mugs, and moderately, sometimes very, expensive. The American redware was cheap earthenware, very often with a ceramic glaze, used for a wide variety of kitchen and dining functions, as well as objects such as chamberpots.Turnbaugh, 223 Redware Covered Sugar Bowl, Wedgwood, 1805-1815, in Rosso Antico ware with fashionable \\"Neo- Egyptian\\" decoration =European= In European contexts \\"redware\\" usually means an unglazed (\\"dry-bodied\\") stoneware, typically used for serving or drinking drinks. The term is especially used for pottery from the 17th and 18th centuries, before porcelain, whether imported from East Asia or made in Europe, became cheap enough to be used very widely. In this period red stoneware was used for vessels, especially teapots, jugs and mugs, which were relatively expensive and carefully made and decorated. Imported examples of Chinese Yixing clay teapots, an unglazed stoneware type made from a special type of clay, provided the exemplars and were often copied with various degrees of closeness. Soon a European design vocabulary was used as well. A Delftware manufacturer announced in 1678 that he was making \\"red teapots\\", of which no examples are known to survive. The Dutch Elers brothers brought the style to Staffordshire pottery in the 1690s, after finding a suitable source of clay, and were widely imitated there. Some red stoneware by rival Dutch potters including Arij de Milde from the years around 1700 does survive, closely copying Yixing pots in style. Johann Friedrich B√∂ttger was in contact with some of these and developed a rival \\"B√∂ttger ware\\", a dark red stoneware first sold in 1710, and manufactured and imitated by others, all up to about 1740.Osborne, 134 It was B√∂ttger's first commercial ware and a significant stage in his development of porcelain in Europe, which he was soon making at the Meissen porcelain factory.The Discovery Of European Porcelain By Bottger - A Systematic Creative Development.

Mields. Sprechsaal 115, (1), 64, 1982 Josiah Wedgwood later refined the type, and gave the decoration a fashionable turn towards Neoclassicism, with his \\"Rosso Antico\\" body. This was usually decorated with sprigged reliefs in black, creating pleasing contrasts like those in his earlier Jasperware. =American= American redware slip-decorated dish, around 1800 In American contexts \\"redware\\" usually means earthenware with a reddish body, whether glazed or not. In fact it was very often given a white or other glaze, either tin-glazed or lead-glazed, though it is more usual to describe them as lead-glazed. Depending on the locality, this was the basic utilitarian pottery of the Colonial period of North America. It was often complemented by imported or American stoneware for large vessels where the added strength was useful. The name distinguishes the type from various other earthenwares with white, grey or yellow colours to the fired body, depending on the particular clay used. Some redware was imported from England. Later, American stoneware in particular, and various types of modern wares, including porcelain, took over for many types of objects.Groover, 231-233; Turnbaugh Major museum collections concentrate on the larger dishes, platters and jugs that are glazed, often in yellowish tones, and painted with bold folk art designs, even well into the 19th century. But these special decorated pieces are rather untypical of the mass of sherds found by archaeologists excavating sites of the period. Many of these fancy pieces are dated, signed or marked with a stamp. File:Tea Canister MET DP207182 (cropped).jpgTea caddy, with \\"Sally Smith 1769\\" in the painting.

Generally these are unglazed earthenware where the red colour is easily visible in complete pieces. Examples of types include: Red Polished Ware, of which there are four main unrelated types, all ancient, from Egypt, India, Cyprus and Roman Europe; the Black and red ware culture of Bronze Age India (individual objects are either black or red); Roman \\"red gloss ware\\" or Terra sigillata; Late Roman African red slip ware; Salado or Roosevelt Red Ware, Arizona, c. 1280 to 1450 AD, and one form of Romano-British Crambeck Ware.
