Though not so titled by the composer, it is sometimes referred to as his String Quartet No. 4. A performance lasts a little more than nine minutes. History M√∫sica de feria was completed on 25 March 1932 and first performed on 7 November 1933 by the Cuarteto Cl√°sico (violinists Ezequiel Sierra and David Saloma, violist David Elizarrar√°s, and cellist Te√≥filo Ariza) at the Teatro Hidalgo in Mexico City . Revueltas had previously composed three numbered quartets in rapid succession in 1930‚Äì31, but this work was only first designated his String Quartet No. 4 in 1984, by the Cuarteto Latinoamericano and Juan Arturo Brennan. It is regarded as one of Revueltas's most important works . Of his four quartets, M√∫sica de feria is without question the one that has most often been performed and recorded . Analysis Fair at the Plaza de la Constituci√≥n, Mexico City M√∫sica de feria is written in a single movement which nevertheless incorporates the structure and development of a traditional quartet. A distinctive feature is the simultaneous presentation of independent melodic lines in each part but within a single rhythmic pattern . There is considerable disagreement about the musical structure. According to one interpretation, the quartet is seen as clearly falling into four main sections, corresponding in miniature to the structure of a traditional four-movement string quartet: Allegro (first movement), Lento (slow movement), Allegro giocoso (scherzo), and Allegro tempo I (finale) . Alternatively, the quartet is regarded as falling into just three large sections, each of which consists of a succession of three contrasting subsections. The opening section (Allegro‚ÄìVivo allegro) returns in slightly modified form at the end, thereby forming an overall ABC-DEF-ABC pattern. The central section is marked at its onset (D) by a slow tempo (Lento) employing ostinato patterns, but this gives way to increasingly faster material in the second and third subsections (E and F, Allegro tempo I and Giocoso, respectively). The recurrence of the opening section is almost literal in its A and B subsections, with the C section in an accelerated tempo, Presto y fren√©tico .

It stars Ian McKellen, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Watson, Vanessa Kirby, Sarah Lancashire, and Edward Fox. The story examines the relationship between an aging Shakespearean actor and his theatrical dresser, as well as the other members of his theatrical company, as he grapples with the approach of senility and irrelevance. Like the play which serves as its basis, the film's central relationship draws inspiration from Shakespeare's King Lear. The film premiered on BBC Two on 31 October 2015. Plot The film centres on the relationship between an ageing Shakespearean actor, named only as \\"Sir\\", and his theatrical dresser, Norman. It is set entirely in the backstage area (and briefly, the main stage) of a London playhouse during the Blitz. It opens with a meeting between Norman and Sir's (apparent) wife, \\"Her Ladyship\\", in Sir's dressing room following a difficult visit to Sir in hospital. At Her Ladyship's frantic behest, Norman explains the events which had led to Sir's admission. He had discovered Sir wandering the streets of London during an air raid: his erratic behaviour, including trampling his hat and coat and making a public spectacle, induced Norman to take him to the hospital, despite his being scheduled for a performance of King Lear that evening. Norman regrets this, while Her Ladyship, concerned for Sir's ability to perform, considers cancelling the performance on account of illness. Norman, who has been with Sir as his dresser for nearly thirty years, and has never seen his company cancel a performance, pleads with Her Ladyship and company stage manager Madge (Sarah Lancashire) to postpone the cancellation and allow him to visit Sir in the hospital. As he begs, Sir reappears in his dressing room, having \\"discharged himself\\" from medical care. Sir insists that he be allowed to prepare for the evening's performance, to the shock and dismay of Her Ladyship and Madge. Obviously exhausted, and approaching senility or dementia, the elderly Sir views each performance as essential to his reputation as a respected classical actor. Sir begins to prepare between bouts of amnesia and jealous weeping, accidentally blackening himself for the role of Othello instead of King Lear and forgetting the lines which begin the play; meanwhile, Norman attempts to defuse his flaring temper with silliness and reminiscing. Her Ladyship and Madge both attempt to check in on Sir, but Norman refuses to let them enter. Various members of the company, whose numbers have been dwindling with the loss of so many young actors to the war in Europe, appear for Sir's appraisal, including the pretty young actress Irene (Vanessa Kirby) toward whom Sir behaves inappropriately; demure and miscast Thornton (Edward Fox) in the role of Fool; and the standoffish Oxenby as Edmund, who refuses to \\"muck in\\" and assist with offstage production activities. Sir attempts to write in his memoirs without success. The performance finally begins, as the sheepish but obviously attention-hungry Norman makes a fool of himself in his curtain speech warning of the air raid. As the play approaches Sir's first entrance, it is unclear whether he will be physically able to perform; however, after initially missing his cue, he begins a passionate, inspired performance of the play's most important speeches. Oxenby begrudgingly assists with the backstage sounds for the storm scene, while Norman plainly relishes any role given to him in the running of the production. During the interval, Sir returns exhausted to his dressing room while Norman congratulates him and prepares him to sleep until his next entrance; however, Her Ladyship enters and awakens him, imploring him to retire from the stage following the performance. Sir refuses, and Her Ladyship laments his self-centred, egotistical nature and her own choice to live endlessly live in his shadow. It is revealed that Sir refused to divorce his first wife for Her Ladyship because he hoped to retain eligibility for a knighthood. She threatens to leave the company and Sir forever, but Sir pleads for her not to go; when it becomes apparent Her Ladyship has relented, he turns malicious and belittles her hopes for a life outside his shadow. After she leaves, Irene attempts to enter, but Sir has her summon Madge, to whom he tells his wishes for his press clippings of theatrical reviews for his career, and to whom he gives an heirloom ring from actor Edmund Kean. Madge reveals she has loved Sir since her time at the company began, which Sir uses to assuage his wounded ego. Irene then enters, and Sir makes a sexual advance after signing a photograph for her. Norman returns and jealously listens through the door. Sir takes Irene in his arms as he would Cordelia, then casts her off; as Irene exits, Norman accosts her about what occurred, but Irene refuses to divulge any information. Norman expels her from the company, against the authority of Sir. The play resumes, and Sir continues his exceptional performance. After the curtain falls, Sir changes out of his costume and shows some tenderness toward Norman, asking what will happen to him if Sir is unable to continue performing, an idea Norman dismisses. Thornton appears and expresses his joy at having played the principal role of Fool, extemporising on the opportunity theatre offers to even older actors. Sir becomes distant and withdrawn, dismissing Norman's attempts at cheer and preparation for the next night's performance of Richard III. Her Ladyship appears to say a spiteful goodnight, followed by Oxenby, who diminishes Sir's authority in the company. Sir becomes distraught, and Norman's attempts to comfort Sir as he lies down to sleep are largely ignored. Norman asserts that he is \\"never despairing,\\" and claims to be unconcerned about his own legacy, in contrast to Sir. Sir asks Norman to read aloud the dedication to his memoirs, which contain dedications to Her Ladyship and the \\"spirit of all actors and those who do the work of the theatre ... and the memory of William Shakespeare\\"; as Norman does so, Sir dies. Norman slowly realises this, and becomes distraught and spiteful towards Sir, who has failed to mention him in the dedications. He calls for Madge, who is tender with Sir's remains. While Madge telephones Her Ladyship to give her the news, Norman secretly adds \\"dressers\\" to the list of dedications. Norman is obviously contemptuous and expresses cowardice about his own future. As Madge begins to leave in tears, Norman claims he \\"wouldn't give [Sir] a good character in a court of law.\\" The two scrap, and Madge leaves distraught; Norman is left alone with Sir's body. He begins to tell one of the stories which used to cheer Sir, but stops himself.

As a former slave who had purchased his freedom, he publicly maimed himself to prevent being returned to slavery. Slavery and freedom Cornish was born a slave in Maryland in 1793. In 1839, his master hired him out to a railroad-building project in Port Leon in Florida's Panhandle. The position allowed him to earn money for himself, and after nine years of work at $600 a year, he was able to purchase his own freedom and that of his wife Lillah. However, the papers showing him to be free were destroyed in a fire. Lacking proof of his emancipation, he was seized by slave traders, but managed to break free. The next day he gathered a crowd of onlookers in Port Leon. He loudly proclaimed that, having purchased his freedom once, he would not return to slavery under any circumstances. He then deliberately maimed himself, stabbing himself in the leg, slashing the muscles of one ankle, and cutting off a finger of his left hand, which he proceeded to sew back on with a needle and thread. These injuries made him worthless as a slave and thus immune to recapture. Friends took him home in a wheelbarrow, and he eventually recovered his health. Key West Around 1850, he and Lillah bought a farm in Key West, in the area that is now Truman Avenue near Simonton Street. Selling vegetables and fruits to local residents, he became one of the richest people in Key West. He was a leader of the local black community and the founder of the Cornish Chapel of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, now the Cornish Memorial AME Zion church and chapel, which still stands at 702 Whitehead Street. He died in 1869 at the age of 76. He was buried in Key West Cemetery, but the location of his grave was lost to history. In 2014, the cemetery and the Historic Florida Keys Foundation installed a plaque to his memory. Speakers described his life as an inspiring testament to human freedom. City Commissioner Clayton Lopez, presiding over the ceremony, said, \\"His actions in life show that he was not going to accept the fate developed for him by lesser men. He is a legend that continues to point the way to human dignity to this day.\\" Recognition A memorial bust of Cornish is included in the Mallory Square Sculpture Garden, which honors people who had a significant impact on Key West.

Black ordered the expedition of Cleveland Bay to find a suitable site for a port and then established the Port of Townsville and the associated town of Townsville. He served for two terms as Mayor of Townsville. Early life Black was born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1830, the son of a physician. Black become a merchant and moved to London. It was there that he heard of the Australian goldfields. Victoria Black immigrated to Melbourne where he made his fortune, not by mining gold but by establishing a business as a carrier. In 1855 he established the first Theatre Royal in Melbourne on the north side of Bourke Street, able to hold more than 3000 people. The opening production was The School for Scandal. Although described as a \\"magnificent theatre\\", the ¬£60,000 cost of the theatre's construction ultimately bankrupted Black. Queensland John Melton Black's residence, the first home in Townsville built around 1865 Black was attracted to the opportunities of the new colony of Queensland. With W. A. Ross, C. S. Rowe and W. Longshaw, he formed a group to go furthest north and take up pastoral land. They reached Bowen on 18 April 1861, where they founded Fanning Station. This was near the site of the Macrossan Bridge. Black was claimed to be the first man to cross the Burdekin River with flocks and herds. He liked the prospects of North Queensland and at the end of 1863, he took up a further large area of land, which became known as Woodstock Station. However, harsh conditions forced him and many others to surrender their lands to the banks as they were unable to meet their heavy mortgage commitments. Then aged 34, he became general manager for Robert Towns' pastoral interests, which included Fanning, Woodstock, Inkerman, Jarvisfield and other large holdings. Headquarters were established at Woodstock, and the long haulage of goods from Bowen was found troublesome. On the map it could be seen that the nearest coast was but twenty miles away. When Andrew Ball and Mark Watt Reid were sent to explore, they made the discovery of Ross Creek in 1864. The new work of forming a port at Cleveland Bay and the establishment of the settlement of Townsville was undertaken by a partnership of Towns and Black. Black is credited with erecting the first wharf, surveying the first allotments and supervising the erection of its first buildings. He is said to have built the first house in Townsville. He was a stockman, merchant, surveyor, newspaper editor and pioneer of the meat industry in Townsville and surrounding districts. He served for two terms as Mayor of Townsville. Later life Black left Townsville at the end of the year 1867, and his loss was keenly felt by the residents of North Queensland. As there had been no farewell ceremony, it was arranged to send him presents of an illuminated address and a valuable gold cup. From Sydney he proceeded to Europe, where he made an extensive tour before settling down in London. There he established a printing business. At Hanover Square, London, he had married Marion O'Dowds, whom he first met in Townsville. Their family consisted of five sons and a daughter. Black died in 1919 aged 89 years. Legacy On Sunday 1 November 1964, a monument commemorating the \\"100th Anniversary of Settlement in Townsville\\" was unveiled on The Strand, with particular mention made of four men: Robert Towns, Andrew Ball, Mark Watt Reid and John Melton Black. As at 2020, the monument is located in Anzac Memorial Park between the Centenary Fountain and the bandstand (). Black River (both the river and the suburb of Townsville) are named after him. Melton Hill (the 50-metre hill) in Townsville City was named after him and was the name of the first land sale in Townsville; Black's home was on the top of Melton Hill. The road to the Townsville Airport is called John Melton Black Drive. References= Attribution = 20x20px 24x24px This Wikipedia article contains text from John Melton Black by W. J.

The battle formed part of the wider Salamaua‚ÄìLae campaign and was fought in the final stages of the campaign, which had seen a combined Australian and US force advance from Wau towards Salamaua following the repulse of the Japanese attack on Wau in late January and early February 1943. After several frontal assaults on the position by Australian and US infantrymen were rebuffed by determined Japanese defenders, an indirect approach was sought and flanking moves were undertaken to cut off the Japanese supply route along the Komiatum Track. This succeeded in eventually forcing the Japanese off the position as they withdrew to avoid encirclement. Background In late January and early February 1943, Japanese efforts to secure a vital airfield at Wau were checked by a small Australian force, leading to the end of Japanese attempts to capture Port Moresby. This victory was followed up by the Australians as they pushed into the surrounding area. Following actions around Mubo and Lababia Ridge in late June and early July 1943, the Australian troops from Brigadier Murray Moten's 17th Brigade was ordered to push towards the Komiatum and Mount Tambu area‚Äîabout from Salamaua‚Äîas the Allies advanced towards Salamaua, with a view to tying down Japanese reserves there, to divert their attention away from Lae. Battle The highest feature on the route between Mubo and Salamaua, Mount Tambu consisted of a series of steep razorback ridges that were covered in dense jungle. Throughout July and August, troops from the Second Australian Imperial Force 2/5th and 2/6th Infantry Battalions and the Militia 42nd Infantry Battalion, undertook a series of actions around Mount Tambu and Komiatum. The area was defended by around 700 Japanese troops, from two battalions of the 66th Infantry Regiment under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Fukuzo Kimura and Major Sakai Sugiyama; initially the position was defended by only Sugiyama's II Battalion but in mid-July, Kimura's III Battalion arrived to reinforce them. These actions were fought in conjunction with actions in the surrounding area, which also included attacks on Bobdubi, an amphibious landing by US troops at Nassau Bay and actions around Roosevelt Ridge. Leslie Allen, an Australian stretcher bearer, evacuates an American soldier wounded during the fighting on Mount Tambu The initial Allied assault was made by troops from the 2/5th on 16 July 1943 and the Australians secured part of the southern slopes of Mount Tambu. The Japanese began to counter-attack that night but were repulsed with heavy losses: the Australians suffered 39 casualties, including 14 killed, while the Japanese lost around 350 men in the eight attacks before dawn. Shortly after this, Kimura's battalion arrived to reinforce the Japanese positions as the Japanese high command determined the need to hold Tambu. On 24 July, the 2/5th launched a further attack across a steep ravine, which had to be crossed to reach the summit of the position. A small group reached the top but they were eventually forced off following fierce fighting. On the periphery, the 58th/59th and 2/7th Infantry Battalion were heavily engaged around the \\"Old Vickers\\" position, during the fighting around Bobdubi, while the 24th Infantry Battalion was engaged in \\"security and diversionary roles\\", trying to draw Japanese forces away from the main Australian forces. On 28 July, the several companies‚Äîconsisting of about 400 men‚Äîfrom the 1st Battalion, 162nd Infantry Regiment, which had landed at Nassau Bay earlier in the month, arrived and relieved some of the Australian forces in the forward positions around Mount Tambu. Australian mortar crews and stretcher bearers remained in the line supporting the US troops, while one company from the Australian 2/5th Infantry Battalion continued to maintain a base around the mountain. On 30 July, an uphill company-level attack was made by the American troops, which failed. For his efforts in rescuing 12 wounded US soldiers during the attack while under fire, an Australian stretcher bearer from the 2/5th Infantry Battalion, Corporal Leslie Allen, was awarded the US Silver Star; his actions were captured in a photograph by Gordon Short. The Australian commander, Moten, looked for an indirect approach, focusing upon cutting the Japanese defenders' supply route along the Komiatum Track. This was completed on 16 August 1943, when the 2/6th Infantry Battalion secured the southern part of the Komiatum Ridge and then held it against determined Japanese counter-attacks, supported from its flanks by heavy machine gun fire from the 2/5th and small arms from the 42nd from Davidson Ridge. The Japanese defenders then withdrew from the position as they became threatened with encirclement. Aftermath Operations in the area continued for the rest of August and into September as the Japanese fought to hold the Allied advance on their final defensive line in front of Salamaua. Nevertheless, the Francisco River was crossed in late August, and the main Japanese position around Charlie Hill was taken in the first week of September. The Allies also launched a seaborne landing near Lae and an airborne landing at Nadzab as part of an operation to secure Lae, which Allied planners considered more important than Salamaua. Pressure had been maintained on Salamaua in an effort to draw reinforcements away from Lae but as the Lae operation developed, the Japanese moved about 5,000 to 6,000 troops away from Salamaua by sea, abandoning the badly bomb damaged town. In early September, Major General Edward Milford's 5th Division headquarters took over from the 3rd Division and the Australians launched the final effort to secure Salamaua.

First built in 1855, it was located at what is now 236 Bourke Street, Melbourne, in the heart of what was once the city's theatre and entertainment district.  History  The Theatre Royal was built in 1855 by John Melton Black. It was capable of holding 3300 people and was comparable in size to London's Drury Lane and Covent Garden theatres. The opening production was Richard Sheridan's The School for Scandal. Described as a \\"magnificent theatre\\", the ¬£60,000 cost of the theatre's construction ultimately bankrupted Black. A religious service held at the Theatre Royal on a Sunday, when the theatres were closed, c1873 In April 1872 the theatre burned down, but was immediately rebuilt bigger and better by George Coppin, the well known actor, theatre manager, entrepreneur, philanthropist and politician. The new theatre could seat 4,000 people over four tiers, and opened in November the same year. It was remodelled in 1904, seating fewer people more comfortably on three tiers, but the growing popularity of the moving pictures in the 1920s affected theatre attendance, and the effects of the Great Depression led to the closure of the theatre in 1932. In 1933 it was finally demolished, and replaced by Manton's department store, later becoming a Coles store, itself redeveloped into a Target store in the 1970s.

Her repertoire covers khyals, thumri and dadra. Biography Subhra Guha was born in Calcutta in 1956. Her family encouraged her to pursue Hindustani classical music, as she showed talent in music from a young age. Initially, she learnt music under Satish Bhowmick. From 1970, she trained in singing in Agra gharana style under Sunil Bose. From 1982, for ten years, she was a student at the ITC Sangeet Research Academy in Kolkata where she was taught by K. G. Ginde and Bhowmick. She learned thumri rendition from D. T. Joshi. In spite of the macho nature of the Agra gharana style of music, with her own sense of layakari (rhythmic play) and strong tone, she became proficient by creating her own style of gayaki under the guidance of Vijay Kichlu, director of the academy. She joined the academy as guru and taught between 1992 and 2003 and again in recent years. She is the only woman student of the Academy to be appointed as a guru in the same institution. Guha has performed in many concerts nationally and also in the US, Europe, and Asia. She has recorded albums for HMV and many other recording companies. She recorded playback music for Goutam Ghoses film, Yatra. She performs regularly on All India Radio and Doordarshan. She is also known for her Poorab Ang renditions of thumri. Awards In 2015, Guha received the Girija Shankar Smriti Puruskar award from the Government of West Bengal.

The Taliparamba-Kannur-Thalassery area abounds in rock-cut caves, dolmens, burial stone circles and menhirs, all of megalithThe district was part of the Chera kingdom, which ruled most of Kerala during the first several centuries CE. Later Kannur was the capital of the Kolattiri Rajas, whose kingdom had trading relations with Arabia and Persia in the 12th century and 13th centuries. In his book on travels (Il Milione), Marco Polo recounts his visit to the area in mid 1290s. Other visitors included Faxian, the Buddhist pilgrim and Ibn Batuta, writer and historian of Tangiers. It is said that the ships of Solomon had anchored along the coasts of Kannur to collect timber for building the Temple of the Lord. Kannur also finds mention as Naura in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a Greek work of great antiquity. The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama visited Kannur in 1498. Shortly thereafter it became a Portuguese settlement. The Portuguese led by Don Francisco de Almeda, the first Portuguese viceroy for India, built the St. Angelo's Fort north of Kannur in 1505. In 1663 the Dutch captured the fort. In 1790 the British captured the fort. At present, it is under the control of the Archaeological Survey of India. In the latter half of the 18th century, Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, rulers of Mysore, conquered much of the district and came into conflict with the British. In 1792, at the conclusion of the Third Anglo-Mysore War, the British took over Kannur and the surrounding region, which became the new Malabar District of British India's Madras Presidency. Resistance to British rule Kannur District witnessed one of the longest and bloodiest resistance to British rule in India. This revolt led by Pazhassi Raja in the 1792‚Äì1806 period kept a large part of the district in a state of war. Veera Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja. Painting by Raja Ravi Varma Indian freedom movement Kannur District played an important role in the Indian freedom movement. The Indian National Congress, founded in 1885, established a Malabar District committee in 1908. A branch of the All India Home Rule League, founded by Dr. Annie Besant, functioned in Thalassery during this period and among its active workers was V.K. Krishna Menon. By the end of 1939, a branch of the Communist Party of India was formally established at Pinarayi, a village near Thalassery. The decision by the Nagpur Congress to give up constitutional methods of agitation and resort to non-violent non-co-operation as a means of achieving swaraj led to the widespread boycott of foreign goods, courts of law and educational institutions in Kannur. Mahatma Gandhi and Maulana Shaukat Ali toured the district to carry the message of the Non-Co-operation and Khilafat Movements. The Khilafat movement of 1921 was an uprising of Muslims against the British for abolishing the Islamic Chaliphate in West Asia and resulted in the formation of a secular Turkey. Civil disobedience movement Payyannur was the main venue of the Salt Satyagraha, a major turning point in the Indian Freedom Movement, in Malabar. On 13 April 1930, a batch of Congress volunteers under the leadership of K. Kelappan started on foot from Kozhikode to the beaches of Payyannur and broke the salt laws there on 21 April. The Satyagraha camp at Payyannur was raided and the campers were beaten up. The Uliyath Kadav Payyanur incident became a turning point in the history of freedom struggle in Kerala. It thrilled the people and thousands were ready to join in the struggle for freedom. There were widespread demonstrations in Kannur, Thalassery and other parts of the district and a number of Congress workers were arrested. The period following the withdrawal of the civil disobedience Movement witnessed the emergence of radical wing in the Kerala Provincial Congress. Some of the radical elements in the Kerala Provincial Congress organized a Kerala unit of the Congress Socialist Party in 1934 and functioned as a separate group within the Provincial Congress. The leadership of this group was in the hands of people like P. Krishna Pillai, A.K. Gopalan and E. M. S. Namboodiripad. K.V.Kunhikkannan Nair of Kadachira, Kannur, a socialist leader. An extremist group of Nationalist Muslims emerged within the Congress during this period under the leadership of Muhammad Abdur Rahiman. The Congress Socialists and the Nationalist Muslims made common cause against the Gandhian group known as the Right Wing which was led by such leaders as K. Kelappan, C.K. Govindan Nair and K.A. Damodara Menon. A notable development in the politics of Malabar during the 1930s was the rise of the Muslim League as a district political party. The Muslim leaders Kannur and Thalassery played the lead roles in forming this organization. The leftist elements in the Kerala Provincial Congress were also active in the politics of Malabar in the late 30s. They took an active part in organizing the workers, peasants, students and teachers of Kannur district under their banner. In the election held to the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee in January 1939, the Rightists suffered a severe setback. Muhammad Abdur Rahiman Sahib was elected as the president of the K.P.C.C and E. M. S. Namboodiripad as its general secretary. Towards the end of the same year, a branch of the Indian Communist Party was formally founded in Malabar. The Congress Socialist Party workers joined the Communist Party en bloc. Payyannur Conference Kannur district became the focus of Kerala politics in May 1928, when the fourth All Kerala Political Conference was held at Payyannur under the auspices of the Kerala Provincial Congress. This conference was presided over by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. The Payyannur Conference passed a resolution requesting the Indian National Congress to adopt 'Complete Independence' instead of \\"Swaraj\\" as its goal at the annual session scheduled to take place at Calcutta during that year. Morazha Incident The KPCC gave a call to the people of Malabar to observe 15 September 1940 as Anti-Imperialist Day. The action was disapproved by the Congress High Command, but there were meetings and demonstrations all over Malabar on this day. Kannur district was the centre of this agitation. There were violent clashes between the people and the police at several places and lathicharge and firing were resorted to by the police to meet the situation. Two young men were killed in a clash between a mob and a police party at Morazha. The men were police officers Sub-Inspector K.M Kuttikrishna Menon and Constable Raman. In connection with this incident, K.P.R. Gopalan, a prominent communist, was arrested on a charge of murder and later sentenced to death. But, owing to the intervention of several top-ranking political leaders, including Mahatma Gandhi, the death penalty was not carried out. The Quit India Movement of August 1942 also had its echoes in Kannur district. A socialist group among the Congress workers under Dr. K.B. Menon, provided leadership to the movement. Salt Sathyagraha Payyannur was the main venue of the Salt Sathyagraha in Malabar. On 13 April, a batch of Congress volunteers under the leadership of K. Kelappan started on foot from Kozhikode to the beaches of Payyannur and broke the salt laws there on 21 April. The Satyagraha camp at Payyannur was raided and the campers were beaten up. There were widespread demonstrations in Kannur, Thalassery and other places. Congress workers broke salt laws and picketed foreign good dealers and liquor shops. The period following the withdrawal of the Civil Disobedience Movement witnessed the emergence of a radical wing in the Kerala Provincial Congress. Some of the radical elements in the Kerala Provincial Congress organised a Kerala unit of the Congress Socialist Party in 1934 and functioned as a separate group within the Provincial Congress. The leadership of this group was in the hands of persons like P. Krishna Pillai, A.K. Gopalan and E.M.S. Namboothiripad. An extremist group of Nationalist Muslims also emerged within the Congress during this period under the leadership of Muhammad Abdur Rahiman. The Congress Socialists and the Nationalist Muslims made common cause against the Gandhian group known as the Right Wing which was led by such leaders as K. Kelappan, C.K. Govindan Nair and K.A. Damodara Menon. A notable development in the politics of Malabar during the thirties was the rise of the Muslim League as a district political party. It was the Muslim leaders of Kannur and Thalassery who played the lead role in forming this organisation. The leftist elements in the Kerala Provincial Congress were also active in the politics of Malabar in the late thirties. They took active part in organising the workers, peasants, students and teachers of Kannur district under their banner. In the election held to the Kerala Provincial Congress Committee in January 1939, the Rightists suffered a severe set back. Muhammad Abdur Rahiman was elected as the president of the K.P.C.C. and E.M.S. Namboothiripad as its general secretary. Towards the end of the same year, a branch of the Indian Communist Party was formally founded in Malabar. The Congress Socialist Party workers joined the Communist Party block. Peasant struggles World War II, especially in the period from 1943 to 1945, ravaged the district. Famine and a cholera epidemic took thousands of lives from the lower strata of society. On the initiative of the people under the leadership of the Kisan Sabha, commendable services were rendered to tide over the crisis. The \\"Grow More Food Campaign\\", organized at Mangattuparamba by the Kisan Sabha, was a new chapter in the history of mass movement. More than of government land was brought under cultivation. However, the government suppressed the movement by force and destroyed the farm. Though the war ended in 1945, famine continued to haunt the people. Karivellor, Poomaram (Thillenkeri) the northernmost village of the present Kannur district, made a historic stride in the struggle against poverty and famine. The transporting of paddy rice from Karivellore to Chirakkal Kovilakom was blocked and distributed to the people of the village. The movement was led by peasant leaders such as A.V. Kunhambu and K. Krishnan Master. One Kannan and Kunhambu became martyrs in the struggle when police opened fire. During December 1946, the people of Kavumbayi, an eastern village of the district, raised their demand for punam cultivation. A strong police contingent was sent to the spot. The peasants resisted the armed forces which led to the killing of five peasants in the firing. The rise of the organized working class in the industrial sector was another important phenomenon of the period that changed the course of the anti-imperialism movement. The struggle of Aron Mill workers in 1946 is noteworthy in this regard. Even after independence, the struggles of the peasantry formed an important part in the history of the state. They fought against landlords and their exploitation. Places like Thillankeri, Manayankunnu, Korom and Paddikkunnu are memorable in the annals of the peasant struggles in the post independence era. The All India Conference of Kisan Sabha, held at Kannur in 1953, resolved to initiate struggles for new tenancy legislation. The movement for Aikya Kerala also got momentum during this period and all sections of the society rallied under the movement. St. Angelos Fort St. Angelo Fort was built in 1505 by Dom Francisco de Almeida, the first Portuguese Viceroy of India. It is situated by the Laccadive Sea about 3 km from Kannur town. In 1507, the fort was besieged by the local ruler; the Portuguese rule over Cananor (as they spelt it) would last 158 years and then replaced by the Dutch. The ownership of the fort has changed hands several times. In 1663, the Dutch captured it. They subsequently gave the fort its present appearance. The Dutch sold the fort to the Arakkal Royal family in 1772. During this time, the Arakkal Sultanate began issuing coins.Arakkal royal family The British conquered it in 1790 and used it as one of their major military stations on the Malabar Coast. It is fairly well preserved as a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India. A painting of this fort and the fishing ferry as a background is on display at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Kunjali Marakkar's head was removed from his body and exhibited in the fort after his assassination. Muslim Dynasty During the 17th century, Kannur was the capital city of the only Muslim Sultanate in India, known as Arakkal. During the British Raj, Kannur was part of the Madras province in the North Malabar District. The guerrilla war by Pazhassi Raja, the ruler of Kottayam province, against the British had a huge impact in the history of Kannur. Changes in the socio-economic and political sectors in Kerala during the initial decades of 20th century created conditions congenial for the growth of the Communist Party. Reformist Movements New strains of thought developed as capitalist transformation laid the foundation for the commencement of social reform movements in sections of society. At the all India level, Vivekananda and others put forward such thoughts. Against this background social reform movements started by Sree Narayana Guru, Ayyankali and others in southern parts of Kerala and by Vagbhatananda and others in northern parts got developed into movements against superstition and bad customs. These evoked a big stirring among the people. An attitude against untouchability and casteism and interest in acquiring modern education were evident among all sections. Pressures for the same started developing in the society. Extension of English education initiated by Christian missionaries in 1906 and later carried forward by government, rebellion for wearing a cloth to cover upper parts of body, installing an idol at Aruvippuram in 1888, Malayali Memorial in 1891, establishment of SNDP Yogam in 1903, activities, struggles etc. became factors helpful to accelerate changes in Kerala society during a short time. Movements for liberation from the colonial rule of British imperialism and struggles launched by these movements grew with them. During this period, social renaissance movements and independence movement were growing. Ideas about socialism and Soviet Revolution reached Kerala. Such ideas got propagated in Kerala through the works of Swadeshabhimani Ramakrishna Pillai, Sahodaran Ayyappan, P. Kesavadev and others. Socialist Movements During this period against the background of sufferings inflicted by Janmithama(a system wherein feudal landlords controlled land)nd imperialism, struggles and organizations of peasants and workers started emerging slowly. The practice of collective bargaining by working people also started. The peasant rebellion known as Malabar Rebellion of 1921 and consequent political changes highly influenced the independence movement of Kerala. City of Cannanore, 1572 A number of Kerala youth were jailed during this period for participating in ‚Äòviolation of law‚Äô movement as part of independence movement. At this time Kiran Chandra Das (brother of Jithendra Das), Kamal Nath Thivari, Sen Gupta, T.N. Chandravarthi and Sarath Chandra Acharya were in a Kannur jail and Jayadev Kapur in a Vellore jail. Malayalee youngsters got an opportunity to get acquainted with them, be suggested books to read, and discuss issues. They came to know of many new aspects of political work. This gave them a new sense of direction. E.M.S writes about this: > \\"It will not be a big exaggeration to say that seeds of left, Congress and > Congress Socialist movements were sown at Kannur jail and that too by > Thivari.\\" It was youth dissatisfied by the Congress policy which was afraid of people's advance who were attracted to the socialist idea. At that time there was an atmosphere in Kerala which gave strength to such thoughts. People were suffering a lot due to persecution by landlords. Against this resistance and organizations were cropping up here and there. In 1935 July a meeting of peasants were held in the Bharatheeya building in Naniyoor in Kolachery Amsom of old Chirakkal Taluk. Kolachery Karshaka Sangham was formed with Vishnu Bharatheeyan as president and K.A. Keraleeyan as secretary. By September 1935, Karivelloor Karshaka Sangham was formed which represented round Karivelloor, Velloor, Peralam and Kotakkad. With the formation of All India Kisan Sabha in 1936 a new front of struggle was opened in agrarian sector. The Hunger March led by AKG in 1936 July raising the demands of peasants imparted a new vigour to this sector. Following this a number of Karshaka Sangham were formed in Malabar. In 1936 November the first Karshaka Conference of Chirakkal Taluk was held at Parassinikkadavu. In 1937 All Malabar conference of Karshaka Sangham was held in Kozhikode. This awakening among peasants prepared the ground for the advent of a new political movement. Trade unions started to be formed and strengthened. Global economic crisis of 1929 started creating serious consequences in Indian economy as well. First Travancore Labour Association came into being. Such organizations later became militant trade unions. Strikes were organized in Kozhikkode, Kannur, Pappinisseri, Thalassery and other centres of commerce which further strengthened trade unions. In 1935 May the first Kerala Workers‚Äô conference was held at Kozhikode. This initiative to bring up working class as an independent class force prepared the ground for propagating Communist ideas. During this period coir workers in Travancore got organized and achieved strength. In Kochi organizations like Cochin Sterling Workers‚Äô Union were being formed. Labour brotherhood and trade unions of Alagappa Textiles and Sitaram Mills were formed. In 1937 second All Kerala Workers‚Äô Conference was held at Thrissur. This organizational consciousness developed among workers prepared the ground for a new politics. By the beginning of the 1930s some other useful developments were taking place. Important among them was Nivarthana Agitation in Travancore. That was the demand of people suppressed so far as untouchables and weaker sections for participation in government. This brought to the forefront struggles like proportional representation in government and reservation of jobs. This imparted a new enthusiasm among oppressed masses.

It was built from 1865 to 1930s. It is also known as Townsville General Cemetery. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 June 1996.  History  West End Cemetery, surveyed in 1865, was Townsville's first official cemetery and second burial ground. The first burial ground was located north of the main settlement along the beach in North Ward, but this was abandoned within a couple of years as settlement spread rapidly north around Castle Hill. It was not an officially gazetted cemetery, and was not included in the first town plan of Townsville, completed early in 1865. The first official Townsville General Cemetery (West End Cemetery) was surveyed along with Townsville's first suburban allotments, west of the main settlement on Ross Creek, in November 1865. It comprised 19 acres of Suburban Section 1 at the base of Castle Hill, and was bounded by unmade road reserves to the west, north and east, and separated from the main track into Townsville (later Flinders Street West) by private allotments. Although not officially gazetted as a cemetery reserve until 1872, the burial ground was used from at least March 1868 when Captain Henry Daniel Sinclair, founder of Bowen, was buried there. Prior to 1872 there was no official administration of the West End Cemetery. In 1868 a committee was established to raise funds to fence the cemetery, and this was completed by July 1869, but there were no trustees and no burial register was being kept. Finally, in August 1872, the Townsville Cemetery Reserve at West End was gazetted and trustees were appointed, following which cemetery rules were gazetted in July 1873 and a burial register established later that year. Prior to 1880, access to the cemetery was over privately owned land between Flinders Street West and the reserve. In June 1880 the trustees succeeded in having the cemetery reserve extended to include Lot 1 of Suburban Section 1, a 4 acre allotment adjoining the cemetery and fronting Flinders Street West, in order to create official access to the cemetery from the main road into Townsville. However, this extension was cancelled in 1884 and the land reserved for school purposes. In 1886 the southeast corner of the original cemetery reserve was excised for school reserve as well, and new access to the main road was established with the addition to the cemetery of Lot 4 of Suburban Section 1 (5 acres at the corner of Church Street and Flinders Street West). When surveyed in 1865, the cemetery was well outside the town boundaries. However, within a decade settlement was developing around the Carriers Arms Hotel at what had become known as Townsville's West End. By 1878 a soap works, foundry and commercial buildings, together with Frederick Ashton's estate, were located close to the burial site, now situated within the town boundaries. By the 1890s West End was a thriving suburb as well as a commercial and business centre, and a state school had been established on the reserve at the corner of Wilson and Flinders Street West, adjacent to the cemetery. As the suburb grew concern was expressed that the cemetery was badly located at the base of Castle Hill. The community was worried that rainwater leaching from the hill was likely to contaminate a nearby creek, and in the 1890s the trustees searched for an alternative location for Townsville's general cemetery. On 10 November 1900 a new cemetery reserve of 100 acres at Belgian Gardens, on the Townsville Town Common, was proclaimed. The sale of burial plots at West End Cemetery ceased in 1902, but the cemetery was not closed at this time. With the establishment of the new cemetery at Belgian Gardens, lack of revenue for maintenance at the West End Cemetery became a major issue. In 1901 the trustees relinquished the unfenced part of the cemetery, about 3 acres at the corner of Flinders Street West and Church Street, reducing the size of the cemetery reserve to 16 acres. The excised land was gazetted a recreation reserve, administered by the Townsville Municipal Council. However, in 1910 the recreation reserve (minus a road reserve - now Pridmore Street) was returned to the cemetery reserve, the Council having failed to carry out improvements. It remained a constant source of annoyance to the cemetery trustees that their resources were being spent on maintaining ground which did not contain graves. However, the new road reserve created formal access from Flinders Street West to the main entrance gate and tree lined road through the cemetery. West End Cemetery was closed officially in 1930, with only previously purchased plots used for burials after that time. Since 1930 up to 288 people have been buried in family graves at West End. Further changes to the cemetery boundary were made in 1935 when 3 acres, excised from the north east corner, was added to the adjacent school reserve. During the Second World War a Civil Construction Corp camp was established on the unfenced section of the cemetery reserve at the corner of Church Street and Flinders Street West. It is believed that the cemetery entrance gates and turnstile at the end of Pridmore Street were removed at this time and a new entrance created off Church Street. This unfenced area was again excised from the cemetery reserve in 1958 to create the present recreation reserve. Since that time the cemetery reserve has comprised just under 15 acres. Two important firms of monumental masons working in Townsville made significant contributions to the monumental architecture in the West End Cemetery. From the late 19th century until 1984, Melrose and Fenwick produced both headstones and wrought iron grave surrounds; Whebells, operating from the late 19th century to the 1950s, made headstones. On 24 December 1971 Cyclone Althea caused considerable damage to headstones and trees at West End Cemetery, and vandalism and neglect have added to the damage. However, in recent years the local community has campaigned for the cemetery to be preserved, and in 1996 the Townsville City Council commissioned the preparation of a conservation policy to give direction and guidelines for the future care and maintenance of West End Cemetery.  Description  West End Cemetery, Townsville is located on the southern slope of Castle Hill and is bounded to the north by unmade road reserve (Francis Street), on the west by Church Street, on the south by a recreation reserve fronting Flinders Street West and residential allotments fronting Norman and Musgrave Streets, and on the east by a school reserve. The West End Cemetery in July 2019 The site is dissected east-west by two unmade paths, dividing the cemetery into Blocks A and C to the south, Block B between the paths, and Block D to the north. These paths meet a creek running through the eastern side of the cemetery. Between the creek and the school reserve on the eastern boundary is Block E, which was reserved for unsanctified burials. The graves of Chinese, Jewish and Aboriginal people as well as members of lodges and those who committed suicide are buried in this section. Only a small number of headstones remain in Block E and it is possible some graves have been washed away during floods because cast iron and headstone fragments can be found in the creek. Unlike many cemeteries, West End, with the exception of the unsanctified section across the creek, is not divided into denominational sections. However, all graves are oriented to the east in usual fashion. Large banyan, fig and mango trees are the main plantings. An avenue of mahogany trees, running north-south from the adjacent recreation reserve, marks the original entrance off the end of Pridmore Street. There is an early perimeter fence of rendered masonry with cast iron panels along the Church Street boundary, with the roots of mature banyans grown over the fence and nearby graves. The main entrance, off Church Street, appears to have been constructed at the same time as the fence. West End Cemetery contains many substantial headstones of quality design and craftsmanship, which illustrate trends in Queensland monumental architectural from the 1860s to the early 20th century. The oldest headstone in the cemetery dates from 4 March 1868. Materials used include marble, sandstone, granite and a concrete and pebble mix. The first marble headstones were imported from Carrara in Italy. After the beginning of the Second World War in 1939, marble from Ulam near Rockhampton was used. Sandstone, which was not available locally, was brought from Helidon Quarry near Toowoomba, Coffs Harbour in New South Wales and from around Sydney. The only local material identified is granite from Magnetic Island and pink granite from Hervey Range and Castle Hill. More recent headstones and graves are made from cast concrete and are less ornate. Of the graves established between 1896 and 1919, 52 percent are surrounded by ironwork.  Notable burials  Thomas Campbell's headstone, 2012 Many early inhabitants of Townsville and North Queensland are buried in West End Cemetery: * Andrew Ball, founder of Townsville and a prominent businessman in the infant town, was buried in 1894 * John Deane, Member of both the Queensland Legislative Assembly and Queensland Legislative Council * Thomas Campbell, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly * William Hann, an early settler in the Kennedy District was buried in 1889 * Charles Rowe, a partner with John Melton Black in the establishment of Black's pastoral empire in North Queensland was interred in 1900 * Thankful Willmett, printer and businessman * George Burns, MLA * Captain Henry Daniel Sinclair, founder of Bowen A large mound in Block A is said to be a communal grave for child victims of an 1890s epidemic.  Heritage listing  West End Cemetery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 June 1996 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. West End Cemetery is important because it provides evidence of the history and demography of Townsville and district. It also demonstrates architectural trends in monumental design during the latter half of the 19th and early 20th century. West End Cemetery served as Townsville's General Cemetery from to 1902, and contains the graves of people important in the history of Townsville, the region and Queensland generally. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. In consequence, the cemetery provides a unique source of historical information about the development of Townsville and of North Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place remains a substantially intact example of a 19th Queensland cemetery, containing early headstones, plantings and perimeter fencing. In illustrating its type, the cemetery is an important source of information about the work of monumental masons and the history of cemetery design and aesthetics in Queensland. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The diverse collection of memorials, the location at the base of Castle Hill, the plantings and perimeter fencing, also exhibit significant and evocative aesthetic characteristics.

Plot David Maddox consoles his wife Eveleigh as she regains consciousness in a hospital. Eveleigh recalls being in a fatal car accident that killed a child in the other vehicle. A year later Eveleigh (now three months pregnant) and David prepare to reopen a vineyard they purchased in Paso Robles, California. Top area wine distributor Helena Knoll attends a party for the couple and Eveleigh finds the woman muttering in a strange trance while alone inside their house. Eveleigh begins suffering from nightmares and hallucinations and comes to believe something supernatural may be haunting her or the house. Eveleigh also starts attending a yoga class where she makes friends with a pregnant woman named Sadie. Sadie accompanies Eveleigh on a visit to realtor Glenn Barry. Glenn reports that the vineyard house has no horrible history, but tells Eveleigh that she may wish to research prior owners the Porters for answers regarding possible paranormal activity. Eveleigh's visions continue intensifying. Worried that her PTSD has returned and is to blame for her hallucinations, David and Eveleigh's OB/GYN Dr. Mathison insist that she resume taking the anti-depressants she previously stopped due to pregnancy. Eveleigh reluctantly relents and the visions finally cease. Several months later, Eveleigh reconnects with Sadie, who convinces Eveleigh to stop taking her medication. Eveleigh's haunting visions return and she also begins suspecting a secret conspiracy against her that David might be involved in. Eveleigh contacts Jane Porter after learning that she had been researching ghosts and poltergeists. Jane leads Eveleigh back to Helena Knoll to ask about the trance she had at the party. Also sensitive to supernatural phenomena, Helena accompanies Eveleigh to the ruins of a destroyed home that previously existed on the vineyard's property. Both women experience a vision. Helena tells Eveleigh that psychic violence can echo throughout time and some kind of paranormal activity imprinted itself upon the land. Helena collapses suddenly. Before dying, Helena says to Eveleigh, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not what you think. It‚Äôs you.‚Äù Eveleigh visits vintner Victor Napoli, whose family owned her vineyard a century earlier. Victor tells Eveleigh that his great-grandmother burned down the old house on the property because of paranormal activity. He then shows her sketches from when a medium tried contacting spirits in the home. Eveleigh is shocked to see that the sketches depict her and David. Eveleigh comes home to an intervention staged by David, Dr. Mathison, Eveleigh's friend Eileen, and family therapist Victoria Lambert. Eveleigh tries explaining that she was not being haunted, but rather having premonitions that also haunted the past. The Porter and Napoli families were experiencing premonitions of a future tragedy that Eveleigh realizes is about to take place that night. Sadie arrives at the front door with her husband Ben. Both of them are armed with guns. Victoria tries to run and Ben shoots her as the room erupts in commotion. Eveleigh realizes that every vision she had was showing her a glimpse of events currently taking place. David discovers Sadie is not actually pregnant when he stabs her stomach. Sadie turns the knife on David and he falls to the floor. Eveleigh pushes Sadie through a glass door and flees. Ben kills Eileen before running after Eveleigh. He then kills a neighboring farmer before confronting Eveleigh. Eveleigh is attacked from behind and knocked unconscious. Eveleigh wakes to find herself being held captive by Ben and Sadie.

Noted for their harmonies, they became one of the most popular bands in the local area and toured throughout the Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana region, enjoying a following outside of their immediate vicinity. The group released a single featuring the song \\"William Junior\\" in 1966. In the intervening years since their breakup, the Novas' music has come to the attention of garage rock collectors and enthusiasts and their collected work is included on two anthologies. History The Novas were made up of members from Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas and formed in 1963 when guitarists John Salih and David Browne began playing as a duo, eventually expanding into a combo by adding Mike Mullen on bass and Gary Madrigal on drums. They adopted the name the Novas, taken after the popular compact-sized automobile of the time, the Chevrolet Nova. Catalog# CLS1147 The band specialized in playing popular surf rock instrumentals of the day made popular by acts such a s the Ventures, the Surfaris, and the Astronauts and did some vocal numbers by Chuck Berry as well as \\"Louie Louie\\" by the Kingsmen. They made their first impression at a Junior High School talent show when they were cheered on by screaming girls, in similar fashion to the euphoria surrounding the Beatles' recent inaugural visit to the United States in February 1964. They became the most popular band at their school and eventually in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. They eventually developed a sound which included rich vocal harmonies, which enabled them to do songs that most bands could not do and earned them a reputation as having the best harmonies of any rock band in North Texas. The Novas used black 1950s model Cadillac hearse with their band's logo painted on the side to travel from gig to gig and carry their equipment. The band played at popular clubs in the Dallas and Fort Worth area. Several establishments were teen clubs such as Panther Hall, Teen a Go Go, the Action a Go Go, as well as the infamous adult strip club the Cellar, which clandestinely allowed teenage groups to perform. In 1965, due to parental pressure, Mike Mullen departed and the group brought in David Dennard, previously of the surf band the Esquires, as his replacement. The Novas showcased a wide range of influences as disparate as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys, the Kinks, the Yardbirds, the Who, as well as much of the soul music popular at the time. The band grew their hair to reflect the longer Beatle-inspired look, but it caused them problems for in the straight and conservative Texas, where the crew-cut still held sway and where the mere sight of bangs and hair grown just over the tops of men's ears was still considered shocking. The group began writing their own songs and in 1966 released a single on Dallas' S.T.A.R. label, featuring two of their self- penned numbers, \\"William Junior\\" which was rife with social commentary about a child of privilege backed with \\"And It's Time.\\" The Novas played at local venues such as the Studio club and Market Hall and toured, often traveling in a station wagon on a shoestring budget, staying at motels, playing gigs throughout Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. On March 25, 1966 the Novas made a lip-synched appearance on the local TV show Sump'n Else along with the 13th Floor Elevators and played on the same bill with the 13th Floor Elevators that night at the \\"Spring Clean Up\\" show held at Market Hall. The Novas opened for the Byrds, the Hollies, Paul Revere & the Raiders, Mitch Ryder, the Spencer Davis Group, Sonny & Cher, and the Blues Magoos. The band recorded a number of unreleased songs, including material for a single that was intended for release in 1968 for the G.P.C. label, but never saw the light of day. With college looming the Novas broke up following high school graduation in 1968. The Novas' music has come to the attention of garage rock collectors and enthusiasts, and their collected recordings appear on the 1996 anthologies The Sump'n Else Tapes put out by Collectibles Records and William Junior, released on the Distortions label. Former band members are interviewed in Melissa Kirkendall's documentary Teen a Go Go.

Etymology  It is believed that in ancient times there were many small churches in the forest regions including Nilakkal and Thulappally as a result by the visit of St. Thomas in 52 AD. Places like Thulappally and Plappally in the forest were named after these churches. The head church of all these churches were known as Thalappally (Thala means head and pally means church) and which in course of time became \\"Thulappally\\".  Geography  Basically Thulappally is classified as Malanad (geographic division of Kerala) or high land with an altitude ranging from above mean sea level. The place is located near to the sacred forest regions (Poongavanam) of Sabarimala with comparatively less population. River Pamba flows westwards through the northern part of Thulappally.  Pilgrim centers =Hindu temple= Vaikundapuram Sri Krishna Swami Temple, a Hindu shrine located on the banks of Pamba River with Lord Krishna as the principal deity is the main temple at Thulappally. The annual festival is hosted from 10 May. = Church= St. Thomas Mar Thoma Syrian Church, this is one of the oldest church in the area which belongs to the Syrian Christians.

The hilly terrains here are suitable for its cultivation. Moreover, pepper, banana etc., are also cultivated. Many people works in abroad as well as in urban areas. The 'Malanadu development society' under Kanjirappally diocese has a rural electrification system named \\"Malanadu Mycro Hydel Power Project\\" (MHPP) at Thulappally. This small scale power project generates electricity from water bodies and supplies to about 250 families, shops and pilgrim centers. Climate A tropical climate is normally experienced here. The place receives significant rainfalls during the monsoon, with a short dry season. The average annual temperature rises to 27.3 ¬∞C.

Captain Sinclair discovered Port Denison (the port of Bowen) in 1859 in the cutter Santa Barbara. Exploration During the second half of the nineteenth century the expansion of settlement in North Queensland caused increasing problems with the carriage of freight to and from southern supply centres. In response to this problem the New South Wales Government, in 1859 (i.e. prior to the separation of Queensland), offered a reward for the discovery of a suitable harbour north of Port Curtis (Gladstone) that could be more easily accessed by northern settlers. Captain Henry Daniel Sinclair, owner of the 9-ton ketch Santa Barbara, departed Sydney in August 1859 in order to locate such a suitable harbour, undertook this mission. On 15 October 1859 Sinclair's party found such a site, and subsequently named it Port Denison. However, by the time Sinclair returned to claim his reward, the separation of Queensland had occurred and neither the New South Wales nor Queensland Government each believed the other was responsible for paying the reward and so Sinclair was never paid. The first settlers began arriving as early as 19 March 1861. The settlement was officially proclaimed on 11 April 1861 (after the separation of Queensland), and named Bowen after the Queensland Governor, Sir George Ferguson Bowen. The township of Bowen quickly grew to support the northern pastoral industry as a strategically placed supply centre and over the course of several decades the town developed into a thriving commercial port. Sinclair served as harbourmaster in Bowen for a number of years. Later life In 1868, Sinclair purchased the schooner Telegraph to take up beche-de-mer fishing between Port Denison and Cape York. However, before the vessel was ready to take to sea, Sinclair died aged 50 in a sailing accident in Cleveland Bay (off Townsville) while participating in the St Patrick‚Äôs Day Regatta. He was buried in the West End Cemetery in Townsville on St Patrick's Day with the burial service read by an old friend and shipmate, James Gordon. Sinclair was one of the early burials in the cemetery and his sandstone headstone is believed to be the oldest surviving headstone in the cemetery. He left a widow and five children.  Legacy  On 18 October 1934, a cairn was unveiled in Santa Barbara Park in Bowen, commemorating the 75th anniversary of the landing of Captain Sinclair in Port Denison. On 16 October 2009, the Captain Henry Sinclair monument was unveiled in the Santa Barbara Park in Bowen, commemorating 150 years since Captain Sinclair sailed into Port Denison. It was erected by the Whitsunday Regional Council.

Bass Jr. (January 6, 1927 - April 4, 1998), was an American businessman, coin collector, and philanthropist. He was active in the Texas Republican Party during the late 1950s when the state was still dominated by the Democratic Party. In 1970, Bass and his brother Richard inherited the Goliad Oil and Gas Corporation. Bass invested in ski resorts in Aspen and Vail, Colorado. He was the main developer of the Beaver Creek Resort in Beaver Creek. He also amassed one of the world's great coin collections and served as the president of the American Numismatic Society. Early life Bass was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. His father, Harry W. Bass Sr., was a co-founder of the Goliad Corporation and the Goliad Oil and Gas Corporation in Duncanville, near Dallas, Texas. He had a brother, Richard Bass. Bass was educated at the St. Mark's School of Texas, then known as the Texas Country Day School. He attended Southern Methodist University. During World War II, he served in the South Pacific with the United States Navy. Career Bass started his career in Calgary, Alberta, Canada for his father's oil and gas companies. Bass launched a voter data-collection company and served as the finance chairman of the Republican Party of Dallas County in the late 1950s. The company proved to be a financial failure. He was elected chairman of the Dallas County GOP in 1957, but resigned later that year. By 1960, alongside Republican U.S. Representative Bruce Alger of Texas' 5th congressional district, he staged a demonstration against Democratic U.S. Senator (later President) Lyndon B. Johnson when the latter visited Dallas. He was a delegate to the 1964 Republican National Convention. Bass co-owned H. W. Bass and Sons, a private company headquartered in Dallas. He also invested in the development of ski resorts in Aspen, Colorado, in 1955. Later, he owned 7 percent of the Aspen Ski Corporation with his brother. He invested in the development of Vail and became majority shareholder of Vail Associates, Inc., with 57 percent in 1978. He served as its chairman by 1979. He expanded his holdings to include Beaver Creek Resort. Numismatics and philanthropy Bass began collecting coins in the middle 1960s. He regularly attended coin auctions. By 1976, he had invested \\"millions of dollars\\" in coins. He added that he had 25 per cent of my portfolio in coins,\\" mostly of which were gold coins from the 19th century to 1933. They were held in a trust. He became a member of the American Numismatic Society in 1966. By 1979, he was its president. Bass founded the Harry W. Bass Jr. Research Foundation in 1991. One of its goals was to support numismatics. Personal life Bass married Mary Mathewson in 1947. He later married Doris Wampler Calhoun. Death and legacy Bass died on April 4, 1998 in Dallas and is interred at the Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery. Shortly after his death, the Harry W. Bass Jr. Research Foundation was merged with his late father's philanthropic foundation, the Harry Bass Foundation, to form the Harry W. Bass Jr. Foundation. The endowment comes from oil investments as well as the proceeds from auctions of his coin collection. For example, thirty coins from his collection were auctioned in 2014 in Dallas.

History The score was completed in 1930 and is dedicated to Carlos Ch√°vez . Analysis The quartet is in two movements: #Allegro energico #Vivo The first movement is regarded by one analyst as not following any conventional formal scheme, consisting instead of a series of contrasting episodes in different tempos and frequently changing meters that is similar to the Italian canzonas of the late-sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries . According to another view, it is in a ternary, ABA form, which conflicts with the expected sonata-allegro form of the traditional string quartet . The outer sections are fast, rhythmically irregular, loud, and aggressive, while the middle section contrasts with a slower tempo (Lento), regular rhythms, soft dynamics, and a lyrical, tender mood. The first section falls into four subsections (Allegro energico, Poco meno mosso ‚Äì cantabile, Tempo I, and Meno mosso), each marked at the end by sustained chords, grand pauses, or both. The fourth subsection is a modified repetition of the second. The chromatic harmonies of the slow, B section are reminiscent of the slow passages in the String Quartet and Lyric Suite of Alban Berg. The concluding Allegro is a nearly literal repetition of just the third subsection from the first part of the movement . The second movement is in the same fast-slow-fast ternary pattern as the first, but the two A sections are identical and divided into just two subsections. The slow middle section, unlike its counterpart in the first movement, is characterised by ostinato patterns and an eerie mood. Its metrical regularity contrasts sharply with the erratic rhythms of the outer, A sections . Discography In chronological order of recording. * Cuartetos de cuerda de Silvestre Revueltas.

The score is dedicated to Aurora Murgu√≠a and a performance of it lasts between ten and eleven minutes. History The quartet is the second of four composed in rapid succession in the initial stage of Revueltas's serious turn to composition. It was written in 1931, and is dedicated to Aurora Murgu√≠a, a woman with whom Revueltas had a relationship from 1926 to 1930 . Revueltas also dedicated the contemporaneous score of the first version of Cuauhn√°huac to her. The score was not published during the composer's lifetime, first appearing only in 1953 in an edition by Peer‚ÄìSouthern Music. The printed score differs so greatly from the composer's autograph manuscript that it can only be supposed that it was prepared from a different manuscript version, not presently known to exist . Analysis Agave (maguey) blossoms The quartet is in three movements: The subtitle, Magueyes (the plural form of maguey, also known as the agave, or century plant), is somewhat cryptic. It has been suggested that it may refer to the song of the tlachiquero, a peasant who extracts the juice of the maguey to make the alcoholic drink pulque . Two other suggestions are that the cactus may be a metaphor for a political critique of the Mexican ruling bourgeoisie's strong preference for imported European music over the domestic product, or else a symbol of the expression of a composer's independent and prickly self-confident will to survive a confrontation with the highly demanding genre of the string quartet, along with an urge for nationalist music . However, an even simpler solution (with possible autobiographic allusions) may lie in the fact that, at the very opening of the quartet, Revueltas quotes a famous song of the time, known as \\"Los Magueyes\\". One version of the lyrics begins : :Le pido al cielo que se sequen los magueyes :Porque esos magueyes son causa de mi desgracias; :Soy muy borracho y nada me causa gracia, :Porque no me ama la mujer que tanto am√©. I pray to heaven to dry up the magueys, Because these agaves are the cause of my misfortune; I am very drunk and nothing gives me satisfaction, Because the woman I loved so much does not love me. The first movement is in four sections displaying an ABA‚Ä≤B‚Ä≤ binary-form pattern, which alternatively can be described as a sonata form without a development . The second movement is divided into three sections, in a fast-slow-fast relationship. The central, slow section quotes a lento interpolation found in the first movement . In fact, most of the motivic material in this \\"angry scherzo\\" is held in common with the first movement . The concluding movement is very short, only thirty- seven bars. It opens with a brief subject in quintuple meter, presented in stretto imitations, and continues in a busy and noisy fashion to the end . The characteristic staggered rhythms of the beginning are gradually brought together into unison rhythms over the course of the movement . Discography * Cuartetos de cuerda de Silvestre Revueltas.

It is a many-branched shrub with its branches, leaves and sepals densely-covered with a thick layer of greyish or yellowish hairs giving the plant a felty appearance. Its flowers are cream-coloured to pink and are spotted or streaked dark red. It occurs mostly in Western Australia but also in the far west of South Australia and the Northern Territory. Six subspecies are recognised by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Description Eremophila forrestii is an erect, many-branched shrub growing to a height of between . The branches and leaves are covered with a thick, dense layer of branched, greyish or bright lemon-yellow hairs making them felty. The leaves vary in shape, depending on subspecies, from lance-shaped to almost circular and are mostly long and wide. The flowers are usually borne singly in leaf axils on a stalk, long and covered with a similar layer of hairs to those on the leaves. The 5 sepals are lance-shaped to egg-shaped, covered with a felty layer of hairs and mostly long. The petals are mostly long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is cream to pink, spotted or streaked with dark red on the inside of the petal lobes and the upper park of the petal tube. The tube is covered on both surfaces with glandular hairs and the hairs inside the tube are long. The 4 stamens extend beyond the end of the petal tube. Flowering occurs from April to October and is followed by fruits which are dry, oval-shaped to almost spherical, long and which have a papery covering.E. forrestii forrestii (narrow sepals)E. forrestii hastieana (broad sepals) Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1869 by Ferdinand von Mueller and the description was published in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. The specific epithet (forrestii) honours the Australian explorer, politician and plant collector John Forrest. Five subspecies are recognised by the Australian Plant Census and the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife as at April 2020: *Eremophila forrestii subsp. capensis Chinnock (commonly known as Cape Range poverty bush) has its leaves and branches densely covered with grey or yellow hairs hiding the green surface beneath, leaves that are thickened and widely elliptic to almost round; *Eremophila forrestii F.Muell. subsp. forrestii has its leaves and branches densely covered with grey or yellow hairs hiding the green surface beneath, leaves that are not thickened and sepals that are lance-shaped; *Eremophila forrestii subsp. hastieana (W.Fitzg.) Chinnock has its leaves and branches densely covered with grey or yellow hairs hiding the green surface beneath, leaves that are not thickened and sepals that are egg-shaped; *Eremophila forrestii subsp. inland (A.A. Mitchell PRP 1175) is similar to subspecies forrestii except that its new leaves are yellow and the flowers are pale white to pink with prominent blotches inside; *Eremophila forrestii subsp. viridis Chinnock has leaves and branches with scattered glandular or branched hairs. Distribution and habitat Eremophila forrestii subspecies forestii is widespread and common from the west coast of Western Australia to the extreme south west of the Northern Territory and the extreme north east of South Australia between the latitudes of 21¬∞S and 30¬∞S. In Western Australia it is found in the Eremaean and South West botanical provinces. It grows in a wide range of habitats but is most common between sand dunes and on sand plains. Subspecies capensis is restricted to the Cape Range National Park in the Carnarvon biogeographic region where it grows in rocky limestone. Subspecies hastieana is common between Leonora and Nanutarra and areas to the east of those localities in the Carnarvon, Gascoyne, Murchison, Pilbara and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. It usually grows in mulga woodland, usually on red-brown clay or on stony flats. Subspecies viridis, a little known subspecies, is found near Onslow, Neale Junction and Well 38 on the Canning Stock Route. Subspecies \\"inland\\" is common and widespread from east of Warburton to Tom Price in the Gascoyne and Gibson Desert biogeographic regions where it grows in sand dunes and sandplains. Conservation status Subspecies forrestii, hastieana and \\"inland\\" are classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Subspecies capensis, viridis and \\"inland\\" are classified as \\"Priority Three\\" meaning that they are poorly known and known from only a few locations but are not under imminent threat. Uses=Agriculture= Wilcox bush is sometimes useful as forage for sheep but not for cattle. Its presence or absence can be an indication of the quality of pasture. =Horticulture= This eremophila is very common in Western Australia but has rarely been grown in gardens although it has been grown in Victoria and South Australia. It is difficult to propagate but easiest by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock. It grows best in well-drained soil in either a sunny or partially shaded position and most forms are drought and frost tolerant.

A notable exception was Madelyn Pugh, who wrote for the I Love Lucy series. After the success of Treva Silverman, some showrunners began to actively recruit women writers. One of them was James L. Brooks who hired Brown to write an episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. When Brooks created Rhoda, a spin-off of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Brown was hired as a staff writer. In 1975, she received a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for writing an episode for the series. She quickly rose up the ranks, becoming the program's executive producer in 1977.

It was designed by George David Payne and built from 1900 to 1902 by Crawford & Cameron. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005.  History  The former Townsville Customs House, the fourth customs building in Townsville, was constructed in 1901/02 to a design prepared in 1899/1900 by architect George Payne of the Government Architect's Office in the Queensland Department of Public Works. Townsville had been established in the mid-1860s by pastoralist John Melton Black and his Sydney business partner, Robert Towns, as a port to service Woodstock Station. There were already ports at Bowen and Cardwell but during the wet season Woodstock and other stations to the west were often cut off from these centres by floodwaters. In November 1864 Black's employees Andrew Ball and Mark Reid set up camp close to the mouth of Ross Creek on Cleveland Bay and in the next few months Black and Towns invested in the construction of a warehouse and wharf. A residence was constructed for Melton Black on Melton Hill overlooking the fledgling port. At this period Robert Towns, with interests in banking, pastoral, shipping and commercial industries, was one of Australian's most influential businessmen. Having invested heavily in the early establishment of this new Queensland port facility, Black and Towns lobbied the colonial government to declare the new township a port of entry. They received support from the Queensland Collector of Customs and on 17 June 1865 Cleveland Bay was proclaimed a \\"Port of Entry and Clearance\\". At that time a small Customs service was established in the township. Staff included the Sub-Collector of Customs who, for an annual fee of 300, served as the Police Magistrate, Clerk of Petty Sessions, and Harbour and Port Master. Two staff were employed as customs and harbour workers, boatmen and constables. The construction of a bond store and customs warehouse was also authorised at that time. On 29 July 1865 the Surveyor-General's Department decided that the new Customs House should be located next to the harbour entrance on Ross Creek. A town survey had been completed and the first land sales took place on 31 July 1865. On 6 September 1865 the Queensland Executive Council, referring for the first time to the township as \\"Townsville\\", approved a block of land bounded by the Strand and Flinders Street as an appropriate site for the Customs Reserve and new Customs House. It was in an elevated position and commanded an excellent view of the harbour. Early in 1866 the Municipality of Townsville was declared with Black elected as Mayor. In October 1866 the Province of Townsville was declared, covering a large area centred round Townsville. The discovery of gold at Cape River in 1867 and Ravenswood in 1869 stimulated the development of Townsville as a port and administration centre. By 1870 a new building had been constructed to house customs and court functions and a wharf built on the Customs Reserve on Ross Creek. The new building was a cramped, three-roomed wooden structure. Early in 1871 an additional two offices were added at the rear of the building. To create more space the Sub-Collector of Customs suggested that a bond store be built, which was constructed in July 1872 on the Customs Reserve close to the wharf facing Flinders Street. In March 1874 the Sub-Collector of Customs further suggested that the Court House facilities be removed from the Customs building and in February 1875 approval was given for a new court house, which was constructed in 1876 in Sturt Street. The Customs Service grew rapidly as road and rail networks in the Townsville hinterland expanded to meet the needs of the pastoral industry and gold fields. By the late 1870s the early timber framed government buildings in Townsville were beginning to be replaced by ore substantial structures. The new, more imposing buildings reflected the growing prosperity of the region. In 1884 the Customs Bond Store on the bank of Ross Creek was extended. In 1889 the importance of the Customs Service was demonstrated with the opening of the new Brisbane Customs House. By September 1891 the inadequacy of the Townsville office was obvious and the decision was made to convert the former Post and Telegraph Office into a customs house. This work was completed by June 1892. At this stage the quarters of the Sub-Collector of Customs comprised a timber structure at the rear of the Supreme Court. By 1898 the Customs Service had again outgrown its building. At the same time the Queensland government embarked on an ambitious building program to make a generous contribution to the planned Commonwealth of Australia by constructing new customs houses or upgrading existing ones prior to Federation. Included in the building program were new customs houses at Rockhampton (1898-1901), Townsville (1898-1902), Bundaberg (completed ) and Mackay (completed in 1902) and an upgrading of the 1870 Maryborough Customs House in 1900. Townsville Customs and Estate Agent JN Parkes, commissioned to find a suitable site for a new Townsville customs house, recommended two blocks bounded by The Strand, Wickham and Cunningham Streets. The site, owned by the Bank of New South Wales, was purchased by the Queensland government in November 1898 for ¬£1600. Plans were prepared in 1899 by architect George Payne employed temporarily in the Government Architect's Office. The plans were approved by the government in January 1900, just prior to Federation and the creation of the new Australian Customs Services. George Payne was a London born and trained architect who arrived in New South Wales . In the late 1880s he achieved success in a number of design competitions and in the early 1890s established his own architectural practice in Sydney. He was a foundation member of the Sydney Architectural Association and in 1891-93 its inaugural vice-president. Due to the effects of the economic depression of the 1890s on the architectural profession, Payne gained a temporary position as a draftsman in the Queensland Public Works Department, taking up the appointment in March 1898. It has been suggested that Payne may have been the catalyst for the sophistication of the subsequent work of the Department's Professional Branch. He prepared working drawings for the Rockhampton Customs House, in which he likely contributed to the design detailing and in 1899 designed and documented the Townsville Customs House. With the tropical climate and the government's desire to impress in mind, he designed a colonnaded Romanesque building with an imposing presence to The Strand and shaded, well ventilated interiors. In late 1902 Payne resigned from the Public Works Department to oversee construction of his winning design for St Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Brisbane, for which he acquired a national reputation. Payne's Townsville Customs House was a brick and stone building of generous design, with high ceilings to allow for maximum air circulation and broad, colonnaded verandahs to provide shade for the internal rooms. While no plans of previous Townsville Customs buildings have been located it is probable that this building provided, for the first time, the traditional arrangement of Customs Service rooms, based on the British tradition of a lofty and impressive \\"long room\\" for the reception of the public. It appears to have included residential accommodation for the Sub-Collector of Customs on the upper floor and a basement. As with other Queensland customs buildings designed at this period, the Townsville Customs House, through its architectural distinction, was designed to impress and to present the Customs Service as a crucial arm of government. Tenders were called in February 1900 and the tender of ¬£26,642, submitted by Messrs Crawford and Cameron of Kangaroo Point, Brisbane was accepted on 7 March 1900. The works supervisor was ES Hunt. The building was constructed of brick and stone with concrete foundations and a plinth of granite from Cockle Bay on Magnetic Island. The use of local labour and materials was intended to stimulate local industry. However, it is thought that the stone dressings (sandstone colonnade, balustrade rails and bases) came from Stanwell near Rockhampton. Construction was completed in late 1902. Following the federation of the Australian colonies as the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901, the new federal government assumed responsibility for the fixing and collection of customs duties on goods entering Australia. Customs duties imposed on inter-colonial trade were abolished. The operation of existing coastal customs houses and the establishment of new ones became a Commonwealth function. Under the new arrangements, the Commonwealth assumed control of Queensland's existing customs houses. By December 1908 the Townsville Customs House, valued at ¬£32,201 (¬£27,261 for the structure and ¬£4,940 for the site), had been transferred to the Commonwealth. The building was severely damaged by Cyclone Leonta in March 1903 when two chimneys fell and crashed through the roof into an office below. Despite repairs the roof began to leak and in 1910 the tiles were replaced with galvanised iron pan tiles. The tiles on the portico turret roof were left in situ until 1938 when leaks developed and the whole roof was replaced with galvanised steel. Besides the Commonwealth Customs Service, the building also accommodated a number of Queensland government agencies, including the Stamps and Titles Office (), Department of Works, the Bankruptcy Branch and the Electoral Office. During the second world war the Commonwealth Department of Works and Buildings expanded and in 1943 constructed a temporary, two storeyed building in the southwest corner of the grounds. The balcony above the Long Room became office space and a temporary wooden mezzanine floor was erected in the Long Room. Part of the first floor residence became office space for the Department of Works and Buildings and the basement was converted into an air raid shelter with an exit door to Wickham Street. During the war years Works and Buildings was responsible for the construction of war facilities across north Queensland. The department constructed military facilities as well as converting private property to military use and continued to operate from the Customs House until the 1980s. The roof was damaged again in 1971 by Cyclone Althea, following which the domed roof was reclad with galvanised steel and the turret roof with zinc in 1973. By 1973 other government departments were again occupying the building including the Department of Works, the Department of Primary Industry and the Department of the Navy. In 1978 the building was entered on the Register of the National Estate. Restoration work in 1983 won a John Herbert Award for Meritorious Conservation Action. This work included a new roof of specially formed painted steel to the original 1910 profile and gutters replaced to match the original ogee profile. The flat at the west end was vacated and verandah enclosures removed, with restoration of the stone and brick work on the balcony. The building was painted and exterior masonry was dressed and re-pointed. In 1992 $620,000 was allocated by the Federal government for the restoration and conservation of the building, including the repair of the sandstone, masonry and roof sheeting. The place is no longer owned by the Commonwealth.  Description  The Townsville Customs House is located on the corner of The Strand and Wickham Street, at the base of Melton Hill overlooking Cleveland Bay. It is one of a number of buildings at the eastern end of the city which are of cultural heritage significance. The building is a two-storeyed, L shaped, red brick building with an elaborate semi-circular corner entrance. Verandahs exist on both levels on both street elevations, with iron balustrading on the ground floor. There is a tower on the Strand side, which has a lookout for the observation of shipping. The roof is roll and cap iron. The ground floor interior includes the Long Room which contains the public counter and work area; a communications room; several general offices; two store rooms; an entrance hall, main stairs and lobby; colonnades; a safe; clearing office; strong room; amenities room; field store; and a flat containing a bedroom, bathroom, balcony and portion of the colonnade. The first floor contains the Sub-Collector of Customs living area. Within this area are three bedrooms created using modern partitioning, a living room, lounge, kitchen, and colonnades on both the north and south facades, which contain laundry and bathroom facilities. There is also a lobby into the living area (former Titles Office), a staircase lobby, a gallery over the Long Room, a pantry and store. The surviving internal timber work and timber fittings are of cedar. There are a number of tiled fireplaces throughout the main offices. There are leadlight windows in the original dome. The cedar and plaster mouldings of the dome are also intact.  Heritage listing  Townsville Customs House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 February 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Townsville Customs House, completed in 1902, was commissioned by the Queensland government prior to Federation during the period of planning for the hand over of government departments and their facilities to the new federal government. Purpose-built as a customs house, the building was used by the Australian Customs Service for close to a century. It is significant historically as an expression of the importance of the customs service to Queensland and to Australia. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Townsville Customs House is an elegant, imposing brick building with sandstone detailing. It remains substantially intact and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its class of place, being one of a group of imposing, two-storeyed brick and stone customs houses designed by the Queensland Public Works department and constructed around the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. It is important in illustrating the best work of the office of the Queensland Government Architect and in particular the work of respected architect George Payne. The former Townsville Customs House provides important evidence of adaptation to the climatic requirements of north Queensland particularly in its high ceilings and wide colonnades along the length of both street elevations. It possesses a strong, visual unity in its use of scale, materials and texture and has architectural significance on a national scale. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. With its distinctive entrance portico and domed roof the former Townsville Customs House makes an outstanding contribution to an historic and aesthetic streetscape that includes Anzac Memorial Park, the former Queen's Hotel, the State Government Offices, Tattersalls Hotel, and the former Bank of New South Wales. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place has a special association with the work in Townsville and north Queensland of the Queensland and Australian customs services for close to a century.

It was first built in 1912. It is also known as The Strand Park and Townsville War Memorial. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Anzac Memorial Park was established as The Strand Park in the 1910s, but the foreshore along The Strand (Townsville's main frontage to Cleveland Bay) had developed as a recreation area from the 1860s, the earliest days of settlement. The whole of the foreshore between King and Howitt Streets was gazetted a temporary reserve for public purposes in February 1901, and a section of this, between the Customs House and King Street, was proclaimed a permanent reserve for park purposes in June 1912. As early as 1866, Townsville's more affluent residents were constructing homes along the beachfront, and by 1872, three hotels had been erected opposite the present Anzac Memorial Park. The Strand was unformed at this time, being little more than a track along the foreshore, and there were no shade trees, but the beach was popular with bathers (mainly male) from at least the late 1870s. In 1881 the town council planted 30 cedar trees along the foreshore, and added cocoa and betel nut trees in early 1882. In 1883, following strong public demand, a road was made along the beach front to Kissing Point. By 1889, The Strand, between King Street and Kissing Point, made a glorious promenade on a moonlight night when the breeze blew straight and cool from Magnetic Island. Photographs of The Strand in 1888 show banyan trees several years old, as well as more recent plantings, and a reserve for public baths (opposite the then quarry site on The Strand) was gazetted in 1889. One of the earliest structures erected along the foreshore was an ornamental fountain/bird-bath, extant by 1905, which remained in the park reserve to the 1950s at least. In 1908 a drinking fountain was constructed opposite Queen's Hotel, near the corner of Wickham Street and The Strand. It was located outside the park proper, on the road verge, and was erected as a memorial to William Joseph Castling, a butcher and former Mayor of Townsville. This drinking fountain was moved to the western end of the park, probably during road works after 1924. One of the principal instigators of the establishment of a formal park along The Strand was John Henry Tyack, owner of Queen's Hotel 1899‚Äì1913, alderman in the Townsville City Council 1906‚Äì13, and mayor of Townsville in 1912. He had commissioned the elaborate re-building of Queen's Hotel, one of the few grand hotels of Northern Queensland, starting in 1902‚Äì04, and took an interest in beautifying the foreshore opposite. In April 1912, during Tyack's term as mayor, Townsville City Council applied to have the foreshore along The Strand, from the sea baths to King Street, gazetted as The Strand Park. The Council had already spent a considerable amount of money on foreshore improvements, and intended to spend more. In June, about were proclaimed a permanent reserve for park purposes, extending from King Street to Cleveland Street. As early as 1901, Council had considered erecting a new bandstand on the beach, but this project did not eventuate until 1913. Through Henry Tyack's efforts, a public subscription was raised for the construction of a small, ornate bandstand in the park. The structure was designed by Sydney architect Arthur Beckford Polin , who had designed the new Queen's Hotel for Tyack , when resident in Townsville as the North Queensland representative of the architectural firm of Eaton, Bates and Polin. J Crase & Co., ironworkers and brass founders of Brisbane, supplied the cast iron scroll work and pillars for the bandstand, in the same design as that used on the Queen's Hotel, and construction was carried out by municipal employees. The bandstand was nearing completion when Tyack died on 28 July 1913, and it was dedicated in Tyack's memory on 27 September, by Alderman Robert Wilson McClelland, Mayor of Townsville. The stand was intended to cater for both band and vocal concerts, mainly during the summer months. Initially, the bandstand was located opposite the main entrance gates to the park. It was relocated to the eastern end of the park when the Queensland Centenary Fountain was constructed on the same site in 1959. In 1914‚Äì15, a bowling green and clubhouse were constructed on land at the southern end of The Strand Park, the land being leased by the newly established Townsville Bowls Club from the City Council. The first clubhouse was destroyed during Cyclone Althea in December 1971, the grass was replaced with an artificial green in 1992, and in 1994 the land occupied by the bowls club was excised from the park (and does not form part of the park's heritage listing). Anzac Memorial Park and Esplanade, Townsville, circa 1935 From at least the 1920s, The Strand Park was a focus for Anzac Day ceremonies. In 1923‚Äì24 a memorial clocktower was erected in the park, to the west of the bandstand. The memorial was financed by public subscription, and was designed and constructed by monumental masons Melrose and Fenwick of Townsville. The design had been finalised by September 1923, and the monument was completed by Anzac Day 1924, when it was unveiled and dedicated by the Governor of Queensland, Sir Matthew Nathan. When first established, a picket fence divided the park from the roadway. By 1924, that section of the timber fence opposite Queen's Hotel, near the intersection of Wickham Street and The Strand, had been replaced with park entrance gates and fencing of wrought-iron panels set between masonry pillars. Also by 1924, several canon, probably trophies from the 1914‚Äì18 war, were located east and west of the bandstand; the park was lit by gas lamps; and a children's playground had been constructed at the western end of the park, near the sea baths. No evidence of this early playground survives. In October 1925, the park was described as being tastefully laid out and planted with ornamental trees, shrubs with foliage of variegated colours, and lawns of couch grass, and attracted hundreds of people to the Sunday evening band and orchestral concerts. In the 1920s, the park was considered a tourist attraction, and was extended to over in July 1926, by including the land up to the sea baths reserve. Early in 1934, the name was changed to Anzac Memorial Park, and a metal arch bearing the new name was erected above the entrance gates, in time for the April 25 Anzac Day commemorations. In April 1953, Anzac Memorial Park was extended to , and in 1959 the bandstand was relocated within the park to permit construction in its place of a fountain to commemorate the centenary of Queensland's separation from New South Wales. In December 1971, Cyclone Althea caused substantial damage to the park. Many of the 1880s trees were destroyed and others stripped of their leaves. Subsequently, the Townsville City Council erected a plaque in the park, to commemorate the role of the Australian Army in the restoration of Townsville after the cyclone. Prior to the Battle of the Coral Sea Commemorations in 1992, the gardens in Anzac memorial Park were replanted and most of the memorial structures were cleaned and/or repainted. A large Coral Sea Battle Memorial was built to the north of the Centenary Fountain. The memorial commemorates the role of Australian and American servicemen in the Battle of the Coral Sea in 1942. About the same period, a new children's play area was created between the bandstand and the Centenary Fountain.  Description  Anzac Memorial Park extends along the foreshore overlooking Cleveland Bay, with views to Magnetic Island. It is bordered to the west by Tobruk Memorial Baths, to the south by The Strand, to the east by the Townsville Bowls Club, and to the north by reclaimed land forming part of a recent marina development. The park is surrounded by a low concrete edging with obelisk-like pillars at regular intervals. Steel chains stretch between the pillars along the sea front (to the north) only. There are mature Banyan trees along The Strand boundary, just outside the park reserve, and early garden beds along the street and throughout the park. More recently planted palm trees are scattered throughout the park. Anzac Memorial Park forms a garden setting for a number of adjacent buildings of cultural heritage significance, including the former Queen's Hotel and former Customs House along The Strand, further up on Wickham Street, the State Government Offices and at the corner of Cleveland Terrace and Melton Terrace, the former Supreme Court Building. Anzac Memorial Park contains a number of memorial structures. The memorial Bandstand is centrally placed at the eastern end of the park. West of this are newly established gardens and a recent children's playground. In the centre of the park, opposite the main entrance gates to The Strand and Wickham Street, is the 1959 Queensland Centenary Fountain. To the north of the Fountain is a 1992 memorial to the Battle of the Coral Sea. The entrance gates, Fountain and Coral Sea Memorial form a north-south axis which bisects the park. West of the fountain is the First World War Memorial, also centrally located. At the western end of the park is the WJ Castling Memorial, again, centrally positioned. The WJ Castling Memorial, First World War Memorial, Queensland Centenary Fountain, and the Bandstand, form an axis east-west, and each is set in a paved surround within the grassed area of the park's centre. = W J Castling Memorial, 1908 = The W J Castling memorial drinking fountain is an exercise in the use of classical elements, based on a simple square form plan with an attic storey raised on Ionic columns. The structure derives from the Roman triumphal arch, with its four columns standing on pedestals and rising to an entablature, above which is the attic storey with a semicircular decorative motif. The arches have been displaced by the capitals, and occur within the structure as a shallow dome above the central urn on its octagonal base. The curves of a basilica roof are reduced to a convex pyramidal form, topped with a decorative carved finial. Carved of yellow sandstone, the columns, roof and urn are supported on a plinth and attached column bases of white marble. A basin has been formed in marble on each side of the drinking fountain. = Bandstand, 1913 = The bandstand is also an exercise in the language of classical architecture, using a simple square form plan with a pyramidal roof raised on composite order columns. The Mannerist composition of the screen derives from the Renaissance illustrations of the classical orders, in which the elements of the entablature surmounting the capital are interpreted as panels of open space between flat pilasters. The frieze band of the entablature is infilled with decorative cast iron panels, framed between chamfered square section timber posts and visually supported on corner brackets to the underside of the taenia, or plate that separates the frieze from the architrave below. Panels of decorative cast iron are fixed between columns to form a continuous balustrade, broken only at the top of the steps where it meets round iron posts with ball finials. Paired columns at each corner are infilled with frieze panels above and balustrading below, with curved corner brackets at each junction to form an egg-shaped opening in the screen. Columns are set on a base of rendered brickwork, set one metre above the surrounding garden beds with rendered steps and curved strings. Within the bandstand is a recent hardwood boarded floor, and a flat VJ lined ceiling extending beyond the screen of the walls to form boxed eaves stopped at a deep timber fascia. The roof is sheeted in corrugated galvanised iron, and has a turned timber finial. The structure is finished in a green plastic paint except for the floorboards which are unpainted and the ceiling and finial which are painted off-white. There is no guttering nor rainwater goods, and the original interior light fitting is missing. = First World War Memorial, 1923‚Äì24 = This memorial is a column of rough cut, rusticated grey granite supported on a red-white marble plinth and bracketed by three white marble fins each supported by triple columns on attached bases. The column is finished with a projecting abacus of granite, and is supported on a concrete stylobate of two steps, surfaced in red granite chips. White marble tablets are fixed to the column between the fins, and high on the column's four faces are inset circular bronze plaques, each sheltered by a narrow bracketed shelf of white marble. The four plaques depict an eagle, crossed swords, anchor, and the seal of the City of Townsville, and replace four clock faces. = Queensland Centenary Fountain, 1959 = This is a circular fountain approximately high with central sprays. It sits in a shallow pool fed by perimeter sprays set in a low masonry ring. = Battle of the Coral Sea Memorial, 1992 = Earth is banked in a glacis against two low, outward- sloping walls that form two facing quadrants around a circular paved area. The walls rise in an arc to a height of about one metre in their centre, and are finished in red granite. The lettering and illustrations that tell the story of the Battle of the Coral Sea are picked out in contrasting rough and smooth finishes on the surfaces of the walls. Within the paved area are two truncated columns, bearing bronze information plaques.  Heritage listing  Anzac Memorial Park was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Since the early 20th century, the park has provided a community focus for commemorative activities, and contains a number of memorials to events or persons of significance in Townsville's history, including the WJ Castling Memorial (1908), the Bandstand (1913), the First World War Memorial (1923‚Äì24), the Queensland Centenary Fountain (1959) and the Battle of the Coral Sea Memorial (1992). The First World War Memorial is a member of a class of commemorative structures erected as a record of the local impact of a major historical event and intended to endure, and along with the renaming of the park as Anzac Memorial Park, survives as evidence of a widespread social movement expressing Australian patriotism and nationalism in the interwar period. The Queensland Centenary Fountain is significant as Townsville City Council's major contribution to the celebration of the centenary of Queensland's separation from New South Wales in 1859. The adjacent mature Banyan trees are significant as some of the earliest surviving street plantings in Townsville. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The WJ Castling Memorial and the Bandstand are finely detailed, classically derived structures that reflect the Mannerism of the Victorian and Edwardian Periods and the tradition of constructing public buildings in a classical style. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The bandstand in particular is an aesthetically pleasing and skilfully executed composition based on the language of classical architecture. Furthermore, the principal original elements of the composition are intact. The WJ Castling Memorial is significant for its craftsmanship and intactness. The First World War Memorial is a dominant structure in Anzac Park, and in its aesthetic quality and craftsmanship, makes a significant contribution to the townscape quality of the park. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The establishment of the park was closely connected with civic leader and publican John Henry Tyack and the re- development of the Queens Hotel opposite, and for the first half of the 20th century, remained one of Townsville's principal tourist attractions. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Anzac Memorial Park are important for their association with The Strand and Cleveland Bay foreshore as one of the earliest recreation venues in Townsville. Since the early 20th century, the park has provided a community focus for commemorative activities, and contains a number of memorials to events or persons of significance in Townsville's history, including the WJ Castling Memorial (1908), the Bandstand (1913), the First World War Memorial (1923‚Äì24), the Queensland Centenary Fountain (1959) and the Battle of the Coral Sea Memorial (1992).

She was known as \\"Australia's Little Miss Sweetheart\\". Early life Batley was born in Sydney on Christmas Day, 1944, and began singing at the age of five with her mother's encouragement. As a child, she sang on radio shows such as 2UE's Youth Parade, 2UW's Amateur Hour and the ABC's Rockville Junction. She entered numerous talent competitions, and eventually won her first recording contract, with Festival Records, in 1960 as a prize in a singing competition. Career Batley's first record \\"Starry Eyed\\" was released in February 1960, but was not a success. However her next record, released in October of the same year, reached the Top 5 in all Australian mainland capital cities. It was a recording of Barefoot Boy, a song written by the then 16-year-old Helene Grover. It remained in the charts for sixteen weeks. With its success, Batley became the first Australian female pop singer to have a national hit song, and began to appear on TV shows such as Youth Show, Bandstand and Six O'Clock Rock. In 1961, Batley was voted Australia's Top Female Singer. Her mother became her manager and together they completed a two-week tour of New Zealand in 1964. She continued to record for Festival until 1969, when she went on a tour of Europe and England. She eventually settled in England, in 1970, and continued to perform there. Her last recording, Seabird, was released in 1972. Later life Batley married in 1975 and had a child in 1976. The family lived first in Essex, England, and then in Miami, Florida.

Multiple- scale integrated assessment of societal metabolism: an analytical tool to study development and sustainability. Environment, Development and Sustainability 3 (4): 275-307. is a method of accounting used to analyse socio-ecosystems and to simulate possible patterns of development. It is based on maintaining coherence across scales and different dimensions (e.g. economic, demographic, energetic) of quantitative assessments generated using different metrics. It is designed to detect and analyze patterns in the societal use of resources making a distinction between: # the internal end uses (who is using which resources, how much, how, and why); # the resulting internal environmental pressures associated with the various end uses, allowing an analysis of the impacts they create on the environment; and # the level of externalization through trade of both requirements of additional end uses and resulting environmental pressures that are moved to the social- ecological systems producing the imports. The ability to integrate quantitative assessments across dimensions and scales makes MuSIASEM particularly suited for different types of sustainability analysis: the nexus between food, energy, water and land uses; urban metabolism; waste metabolism; tourism metabolism; and rural development. History The approach was created around 1997 by Mario Giampietro and Kozo Mayumi,Giampietro, M. and Mayumi, K. 1997. A relational model of socioeconomic systems based on hierarchy theory and its application to sustainability. Structural Change and Economic Dynamics 8, 453-469. and has been developed since then by the members of the IASTE (Integrated Assessment: Sociology, Technology and the Environment) group at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology of the Autonomous University of Barcelona and its external collaborators. The purpose of MuSIASEM is to characterize metabolic patterns of socio-ecological systems (how and why humans use resources and how this use depends on and affects the stability of the ecosystems embedding the society). This integrated approach allows for a quantitative implementation of the DPSIR framework (Drivers, Pressures, States, Impacts and Responses) and application as a decision support tool. Different alternatives of the option space can be checked in terms of feasibility (compatibility with processes outside human control), viability (compatibility with processes under human control) and desirability (compatibility with normative values and institutions). The original version of the accounting scheme has been improved using theoretical concepts from complex systems theory leading to the generation of MuSIASEM version 2.0, tested in several case studies.

Originally established as Attack Squadron 156 (VA-156) on 4 June 1956, it was redesignated VF-111 on 20 January 1959, the day after the original VF-111 was disestablished. The squadron was redesignated VF-26 on 1 September 1964, redesignated as VF-111 on 17 September 1964 and disestablished on 31 March 1995. History F11F-1 Tiger 3 distinct Navy squadrons have called themselves ‚ÄòSundowners‚Äô. The U.S. Navy frequently has given the same designation to two or more aviation units, leading to lasting confusion. Officially, the US Navy does not recognize a direct lineage with disestablished squadrons if a new squadron is formed with the same designation. Often, the new squadron will assume the nickname, insignia, and traditions of the earlier squadrons. In November 2006, VFC-13 Detachment Key West was redesignated as VFC-111, taking on the 'Sundowner' insignia and callsign. VA-156, originally known as the Iron Tigers, was established on 4 June 1956 and flew the F11F-1 Tiger. VA-156 was assigned to CVW-11 and made a single deployment aboard to the Western Pacific. =1960s= In 1961 the Sundowners' traditional mascot, \\"Omar,\\" was conceived by squadron enlisted men to mark the transition to the F-8D Crusader. The triangular stick figure appeared on VF-111 aircraft and squadron spaces. During the 1960s, VF-111 flew four different versions of the Crusader (F-8C/D/E/H). =Vietnam War= F-8D attacks ground targets in South Vietnam in 1965 VF-111 Det.11 Omar's Orphans F-8C landing on in 1967 F-4B bombing over Vietnam in 1971 During the Vietnam War the Sundowners were based at NAS Miramar, California with the squadron (including detachments) making ten deployments to Southeast Asia, flying 12,500 combat sorties.

Nominally an anti-submarine carrier in the Atlantic Fleet, USS Intrepid made three deployments with CVW-10 to Vietnam as an attack carrier. On 12 August F-8C BuNo 146993 was shot down, the pilot was rescued from the sea. On 26 October, three members of the squadron were killed in the USS Oriskany fire. From 16 June 1967 to 31 January 1968, VF-111 equipped with F-8Cs was deployed on USS Oriskany.

On 19 September, Lieutenant Tony Nargi shot down a Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF) MiG-21 with an AIM-9 Sidewinder. From 1 February to 18 September 1969, VF-111 equipped with F-8Hs was deployed aboard . On 6 July, F-8H BuNo 148636 was lost due to engine failure, the pilot ejected successfully and was rescued. From 5 March to 17 December 1970, VF-111 was deployed aboard . VF-111 had the highest combat loss rate of the F-8 fighter units deployed to Vietnam. From 12 November 1971 to 17 July 1972, VF-111 equipped with F-4Bs was deployed on . On 6 March 1972, LT Garry Weigand and LTJG Bill Freckleton engaged and shot down a VPAF MiG-17 near Quang Lang Airfield in North Vietnam. Their aircraft, F-4B, NL 201, BuNo 153019, was restored to the original paint scheme by the current Sundowner squadron, VFC-111, and is displayed on a pedestal just inside the main gate at NAS Key West, Florida. From 9 March to 8 November 1973, VF-111 was deployed on USS Coral Sea. =1970s= In 1971, VF-111 joined CVW-15 and transitioned to the F-4B. The squadron later transitioned to the F-4N version of the Phantom, but was scheduled to turn these in for the F-4J. In 1975, both VF-51 and VF-111 received six F-4Js but, due to operational considerations regarding their next deployment, the two units reverted to the \\"N\\" model. In late 1976 through early 1977, VF-111 made an Atlantic and Mediterranean deployment, a rare event for a Pacific Fleet squadron, with CVW-19 aboard for that carrier's final cruise. The squadron returned to NAS Miramar in April 1977 and began transition to the F-14A Tomcat. By October 1978, VF-111 had fully transitioned to the Block 100 model F-14A. VF-111 subsequently deployed with CVW-15 aboard USS Kitty Hawk from May 1979 to February 1980, a deployment which was extended from its originally planned end date in early December 1979 due to the November 1979 seizure of the American Embassy in Teheran, Iran. During this period, the squadron operated from the USS Kitty Hawk in the Indian Ocean south of the Iranian coast until relieved by and the squadrons of CVW-8. =1980s= In addition to its \\"extended\\" deployment during the first two months of 1980, VF-111 deployed a final time on USS Kitty Hawk from April to October 1981. In October 1983, VF-111 returned to its home station of NAS Miramar following a world cruise with CVW-15 on the maiden deployment of . In the spring of 1986 VF-111 began another work-up cycle, completing a series of training evolution and exercises in preparation for their June 1988 Pacific/Indian Ocean deployment. VF-111's seventeen month work-up was capped by FLEETEX 88-2, the first time since World War II that a carrier, USS Carl Vinson and a battleship, the operated as a combined Battle Fleet. VF-111's 1988 deployment began in June and ended in December. It included operations in the Northern/Western Pacific, Arabian Sea, and Indian Ocean, providing support of tanker escorts in the Persian Gulf and included a transit of the Bering Sea, the fourth such transit in four deployments. In preparation for deployment in 1990, VF-111 deployed aboard USS Carl Vinson from September to November 1989 as participants in PACEX 89. This exercise had the Sundowners operating in the Bering Sea, the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Japan as a part of the largest naval exercise since World War II. =1990s= F-14A launching a Phoenix missile, 1991. The Sundowners next deployed from February to July 1990. VF-111 received the 1990 Boola Boola award for success in exercise missile firings, as well as the 1990 Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS) derby, awarded to the best tactical air reconnaissance squadron on the West Coast. On 15 October 1991, VF-111 returned to USS Kitty Hawk for her two- month cruise from NAS Norfolk, Virginia \\"around the horn\\" of South America to NAS North Island, California following the carrier's comprehensive, multi-year Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Multi- national exercises with Venezuela, Argentina and Chile were conducted in various air-to-air and strike scenarios. The Sundowners returned to NAS Miramar in December 1991. In 1993, VF-111 deployed to the Pacific, Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf and flew in support of Operation Restore Hope and Operation Southern Watch. In 1994 VF-111 deployed again to the Pacific. Following this deployment, the squadron was disestablished on 31 March 1995 as part of post-Cold War force reductions of the Navy's F-14 community, with its aircraft reassigned to other F-14 squadrons. =Post-disestablishment= In November 2006, Fighter Composite Squadron 13 (VFC-13) Detachment Key West was established as Fighter Composite Squadron 111 (VFC-111), thus continuing the Sundowner tradition, but not the unit lineage. For more information on this later squadron, refer to the Wikipedia hyperlink VFC-111. Popular media * In 1985, VF-111 was one of several NAS Miramar based squadrons to participate in the filming of the film Top Gun. Some VF-111 and VF-51 aircraft were repainted in fictitious squadron markings for the film. To be able to film the sequences, the F-14s were fitted with cameras mounted in pods attached to the underbelly Phoenix pallets and the under wing pylons, as well as using ground mounted cameras. Also, one of the fictional RIOs in the film, played by Clarence Gilyard, uses the callsign \\"Sundown\\" and wears a VF-111 styled helmet and squadron patch on his flight suit.

It is accessed via the A91.  Etymology  The name Strathtyrum was recorded as Trestirum in 1190, and may rooted in either a Gaelic or Pictish etymology. The first element is either Gaelic treabh or Pictish *trev, cognates both meaning \\"farm, estate, town\\" (c.f. Welsh tref), assimilated to Gaelic srath, \\"valley\\". The second element is possibly Gaelic tiroam, \\"dry\\", or else an adaptation or translation of an earlier Pictish form. History Strathtyrum Course fairway of St Andrews Links Strathtyrum House's walled garden The estate was owned by St Andrews Cathedral Priory prior to the Reformation, whereafter ownership was granted to the Duke of Lennox and it subsequently changed hands several times. It was purchased by Archbishop James Sharp in 1669 and by James Cheape, the son of a laird, in 1782. The adjacent property of St Andrews Links on the northern side of the estate was acquired by James Cheape in 1821 and sold by his brother's grandson, also named James Cheape, to The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 1893. Control of St Andrews Links was regulated by an act of Parliament in 1894 and another in 1974 which resulted in the creation of the St Andrews Links Trust. The Strathtyrum Course of St Andrews Links, which was opened in 1993, was built on land that was previously part of the estate and sold to the St Andrews Links Trust by Mrs Gladys Cheape in 1986. The Strathtyrum estate was subsequently inherited by Henry Ismay Cheape. Buildings There are several buildings on the estate including the main residential building Strathtyrum House located opposite the Old Course at St Andrews, a Category A listed building built in the 18th century. It is a Georgian building three storeys high accompanied by riding stables, a mausoleum and a large walled garden. It was the rented country residence of publisher John Blackwood who died there in 1879. While attending the University of St Andrews where they met, Prince William and his future wife Catherine Middleton lived in Balgove House on the estate for two years before graduating in 2005.

He is particularly known as a historian of philosophy and translator of ancient philosophical texts. Biography Olof Gigon, son of the physician Alfred Gigon (1883-1975), was born and grew up in Basel, where he studied classical and oriental philology. He spent one semester in Munich in years 1932/33. During his studies, he learned Arabic, Persian and Turkish. Gigon received his doctorate in 1934 with the dissertation research on Heraclitus. He spent the next two years studying in Paris. In 1937, he qualified as an assistant professor with an investigation of Theophrastus's About the winds. In 1939, at the age of 27 years, Gigon was called a professor of classical studies at the University of Fribourg. After the Second World War, from 1946 to 1948, he was a guest professor teaching at the University of Munich. In 1948, Gigon was appointed professor of Latin Studies at the University of Bern, where he worked until his retirement in 1982 and beyond. In the academic year 1966-67 he was rector of the University. He received in 1966 the honorary doctorate from the University of Gothenburg and in 1974 the University of Athens. In Athens he spent his last years. Research Gigon was one of the most important historians of philosophy of the 20th century and dealt with the whole range of ancient philosophy. His books have been translated into many languages. An example of his work is the demystification of the figure of Socrates. Gigon pointed out that the Socrates, as represented by his student Plato, is a medium of Plato's own worldview. Gigon was also of the opinion that all problems of modern philosophy were recognizable already in ancient philosophy, even if sometimes only in their infancy.

During his novitiate he received the religious name of Marie-Joseph and was known for his strong determination to his studies to fulfil his lifelong wish of being ordained to the priesthood. Cassant suffered from extreme tuberculosis around the time of his ordination and died not long after he was made a priest. Pope John Paul II celebrated his beatification on 3 October 2004. Life Pierre-Joseph Cassant was born on 6 March 1878 in France to parents who were orchard-keepers as the second child born to them; his older brother was Emile (b. 1869) who was nine at the time of Cassant's birth. He was a lodger at a boarding school that the De La Salle Brothers ran and it was here that his abilities in memorizing things were quite diminished and led to increasing learning difficulties. Despite these failings he was seen as a quiet and caring child. It was at the age of 14 that he realized that he wanted to become a priest but learning difficulties prevented him from entering the seminary, so went to the parish priest Father Filhol for advice; he suggested he seek out the Trappists. Cassant entered a Cistercian convent in Sainte-Marie du D√©sert on 5 December 1894 where he was placed under the charge of Father Andr√© Mallet who said to him: \\"only trust and I will help you to love Jesus\\". During his novitiate he received the name of \\"Marie-Joseph\\" and he often spent time meditating upon Christ in his Passion and on the Cross, and he depended on Him for strength during his studies. To further advance his chances of studying for the priesthood, he underwent further studies of the French language and began to learn Latin. It was around this time that he formed his personal motto, \\"all for Jesus, all through Mary\\". He made his final vows on the Feast of the Ascension on 24 May 1900. From this point onwards he focused on becoming a priest and he viewed Holy Orders in relation to the Eucharist as being a critical facet of the duties of a priest. Around this time, at the age of 21, he was summoned for mandatory military service and was discharged for reasons of health in March 1900. He commenced his theological studies for the priesthood and suffered difficulties in doing so due to the same issue that plagued him when he was in school. The monk assigned to teach him humiliated and ridiculed him in public and said: \\"You are totally limited! It is useless for you to study. You will not learn any more. To ordain you would be a dishonor to the priesthood\\", yet Mallet assisted him with the course. Among his fellow seminarians he became well regarded, and some said of him: \\"He was always happy. It's what made the beauty of his face\\". Despite difficulties he was ordained as a priest on 12 October 1902. Immediately after this on 13 October, he was granted seven weeks of rest due to the advancement of tuberculosis he suffered. Despite his time of rest, his lungs were damaged beyond the point of repair and it made his breathing ever more difficult, and his health continued to worsen when he returned to the monastery on 2 December 1902. In his illness it was Mallet who became his close aid and support. Cassant said \\"when I can no longer say Mass, Jesus can take me from this world\\", in relation to his rapidly declining health. Cassant became part of the Association of Victim Souls dedicated to the oblation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ and signed an Act of Oblation to emulate the tenets of the organization. Cassant followed in the footsteps of those who were part of the congregation such as Charles de Foucauld, Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster, and Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto, the future Pope Pius X. Cassant celebrated his final Mass on 31 May 1903 and received the last rites on the following 1 June. He died of tuberculosis in the dawn of 17 June 1903 after receiving Communion during a private Mass that Mallet celebrated for him; his final words were: \\"Jesus, Mary, Joseph, assist me in my last agony\\". Since his death there have been more than 2200 people from 30 countries that have reported miracles attributed to his intercession. Beatification The beatification process opened in Toulouse in 1935 and concluded before the formal introduction of the cause on 19 February 1956 under Pope Pius XII; this process enabled him to receive the title Servant of God. Following this there was one final process to continue the work of the first process. Once that was completed the postulation compiled the Positio for the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome to evaluate. Pope John Paul II proclaimed him to be Venerable on 9 June 1984 on the account of his model Christian life of heroic virtue and beatified him on 3 October 2004 after the approval of a miracle: the healing of a nine year old from cerebrospinal meningitis who was healed a day after praying to Cassant. The current postulator of the cause is Sister Augusta Tescari.

Cook, starring Hans Bachmann, A. Thomas Smith and Rick Foucheux. It is the story of a journalist who uncovers an extraterrestrial entity taking over an air force base in Washington, D.C. and must foil its plans of world domination. Most of Invader was produced independently in 1989 by Philip Cook and producer John Ellis, since Cook's previous film Beyond the Rising Moon had not been enough of a success to attract investors. Cook shot all the inexpensive dialogue sequences, and the result impressed Menahem Golan such that he agreed to finance the remainder of the film. Invader was originally released on VHS by Trimark and LaserDisc by Pioneer Corporation, and earned some positive reviews. In 2006, Invader was recut by Cook's production company Eagle Films for its DVD release. The new release features CGI special effects to augment the in-camera effects from 1992. Plot In the opening sequence, four airmen from Clark Air Base in Washington D.C. frantically attempt to escape the base. A contingent of soldiers soon blocks their path. Most of the escapees are shot, but one sees a flying saucer which burns him to a crisp with its energy weapon. Frank Mccall (Hans Bachmann) is an overqualified photojournalist writing about two-headed dogs and alien abductions for the sleazy National Scandal tabloid. When the airman's charred corpse is found, he is assigned to the story. When government agents try to keep him out, he resolves to sneak into the airbase, where a top-secret fighter plane is to be demoed that night. The plane is equipped with an experimental software system called A.S.M.O.D.S, which suddenly malfunctions mid-demo, crashing the plane. As the disappointed top brass go home, Mccall is intercepted by Captain Anders (A. Thomas Smith), who orders him taken into custody and his camera seized. Sinister men in black wrench Mccall away, taking him to a storage compartment to be injected with a glowing green substance and brainwashed with an electronic apparatus. Anders and Colonel Faraday (Rick Foucheux) arrive in time to stop them, and the men shoot themselves. Anders takes Mccall into custody himself, while Faraday returns to the base. Suddenly, the flying saucer from the opening appears. Anders shoots it, to no effect, while Mccall photographs it with his backup disc camera. Powerless against the invader, they drive away, dodging more men in black on the way, and lock themselves in the base. Mccall's camera is again confiscated, its photos to be developed as evidence. Mccall manages to secure the prints, and also spies on Anders conversing with the General. He thus finds out that the A.S.M.O.D.S. system uses alien technology recovered from a crashed spaceship in the New Mexico desert, and this technology seems to have a mind of its own. The men in black break their way in, so Mccall escapes with Anders in the F-117 stealth fighter. They have a brief dogfight with some F-16s out of Clark, which ends when they manage to secure air support from the Pentagon. Mccall and Anders are questioned, and eventually manage to convince General Anheiser (John Cook) that A.S.M.O.D.S. has taken over the base computers using the intranet, and brainwashed all of the soldiers into its control. They agree to go investigate the next day. In between time, Mccall quits his job at the Scandal, realizing he is onto the story of the century. At the airbase, the trio is greeted by a now-brainwashed Faraday. His troops destroy their helicopter escort, and he takes them down to the subbasement, which has been excavated into a gaping cavern. There Faraday reveals the alien's plan: it cannibalized the base hardware to build a giant robot, HARV, with which to conquer the world after nuking China and Russia. Mccall realizes that just as the alien programming seeped into A.S.M.O.D.S., so A.S.M.O.D.S. has seeped into the alien, arming it with a nationalistic impulse to destroy America's enemies. The protagonists manage to shoot Faraday's guards. HARV tries to stop them, but only succeeds in killing Faraday. They search the basement for weapons with which to destroy HARV and avert World War III. They find a rocket launcher and two rockets; their first attempt misses, but the second is a direct hit, with one second to spare before HARV would launch the missiles. The ending sequence shows several newspapers honoring Mccall for his heroics, while the National Scandal claims the alien invasion was a hoax. Production After finishing the space adventure film Beyond the Rising Moon in 1987, director Philip Cook and producer John Ellis decided their next picture should be more grounded so they would not need to build sets from scratch. Cook wrote the screenplay for Invader, then known as The Killing edge, in two weeks. He was inspired by the political climate of the time to give the film an edge of satire, and determined to make it more fun and lightweight than Moon, which he found \\"a little pretentious\\". Cook wrote the parts of Mccall and Faraday with Hans Bachmann and Rick Foucheux from Moon already in mind; the actor originally chosen for the role of Anders declined after having a falling out with the producer. Foucheux introduced Cook to John Cooke, who played General Anheiser; they knew each other through Washington's theater scene. Cook and Ellis could not raise enough money for the entire film at the time, so in winter of 1989 they shot $50,000's worth of live-action footage‚Äîhoping to later convince investors to finance the more effects- intensive scenes. Due to the limited budget, the production ran on a skeleton crew: Cook, Ellis, a camera assistant and a sound recordist. Cook was the film's director, cinematographer, special effects supervisor and editor. Ellis did the miniature pyrotechnics, and took care of various odds and ends. Crewmembers collaborated in building the sets and miniatures. They took the film to the American Film Market, and Menahem Golan agreed to front the $125,000 required to finish. The remaining scenes were shot between the fall of 1990 and 1991. As in Moon, most special effects were achieved using miniatures‚ÄîCook credits Gerry Anderson's shows as a creative influence. The helicopter ridden by the heroes never left the ground: the shots of flight were accomplished with remote control models. The battle with HARV in the cavern was filmed using stop-motion animation on a miniature set. Matte paintings were used to integrate the actors into the cavern. Release Invader was remastered with CGI for its DVD release. In this computer- generated scene, an F-117 stealth fighter flies over Washington D.C. According to Ellis's website Invader premiered on April 4, 1992 in Columbus, Ohio. was distributed on VHS by Trimark and LaserDisc by Pioneer in 1992. Cook recalls that it sold well. It also ran on the television networks HBO and Cinemax. For the 2006 DVD release, Cook's production company Eagle Films produced a new version of Invader with CGI enhancements to the original 1992 in-camera special effects. The most significant changes were made to the dogfight scene. Trimark (a.k.a. Vidmark, now Lionsgate) chose the cover artwork for the film, which depicts a squad of futuristic-looking soldiers that never appear in the film. Cook relates that the crew was perplexed by this choice, but figured the image's visual appeal would sell a lot of videotapes. The art was used again for the Lionsgate DVD release. =Reception= Cavett Binion, writing for the New York Times, found the picture's \\"modestly entertaining if not particularly original\\", citing similarities to Colossus: The Forbin Project. She also remarked that it features the same kind of \\"goofy paranoia\\" that would later fuel The X-Files. Leonard Maltin enjoyed the \\"clever\\" script and \\"impressive\\" budget-conscious special effects. Similar praise was issued by Imagi-Movies and Cinefantastique. Martial arts film producer Godfrey Ho was also impressed by the cinematography in Invader, so much so that he hired Cook as director of photography for Undefeatable.

[et al.]; direcci√≥ cient√≠fica, Jordi Casassas i.  Biography  Ballester was the son of Vicen√ß Ballester (from Calaf, Anoia) and Cristina Camps (from Lleida), where the family owned lands and flour mills. He had early ties to the town of El Masnou, having worked there and later raised a family there. He began his studies in seamanship in 1890, having already learned to sail in El Masnou.Muray, Joan. After four years, in 1894, he obtained his merchant pilot's license which allowed him to sail as a captain. Nevertheless, his career in the merchant marine was cut short for health reasons: he had osseous problems in one of his knees. This did not, however, keep Ballester from going to Cuba, in 1898 when the Caribbean island declared its independence. Upon his return to El Masnou he became a partner and employee in a company that commercialized acetylene gas, used at the time for street lighting. Once Ballester established himself more in El Masnou, he began to participate in political activities promoting Catalan nationalism, especially through several Catalanist publications.Muray, Joan. In 1901 he became a member of the Foment Autonomista Catal√† and head of La Reixa, and as such organised the acts of the September 11, 1908 (Catalonia's National Day) which resulted in a prison sentence. He was also a member of the Associaci√≥ Protectora de l'Ensenyan√ßa Catalana (Association for the Protection of Education in Catalan) and in 1903 founded the magazine La Tralla writing under the pseudonym VIC (whose initials in Catalan stand for \\"Long Live the Independence of Catalonia\\") and VICIME (\\"Long Live the Independence of Catalonia and Die Spain\\"). He was also a member of the Associaci√≥ Nacionalista Catalana (Catalan Nationalist Association). He collaborated in the bulletin of the CADCI and formed part of the Uni√≥ Catalanista (Catalanist Union). In 1915 he took part in the foundation of the Moss√®n Cinto School, of which he was president that same year.Muray, Joan. In 1918, after the end of the First World War, he was one of the promoters of the Committee Pro Catalonia, which aimed to get recognition for the effort of the Catalan Volunteers in the First World War in order to ask the Society of Nations for support for Catalan independence, following the postulates of the US president Woodrow Wilson, who defended the right to self- determination of peoples. It is in this committee that Vincent Albert Ballester created the estelada flag.Muray, Joan. Ballester was a very active Catalan activist and in 1923 he was one of the participants (and later chronicler) of the September 11th demonstration that year, which was violently put down with sabre charges, just one day before the coup d'√©tat of general Primo of Rivera.Muray, Joan. Ballester backed the foreign campaign of Francesc Maci√†'s Catalan State although he was critical with the planned invasion from Prats de Moll√≥. Beginning in 1924 he was the last president of Uni√≥ Catalanista (Catalanist Union), which under his leadership became a political party and adopted a pro-independence ideology. Ballester collaborated with numerous Catalan magazines in the Americas, including Ressorigiment (Revival) de Buenos Aires, and La Nova Catalunya in Havana, Cuba. Gravely ill, he died shortly before the Francoist occupation of Catalonia.  Legacy  In August 2009, the town of Vic voted to name a square in his honor. In January 2014 a square in the Ciutat Vella district of Barcelona was inaugurated with his name. ¬´Barcelona dedica una pla√ßa al creador de l'estelada¬ª. ¬´El pare de l'estelada, al nomencl√†tor de Barcelona. In mid-2014, the city of Girona paid homage to the estelada designer by lending his name to the Montilivi municipal gardens after having voted the resolution six years earlier during the centennial celebration of the Estelada.

All four hotels are located within several blocks of one another in Downtown Spokane. History The modern branding such as the logo takes inspiration from past marketing materials =Creation of the brand= The roots of the hotel brand coincide with the restoration and 2002 reopening of the historic Davenport Hotel in Downtown Spokane. At the time, the brand collection consisted of just the historic hotel, and was merely known as The Davenport Hotel. In January 2007, Worthy opened a new, 328-room, 21-floor hotel tower across the street from the historic hotel. Despite being a separate building with a separate architecture and theme, the tower was operated as part of the historic hotel. To reflect this, brand name was updated to The Davenport Hotel and Tower. =Expansion of the brand= Hotel Lusso In 2009, Worthy acquired the Hotel Lusso, a boutique hotel also located across the street from the historic hotel. After this acquisition, the Davenport brand was restructured into its present-day name and format of The Davenport Hotel Collection whereby the hotels would be marketed as separate properties under a unified Davenport brand umbrella. The historic hotel was subsequently marketed as The Historic Davenport Hotel, the tower referred to as The Davenport Tower, and the Lusso adopted the name The Davenport Lusso. In 2013, work on a fourth hotel under The Davenport Hotel Collection brand began. The new hotel, named The Davenport Grand, is located directly across from the Spokane Convention Center, and is the largest building constructed in the city since The Davenport Tower in 2007, standing at around 18 stories tall. Construction was completed in 2015 including a skywalk to connect the hotel with the Convention Center. The new hotel is not quite as tall as the tower hotel, but has a very long-thin design. Beginning in 2014, all hotels in the brand collection became affiliated with Marriott as part of their Autograph Collection Hotels chain. The Hotels Davenport Hotel Tower =The Historic Davenport Hotel= The Historic Davenport Hotel was restored and opened in 2002. It features 284 guest rooms and has a spa, a gym and an indoor pool. =The Davenport Tower= The Davenport Tower opened in 2007 and features a safari theme. It features 328 guest rooms on 21 floors and has an indoor pool, an on-site restaurant, and a cocktail lounge. =The Davenport Lusso= The Davenport Lusso was acquired and added to the brand collection by Walt Worthy in May 2009. It is a boutique hotel and originally opened in 1998 after two historic buildings were purchased, combined, and renovated. It features 48 guest rooms and a pub. =The Davenport Grand= The Davenport Grand Hotel The Davenport Grand opened in 2015 and features a contemporary theme. It is the largest hotel in Spokane by number of guest rooms with 716 guest rooms on 17 floors (16 above ground level) and has two restaurants, a gym and a whiskey bar on a terrace overlooking Riverfront Park. It is located directly across from the Spokane Convention Center and is targeted at business and convention travelers. Construction began in September 2013 on a site originally reserved for convention center expansion. The land was sold to the Worthys for $6.67 million and the hotel was constructed for an estimated $138 million.

It is dedicated to the Genoese who died during World War I, and it was inaugurated on 31 May 1931. History The inauguration of the Arco della Vittoria on 31 May 1931 In 1923, the comune of Genoa decided to build a commemorative monument while redeveloping an area that was previously a wet meadow. It announced a national contest for the design of an arch to be built on a lawn located adjacent to the Bisagno stream. The stream is now buried under Via Brigate Partigiane Sixteen proposals were submitted, and the jury chose the draft by the architect Marcello Piacentini and the sculptor Arturo Dazzi. The commission chose it because the design was inspired by Imperial Roman and 16th century architecture, giving the monument a strong, heroic and triumphant appearance. Piacentini later modified the design of the arch, making it simpler. Construction was carried out by the local Impresa Garbarino e Sciaccaluga, under the direction of Piacentini himself. The arch is deteriorating due to the action of rain. Description Detail of Arco della Vittoria The arch is built at the end of a semicircular ramp, and has two side doors leading to a crypt. In the sanctuary, there are some statues by sculptor Giovanni Prini representing Victories, Saint George and the coat of arms of Genoa. There are also other sculptures by Prini, including a reproduction of the bollettino della Vittoria, the bollettino della Marina and the names of the fallen. An altar made out of Levanto red marble is located at the centre of the structure. A bronze crucifix on a rosewood cross, which is the work of the sculptor , hangs above the altar. The monument rests on four corner pillars and eight ornate pillars, which are decorated with sculptures by Arturo Dazzi and De Albertis. Two large columns are located inside the arch, and they support lunettes sculpted by Prini dedicated to peace and the family. The exterior of the monument is decorated with allegories sculpted by Dazzi and Mario Maria Martini, which commemorate the 680,000 Italians killed in World War I and the construction of the arch. Dazzi's frieze develops in several episodes. Gunners and the Alpini are depicted on the north, while the Red Cross and the field mass are depicted on the sides. The artillery and the cavalry are depicted on the south side, while the Battles of the Isonzo and that of the Piave River are depicted on the sides. The Bersaglieri and the sappers are depicted on the west side, and Benito Mussolini is depicted as one of the soldiers. The air force and the navy are depicted on the east side.

Formerly an ancient settlement and village on the Porter Brook, it became integrated into the city in the 1930s. It is bounded by the suburbs of Lodge Moor to the NW, Ranmoor to the east and Crosspool to the NE. The open countryside of the Peak District lies to the west and SW. The sub districts of Stumperlowe and Goole Green are part of the suburb. The population of the ward at the 2011 Census was 18,233 History Fulwood was originally an Anglo-Saxon settlement, with the name originating from the Old English language ‚ÄúFul Wuda‚Äù meaning a ‚Äúwet, marshy woodland‚Äú.\\"Historic Hallamshire\\", David Hey, Landmark Collectors Library, , Gives historical details. However other interpretations of the name are ‚Äúfoul, dirty wood‚Äù and ‚Äúfolks wood‚Äù from the Old English ‚Äúfolc‚Äù.\\"More Of Mayfield Valley And Old Fulwood\\", Muriel Hall, J.W. Northend (1974), No ISBN, Etymology/Rivelin Chase. Prior to the Norman conquest of England Fulwood was part of the massive estate of the Anglo-Saxon Earl Waltheof. After the Earls execution in 1076 for his part in the Revolt of the Earls, the estate was awarded to the Norman Roger de Busli. Fulwood was mentioned in a document of 1297 when Thomas de Furnival established the Burgery of Sheffield, he stated that the inhabitants of ‚ÄúFolewode‚Äù be granted herbage and foliage throughout the whole of Rivelin Chase. Rivelin Chase, included the Forest of Fulwood and was the common name for an area of forests and moorland used by the Lords of the Manor of Sheffield for the hunting of deer and game and the grazing of farm animals. A record of 1181 states that Fulwood Booth farm was used to rear young cattle for the Lords of Hallamshire. To protect the deer in Fulwood and Rivelin, keepers were appointed by the Lord of the Manor, the head keeper was known as ‚ÄúMaster of the Game‚Äù and each keeper was paid a salary of ¬£2 per year.\\"The Ancient Suburbs Of Sheffield\\", J. Edward Vickers, Self Published (1971), No ISBN, Page 26/27 Rivelin Chase/Fulwood Spa. In another document of that time the Canons of Beauchief Abbey were granted a grange at Fulwood in return for taking services in the Lord of the Manor's chapel. The monks of the grange were licensed to graze their cattle and goats and also carried out lead mining in the area of the present day Bole Hill farm. The grange became the property of Francis Talbot, 5th Earl of Shrewsbury upon the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the late 1530s. The Thomas Boulsover memorial at Wire Mill Dam The Fox family built Fulwood Hall on the north side of the Mayfield valley, it was one of the first large houses in the area and is believed to date from the 15th century. Bennett Grange on Harrison Lane was built 400 metres to the west of Fulwood Hall in 1580, over the years it belonged to the Hall, Hind and Bennet families, it has been added to over the years and still stands today overlooking the Mayfield valley. Picture Sheffield Bennet Grange. Stumperlowe Hall was constructed in the 1650s by the Mitchell family who been landowners in the area since the 14th century, the hall was completely rebuilt in the 1850s. During the ravages of the Great Plague of 1666, Fulwood Spa became a popular resort for people alarmed by the spread of the disease. The spa was a spring of mineral water situated in the Porter valley near the present day Whitley Lane, it was created by Thomas Eaton who covered the spring with a building, many Sheffield people came to ‚Äútake the waters‚Äù. Industrial use of the rivers in the area started in 1641 when Ulysses Fox of Fulwood Hall built a corn mill on the Mayfield Brook just before its confluence with the Porter Brook. Thomas Boulsover, the inventor of Sheffield plate made further industrial use of the Porter in the Fulwood area in the 1760s when he constructed the Whiteley Wood rolling mill for the manufacture of saws and edge tools, Boulsover lived in the nearby Whiteley Wood Hall on the south bank of the Porter from 1757 till his death in 1788.\\"Water Power On The Sheffield Rivers\\", David Crossley (editor), Sheffield Trades Historical Society, pages 70-73 , Details of water mills. The Nonconformist Fulwood Old Chapel was constructed in 1729 for the use of Unitarians. The Church of England did not respond to the growth of Sheffield as an industrial town until the late 1830s when Fulwood parish was one of 25 new ecclesiastical districts created as the ancient parish of Sheffield was divided and Christ Church on present day Canterbury Avenue was opened in 1839 as the parish church.\\"A History Of Sheffield\\", David Hey, Carnegie Publishing, , Gives historical details. J. & C. Walker's map of Yorkshire of 1836 shows ‚ÄúFullwood‚Äù as an isolated settlement well outside the town of Sheffield, however from the 1830s onward many of the more prosperous of the town's inhabitants moved further west to build villas on the south facing slopes of Fulwood, Ranmoor and Ecclesall. By the 1870s Fulwood was described in John Marius Wilson‚Äòs ‚ÄúImperial Gazetteer of England and Wales‚Äù as a village in a vale under Hallam moors, four miles wsw of Sheffield with a population of 1,801 and 368 houses. Visions Of Britain Quote from Imperial Gazetteer. When Sheffield was made a City in 1893 Fulwood was still a tiny settlement and it was not until the 1920s and 1930s that large numbers of people were attracted to the area by cheap land and good transport links, prompting a large number of privately owned dwellings to be built. The Guildhall on Fulwood Road Fulwood House. Other Significant Buildings Fulwood House on Old Fulwood Road is a large structure built in 1920 for the Wilsons, a well known local family involved in the manufacture of snuff. It was eventually purchased by the Sheffield Regional Hospital Board in 1948 and is now part of the headquarters of the Sheffield Health & Social Care NHS Foundation Trust, housing conference and training facilities and other meeting rooms. Two other adjacent buildings to Fulwood House are also part of the headquarters, these are the Vic Hallam Building and the 7 Storey Tower Block. The tower block is a significant landmark in the area and has caused some controversy as it is out of character with much of the architecture in the area. Sheffield Health & Social Care Details of Fulwood House.\\"Fulwood And The Mayfield Valley\\", Roger Redfern, Cottage Press (2005), , Fulwood House/Old School House. The Guildhall on Fulwood Road dates from 1824, it is thought that it was formerly part of the outbuildings of Goole Green farm before becoming the parish church hall. It is now a private residence. Stumperlowe Grange on Stumperlowe Hall Road is a large late 17th century house, which originally had 50 acres of land it was remodelled and extended in the 19th century by W.E. Laycock owner of Samuel Laycock and Sons, hair seating manufacturers, and Mayor of Sheffield in 1865. It has now been divided into two large private residences. Much of the Grange's land was sold off for house building in the first half of the 20th century Stumperlowe Cottage is a former farmer's cottage with adjoining cruck barn which is now one large single storey residence. It was restored in the 1980s after falling into a ruined state and threatened with demolition. The Old School House on School Green Lane dates from 1736, it has a stone plaque above the door listing the benefactors. It became a private house in 1840 after a new school was built behind the parish church. The old stocks date from the early 19th century, they stand in front of Fulwood chapel but were formerly on the village green. The Sheffield Royal Hospital had an annexe at Fulwood off Brookhouse Hill overlooking the Porter valley, built in 1907 it closed in 1986 and is now a private housing development known as Mayfield Heights, it is rated as a building of Townscape Merit. =Fulwood conservation area= An area based on the old core of Fulwood village has been designated a conservation area, it also takes in the Porter Brook's wooded valley bottom. It includes many architecturally interesting buildings including ten listed buildings plus the war memorial, village stocks and the Thomas Boulsover monument. The former industrial sites of Forge Dam and Wire Mill Dam are also included as are the local nature reserve at Whiteley Woods. Sheffield City Council Details of Conservation Area. Modern amenities The main areas of recreation in Fulwood are the linear parks along the valley of the Porter Brook. Whiteley Woods park covers an area of 11.5 hectares while Forge Dam is a rectangular green space with an area of 9.5 hectares and has a caf√© and children's playground. Both parks are part of the Porter Valley Parks, a string of interconnected green areas along the valley which features a 4.5 km long footpath starting at Endcliffe Park and finishing at Porter Clough in open countryside beyond Fulwood. The small shopping area on Brooklands Avenue. There is an area of shops on Brooklands Avenue near its junction with Crimicar Lane and also a nearby retail area on Fulwood Road at Nether Green, although Nether Green is part the suburb of Ranmoor. Until the opening of the Ale Club micro-pub in December 2019 there were no public houses within Fulwood. The two most used doctor's surgeries are outside the suburb with Nether Green surgery used by 43% and Broomhill surgery used by 33% of the population. The nearest secondary schools are located just outside the suburb at Notre Dame, High Storrs and Tapton. Fulwood is connected to Sheffield city centre by the 120 bus operated by First South Yorkshire, which runs every 10 minutes on weekdays with a slightly reduced service at weekends, the journey takes approximately 35 minutes. The Sheffield Neighbourhood Health and Well Being Profile for 2012 gave Fulwood a population of 6,447 and stated that it is one of the least deprived neighbourhoods in Sheffield, this is backed up by the 2011 report ‚ÄúDeprivation in Sheffield‚Äù by the University of Sheffield which states ‚ÄúEcclesall is the least deprived neighbourhood in Sheffield, followed by Fulwood, Bents Green, Crosspool, Whirlow, Abbeydale and Millhouses ‚Äì all of which are within the 10% least deprived locations in England‚Äú. It also says Crime is significantly low in Fulwood and educational attainment and attendance is significantly better than average.

The ticket office was closed, replaced by automatic ticket machines, which have been criticized for their sometimes poor operation. The ticket machines were replaced in June 2009 with two more functional and multilingual ticket machines.

Her academic work focuses mainly on the study of primary orality, as well as the mnemonic devices used by ancient and modern oral cultures from around the world. She proposes a theory on the purpose of the Stonehenge megalithic, which she believes served as a centre for the transmission of knowledge among Neolithic Britons. She has been interviewed on different podcasts and radio programs about her work on primary orality, popular science and skepticism. Work and education Kelly holds a Bachelor of Engineering from Monash University, a Graduate Diploma of Computing from Deakin University, a Diploma of Education from Rusden State College, a Master of Education from Melbourne University and a Doctoral Degree from La Trobe University. Kelly's writing also includes educational resources for courses on mathematics, thinking skills and information technology, as well as a novel. Kelly has also published books for popular science audiences on spiders, crocodiles and skepticism. She has previously worked as a teacher and she currently works as an Honorary Research Fellow at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia. Research on primary orality and memory A fundamental part of Kelly's research delves into the transmission of scientific and technological knowledge among small-scale oral cultures such as Aboriginal Australians, the Pueblo people and some African cultures. Kelly's research indicates that oral cultures possess a large body of scientific knowledge on animal behavior, plant properties, the landscape, natural phenomena, location of sacred places and water sources. This knowledge is encoded in myths, rituals, chants and mnemonic devices. According to Kelly's theory, the manner of accessing stored information would depend on whether the culture was mobile or more settled. Hunter-gatherer societies would depend on portable mnemonic devices and techniques that would allow them to use the landscape as a mnemonic tool, such as the method of loci. Kelly has observed similar techniques within the modern Australian Aborigines, who use features on the landscape as visual cues to retrieve information. On the other hand, societies that were less mobile but not completely settled would create local replications of the landscape to access information, such as circles of timber or stone, sequences of mounds and other prehistoric built environments. Kelly's research also indicates that both nomadic and sedentary societies rely on performance and entertainment as a part of their complex knowledge storage system. The use of songs and rituals is a vital component of retention techniques which further strengthens memorization, and it is ubiquitous among the cultures studied by Kelly. People participating in the performance would sing and tell stories while also touching a mnemonic object, moving around the site, or dancing, as a way to trigger kinaesthetic cues to access the knowledge. Lynne Kelly has spoken against the portrayal of native peoples by the media, and sometimes even in academia, as having a close relationship with their environment but being at the same time simplistic and superstitious. These portrayals tend to focus only on their religion and rituals, and very rarely acknowledge their vast scientific knowledge. In 2015, Kelly published a book under the title Knowledge and Power in Prehistoric Societies, which incorporates the research from her doctoral thesis When Knowledge Was Power. This work explores the link between power and the control of knowledge in oral cultures, as well as the different mnemonic techniques and devices used by those cultures. Kelly also suggests a new theory on the purpose of the archaeological sites of Chaco Canyon, Poverty Point and Stonehenge. =The Memory Code= In June 2016, Kelly's doctoral research was published for a general readership under the title The Memory Code. This work comprises the results of Kelly's research, spanning over almost a decade, into mnemonics of Indigenous peoples from around the globe. Kelly's work on Australian Aboriginals includes the identification of songlines with memory techniques. She has found research stating that up to 70% of these songlines contains knowledge about animals, plants and seasons. The book created much interest from the media and the public even before its release. Since the publication of The Memory Code, Kelly has been invited to numerous radio shows and public lectures to discuss her work on indigenous knowledge, mnemonics and the application of memory techniques and devices in everyday life. Kelly has been known for trying the same techniques she has researched to memorize long lists of categories and events, including succeeding to memorize all the countries of the world by population order; memorizing a historical chronology of prehistoric and historic events, and a guide of the 408 birds of the state of Victoria. She has memorized those lists and events using the loci method, the help of mnemonic devices, and by creating stories connecting the elements she is trying to memorize. Kelly has received the support and orientation of Australian Aboriginal advisors for her research, particularly of her colleague Nungarrayi, who is Warlpiri. =Theory on the purpose of Stonehenge= Inside Stonehenge, facing northeast, April 2005 According to Kelly's theory, Stonehenge served the purpose of a mnemonic centre for recording and retrieving knowledge by Neolithic Britons, who lacked written language. The knowledge could have included pragmatic information on animal classification and behavior, geography and navigation, land management and crop cycles, as well as cultural knowledge on history, politics, genealogy and religion. In Knowledge and Power in Prehistoric Societies, Kelly suggests that knowledge may have been originally preserved by the nomadic Britons by using the landscape as a mnemonic tool, in a similar fashion to the memorization technique known as Method of loci. As the Britons started to settle, they would have needed to modify the way they stored their knowledge as they were not moving as much anymore, so they would have built Stonehenge in an attempt to replicate the landscape locally, allowing them to memorize and store knowledge. The circles and stones or timber posts would have represented the landscape, and each stone would have been associated with a segment of their knowledge system. Kelly's research also indicates that once the Neolithic Britons' society settled, the ceremonial spaces would have become more restricted and the rituals controlled by the elites. Kelly's theory on the purpose of Stonehenge would also explain certain physical features such as circles or lines of posts and ditches at other archaeological sites such as the Durrington Walls and Avebury, which previously had not been explained. Kelly's theory is sustained by the record of archaeological changes and level of activity registered at Stonehenge. Those changes would be consistent with the social changes the Neolithic Britons would have experienced whilst transitioning from a hunter-gatherer society, where the knowledge was shared by the elders, to a sedentary society whose knowledge was restricted to the elites and transmitted via apprenticeship. This change in the control of knowledge would have eventually made Stonehenge unused and its primary purpose forgotten. Her theory is also consistent with her previous research on mnemonic techniques used by ancient and modern cultures and the use of temples, myths and legends to pass on and remember knowledge. As the chance of survival for oral cultures is strongly dependent on their ability to store and retrieve information, the great efforts and the participation of the entire community on the construction of a site as large as Stonehenge are explained and justifiable. Works on popular science Kelly is also known for her contribution to popular science literature. In 2006, she published a book on crocodiles under the title Crocodile: evolution's greatest survivor. In this work, Kelly collects both folklore and human-crocodile interactions from across the world, as well as the biology, behavior and evolution of crocodilians. In 2009, Kelly published her book Spiders: Learning to Love Them, where she explores the biology and human perceptions around spiders, as well as offers a guide for spider identification. It is also a recount of the author's personal journey from disliking spiders to being fascinated by them. The book won \\"Best book in the category of Natural History\\" in the 2009 Whitley Awards by the Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales. Work in skepticism Kelly has also been an active promoter of skepticism and educating the public on the importance of critical thinking and science. She has claimed to use magicians' tricks to advance skepticism. She was a founding member of the Australian Skeptics, and has spoken at their national convention in 2003, 2012 and 2015. In 2004, she was awarded the Skeptic of the Year title by the organization. Kelly's interest in skepticism derives in part from her concern about how fake mediums and psychics exploit gullible or vulnerable people. She has criticized television shows which present mediums and psychics as a fact, which in her opinion could undermine the understanding of science among teenagers. Kelly also considers that a belief in the supernatural prevents people from appreciating science and the real wonders of the world, and causes unnecessary fear in young people. Lynne Kelly, Australian Skeptics National Convention 2015 =Cold reading and tauromancy= Kelly has also investigated psychics and cold reading techniques. Kelly has investigated the methods used by psychics to convince their clients of their alleged supernatural powers, and she even experimented performing astrology readings. She later developed her own divination system, which she named Tauromancy, which she uses to debunk psychics by showing how it is possible to create an illusion of a psychic reading just through psychology and by using the client's reactions to the reader's suggestions. Her method includes objects suggestive of magic, such as a purported handwritten and illustrated book with the history of the tradition, a mat, essences, rods and metal masks. Kelly has claimed that the effect of a successful reading is so powerful that even though she has revealed in advance to the customers that she is in fact not a real psychic, they refuse to believe that the information and personal details were obtained by mere cold reading techniques. On some occasions, Kelly has had to stop the reading as the client has become extremely emotional, with Kelly offering counselling instead, in which she has been trained. She has also said that intelligent people are easier to read as they have a larger pool of references to use to respond to her cues. In 2003 she wrote a novel for young adults titled Avenging JanieKelly 2003. which incorporated cold reading and a cult into the plot. The book was well received. Writer John Marsden said of it, \\"It's good to be reminded that there are still new plots out there - and writers for young people brave enough to take them on.\\" Cold reading expert Ian Rowland said, \\"it really is an amazing piece of work.\\" =The Skeptic's Guide to the Paranormal= Kelly has also written a book on the paranormal from a skeptic's point of view, aimed at a non-skeptical audience, titled The Skeptic's Guide to the Paranormal. In this work, Kelly explores a range of popular claims and stories about allegedly paranormal events such as crop circles, psychic detectives, and communicating with the dead, providing plausible scientific explanations for each of these phenomena. Awards and recognition * Kelly's book Spiders: learning to love them was awarded a Certificate of Commendation in the \\"Natural History\\" class of the 2009 Whitley Awards from the Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales. * She was awarded an Arts Victoria literary grant for 2015, to develop Ancient Memory Spaces, \\"a literary non-fiction manuscript demonstrating the memory techniques used by non-literate societies to store and share knowledge of their culture\\". * In 2004, she was named the Skeptic of the Year by the Australian Skeptics.

It was founded in 1931 and based on the Imperial Commercial College which was established in 1772. In 2011, the University with its six departments merged with ITMO University as Institute of Refrigeration and Biotechnologies. At the time it had 6,500 students and 82 instructors. In 2015 it was transformed into the Department of Cryogenic Techniques and Air Conditioning and Department of Food Biotechnologies and Engineering of ITMO University.  History = Commercial College = ; 1772 ‚Äì 1918 In 1772, Prokofi Akinfiyevich Demidov turned to Catherine II with a suggestion to open as part of the Moscow Foundling Home an ‚ÄúEducational School for Children from Merchant Families for Commerce.‚Äù A regular donor to the Foundling home, he donated 205,000 rubles for education of merchant children. On Dec. 6, 1772 the academic plan was approved, marking the founding date of the school. In 1779 by the order of Catherine II the school was renamed after Demidov and bared its name up until its move to St. Petersburg in 1800. Photo pre-revolutionary building of Imperial Commercial College on Lomonosov st. After the death of Catherine II in 1796, Pavel I named his wife Maria Fedorovna ‚ÄúHead of the Society for Education of Noble Maidens‚Äù and on May 2, 1797 she took over supervision of Moscow and St. Petersburg Foundling homes. Almost instantly she decided to move the Commercial College to St. Petersburg, closer to her, and to separate it from the Home. In 1830-40's Russia needed mechanics and engineers, which was reflected in the curriculum. In January 1843, education in the last years was augmented with chemistry, mechanics and drafting. It became mandatory to have an internship both at commercial companies and manufacturing facilities of St. Petersburg.Baranenko, p. 42 In 1870-80 Russia experienced a boost that resulted from the abolition of serfdom. The College's new curriculum included new classes in engineering and technologies. Students were expected to know about the origins of goods, their chemical and physical characteristics, the level of their quality. In the course on commodities, much time was spent on technologies for processing and storing foodstuffs.Baranenko, p. 54-56 Later these courses played an important role in the establishment of the Institute of Refrigeration and Food Processing. On Dec. 14, 1904 the St. Petersburg Commercial College gained the status of Imperial.Baranenko, p. 63 In February 1917 Nikolas II renounced the throne. Until June 1918 the College was under the Commission for Social Help of the Petrograd Labor Commune and on June 14 it was moved to the Commission on Public Education of the Northern Labor Commune. It was said that that year the College seized its existence, but the St. Petersburg Central Historical Archives have documents citing admissions in 1919, 1920 and 1924. = University of Refrigeration and Food Processing Technologies = 1931 ‚Äì 1941  In 1931, the Council of People's Commissars of USSR opened in the College's former building a Leningrad Teaching Mechanics and Technology Refrigeration Plant. It took over the building erected in 1871 for the 100th anniversary of the Commercial College. Over 440 students started classes in the fall of 1931.From College to University, p. 58 In pre-revolutionary Russia, several institutes taught classes for the specialists in refrigeration, including St. Petersburg Technical Institute, St. Petersburg Polytechnic, Kiev Polytechnic and Tomsk Polytechnic Institutes, Imperial Technical College and St. Petersburg Imperial Commercial College. In 1930, some 100 specialists graduated in USSR. An important role in the establishment of the Mechanics and Technology Refrigeration Plant was played by Anastas Mikoyan. The new college united the institute and rabfak, a preparatory department for workers. In 1934 rabfak and the institute became separate entities, and the college was renamed the Leningrad Institute of Refrigeration.From College to University, p. 59 In 1938 it also started training specialists in dairy processing.From College to University, p. 60  1941 ‚Äì 1945  On June 24, 1941, a group of students was sent to build an air strip. The next day, a mobile unit was formed to fight saboteurs and four days later it joined the Frunze volunteer brigade. The Institute housed the headquarters for the 1st Infantry Regiment, 3rd Division of the People's Militia of the Frunze District. During the war, students and instructors dug trenches, fought on the front lines and protected the building from lighting bombs and shells. The institute developed synthetic fuel for tanks and for engines in low temperatures, isothermal container for transporting blood, refrigeration unit for testing samples of military equipment, soy milk production and fish canning, flour substitutions. In 1942 it was evacuated to Kislovodsk, then to Semipalatinsk, where it stayed till 1944. Classes continued during the war. Between 1941 and 1947, some 1,462 engineers graduated.  1945 ‚Äì 2011  The building today The boost of food processing during the Stalin years led to high demand in the new equipment for meat, dairy, fish and other industries.Guide to go to college, p. 5 Also, the university's refrigeration units were used for freezing the soil when building tunnels for Moscow and Leningrad Metro. In 1947 Mechanics and Technology Refrigeration Plant and the Leningrad Chemical and Technology Institute of Dairy Processing were united into the Leningrad Institute of Refrigeration and Dairy Processing. It was formed with two departments: mechanical and technological. In 1949 it they were joined by the Refrigeration Department. In 1953 the institute was renamed Leningrad Technological Institute of Refrigeration. From 1957 to 1993 it had an evening school, and from 1966 offered a correspondence course. In 1975 three departments were added: refrigeration equipment, cryo equipment and air conditioning. In 1980 the departments of cryo equipment and air conditioning were united into one. In 1991 the institute was renamed St. Petersburg Red Banner Technological Institute of Refrigeration, and in 1993 ‚Äì St. Petersburg Technological Institute of Refrigeration. In 1994 it became St. Petersburg State Academy of Refrigeration and Food Processing and in 1999 it became St. Petersburg State University of Low-Temperature and Food Processing Technologies.From College to University, p. 61 ; Educational Process In 1997 the college started training specialists in meat processing and in 2002 got the license to teach Food Biotechnologies and Environmental Protection and Resources Management. The results of its research were used in constructing Krasnoyarsk Dam, Sayano- Shushenskaya Dam and Angara hydroelectric plants.Professors, p. 30 In 2003 it was one of the most in-demand colleges with 2,14 people per place. It had over 170 contracts with companies in St. Petersburg, Leningrad region and other regions. Students interned at Baltika Brewing Company, Norilsk Nickel, BSH Hausger√§te, several meat-packing plant like Parnas-M, and others.From College to University, p. 70 In 2011 it had over 6,500 students. During the 80 years of its existence it trained over 43,000 specialists. = Merging with ITMO University = President Vladimir Putin, in his order on May 7, 2012, started a college reform where certain colleges were merged to improve their effectiveness. Thus on Aug. 18, 2011, the university joined with ITMO University, and all the students, with their approval, transferred to ITMO. Originally the college kept its departments and was named the Institute of Refrigeration and Biotechnologies. The Institute's rector received the position of a director, and the Institute was largely autonomous. On Oct. 1, 2014 at the VII St. Petersburg Innovations Forum the agreement was signed between ITMO University and United Elements Engineering and on Sept. 24, the Institute opened a department specializing in industrial climate equipment. In 2015, the institute's departments of cryogenic technologies and refrigeration and of refrigeration equipment were transformed into ITMO University's Department of Cryogenic Techniques and Air Conditioning and Department of Food Biotechnologies and Engineering. The Institute in its previous form seized its existence.

He works mainly in charcoal and his drawings highlight figurative objects in general and the human body in particular.Art-to-Art Palette 08/2013, p. 1-4  Life = Career and artistic influence = Weary Traveller (2014) Dan Pyle was born in Wolf Point, Montana, and grew up in Washington state. Dan Pyle has been drawing since his childhood and was awarded for his works early on. However, his artistic career began as a dancer with the Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle, and was substantially influenced by his admiration for black and white photography. This cross fertilization is where his specific artistic style developed.Art Galleries Los Angeles, Artist Interview 2014 Moreover, Pyle‚Äôs work is marked by contrasts and the special light of a Jan Vermeer and a William Turner. Thematically, the human body with its muscles, shapes and movements are at the forefront of his work, which he is able to present authentically and expressively as a former ballet dancer.Art of Man, edition 16 dated January 24, 2014, p. 30 After moving to California, Dan Pyle settled in West Hollywood, developing his detailed technique with new and unconventional materials.Art Galleries Los Angeles, Artist Interview 2014 = Style and techniques = Lost in the Moment (2008) Pyle's media initially include paintings in oil and acrylic, and, during a later period, murals for public spaces. After several phases, in which he also experimented with ink and pencil, as well as pastels and watercolors, Pyle finally found charcoal as the medium of his choice.Art-to-Art Palette 08/2013 In addition to focusing on the human body there are unexpected and aged objects that he transforms into his charcoal compositions. So, in addition to living figures, old teapots to rusted motorcycles become his models to which he gives a new identity through the use of contrast, negative space and isolation. The anonymity that his art is reflecting are subject and intention at the same time.Art Galleries Los Angeles, Artist interview 2014 Crushed (2014) Pyle's technique with shadows and light seems to make the presence of color superfluous. So only a few of his works show deliberately weak color characteristics.Art-to-Art Palette 08/2013 Even in his current phase, the artist shows himself adventurous and works, e.g., with formats on wood. The substrate with its idiosyncratic structures gives his drawings an additional dimension.Art Galleries Los Angeles, Artist Interview 2014 When editing his works Pyle aims to include negative space which isolates the subject of the drawing. His original compositions are already in his mind's eye, and the photography helps Pyle to capture the exact vision that he wants to realize. By avoiding a final photographic sharpness, Pyle's work breaks away from photorealism and takes on its own interpretation of modern realism.Scott Brassart, in: The Bottom Line Magazine, Palm Springs 2008 = Exhibitions = Dan Pyle's works are exhibited primarily in the US and increasingly in Europe. With 23 images, the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas owns one of the largest private collections.Art-to-Art Palette 08/2013 Other exhibitions were held in West Hollywood, Palm Springs, Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, Hollywood, Santa Ana, Long Beach, Provincetown and New York, and now also in Asia.Art of Man, edition 16 dated January 24, 2014, p. 27 file:Dan PYLE_In Pursuit of Freedom (1).jpgIn Pursuit of Freedom (1) (2009) file:Dan PYLE_In Pursuit of Freedom (2).jpgIn Pursuit of Freedom (2) (2009) file:Dan PYLE_In Pursuit of Freedom (3).jpgIn Pursuit of Freedom (3) (2009)  Honors and awards (selection)  * 2015 Still Point Art Quarterly ‚Äì Chasing the Light (finding the shadow) ‚Äì Best Drawing for \\"Shadows\\" * 2014 American Art Awards ‚Äì 1st place, Still Life category for \\"Weary Traveler\\" * 2013 American Art Awards ‚Äì 1st place, charcoal, for \\"In Pursuit Of Freedom\\" * 2012 American Art Awards ‚Äì tied 1st place for \\"Predicament\\" in charcoal category * 2011 1st Prize winner ‚Äì LarkGalleryOnline ‚Äì The Rediscovery of Wonder, for \\"Silver Lining\\" & \\"The Accuser\\"  Bibliography  * 2015 Art Exhibeo Magazine ‚Äì Dan Pyle: Time for you and Time for me * 2015 Still Point Art Quarterly ‚Äì spring issue * 2014 Artist Portfolio Magazine Issue 17, pages 55‚Äì56 * 2014 Important World Artists, Vol. 1 * 2014 Hidden Treasures Art Magazine, yearbook 2014 * 2014 Art of Man magazine #16 ‚Äì interview 10 pages * 2014 Drawing Magazine ‚Äì spring issue ‚Äì interview, 2nd prize winner * 2013 Art to Art Palette Journal ‚Äì \\"Simple is Beautiful\\", Portrait of Dan Pyle * 2013 Artist Portfolio Magazine, anniversary issue 2 page spread * 2013 Artist Portfolio Magazine, portraits issue, full page feature * 2013 Artist Portfolio Magazine, winter 2 page spread * 2013 Still Point Arts Quarterly, ‚ÄòEveryday Objects‚Äô, Spring issue * 2012 Strokes of Genius V: The Best of Drawing‚Äîreleasing Oct. 2013 * 2012 Wisdom Crieth Without (magazine) ‚Äì Nov./Dec. issue, full page * 2012 Still Point Arts Quarterly, Summer 2012 Issue No. 6 ‚Äì Still Point IV exhibition winners * 2011 ‚Äì International Dictionary of Artist ‚Äì World Wide Art Books * 2008 Scott Brassart, in: Bottom Line Magazine, April Vol. 27, Issue 16  External links  * Website of Dan Pyle * Short profile * Dan Pyle at work References Category:1954 births Category:20th-century American painters Category:American male painters Category:21st-century American painters Category:21st-century male artists Category:American contemporary artists Category:Realism (art movement) Category:Living people Category:Artists from Montana Category:People from Wolf Point, Montana Category:Artists from Washington (state) ","title":"Dan Pyle"},{"id":"49127974","text":"\\"Meeseeks and Destroy\\" is the fifth episode of the first season of Rick and Morty. It premiered on Adult Swim on January 20, 2014. The episode was written by Ryan Ridley and directed by Bryan Newton. In the episode, Rick provides the family with a solution to their problems, freeing him up to go on an adventure led by Morty. The episode has been well received, and was seen by about 1.6 million viewers when it was first aired on Adult Swim.  Plot  After a particularly traumatic adventure, Morty strikes a bet with Rick to lead his own adventure. When the rest of the Smith family asks Rick for solutions to several mundane problems, he gives them a Meeseeks Box, a gadget capable of summoning blue humanoids named \\"Mr. Meeseeks\\". These creatures live in pain until they execute the first order they are given; once it is completed they vanish. Rick warns the family to keep their tasks simple. Jerry summons a Meeseeks and asks it to help him take two strokes off his golf game, but despite its coaching he struggles to improve. Since a Meeseeks cannot die until it completes its task, it summons another Meeseeks to help. Soon Jerry is surrounded by many desperate Meeseeks. Jerry and Beth, exasperated, go to dinner together in spite of the Meeseeks' protests. All the Meeseeks blame each other for their predicament and fight over the correct solution, concluding that their only hope is to take all the strokes off Jerry's golf game by killing him. A horde of armed Meeseeks descends upon the restaurant and takes hostages to coerce Jerry to come out. Jerry almost gives in, but Beth inspires him and encourages him to try his golf swing one last time. Jerry uses a severed piece of shelving and a tomato to show that his game has improved, and the delighted Meeseeks all cease to exist. Morty and Rick arrive in a medieval fantasy world to begin their adventure. They stop at a poor village that requests their help to steal a giant's treasure in order to raise money. Morty and Rick climb up a giant beanstalk to the giants' world, but an accident sees them arrested for murdering a giant. They are tried in a Giant's Court, but are acquitted through a technicality. The heroes stop at a tavern for a drink, where Morty confronts Rick over his negativity before heading to the bathroom. There, he meets Mr. Jellybean, an at first friendly character who tries to rape him. Morty fights him off but is visibly shaken. Meanwhile, Rick is beginning to enjoy himself, winning a sizable amount of money from playing cards. Morty begs Rick to go home, and admits to losing the bet. Rick sees a battered Mr. Jellybean leaving the bathroom and, realizing what happened, raises Morty's spirits by giving his winnings to the poor villagers. The villagers declare Rick and Morty heroes and ask them to stay and meet their king: Mr. Jellybean. Morty quickly convinces Rick to open a portal to leave; Rick does so, then shoots through it and kills Jellybean. In a post- credits scene, two of the villagers find incriminating photographs in King Jellybean's lockbox, but they burn it to keep the king's legacy untainted.  Development  Justin Roiland claimed the idea for the episode occurred when, frustrated with the progress of a writing session, he suggested the introduction of a character blurting \\"I'm Mister Meeseeks, look at me!\\" and the concept evolved from there.  Reception  Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club rated the episode A-, quoting that it \\"[may have had] the most weirdly upbeat ending of the show so far\\". David Roa from Dead Screen gave the episode 9.1 out of 10, noting its great story and re-watchability. Junkie Monkey's gave it a mixed review, stating that although it wasn't the best episode of the season, it was far from the worst. Den of Geek gave the episode a 5/5 rating, reviewer Joe Matar said that the episode was a good challenge of the concept of adventure.

He began his career in the 1960s by mixing live sound at the Electric Factory. There he mixed many leading acts, including Cream, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Moby Grape, Ten Years After, BB King, Moody Blues, Buddy Guy, Grateful Dead, Hot Tuna, Procol Harum, The Chambers Brothers, Frank Zappa, and Janis Joplin. He began his recording career at Regent Sound Studios in Philadelphia, and later joined Regent's New York facility. There he expanded his knowledge, learning of studio and console design, disc cutting, studio recording, mixing and management. After two years at Regent he moved to the Hit Factory Recording Studios as chief recording engineer, where he engineered successful recordings by James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Carly Simon, Barry Manilow, and Dionne Warwick & The Spinners, among others. Hits he worked on included the album Barry Manilow II (US No. 9), and its US No. 1 single \\"Mandy\\"; Warwick & The Spinners' 1974 single \\"Then Came You\\" (US No. 1) (produced by Thom Bell), plus Carly Simon's Hotcakes album (US No. 3), and her single \\"Mockingbird\\" (US No. 5). Maslin's career as a producer began at The Hit Factory, with the co- production of Bonnie Raitt's Streetlights album, he then moved to the Record Plant. =Bowie, Rollers and Air Supply= From August to December 1974 David Bowie recorded his new Philly soul-inspired album at Philadelphia's Sigma Sound and New York's Record Plant. Producer Tony Visconti returned to London to mix the recordings, but Bowie took an opportunity to collaborate with John Lennon. Bowie called Maslin and asked the young engineer to produce. In January 1975 at Electric Lady studios Maslin oversaw the recording of \\"Fame\\" with Lennon on guest vocals, as well as a cover of Lennon's own song \\"Across the Universe\\". These sessions completed the hit album Young Americans. This album reached UK No. 2, US No. 9, and the single \\"Fame\\" was US No. 1. Bowie asked Maslin to produce his next album, Station to Station, in Los Angeles in 1975.https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie- brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ The album was a critical and commercial success, charting at US No. 3 and UK No. 5, and included the singles ‚ÄúGolden Years‚Äù and ‚ÄúTVC15‚Äù. Maslin rejoined the Hit Factory, and was next contacted by the renowned Clive Davis to produce two chart topper albums for the Bay City Rollers (including the 1977 hit single \\"You Made Me Believe in Magic\\" ), \\"Don't Cry Out Loud\\" a signature hit for Melissa Manchester in 1978, and an album for Eric Carmen in 1980.

He was called back to produce the following two multi-platinum albums for Air Supply. Highlighted by five Top Five singles in a row \\"Even The Nights Are Better\\", \\"Every Woman In The World\\", \\"Here I Am\\", \\"Sweet Dreams\\", and \\"The One That You Love\\", making Air Supply the most successful pop group of all time. Air Supply's greatest hits compilation album has sold beyond the four times platinum mark. =Los Angeles= In 1983 Maslin opened his own studio, Image Recording Studios in Hollywood.

The name Adrasan, also known as Cavuskoy (√áavu≈ük√∂y in Turkish - \\"Cavus\\" means sergeant and \\"koy\\" means bay), comes from the Greek name Erdassa. The Bay of Adrasan extends along more than 2.5 km of Turkey's southern coast. The bay includes the town of Adrasan, in addition to smaller villages and hamlets. The town (3-5 kilometers form the bay) offers a couple of local bars, a post office, small shops and an open-air market. Adrasan Bay is a naturally protected area, surrounded by a national park with pine forests, Taurus Mountains, blue water lagoons and sandy beaches. It is perfect for water sports and various outdoor activities, such as hiking, trekking, snorkeling, diving and deep sea fishing. In July 2015, a forest fire erupted near the Adrasan Beach. No loss of life was reported. However, around 125 hectares of forestland was burned, affecting the junction of the Lycian Way, the beach road and the slopes of the mountains. All the trekking routes have since been restored and are traversable for hikers. All of the site's tourist facilities have remained open. The most popular way to get to Adrasan Bay is either by rental car, private transfer, taxi, public bus or shuttle bus ‚Äì from Antalya airport (about 1.5 ‚Äì 2 hours journey) or simply by using a mini bus ( dolmu≈ü in Turkish) that travels to and from Kemer, Kumluca and other nearby towns. It is quiet area, free of all the big-city noise, pollution and most common stressors of everyday life. Sandy beaches, blue lagoons and picturesque views from the Markiz Hill, located just at the entry of the Bay make Adrasan Bay an ideal place to collect positive energy from the sun, enjoy fresh air and enjoy the overwhelming smell of the pine trees combined with citrus groves.

Her collection is focused on the work of Russian artists of several generations, living both in the home country and in the West; and the first √©migr√©s generation associated with the School of Paris. Career Stolyarova's collection, Flying in the Wake of Light, collected during the last decade, and not all the Russian artists included are products of Soviet soil. Many are √©migr√©s or children of √©migr√©s, like the formidable Pierre Dmitrienko (1925‚Äì1974), with a biographical background that is more Montparnasse than Arbat. Yet the animating genius of the whole is nonetheless a distinctly Russian spirit that, as the Evangelist said, bloweth where it listeth, evidently, even in the desolation of the Soviet epoch. That cogency of purpose is what makes this private collection remarkable; indeed, this is what makes it a private art collection ‚Äì in the same qualitative, if not quantitative, sense as those built by the Fricks and the Mellons of yesteryear ‚Äì rather than a selection of pictures decorating the walls of a private house. Russian art critic Alexander Rappaport, who has contributed one of the essays to Flying in the Wake of Light, wrote: > ¬´I see at least three aspects that put a small private collection in an > advantageous position vis-√†-vis large-scale projects and institutions. The > first one concerns the new critical numbness in front of a work of art. In > different instances the reasons for this silence could be different, but the > silence itself seems very symptomatic. In the case of private collections > such silence is incongruous, and here we have none of the deafening silence > that accompanies portentous suggestiveness of major events.

Bowlt: \\"The painters represented in the collection of Irina Stoliarova document that alternative tradition, reminding us of the forthright vision, moral courage and artistic integrity of that counter-movement ‚Äì and of the fact that, in order for any culture to withstand and survive the verdict of ages, it must retain intrinsic values which transcend the immediate social and political perimeters of its particular time and place. The spontaneity, artistry, and mystery of this pictorial polyphony demonstrate that its creators possessed these constant values and that they did, indeed, move beyond their Soviet roots to become an organic part of the contemporary global process. In this respect, the Stoliarova collection is not merely a casual assemblage of various artifacts, but a single celebration of private initiative and the total freedom of aesthetic expression ‚Äî ‚ÄúFreedom is freedom‚Äù, as the poet Vsevolod Nekrasov wrote A. Borovsky: \\"The Stolyarova's collection has been focused on the work of Russian artists of several generations, living both in the home country and in the West; and the first √©migr√©s generation associated with the School of Paris. The √©migr√© artists in the collection include those who worked in the early post-war decades; many of them were then expressing their individuality in an entirely different way. Irina Stolyarova, however, and it is important to say, is completely indifferent to the political aspects of the artist‚Äôs residence. For her, an artist is ‚ÄòRussian‚Äô in the broadest sense, to be viewed within a European cultural context. At least, in choosing her artists, she is referencing this European paradigm. I would further say that Irina Stolyarova is not concerned with a conceptual and even less so with a narrative content of a work. The primary object of her interest is painting as a material substance. She is in interested in painting as such, in its entire gamut: all the way from figurative representation to abstract. Her forte is navigating in this material substance of painting moving from ‚Äúrepresentational density‚Äù (the concept of art theorist Yury Tynyanov) to the free-spirited expressions of various forms of abstraction\\".

Written by series creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland, and directed by Justin Roiland, the episode premiered on Adult Swim on December 2, 2013. The series introduces protagonists, alcoholic scientist Rick Sanchez and his innocent teenage grandson Morty Smith, as they embark on a dangerous interdimensional adventure to fetch Mega tree seeds. The pilot had a mixed to positive reception and was seen by about 1.1 million viewers when airing.  Plot  Rick establishes himself as a bad influence on his grandson Morty when it is discovered that Morty has missed a semester of school in the time he's spent on adventures with Rick. Rick takes Morty to another dimension, known as Dimension 35-C, which has the perfect conditions for growing \\"Mega Trees\\", which bear \\"Mega Fruit\\" holding \\"Mega Seeds\\", which Rick requires for his research. In order to get past intergalactic customs, Morty hides the Mega Tree seeds in his rectum, but when their cover is blown, Rick and Morty escape while engaging in a shootout with bureaucratic alien insects. Ultimately, the seeds are used to briefly make Morty highly intelligent, causing his parents to believe he is fine with his education and let Rick stay. But the seeds' energy is wasted with Morty writhing from the aftereffects as Rick informs his grandson that they need to go back and get more before going into a nonsensical rant that they'll be going on a lot more crazy adventures.  Reception  Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ rating, stating that \\"[the viewer is] never allowed to forget the dark implications of Rick‚Äôs ambitions. Which means there are still stakes, which makes the jokes funnier and keeps the stories interesting.\\" ScreenRant's Jason Tabrys was overall positive in his review of the episode, drawing comparisons to Doctor Who and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, some of Harmon's inspirations.

It was first published in 1846. It was popular for half a century in the Victorian era, running through 29 London editions by 1896. It was also published in America. The book offered elaborate dishes, described with French terminology such as bisque, entr√©es, entremets, vol-au- vent, timbale and souffl√©. It included bills of fare for meals for up to 300 people, and for a series of eight- or nine-course dinners served to Queen Victoria; one exceptional royal dinner in 1841 had sixteen entr√©es and sixteen entremets, including truffles in Champagne. The Modern Cook was the first to mention filling wafer cones with ice cream. The book, written for upper middle-class housewives, is illustrated with 60 engravings, often showing how to present carefully decorated centrepiece dishes such as \\"Salmon √† la Chambord\\" for large dinner parties. The book influenced households in Britain and America to aspire to more complex, French-style dinners in imitation of the Queen, and resulted in a change in eating habits, including the modern two-course approach for both lunch and dinner. Context Charles Elm√© Francatelli, from an Italian family, was born in London in 1805, and learnt cookery in France. Coming to England, he worked for various aristocrats before becoming chief chef of Crockford's club and then chief cook to Queen Victoria in 1840.Account books of the Lord Steward of the Royal Household for 1840-42, National Archive, Kew, refs. LS 2/66, LS 2/67 and LS 2/68 He went on to work at Crockford's again, at the Coventry House and Reform Clubs, St James's Hotel, and for the Prince and Princess of Wales.Colin Smythe, \\"Charles Elm√© Francatelli, Crockford's and the Royal Connection\\" in Petits Propos Culinaires 101 (2014), pp. 42‚Äì67, and \\"Charles Elm√© Francatelli, Additions & Supplementations\\" in Petits Propos Culinaires 102 (2015), pp. 100‚Äì118 This made him a celebrity cook of his time. Book=Approach= \\"Salmis of Partridges with Aspic Jelly\\" Apart from the preface and Francatelli's advice on serving wine, the body of the book consists almost entirely of recipes without any kind of introduction. There is no guidance on choice of kitchenware or advice on the layout of the kitchen. The recipes are presented entirely as instructions, generally without illustration. Quantities, where stated, are incorporated in the text; ingredients are never listed explicitly. Quantities are sometimes named, as in the \\"Cream Bechamel Sauce\\", which begins \\"Put six ounces of fresh butter into a middle-sized stewpan; add four ounces of sifted flour, some nutmeg, a few peppercorns, and a little salt;\\". In other cases only the relative proportions are indicated, as for the \\"Salmis of Partridges with Aspic Jelly\\", where the only hint of quantity in the recipe is \\"must be mixed with one-third of its quantity of aspic jelly\\". This recipe also indicates the style of cross-referencing, with the starting instruction \\"Prepare the salmis as directed in No. 1078\\". \\"Iced Pudding √† la Chesterfield\\", showing cones around the base filled with pineapple ice cream, making this the first printed source for ice cream cones The Modern Cook is the first published record in England of filling wafer cornets, which Francatelli called gauffres, with ice cream. He used them to garnish his iced puddings. =Contents= The following apply to the 28th edition of 1886.

There is a full-page frontispiece of the author, drawn by Auguste Hervieu and engraved by Samuel Freeman (1773‚Äì1857). Freeman is known for working mainly in stipple, and the portrait here is no exception. All the other engravings are of completed dishes, showing the serving-plate with the food arranged on it and often elaborately garnished. The artists and engravers of the food illustrations are not identified. =Bills of fare= A Bill of Fare for a dinner for 6 persons Francatelli provides \\"A Series of Bills of Fare for Every Month Throughout the Year\\", including dinners variously for 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 16, 18, 20, 24, 28 and 36 persons (though not all of these in every month). The bills of fare for dinners for 6 persons thus represent the simplest menus in the book. All the dinners are divided into a first and a second \\"Course\\", but each course was divided in turn into three or four servings, in most cases with a choice of two or more dishes. Thus there might be one or two soups, two fishes, two \\"removes\\" of meat, and two savoury \\"entr√©es\\" in the first \\"Course\\", with a second \\"Course\\" of one kind of game, followed by a choice of three \\"entremets\\" which included both savouries, generally vegetables, and desserts. There is a single bill of fare for a \\"Ball Supper for 300 Persons\\", and one for a \\"Public Dinner\\" for the same number. A Bill of Fare for a dinner for Her Majesty Queen Victoria There are 13 bills of fare for \\"Her Majesty's Dinner\\", each with an exact date in 1841 and the words \\"(Under the control of C. Francatelli.)\\". Each of the royal dinners has either eight or nine courses (including a buffet or sideboard), except for that of 30 June which is divided into two \\"Services\\" and has 11 courses. The royal dinners are described almost entirely in French, with the exception of the heading, the phrase \\"Side Board\\", and a few specifically British dishes such as \\"Roast Mutton\\" and \\"Haunch of Venison\\". There are usually two soups, two fishes, two removes, six entr√©es, two roasts, two more removes, six entremets, and between two and seven dishes on the sideboard. The exceptional royal dinner of 30 June 1841 had sixteen entr√©es and sixteen entremets. Some of these entremets used the most costly ingredients, including truffles in Champagne. =Publication= The Modern Cook was first published in 1846. It reached its 29th edition in 1896. Francatelli presented a copy of the 8th edition to Queen Victoria on 4 June 1853. Editions included: * 1846, First edition.

The book further argues that \\"this is the result of science‚Äîthis the height of art. It produces, with such elaborate forms and majestic ceremonies, an aspic jelly without aspic, that, exhausted in the effort, it can proceed no further, and seems to think that here at last, in this supreme sauce, we have a sure resting-place‚Äîthe true blessedness‚Äîthe ewigkeit.\\" George H. Ellwanger wrote in his Pleasures of the Table in 1902 that Francatelli's Modern Cook was \\"still a superior treatise, and although little adapted to the average household, it will well repay careful study on the part of the expert amateur. 'The palate is as capable and nearly as worthy of education as the eye and the ear,' says Francatelli ‚Äî a statement which his volume abundantly bears out.\\" He added that \\"one sees, accordingly, an ornate observance of decoration in his grand army of side-dishes. These are excellent throughout, but generally very elaborate, while his sauces and recipes for pastry are especially good. The same may be said of his quenelles and timbales. A competent hand will find his work a valuable guide from which to obtain ideas; it is not a practical book for the majority.\\" The New Zealand Herald of 1912 commented that Francatelli was \\"an earnest and gifted worker in the cause of gastronomy\\" and that The Modern Cook faithfully reflected Victorian dining habits. \\"Everything was good and solid of its kind, even if tending towards complication rather than simplicity.\\" The review opined that the great joints of meat \\"decorated with their silver hatelet skewers bearing cock's combs and trufflets, were attended by the most appetizing ragouts and garnishes.\\" Despite the gloss, there was \\"nothing meretricious or deceptive in the savoury promises held out by Victorian comestibles.\\" The reviewer notes, however, that even while Francatelli was describing this elaborate fare, the \\"excessive meat-eating\\" was being replaced by a diet richer in vegetables, and meals were becoming simpler, so that \\"now, in the 20th century, much that Francatelli wrote about ... is no longer needed.\\" =Modern= M. F. K. Fisher, writing in The New York Times, stated that millions of American women in the 19th century organised \\"every aspect of their lives .. as much as possible in imitation of the Queen\\", and that The Modern Cook sold almost as well in America as it did in England. Admitting that few American kitchens could \\"follow all its directions for the light Gallic dainties Francatelli introduced to counteract the basic heaviness of royal dining habits\\", she argued that all the same his two-course approach eventually shaped the way Americans now eat both lunch and dinner. She observed that at Windsor Castle, Francatelli and other royal chefs were assisted by 24 assistant chefs and two \\"Yeomen of the Kitchen\\", not to mention a multitude of \\"servers and lackeys\\". This did not deter American housewives \\"as far west as Iowa and then beyond\\" from doing their best to follow his instructions. The Historic Food website notes that Francatelli provides two recipes for mincemeat, one with roast beef, the other containing lemons but no meat. C. Anne Wilson, introducing Women and Victorian Values, 1837‚Äì1910. Advice Books, Manuals and Journals for Women, states that Francatelli was writing for the \\"upper middle-class housewife\\" in The Modern Cook, explaining to her how to serve the \\"socially important\\" dinner in English, French and \\"√† la Russe\\" styles. In contrast, his 1861 Cook's Guide is for \\"more ordinary\\" households, advocating \\"traditional two-course dinners\\". Nick Baines writes on LoveFood that Francatelli included \\"a whole collection of lavish pies\\" in the book. Panikos Panayi, in his book Spicing Up Britain, writes that Francatelli's book for the middle classes definitely recognised differences between British and foreign foods, even in its full title which ran \\"...Comprising, in Addition to English Cookery, the Most Advanced and Recherch√© Systems of French, Italian and German Cookery\\". Panayi notes that Francatelli's preface to the first edition was scathing about ignorant \\"English writers on gastronomy\\", comparing them unfavourably to the \\"great Professors\\" of cuisine in France. Panayi observes further that while most of Francatelli's chapters are not grouped by national origin, he does distinguish English, Foreign, and Italian soups. He notes that it would have taken years to eat all the dishes listed, and that it is impossible to tell how often middle-class families may have eaten \\"fillets of haddocks, √† la royale\\". He considers it likely that only the wealthiest could have aspired to eat the sort of food described by Francatelli, but concedes that his bills of fare for dinners for six persons (by month) do indicate that the middle classes could afford the best meat and vegetables, and indeed that they had domestic staff able to prepare dinners of that complexity described in Francatelli's French terminology. Panayi concludes that Francatelli represents \\"perhaps the most extreme example\\" of the nineteenth-century British habit of giving dishes French descriptions.

History  The story of the founding of Yakcheonsa Temple is unknown as there are no remaining records. During the Unified Silla era, there was a big international temple called Beophwasa located halfway up Mt. Hallasan, which is not far from the temple, and its associated hermitages would have been scattered nearby. Yakcheonsa Temple is located on a site where a mineral water spring flows from the ground year round. Long before 1982, when the temple was established, Yaksuam Hermitage was located there. According to some records, Ven. Bang Donghwa stayed at the hermitage in the Jungmun area for a while to recover his health after he was released from prison. He was imprisoned in 1918 because of his involvement with the anti-Japanese independence movement initiated by the Jejudo religious community. For centuries, locals in the region had called the site of the spring ‚ÄúDwaeksaemi,‚Äù a Jejudo word meaning ‚Äúa mineral spring with good quality water.‚Äù According to another story, in the 1960s, a Confucian scholar named Kim Hyeong-gon was praying for 100 days in a small cave. He drank some mineral water given to him in a dream and recovered his health. He then built Yaksuam to express his gratitude to the Buddha and did his Buddhist practice there until the end of his life. Architecture Before Ven. Hyein built Yakcheonsa, the site was occupied by Yaksuam, a thatched roof hermitage in the traditional architectural style of Jejudo. It was a modest 59 square meters (640 square feet) building that stood on 1,490 square meters (16,010 square feet) of land. Full-scale construction on Yakcheonsa began in 1982, and the 30 meter (98 feet) high Daejeok-gwangjeon was built to include a basement. Then a three-story dormitory, also with a basement, was built with passageways that connect to Daejeok-gwangjeon. That dormitory also has a dining hall and concession stand that sells basic necessities. Eventually, an underground Dharma hall, a Samseonggak, a pagoda to enshrine relics, large fountains and a pond were also added. Yakcheonsa is now an iconic Jejudo temple. Korea's largest Vairocana Buddha and 18,000 small Buddhas are enshrined in Yakcheonsa's Dharma hall, and its temple bell weighs 18,000 kilos (39,680 pounds). They seem to reflect the past glory of the temple that once stood on this site. It is said that the mineral water spring washes away the suffering and tears of sentient beings, and that is why Yakcheonsa Temple was built here. The temple also enshrines the spirit tablets of past royalty such as King Munjong and his wife Queen Hyeondeok, King Yeongchinwang and his wife Lady Yi Bang-ja. Similar to other Buddhist temples in South Korea, Yakcheonsa has facilities for lay brethren to stay, eat, and meditate, in addition to participating in Buddhist rituals.  Tourism  It also offers temple stay programs where visitors can experience Buddhist culture.

History  Beomnyunsa Temple (Korean: Î≤ïÎ•úÏÇ¨, Chinese: Ê≥ïËº™ÂØ∫, also Beopryunsa, Pronounced ‚ÄúBeom-nyun-sa‚Äù) was established by Ven. Sangnyun (aka. Muadang) in 2005. While Sangnyun was practicing at Seunggasa Temple on Mt. Samgaksan (now called Mt. Bukhansan) in Seoul in 1996, she saw Avalokit√™≈õvara (Bodhisattva of Compassion) in her dream, and then established Beomnyunsa Temple in the foothills of Mt. Munsusan in Yongin City. The terrain around Beomnyunsa brings to mind hermit sages immersed in meditation and surrounded by beautiful lotus flowers. On this auspicious site, the temple's structures were built from red pine logged on Baekdusan Mountain in North Korea, and Buddha statues were carved from hwangdeungseok (a type of granite) from Iksan. Beomnyunsa Temple is magnificent due to its size and artistic qualities. Especially noteworthy is the Main Buddha Hall, built in the unusual shape of the Chinese character ‚Äú‰∫û,‚Äù and the main Buddha statue which is three times as big as the one in Seokguram Grotto. Ven. Sangnyun said her only wish was that the temple remain for a long time as a precious cultural heritage of Korea. Now more than ten years since its establishment, the temple is recognized as a major place dedicated to Avalokit√™≈õvara and attracts many visitors. Its operational principle is clearly expressed in the phrase ‚ÄúBeomnyunsa Temple, overflowing with compassion and happiness,‚Äù and as it becomes known to a wider public day by day, it is growing into a temple where devotees can study together and share the joy of the Dharma.  Cultural properties  In front of the temple's Gwaneumjeon Hall stands its only designated cultural property, the Three-Story Stone Pagoda of Beomnyunsa Temple (Cultural Heritage Material of Gyeonggido, No. 145). The pagoda originally stood at the house of Mr. Lee Deok-mun in Guro-dong, Seoul, who donated it and moved it to the temple. Although its year of production is not clearly known, it seems to be in the style of the Unified Silla era.  Tourism  Around Beomnyunsa Temple are concentrated some of the biggest entertainment facilities in Korea, including a Korean Folk Village, Everland Resort and Hantaek Botanical Garden, all of which can be reached in 30 minutes by car from the temple. Established in Giheung, Yongin City in 1974, the Korean Folk Village is a tourist attraction featuring traditional Korean culture where visitors can see and experience the way people lived in the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). It also offers temple stay programs where visitors can experience Buddhist culture.Beomnyunsa Temple stay program  Gallery  file:Î≤ïÎ•úÏÇ¨1.jpg file:Î≤ïÎ•úÏÇ¨2.jpg file:Î≤ïÎ•úÏÇ¨3.jpg  References External links * Beomnyunsa official website(in English) Category:Buddhist temples of the Jogye Order Category:Buddhist temples in South Korea ","title":"Beomnyunsa"},{"id":"49129017","text":"Men's Football at the 2016 South Asian Games was held in Guwahati, India from February 6 to February 15, 2016.

It aired on October 21, 2015 on American Broadcasting Company (ABC). The episode is directed by Alisa Statman and written by Chuck Tathum. Plot Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) tells Jay (Ed O'Neill) that she got selected in a jury duty. But in the audience court, her behavior causes her to get expelled and removes her from being a juror. In Gloria's absence, Jay has no choice but to be a volunteer parent at Joe's (Jeremy Maguire) preschool. He has a hard time to adjust himself, especially when a little boy calls him old man, causing him to criticize him about his big ears. Jay also has the feeling that Joe totally ignores him until, at the end of the day, Joe asks him to come the next day. Jay is glad to have been noticed by his son. Since Jay can't come to work, it's Claire (Julie Bowen) who has the company in her hands for the day. By a coincidence, it's also the day where parents are allowed to bring their daughters at work. Claire seizes the opportunity by taking Haley (Sarah Hyland) and Alex (Ariel Winter) to her place. However, Claire suffers from a lot of bad luck as each time she tries to make the right decision, only to see things worsen. Claire tries to show her daughters that she can control everything, but when she mistakes one employee who retires for one another, because they've the same names, she gives-up. Haley and Alex reassure her, telling her that she is their mom and they know she manage to do a good job in this part of her life. Meanwhile, Phil (Ty Burrell) accompanies Luke (Nolan Gould) and Manny (Rico Rodriguez) classes in Community Service. A man (Kevin Chamberlin) who knows Phil approaches him and asks him to give him some money since he left his wallet and his phone in his car. Phil agrees but can't remember where he met this man who seems to know him a lot. This causes him to be torn between Manny who says that he made a good deed and Luke who believes his dad had been scammed. Phil eventually rallies on Luke's side and, with help of the teenagers (save Manny) throws garbage in the man's car, only to learn that this man is actually the obstetrician who helped with Luke's birth. Mitch (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) and Cam (Eric Stonestreet) learn that their friends Raymond and J Marcus broke-up. This causes Mitchell to invite Raymond to a party they planned to organize with their friends. As neither of them can decide what is the best option, it's Gloria who helps to mediate. But things take another turn when Mitchell admits that if ever he and Cam break-up, Cam would be excluded. Gloria concludes that Mitchell could have feelings for Raymond, and he reluctantly admits that he is the Raymond in their couple.

This gene is a member of the caudal-related homeobox transcription factor family that also includes CDX1 and CDX2.  Function  The transcription factor encoded by the CDX4 gene participates in the formation of extra-embryonic tissues, anterior-posterior patterning and blood formation during embryogenesis. It does so through the regulation of Hox gene expression. Before placentation takes place, CDX4 plays a role in its development. CDX4 mutants are born healthy and are fertile, however its importance is revealed in compound CDX mutants. Compound mutants carrying one CDX2 null allele and homozygous null for CDX4 fail to generate posterior tissue caudal to the hindlimbs and most of these embryos die around embryonic day 10.5 from lack of placental development. Around 10% of this phenotype may progress to full term, but then die shortly after birth. Upon inspection the morphogenesis of ano-rectal and urethral tissues was observed. The most well described function of CDX genes are their role in caudal body formation. Transcription factors of the CDX gene family, in part control Hox gene expression by responding to signaling molecules Retinoic Acid, Wnt, and FGF. The redundant contribution of CDX4 in axial elongation is shown in that neither CDX4 null or CDX1/CDX4 compound mutants appear with impaired axial elongation. However, CDX4 does have a role in determining pancreatic B-cell number, specifying anterior-posterior location of the foregut organs including the pancreas and liver. Thus, an abnormal state is shown in embryos deficient in CDX4 by posteriorly shifted pancreas, liver and small intestines. In blood formation, CDX4 regulation of Hox genes is necessary for the specification of hematopoietic cell fate during embryogenesis. This is demonstrated by the fact that blood deficiencies in CDX4 mutants can be rescued by the over expression of certain Hox genes. Knockout models have been generated in mice as described in CDX4‚Äôs role in caudal body formation.

History = Founding = Yongmunsa Temple was established in 913 by the monk Daegyeong, who was originally from the Nampo region in southern Korea. He had been ordained at Muryangsa Temple, and learned meditation from the Seon master Muyeom. Daegyeong later traveled to Tang China to study under Yunju Daoying. Upon his return to Korea, he lived in seclusion on Mount Sobaek. One day, King Taejo, founder of the Goryeo Dynasty, visited Daegyeong and listened to his lectures on the dharma. Impressed, the king invited Daegyong to Borisa Temple in Yangpyeong, which was probably an earlier name for today's Yongmunsa. Another story relates that the temple was established by Crown Prince Maui, the last prince of Unified Silla. = Joseon Dynasty = No records from the Goryeo Dynasty exist about Yongmunsa Temple, but references to it began to appear in records from the Joseon Dynasty (1392‚Äì1897). A stupa and stele can be found on the slope of a mountain east of Yongmunsa, erected in memory of Jeongji, a National Preceptor, a high-ranking position among Buddhist clergy. Originally from Hwanghae Province, Jeongji went to Beijing with his dharma brother, Muhak (1327-1405). Together, they visited Fayuan Temple, and met with the Indian monk Dhyanabhadra. Later, Jeongji studied under the teacher Hyegun. Jeongji died in 1338. According to legend, many shining ≈õarƒ´ra relics were collected from his ashes after his cremation. King Taejo bestowed on him the posthumous title of Guksa (\\"National Preceptor\\"), and had Gwon Geun, an esteemed writer of the time, write an epitaph to be inscribed on his stele. In 1447, Prince Suyang reconstructed the main Buddha hall for his mother, Queen Consort Soheon, under the royal decree of King Sejong. The Prince continued to support the renovation of Yongmunsa Temple even after being crowned King Sejo. The temple underwent many reconstructions after this. = Korean Empire = Much of Yongmunsa Temple was burned down by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1907. The temple had been used as headquarters for Korean militias, which prompted its destruction when the Japanese forcibly disbanded the militias. Most of the buildings now at Yongmunsa Temple were reconstructed after 1909.  Cultural properties  Several elements of the temple have been designated by the South Korean government as national cultural properties. * Natural Monument No. 30: An enormous gingko tree on the temple grounds, believed to be the largest in Asia, and estimated to be 1100 to 1500 years old. It is 42 meters high and 14 meters in circumference at the base. It yields 100 straw bags of gingko nuts every year. * Treasure No. 1790: A gilt-bronze statue of Avalokitesvara, produced during the time Jeongji lived at Yongmusa Temple during the transition period from Goryeo to Joseon. It is considered a fine example of medieval Korean Buddhist sculpture. * Treasure No. 531: The stupa and memorial stele of Jeongji, showing the simple but graceful style of the early Joseon era.

Palazzo Doria was the only palace in Strada Nuova to be seriously damaged by the French naval bombing in 1684, which required a serious renovation, completed by architect Gio. Antonio Ricca with the adding of a story and the redesign of the fa√ßade . However, the 17th-century restoration did not alter the original sequence of atrium, courtyard and garden planned by Castello. The palace was purchased by Gio. Batta Spinola, then it passed to the Doria family in 1723. The Dorias did not see the need for a refurbishing of the palace, beyond routine repairs and the addition of a notable lantern in the atrium with the coat of arms of the Doria family.

It aired on January 6, 2016 on American Broadcasting Company (ABC). The episode is directed by Claire Scanlon and written by Jeffrey Richman. Plot Haley (Sarah Hyland), Alex (Ariel Winter), and Luke (Nolan Gould) are surprised when Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) shows up in order to cash a coupon they gave him for his belated birthday. It turns out they actually forgot his birthday this year, so they scramble in order to give him a good day. When they're out of ideas, they decide to show him an impromptu tour of celebrity homes. Here, Mitchell meets actor Ray Liotta. The kids apologize to him, since he is the first who calls them and he always gives them extraordinary gifts. Mitch reassures them by telling them that he knew that they didn't plan something. Ray decides to introduce him to Barbra Streisand, and, though Mitch only can hear her voice, it makes him happy. Phil (Ty Burrell) and Claire (Julie Bowen) have a lunch with another couple, Tom and Lisa Delaney, whom they met during a vacation in Cabo. Despite the couple's wealth, every time they eat together, Phil always picks up the tab while the couple ignores the check. Claire insists Phil does the same this time, but he still wants to pay the bill. After a long game of \\"who will break first?\\", Phil finally and reluctantly admits that he and Tom made a bet in Cabo as to which man could sneak more roasted crickets into his wife's food. Phil had lost by only feeding Claire three crickets to Tom feeding Lisa six, and he now has to pay for the next five of the couples' dates in a row. However, both Claire and Lisa are furious at their husbands for \\"poisoning\\" them and vow to do the same to them in the future. They leave, not knowing that Phil and Tom had secretly been in the middle of another cricket bet, which Phil has again lost, this time by only feeding Claire one cricket to Tom feeding Lisa two. Elsewhere, Jay (Ed O'Neill) and Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) also have a playdate with a couple whose son is the same age as Joe (Jeremy Maguire). It turns out the couple have similarities with them, especially the husband who describes Jay as old as him. This infuriates Jay who still wants to prove that he is not an old man, but Gloria reassures him saying that age also can affect women. Jay then introduces Marty to Netflix, but it's Marty who has the last word with streaming. At the same time, Manny (Rico Rodriguez) has a puberty problem with his mustache that only he can see. Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) has invited the family who live upstairs for lunch. He realizes that Lily (Aubrey Anderson-Emmons) could have a crush on the family's son. He gives her some advice in order to make her flirt with him. However, his plan backfires when he sees that Lily actually has feelings for the family's dad, which forces him to intervene and open his heart to his daughter about his first crush.

He has also been a Member of the Executive Council for Economic Development and Environmental Affairs in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa under the Premier of the Eastern Cape Phumulo Masualle, and was a Member of the National Assembly of South Africa from 2014 to 2017. He graduated from Vista University with a Bachelor of Arts in History and Sociology, and a Higher Diploma in Education from Rhodes University. Jonas alleges that in 2015 the Gupta family offered him 600 million South African rand to be the next finance minister, as long as he followed their agenda. In December 2019, Jonas was appointed as the Board Chairperson of South Africa's MTN Group, a South African multinational mobile telecommunications company. Early life Mcebisi Jonas was born in 1960 in Uitenhage in the Eastern Cape Province. He matriculated at Newewell High School in Port Elizabeth and achieved a Bachelor of Arts in History & Sociology at Vista University. He expanded his studies with a Higher Diploma in Education at Rhodes University. When Jonas was 14, he became active in politics. He led political activities in the Port Elizabeth area and started underground structures in the Eastern Cape and beyond. He was motivated by the politics of the Black Consciousness Movement in the early 1980s and was an organiser of AZASO (Azanian Students Organisation). He played an important role in the founding of the United Democratic Front (UDF) structures in the Eastern Cape. He was later sent into exile to finish military training in Angola and Uganda for the People‚Äôs Army, Umkhonto Wesizwe (MK). While in exile, he was hired by the United Nations to run an education program for the Mkhonto Wesizwe (MK) cadres. Upon his return in the '90s, Mr Jonas played a crucial role in creating the structures of the ANC and the SACP in the Eastern Cape. Identifying his outstanding skills, the ANC implemented him to form the new Provincial administration in the Eastern Cape in 1994.

Display typefaces will often have more eccentric and variable designs than the simple, relatively restrained typefaces generally used for body text. They may take inspiration from other genres of lettering, such as handpainted signs, calligraphy or an aesthetic appropriate to their use, perhaps ornamented, exotic, abstracted or drawn in the style of a different writing system. Several genres of font are particularly associated with display setting, such as slab serif, script font, reverse-contrast and to a lesser extent sans serif. Walter Tracy defines display typefaces in the metal type sense as \\"sizes of type over 14 point\\" and in design that \\"text types when enlarged can be used for headings, display types, if reduced, cannot be used for text setting.\\" Historical background For the first centuries of printing, display type generally did not exist. Printing was used primarily to print body text, although there might be use of some larger-sized letters for titling. Typefaces not intended for body text remained rooted in conventional letterforms: roman type, script typeface or blackletter. Signs were created as custom handlettering. The arrival of the poster and greater use of signage spurred the arrival of new kinds of letterform, both as lettering and in print. Historian James Mosley has written that ‚Äúbig types had been cast in sand, using wooden patterns, for some centuries [by 1750] but there is evidence that English typefounders only began to make big letters for posters and other commercial printing towards 1770, when Thomas Cottrell made his 'Proscription or Posting letter of great bulk and dimension' and William Caslon II cast his 'Patagonian' or 'Proscription letters‚Äô.‚Äù New technologies, notably riveted \\"sanspareil\\" matrices made printing at large sizes easier from the beginning of the nineteenth century. At the same time, new designs of letter began to appear around the beginning of the nineteenth century, such as \\"fat face\\" typefaces (based on serif faces of the period, but much bolder), slab serifs (first seen from Vincent Figgins around 1817), sans-serifs (already used in custom lettering but effectively unused in printing before the 1830s) and new blackletter faces. An important development that followed was wood type, which could be pantograph and allowed cheap printing of large type on posters. Many nineteenth-century display typefaces were extremely, aggressively bold and condensed in order to attract attention. Equally, some display typefaces such as Cochin and Koch-Antiqua have a particularly delicate build with a low x-height, and this style was very popular around the start of the twentieth century. With phototypesetting and digital printing methods allowing fonts to be printed at any size, it has become possible to use fonts in situations where before hand-lettering would be most common, such as on business logos and metal fabricated lettering. Many modern digital typeface families such as Neutraface, Neue Haas Grotesk, and Arno include both text styles and display companion optical sizes with a more delicate design. Walter Tracy comments that in adapting a text face to display use such as in a headline \\"a judicious closing-up of the letters\\" improves the appearance. Styles of display typeface Common genres of display typeface include: * Lettering with a design intended to seem hand-drawn, such as script fonts or designs with swashes * ‚ÄúShadowed‚Äù, ‚Äúengraved‚Äù, ‚Äúinline‚Äù or ‚Äúhandtooled‚Äù lettering, with a blank space in the centre intended to suggest three- dimensional letters in relief. An early genre of display type, inline sans- serifs were also very popular in lettering of the inter-war period.http://typographica.org/on-typography/farewell-futura-hello-neutraface- no-2/ \\"Shaded\\" or hatched designs have also been made which appear grey when viewed at a distance. * Unusual or abstract redesigns of the alphabet, such as those drawn by the Bauhaus school of design, Milton Glaser‚Äôs Baby Teeth or Ind√©pendant. * ‚ÄúDistressed‚Äù lettering, intended to seem damaged or distorted, such as Shatter or Electric Circus * Ultra-light or ultra-bold adaptations of conventional letterforms, such as \\"fat face\\" types, Cooper Black or Gill Kayo * Mixed case lettering that mixes upper- and lower-case letters in unexpected ways for an unconventional effect * Reverse-contrast typefaces that invert the contrast of conventional writing, with the horizontals made thicker than the verticals. * Lettering made to suggest an aesthetic, such as modernism, the natural world, or another genre of lettering. Examples of the latter include use of stencil or embossing tape fonts to suggest an industrial aesthetic. * ‚ÄúMimicry‚Äù or ‚Äúsimulation‚Äù typefaces intended to suggest another writing system. These are often used by restaurants. A more prosaic genre of \\"display typefaces\\" is those intended for signage, such as Johnston, Highway Gothic, Transport and Clearview. These often have adaptations to increase legibility and make letters more distinct from each other. For example, Johnston and Transport have a curl on the lower-case ‚ÄòL‚Äô to distinguish it from an upper- case ‚Äòi'. In German the term \\"Akzidenzschrift\\" (commercial or trade typeface) is used for faces not intended for body text but without implying a specific size range, so including small-size sans-serifs in uses such as on tickets. The famous sans-serif Akzidenz-Grotesk's name (literally commercial sans- serif) derives from this scheme). Note that these genres may also be seen in custom lettering, with which this topic overlaps. Older examples of lettering are often custom-drawn, rather than fonts.

A native-born Jerusalemite, he teaches at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and lives in the German Colony neighbourhood of that city. Scholarly career Amiel obtained his Ph.D in 1983 at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with a doctoral dissertation on Aulus Gellius entitled Aulus Gellius as Reader of Poetry (Hebrew). He was subsequently appointed lecturer in classics in 1995, and senior lecturer in 2002. His interests range from Literary reception in Latin to Latin Literary Theory. He has a particular research focus on the Noctes Atticae of the Latin writer Aulus Gellius, and, in the estimation of Leofranc Holford-Strevens, is one of the foremost contributors to the subject in recent times. Vardi is also interested in the history of concept formation, and contributes to summer courses on the topic at the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute. He has analysed the development of the notion of a literary canon, and the concept of ‚Äúthe arts‚Äù which ancient languages had no precise term for defining in the modern sense... Human Rights Vardi did regular service in the IDF but reportedly declined to answer a call-up to serve as a soldier in the West Bank during the First Intifada.. At the time he was a Sergeant major in the IDF military reserve and was sentenced to 29 days' imprisonment on 16 May 1991. Amnesty International protested the measure.. When the Al-Aqsa Intifada broke out, Vardi became a co-founding member of, and one of the driving forces behind a grassroots human rights organization, Ta'ayush, a mixed community of civil rights activists constituted by both Israeli and Palestinian volunteers... Ta'ayush, which is opposed to the segregational policies of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, works towards the establishment of equality between Jewish Israelis and Palestinians. He is active, as both a guide to foreign deputations trying to grasp the dynamics of the conflict. and as a protector and helping hand during Palestinian harvesting and pastoral activities. He has been present in many areas where conflict is endemic, from Yanun in the north to Susya to the far south, from Jayyus in the west near the Israeli West Bank barrier and the Green Line,. to areas in East Jerusalem affected by the policy of the Judaization of Jerusalem, such as the tiny hamlet of Nuaman and Sheikh Jarrah, and in particular in the South Hebron Hills. He also works on civil rights causes for Israeli Palestinians and was active in opposing the bulldozing of the Abu Eid family residences in the Abu Toq neighborhood in Lod... Vardi conceives of his work as the pursuit, not only of justice, but of truth and working in the South Hebron Hills to defend Bedouin from settler landgrabs 'exposes the lie and reveals truth in all its clarity.' Vardi has been arrested, according to his colleague and fellow activist David Dean Shulman, perhaps hundreds of times. He has throughout, Shulman adds, proved selfless, persistent and cool, displaying a legal expertise that has reportedly earned him the respect of the Israeli officers who interrogate him..< He has received written apologies for unlawful arrest. Part of Ta'ayush's work is to clean pastoral terrain of poisonous pellets seeded by settlers into them to damage Palestinian flocks grazing on them and in this area Vardi has reportedly also acquired an extensive knowledge of toxins. He has a high regard for Ezra Nawi, who, Vardi says, unlike most Ta'ayush activists has no comfortable employment. Though they often disagree, Nawi's mastery of Arabic, and his intuitive grasp of the underlying problems, is crucial for all of the other human rights groups, such as Ta'ayush, Yesh Din, Rabbis for Human Rights and Physicians for Human Rights, who all work in the Hebron area.: Einer der Hauptgr√ºnde, warum Ezra eine so wichtige Person ist, ist seine Pers√∂nlichkeit. Ich meine, er ist eine leichte Beute f√ºr seine Kritiker, da er irakischen Ursprungs ist und von Beruf ( nur) ein Installateur. Die meisten von uns Aktivisten kommen aus gut situierten Jobs... Oft streiten wir uns √ºber Dinge, wie sie getan werden sollten. Manchmal haben wir recht und er unrecht, aber sehr oft ist seine Intuition viel besser als unsere, weil er einfach die Pal√§stinenser viel besser versteht. Ich kann mir keine Aktion in der ganzen Region s√ºdlich von Jerusalem ohne Ezra denken. Das trifft nicht nur f√ºr Taayush zu, sondern f√ºr alle Organisationen, die √Ñrzte f√ºr Menschenrechte, die Rabbiner f√ºr Menschenrechte, Yesh Din ‚Ä¶ alle h√§ngen von Ezra ab. Deshalb ist f√ºr uns Ezra im Moment ‚Äì wo er verhaftet wurde -- so wichtig.' In the South Hebron hills, Vardi, together with other Ta'ayush volunteers, often accompanies the Palestinian shepherds as they take their flocks to slowly graze over the pastures. The presence of these Bedouin herders is strongly challenged by settlers, and a protective presence and monitoring by outside observers is deemed necessary at least once a week, usually on Friday and Saturday.. Aside from dealing with the Border Police and IDF when objections are raised to the Bedouins' use of their land, the time is often passed discussing Latin, pastoral poetry and the works of Virgil with his friend David Shulman: Virgil's work proves to be, Shulman adds, 'a benign and lyrical presence in this tortured Mediterranean domain.'. Amiel Vardi, together with Guy Butavia and Ezra Nawi, was detained for questioning after filming illegal construction at the settlement of Avigayil on 30 March 2013, work done despite a stop-work order issued by the Israeli military administration of the West Bank. Police were apparently persuaded by Avigayil's security coordinator to treat the matter differently. They were interrogated for several hours, and a formal complaint was laid against them. Butavia and Nawi filed suit against what they saw as an abuse, and won a verdict in their favour, with damages and a formal apology in 2015.. Graffiti with death threats have been sprayed on the Vardi family home.. He is co-signatory of an open letter to Elie Wiesel protesting the latter's public declarations about the situation in Jerusalem.. 2002 shooting incident On 19 October 2002, Vardi was shot by settlers while helping farmers collect their olive harvest in 2002. The settler responsible got off scot-free when he was charged before a court for the incident.... The incident took place outside Yanun where some weeks earlier, on 6 October, Hani Yusaf (24) of the sister village of Aqraba had been shot dead by a settler in similar circumstances. Though one settler was arrested, he was released soon after, and no indictment was laid. On the 19th. of the same month, 250 volunteers from Gush Shalom, Peace Now, Ta'ayush and the Women's Peace Coalition had come to help the locals gather in the annual harvest from their olive groves. Vardi worked with 5 villagers picking near the settlement of Yitzhar. When the settlers arrived and shouted at them only to be met with silence, they began shooting. The Palestinians ran off, but Vardi refused to budge. Unlike the times he had been shot at while serving in the IDF, he wasn't scared, he recalls, but rather furious. Identifying himself as a fellow Israeli he yelled: \\"I'm a Jew and I came here to help pick these olives, and I am going to pick them,\\" only to be told he was a \\"dirty leftist\\". A shot rang out and he was wounded in the stomach, apparently by shrapnel from a cartridge that hit the ground nearby and ricocheted off. Vardi continued his harvesting, and he consulted a doctor only after the pain persisted on his reentry to his home in Jerusalem. The doctor found it difficult to believe Vardi's account that he had been shot at by a fellow Jew. The shrapnel was removed by surgery the following day. He partially holds himself at fault for challenging the settlers with a defiant declaration... He nonetheless regards the incident as strengthening his commitment to civil rights. 'After I was shot while . . . I knew there was no turning back.'. Safa incident In June 2009, according to the account given by Vardi and hosted on Bernard Avishai's blog, when 30 Ta'ayush activists went to accompany Palestinians at Safa to their fields, on arrival they were met by 2 units of Israeli Border Police who set about systematically punching, rifle-butting and then arresting the Israeli contingent. They were handcuffed and had their heads smashed against jeeps, and the episode was caught on a Walla! video. The incident was unusual - it was in his experience the first time Israeli activists had been subjected to brutal assault- and Vardi likened the police behavior to what occurs in Iran when the authorities intervene against demonstrating groups. Simultaneously with the beatings, residents from the settlement of Bat Ayin set the villagers' olive groves alight a few hundred yards off, and were left undisturbed by the police.. Sahar Vardi His daughter, Sahar Vardi (b.1991) is also active in Human Rights causes in Israel and the Palestinian territories, having begun at the early age of 14, against her father's objections, to join protests at the weekly demonstration marches of the villagers of Bil'in. She was one of the shministim or high school refuseniks, and, on reaching her maturity, declared herself a conscientious objector to military service. She was sentenced to serve time in an Israeli military prison for several months... Her work has been recognized by the Nobel Women's Initiative. She has been struck in the face by an Israeli soldier, who hit her cheek with his rifle butt during a demonstration. Selected publications * Why Attic Nights? Or What's in a Name?

History  Wang Geon's Prayers for the Unification of the Later Three Kingdoms Samhwasa Temple (Korean: ÏÇºÌôîÏÇ¨, Chinese: ‰∏âÂíåÂØ∫, Pronounced ‚ÄúSam-hwa-sa‚Äù) was established by Ven. Jajang Yulsa in 642. Initially named Heungnyeondae it was renamed Samgongam Hermitage in 864 when National Preceptor Ven. Beomil Guksa reconstructed it, and the temple's role also changed from being a Doctrinal School to a Seon School. It was in Samgongam Hermitage that Wang Geon, the future King Taejo of Goryeo, prayed for the unification of the later three kingdoms. When he actually achieved unification, he renamed the temple Samhwasa (lit. ‚ÄúHarmony of the Three‚Äù Temple) in the sense that Goryeo, Later Baekje and Silla would end their ongoing conflict and coexist in harmony. When Yi Seong-gye founded Joseon after destroying Goryeo's regal power, he had King Gongyang and the last of his followers drowned in the ocean in front of Samcheok. To console their ghosts, Samhwasa Temple was tasked with offering the Water and Land Ceremony (Suryukjae) after the founding of Joseon. Later in 1747, Samhwasa Temple was damaged by floods and landslides. After relocation to a higher site, it was destroyed by fire in 1820, but was reconstructed again in 1824. In 1907, the temple was torched by the Japanese army under the pretext that some militia men were staying there. Many buildings, including the Main Buddha Hall and Seon Hall, about 200 bays in size, were destroyed. There are many historical relics and legends related to Samhwasa Temple. The Jewang ungi (Â∏ùÁéãÈüªÁ¥Ä; Songs of Emperors and Kings) was written by Yi Seung-hyu who promoted a spirit of nationalism in the later Goryeo era. After concentrating on reading sutras for 10 years in his house, he then donated it to Samhwasa Temple; it was later transformed into Ganjangam Hermitage  Cultural properties  Iron Rocana Buddha and Idu Script Samhwasa Temple's cultural heritage includes: a Three-Story Stone Pagoda (Treasure No. 1277); an Iron Seated Rocana Buddha (Treasure No.1292) ; the stupa of Ven. Sangjun Daesa; and the stupa and stele of Ven. Wongokdang Daeseonsa. The Three-Story Stone Pagoda, which stands 4.95 meters (16 feet) high, and belongs to the Goryeo era, radiates stability with its well-balanced proportions. The Rocana Buddha is an iron Buddha produced during the Unified Silla era. It was originally thought to be a Medicine Buddha, but later, an inscribed text was found on its back, revealing it was actually a Rocana Buddha (ÁõßËàçÈÇ£‰Ωõ) created in the mid-9th century. The text was inscribed in Idu script, an archaic writing system representing the Korean language using Chinese characters. As it shows an actual example of Idu script, which was used around the 10th century, the statue has significant meaning in terms of Korean linguistics as well; it was designated Treasure No. 1292 in 1998.

A fishing harbour, built with Indo- Norwegian Project assistance, can be seen at this bay. *Azhikode Chal Beach: 8 km from Kannur, is a beach in Kerala. *Kizhunna Ezhara Beach: 11 km from Kannur, is one of the most secluded beaches in Kerala. *Dharmadam Island: (100 metres away from the mainland at Dharmadam): The small 5 acre (20,000 m2) island covered with coconut palms and dense bushes is visible from the Muzhappilangad beach. During low tide, one can walk to the island from the beach. It is surrounded by rivers and seas. Permission is required to enter this privately owned island. Dharmadam, earlier known as Dharmapattanam, was a Buddhist stronghold. Snake Park Snake Park is a landmark in the district of Snake Park at Parassinikkadavu, en route from Kannur to Taliparamba, from National Highway (NH) 17. Here there are a large genre of snakes and other small animals as well as a live show, where trained personnel play and 'interact' with a variety of snakes, including cobras and vipers, and seek to quell mythical fears and superstitions about snakes. The Snake Park was set up by the Visha Chikista Kendra at Pappinisseri and has become a centre of attraction to both foreign and domestic tourists. This Kendra (center) offers effective treatment for snake bites with almost 100% cure. This is the only place, perhaps where Ayurveda and Allopathy are effectively combined for curing snake bites. The snake park houses about 150 varieties of snakes including the Spectacled Cobra, King Cobra, Russell's viper, Krait and various pit vipers. There is also a large collection of non-poisonous snakes including Pythons. A research laboratory to extract venom from snakes is proposed for the location. The park is dedicated to the preservation and conservation of snakes, many species of which are facing gradual extinction. The laboratory is located from Kannur. Parassinikkadavu is noted for the Muthappan temple. This is the only temple in Kerala where a Theyyam performance is a daily ritual offering. Forts=St. Angelo Fort= St. Angelo Fort St. Angelo Fort, built in 1505 by Sir Francisco de Almeida, the first Portuguese Viceroy of India, is situated near the coast and about from Kannur town. This fort witnessed several wars for its control until the British flag finally flew over it in 1790. Even now, it is in a fairly good state of preservation, and is a protected monument under Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). A painting of this fort and the fishing ferry behind the fort can be seen in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. St Angelo Fort is an important historical monument and tourist centre. Kerala Police has posted six Tourism Police Officers for the protection and guidance of tourists. Among them, Sathyan Eddakkad has detailed knowledge about this fort and the surrounding places. He wrote and published a book in Malayalam named Vasco Da Gaamyum charithrathile kaanaappurangalum (Vasco Da Gama and the unknown pages of history) in which he describes the past and present of the Fort. The fort, though not as large as the well known Bekal Fort in Kasaragod, boasts lush greenery and well maintained surroundings. The Payyambalam and Government guest house are some of the other landmarks near the fort. =Tellicherry Fort= Tellicherry Fort is in Thalassery (Tellicherry) a town. Tellicherry was one of the most important European trading centers of Kerala. In the 17th century the British opened a factory north of Tellicherry. Later they obtained a site from Vadakkelamkur, the de facto ruler of Kolathunad and established a factory at Tellicherry in 1708. Paithalmala Paithalmala is a hill station on the Kerala-Karnataka border and is 65 km north of Kannur. Ideal for trekking; it is around 1,371.6 metres above sea level. A base reception centre and a watchtower atop the cliff function for the benefit of tourists and trekkers. It is near to Kudianmala. Ezhimala Ezhimala, the capital of the ancient Mooshika kings, is considered to be an ancient historical site. It is a conspicuous, isolated cluster of hills, forming a promontory, 38 km north of Kannur town. A flourishing sea port and centre of trade in ancient Kerala, it was one of the major battle fields of the Chola-Chera war of the 11th century. It is believed that Lord Buddha had visited Ezhimala. An old mosque, believed to contain the mortal remains of Shaikh Abdul Latif, a Muslim reformist, is also located here. The hill is noted for rare medicinal herbs. There is an old tower of great antiquity here, the Mount Deli Light House. It is maintained by the Indian Navy and is a restricted area. The beach sand is of a different texture and the sea is bluer than in other areas. At Ettikulam bay, one can enjoy watching dolphins. Bordered by sea on three sides, Ezhimala is set to occupy a prominent place in the Naval history of the country, subsequent to the proposal for commissioning the Indian Naval Academy there. Madayipara Madayi Para in August Madayipara is significant owing to its biodiversity as well as history. Madayipara was the administrative center of the Ezhimala kings. In and around Madayipara, one can find remnants from the past. At the southern side of the hill, stand the remains of a fort called Pazhi Kotta (kotta means fort in Malayalam). Here one can also find watchtowers at the four corners of the fort. Between AD 14 and AD 18, Madayipara used to be the site for the coronation ceremony of the rulers of the princely state of Kolathunadu. The hillock of Madayipara, which carries several signs of historic relevance, is also a place important from a religious point of view. Here, a pond in the shape of a hand held mirror, connected to ancient Jewish settlers, is another historic attraction. Similarly, a temple at this site, called Vadukunda Siva Temple, and the adjoining lake, about an acre in extent, form another attraction. The lake near the temple will not go dry even in hot summer months and remains a source of nourishment to life forms. The pooram festival of Madayi Kavu (kavu ‚Äì family temples and those in the midst of thick vegetation) held at Madayipara has been responsible for much of its fame. With regard to the biodiversity of Madayipara, the region contains about 300 flowering plants, about 30 varieties of grass, and several insect-eating plant species. Madayipara is also home to several rare medicinal herbs. Coming to avian life, Madayipara sustains about 100 species of butterflies and about 150 species of birds. Among the biggest butterflies in the world, the Atlas butterfly is a visitor to Madayipara.

They are some of the best preserved Roman cisterns. The cisterns, with a capacity of , received water from a branch of the Zaghouan Aqueduct (exactly which branch remains uncertain). They were designed to provide the water supply for Carthage, the most important city of Africa Proconsulare during the High Empire, and especially to supply the Baths of Antoninus. As part of the site of Carthage, the cisterns are classified as a World Heritage site by UNESCO. On 17 February 2012, the Tunisian government proposed that the whole Zaghouan-Carthage Roman hydraulic complex, of which they are a part, should be classed as a world heritage site. Dossier du complexe hydraulique romain de Zaghouan-Carthage (Unesco)  History  Map of aqueduct ruins (1838) Old photograph of a repurposed cistern The large, relatively well-preserved cisterns are located on the north side of the ancient Roman city. They were not the only largest cisterns of Carthage, but existed alongside others: the \\"basins of Hamilcar\\" and those located on the hill of Bordj Djedid. From the Middle Ages, the cisterns were used as makeshift houses, stables, barns or cellars by the local populations; a practice which continued until the twentieth century. For a long time this prevented archaeological investigation of the complex.Abdelmajid Ennabli et H√©di Slim, Carthage. Le site arch√©ologique, √©d. C√©r√®s, Tunis, 1993, p. 32 According to Al Idrisi, there were at least 24 cisterns in a single line, each with a length of 130 pace and a width of 26 pace - though Henri Saladin considered this width too high. According to Christian Tuxen Falbe, there were fifteen cisterns which were in width and four ruined cisterns a little to the west and each of these nineteen cisterns had a length of . There is an active project to conserve and restore the site, and to develop a museum space devoted to it.  Description  The group of cisterns forms a rectangular space measuring x (). Each cistern is composed of a vaulted space, long, wide and high (excluding the vault), with a total capacity of . There are fifteen individual cisterns, which are separated from one another and arranged in parallel. Each vault has about ten circular openings. A cistern which distributed water to the others is aligned perpendicular to the others. A subsidiary aqueduct derived from the Zaghouan Aqueduct ran alongside the distribution cistern and supplied it with water through openings on its edge. The presence of numerous circular openings on top of the each cistern's vault appear to be openings for water to escape through when the cisterns were too full or for collecting rain water. However, it is probable that the cisterns were actually surmounted by another level of tanks - in the same manner as Gallo-Roman two-story reservoirs. R√©servoir et distribution de l'eau en ville (Rue des Lumi√®res) The large cisterns were relied upon by the vast bath complex of Antoninus. The water flowed down from the cisterns to the baths through underground pipes.Azedine Beschaouch, La l√©gende de Carthage, coll. D√©couvertes Gallimard (n¬∞ 172), √©d. Gallimard, Paris, 1993, p. 102 In the immediate neighbourhood of the cisterns are other important sites: the , the villa of Scorpianus and some mausoleums, one of which has been re-constructed in a special room of the Bardo National Museum.

Although not typical of Williams' work it brought her to prominence and is the composer's most popular work. The orchestration includes the harp to add a Welsh flavour and percussion to evoke memories of childhood. Composition history It is not clear when Williams started to compose the Fantasia but Benjamin Britten records a meeting with Williams to discuss \\"her new Welsh variations\\" on 24 March 1938. Williams claimed that \\"I tossed it off (i.e. the sketch of it) in an evening\\" ‚Äì in a letter to Idris Lewis (musical director of British International Pictures) in June 1942. The last page of the score is annotated \\"Feb 9th 1940\\". The Fantasia may have been modelled on Sir Henry Wood's Fantasia on British Sea Songs, or the fantasias on folk tunes by Vaughan Williams, Williams' teacher, where a number of familiar tunes are joined with original music. Structure and instrumentation The work lasts about 11 minutes and is in one movement using eight Welsh tunes. The beginning and end use the quicker tunes which frame a middle section which uses the slower, wistful tunes. Each tune is stated and discussed, and followed by a transition into the next tune. The work finishes with a return to the initial theme. The tunes, in order, are: *Jim Cro ‚Äì also known as Dacw Mam yn Dw√¢d (Here's mummy coming) *Deryn y Bwn (The Bittern) *Migildi, Magildi (nonsense words imitating the sound of a hammer on an anvil) *Si lwli mabi (Sleep my baby) *Gee Geffyl Bach (Gee-up, little horse) *Cysga Di, Fy Mhlentyn Tlws (Sleep, my pretty child) *Yr eneth ffein ddu (Where are you going, my pretty maid?) *Cadi Ha (Summer Katie) The Fantasia starts at a lively pace (allegro vivo) with the tune (Jim Cro) played on the trumpet. The trumpet, now muted, introduces Deryn y Bwn (the rhythm of the original tune is adapted to match that of Jim Cro). Migildi, Magildi starts on the glockenspiel (one bar), then the strings (one bar), the glockenspiel again (one bar), and strings again (one bar), before the oboe completes the tune. The slower middle section, marked molto tranquillo (very calmly), begins with Si lwli mabi on flute; followed by Gee Geffyl Bach on french horn; and ends with Cysga Di, Fy Mhlentyn Tlws (on oboe and bassoon). The last section returns to the lively pace of the opening with a reprise of Jim Cro before Yr eneth ffein ddu is introduced on oboe and violins. The last new tune (Cadi Ha) is also introduced on trumpet, before the Fantasia finishes with a return to Jim Cro. The Fantasia is written for a full orchestra: *Woodwind: 2 flutes (II + piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, and 2 bassoons *Brass: 2 trumpets, 4 french horns, and 3 trombones (2 tenor and 1 bass) *Percussion: timpani, 2 players (side drum, cymbals, tambourine, triangle, and glockenspiel) *Strings: harp, violins, violas, cellos, and double bass Performance The Fantasia was given its first performance by the BBC Northern Orchestra conducted by Eric Fogg on 29 October 1941 in a broadcast by the BBC. Performances throughout Wales followed (with premieres by the National Youth Orchestra of Wales and Welsh National Opera in 1946) and the good reception led to the first recording a few years later. Another performance of Fantasia by the National Youth Orchestra of Wales (NYOW) in 1952 was followed by performances of works by Williams in 1953, 1954, and 1955 (Penillion ‚Äì which was commissioned and premiered by NYOY). Tension between Williams and the orchestra's management resulted in Williams refusing permission to allow the NYOW to perform her works. A change in management was followed by a performance of Fantasia by the orchestra in 1968. A commercially successful recording of Fantasia (with works by other Welsh composers) by the NYOW followed in 1969 and sold 20,000 copies in less than a year. Reception and reviews The immediate popularity of the Fantasia, especially in war-time Wales, helped Williams to become more widely known, and it is still her most popular work and an important part of her output. The Fantasia has been described as \\"deliciously scored, whimsical, touching and light-hearted by turns\\". Guy and Llewelyn-Jones note that the use of percussion emphasises the \\"colours and imagery of childhood\\" and the harp \\"adds some strong Celtic flavour\\". Cotterill notes that \\"The Fantasia's greatest achievement, however, in spite of its necessarily fragmented nature and thematic diversity, is that it retains a sophisticated level of cohesion that Hen Walia [an earlier work] fails to approach by more confidently deploying its traditional material.\\" Mathias describes it as \\"a work of bold and colourful tonal contrasts\\". By contrast, Boyd notes that \\"the harmonizations are often heavy and conventional, and the structure loose\\". He also compares the orchestration unfavourably with that of Hoddinott's Welsh Dances (Set 1 ‚Äì 1956; Set 2 ‚Äì 1969) and Mathias's Celtic Dances (1972). The Fantasia remains popular with performers both young and old. Williams' attitudes to the Fantasia Williams clearly felt affection for Fantasia: and: but feared that its success may limit the BBC's enthusiasm for new works (as had happened with Hen Walia earlier in her career). In 1957 Williams successfully lobbied for Penillion (1955) rather than the Fantasia (\\"that old work\\") to be scheduled for the 1958 Proms season. In 1968 the National Youth Orchestra of Wales ran a competition to attract young composers but failed to find any suitable compositions, so planned to return to the Fantasia. Williams suggested various composers but none had entered the competition so, to Williams' dismay, the Fantasia was scheduled again including a performance at the Eisteddfod that year. This led to another recording (along with other works by Welsh composers). Recordings The Fantasia was first recorded in 1949 by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Mansel Thomas, paid for by the Welsh Recorded Music Society (later to become the Welsh Music Guild), and released on a 78 rpm record. It was the first recording of a work by a female Welsh composer. The recording was later included in the Decca catalogue. Recordings include: *London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Mansel Thomas (78 rpm, 1949 and on LP, 1950, Decca AK1999-2000 and LX3025) *National Youth Orchestra of Wales conducted by Arthur Davison (LP, 1969, Music for Pleasure SMFP2129) *London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Charles Groves (Grace Williams (also includes Carillons, Penillion, Trumpet Concerto, and Sea Sketches), LP, 1974, HMV ASD3006 and CD, 1995, Lyrita SRCD323)) *Royal Ballet Sinfonia conducted by Andrew Penny (CD, 1999, Naxos 8.225048) NotesReferences=Sources=    External links * Includes a viewable score of the Fantasia *Conductor's score and parts on hire ‚Äì Oxford University Press *Short extract of the Fantasia ‚Äì BBC Music Category:Compositions for symphony orchestra Category:Compositions by Grace Williams Category:1940 compositions Category:Fantasias (music) ","title":"Fantasia on Welsh Nursery Tunes"},{"id":"49130139","text":"Banyasa is a Buddhist temple of the Jogye Order in Chungcheong, South Korea.  History  Banyasa Temple (Korean: Î∞òÏïºÏÇ¨, Chinese: Ëà¨Ëã•ÂØ∫, Pronounced ‚ÄúBa-nya- sa‚Äù) is said to have been established in 720 by Ven. Wonhyo or by Ven. Sangwon, one of Uisang's ten major disciples, but there are no records to confirm this. Another story tells that National Preceptor Ven. Muyeom was its founder; this story has a more concrete background as it says: ‚ÄúWhen Ven. Muyeom resided at Simmyosa Temple in Hwanggan, he dispatched a novice monk named Ven. Sunin to the temple site to cast out the evil dragon living in the pond. Ven. Sunin then established Banyasa Temple after filling in the pond.‚Äù The name ‚ÄúBanyasa‚Äù originated from a plaque King Sejo wrote when he attended the inauguration ceremony for the temple's reconstruction. Banyasa Temple was scheduled to open when King Sejo came to see Ven. Sinmi Daesa at Bokcheonam Hermitage on Mt. Songnisan. King Sejo healed his own skin problems at Banyasa Temple, as he did at Sangwonsa Temple on Mt. Odaesan, thanks to the blessing of the child Manjusri. Afterward, he named the temple Banya (Ëà¨Ëã•; perfection of wisdom), and even wrote its plaque, which is still preserved.  Landscape  Banyasa Temple's only designated heritage, the Three-Story Stone Pagoda (Treasure No. 1371), was relocated in 1950 from the so-called ‚ÄúTapbeol,‚Äù situated in the Seokcheon Valley north of Banyasa Temple. Thus, the pagoda doesn't provide any reliable information about the temple's history. In addition, the Buddha triad enshrined in the Main Buddha Hall, and the two monk's stupas are designated Regional Cultural Heritage of Yeongdong-gun No. 9, No. 10, No. 11 and No. 12, in that order.  Cultural properties  Taegeuk-Shaped Terrain and a Tiger In front of Banyasa Temple, Gusucheon Stream, fed by water from Mt. Baekhwasan, forms an S-shape, which some people see as a ‚Äútaegeuk.‚Äù (symbol of great polarity or yin-yang). In the center of the stream rises a lotus bud-shaped piece of land, on which Banyasa Temple seems to lean. The temple's Munsujeon Hall perches atop a 100-meter-high cliff that overlooks the stream. The Hall reminds visitors they are in the sanctuary of Manjusri Bodhisattva. Standing with one's back to the Main Buddha Hall, to the rear of the dormitory on one's right, lies a 300-meter long, natural scree-rockslide that forms the perfect outline of a crouching tiger about to leap. To attract more tourists Yeongdong-gun County recently established a photo zone from where visitors can take good pictures with the tiger's outline clearly seen in the background. The tiger's image is, geomantically, in the right place in these remote mountains, part of the Baekdu-daegan, the 460-mile-long mountain range that runs north and south the length of the Korean Peninsula.

He never takes a personal approach, instead choosing to film his subjects from a distance with his video camera. Aloys loathes personal contact with others, ignoring various residents of his apartment, and especially the woman next door, who has tried to ask him for assistance several times. On the bus ride home from the funeral, a depressed Aloys drinks himself to unconsciousness. When he wakes up the next morning in the bus, he finds his camera and the tapes of his subjects are all missing. A short time later a female voice calls him on the telephone, telling him that she stole his tapes, watched them, and plans to send them to the filmed subjects. Aloys threatens to call the police, but it proves an empty threat, instead using his skills to attempt to identify the caller via the clues. But the caller is always one step ahead of him, mocking his attempts. During one call, the female voice, in return for the tapes, asks Aloys to perform a \\"telephone hike\\", where both callers concentrate on visualizing a shared location and imagine conversing in their imagined locale. After hesitating, Aloys complies, going on an imagined walk through the woods together with the woman. When he tries to initiate further telephone hikes, the woman abruptly and angrily ends the conversation. Returning home one night, he finds his unconscious neighbor being loaded into an ambulance. Using some of the clues that he obtained while trying to unmask the caller, he realizes that his neighbor, Vera, the same one he ignored earlier, is the mysterious woman. He learns Vera is a zookeeper who kept exotic animals, lost her job after kidnapping a sheep, and attempted suicide. Not knowing whether she survived, he volunteers to water her flowers and feed her pet iguana. Days later, a hospitalized Vera texts Aloys thanking him for looking after her stuff. Aloys, elated, now tries to initiate the hikes. Vera hesitatingly gives in and both have repeated telephone hikes, with Aloys inviting her to a tour of his apartment to host a virtual party with all the people Aloys has watched or encountered in his investigations, and eventually, physically traveling to his favorite restaurant to have an imagined dinner with Vera, and visiting the zoo Vera worked at, with Vera giving him a tour through the phone. One day, however, the real Vera, on leave from the hospital, attempts to visit Aloys at his apartment. He does not let her in, entranced by his imagined version of her, and afraid of human contact once more. A dejected Vera leaves and returns to the hospital. The shock of seeing the real Vera leave prompts Aloys into overcoming his fears, and he follows Vera to the hospital, sneaking into her room in the night and sleeping on the ground next to her bed.

History  Established by Ven. Doseon Guksa and Reconstructed by Ven. Sumi Daesa Dogapsa Temple (Korean: ÎèÑÍ∞ëÏÇ¨, Chinese: ÈÅìÂ≤¨ÂØ∫, Pronounced ‚ÄúDo-gap- sa‚Äù) was established by National Preceptor Ven. Doseon Guksa, one of four eminent monks of Silla, in the 6th year of the reign of Silla's King Heongang. No records about it from the Goryeo era exist, but in 1456 in early Joseon, the eminent monk Ven. Sumi Daesa rebuilt it into a large temple. Appointed National Preceptor by King Sejong, he reconstructed the temple with royal support so that it covered an area of 966 bays. In 1653, the stele of Ven. Doseon Sumi and the stele for the reconstruction of Dogapsa Temple's stone bridge were made. The inscriptions on both were written by Yi Gyeong-seok, Yi Su-in and Jeong Du-gyeong, who at that time were serving as Chief State Councilors and Ministers of Justice. Later in 1677, flagpole supports were erected, and in 1682, a large stone basin was built to store water. In the mid-18th century, Ven. Yeondam Yuil, a great and accomplished scholar of Avatamsaka studies, lived here and published a Buddhist dictionary titled Seokjeon yuhae (ÈáãÂÖ∏È°ûËß£). Little is known of Dogapsa Temple's history after the 19th century. A number of its cultural objects were damaged or lost during the Japanese invasion (1597-1598) and the Manchu invasion (1636-1637). What few items of cultural heritage remained were destroyed during the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910-1945) and the Korean War (1950-1953). When Ven. Sumi Daesa reconstructed the temple, there were 12 associated hermitages, including Sangdongam, Sangyeonam and Bijeonam, but at present there are only two, Sanggyeon-seongam and Dongam. In 1977, a fire broke out due to the carelessness of a visitor. Regrettably, it destroyed the Main Buddha Hall, called Daeung-bojeon, and many sacred cultural objects. Daeung-bojeon was restored in 1981. Another restoration project is now being carried out following a massive excavation survey done in 2009. Dubbed ‚ÄúMt. Geumgangsan of the Honam region‚Äù (southwest Korea), Mt. Wolchulsan is a place of great energy with numerous peaks. This energy is concentrated at Dogapsa Temple, which is gradually being restored.  Cultural properties  Dogapsa Temple has many cultural items, including: the Liberation Gate (National Treasure No. 50) ; Rock-Carved Seated Maitreya Bas-Relief (National Treasure No. 144) ; Seated Stone Buddha (Treasure No. 89); Child Manjusri on Lion and Child Samantabhadra on Elephant (Treasures No. 1134); Five-Story Stone Pagoda (Treasure No. 1433); a large stone basin; and the stele of Ven.

Life  Born in Avellino he attended the Italian Military Academy of Torino. At the outbreak of the Italo-Turkish War, he left for Libia in 1911 and in 1912 he was promoted to Major general. In that function, he commanded the Mixed Brigade during the Battle of Zanzur. His brigade played an important role during this battle and he was rewarded with the Military Order of Savoy. In World War I, as Lieutenant general, he commanded first the 10th Division and later the 4th Division.

Life and career Born in the town of Benevento, in southern Italy, he was mainly self-taught when he began to play the trumpet at the age of nineteen. For two years he abandoned the practice of the instrument to pursue a master's degree in economics. His love for the sound of Miles Davis and Chet Baker brought him back to the study of trumpet. In 2007 Universal Music released Sopra Le Nuvole, his first album as leader. A year later he recorded Lunaria with guests Roy Hargrove and Maria Pia De Vito. The album won the Top Jazz award by the Italian magazine Musica Jazz. In 2009, he recorded Amam, then TSC in a church in the Netherlands. In 2010, he recorded Icaro Solo for solo trumpet and electronics in a church in Benevento. After creating the festival Riverberi, a collaboration with Mimmo Paladino led to Chiaro an album in trio with a Norwegian rhythm section and special guest Lucio Dalla. In 2012, after a live album with American trumpeter Jon Hassell for the Church of Saint Augustine in Benevento, he joined the quartet of the percussionist Manu Katch√© and recorded two albums. In 2013 with the accordionist Carmine Ioanna he recorded aQustico for Tuk Music and embarked on a world tour. In 2015 OverDOORS was a tribute to his favorite rock band, The Doors. In December 2015 he worked with the Jordanian National Association Orchestra on an album in the archaeological site of Petra.http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/unesco- jorchestra-discover-petra's-melody' The album was made possible by the support of UNESCO Amman Office, the Petra Development and Tourism Authority, and the Talal Abu-Ghazaleh Organization (TAG-Org).

In 2017 a signature trumpet model \\"Aquino\\" was handcrafted by the Dutch artisan Hub Van Laar. In 2017 Aquino developed Bell's palsy, an injury to the seventh nerve in his face, forcing him to cancel the Jazz Bike Tour which included fifty concerts to be traveled by bike from Benevento to Oslo. Style He was influenced by the early playing of Chet Baker and Miles Davis, for which he was given the nickname \\"Apostle of Miles\\", and by the rock bands The Doors and AC/DC. He is known for research on natural sound, the use of electronics, and his passion for musical experimentation in unusual places.

It is also famous for archaeological discoveries. Except for the entrance, the cave is not accessible to the public, although occasionally it is opened for visitors. The cave is located in the northern part of the Moravian Karst, between the town of Sloup and the village of Ostrov. Amat√©rsk√° Cave is the longest cave system in the Czech Republic with a length of over 40 km-. The cave system is bound on two main underground streames: Bila voda and Sloupsky potok, (in underground) creating the River Punkva inside Amat√©rsk√° Cave. The whole system is created by the connection of (semi) separate caves: Nov√° Rasovna, Pikova Dama, Spiralka, 13C, Amaterska Cave, the Sloupsko-sosuvske Caves, the Punkevni Caves and Macocha Abbys.  Description of underground system  Scheme (map) of Amat√©rsk√° Cave system Amat√©rsk√° Cave is the connection between the water sinks of Sloupsk√Ω Potok and Bila Voda and the water resurgence of the Punkva River, which is created inside Amat√©rsk√° Cave by a connection of both main water streams. The cave itself is characterised by extensive tunnel passages with varying amounts of fluvial deposits and screes. The passages sometimes change into big domes. Those passages represent a higher cave level of about 20 m above the lower cave level where the rivers are still active. In some parts of the cave (Sloupsky Corridor, Labyrint of Milan Slechta), even more such cave levels can be found. The lowest part of the system is always under water and its exploration can only be done by using cave diving techniques. Amaterska Cave can be divided into 3 main parts: Sloupsky Corridor, Bila voda branch together with Old Amaterska cave and Macossky Corridor. Amat√©rsk√° Cave can be entered by one natural entrance in Cikansky Sink Hole or through an artificial one under Konsky Spad in Pusty Zleb canyon.SIROTEK,Jan, WEIGL,Josef, (2006) Speleological Mapping in the Northern Part of Moravian Karst History of discovery and of explorations One of the giant Stalagnate The history of explorations of the entire system already began in the early 18th century. Already in 1723 Lazarus Shopper realised the first descend into Macocha Abyss. In 1800 a first map of the Sloupsk√© Caves (the small lateral part of whole system only) was created. Systematic research began in the second half of the 19th century, when Dr.Jindrich Wankel and Martin Kriz published the first scientific studies of the Northern Part of Moravian Karst. Prof. Karel Absolons was the first to define a theoretical connection between the Sloupsko-sosuvske Caves, Nova Rasovna cave and Macocha gorge at the beginning of the 20th century. He spent his whole life working on the clarification of this speleological problem. He only partly succeeded, but Amatersk√° Cave as a main key to this problem was explored in 1969 by the Planivy Caving Club. In 18. January 1969 were main part of Amat√©rsk√° Cave (Star√°-The old) discovered. Catastrophic stormwater flooding 29. 8. 1970 and the deaths of amateur speleologists Milan ≈†lechta and Marko Zahradn√≠ƒçek after, gave name the cave. Within a short period of time, corridors connecting caves from a water sink in Nova Rasovna up to the resurgence in Punkevni cave were explored. The last unfinished part between Amaterska cave and the Sloupsko-sosuvecke Caves remained unexplored until 2005. The cave contains a Neolithic picture, currently the oldest cave painting known in the Czech Republic. It depicts a geometrical shape resembling a grill with a size of 30x40 cm, painted in charcoal on the cave wall. The carbon was dated with the C14 radio-carbon method to be 5,200 years old. The pattern resembles the decorations on some ceramic vessels from that period.

The title in the present tense points to the general lesson discussed in the prologue. The fable relates how an ambitious man suggests to his friend that they leave their small town together to seek their fortune. When his friend replies that he prefers to stay at home, the man departs to take up a position at Court. Not finding favour there, he next leaves to trade in the Orient but is no more successful. But when he gives up his pursuit and returns home at last, he find his friend in bed and Fortune sitting outside the door. Emblems and echoes An engraving by Felix Bracquemond of the ending of La Fontaine's fable, 1886 Although there is no known source for the story as such, it has been suggested that La Fontaine had in mind the French proverb la fortune vient en dormant (fortune comes while one sleeps),Andrew Calder, The Fables of La Fontaine: Wisdom Brought Down to Earth, Geneva CH, p.150 used of those who grow rich without exerting themselves.French Wiktionary A pictorial emblem was dedicated to this proposition in Guillaume Gu√©roult's Le premier livre des emblemes (1550), a book that is considered the source of several more of La Fontaine's fables.French Emblems at Glasgow Emblem 16 has the title Fortune favorise sans labour (Fortune favours those who labour not) and points out in an opening verse that the blind and inconstant goddess disdains those who work hard in her pursuit. The illustration features a naked huntsman and a sleeping monarch.Emblem 16 La Fontaine prefaces his fable with a meditation on the difficulties and uncertainties of chasing fortune and what motivates people to do so. As a notable example of success he does not mention an earthly monarch but, ‚Äú‚ÄòThat man,‚Äô say they, and feed their hope,/ ‚ÄòRaised cabbages ‚Äî and now he‚Äôs pope'\\". Commentators cite several popes of humble origin, of whom the one that La Fontaine probably had in mind was the most recent, Sixtus V, once a swineherd in his youth.Fables, Paris 1863, p.186 Charles Denis, the first English translator of this fable, paraphrased the text radically and shifted La Fontaine's preface to the end. There the Catholic reference is altered to something more in accord with his time: ‚ÄúHere is a fellow, you will say,/ Carried a knapsack t‚Äôother day, / In wretched, dismal, dirty plight,/ And now, forsooth, he‚Äôs dubb‚Äôd a Knight!‚ÄùSelect Fables (1754) p.341 La Fontaine himself, however, had then gone on to say in his preface that he prefers repose, which is the divine lot, an Epicurean doctrine according to the commentators. Commentators also point out echoes of Latin writers within the text.Fables de Jean de La Fontaine, Paris 1829, p.49 During his time at court, the fortune-seeker busies himself Se trouvant √† tout, et n‚Äôarrivant √† rien (being everywhere and getting nowhere), which may allude to the fable of ‚ÄúTiberius Caesar and his Slave‚Äù by Phaedrus. The slave there is described as Multa agendo, nihil agens, ‚Äúmightily employed and yet doing nothing‚Äù.The Fables of Phaedrus in Latin and English, II. 5 When the man decides to go trading, La Fontaine reflects on the bravery of those who sail the seas: ::O, human hearts are made of bronze! ::His must have been of adamant, ::Who ventured first this route to try. In this case the allusion is to lines in an ode of Horace, Illi robur et aes triplex circa pectus erat, qui fragilem truci commisit pelago ratem primus (Odes.1.3), which translates as ‚ÄúOak round his breast and triple brass, the sailor wore, whose bark first ventured on the sea.‚ÄùHorace, The Collected Works, London 1961, p.6; Lord Dunsany‚Äôs translation] An image relative to the meaning area of La Fontaine's fable appeared in Barth√©l√©my Aneau's emblem book Picta Poesis (1552) under the title Mulier Umbra Viri (man's feminine shadow). It pictures a man chasing his shadow while another is looking back at the shadow that the sun throws behind him, and is accompanied by a Latin poem: \\"As the shadow that follows its body through the sun‚Äôs radiant light flees as it follows and follows as it flees, so also are the loves of womankind. If you want it, they don‚Äôt; if you don‚Äôt, they don‚Äôt need asking.\\"French Emblems in Glasgow Much the same illustration was used by Theodore Beza in his Vrais Pourtraits (1581), but in this case relating to the pursuit of glory. The accompanying verse points out that glory (which is but a passing shadow) flees the proud but accompanies the humble person who does not seek fame.Emblem 14 In this is summed up the substance of La Fontaine's fable of those who, in his own words, ‚Äúcourt a flighty phantom‚Äù. He was himself followed at a distance by Ivan Krylov in that fabulist's more succinct but similar ‚ÄúThe Man and his Shadow‚Äù, in the concluding commentary to which there are verbal echoes of La Fontaine's preface.W.R.S.Ralston, Krilof and his Fables, London 1889, pp.59-60 References Category:La Fontaine's Fables ","title":"The Man who Runs after Fortune"},{"id":"49130776","text":"S√ºdwestkirchhof Stahnsdorf Maja Maranow (20 March 1961 - 4 January 2016) was a German actress.

While the traditional sweaters used the natural colors of sheep wool - black, gray, brown and white - Marius sweater designs incorporated colors, with the most common being red, white and blue, the colors of the Norwegian flag.  Origin  The origin of the sweater has been subject to dispute in media. Designer said she designed the pattern in 1953, influenced by traditional Norwegian knitting patterns found in the 1929 book Norske Strikkem√∏nstre (Norwegian knitting patterns) by Annichen Sibbern. She sold the legal rights to distribute the hand-knit pattern the same year to for 100 Norwegian kroner. Designer said she designed the pattern in the later 1920s, also inspired by the book by Sibbern, and that she in the beginning of 1950s had hired women who hand-knitted the sweater for sale in her shop. Erisen's daughter-in-law Bente Eriksen has said she was present when Dale visited Bitten Eriksen to learn the pattern Dale strongly disputed Bitten Eriksen's version, as does Dale's daughter, , who currently holds the rights to the pattern for most commercial use.  Popularity  Textile arts expert Annemor M√∏st estimated in 1999 that about 3,5 million copies of the knitting pattern had been sold and in 2008 estimated the number to be around 5 million and the number of sweaters that has been knitted based on the design as possibly multiple times more.

It is one of twenty Yoga Upanishads in the four Vedas. Its manuscripts are either attached to the Atharvaveda, or to the Krishna Yajurveda. The text includes sections on Yoga postures, breath exercises and withdrawal of senses from outside to inside as a means to cleanse the body and mind. The aim of Yoga, states the Upanishad, is to know and liberate one's soul. The text is also called K·π£urikopanishad. Etymology The Sanskrit word Kshurika means \\"razor\\", and in this Upanishad, it metaphorically signifies yoga being a tool to cut oneself away from Maya (illusion) and errors. A similar meaning to Kshurika is attributed in the Mundaka Upanishad. Chronology The text is ancient, states Mircea Eliade, who places its relative chronology to the same period when the following Hindu texts were composed - Maitri Upanishad, the didactic parts of the Mahabharata, the chief Sannyasa Upanishads and along with other early Yoga Upanishads such as Brahmabindu, Brahmavidya, Tejobindu, Yogatattva, Nadabindu, Yogashikha, Dhyanabindu and Amritabindu. These and the Kshurika text, adds Eliade, were composed earlier than the ten or eleven later yogic Upanishads such as the Yoga-kundali, Varaha and Pashupatabrahma Upanishads.Mircea Eliade (1970), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, , pages 128-129 Gavin Flood dates this text, along with other Yoga Upanishads, to be probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period. Anthology Kshurika Upanishadis listed at number 31 in the serial order of the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads. Colebrooke's version of 52 Upanishads, popular in north India, lists this Upanishad's text at number 4 The Narayana anthology also includes this Upanishad at number 4 in Bibliothica Indica. In the collection of Upanishads under the title \\"Oupanekhat\\", put together by Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikhoh in 1656, consisting of a Persian translation of 50 Upanishads and who prefaced it as the best book on religion, the Kshurika is listed at number 33 and is named Tschchourka According to Alain Dani√©lou, this Upanishad is one of the 10 Raja Yoga Upanishads, seven of which are under the Krishna Yajurveda and the balance 3 under the Shukla Yajurveda. Contents The text is composed in poetic prose style. It is notable for its discussion of concentration of mind during meditation, stating that mind is the Kshurika (razor) that can cut away worldly distractions and external sense objects during Dharana step of Yoga. It calls it the Dhyana-yoga. The Upanishad also includes sections on Asana (posture), Pranayama (breath exercises) and Pratyahara (withdrawal of senses from outside to inside) as a means to cleanse the body and mind. The aim of Yoga, describes the Upanishad, is to know and liberate one's soul. Yogic meditation, states the Kshurika Upanishad, is the razor that helps severe the mind from the changing reality and worldly cravings, achieve self-knowledge and liberation from Samsara (rebirth).

It premiered on Adult Swim on December 9, 2013, was written by Ryan Ridley, and directed by John Rice. In the episode, Rick gives Jerry a device to enhance the dog's intelligence while Rick and Morty get lost in the dreams of Morty's math teacher. The episode was well received, with approximately 1.5 million viewers when airing. The title is a reference to the movie The Lawnmower Man (1992), in which a scientist enhances the intellect of a simple-minded gardener. Meanwhile, the plot involving Rick and Morty's adventure is a reference to the 2010 film Inception as well as the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. Plot Morty's dog Snuffles angers Jerry by continuously peeing on the carpet. Upset, Jerry asks Rick for a device that could make Snuffles smarter. Rick makes the device, and it makes Snuffles smart enough for him to be able to do things like a normal human, like going to the bathroom. Meanwhile, Rick plans to enter the dreams of Morty's math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, in order for him to increase Morty's grades, thus letting Morty adventure with Rick more often. The two enter Goldenfold's dream. The dream takes place on a plane, where Rick pretends to be a terrorist threatening to blow them up if Goldenfold does not give Morty better grades, but Goldenfold decides to fight back and pulls out two machine guns. Rick realizes that Goldenfold has more control over his dreams than he had anticipated, and also reveals that if they die in the dream, they die in real life. Meanwhile, Snuffles attempts to communicate with his owners verbally but is unable. He opens the battery compartment on the helmet and realizes that it can be boosted with additional batteries. Still stuck in the dream, Rick tries to negotiate with Goldenfold using his idol, Mrs. Pancakes, as a human shield. Instead, chaos descends on the plane. The doors to the plane are opened, and everyone gets sucked out. Mrs. Pancakes finds a parachute and opens it, while Goldenfold has already landed the plane. Rick and Morty grab onto Pancakes, but Goldenfold has created a device to pluck Pancakes out of the sky and leave Rick and Morty to fall in a pool of lava. The two then incept themselves into Pancakes' dreams to slow time down. Pancakes' dreams are of an intergalactic sex club and S&M; dungeon, filled with dominatrices. A lingerie-clad Summer makes the two feel uncomfortable, making them stand out. A centaur guard threatens to kill them, and they venture into the centaur's dream, where the three have to run away from a \\"legally safe knockoff\\" of Freddy Krueger, named Scary Terry. Meanwhile, Snuffles has created a robotic arm and a speaker that he uses to grab things and communicate, albeit in broken English. Snuffles' view on life changes after watching a TV special about dogs being domesticated and being forced into subservience. Still finding an escape, Rick and Morty travel into a little girl's dream to escape Scary Terry. After returning to what looks like the same dream, the two also find out that Terry can travel across dreams. After building himself a powerful robotic suit, Snuffles changes his name to Snowball and assumes dominance over the household. While in a new dream, Rick and Morty are still being chased by Terry. The two follow him back into his house and enter his dreams. They see that he is fearful of being a failure in his job and save him from being embarrassed in school. In return, he helps them return to reality, and in the process, convince Goldenfold to raise Morty's grades. Back in the regular world, they find that Snowball has led an army of hyper-intelligent dogs to the verge of global domination over humanity. Snowball allows Morty to live by his side while the rest of the world are entrapped and enslaved under the whim of the dogs. While the dogs are subjecting the humans to similar practices the humans subjected the dogs to, Morty lives in luxury. Rick reveals to him that the two are actually in Snowball's dream. Rick poisons Morty's kidneys, making Snowball care for Morty's health. Snowball comes out of his dream and realizes that oppressing humans brings heartbreak and cruelty. Snowball and the dogs change their plan and decide instead to inhabit a world of their own. In the post-credits scene, the old teacher of Scary Terry's class has been replaced by Scary Glenn, a hippie drum player. Rick and Scary Terry are sitting as his students, smoking marijuana, satisfied with this change. Reception The A.V. Club gave the episode an A rating, with reviewer Zach Handlen noting that it was the \\"pinnacle of the show thus far\\". Junkey Monkey's reviewer William Manzo praised the episode, saying that the episode was \\"a welcome surprise when compared to the pilot\\", giving it a 10/10.

Returning to California, he earned a degree at Chico State University.http://webpages.csus.edu/~boblocke/extext/My%20Brother%20the%20Porn%20Star.htm Career Locke's first gay film was Dreamer for the director Jim West in 1975. In a December 1992 interview for Manshots, recalling how he was asked to pick a screen pseudonym for billing, Locke said, \\"They asked me, 'What name do you want?, 'and I said, ‚ÄòMy name.‚Äò I'm very proud of my work and everything I do. An artist signs his name to the canvas, and I sign my name.\\" Tall, well built, and ruggedly handsome, Locke became a popular film star before he even realized it, partly because he worked for auteur directors who marketed their movies as if they were mainstream Hollywood productions.

He took education at the American Red Cross and the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York City, then used his name and celebrity to make personal appearances at sensible sex seminars around the country. Eventually, Locke moved back to Desert Hot Springs near Palm Springs, California. In 1975 he had settled on an old soldier settlement property and built a geodesic domed home, powered by electricity from his own windmill. He did volunteer work from the Desert AIDS Project and gave weekly messages at the Villa Caprice Hotel in nearby Cathedral City. When his health began failing in February 1996, he moved to an apartment in Sacramento to be close to his family and the medical facilities at UC Davis Medical Center. Locke was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the 1994 Gay Erotic Video Awards in Los Angeles. He returned to the screen in 1995 to play a non-sexual role in Jerry Douglas' The Diamond Stud, which was his last appearance. He also wrote the books Locke Out, In The Heat Of Passion. He was working on two unfinished autobiographies, Living and Dying. His one-act play, Loving, was filmed in 1995 in Toronto for future release.

He experimented with new farming methods on his estate at Tiptree in Essex. Mechi was born in London 22 May 1802, the third son of Giacomo Mechi, a citizen of Bologna, who had settled in England early in life, was naturalised, and obtained a post at Kensington Palace in the household of George III. His mother was Elizabeth, daughter of J. Beyer of Poland Street, London. John at the age of sixteen was placed as a clerk in a house in Walbrook, trading with Newfoundland, a job he had for ten years. In 1828 he set up on his own account as a cutler in a small workshop at 130 Leadenhall Street, from where he removed to No. 4 in the same street in 1830. Between 1830 and 1840 he made his fortune through the 'magic razor strop' which bears his name After the Crimean war and a fashion for beards, sales declined. On 10 November 1840 he took out a patent for 'improvements in apparatus to be applied to lamps in order to carry off heat and the products of consumption'. This was for the external shop-window lamps. From 1859 to 1869 he was in partnership with Charles Bazan, and then gave up his city business and moved to 112, Regent Street. In 1841, after studying English farming, he became interested in improvements in agriculture, and accordingly purchased a farm of about 130 acres, including Tiptree Hall, at Tiptree Heath, one of the least productive districts in Essex. Here he tried deep drainage and the application of steam power, and made the farm profitable. The press acknowledged the services he had rendered to agricultural science by the introduction of modern processes into his model farm. He was appointed to the shrievalty of London in 1856, and in 1858 elected an alderman of the city. He was a member of the council of the Society of Arts, and was a juror in the department of art and science at The Great Exhibition of 1851 and at the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1855. His 1857 publication, How to Farm Profitably, had in various forms a circulation of ten thousand copies. The failure of the Unity Joint Stock Bank in 1866, of which he was a governor, and an unfortunate connection with the Unity Fire and General Life Assurance Office, caused him such heavy losses that, instead of becoming Lord Mayor of London, he was in August 1866 obliged to resign his aldermanic gown. Many bad seasons followed at Tiptree farm, particularly that of 1879, and at last, worn out with diabetes and broken-hearted, his affairs were put in liquidation on 14 December 1880. He died at Tiptree Hall on 26 December 1880, and was buried in Tiptree Church on 1 January 1881. He was married twice; firstly, in 1823, to Fanny Frost, and secondly, in 1846, Charlotte, daughter of Francis Ward of Chillesford, Suffolk. A subscription was made for his widow and daughters.

Rosenberg (born 1945) is an American physician and public health researcher who is the current president and CEO of the Task Force for Global Health, where he began working in 1999. He is also on the faculty at Morehouse School of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, and the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. He previously worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), where he helped oversee research on gun violence through the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC). Education Rosenberg received his undergraduate degree, as well as degrees in public policy and medicine, at Harvard University. He completed a residency in internal medicine and a fellowship in infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, a residency in psychiatry at the Boston Beth Israel Hospital, and a residency in preventive medicine at CDC. Career at the CDC Rosenberg worked at the CDC for 20 years, where he was instrumental in founding the NCIPC. He also served as the first permanent director of the NCIPC beginning in 1994. While there, he was responsible for overseeing gun violence research at the CDC prior to the enactment of the 1996 Dickey Amendment, the Congressional restriction which prevented the CDC from using its funding \\"to advocate or promote gun control,\\" in 1996. Specifically, advocates of the restrictions referred to comments Rosenberg made in 1994: in a Washington Post article, he was quoted as saying ‚ÄúWe need to revolutionize the way we look at guns, like we did with cigarettes. Now it [sic] is dirty, deadly and banned.‚Äù The same year Dr. Katherine Christoffel, head of the CDC funded Handgun Epidemic Lowering Plan, said in an interview with American Medical News \\"guns are a virus that must be eradicated....\\" In the same interview Rosenberg concurred with Christoffel, saying \\"...she‚Äôs not willing to be silent anymore. She‚Äôs asking for help.‚Äù For his part, Rosenberg has been highly critical of this restriction, saying in 2012 that the National Rifle Association (which lobbied Congress to enact this restriction) has \\"terrorized\\" the scientific community. He has also said this restriction has impaired researchers' ability to understand the problem of gun violence, saying in 2015 that ‚ÄúBecause we don‚Äôt know what works, we as a country are left in a shouting match.‚Äù In a 2016 article in The Atlantic on the impact of the Dickey Amendment, Rosenberg says: ‚ÄúIt was the leadership of CDC who stopped the agency from doing gun violence research ... Right now, there is nothing stopping them from addressing this life-and-death national problem.\\" As the article notes this assertion runs counter to the \\"conventional wisdom\\" of the Dickey Amendment \\"as blocking the agency [i.e. the CDC] from conducting research on firearms deaths and injuries.\\" Honors and awards In 1995, Rosenberg was elected a member of the Institute of Medicine.

The fatwa sets out detailed relaxations of the sharia (Islamic law) requirements, allowing the Muslims to conform outwardly to Christianity and perform acts that are ordinarily forbidden in Islamic law, when necessary to survive. It includes relaxed instructions for fulfilling the ritual prayers, the ritual charity, and the ritual ablution, and recommendations when obliged to violate Islamic law, such as worshipping as Christians, committing blasphemy, and consuming pork and wine. The fatwa enjoyed wide currency among Muslims and Moriscos (Muslims nominally converted to Christianity and their descendants) in Spain, and one of the surviving aljamiado translations was dated at 1564, 60years after the original fatwa. The fatwa has been described as the \\"key theological document\\" to understand the practice of Spanish Muslims following the Reconquista up to the expulsion of the Moriscos. The author of the fatwa (mufti) was Ahmad ibn Abi Jum'ah, a North African scholar of Islamic law of the Maliki school. The fatwa was termed the \\"Oran fatwa\\" by modern scholars, due to the word \\"Al-Wahrani\\" (\\"of Oran\\") that appears in the text as part of the author's name. The influence of the fatwa was limited to Spain. Outside the Iberian Peninsula, the predominant opinion upheld the requirements of Islamic law and required Muslims to emigrate, or even choose martyrdom, when the orthodox observance of the religion became impossible.  Background  Islam has been present in Spain since the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in the eighth century. At the beginning of the twelfth century, the Muslim population in the Iberian Peninsula ‚Äî called \\"Al-Andalus\\" by the Muslims ‚Äî was estimated to number up to 5.5 million, among whom were Arabs, Berbers and indigenous converts. In the next few centuries, as the Christians pushed from the north in a process called reconquista, the Muslim population declined. At the end of the fifteenth century, the reconquista culminated in the fall of Granada, and the total number of Muslims in Spain was estimated to be between 500,000 and 600,000 out of the total Spanish population of 7 to 8 million. Approximately half of the Muslims lived in the former Emirate of Granada, the last independent Muslim state in Spain, which had been annexed to the Crown of Castile. About 20,000 Muslims lived in other territories of Castile, and most of the remainder lived in the territories of the Crown of Aragon. Cardinal Cisneros. Prior to the completion of the reconquista, the defeated Muslims were generally given freedom of religion as terms of their surrender. For example, the Treaty of Granada, which governed the surrender of the emirate, guaranteed a set of rights to the conquered Muslims, including religious tolerance and fair treatment, in return for their capitulation. The increasing occurrences of forced conversion triggered a series of Muslim rebellions in Granada (1499‚Äì1501). The rebellions were suppressed, and afterwards the Muslims in Granada were no longer given the rights that had been provided to them by the Treaty of Granada. They were given the choice to remain and accept baptism, to reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or to be exiled. The option of exile was often not feasible in practice because of the difficulty in uprooting one's family and making the journey to Muslim lands in North Africa, the inability to pay the fee required by the authorities for safe passage, and the general tendency by the authorities to discourage and hinder such an exodus. Some Muslims, especially those living near the southern coast, took the option of exile, but for most, publicly converting to Christianity while secretly continuing to believe and practise Islam was the only available option for surviving as Muslims. The population converted en masse, and by 1501 the entire Muslim population of Granada was nominally converted to Christianity. The apparent success of Granada's forced conversions triggered a series of edicts and proclamations in 1501 and 1502 which effectively put the Muslims elsewhere in Castile to the same fate. These new converts, along with their descendants, were known by Spanish sources as the Moriscos. As well as having to accept Christianity and abandon the Islamic faith and rituals, they were also pressured to conform to Christian ways, including by attending church, sending their children to be instructed in the Christian doctrine, and partaking of food and beverages forbidden by Islamic law. = Previous Islamic legal opinions = Prior to the Oran fatwa, the predominant position of Islamic scholars had been that a Muslim could not stay in a country where rulers made proper religious observance impossible. Therefore, a Muslim's obligation was to leave, when they were able to do so. Even before the systematic forcible conversion, religious leaders had argued that Muslims in Christian territory would be subject to direct and indirect pressure, and preached emigration as a way to protect the religion from erosion. Notably, the contemporary North African scholar Ahmad al-Wansharisi, who was considered the leading authority on the subject of Muslims in Spain, wrote in 1491 that emigrating from Christian to Muslim lands was compulsory in almost all circumstances. Further, Al-Wansharisi urged severe punishment for the Muslims who remained and predicted that they would temporarily dwell in hell in the afterlife.  Authorship  The surviving translations of the fatwa give the name of the author in various slightly different forms. All of them are thought to be derived from the Arabic name Ahmad ibn Abi Jum'ah al-Maghrawi al-Wahrani, with some adding the name 'Ubaydallah, which might be a pious formula meaning \\"the little servant of God\\". The author's nisba ‚Äî the part of his name that indicates place of origin ‚Äî al-Wahrani (\\"of Oran\\") refers to the city of Oran (,Wahran) in modern-day Algeria, then part of the Zayyanid kingdom of Tlemcen. Thus, the author is often referred to as \\"the Mufti of Oran\\" and the document is called \\"the Oran fatwa\\", even though there appeared to be no indication that the fatwa was issued in Oran or that the author resided or had an official authority in Oran. Devin Stewart, an academic specialist in Islamic studies, identified the author as Abu al-Abbas Ahmad ibn Abi Jum'ah al-Maghrawi al-Wahrani (b.unknownd.1511 in Fez), a Maliki jurist who had studied in Oran and Tlemcen and probably issued the fatwa in Fez while a professor of Islamic law there. Al-Wahrani drafted the fatwa in response to a request of legal opinion, in other words, as a responsum, to Muslim petitioners who wished to learn if they could continue to live in Christian Spain. The recipient of the fatwa is not named. The commonly accepted date of the composition of the fatwa is 1Rajab 910AH, as this was the date that appears in most of the surviving manuscripts. This day in the Islamic calendar corresponds to around 8December 1504. One manuscript added \\"3May 1563\\" in addition to 1Rajab 910, which would have been a date conversion error, but both Stewart and the historian L. P. Harvey have suggested that the 1563 date might have been the time of the translation. One other manuscript gives \\"Rajab909\\", which was probably a copying error.  Content  The opening of the fatwa displayed sympathy to the Muslims of Spain, who kept their religious faith despite the suffering and risk that this posed them. The mufti (author of the fatwa) exhorted that they continue to adhere to the religion of Islam and instruct it to their children when the latter reached maturity. The fatwa reaffirmed the obligation of Spanish Muslims to perform the ritual prayers (salat), the ritual charity (zakat), and the ritual ablution (ghusl), even if they could not be performed in the correct form. It described the obligation of the ritual prayersnormally performed by standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting in a prescribed sequenceeven if done only by making slight movements. The fatwa also allowed the omission of the prayersnormally performed an obligatory five times a day at prescribed timeswhen they were prevented from doing so, and instructed them to make up the missed prayers at night instead. It also provided instructions for performing the ritual dry ablution (tayammum) when ritually pure water was not available, to replace the ritual ablution (wudu) that is ordinarily required before performing the salat. When tayammum was not possible, even making slight pointing motions with hands or face toward clean earth, stone, or tree was acceptable. The fatwa also maintained the Islamic obligation to give the ritual charity (zakat)normally calculated and distributed in a specific manner prescribed by the sharia (Islamic law)even if this could only be done by showing generosity to a beggar. It affirmed the obligation of the ritual ablution (ghusl), \\"even though by plunging into the sea\\". The fatwa permitted Muslims outwardly to participate in Christian rituals and worship, so long as they inwardly considered them to be forbidden. When the Muslims had to prostrate to Christian \\"idols\\", they were to internally desire to perform the Islamic prayer, even if not actually facing Mecca, and when they bowed down to the \\"idols\\", they were to focus their attention toward Allah. When obliged to commit blasphemy, such as cursing Muhammad, or accepting Jesus as the son of God or Mary as God's wife [sic], the fatwa instructed them to do so, and to employ \\"whatever stratagems\\" they could to negate their meaning whenever possible. For example, the fatwa suggested mispronouncing the name of Muhammad, or intending to curse someone else with a similar name, when being required to curse the prophet. The fatwa also allowed Spain's Muslims to consume wine, pork, and other things normally forbidden by the sharia, as long as the Muslims did not intend to take advantage of them and rejected them in their hearts. The fatwa reaffirmed the permissibility of a Muslim man marrying a Christian woman, under the reasoning that both Muslims and Christians were People of the Book. Marriage between a Muslim woman and a Christian man was to be avoided unless under duress, and while doing so the Muslims should \\"cleave firmly to the belief that that is forbidden\\". At the end of the fatwa, the author encouraged the Muslims to write to the mufti about anything else that presented difficulty to them, so that he could give further legal opinions. The fatwa discreetly did not name any specific recipient, and instead designated the persons it was addressed to by \\"al-guraba\\" (those living abroad) yet near to Allah.  Reactions = Impact in Spain = expulsion from Spain in 16091614, depicted in The Expulsion at the Port of Denia by Vicente Mostre, 1613. The fatwa appeared to enjoy wide currency within the Muslim and Morisco community in various kingdoms of Spain, for it was translated and copied as late as 1563 and 1609. The full geographical reach of the text is unknown, but it appeared to be originally addressed to the Muslims (or Moriscos) of Castile as a response to their forced conversions in 1500‚Äì1502. After the forced conversion was extended to the Crown of Aragon in the 1520s, the fatwa likely circulated there, too. The opinion formed the basis of the Moriscos' Islamic status and practices for more than a century, until their expulsion in 1609‚Äì1614. This led to a non-traditional form of Islam, in which one's internal intention (niyya), rather than external observation of rituals and laws, was the defining characteristic of one's Islam. Generations of Moriscos were born and died within this religious climate. Hybrid or undefined religious practice featured in many Morisco texts. For example, the works of the Morisco writer known as \\"the Young Man of Ar√©valo\\", written c.1530s described crypto-Muslims using Christian worship as replacement for regular Islamic rituals, as recommended in the fatwa. The influence of the fatwa was limited to Spain. Outside the Iberian Peninsula, the predominant opinion continued to uphold the unbending requirements of Islamic law and required Muslims to leave any country, or even choose martyrdom, where approved observance of the religion became impossible. = Scholarly analysis = Modern scholars of Spanish Islamic history stressed the historical importance of the fatwa. Harvey called it \\"the key theological document\\" for the study of Spanish Islam following the forced conversions, a description which Stewart repeated. Mercedes Garc√≠a-Arenal and Fernando Rodr√≠guez Mediano, historians of Spain and Western Muslims, described the fatwa as \\"famous\\" and called it \\"one of the most important theological texts of later Spanish Islam\\". Spanish literature scholar Mar√≠a del Mar Rosa- Rodr√≠guez considered the fatwa important because it officially documented \\"the existence of religiosities that do not depend on traditional ritual practice\\". Harvey and Stewart said that the fatwa was a departure from the previous legal opinions among Islamic scholars, which typically emphasised the obligation to emigrate from any country where proper religious observance was not possible. Notably, the Maliki scholar al-Wansharisi, the leading living authority on the issue, was among the proponents of this view. Stewart contended that, while the fatwa's text did not mention any opponent, it was intended as a rebuke against the views of al-Wansharisi. Recipients of this fatwa would be able to stay put, outwardly conforming to Christianity and not see themselves as abandoning their faith. The fatwa addressed the recipient as \\"al-guraba\\", a word that means \\"outsiders\\" or \\"those living abroad\\", but this word also appears in several hadiths (sayings of Muhammad) and evokes a spiritual meaning of heroic Muslims loyal to their faith in spite of great suffering. The sympathy shown by the author, as well as his acknowledgement of the Muslims' loyalty and suffering, is in contrast with the predominant opinion such as al-Wansharisi's which saw them unfavourably. Harvey did not consider the fatwa as a permanent and universal relaxation of the sharia; instead, the sender and the recipients of the fatwa must have seen its provisions as temporary expedients under extraordinary circumstances intended to help the Muslims of Spain through the crisis. The fatwa began by affirming in orthodox terms the obligations of all Muslims, and ended by expressing hopes that Islam may again be practised openly without ordeals, tribulations and fear. The mufti and many Moriscos expected or hoped that the crisis to end at some not- too-distant time. Rosa-Rodriguez noted that the fatwa stated a hope that the \\"Noble Turks\\" would soon intervene and end the religious persecution in Spain, a reference to the Ottoman Empire's growing power in the Mediterranean at the time. This hope did not materialise, and the religious persecution in Spain continued, causing the fatwa's recommendations to become the normal way of practicing Islam for generations. Harvey also noted that the fatwa covered a wide range of Islamic religious duties, while usually a responsum fatwa only addresses a specific enquiry on a difficult point of detail. The fatwa also went into specific practical challenges faced by Muslims in Spain, such as the pressure to curse Muhammad, eat pork, drink wine, and intermarry with the Christians. This suggests that the author had some knowledge of what life under Christian rule was like. = In popular culture = Amin Maalouf's 1986 novel Leo Africanus features a fictionalised version of the fatwa. In the novel, Muslim exiles from Granada and the local ulama (Islamic scholars) held meetings in Fez to provide counsel to the Muslims in Granada, who sent letters describing their persecution and their dilemma. Amid the meetings, the protagonist of the novel witnessed the \\"man from Oran\\" delivering a speech similar in content to the Oran fatwa.  Surviving manuscripts  The Vatican Library, which houses the only surviving Arabic copy of the fatwa As of 2006, there are four known surviving manuscripts containing the fatwa. One of them is an Arabic copy, discovered by Muhammad Abdullah 'Inan in the Vatican in 1951 and kept in the Borgiano collection of the Vatican Library. The other three were translations to Spanish written in the Arabic script (aljamiado). One of them was kept in Aix-en-Provence, France, and one in Madrid, Spain. The third aljamiado translation used to be in Madrid, but its location is currently unknown. Since the discovery, the texts have been transcribed or translated into modern Spanish, English and German. Historian L. P. Harvey provides a near-complete English translation in his book Muslims in Spain, 1500 to 1615.

It originally aired on February 16, 2012. The episode was written by Evan Bleiweiss & Michael Narducci and directed by Pascal Verschooris. Plot Elijah (Daniel Gillies) finds evidence that Esther (Alice Evans) was casting a spell during the ball and he believes that Elena (Nina Dobrev) lied to him. He kidnaps Elena who tells him that Esther wants to kill them all. Elijah takes Elena into the tunnels and asks Rebekah (Claire Holt) to watch her and kill her if Stefan (Paul Wesley) and Damon (Ian Somerhalder) do not manage to stop Esther in time. Elijah tells Damon and Stefan to stop Esther from completing her plan otherwise Elena will die. In the meantime, Esther asks for Bonnie (Kat Graham) and Abby‚Äôs (Persia White) help to complete the spell, Esther needs to channel power from all the dead witches of the Bennett bloodline. Once the spell is cast, the Original vampires will become humans again and Finn (Casper Zafer) is willing to sacrifice himself for his mother' cause. When Finn dies, all will die since they are linked as one. Stefan and Damon try to kill Kol (Nathaniel Buzolic), thinking that since the Originals are linked, if they kill him then all the Originals will die. They stab him and everyone collapses except Klaus (Joseph Morgan) who is a hybrid and the dagger does not affect him. Klaus finds Alaric (Matt Davis), Stefan and Damon while they are carrying Kol and removes the dagger. While Rebekah is down, Elena gets an opportunity and runs away getting to the cave where vampires cannot get in and protects herself. Damon and Stefan try to find another way to stop Esther and they decide that they have to break the Bennett bloodline so Esther will not be able to channel their power. They attack Bonnie and Abby and Damon turns Abby into a vampire just in time to stop Esther from completing her spell. Esther and Finn disappear, Rebekah lets Elena go and all the Original siblings, except Rebekah, decide to leave town leaving Klaus behind. Stefan asks Damon why he turned Abby when he was the one supposed to do it and Damon says because he can see that Stefan is trying to get back to his caring self. When Damon asks him how long it has been since he last fed on human blood, Stefan admits that he has not fed on human blood since the day he tried to drive Elena off the bridge. Elijah sends Elena a message apologizing for kidnapping her while Rebekah tells Klaus the old white oak tree has grown back and it can be used by someone to kill them. The episode ends with Alaric finding that Meredith (Torrey DeVitto) has vampire weapons, like the ones that were used to kill Brian and Bill. Meredith sees him and shoots him telling him that he was not supposed to see that.

It was intriguing, smart, fun, and very well-executed. All of this great build-up ultimately just made tonight‚Äôs easy resolution and scattering of the Originals like leaves to the wind without any sort of resolution that much more disappointing.\\" Matt Richenthal from TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.6/5 saying that it was a heart-pounding episode full of both action and emotion. \\"There really is no black or white anymore on The Vampire Diaries. The show has created such a well-layered, fascinating universe that viewers can endlessly debate the choices various characters make.\\" Diana Steenbergen from IGN rated the episode with 8/10 saying that after last week's revelation of Esther's plan, she is now moving forward very quickly to put it into motion. \\"The main problem with Esther moving so quickly on her plan to kill the Originals was that there wasn't enough time for tension in this storyline to build. I wasn't at all surprised when the spell fizzled out.\\" E.

This sense of \\"meeting\\" may be different from the general sense in that a meeting in general may not necessarily be conducted for the purpose of making decisions. Each meeting may be a separate session or not part of a group of meetings constituting a session. Meetings vary in their frequency, with certain actions being affected depending on whether the meetings are held more than a quarterly time interval apart. There are different types of meetings, such as a regular meeting, special meeting, or annual meeting. Each meeting may have an agenda, which lists the business that is to come up during the meeting. A record of the meeting is summarized in the minutes.  Session  A session is a meeting or series of connected meetings devoted to a single order of business, program, agenda, or announced purpose.See dictionary definition of \\"session\\" at thefreedictionary.com. An organization's bylaws may define a specific meaning of the term \\"session.\\" In most organizations, each session consists of only a single meeting (i.e. \\"session\\" and \\"meeting\\" are equivalent terms in this case). The significance of a session is that one session generally cannot make decisions that bind a group at a future session. A session has implications for the renewability of motions. The same or substantially the same question cannot be brought up twice in the same session except by means of the motions that bring a question again before the assembly.  Quarterly time interval  A quarterly time interval represents a time limitation on the taking or postponement of certain actions. No more than a quarterly time interval between two sessions exists when \\"the second session begins at any time during or before the third calendar month after the calendar month in which the first session ends.\\" For example, if a meeting takes place in January, the other meeting is within a quarterly time interval when the previous meeting is on or after October 1 of the preceding calendar year or when the next meeting occurs on or before April 30 of the current year. A motion may not be postponed to the next meeting if that meeting is scheduled for more than a quarterly time interval away. If a body's next meeting is more than a quarterly time interval away, it is customary to appoint a board or committee to approve the minutes of the current meeting. A motion which has been laid on the table at a meeting and not taken from the table before the end of the meeting will die if the next meeting is more than a quarterly time interval away, whereas if the next meeting is within a quarterly time interval, the motion may be taken from the table at that meeting.  Types of meetings  Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised describes the following types of meetings: * Regular meeting - a meeting normally scheduled by the organization at set intervals. For example, it could be a weekly or monthly meeting of the organization. * Special meeting - a meeting scheduled separately from a regular meeting, as the need arises. * Adjourned meeting - a meeting that is continued from a regular meeting or a special meeting (also called a \\"continued meeting\\"). This meeting is scheduled by a motion to do so. * Annual meeting - a meeting held every year. This meeting may be different from the regular meetings in that there may be elections or annual reports from officers that only take place at such a meeting. * Executive session - a meeting in which the proceedings are secret, or confidential. * Public session - a meeting, usually of a governmental body, that is open to the general public. For government bodies, such meetings may be required to be open to the public due to open meeting laws. * Electronic meetings - a meeting held by electronic means, such as the internet. Any of the above types of meetings could also be held as an \\"electronic\\" meeting. Groups may also gather at conventions which may have several meetings over a day or a week or more. The conventions may be held in connection with the organization's annual meeting.  Call of the meeting  A \\"call\\" of the meeting is a notice of the time and place which is sent in advance to inform the members.See dictionary definition of \\"call a meeting\\" at thefreedictionary.com. Usually the secretary of the organization is responsible for sending out the call. The call may also include an agenda or a listing of items of business to come up at the meeting. Organizations may have a requirement of how much notice is needed for the call. For example, a call may be required to be sent at least 30 days in advance of the meeting. This sense of a \\"call\\" of the meeting is distinct from \\"calling the meeting to order\\", which means that the meeting is beginning.  Agenda  An agenda is a list of meeting activities in the order in which they are to be taken up, beginning with the call to order and ending with adjournment. It usually includes one or more specific items of business to be acted upon. It may, but is not required to, include specific times for one or more activities.  Procedures for conducting a meeting  Organizations have their own rules on conducting meetings. Most organizations in the United States use Robert's Rules of Order as a supplemental guide to their rules. Outside of the United States, organizations may follow rules that are similar to those in Parliament.  Minutes  Minutes, also known as protocols or, informally, notes, are the instant written record of a meeting or hearing. They typically describe the events of the meeting and may include a list of attendees, a statement of the issues considered by the participants, and related responses or decisions for the issues.

It separated the R√≠o de la Plata Craton from the Congo Craton. The inversion of the Adamastor Ocean began about 640 Ma with the development of a large back-arc basin along the western margin of the Kalahari Craton, and the ocean closed when R√≠o de la Plata collided with Kalahari about 545 Ma along the sinistral Sierra Ballena Shear Zone. The S√£o Francisco Craton and the R√≠o de la Plata Craton amalgamated 630‚Äì620 Ma, closing the Adamastor Ocean on the South American side and forming the Mantiqueira Mountains around 600 Ma. In 2020 a group of geologists proposed an alternative model for the Adamastor Ocean in which it is reduced to a intracontinental rift system with only some minor oceanic crust developing in its southern part.  Etymology  South African geologist Chris Hartnady named the Precambrian ocean after the mythical giant Adamastor from Lu√≠s de Cam√µes's poem Os Lus√≠adas which celebrates Vasco da Gama's discovery of the sea route to India. Hartnady thought it an appropriate name since the demigod was transformed into stone and personified the Cape of Storms and since Atlas and Iapetus are associated with the oceans of the northern Atlantic, the North Atlantic Ocean and the Iapetus Ocean respectively.  Geological history  The Adamastor Ocean was narrow in the north, perhaps similar to the Red Sea, but widened southward. C isotope analyses indicate that the ocean water was strongly stratified and thus that it must have been a closed ocean, similar to the Mediterranean, but probably covered by ice during the Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations. Ocean floor adjacent to the Marmora Terrane (near the Orange River in South Africa) formed 740‚Äì580 Ma, dates that represent the first rifting and the first accretion respectively. The Adamastor Ocean closed in three episodes: the R√≠o de la Plata Craton first collided with the Congo Craton, which then collided with the Kalahari Craton, which finally collided with R√≠o de la Plata.

This is contingent that in order to collecting traditions Ibn Qulawayh travelled to Baghdad and Egypt. kamil al-ziyarat had been used for developing of some reliable sources like al-Mazar by Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid, Tahdhib al-Ahkam and al-Istibsar by Shaykh Tusi, Bihar al-Anwar, Mustadrak al-Wasa'el and Wasa'el ash-Shi'a. Context Kamil al-ziyarat is known as other titles such as al-ziyarat, kamal al-ziyarat but the author had considered kamil al-ziyarat for this book. It contains 843 traditions that set up in 801 chapters. The shia nature of the kamil al-ziyarat became apparent in some specific chapters of the book. There is 52 traditions at 8-15 chapters associated to Ziyarat of Imam Ali‚Äôs grave. Also 69 per cent of tradition are related to visiting of Husayn ibn Ali‚Äôs grave. This book contains following subjects: *The charity of visiting ( ZiyƒÅrah ) the Muhammad prophet‚Äôs grave *The charity and manner of the visiting of the grave of Ali ibn Abi Talib * The charity and manner of the visiting of the grave of Hassan ibn Ali * The charity and manner of the visiting of the grave of Husayn ibn Ali, the charity of Mourning for him *The manner of the visiting of the graves of Musa al- Kadhim and Muhammad al-Jawad *The manner of the visiting of graves of the others The Fourteen Infallibles *The manner of the visiting of graves of the believers *The manner of the visiting of graves of the Imamzadeh (an immediate descendant of a Shia Imam ) Manuscripts The following version are available: *At the library of Islamic Consultative Assembly, written by Mohammad Shafi Rahmani, in 1083 AH *At the Central Library of Astan Quds Razavi, written by Abu al-Qasim Najafi See also *List of Shi'a books *The Four Books *Al-Kafi *Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih* References Category:Hadith collections Category:Arabic-language books ","title":"Kamil al-Ziyarat"},{"id":"49131581","text":"New Horizon Institute (Nepali : ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç ‡§π‡•ã‡§∞‡§æ‡§à‡§ú‡§® ‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡§ø‡§ö‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å‡§ü) was established in year 1989 AD (2046 BS) by the group of educationists, teachers, social workers, and businessman under the leadership of Late Mr. MeLal Chandra Shrestha.It is a successful institution that has produced great intellectuals, scientist and sportsman.

Geography Located approximately above sea level, the glacier covers more than of the surrounding landscape. It terminates at the head of two river valleys, the Slims and the Kaskawulsh River, which feed the Yukon River (via Kluane Lake) and Alsek River systems respectively. The Kaskawulsh is the result of two converging outlet glaciers, the Central and North Arms, and is an impressive wide at its broadest point.  Waterflow  Until 2016, abundant melt water from the Kaskawulsh was channeled by ice dam to drain through the Slims River, north to Kluane Lake, and ultimately to the Bering Sea. In 2016, as the glacier receded, the predominant flow abruptly switched to the Kaskawulsh River, flowing east and then south to Alsek River and to the Gulf of Alaska. As the water level at Kluane Lake continues to drop, researchers expect this will become an isolated lake cut off from any outflow.  Tourism Terminus of the Kaskawulsh Glacier Backpackers can visit the Kaskawulsh along the popular Slims River West Trail, which follows the Slims River south for before ending at the summit of Observation Mountain near the toe of the glacier.

Life Hervieu was born near Paris in about 1794 into a French family. His father was a colonel in the army of Napoleon. He studied at military school until his father's death, when he went to study art under Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson. He was exiled from France in 1823 for his anti-royalist politics in the time of Louis XVIII, and he moved to England. He worked in London as a painter and illustrator. As a young man trying to make his living, he travelled to America in November 1827 with the writer Frances Trollope as her children's tutor: one of the children was the novelist Anthony Trollope. He made the illustrations for Frances Trollope's 1840 book A Summer in Brittany, The Broad Arrow by Olin√© Keese (1859) and others. He was married in London in 1844. In 1858 Hervieu exhibited at the Royal Academy.

Previously, it had served on anti-aircraft (AA) duties during The Blitz. Origin ::See main article 36th (Middlesex) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers 344th Battery began as a part-time AA searchlight (SL) unit of the Territorial Army (TA). In 1924, the Royal Engineers (RE) formed a number of independent AASL companies of the TA in the Home Counties round London. One of these was 317th (Middlesex) Independent AASL Company based at Harrow. With the expansion of the TA's AA defences in the 1930s, this company was expanded into a full battalion (36th (Middlesex) AA Battalion) in 1936. While the battalion was based at Edgware, Middlesex, one of the new companies was 344th AA Company, which remained at Harrow. Major Edward Boggis, MBE, was transferred from 26th (London) Air Defence Brigade Signals, Royal Corps of Signals, to be Officer Commanding 344th AA Company.Monthly Army List. After the Munich Crisis in 1938, the TA was doubled in size, and 344th AA Company was detached from 36th AA Bn to provide the cadre for a duplicate unit, 58th (Middlesex) AA Battalion, RE. The new battalion had its headquarters at Harrow and was commanded by Brevet Lt-Col Boggis. Mobilisation ::See main article 58th (Middlesex) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery In view of the worsening international situation, a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in June 1939 with a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of World War II, Anti-Aircraft Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. 58th AA Battalion formed part of 40th Anti-Aircraft Brigade in 2nd AA Division. Based at RAF Duxford, the brigade was responsible for providing AA defence for RAF airfields in Eastern England.Routledge Table LX, p. 378.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files 344th AA Company was stationed at Spalding, Lincolnshire, moving to Alford, Lincolnshire in April 1940.344 S/L Bty War Diary, 1939‚Äì41, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 166/3187. The Blitz On 1 August 1940 the RE AA Battalions were transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA) and were redesignated searchlight regiments, the companies becoming batteries.Farndale, Annex M, p. 340.Litchfield, p. 178. By this time 58th S/L Regiment had been moved to 32nd (Midland) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, still in 2 AA Division, but now responsible for AA defence of the East Midlands during the forthcoming Blitz.2 AA Division at RA 39‚Äì45. Farndale, Annex D, p. 258.Routledge Table LXV, p. 396. 344 S/L Battery was based at Woodhouse Eaves in Leicestershire. There were heavy air raids on Leicester and Nottingham on the nights of 19/20 and 20/21 November 1940. During the latter raid one of the battery's lights was following an enemy aircraft when the aircraft dive-bombed and machine-gunned the site, causing casualties (one killed, one mortally wounded) and damaging the light before the detachment could respond with its defensive Light machine gun (LMG). One notable raid on Nottingham and Derby on the night of 8/9 May 1941 became known as the Nottingham Blitz. Later in 1941 the searchlight layout over the Midlands was reorganised, so that any hostile raid approaching the Gun Defended Areas (GDA) around the towns must cross more than one searchlight belt, and then within the GDAs the concentration of lights was increased.Routledge, p. 399. In March 1942 the Battery HQ moved from Woodhouse Eaves to the Militia Camp at Melton Mowbray.344 S/L Bty War Diary 1942, TNA file WO 166/7847. Mobile role On 19 April 1943, 344 S/L Bty received a warning order that it was to train for a mobile role. During May it drew motor transport and attended No 3 Battle Training School at Penybont in Radnorshire, then in June it carried out mobile training under 11 AA Bde at Wivenhoe Camp in Essex. Finally, in July, it moved to Grimsditch Camp, near Salisbury and joined 100 AA Bde, one of the formations preparing for Operation Overlord, the planned Allied invasion of Normandy. 344 was now an independent battery, no longer part of 58th S/L Regiment.344 S/L Bty War Diary 1943, TNA file WO 166/11549. By the end of 1943, Battery HQ was stationed at Oadby in Leicestershire and formed part of 74 AA Bde (another Overlord formation). On 1 January 1944, Major R.H. Taylor assumed command of the battery. In February and March it practised air cooperation at Cleethorpes on the Lincolnshire coast and at Easingwold in East Yorkshire, transferring to the command of 105 AA Bde. The battery was not scheduled to land in Normandy during the early stages of Overlord, so in April its personnel were deployed to Southampton to maintain security around the expeditionary force's marshalling area, while a rear party and the battery's Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) workshop remained at Corsham in Wiltshire to maintain and modify the equipment that it would take overseas.344 S/L Bty War Diary January‚ÄìMay 1944, TNA file WO 166/14901. North West Europe On 7 June, the day after D-Day, the battery was able to withdraw its security patrols and concentrate once more in order to waterproof its equipment for the voyage to Normandy. The battery moved to its marshalling area on 5 July, embarked on 7 July (less B Troop) and after a few days anchored off Southend-on-Sea, completing its disembarkation at the beachhead on 13 July. It immediately began 'movement light' training exercises with 15th (Scottish) Division (part of XII Corps) on the nights of 13/14 and 14/15 July.344 S/L Bty War Diary June‚ÄìDecember 1944, TNA file WO 171/1207. 90 cm Projector Anti-Aircraft, displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth Apart from AA defence, searchlights were used in the North West Europe campaign to reflect light off the cloudbase to provide 'artificial moonlight' or 'movement light' (also known as 'Monty's moonlight') in support of night operations. 344th and 356th Independent S/L Batteries pioneered this technique using their mobile 90 cm searchlights.Routledge, pp. 314, 317. It was first used to assist the assembly of troops for Operation Greenline on the night of 14/15 July, when the drivers of 15th (Scottish) Division 'found the light a great help to them in finding their way up the pot-holed track through the blinding dust'.Martin, pp. 66‚Äì9. The searchlight positions were subjected to light shelling and mortar fire and to low-level air attack, suffering three wounded. However, during the fighting the following night, a jammed column of troops and vehicles was dangerously silhouetted in the movement light, while elsewhere a smoke cloud blotted it out.Martin, p. 71‚Äì5. The battery continued to support British and Canadian formations as the Battle for Caen progressed, providing movement light for II Canadian Corps on 7/8 August. B Troop finally caught up with the battery in 9 August, having landed with the AA reinforcements under 107 AA Bde. After the breakout from Normandy, 344 Bty provided illumination for the engineers engaged in bridging operations at the River Seine on the night of 29/30 August, a section of A Troop with XXX Corps at Vernon, and B Troop with XII Corps at Louviers. In the subsequent pursuit over Northern France and Belgium, 344 Bty formed part of 106 AA Bde protecting XII Corps as it advanced from the River Somme to Antwerp, with individual Troops widely scattered supporting different formations. This caused practical problems for the BHQ and REME workshop in supplying carbon rods to individual detachments for the arc lamps and in servicing their searchlight control (SLC) radars.Routledge, Table L, p. 327. During Operation Market Garden, B Troop advanced with XXX Corps to Eindhoven and provided lighting for bridging operations on the Wilhelmina Canal at Son on the night of 22/23 September, while C Troop provided movement light along the vital traffic routes and A Troop later took up AA defence positions at Grave bridge. On 1 October, 344 Bty came under the command of 100 AA Bde in XXX Corps, and was deployed to defend the vital bridges at Nijmegen. These bridges were under regular attack from the air and from frogmen with explosive charges, so searchlights had to sweep the river as well as the sky.Routledge, p. 325, Table LII, p. 331. The battery (less B Troop, which was providing movement light for various formations' night moves and bridging operations) remained at Nijmegen until 11 November, when it handed over its commitments to 356 S/L Bty of 74 AA Bde, and moved up with 100 AA Bde to rejoin XII Corps. It provided movement light for operations by 51st (Highland) Division towards Weert and Roermond (14‚Äì21 November), during which it was sometimes subjected to shelling and bombing. At the end of November it moved from Weert to Helden, where it resumed an AA role, and then in December went into Corps reserve at Nederweert for rest and maintenance. On 22 December the battery relieved 356 Bty in the AA role at Geleen and round Maastricht, where there was increased enemy air activity over the Maas bridges in connection with the German Ardennes Offensive. 344th Moonlight Battery British triple 20mm Polsten gun AA mounting on the bank of the Rhine, 25 March 1945. The artificial moonlight technique was again used successfully in the Rhineland fighting in February 1945 (Operation Veritable),Routledge, p. 350.Martin, pp. 229, 236. and a number of searchlight batteries were formally renamed 'Moonlight' batteries, including 344, which split to create 344 and 581 Independent Moonlight Batteries, with some additional manpower coming from 1st S/L Regiment. In preparation for the assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder) the battery underwent intensive training in movement light and in using the 20 mm Polsten gun, which was replacing the LMGs issued to searchlight detachments for AA defence.Routledge, p. 353.344 M/L Bty War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/5095. As part of the deception plan for Operation Plunder the searchlight detachments exposed some of their lights every night for at least a week before D-Day to accustom the enemy to their use. 344 M/L Battery (including an attached Troop of 581 M/L Bty) was under the command of 100 AA Bde, supporting XII Corps, providing light for marshalling troops before the attack and during the assault itself on the night of 23/24 March. When all three banks of lights were exposed they drew enemy fire and air attacks, which destroyed one of 344 Bty's S/L generators and set fire to nearby ammunition. On XII Corps' front the assault was made by 15th (Scottish) Division, in the appropriately-named Operation Torchlight.Routledge, pp. 353‚Äì6, Table LVI, p. 365.Saunders, pp. 58, 143.Martin, p. 277. After the successful operation, the battery crossed the Rhine on 27 March, with A, B and C Troops assigned to 7th Armoured Division, 15th (Scottish) Division and 53rd (Welsh) Division respectively. 344 Bty continued to act as the moonlight battery for XII Corps for the rest of the campaign.Routledge, Table LVII, p. 366. 581st Moonlight Battery This battery formally came into existence on 21 February at Vilvoorde under the command of Maj R.V Spens (previously Battery Captain in 344 Bty).581 M/L Bty War Diary 1945, TNA file WO 171/5104. By 1 March its sections were deployed along the Maas, providing light for bridging operations and to assist patrols. During preparations for the Rhine Crossing, C Troop worked with the specialised armour of 79th Armoured Division at Nijmegen on trials of river crossing techniques, while A and B Troops were attached to 52nd (Lowland) and 3rd (British) Divisions respectively to provide movement light. A Troop then joined 344 Bty in the deception lighting before Operation Plunder and supplemented 344 Bty's lights during the battle. Once the river was crossed, 581 Bty helped to transport fuel to the front line, then sent A Troop to support 6th Airborne Division during its overland advance. In early April the battery was illuminating bridging on the Weser and then helping 15th (Scottish) Division in its advance, including defending divisional HQ against roving groups of German soldiers. On 23 April it began deception lighting at Artlenburg in preparation for the assault crossing of the River Elbe by 15th (Scottish) Division (Operation Enterprise).Routledge, p. 362. This took place on 29 April: :'The sky was densely overcast: so much so that the whole programme of air support for the next morning had been cancelled. Yet so bright was the Movement Light of the many searchlights that slanted their diffused beams into the clouds from positions in rear that onlookers could stand unseen in the shadows of Artlenburg with nothing but the waters of the Elbe, molten and gleaming, between them and the enemy'.Martin, p. 326. After the river had been bridged, A Troop provided lighting to prevent sabotage by frogmen, while the rest of the battery provided movement light for the convoys crossing over and advancing towards Hamburg. Postwar Searchlights set up to illuminate the Isenbruck Barracks near Hamburg, used to house German political prisoners after World War II In May 1945, after the German surrender at L√ºneburg Heath, 344 Bty was used to provide illumination over Hamburg, particularly the Prisoner of War (PoW) cages and the bridging operations on the Elbe. In July it was moved to Spandau, near Berlin, and then back to Brussels, on PoW escort duty. The order to disband the battery was received on 30 August 1945. 581 Bty's lights were used to control shipping on the Kiel Canal until it received its disbandment orders on 15 August.

Illustration by Robert Sedlacek (1881‚Äì1957) from Nesth√§kchen's Backfischzeit (1919). A Backfisch (\\"teenage girl\\", literally \\"fish for frying\\") is a young girl between fourteen and seventeen years of age. This volume deals with Annemarie's youth during the period of economic and political turbulence following World War I, 1919‚Äì1922. Annemarie is almost 16 when the story begins, after the Armistice, November 1918-19. Ury skips over 1920‚Äì1921. The last chapter, \\"Examination Grades,\\" concerns her high school graduation in 1922. Annemarie and her friends, Vera, Marlene and Ilse, attend upper secondary school. When Annemarie feels wronged by their German teacher, she wants to set up a student council modeled on the Soviet Republic and argues with the director of the school. Her unruly behavior endangers her education, but she ultimately advances to her senior class. Her 16th birthday party is disturbed by a general power cut and the economic blockade, which completely shuts down the electricity and telephone network. Annemarie visits her relatives on Arnsdorf Farm in Silesia (in the post 1945 editions Lower Bavaria). On her hasty return journey due to the occupation of Upper Silesia by Polish troops during the Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and first Silesian Uprising, she gets stuck in the town of Sagan by a railway strike. (In the post 1945 editions Anne Marie has to leave Arnsdorf because of an upcoming general strike, and her train is stalled for lack of coal in Nuremberg.) To earn money, she becomes a nanny for a doctor's family named Lange. The Langes soon realize that Annemarie is an educated girl from a good background, as she knows Latin, does not want to go on the street without a hat, is familiar with famous paintings and has a book by Selma Lagerl√∂f in her luggage. When Annemarie's identity is revealed, Dr. Lange turns out to be one of her father's Heidelberg University classmates, and the Langes treat her like a foster daughter until she leaves to return to Berlin. In winter 1919, there is a coal shortage and a violent wave of influenza. Annemarie tries to obtain coal for her family, but does not succeed. Finally, she gets sick. The novel ends with Annemarie's high school graduation. She and her friend Marlene have passed all written tests with A's and are exempted from the final oral examination. Despite the hard times, Else Ury's sense of humor permeates the narrative. Critical Reception \\"In the course of her various adventures‚Äîwith the Langes, in town, with a tyrannical teacher at school‚ÄîAnnemarie displays the winning blend of headstrong emotions, fiery temper, playful disposition, and precocious love of literature that made her such a favorite with German readers in the early years of the 20th century. That combination surfaces especially in this volume when Annemarie organizes a student council to redress perceived wrongs‚Äîwith her in charge, of course. This book was originally published in 1919, when German morale was shattered and the nation‚Äôs economy in tatters. The story clearly pitches Annemarie‚Äôs ebullience as an antidote to those ills, a psychological dynamism captured without fuss or archness by Lehrer. He smoothly handles the novel‚Äôs many social and literary allusions; his annotations remain unobtrusively helpful; and his translation of the text itself effectively conveys Ury‚Äôs affectionate, often tongue-in-cheek estimations of her own famous main character. The tale‚Äôs simple, hearty optimism reverberates not only in Lehrer‚Äôs translation, but also in the half-dozen charming period illustrations he reproduces. A heartwarming, old-fashioned Young Adult classic, set in the early 20th century, that also serves as a snapshot of a Germany in turmoil.\\" Kirkus Reviews Kirkus Review of Nesth√§kchen's Teenage Years Genre Else Ury, 1915 The Nesth√§kchen books represent a German literary genre, the Backfischroman, a girls' novel that describes maturation and was intended for readers 12 ‚Äì 16 years old. A Backfisch (\\"teenage girl\\", literally \\"fish for frying\\") is a young girl between fourteen and seventeen years of age. The Backfischroman was in fashion between 1850 and 1950. It dealt overwhelmingly with stereotypes, traditional social images of growing girls absorbing societal norms. The stories ended in marriage, with the heroine becoming a Hausfrau. Among the most successful Backfischroman authors, beside Else Ury, were Magda Trott, Emmy von Rhoden with her Der Trotzkopf and Henny Koch. Ury intended to end the Nesth√§kchen series with volume 6, Nesth√§kchen Flies From the Nest, describing Nesth√§kchen's marriage. Meidingers Jugendschriften Verlag, her Berlin publisher, was inundated with a flood of letters from Ury's young fans, begging for more Nesth√§kchen stories. After some hesitation, Ury wrote four more Nesth√§kchen volumes, and included comments about her initial doubts in an epilogue to volume 7, Nesth√§kchen and Her Chicks. Author Else Ury (November 1, 1877 in Berlin ‚Äì January 13, 1943 in the Auschwitz concentration camp) was a German writer and children's book author. Her best-known character is the blonde doctor's daughter Annemarie Braun, whose life from childhood to old age is told in the ten volumes of the highly successful Nesth√§kchen series. The books, the six-part TV series Nesth√§kchen (1983), based on the first three volumes, as well as the new DVD edition (2005) caught the attention of millions of readers and viewers.Patricia M.

Like the HL-20 (\\"Horizontal Lander 20\\"), the HL-42 would have been launched into low earth orbit mounted on top of a two-stage expendable rocket. At the end of the mission it would have re- entered and glided to a runway landing. The HL-42 was suggested as one possible successor to the Space Shuttle in the NASA Access to Space Study of 1994. In the end another alternative, a Single-stage-to-orbit design, was chosen for further development, and work on the HL-42 was abandoned. Background: NASA launch policy In the early 1980s it had been NASA policy to promote the use of the Space Shuttle for almost all launches, both civilian and military; only then, with Shuttle missions taking off almost every week, would the Space Shuttle program make economic sense. However, the Challenger disaster in 1986 forced a reconsideration, and in the following years many studies attempted to chart a way forward without reaching any consensus except for a growing feeling that \\"faster, better, cheaper\\" would be a good idea. There was also disagreement over the design (and indeed purpose) of the proposed Space Station Freedom. The Access to Space Study of 1994 Finally, as President Clinton took office for the first time in January 1993, the new NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin commissioned a major study that would reduce the multitude of possibilities to three well-defined options for launch systems. In November 1993, while that study was still under way, an agreement was reached with Russia to develop the Freedom design into the International Space Station, so for Space Station operations the study authors were told to design for the 'worst case': Assume a 4-person Station like Freedom that would have been built and maintained solely by the US, but put it in a Mir orbit with an inclination of 51.6 degrees (a significant change, as this would be more difficult to reach from Cape Canaveral and would reduce the Shuttle's payload by one third). On the other hand, the new era of cooperation with Russia would make it easier to buy and use the promising Russian first-stage engines of the RD-170 / RD-180 family, and the innovative tri-propellant RD-701. The NASA Office of Space Systems Development published this Access to Space Study in January 1994; it had a major influence on space policy for the rest of the decade. The study aimed for the chosen new launch hardware to be introduced starting from 2005 as the current Shuttles approached retirement, and to remain in use until 2030. Three expert teams each mapped out a possible path ahead: =Option 1: Continue to be Shuttle-based until 2030, but with upgrades= Option 1 was the most conservative, consisting of incremental upgrades to the existing Shuttle fleet and the possible construction of several more Shuttles using lighter, stronger materials. Vastly improved avionics could make uncrewed, autonomous operations practical and even desirable for some missions. =Option 2: Conservative engineering, expendable launchers, and some new vehicles including the HL-42= Option 2, slightly more adventurous and focused on economy and efficiency, would involve new vehicles but only small advances on existing materials and methods; Team 2 planned to use only technology expected to be readily available in 1997, and to have the new hardware ready for service in 2005. In the recommended version of Option 2 all launch vehicles would be expendable. Delta II would be retained; Atlas II would be upgraded with a Russian RD-180 engine; and the heavy Titan IV and Shuttle would be replaced by a new heavy launcher (using RD-180 engines and a J-2S-powered upper stage) which would support all Space Station operations using either a disposable uncrewed Automated Transfer Vehicle (for cargo) or the HL-42 re-usable spaceplane (for crew). =Option 3: Go straight for Single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)= Option 3 was ambitious, but Team 3 felt the time had come for a new generation of large, fully re-usable single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) launchers. They had been impressed by the April 1993 roll-out of the McDonnell Douglas DC-X and its central philosophy of drastically simplified \\"airline-like operations\\". Indeed, they concluded their part of the study with this italicized credo: The bottom line is this: operability must not be simply a goal; it must be THE design driver. Team 3 investigated several air-breathing, horizontal take-off alternatives building on the experience of the Rockwell X-30 (NASP) project, but concluded that the future lay with an all-rocket, vertical take-off, horizontal-landing SSTO design. Their reference design used the proposed but as yet unbuilt Russian RD-704 tri-propellant engines, small wings, and a cylindrical fuselage with a central Shuttle-style payload bay. This could carry either cargo or passengers, but in both cases operation would be fully automated. The team calculated that the first operational vehicle could be delivered in 2007, with a fleet of four ready to take over all Delta, Atlas and Shuttle operations by 2011. This final reference design strongly resembled the X-2000 Advanced Technology Demonstrator proposed in August 1993 by a group at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. =Final recommendation: Develop technology for SSTO= After analysis, the study decided on Option 3: \\"Adopt the development of an advanced technology, fully reusable single-stage-to-orbit rocket vehicle as an Agency goal.\\" \\"It has the greatest potential for reducing annual operations costs as well as life-cycle costs ... it would place the U.S. in an extremely advantageous position with respect to international competition, and would leapfrog the U.S. into a next-generation launch capability.\\" As for commercial satellite launches, it was felt that even Option 2 would have difficulty competing against Ariane 4 and Ariane 5, identified as being \\"the most efficient of the foreign systems\\". \\"Option 3, on the other hand, would lower launch costs so dramatically that U.S. industry could underprice all competitors. The U.S. would likely capture, and once again dominate, the international satellite launch market for a considerable period of time, utilizing these unique advanced technology vehicles.\\" Option 3 was recognised as presenting \\"moderate to high technical risk\\", but this \\"was felt to be manageable due to the 4 to 5 year technology maturation phase which would develop and demonstrate the needed technologies to at least a level 6 technology readiness level (proven in their operating environment).\\" =Outcome: Failure of hopes for SSTO= Once the decision had been made to concentrate on SSTO, NASA lost interest in the HL-42, and indeed in the whole concept of launching a crewed spaceplane on top of an expendable launcher. The last HL-20 studies based at NASA's Langley Research Center had been done in 1991, and they were not continued. NASA now took over the DC-X from the Pentagon and renamed it the DC-XA Clipper Graham. Two new projects were also started as technology demonstrators: the Orbital Sciences X-34 and the Lockheed Martin X-33. Once the technology had been proved, the next step would have been VentureStar, a commercial SSTO spaceplane. However, the \\"4 to 5 year technology maturation phase\\" did not go well. The DC-XA was cancelled in 1996 after the prototype was badly damaged in a landing accident, and the X-34 and X-33 were both cancelled in 2001 after disagreements and technical difficulties. Work on VentureStar also ceased in 2001, effectively ending the push towards SSTO. The HL-42 in Option 2=Option 2D launch system in detail= Team 2 arrived at their conclusions after an exhaustive examination of many possibilities, starting with 84 vehicle families, narrowing this to 28, then to four, of which three included the HL-42 crewed spaceplane. Their final detailed recommendation (Option 2D in the Study) was as follows: *For 5 tonne to low Earth orbit (LEO) missions, continue to use the Delta II (considered reliable and good value for money). *For 10 tonne to LEO missions, replace the Atlas II with a new launcher using one \\"low-cost, low-risk\\" Russian RD-180 engine on the first stage, and a newly developed Centaur upper stage with a single RL10 engine instead of two. *For heavier Titan IV or Shuttle-class payloads, retire the expensive Titans; and develop a new two- stage expendable heavy launcher, with three Russian RD-180 engines in the first stage, and a single J-2S in the second (which would in effect be an upgraded S-IVB stage). This new launcher would be able to lift about 38 tonnes to LEO without an upper (third) stage. The heavy launcher could then carry: * the new 23-tonne single-engine Centaur upper stage plus a geostationary satellite or an interplanetary spacecraft; * 8 tonnes of disposable adapter and escape-system plus the 21-tonne fully loaded HL-42 to LEO; * the disposable 7-tonne ESA-built ATV plus up to 30 tonnes of cargo or structure to the Space Station in LEO. ATV partner of HL-42 At this stage the ATV would have been a short, squat orbital tug with no storage space of its own, similar to the Service Module section of the later operational ESA Automated Transfer Vehicle. This tug could propel: * a Pressurized Logistics Module (PLM) with a large CBM-sized docking port; * an Unpressurized Logistics Carrier (ULC) with fuel and gas tanks; * complete new modules and truss structures for the Space Station itself. The teams had been told to assume that maintaining a 4-person Freedom-class Station would need 70 tonnes of up-going cargo each year. In Option 2, most of this would be carried in five ATV missions (three PLM and two ULC). Waste for disposal would be loaded into the ATV/PLM or ATV/ULC, which would then de-orbit and burn up on re-entry. The ATV could also de-orbit whole damaged or obsolete Space Station modules or structures if necessary. The launch system as a whole aimed for economy and efficiency, with common components (the RD-180 engines, the Centaur upper stage) being used as far as possible. The ATV would have been provided at European expense, in exchange for some use of the Space Station; in this cost-effective way ESA could preserve a foothold in space after the cancellation of the Columbus program in 1991. Even the ATV launch fairing was borrowed from the Titan IV. Six new vehicles or \\"program elements\\" would be required: Figure 24 from the Access to Space Study Summary Report It is notable that many of the Option 2 recommendations were in fact put into practice in later years, despite this option not being selected. Three of the proposed new vehicles were built and widely used. =How big should the HL-42 be? The downmass problem= Team 2 gave a great deal of thought to the question of downmass, cargo that would have to be returned safely to Earth (mainly equipment and completed experiments). This presented no problem for Options 1 and 3; the Shuttle could easily carry downmass, for example in a Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) in its payload bay, and VentureStar would have a similar system. In Option 2D, however, all of the downmass would have to be carried in the HL-42, which would need to be larger than the HL-20 to give some cargo capacity as well as crew seats. But how much capacity (volume as well as mass) would be needed in practice? Since Freedom existed so far only on paper, it was hard to estimate this, because there was no practical experience. The Russian space stations had sent down hardly any return mass, since the disposable Progress cargo modules were designed to burn up on re-entry, and the cramped three-person Soyuz re-entry modules had little room to spare. But Freedom and the ISS program were much more ambitious, and envisaged returning large biological and especially industrial-processing user experiments on a regular basis. Many of these experiments would be fitted into a bulky ISS International Standard Payload Rack (ISPR), too big even to fit through a Progress or Soyuz probe- and-drogue docking port. To load even one ISPR, the HL-42 would need a docking port of the same size as the 1300 mm (51-inch) Common Berthing Mechanism ports that would eventually interconnect the US-made modules of the Station. And how many ISPRs would it need to accommodate on each flight? Initially the teams were given a baseline figure of 58 tonnes of downmass per year (compared with the 70 tonnes of upmass), and this would have posed a major problem for Option 2: \\"However, the central issue relative to access to space is the return mass.\\" With hindsight, 58 tonnes seems unnecessarily large, and indeed immediate analysis by Langley Research Center (LaRC) showed that it could be reduced to 30 tonnes \\"by judicious return of spares, user, and crew systems.\\" This was still inconveniently large for Option 2, so LaRC went to work again, and determined that by giving priority to the user experiments, and throwing away almost everything else that was no longer of use, the annual downmass could be reduced to 10 tonnes, or roughly 15% of the upmass. This is the figure that was used to calculate the required size of the HL-42. Given three crew-rotation missions per year, each one would have to carry between three and four tonnes of down cargo. Team 2 calculated that this could be done by scaling up the HL-20 design by a factor of 1.42, coincidentally giving it a length of 42 feet (and the name HL-42). The combined mass of crew and cargo was set at 4.2 tonnes. The baseline annual up cargo manifest would then look like this: Figure 19 from the Access to Space Study Summary Report On the downward journey this manifest would return 78 mid-deck lockers, all extravehicular activity suits, and approximately 65 percent of the user pressurized racks (ISPRs). According to Fig. 19, the HL-42 would carry one or two ISPRs on routine upward flights; but diagrams of its internal arrangement show stowage for three. The system was designed to be flexible. If experience revealed a need for extra downmass at some times, extra HL-42 flights could be scheduled, or the sequence could be changed. Since all three vehicles used the same new heavy launcher this would cause minimum disruption to launch processing. Team 2 were very much aware that their minimal downmass provision might attract criticism: \\"The acceptability of this level of return (approximately 15 percent of delivered mass) represents an issue that should be addressed in the final Space Station Freedom logistics scenario.\\" However, later ISS experience suggested that this would not have been a problem. The HL-42 had about the same cargo capacity as the later uncrewed SpaceX Dragon, and for at least five years after the retirement of the Shuttle in July 2011 the Dragon was the only craft capable of carrying significant downmass from the ISS. The actual downmass figures for its first four Commercial Resupply Services missions CRS-1 to CRS-4 were 0.9 tonnes, 1.4 tonnes, 1.6 tonnes, and 1.5 tonnes, over the three years from 2012 to 2014. This suggests that the HL-42 would indeed have had sufficient capacity, especially with three flights a year. It would also have given the down-cargo a gentler ride than the Dragon (1.5g deceleration compared to 3.5g for the Dragon) and a much more convenient landing on a runway (rather than the Pacific Ocean splashdown of the Dragon). =Safety advantages of the HL-42= Since the Challenger disaster in 1986 it had been recognised that the Shuttle was not safe enough. The Study estimated its current \\"crew survivability\\" at 0.98. One of the aims of the Study was to increase this to 0.999. However, despite examining many possible Shuttle upgrades extending as far as 2030, Team 1 could not find a practical way of providing crew escape. The only effective way of making the whole system significantly safer would have been to upgrade the Shuttle's avionics and enable autonomous operation, to avoid risking lives on missions that were essentially just cargo delivery: \\"Providing additional crew escape capability was not recommended due to cost, weight, and center of gravity impacts, and technical risks. Several means to reduce costs further and increase flight safety were identified. One is an uncrewed orbiter, which would allow the flight rate to increase without impacting human safety ...\\". However, even if half the missions had been uncrewed, this would only have halved the risk and increased \\"survivability\\" to 0.99, still an order of magnitude worse than the target of 0.999. The general principle of improving safety by separating crew and cargo (not risking lives on cargo missions) had already been studied by NASA for several years before the study, and Option 2 was designed this way from the start. The HL-42 would only be flown when crew rotation was necessary. This also meant that the cargo-only hardware (ATV, PLM, ULC) did not need to be human-rated, making the whole system cheaper. Being much smaller than the Shuttle, the HL-42 could be mounted on top of its launcher, so on the pad and for the first minute of flight a simple launch escape system (LES) could \\"provide a high-thrust impulse to rapidly distance the HL-42 from a catastrophic booster event\\" and allow it to glide back to a runway near the launch-pad. To deal with a \\"catastrophic event\\" in the next few minutes of flight, there would be an option to fit the launch adapter (between the rear of the HL-42 and the top of the launcher second stage) with larger solid rocket motors, to provide a boost-back and a Return To Launch Site (RTLS) intact abort. If the accident happened beyond RTLS range, the LES would push the HL-42 clear and be jettisoned, and the HL-42 itself would glide back into the lower atmosphere. If no suitable long runways (possibly even at large commercial airports) were within reach, it would deploy parachutes and splash- down in the ocean. Since all the manoeuvring engines in the HL-42 itself used non-toxic methane fuel and liquid oxygen (rather than the toxic hypergolic fuels of the Shuttle) there would be no need for a runway \\"safing\\" procedure after any of these emergency landings, and less danger in a crash-landing. The HL-42 would have survived the circumstances that destroyed the Shuttles Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003. In 1986 the LES would have pulled it clear of the booster explosion; and on top of its launcher it would have been safely out of the way of the falling debris that fatally damaged the thermal insulation on Columbia. These considerations led the study to conclude that Team 2 had met the safety target with the HL-42: \\"The improvement of crew safety (probability of crew survival) to at least 0.999 from the 0.98 of the Space Shuttle was met or exceeded by the new vehicles of Options 2 and 3.\\" Design The HL-42 drew indirectly on three decades of experience with lifting body spaceplanes, but depended mainly on its immediate predecessor, the HL-20. Team 2 described the background of their design as follows: \\"The HL-42 design stems directly from the HL-20 lifting body vehicle concept under study since 1983 at Langley Research Center. It is a 42 percent dimensional scale-up of the HL-20, and retains key design and operational features of the HL-20 design. The applicable HL-20 design data base includes extensive NASA aerodynamic, flight simulation and abort, and human-factors research, as well as results of contracted studies with Rockwell, Lockheed, and Boeing in defining efficient manufacturing and operations design.\\" Figure 21 from the Access to Space Study Summary Report =Structure and thermal protection= Option 2 was based on technology available for practical use in 1997, so the HL-42 used many of the same materials as the Shuttle; it had a structural skeleton of aluminium alloy, and a very similar thermal protection system. The structural core of the HL-42 was the cylindrical aluminium pressure-cabin, with two access hatches: a large one at the rear for docking with the Space Station after the launch adapter had been jettisoned (and for pre-launch horizontal cargo-loading), and a much smaller hatch on the roof of the cabin for crew access while vertical on the launch pad (and as an alternative exit after landing, especially after parachuting to an emergency ocean splash- down). Aluminium frames extended from either side of this strong cylindrical core to support the rest of the structure. The whole lower surface of the lifting-body was protected from the heat of re-entry by Toughened Unipiece Fibrous Insulation (TUFI) tiles, a tougher, more impact-resistant version of the Shuttle's HRSI tiles; the upgraded TUFI tiles came into use in 1996. These tiles, matt black like those on the Shuttle, were bonded directly to a multi- piece titanium heat-resistant skin mounted on the aluminium frames. The upper surface skin, exposed to much lower temperatures, was made of aluminium honeycomb panels that could be removed to allow access to the unpressurised equipment bays between the frames. The upper skin was covered with the same insulating white fabric (AFRSI, Nomex Advanced Felt Reusable Surface Insulation) as the upper surfaces of the Shuttle. The fins were made entirely of titanium, with both TUFI tiles (in hotter areas) and AFRSI fabric (in cooler areas) directly bonded to the skin . The hottest areas of all, the nose-cap and the leading edges of the fins, were made of reinforced carbon‚Äìcarbon, as they were on the Shuttle. =Propulsion: OMS and RCS with methane fuel= The on-orbit propulsion systems of the HL-42 looked superficially like those of the Shuttle, on a smaller scale. At the rear, one on each side of the access hatch, were two Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines, used to adjust the orbit, rendezvous with other spacecraft, and finally de-orbit. The fully fuelled OMS was capable of giving the HL-42 a total velocity change (delta-v) of 290 m/s, similar to the 300 m/s figure for the Shuttle. The reaction control system (RCS) was also similar in principle to that of the Shuttle, a system of small rocket engines to control the attitude of the HL-42 in pitch, roll and yaw, using the same fuel as the OMS. This meant that in case of an OMS engine failure the remaining fuel could be sent through an interconnect to the rear-facing RCS engines to complete an emergency de-orbit burn. However, there was one major difference between the Shuttle and the HL-42: the type of fuel. The Shuttle used the toxic and hypergolic monomethylhydrazine (MMH) and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) for both OMS and RCS. In keeping with the new \\"faster, better, cheaper\\" airline-style operations principle, Team 2 decided to switch to methane (CH4) and liquid oxygen for both OMS and RCS. Although these are non-toxic and much easier to handle, it was a step into the unknown, as in 1994 hardly any work had yet been done on methane-lox engines. This was therefore listed as the fourth of the five Advanced Development Tasks Required for Option 2. =Aerodynamic control surfaces= Like the HL-20, the HL-42 had seven movable control surfaces: an elevon on each side fin, an all-moving central rudder between the fins, and four body flaps (two on the lower surface at the rear, and two on the upper surface between the rudder and the fins). Compared to the Shuttle, the HL-42 relied far more on the two lower body flaps for pitch and roll control, particularly in the middle stages of re-entry with high dynamic pressures and a high angle of attack. In this respect the HL-20 and the HL-42 were halfway between the Shuttle and vehicles like the later ESA IXV which had two lower body flaps and no other control surfaces. In the earliest stages of re-entry the HL-42, like the Shuttle, would rely entirely on the RCS for attitude control. In the case of the Shuttle, as the surrounding air grew denser and dynamic pressures increased, the ailerons on the outer trailing edges of the wings would grip the airflow first and take over roll control from the RCS. Then, a little later, the elevons on the inner trailing edges would take over pitch control. (The Shuttle's single rear body flap was less important for attitude control, acting only as a pitch trim tab and to shield the main engine nozzles from the heat of re-entry.) In the case of the HL-42, the elevons on the side fins were too close to the body to meet a steady airflow at this stage, so the two lower body flaps would take over instead, moving together to control pitch and differentially for roll. However, both for the Shuttle and for the HL-42, yaw would be controlled only by the RCS until much later in the descent, since the high angle of attack would still shield the rudder from the airflow. Finally, for both the Shuttle and the HL-42, as the airspeed dropped below Mach 3.5 with denser air and a lower angle of attack, the rudder would begin to meet the airflow and take over yaw control from the RCS. From here until landing the HL-42 would behave more like a normal aircraft, controlled mainly by elevons and rudder, with some roll control from the lower body flaps. At lower speeds the upper body flaps, moving together, could also assist the elevons in controlling pitch (at higher speeds they would be out of the airflow and ineffective). After touchdown the upper body flaps would be extended together with the lower body flaps to serve as air-brakes. =Internal power: electro-mechanical, not hydraulic= All seven HL-42 control surfaces were moved by electro-mechanical actuators, not hydraulics as on the Shuttle. The wheels (a conventional Shuttle-type tricycle undercarriage) were also lowered electro-mechanically, not hydraulically as on the Shuttle. This was the result of a deliberate shift in design policy: Langley Research Center had decided not to have any hydraulic systems on the HL-20, but to use electro-mechanical actuators instead, and the HL-42 followed the same principle. The Shuttle had been designed with three independent hydraulic systems, each pressurised by a turbopump driven by an APU powered by toxic hydrazine. These systems were only powered up during launch, re-entry and landing, and were designed to supply a lot of power for a short time. They could also cope with spikes in demand for up to three times normal power, lasting one or two seconds (for example, when rapidly moving all the control surfaces while also lowering the wheels). However, in the following decades some spacecraft engineers had come to regard hydraulic power as unnecessarily complex, unreliable, and hard to maintain. Even Team 1 in their list of possible Shuttle upgrades had recommended replacing some or all of the hydraulic systems with electro-mechanical ones. One of their reasons was to simplify ground processing by removing the toxic hydrazine APU fuel, and this fitted in well with the new airline-style operations policy. However, the HL-42 electrical system would now have to cope with large and unpredictable surges in power demand during landing. It was therefore designed with two power sources. Normal baseline power was supplied by hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells as on the orbiting Shuttle; but the HL-42 also had rechargeable silver- zinc batteries to provide reserve power for short periods of very high demand. (This was the same combination of power sources used on the Apollo CSM.) Team 2 recognised that some further development would have to be done on this two- source electrical system, particularly the procedures for switching reserve power in and out. They therefore made this the second of the five Advanced Development Tasks Required: \\"... actuators and their electrical power driving and switching systems must be matured, with emphasis on the power supply systems.\\" =Avionics= Electronic hardware had advanced tremendously in the two decades since the Shuttle had first been planned, and the HL-42 was designed to make maximum use of these advances. It would be able to check itself out on the launch-pad, and then fly an entire mission autonomously, navigating by GPS and continuously monitoring its own health. \\"Significant portions of mission operations will be accomplished through the use of automatic systems. Launch, ascent, on-orbit operations, entry, and landing are automated and require no crew intervention, thus reducing cost by eliminating major requirements for facilities and crew training. ... Ground management of on-board systems will be reduced by automation and on-board vehicle health management. Trajectory and navigation management are decreased by using the Global Positioning Satellite system.\\" Autonomous operation was a major departure from the philosophy of Apollo and the Shuttle, which had been designed as piloted vehicles. Flight control, guidance and navigation had already been automated in other aircraft, but \\"on-board vehicle health management\\" would be more of a challenge; practical spaceflight experience had shown that a major part of the pilot's job was to decide which alarms or combinations of alarms could be safely or temporarily ignored, and which demanded urgent action in view of the overall situation. These decisions would now have to be written into the software. Testing and debugging this software would be a challenging task given that opportunities for actual flight-testing would be extremely limited (to hours or, for launch and re-entry, even minutes per year). Avionics hardware obsolescence would bring other problems. While it might seem logical to upgrade the electronics every five to ten years, all of the software would then have to be re-validated on the new faster hardware, causing operational delays and expense that might well outweigh the benefits of better hardware. Team 2 were well aware of all this, and chose avionics and software as the first of the five Advanced Development Tasks Required: \\"avionics systems that can be upgraded, software that is automatically generated and validated, and the health management of in-flight functions.\\" Development: Business-as-usual versus Skunk Works In the early 1990s a feeling began to develop among some engineers that NASA's culture had become too bureaucratic, with too much paperwork and too many middle managers, and that better results might come from a slimmed-down \\"Skunk Works\\" approach. Two of the Study teams shared this feeling: \\"The Options 2 and 3 teams recommended a streamlined management and contracting approach patterned after the Lockheed \\"Skunk Works,\\" which features smaller, but dedicated and collocated government oversight, a more efficient contractor internal organization, rapid prototyping, and team continuity from design to flight.\\" Other NASA teams also shared the feeling. When the DC-X Evaluation Team briefed Dan Goldin on the DC-X project on 1 March 1994, only weeks after the study Summary was published, they recommended the same approach for further DC-X development. The DC-X had been built by McDonnell Douglas, so \\"rapid management\\" was by no means confined to Lockheed. Team 2 in particular hoped for major cost savings from this approach. \\"The development of the HL-42 ... could use a \\"Skunk Works\\" type approach. This approach has been used successfully in major military programs such as the Hercules, U-2, and SR-71. In a study conducted on the HL-20 payload system by the Langley Research Center and Lockheed, it was determined that significant savings could be achieved using this approach. Based on those results, the new approach for the HL-42 ... could yield reductions as high as 40-45 percent in the total spacecraft development and production cost estimates, compared to the traditional \\"business-as-usual\\" estimates. Team 2 characterised \\"Skunk Works\\" development as including: \\"firm requirements, single management authority, small technical staff, customers on site, contractor inspections, limited outside access, timely funding, reports only important work, simple drawing release, rapid prototyping, etc.\\" Routine operations In routine operations the HL-42 would be delivered to one of the three OPFs at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) to be prepared and loaded. It would arrive in flight-ready condition; all test and checkout procedures that would duplicate those already performed at the manufacturing facility would be eliminated. Once loaded, it would move to the VAB to be rotated to the vertical and mated with the second stage at the top of the heavy launcher. After this it would check itself out using its autonomous systems \\"with minimum personnel time and in one to two shifts\\". The whole stack would then be moved to one of the two Launch Complex 39 pads as with the Shuttle. Exactly the same procedure would be used for cargo launches using the ATV. For Shuttle ground operations the ratio of support staff to those who actually worked on the vehicle (the \\"nontouch-to-touch\\" ratio) was six-to-one. For the HL-42, Team 2 hoped to reduce this to three-to-one, a ratio more typical of commercial airlines, thus halving not just salaries but also accommodation costs. KSC would handle all the launches, handing over to a small (10-12 consoles) mission control room at Johnson Space Center in Houston as soon as the HL-42 had separated from the launcher second stage. \\"Autonomous systems that had targeted the booster to the separation point would transfer control to the orbital vehicle's autonomous system. This system would calculate the orbital insertion and steer the vehicle to that position. The vehicle would than proceed to the next pre-defined phase of the mission. This sequence would continue until all the mission events had been completed. Ground monitors will have the capability to terminate any phase and re-initialize the autonomous flight system with new instructions.\\" Since the 'crew' would now be just passengers, training could be greatly simplified and entirely simulation- based. \\"All training would be conducted in the central simulation facility. Training facilities should mirror flight control facilities for flight monitoring. The training facilities would be used to verify pre-flight analyses. The primary mode of training would be computer based. No motion based, fixed based, or flight aircraft facilities will be required.\\" All these detailed plans, however, were shelved when the SSTO option was chosen in 1994.  Legacy = Situation in 2001-2004: Option 2 partially adopted = By 2001 it had become evident that the SSTO Option 3 would be too difficult in practice (at least given the funding that Congress was willing to allocate) and the X-33, X-34 and VentureStar were cancelled in that year. Option 1, substantially upgrading the Shuttle system, had also been abandoned. The Study had shown convincingly that this could not be made cost-effective: \\"... it is clear that the major cost savings targeted as a goal for this study only accrue in architectures employing new vehicles.\\" It had also proved impracticable to raise Shuttle \\"crew survivability\\" above the current 0.98 or 0.99: Option 1 \\"did not improve significantly on the current crew safety analysis.\\" The existing orbiters would therefore not be substantially upgraded, and by 2004 it had been decided that \\"With its job done, the Space Shuttle will be phased out when assembly of the ISS is complete, planned for the end of the decade.\\" In practice, then, it was only Option 2 that was ultimately followed up, though not completely. Delta II was retained. Atlas II was upgraded with a Russian RD-180 engine and flew as the Atlas III in 2000. The expensive Titan IV would be retired in 2005 and replaced by a new heavy launcher introduced in 2004, although this new launcher would be the Delta IV Heavy (26 tonnes to Mir orbit), not the more powerful triple RD-180 version (38 tonnes to Mir orbit) proposed for the Option 2 system. With these upgrades the Atlas and Delta families would continue to launch American uncrewed spacecraft for some time to come; and the ESA ATV (launched on the European Ariane 5) would be ready to take over supplying cargo to the International Space Station three years before the Shuttle was retired. None of these vehicles, however, would be capable of ferrying crew to and from the ISS. = Crewed spaceplanes not reconsidered = Even though the problem of assuring post-Shuttle crew access to the ISS was now becoming more urgent, NASA did not revisit the Option 2 combination of a crewed spaceplane with an expendable launcher. The proposed X-38 Space Station 'lifeboat', while looking superficially similar to the HL-20, would have been ferried up as cargo in the Shuttle's payload bay, and used once or not at all; even this was cancelled in 2002. On the other hand, the military Boeing X-37, while operational from 2010, was much smaller (5 tonnes at launch), uncrewed, and never intended to support Space Station operations. NASA was able to reject all three of the options for post-Shuttle ISS crew access presented in the Study because a fourth option had recently become available: using the Russian Soyuz program infrastructure for all crew transport, a possibility that had not been considered in the Study. = The fourth option: Soyuz-Progress = In 1993, while the Access to Space Study was being created, several developments occurred in quick succession that would lead to greatly increased Russian cooperation with NASA. As a result, the status of Russian cooperation was still uncertain while the Study was being written between January 1993 and January 1994. The terms of reference allowed the authors to use Russian companies as equipment suppliers (notably for engines); but they were to plan for a 'worst case', and not rely on the newly established Russian Federal Space Agency for finance or services. Crew access was therefore assumed in the Study to be provided only by the US, Europe, Canada and Japan, the original Space Station Freedom consortium as it was in January 1993 when the Study was commissioned. Initially Soyuz-Progress was not considered reliable: \\"From the beginning, challenges arose with Russia‚Äôs participation. Many promises were made by high ranking Russian government officials .... Most were not kept. ... Russia‚Äôs ability to provide sufficient Soyuz 'lifeboat' spacecraft and Progress 'reboost' spacecraft also was questioned. Funding for Russia‚Äôs space program was under severe stress ...\\" However, over the next few years American confidence in Soyuz-Progress steadily grew. Russia managed to keep Mir in service and the ambitious Shuttle‚ÄìMir Program (1994-98) was a success. By July 2000 the first three ISS modules (two of them, Zarya and Zvezda, built by Russia) were in service, and after Mir was de-orbited on 23 March 2001 all the resources of the Soyuz-Progress system were available to support ISS operations. Relying exclusively on Soyuz-Progress for ISS crew access no longer seemed too risky. By the time the X-33 SSTO program was cancelled in March 2001, NASA no longer felt under pressure to develop an all-American crew transport vehicle quickly, just to assure access to the ISS after Shuttle retirement; the Russian Soyuz could now provide that, in the short term at least. As for the long term, NASA was working on a new initiative focused on reusable vehicles. = The Space Launch Initiative of 2001 = In February 2001 the Space Launch Initiative (SLI, also known as the 2nd Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) program) was formally established, with the goal of drastically reducing the cost of access to space. This would require ground-breaking new technology, and commercialisation and competition in the launch business. \\"Today, transferring NASA's space transportation needs to commercial launch vehicles remains the key goal of NASA's space transportation efforts.\\" The SLI was much less structured than the Access to Space Study with its three clearly defined alternatives. The SLI would start with \\"Hundreds of concepts\\"; then \\"In the program's first two years, a range of risk reduction activities and milestone reviews will gradually narrow viable reusable space transportation systems to two or three candidates.\\" Hopes were high: \\"With new technologies and operations ... the cost of delivering a payload will drop dramatically from today's price of $10,000 per pound.\\" It was however clear to everyone that re-usability could only be achieved after several technical breakthroughs; and it would be up to NASA to provide those breakthroughs, at government expense. Nobody had presented this position more clearly than Ivan Bekey, the much-respected former NASA director, in his influential Congressional testimony of 11 April 2000, which helped to decide the fate of the X-33. This attitude might be summarised as 'Cutting-edge, or not at all'. Bekey argued forcefully that since the whole purpose of the X-33 program was to develop and demonstrate new technologies, building it without the ground- breaking but difficult composite hydrogen tanks \\"makes little sense from a technical point of view.\\" = HL-20 and HL-42 revival impossible under SLI = These research priorities explain why the HL-20 and HL-42 programs were never revived by NASA. If even the SSTO X-33 (with its aerospike engine and innovative all-metal thermal protection system) was considered not cutting- edge enough without a composite tank, the HL-20 and HL-42 stood even less chance of being built with government money: * With their expendable launchers they were very far from bringing the desired tenfold reduction in launch costs; * They had been deliberately designed not to use any breakthrough technology; * Their job was already being done by Soyuz. In these circumstances there was no chance that they would be developed further by NASA. However, commercial space transportation companies would be quite free to develop the HL-20 and HL-42 designs if they wished; NASA now welcomed commercial participation. But companies doing so would risk facing competition from SLI itself. If NASA-funded research really did produce breakthrough technology with $1000 per pound launch costs (a tenfold reduction) then spaceplanes with expendable launchers could never be competitive. = SLI discontinued in 2004 = By 2004 it had become evident that NASA would never be given sufficient funds for the type of high-risk, high-return program advocated by Bekey: \\"well-funded parallel component developments\\", so that if some lines of advance failed, as they inevitably would, still one of them might succeed and bring immense rewards - perhaps even reducing costs to as little as $100 per pound. Not only was Congress reluctant to provide the funding, but the management of such programs had also proved to be unexpectedly challenging, as the X-33 and X-34 had demonstrated. NASA accordingly abandoned this line of development in March 2004. \\"NASA does not plan to pursue new Earth-to-orbit transportation capabilities, except where necessary to support unique exploration needs, such as those that could be met by a heavy lift vehicle. The budget discontinues the Space Launch Initiative ...\\" NASA's own new vehicle programs would now concentrate only on exploration beyond LEO: the Constellation program, and ultimately the heavy-lift Space Launch System and Orion (which would be designed primarily for travel beyond LEO, though if necessary it could also be used in a Soyuz role to support the ISS). = Post-2004 revival of spaceplanes: Dream Chaser = Now that there was no prospect of a dramatic NASA-funded breakthrough cutting launch costs by one (or even two) orders of magnitude, the way was open for commercial ventures to develop the more conventional ideas that NASA had dismissed for a decade as 'not cutting-edge enough', among them the HL-20 and HL-42. Now an idea that merely halved costs stood a good chance of being successful and even profitable. In 2006 Jim Benson (who had founded SpaceDev in 1997) licensed the HL-20 design for use in the Dream Chaser project. Unlike the HL-42, the Dream Chaser was not required to ferry three or four tonnes of cargo back down to Earth, so could return to the smaller size of the HL-20. This was light enough to be put on top of an Atlas-class launcher, and in 2007 an agreement was reached with United Launch Alliance to use the Atlas V as the first Dream Chaser launcher. This is the combination that finally, in January 2016, won a six-launch Commercial Resupply Services contract with NASA.

The film stars Edmund Lowe, Jean Dixon, Victor Varconi, Esther Ralston, Verna Hillie and Minor Watson. The film was released on April 22, 1935, by Universal Pictures. Plot Private detective T.N. Thompson, nicknamed \\"Dynamite\\" due to his initials, takes an interest when a man is murdered in San Francisco leaving a casino. The dead man, D.H. Matthews, had an argument outside the casino with Jarl Dvorjak, a celebrated pianist who was gambling while his aloof and money-mad wife Charmian was away. Dvorjak's acquaintance with Mona Lewis led him to the casino, which is owned by her father Clark Lewis and closed by the police after the killing. Mona becomes a suspect, particularly after Dvorjak's business manager Carey Williams is killed as well. When the pianist himself is shot while playing an organ, Thompson puts everything together and reveals to all that Matthews had actually been a son of Dvorjak's from a previous marriage who was conspiring with Charmian to gain his fortune.

Hammett's commission for that treatment was for \\"motion picture production...featuring the actor, William Powell.\\" Zanuck rejected the treatment, explaining that \\"The finished story [had] none of qualifications of Maltese Falcon, although the same character was in both stories.\\" Rights to the treatment reverted to Hammett, who reworked it, re-titling it On the Make and renaming the detective character Gene Richmond. After further re-work, and another change of the detective's name (to T. N. Thompson), the treatment was sold to Universal in 1935, with the script \\"liberally reworked\\" by Malloy and Clork.

It is one of twenty Yoga Upanishads in the four Vedas. The manuscripts of this Upanishad exist in two versions. The short version has 23 verses and is attached to the Atharvaveda, while the longer version has 106 verses and is attached to the Samaveda. The text is also called DhyƒÅna-bind≈´panishad. The Upanishad discusses meditation in Yoga. It states that silence during meditation is a reminder of the infinite subtlety therein. It asserts there is an Atman (soul) in every living being, and that a Yogi must seek to understand both the part as well as the whole of everything. The longer version includes techniques for six-staged Yoga. History The Dhyanabindu Upanishad is of ancient origins, states Mircea Eliade, who places its relative chronology to the same period when the following Hindu texts were composed ‚Äì Maitri Upanishad, the didactic parts of the Mahabharata, the chief Sannyasa Upanishads and along with other early Yoga Upanishads such as Brahmabindu, Brahmavidya, Tejobindu, Yogatattva, Nadabindu, Yogashikha, Kshurika and Amritabindu.Mircea Eliade (1970), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, , pages 128‚Äì129 The Dhyanabindu Upanishad and Yogatattva Upanishad include similar verses, in same sequence, but with some differences, which states Paul Deussen is likely because both these texts were derived from an older common source in India's Yoga tradition. Gavin Flood dates this text, along with other Yoga Upanishads, to be probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period. The longer version, found in South India, is probably one that was expanded, with additions to the text through the 2nd millennium CE because it shares verses with Gorakhnath's Vivekamartanda, Gitasara, Hatha Yoga Pradipika and other Hatha yoga texts. It is listed at number 39 in the serial order of the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads. In the collection of Hindu Upanishads under the title Oupanekhat, compiled by Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikhoh in 1656, consisting of a Persian translation of 50 Upanishads and who prefaced it as the best book on religion, the Dhyanabindu is listed at number 33 and is named Dehlan band. In the Colebrooke's version of 52 Upanishads, popular in north India, the Upanishad's text is at number 20. The Narayana anthology, popular in south India, also includes this Upanishad at number 20 in Bibliothica Indica. Contents The text is composed in poetic verse style, and uses metaphors. It opens by declaring Vishnu as a great Yogin. The Upanishad describes silence as \\"the highest place\\"; it states that there is a soul in every living being just like there is fragrance in flowers, oil in oil-seeds and butter in milk; and that a Yogi must seek to understand the tree branch and the tree, the part as well as the whole of everything. The Upanishad asserts that Om is a means to meditation, to understanding Atman and the Brahman (ultimate reality). The Om is the bow, the soul is the arrow, the Brahman the target of the arrow, asserts verse 19 of the text, metaphorically. Om should be meditated upon as eternal, infinite energy to see the God within, states the text, or for those addicted to God with form, Om should be meditated as Lord Shiva representing the light within the heart (Atman). The longer version of the Dhyanabindu manuscript that has survived into modern era, includes a six-staged Yoga method quite different than Patanjali's eight-staged practice described in the Yogasutras. The six fold yoga of Dhyanabindu includes Asana (posture), focus on breath and controlling its pace, withdrawing breath, steadiness of breath, Dhyana (meditation) and Dharana (concentration). The text mentions four chief postures for yoga ‚Äì Siddhasana, Bhadrasana, Simhasana and Padmasana. The right knower of Yoga, states the text, is aware of his or her body, the Linga and Yoni, adoring Kama. The longer version of Dhyanabindu includes a discussion of Kundalini yoga, asserting that the harmonious union of the masculine Shiva and feminine Shakti is one of the goals of Yoga. The text is notable for its references to and the fragments it poetically integrates from hymns of the Rigveda and other ancient Upanishads such as the Mundaka, Katha and Yogatattva Upanishads.

History In 1918, an 81.5 acre farm less than a mile south of Corydon was purchased by Arvel H. Miles. A sinkhole entrance to Binkley Cave opened on the farm at some point prior to a set of explorations in the 1930s. In 1944, the farm was purchased by Harvey Binkley, for whom the cave is now named. Most of the exploration of the cave has been done by the Indiana Speleological Survey. In 2010, Shane Myles and Tim Pride discovered an area now called Blowing Hole Boulevard. Blowing Hole Boulevard's west end is an eighty-five-foot tall room called Big Bone Mountain, named for several sets of animal bones found in the room. Subsequent excavations by the Indiana State Museum have determined the bones to originate from Pleistocene Ice Age animals. In 2012, the Indiana Speleological Survey began investigating a possible connection between Binkley Cave and nearby Blowing Hole Cave. A passageway thought to connect the two caves was partially blocked by breakdown rock, but dye testing and smoke bombs showed an air and water exchange between the two caves. Digging on both sides allowed cavers in both caves to shake hands through the rocks. This disproved the idea that the two caves were separate; they are now proved to be one cave. This connection made the Binkley Cave system thirty-five miles long - solidifying it, perhaps permanently, as the longest cave in Indiana. Development of Indiana Caverns began on June 1, 2012; the cave opened to the public on June 15, 2013. The Indiana Speleological Survey continues to explore Binkley Cave. Through the use of color dye in waterways, two local springs have been identified as the final destination of two yet unexplored cave passageways. Exploration of these waterways would add several miles to the cave's explored length. As of the end of 2015, the surveyed cave length was 42.57 miles with the potential for at least ten miles to be discovered in the distant future. =Geology= The Indiana Caverns portion of Binkley Cave is almost entirely located in St. Louis Limestone, which is a thinly bedded limestone of Mississippian origin. St. Louis Limestone includes beds of chert and shale (the chert is showcased on the tour). Brachiopods and coral are apparent in the rock on the show tour. Binkley Cave is a solutional cave formed from the dissolution of limestone by underground streams containing carbonic acid. The water takes the path of least resistance by running along the faults, fractures, and bedding planes of the limestone. The thinly bedded St. Louis limestone can be quite fissile, meaning it is weakest along straight planes. This weakness along the planes helped lead to breakdown events after the cave's initial formation, leaving behind flat surfaces on the ceilings and walls. Calcium bicarbonate is carried into the cave by drips of water. When the slightly pressurized calcium bicarbonate hits the air of the cave, the carbon dioxide is released, and the calcium carbonate precipitates out of the water. The calcium carbonate, in the form of the mineral calcite, a solid, crystallizes onto the bottoms and sides of existing stalactites, stalagmites, helictites, and sheets of flowstone to grow the formations over time. Other minerals are brought into the cave by flowing of water to create white, red, tan, and gray colors on the formations and walls. St. Louis Limestone is primarily made of calcite, but is also known to contain magnesium sulfate, manganese dioxide, ferric oxide, gypsum, dolomite, and aragonite. On the show tour, deposits of calcite, manganese dioxide, and ferric oxide are apparent. The top portion of the St. Louis Limestone layer through which the tour goes includes the Lost River Chert Bed, a layer of rock containing sheets of chert, a silicious rock, which is also apparent on the cave tour. Ice Age Because of the presence of Pleistocene fauna bones in the cave, it is believed that the top of the Big Bone Mountain room once featured a large natural opening that both opened and closed during the Pleistocene era. Carbon dating on three sets of bones in the cave indicate that the animals entered the cave circa 38,000 years BP, which would have been 17,000 years prior to the last glacial maximum. During the last glacial maximum, the glaciers of the Wisconsin glaciation extended past present-day Indianapolis. The earlier Illinoian glaciation extended glaciers all the way to the Ohio River, but stopped short of the Crawford Upland as the Mitchell Plain, in which Indiana Caverns sits. Almost all of Indiana's caves exist along a thin area between Bloomington and Harrison County, which was never glaciated. This information is based on private correspondence between Indiana Caverns and the Indiana State Museum. =Species= Flat-headed Peccary skull found in the cave. Two such skulls are shown on the tour. The species identified by the Indiana State Museum so far are: * Flat-headed Peccary, which is shown on the tour and are found in the cave in very large numbers. * The first known case of Northern Flying Squirrel in the state * Southern Flying Squirrel * Porcupine * Passenger Pigeon * Barred Owl * Vole * Garter Snake * Southern Red-backed Vole * Black Bear There are also bones of unknown species from a bird, a frog, a fish, and a shrew.

It was intended as a maritime reconnaissance and medium bomber aircraft but only two were built. Design Jean Latham's aircraft were built in a factory at Caudebec-en-Caux, initially by the Soci√©t√© Latham and two years later by Usines de Caudebec. The works were then purchased by the Soci√©t√© d'Emboutissage et de Construtions M√©chaniques (S.E.C.M.), part owned by F√©lix Amiot and a part of the Soci√©t√© Generale A√©ronautique (S.G.A.). One minor consequence of these changes of ownership was that the flying boat first known as the Latham 110 went under several other names, including Latham-S.E.C.M. 110, S.E.C.M. 110, S.E.C.M. (S.G.A.) 110 and Amiot S.E.C.M. 110-S. When Amiot's name was included an S was added to distinguish it from the unrelated Amiot 110 fighter. Design studies for the single-engine maritime reconnaissance flying boat were under way in the spring of 1930, including a decision to use a similar wing construction method to that of the S.E.C.M. 140. Particular attention was also paid to the hydrodynamics of the planing hull and to the riveting techniques required to make this all-metal aircraft watertight. The Amiot 110-S had a thick-section wing with a constant-chord centre section, occupying about one-third of the span, and tapered, blunt-tipped outer sections. They were mounted on the top of the fuselage with about 4¬∞ of dihedral. The wing structure was a development of the torsion-resistant box spars used in high-performance gliders, with three spars, built out of interconnected steel tubes, forming the central torsion boxes. The wings were duralumin-skinned, riveted to the substructure with separate enclosed leading edge sections which were bolted onto the central box, and the rear parts of the wing were similarly constructed. All sections were individually watertight with the leading edges housing the fuel tanks. The outer sections had high-aspect-ratio ailerons along their trailing edges. A Hispano-Suiza 12Nbr water-cooled, geared V-12 engine was mounted in a pusher position over the wing within a cowling which had an airfoil section in plan but which followed the contours of the cylinder heads. Radiators were positioned under the wings. Initially the engine was supported by N struts with additional lateral bracing struts. It was then redesigned as a single streamlined column. Early plans show a four-bladed propeller but a two-bladed one was fitted. The slender fuselage, which had a maximum width of only , was built around a strong longitudinal double beam which, together with other lighter longitudinal beams, located transverse frames with forked lower parts. The skin was riveted duralumin, like the wings. The 110-S's planing hull was a V with deeply concave sides, deepest at the nose then rapidly becoming more shallow rearwards approaching a small, single step. Stability on the water was provided by a pair of V-bottomed floats, strut-mounted from the outer central section. There was an open cockpit in the extreme nose for an observer, who was also responsible for navigation, radio communication and bomb dropping, fitted with a pair of machine guns on a flexible mount. bombs were held under the wing. There was a similarly armed cockpit just aft of the wing. The pilots' open cockpit was just ahead of the leading edge of the wing, with side-by-side seating and dual controls. At the rear the tail was conventional, with an almost triangular fin blending, at its top, into a vertical-edged balanced rudder which extended down to the keel. The tailplane was positioned well clear of the spray, over halfway up the fin and braced with struts from the lower fuselage. It carried separate, straight-edged, balanced elevators. Although the Amiot 110-S was primarily intended as a seaplane, it could be configured as an amphibian by the addition of a retractable wheeled undercarriage. Each single wheel was mounted on a V-strut from the fuselage side near the waterline. A vertical leg to the wheel hub was fitted with a shock absorber. On retraction the wheel was lifted into the wing underside. There was a leaf spring tailskid. Development The Amiot 110-S made its first flight on 12 December 1931 but was not mentioned in contemporary publications until shortly before it was displayed at the Paris Salon the following December. During August 1933 minor modifications were made to the hull to improve take-off performance and replacement of the Hispano-Suiza engine by a Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14K radial engine in a NACA cowling was considered. In 1935 a new engine was installed but this was a Hispano-Suiza 12Ydrs V-12 mounted in tractor configuration and driving a three-blade propeller. Despite the 32% increase in power, its maximum speed of was only 6% faster. Two Amiot 100-S were built, both of which were re-engined.

Men's Tournament New Mexico's Demetrius Walker drives against UConn's Enosch Wolf at the 2012 Paradise Jam Championship game The 2012 Paradise Jam featured some close games. ESPN predicted that UConn would face New Mexico in the finals, which did happen, but the results were far from ordained. In the first round, the largest victory was a seven-point win by New Mexico over the University of Illinois at Chicago. Connecticut beat Wake Forest by six, While George Mason, behind at the half, came back to win by three points over Mercer. However, the Quinnipiac ‚Äì Iona game was tied at the half, and tied at the end of regulation. Despite scoring 13 points in overtime, Iona fell to Quinnipiac. In the second round, the games were even closer. George Mason held a five-point lead over New Mexico with twelve seconds left, when the Lobos hit a three-pointer, then stole the ball and hit another three-pointer with under two seconds to play, to win by a single point. In the other match up, between two teams from the same state, UConn was down by double digits with five minutes to go, yet the game went to double-overtime before UConn won in the second overtime. In the title game, UConn came from nine points down to take a brief two-point lead with just over two minutes to go, but gave up nine straight points, and ended up with the loss 66‚Äì60. The Lobos hit all 21 of their free throw attempts in the game and went on to win the 2012 Paradise Jam Championship. =Bracket=Women's Tournament Geno Auriemma at 2012 Paradise Jam making a point The woman's tournament is organized as two divisions of four teams, each playing each other in a round-robin format. This format is chosen because the invitees occasionally include more than one team from a conference. Teams are not allowed to play each other from the same conference outside of scheduled conference play. A traditional playoff format, where winners player winners, and losers go into a losers bracket allows any two team an opportunity to play each other, This format is not suitable when there are multiple teams from the same conference. =Participating Teams= Island Division * Connecticut * Wake Forest * Marist * Purdue Reef Division: * DePaul * Florida Gulf Coast * Hampton * South Carolina =Overview= South Carolina's Ieasia Walker drives to the basket against DePaul's Brittany Hrynko, while Blue Demon coach Doug Bruno watches at the 2012 Paradise Jam TournamentThe first-round games were held on Thanksgiving Day 22 November, while the second- and third-round games were held on Friday and Saturday, the 23rd and 24th.

Dagmar Reichardt in 2007 during the ceremony of the 34. Flaiano International Prize for Italian Studies  Life  Dagmar Reichardt descends from a German Huguenot family with roots extending far back in time, the first documented Renaissance family crest of the Reichardt's being located in the cathedral St. Georg of N√∂rdlingen, Bavaria, showing the then-mayor of N√∂rdlingen Kilian Reichart (passed away in AD 1577) as first ancestor. The House's later branches include German composer and music critic Johann Friedrich Reichardt (1752‚Äì1814), as its most prominent cultural representative who appeared in K√∂nigsberg, Halle and at the courts of three Prussian kings in Berlin and Potsdam. With the Poet's Paradise Garden in Giebichenstein (Giebichensteiner Dichterparadies), which was also called Home of the Romantics (Herberge der Romantik) or Reichardt's Garden (Reichardts Garten) he created a meeting place for scientists and literary personalities of his time. He was close to the philosopher of German Enlightenment Immanuel Kant during his years of study in K√∂nigsberg, engaged in correspondence with his friend Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and set the latter's poems to music (Kunstlied), as he also did for Johann Gottfried Herder and August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben. Among other cultural activities, Johann Friedrich Reichardt went on several trips to Italy and published the Frankreich (France) journal in 1795, followed by the cultural-political journal Deutschland (Germany) in 1796. Reichardt's extended family includes not only the authors Ludwig Tieck, Heinrich von Kleist, a native of Frankfurt/Oder, and the historic Huguenot family De Pourtal√®s, but also the Silesian poet Hermann Isaac Emil von Petit (June 9, 1811 ‚Äì January 30, 1864; also called Hermann de Petit). Von Petit, who was the son of a lieutenant in the regiment of Malschitzky and a French Protestant refugee (R√©fugi√©), worked in the Silesian town of Brieg (now Brzeg, Poland) and was the author of the volume Poems: My Whole Wealth Is My Song (Gedichte. Mein ganzer Reichtum ist mein Lied, 1857) that is archived in the library of the Brieg museum. He also taught French, English, Italian, and Spanish, and published educational textbooks for these languages. Of these, especially his Practical Course for Learning the Italian Language (Praktischer Lehrgang zur Erlernung die italienischen Sprache, 1862 in its 3rd edition) and Indispensible Interpreter for Germans Who Travel to France, Especially Those Who Want to Visit the Paris Industrial Exhibition (Unentbehrlicher Dolmetscher f√ºr Deutsche, die nach Frankreich reisen, insbesondere f√ºr diejenigen, welche die Pariser Industrie-Ausstellung besuchen wollen), published on the occasion of the first major Paris Industrial Exhibition in 1855, have survived to this day. His volume of Festival Poems for Children (Festgedichte f√ºr Kinder, 1857) contained verses in German, French, English, Italian, and Spanish. In 1853, he published a weekly Brieg newspaper under the title of Jest and Seriousness (Scherz und Ernst), which contained essays, poems, and epigrams related to literature and history by various writers. Dagmar Reichardt grew up as the daughter of a German diplomat in Santiago de Chile and Rome/Italy before she started her international academic career in Germany. From 1986 to 1989, she co-founded, published, and edited the German-Italian culture magazine Zigzag: The Italian Magazine (Zigzag. Das Italien-Magazin) in cooperation with the Institute of Political Science at the University of Hamburg. In Hamburg, she also directed the creative writing workshop with the onomatopoetic German title Reiters Ruhm (Rider's Renown) by the Writers' Room e.V. from 1999 to 2009 and worked as a translator, book editor, ghostwriter, and freelance author. During this time, she edited literary books such as Neuere Deutsche Literatur (Newer German Literature, 1991; 1992), as well as an anthology by the Italian scholar of German literature Cesare Cases in German translation (1996). These were followed by additional literary translations (from Italian and English language into German) and critical editions, including the book of poetry Himmelsreden (Heavenly Speeches, 2004) by Giuseppe Bonaviri, the film script Der heilige Paulus (Saint Paul, 2007; with a foreword by Dacia Maraini) by Pier Paolo Pasolini, as well as music editions by Etta Scollo (2014) or Marco Basley (2014) and short texts by Ennio Morricone (2019), Igiaba Scego (2020), Iain Chambers (2020) and Dacia Maraini (2007 and 2020). Reichardt authored more than 200 publications, among them over 130 academic publications and, alone during the years 1987‚Äì2004, over 50 books of fiction and non- fiction on the German book market for which she was responsible, publishing and editing them as a freelance chief-lector, translator and ghostwriter. \\\\- For a complete list of publication view the personal website of Dagmar Reichardt.

The work received buoyant reviews in the international research scene and met with a very positive reception. Thus, the Sicilian journalist and writer Giuseppe Quatriglio considered this to be \\"a remarkable study [‚Ä¶] with undoubtedly meritorious and complex research results\\" (Giornale di Sicilia, April 7, 2006), while the Italian literature critic Sergio Sciacca honored it as \\"an exceptionally original work [‚Ä¶] and a significant step toward the cultural design of a \\"New Europe\\" (La Sicilia, July 21, 2006) and the German scholar Christoph Schamm certifies in the online-journal IASL i.a. the historical \\"outstanding significance that moving from the island to continental Italy\\" had to Sicilian travelers according to some statements in Reichardt's collection. The Spanish Italianist Paulino Matas Gil assessed the volume simply as \\"mandatory reading for international Italian studies\\" (Revista de la Sociedad Espa√±ola de Italianistas, 2005/3, p. 192).

It was long.  History = Opening = Ratgoed Quarry dates back to the 1830s. After a period of closure it re-opened in 1851. In 1859, the Corris Machynlleth & River Dovey Tramroad (later renamed the Corris Railway) opened between the village of Aberllefenni and the wharf at Derwenlas. This provided a cost- effective transport link for the slate quarries along the Dulas valley, but its northern terminus was more than a mile south of Ratgoed Quarry. In 1864, the Ratgoed Tramway was laid, connecting the quarry with the Corris Railway at Aberllefenni. The tramway was built by the owners of the Corris Railway, and was technically a branch of that railway, though throughout its history it operated as a separate entity. = Cymerau Quarry = Cymerau Quarry lies to the south of Ratgoed, and it was connected to the tramway from the start. The original workings were near the mill, adjacent to Cymerau Farm. Around 1880, a set of pits between Ratgoed Quarry and the original workings were opened, and the tramway was used to take uncut slate between these new workings and the mill, a distance of about half a mile. = Last years = The tramway passed into the ownership of the Great Western Railway (GWR) in late 1929, when the GWR acquired the Corris Railway. In 1948, the Corris was nationalised and became part of British Railways (BR), as did the Ratgoed Tramway. The Corris closed in August 1948, but the Ratgoed continued to operate, as an isolated section of horse-drawn narrow-gauge tramway operated by BR. = Closure = After the closure of the Corris Railway, the Ratgoed Tramway continued to provide the only transport link between the quarry and the transhipment point at Aberllefenni. It finally closed in 1952, with all the track lifted by the end of that year.  Route  The tramway trackbed on the far side of the valley bottom, heading north from Cymerau towards Ratgoed quarry The northern end of the tramway was just outside Ratgoed Hall an impressive building used by the quarry owners. The tramway ran almost due south, to a passing loop at the foot of the exit incline down from Ratgoed Quarry. The lower mill stood here, on the west side of the tramway. About a hundred yards south lay a small chapel and a row of cottages arranged at right-angles to the tramway. The cottage nearest the tramway had a bay window overlooking the track and served as the shop for the hamlet. To the south of the cottages was the quarry office. The tramway crossed a small stream which emptied into a large reservoir on the west side of the track. The line curved slightly to the west and entered the upper yard of Cymerau quarry. An incline on the east side of the tramway led up to the northern Cymerau workings, and there was a gunpowder magazine further south, also on the west side. The tramway continued south, past Ffynnon Badarn farm, the turning to run briefly south-west before resuming a southerly course and following the curves of Nant Ceiswyn. The tramway then came to the lower yard of Cymerau quarry. Tracks branched off to the east, with one entering a level, while another headed south to the main Cymerau mill. The tramway the crossed over the Ceiwyn on a fine stone bridge which still exists. It curved gently to the east in a cutting above the river and on the opposite bank to the main Cymerau mill and waste tips. Staying in the cutting, the line swung round to run eastwards above the river before negotiating a tight curve to run south, opposite Hen Factory and Pont Cymerau. Running due south again, the line passed through woods and came to Islwyn, another tiny hamlet. There was a congregational chapel - Capel Bethesda - here, a few houses and a school. There was a siding here to allow goods to be transferred from the tramway wagons for the use of the villagers. Curving back to run westwards again, the tramway passed behind the school, where there was a passing loop in the 1880s. The tramway is here on a small ledge just above the road from Llwydiarth to Aberllefenni and some distance above the Afon Dulas. The tramway threaded its way between the houses on the north-east corner of Aberllefenni village. At this point it was on a slate embankment above the Llwidyarth road. It then curved sharply to the south, crossing on a bridge over the road and tramway leading to Aberllefenni quarries. Continuing on a tall slate embankment, the line headed south past the Aberllefenni mill reservoir and quarry office, and passing behind the main terrace of cottages in the village. Dropping steeply, it ended just north of Aberllefenni station where it joined the formal terminus of the Corris Railway. A tramway from the Aberllefenni mill joined the Ratgoed here with a remarkable single-bladed point.  Operations  The tramway was laid in light, iron bridge rail, although a section between Aberllefenni and Islwyn was relaid in flat-bottomed rail in the 1920s, using rails recovered from a local timber tramway. Trains, often formed of a single waggon, were hauled up the line by horse. Loaded slate wagons would then return to Aberllefenni by gravity - the line was laid on a consistent falling gradient. As well as slate traffic from Ratgoed and Cymerau quarries, the line served the farms and houses along Cwm Ceiswyn, supplying coal and goods to them. Informal passenger services ran regularly on the tramway, with people riding in the open slate waggons. One waggon was even converted using wooden planks as seats. It was possibly the last horse tramway in Britain that carried passengers.

The two of them knocked out Ward Meachum where they have the bystanders tell Luke Cage that they have a score to settle when Ward Meachum regains consciousness. Luke Cage and Iron Fist tracked Shades and Comanche to the George Washington Bridge where they learned about their employer. Luke Cage and Iron Fist managed to defeat the two of them as the police arrive.

Shades was taken down by Cloak and Dagger.Marvel Knights #12 During the 2010 \\"Shadowland\\" storyline, Shades appears to have gone straight as he and Comanche have gone their separate ways. When in Hell's Kitchen, Shades became a community organizer. He worked with his son Victor where their relationship was strained upon Shades cheating on Reina. Upon Reina moving in with his brother Ignacio with Victor in his company, Shades remained in contact with them the best he could. When Bullseye had blown up a building during his fight with Daredevil on Norman Osborn's orders (as seen during the \\"Dark Reign\\" storyline), Shades was killed in the explosion while Victor survived upon absorbing the fragments of his father's visor. Upon Victor seeing the chi ghosts of the 107 victims of the explosion, Shades' chi ghost told him to open up and absorb more chi in the area which would give Victor enough power to fight back. Powers and abilities Shades is an expert at hand-to-hand combat. In other media=Television= Theo Rossi as Shades in the television series Luke Cage. Shades has appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe where he is depicted as bisexual.https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/luke-cage-season-2-shades-gay- bisexual-lgbtq/ * Shades is a supporting antagonist in Luke Cage, portrayed by Theo Rossi. Shades is introduced in season 1 of Luke Cage. His nickname comes from his signature pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses. A runaway as a child, Shades gets taken in by Cottonmouth and Mariah Dillard's grandmother Mamma Mabel, and spends his youth running with Cottonmouth's gang, going in and out of prison until he gets sent to Seagate with his best friend, Darius \\"Comanche\\" Jones. In Seagate, Shades and Comanche become enforcers to corrupt warden Albert Rackham. They are responsible for Luke gaining his powers, after they give him a severe beating for plotting to expose Rackham. In the first season, on his release from prison, Shades returns to New York City and becomes right-hand to Willis \\"Diamondback\\" Stryker, who later sends him to help out Cottonmouth and Mariah. After Cottonmouth is killed, Shades works with Mariah to frame Luke for the crime by paying Harlem's Paradise waitress Candace Miller to give false testimony to the police. At the same time, Diamondback shows up seeking revenge against Luke. As Diamondback's revenge campaign against Luke wears on, Shades becomes disillusioned with Diamondback, seeing his methods as detrimental to business, and he and Mariah turn against him after he kills a police officer and stages a hostage situation at Harlem's Paradise. Diamondback orders Zip to kill Shades, but Shades grabs a gun, kills both of Zip's accomplices, and then shoots Zip in the head after getting him to confess Diamondback's duplicity. After Luke successfully defeats Diamondback in a fight outside Pop's Barbershop, Shades doctors evidence to frame Diamondback for Cottonmouth's murder, and swipes Misty Knight's cell phone in order to lure Candace out of hiding so he can shoot her in the head. By the end of the first season, Shades has become Mariah's lover and helps her take over her cousin's enterprise, operating out of Harlem's Paradise. * Shades is referenced in The Defenders, set in between the first two seasons of Luke Cage. Turk mentions that he and Mariah have \\"ghosted\\" when Luke confronts him to ask him about a string of murders the Hand have been committing in Harlem, including Candace's brothers. * In season 2 of Luke Cage, Shades and Mariah are seeking to retire from the gun business by investing in insider trading. He also is reunited with Comanche, who has just been released from Seagate. Shades inadvertently screws up their attempts to sell the gun business to other criminals when he kills furniture magnate Arturo Rey for badmouthing Mariah to his face during negotiations. When sent to collect money from Nigel Garrison, who wants to buy their guns for the Brooklyn Yardies, he instead encounters Bushmaster, who gives him Nigel's severed head as a message. When Bushmaster announces his move into Harlem by beating up Luke on camera, Shades is the only one to take serious the threat Bushmaster poses to Mariah. In the course of helping Mariah deal with Bushmaster's attacks on her, and Misty's investigation of them both, Shades finds out that Comanche has been secretly passing information on to Captain Thomas Ridenhour. Comanche kills Ridenhour and tries to deflect suspicions to Sugar, but Shades reluctantly shoots him with Ridenhour's gun and makes it look like the two men performed a mutual kill. However, he is unable to let Comanche bleed to death, so Shades shoots him again to give him a swifter death. While Mariah is under Misty's watch, Shades finds out that Bushmaster frequents a restaurant owned by his aunt Ingrid and uncle Anansi, and kidnaps Anansi. He and Mariah then lead an attack on Gwen's to smoke Bushmaster out, but this leads to a falling out between them after Mariah needlessly guns down innocent civilians in the restaurant and burns Anansi alive. Shades turns himself in to Misty and confesses to every crime he's committed on behalf of the Stokes gang, and agrees, in exchange for immunity from prosecution, and to act as a mole to incriminate Mariah. They succeed and arrest her. Mariah orders a purge of her associates, including Shades, but he manages to overpower and kill the assassin sent for him. He later visits Mariah in jail to tell her that he's untouchable and express his disillusionment of her. After Mariah is poisoned in jail by Tilda, Shades is arrested by Misty for the murders of Candace and Comanche as his immunity deal that had him dependent on Mariah getting convicted has been voided by her death. He chuckles in defeat as Misty tells him that Mariah apparently had files released posthumously that mean he will also take the fall for all of her crimes.

When the two teams met in the Paradise Jam final, the game started out similarly to the early game, with Marquette never trailing, and reaching a nine-point lead at halftime. However, instead of scoring 59 points in the second half, they would score only 59 points in the game. The Golden Eagles, ranked 16th in the AP poll, held a 14-point lead at one time, but Norfolk State had two 7‚Äì0 runs and tied up the game at 57 points apiece with just over two minutes left.

It was initially known as the Museo del Folklore e dei Poeti Romaneschi (\\"museum of folklore and Roman dialect poets\\"). Following a period of closure it was reopened under its present name in 2000. In addition to a permanent collection related to the recent culture of Rome the museum also houses temporary exhibitions, including the annual World Press Photo exhibition. It is part of the Museo di Roma. Via Giulio Romano, painting by Ettore Roesler Franz History The material on exhibition includes the so-called ‚ÄúRoman Scenes‚Äù,http://www.romemuseumguide.com/museo-di-roma-trastevere/ life-size models which were previously exhibited in the Museo di Roma at Palazzo Braschi. There was limited space for them at that museum and it was also thought appropriate to transfer them to Trastevere, which is a part of Rome where popular Roman culture is considered to remain strong. Exhibits The museum's permanent exhibition focuses on Roman life in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Major themes are costume, folk dancing, festivals, and crafts. The collection includes paintings, prints, drawings and watercolours, including the series on Roma sparita (\\"vanished Rome\\") by Ettore Roesler Franz (1845‚Äì1907), and life-size representations of day-to-day life, known as \\"Roman Scenes\\". Exhibition of the Franz water colours is rotated in order to conserve them. Other painters represented include Samuel Prout, Bartolomeo Pinelli, Adriano Trojani, Guillaume Fr√©d√©ric Ronmy, and Arnoldo Corrodi. There is also a gallery of photographs. The ‚ÄúRoman Scenes‚Äù show a chemist‚Äôs, a room where a wine cart is stored, the courtyard of an inn where dancing is taking place, the inside of an inn, a square with a public scribe, and two pipers in front of a votive kiosk. A monument to Trilussa in Piazza Trilussa close to the museum The museum has some manuscripts of the Roman dialect poet Giuseppe Gioachino Belli, and also contains some of the personal possessions of another Italian dialect poet, Trilussa (1871‚Äì1950), which were donated to Rome after his death. The ‚ÄúTrilussa Room‚Äù consists of a video installation together with paintings and other items belonging to the poet. See also * List of museums in Rome References Category:Rome R.
