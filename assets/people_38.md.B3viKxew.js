Forsythe manned second base until Gyorko returned in mid-July, and then served the club in a utility role playing shortstop, second, and third as well as both corner outfield positions.

A contemporary story tells that James V gave him the battle standard and command at the Battle of Solway Moss. Another story tells how at the end of his life he shamed the haughty servant of Regent Morton by showing him how his own prosperity had faded. Life=At the royal court Oliver Sinclair was a brother of William Sinclair of Roslin. Like many minor aristocrats he had a role at the Royal court. Oliver and his wife Katherine Bellenden were involved in the administration of the King's purse with John Tennent of Listonsheils. Oliver had the keeping of the king's purse during his trip to France in 1537. He also bought some feathers for decorations at the King's entry to Paris and the tournaments following the wedding at Notre Dame. Sinclair also bought feathers in February 1541.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (Edinburgh, 1907), pp. 16, 22, 41, 429. With John Tennent, he supervised Mary of Guise's archery practice in the summer of 1542.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 8 (Edinburgh, 1908), p. 115. His official role at court was cupbearer, and he was given livery clothes at Christmas time to the value of ¬£20. This was the second tier; the clothes of the two Masters of the Household cost ¬£50, the laundress Maus Atkinson's (John Tennent's wife) livery was ¬£13-6s-8d, and the outfits of the men who turned the spit in kitchen cost 26 shillings and eightpence.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 125. When the King's mother Margaret Tudor was dying in October 1538, Oliver and John Tennent rode with the King to her at Methven Castle. She had died when they arrived, and Oliver and John were ordered to parcel up her belongings.State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 5 part 2 cont., (London, 1836), pp. 193-4, Ray to Privy Council. Solway Moss and after Oliver Sinclair was captured by the English at the Battle of Solway Moss in November 1542. Among a list of prisoners, Oliver, James Sinclair, and Alexander Sinclair were listed together as men of small value and substance. They were released with the Laird of Cleisburn's son kept as their hostage or 'pledge' in England.Edmund Lodge, Illustrations of British History, vol. 1 (London, 1838), p. 24. George Douglas of Pittendreich sent a report to Henry VIII of England stating that Sinclair was commander. However, reports by the English commanders fail to mention any commanding role. George Douglas was also the source of the story that James V died in a feverish delirium at Falkland Palace still lamenting the loss of his standard and the capture of his favourite Oliver at Solway. Whether or not Sinclair actually was commander at the defeat of the Scottish army, the immediate currency of the story shows that James V's employment of lesser nobles caused jealously amongst those who were excluded, especially the exiled Douglas Lords. Henry VIII obtained another story on 12 December 1542, before the death of James V and the birth of Mary, Queen of Scots were known, that James V had left his army in the west and gone to Tantallon Castle to meet a mistress that Oliver's wife kept there for him.Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol. 17 (London, 1900), no. 1194. Cleisburn's son was still a prisoner after the Battle of Pinkie, and was released in February 1548. The Privy Council ordered Thomas Wharton to free the \\"pledge\\" but asked him to protract the process, if possible, to increase Cleisburn's devotion to England. Oliver Sinclair himself was given a reward of ¬£50 from Edward VI of England on 17 February 1548 when the deal was concluded.John Roche Dasent, ed., Acts of the Privy Council, vol. 2 (HMSO, London, 890), pp. 171, 543. David Hume of Godscroft writing around 1600 gives the usual story of Oliver deserted by the nobility of Scotland at Solway (Solemne-Mosse), but adds an epilogue to his career. Regent Morton, in the 1570s, had a servant, George Auchinleck of Balmanno, who controlled access to his master and thereby justice. One day Sinclair came to Edinburgh Tollbooth and caught Auchinleck's attention, and when he came over and asked his business, all the old man said was, \\"I am Oliver Sinclair\\", then slipped away. Hume of Godscroft explains that Sinclair meant that Auchinleck would all too soon become insignificant, and the incident was much discussed at the time.Reid, David, ed., David Hume of Godscroft, History of the House of Angus, vol. 1 STS, (2005), 104, 231, Hume's anecdote relates to the motto 'Hodie mihi: Cras Tibi' Today it's me; tomorrow it will be you. Stories of Solway Moss George Douglas of Pittensreich's account of the events before Solway was that after James V had left the Scottish army, Oliver Sinclair was appointed commander instead of Lord Maxwell. Some Scots who would not accept Oliver's authority then refused to fight and the battle was lost. This account was accepted by subsequent sixteenth-century Scottish chronicle writers. However, writing about 80 years after, the author and poet William Drummond of Hawthornden collated an alternative version of events. Hawthornden attributed the defeat to a misunderstanding; Sinclair was tasked only to deliver the message that Maxwell was in command, and when he was raised up to speak, the anxious army thought he had been made leader. During their confusion the English attacked.Drummond of Hawthornden, William, History of Scotland: History of the five Jameses (London, 1655), pp. 226-7. Family Oliver married Katherine Bellenden.Accounts of the Lord Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (1907), 248.

Thornton's paper - titled \\"Radicalisation at Universities or radicalisation by Universities?: How a student's use of a library book became 'a major Islamist plot'\\" - was submitted for a conference on terrorism held by the British International Studies Association at the University of Manchester. It dealt with the case of Rizwaan Sabir who was arrested after being found in possession of several academic works available from the University library along with a digital copy of the Al-Qaeda Training Manual downloaded onto a University computer from a United States Department of Justice web site.Thornton, R. (2011) \\"Radicalisation at Universities or radicalisation by Universities?: How a student's use of a library book became 'a major Islamist plot'\\" Paper prepared for the Critical Studies on Terrorism on Teaching About Terrorism panel at the British International Studies Association Conference, University of Manchester, April 2011, p. 8 Among the assertions made in the paper is the allegation that Sabir was monitored by senior management and his marks lowered so he could not move on to a PhD. Numerous documents suggested to Thornton a systematic attempt to smear the character of Mr Yezza and Mr Sabir in order to justify the decision to call the police. Pages from the online encyclopedia Wikipedia concerning the case were also altered by individuals within the University.Thornton, R. (2011) \\"Radicalisation at Universities or radicalisation by Universities?: How a student's use of a library book became 'a major Islamist plot'\\" Paper prepared for the Critical Studies on Terrorism on Teaching About Terrorism panel at the British International Studies Association Conference, University of Manchester, April 2011, p. 75 The paper was removed from the BISA website, despite this the 112-page article is freely available to view online. Later BISA published an open letter expressing \\"a strong feeling of unease and concern\\" among members over the question of academic freedom raised by Thornton's case and called for an independent inquiry into the affair. In response to the controversy a spokesperson for the University stated that the paper contains \\"clearly defamatory\\" material about several members of University staff. Commenting on Thornton's case Cathy James, chief executive of the pro-whistleblowing charity Public Concern at Work, emphasized: \\"It's really important that whistleblowers are supported.\\" Despite this, senior management at the Nottingham University maintained the suspension of Thornton. On 15 June the pressure group SWAN (Support the Whistleblower at Nottingham) in association with Unileaks published all of the internal and government documents referred in Thornton's paper. An exclusive was given to The Observer which also asserted that students involved in activities related to the Palestine and the Middle East were being monitored and secretly filmed by the University. Thornton had claimed in his paper that Middle Eastern themed events and protests had been suffered discriminatory treatment despite their peaceful nature. A video subsequently emerged appearing to support this claim, and soon after another surfaced apparently showing security members destroying a Gaza memorial. Thornton's paper also accused the University of being anti-Palestinian, citing the attempt by senior management to host the Israeli Ambassador for a 'public' talk without informing the student population. Later a letter signed by 167 staff, students and alumni appeared in the Observer supporting the claims made by Thornton. They added: \\"The arrests of two university members, Hicham Yezza and Rizwaan Sabir, in 2008 were not isolated incidents but, in our view, indicate an institutional culture of intolerance within university senior management.\\" In May 2011, The Guardian newspaper published a letter of support signed by 67 academics from around the world, including Noam Chomsky. This letter called for Thornton's reinstatement and an independent inquiry into his treatment by Nottingham University. In March 2012 it was announced that Thornton was leaving his job as a lecturer at Nottingham, and that, \\"for his part, Dr Thornton accepts that the article which he published on the BISA website in April 2011 contained a number of inaccuracies.\\" Thornton apologized for any offence he might have caused. Subsequently, Rizwaan Sabir completed his PhD and now works as a lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University. In June 2014, at Sabir's request, the University of Nottingham held an inquiry into the marking of his MA dissertation which had led Thornton to write his BISA article. At this inquiry, where Thornton was present, it was found that the marking had, indeed, not followed procedures. Sabir was thus awarded the Merit mark for his MA in 2014 that he had not received in 2009.Packer, Kate. \\"Re: Academic Appeal Committee Hearing Outcome.\\" Letter to Dr. Rizwaan Sabir. 10 Aug. 2015.

He eventually landed a position as Creative Director for the Silverman Group.  Art and career  \\"High & Dry\\" for Night & Day Solo Show Toys Sket‚Äôs career moved forward with his inclusion in the first series of Dunny blind-boxed mini-figures in 2004, produced by at the time little known Kidrobot. Sket made and continues to make the most of the newfound exposure by designing figures for several designer vinyl companies including Kidrobot, Red Magic, Kaching Brands, Solid Industries, and 3D Retro. Collectors became familiar with Sket‚Äôs art through his toys. While Sket first made his name in designer toys with production figures such as his Dunny Designs. The Dunny shape, which is a curved toy bunny created by Tristan Eaton with a smooth face is designed to be repainted and reinterpreted by artists from many different backgrounds. Sket was featured in at least four series produced by Kidrobot. General toy production pieces were also created, including self-designed and limited release figures such as vegetable-based Eggster and Buckeye Rot and Stay Puft Marshmallow Man- esque Ripple and the Dripple. More corporate toys were also designed by Sket, including a figure for the 3‚Äù Trexi series promoting Coca-Cola in 2008. In 2012, he produced a custom shell for Boombotix, as part of their artist series. Sket began to start experimenting in the growing popularity of the custom toy culture. Customs are one-off hand-painted versions of existing toys.

It was founded immediately after Ottoman Empire captured Prizren from Serbian Despotate in 1455. The rest of the territory of Serbian Despotate was conquered after the fall of Smederevo in 1459, and divided into following sanjaks: Sanjak of Vuƒçitrn, Sanjak of Kru≈°evac and Sanjak of Smederevo. At the beginning of the First Balkan War in 1912, the territory of Sanjak of Prizren was occupied by the army of the Kingdom of Serbia. Based on Treaty of London signed on May 30, 1913, the territory of Sanjak of Prizren became part of Serbia.  Administrative divisions  According to the 1571 Ottoman register, the Sanjak of Prizren consisted of five nahiyahs: Prizren, Hoƒça, ≈Ωe≈æna, Trgovi≈°te and Bihor. In its final borders (between 1889 and 1913), the Sanjak of Prizren consisted of the kaza (districts) of Prizren, Tetovo and Gostivar. The territory that once belonged to the Sanjak of Prizren now belongs to Kosovo (Prizren region) and North Macedonia ( Tetovo and Gostivar regions.  Skopje, Prizren and Kosovo vilayets  In 1867, the Sanjak of Prizren merged with the Sanjak of Dibra and Sanjak of Skopje and became the Prizren Vilayet. In 1871 the Sanjak of Prizren became part of the newly established Prizren Vilayet. The Prizren Vilayet and its sanjaks, together with the Sanjak of Prizren, became part of the Kosovo Vilayet, which was established in 1877. Prizren was decided to be the seat of Kosovo vilayet. The Sanjak of Ni≈° and Sanjak of Pirot together with Vranje (which was kaza of the Sanjak of Pri≈°tina) were separated from Kosovo vilayet and joined to the Principality of Serbia after Berlin Congress in 1878. The Sanjak of Dibra was attached to the Monastir Vilayet. After those changes Kosovo Vilayet consisted of three sanjaks: the Sanjak of Prizren, Sanjak of Skopje and Sanjak of Novi Pazar. Despite the decisions of Berlin Congress to award control over the Sanjak of Novi Pazar to Austria-Hungary, it remained under de facto administration of the Ottoman Empire.  Young Turk Revolution  After the Young Turk Revolution, occurred in 1908, the Ottoman Empire organized the first parliamentary elections in the Sanjak of Prizren.  Disestablishment  Until the end of October 1912, during the First Balkan War, the Sanjak of Prizren was occupied by the Kingdom of Serbia.

Overview In contradistinction with electrophoresis, motion of particle in homogeneous electric field only, electrodiffusiophoresis occurs in the areas of the dispersion that experience concentration polarization due to, for instance, electrochemical reactions, see electrochemistry. There are concentration gradients in such areas that affect particles motion strongly. First of all they create inhomogeneity in the electric field. Secondly, they cause diffusiophoresis. This peculiarities of the particles motion in the areas subjected to the concentration polarization justifies introduction of the special term for this electrokinetic effect - electrodiffusiophoresis. One of the most important differences of the electrodiffusioporesis from the electrophoresis is that exists as directed particles drift in the alternating electric field. Electrophoresis, in contrary, causes only particles oscillation on the same spot. This difference opens opportunities for important applications. Electrodiffusiophoresis was theoretically predicted in 1980 - 82.Malkin, E.S., Dukhin, A.S., Kolloid Zh., vol.42, p.481 (1980).Malkin, E.S., Dukhin, A.S., Kolloid Zh., vol.44, p.254 (1982). It was experimentally observed microscopically in 1982.Ulberg, Z.R., Kuznetsova, E.S., Malkin, E.S., Dukhin, A.S., Kolloid Zh., vol.44, p.523 (1982). The first application of this effect was explanation of particles depositing at some distance from the surface of the ion selective membrane.Dukhin, A.S., Borkovskaya, Y.B. Ionoselective membranes, p.68 (1982). These earlier experiments and theory were described in the review published in 1990.Ulberg, Z.R., Dukhin, A.S., Progress in organic coatings, Elsevier, p.1-41(1990). This review presents also application of electrodiffusiophoresis for making bactericidal coatings. This effect has attracted new attention in 2010 with regard to microfluidics.Rica, R.A.; Bazant, M.Z.

A delegate at the 1914 congress of the Social Democratic Youth League, Olsson was thereafter one of the first Swedish communists to undergo political training in Soviet Russia. Communist labour leader Olsson served as party secretary of the Communist Party. He also presided over the Trade Union Committee of the party and was the trade union affairs editor of Folkets Dagblad Politiken. However, after the sixth Congress of the Communist International the party suffered a factional conflict.

Mellan tv√• internationaler - Socialistiska Partiet 1929-37 In August 1929, Olsson and Kilbom visited Moscow and were given the opportunity to express self-criticism. In October 1929 the split was final, as Kilbom, Olsson, Flyg and their followers were expelled from the party by the Executive Committee of the Communist International (through its representative Kullervo Manner). The expellees regrouped as a separate Communist Party of Sweden, later renamed Socialist Party. Olsson became the spokesperson on trade union affairs of the new party.

It was primarily proposed as a 2D model and lately was extended to 3D.M.Walter, A.Fournier, and D.Menevaux. 2001. Integrating shape and pattern in mammalian models. Proceedings of SIGGRAPH 2001 (August), 317-326. An important feature of the algorithm is that it is biologically plausible. Since the algorithm was created in order to address some of the problems with texture mapping, its main goal is to produce, with the same set of parameters, a variable number of color patterns for a 2D or 3D object model. This way, for a relatively big amount of different entities represented by the same model, instead of using the same texture (and, doing so, each object would be equal to the others), one could use the different color patterns created by the MClone algorithm. Another useful feature of MClone is that it can be used to create patterns along with growing data of the object model.  The algorithm  The MClone algorithm, essentially, works as follows: given the 3D model of the object which we want to create a new pattern, we first randomly place n cells on the model's surface. Each cell has a type, which defines many cell's properties, including its color. This way, for instance, if we want to simulate a pattern that has only two colors, we should use just two types of cells. Now that the model has the defined cells, and they are placed randomly, we want them to create a pattern. For this to happen, we make relaxations between all cells. We have two fundamental parameters in these relaxations: the mitosis rate of each cell type (which indicates the delay in days for the cell type multiplication) and the adhesion rate of each cell type to the others (and to itself too). This last one is a number smaller than 1 that subtracts from the resultant force of the relaxation (thus, keeping the cells together). Each relaxation happens has a defined \\"day\\" in which it occurs (this is the way MClone calls the relaxation process). The number of relaxations per day is defined at the beginning of the algorithm. The mitosis rate is defined as a number that indicates in how many days a cell is going to reproduce \\"again\\". For example, if the mitosis rate of a given cell type is 4, the cells of that cell type are going to reproduce themselves in average every 4 days (i.e., for a cell born in the first day, it reproduces itself in the fifth day, and in the ninth day, and so on). Passed a given number of days, we are going to have a well defined pattern, which can be, or not be what we were waiting for. Although it could not seen intuitive through the explanation above, an important feature of the algorithm is that it is easy to predict how it will become a pattern just after taking a look at the parameters passed to the algorithm.

Located at the border with Poland, it is best known as the site of the Medyka- Shehyni (border checkpoint).  History  The village, situated 14 km east of the city of Przemy≈õl was first mentioned in 1515 in a royal charter under the name of Szechinie. For most of its existence the village belonged to the Land of Przemy≈õl, itself part of Ruthenian Voivodeship of the Kingdom of Poland and then (since 1772) Austrian Galicia. From the very beginning the village belonged to the so-called key of estates including Medyka, Pozdziacz, Torki and Buc√≥w, centred on the manor in Medyka, all based on a local variant of Magdeburg law, dubbed Ruthenian law. Initially the peasants settled there were tasked with taking care of the royal stables in Medyka; with time their duty towards the owner of Medyka manor was modified to simple serfdom, with yearly rent paid in grain. The village had a voigt (a certain Konarski) as late as 1565, and was populated by no more than 7 families of peasants. By 1589 the village had 48 male inhabitants (eligible for levy) and two inns paying a yearly rent of 78 Polish guilders. Some time before that date a mill and a fish pond were constructed in the village. As part of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria in 1880 there were only a handful of houses along the road linking Przemy≈õl with Mo≈õciska (today Mostyska), with time the village grew to 1036 inhabitants (including 825 Ruthenians, 237 Poles and 63 Jews). Infrastructure Beside the border checkpoint, the village has train station Mostyska-Derzhkordon (literally meaning Mostyska-State Border). Through Shehyni also passes a road .

History = 1983‚Äì1989  DG3 traces its roots back to 1983, when Michael Cunningham formed Cunningham Graphics International Inc. (CGI) in the United States. CGI served the financial service industry as a print broker. In 1989, CGI established itself in the New York City area as a print manufacturer, specializing in printing time sensitive investment research for the financial service industry.  1990‚Äì1999  In 1990, CGI shifted its focus to the globalization of financial markets. As a result, CGI formed a strategic alliance with both Roda Print in London and Workable in Hong Kong. Roda Print was known for developing and producing fast turnaround printing services for the investment banking community in London. Workable was known as the printer of choice for Hong Kong's finance industry. The alliance between the three companies formed the World Research Link (WRL). WRL specialized in simultaneous printing and distribution across multiple time zone for CGI's global clients.Peterson's Guides, Peterson's. Peterson's Job Opportunities. Petersons, 1999. p. 343. Throughout the 1990s, CGI focused on acquiring the in-house print facilities of major financial institutions. In all, CGI acquired ten in-house production operations from the twenty top financial institutions in the world, while providing non-exclusive services to an additional three. In 1998, CGI completed its initial public offering on Nasdaq (NM: CGII) and acquired Roda Print and Workable Printing Limited in Hong Kong. In addition, CGI acquired several other printing firms and completed additional outsourcing transactions in the United States. In the first year of public offering, CGI saw a gain of 71% over the previous year's earnings.  2000‚Äì2006  In June 2000, CGI was acquired by the world's largest payroll processing and financial services back office processing firm ‚Äî Automatic Data Processing Inc. (NYSE: ADP). The business changed its name to ADP Graphic Communications and operated as part of ADP's Investor Communications Division. In 2004, Peter Furlonge acquired CGI Europe Limited, CGI Asia Limited, CGI Japan Limited and CGI Pacific Limited from ADP in a management buyout to form The CGI Group. Furlonge then completed the acquisition of a large digital print business called 3D Digital Ltd. and formed CGI Squared, a technology- focused creative communications business in Birmingham, England of which John White was Managing Director. In 2006, Peter Furlonge acquired the US graphic communications businesses from ADP, reforming the CGI business to look like the company prior to its acquisition by ADP. David Klaiss was promoted to President of the North American business and played a leading role in stabilizing the company and returning it to profit.  2007‚Äìpresent  In 2007, CGI changed its name to Diversified Global Graphics Group ‚Äî DG3, and award-winning entrepreneur Michael Cunningham returned as Group Chief Executive Officer.

History Sofology started out as CSL Sofas, and was originally an auction rooms based in Clayton-le-Moors, Accrington, Lancashire. In 1982, after including catalogue seconds lounge furniture, they moved into specialist sofa retail and manufacture. The company originally started as a high street store chain, selling only its own products. Around 2002, the company ceased sofa manufacture in the United Kingdom, citing that it could source products in Europe, Eastern Europe and the Far East at better value, as the reason. Sofology has an expanding list of stores on high profile retail parks in the United Kingdom. The business focuses on retailing leather sofas, fabric sofas, corner sofas and recliner sofas. In February 2016, Sofaworks re branded to Sofology, following the loss of a court case against a competitor who argued that the Sofaworks name infringed on one of its owned brands. Sofology has made significant investment in television advertising, with expansion into geographical television regions and a clear move towards music based commercials. In December 2010, it saw 260 complaints to the ASA. This was as a result of an advert created to remake \\"Girls on Film\\", by Duran Duran. This used scantily clad women around the sofas. However, the complaints were not upheld, and the advert was allowed to run despite its critics.http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2011/3/CSL/SHP_ADJ_145628.aspx In October 2017, DFS announced the purchase of Sofology in a ¬£25 million deal. The acquisition was ratified by the Competition and Markets Authority in November 2017. Operations Sofology employs around one thousand people across all of its locations, including its head office in Golborne. The company operates all its own deliveries and service technicians in house. A training centre is also located at head office. In 2011, the business had a fleet of over forty 7.5 tonne vehicles, as well as twenty professional technicians. The business has six distribution centres, covering all of its stores, Golborne being the largest at over , followed by one at in South Yorkshire, and one at in Seaham in the North East. A further warehouse was opened in 2011. The most recent warehouse was opened in Bathgate in 2014. In May 2011, Sofology, as CSL, joined The Furniture Ombudsman. The business was also runner up in the 2010 Manchester Evening News Business of the Year (lost to Pets at Home). However, in 2010, it came first in Business XL Fastest Growing Business. Firsts Sofology was the first sofa company in the United Kingdom, to allow Mary Portas, Queen of Shops into its business. The television episode showed the inner workings of Sofology (then known as CSL) for a documentary on Channel 4. In January 2011, as a result of the show, the business started to campaign for transparency of pricing and discount offers, offering to help change laws surrounding what qualifies as a genuine discount. A single price offer was put forward, with a commitment from the business to maintain the lowest price possible. The show was heavily reviewed and commentated on by publicists. Sofology was the first company of its type in the United Kingdom to offer a range of sofas for delivery within 72 hours. Sofology was also the first United Kingdom sofa retailer to make use of the Apple iPad as a point of sale device for taking orders in store, made possible by the development of a bespoke application. Sofology has also made headlines by featuring Owen Wilson in two marketing campaigns, which began in November 2017.

He is currently the NDP's Quebec lieutenant and Ethics critic. Boulerice was appointed as the Deputy Leader of the New Democratic Party on March 11, 2019 by party leader Jagmeet Singh. As of the 2019 federal election, Boulerice is the only NDP MP from Quebec. Early life and career Alexandre Boulerice was born June 18, 1973, in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. He started working at age 15 as a lifeguard for the municipality and then went on to become pool manager. After his c√©gep years, he studied sociology at the Universit√© de Montr√©al, and then earned his Masters in political science at McGill University. Subsequently, he worked as a TV journalist (LCN, TVA), while being involved in his local union as vice-president of CUPE 687. He has also worked for a community group, l'Union des travailleurs et travailleuses accident√©s de Montr√©al (UTTAM). He then became a communications consultant for the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE). Federal politics With Jack Layton during the 2011 federal campaign Alexandre Boulerice has been active in the New Democratic Party since the late 1990s. He first ran in the 2008 federal election and finished a distant third with 16.26 percent of the vote, well behind Bloc Qu√©b√©cois incumbent Bernard Bigras. He then became the Vice President of Communications for the Quebec section of the NDP, under the presidency of Fran√ßoise Boivin. In the May 2, 2011, federal election, the NDP received 30.6% of the votes, which translated into 103 seats in the House of Commons, of which more than half were from Quebec. This result allowed the NDP to form the Official Opposition in the House of Commons for the first time in history. This electoral breakthrough is now known as \\"la vague orange\\" (Orange Crush). One of those seats belonged to Boulerice, who won a decisive victory with 50.8% of the vote, finishing 9,700 votes ahead of Bigras.Election 2011: Rosemont‚ÄîLa Petite-Patrie. The Globe and Mail, May 2, 2011. The NDP had never finished higher than third in the riding or its predecessors before. On 26 May 2011, Boulerice was appointed as opposition critic for the Treasury Board of Canada. In April 2012, he was appointed as Labour critic, and then as deputy Ethics and Access to Information critic.Shadow Cabinet NDP website After the 2015 election, Boulerice was appointed the NDP's Quebec lieutenant, as well as its critic for Ethics and deputy critic for Democratic Reform in the 42nd Canadian Parliament. He also serves as one of two New Democrats on the Special Committee on Electoral Reform. Following the 2016 federal NDP Convention's non-confidence vote in Thomas Mulcair, various media outlets mentioned Alexandre Boulerice as a potential candidate, including The Globe and Mail, The Canadian Press, and columnists such as Lysiane Gagon. CBC TV quoted him a few days after the convention saying it was 'too early' to decide whether to run. In early 2017, Boulerice was named Finance critic for the NDP. He was re- elected in the 2019 federal election and was subsequently the only NDP MP returned from Quebec.  Bill C-307  In fall 2011, Boulerice tabled Bill C-307, a private member's bill \\"For the reassignment of pregnant and lactating women\\",Parliament of Canada website to protect the rights of pregnant and lactating women who must leave their jobs to protect their health or the health of their child. This bill was intended to allow all workers to receive a reassignment under the provisions in force in their respective provinces. Quebec workers covered by the Labour Code of Quebec can receive benefits from the Workplace Health and Safety (OSH) in the program, \\"For safe motherhood.\\" This bill was intended to allow workers covered by the Labour Code of Canada receive the same benefits and not be penalized during their pregnancy. This bill was rejected with 169 votes against and 108 votes in favour in May 2012.  Canada Post  In December 2013, Canada Post's board of directors announced that it would be gradually putting an end to door-to-door mail delivery, leading to the elimination of 6,000 to 8,000 jobs. Boulerice was one of the first to oppose the cuts by promptly launching a petition to inform citizens of the consequences of such a decision. Bolstered by broad public mobilization and mounting political reactions, he collaborated with the Canadian Union of Postal Workers to tour Quebec in order to explain the changes and to garner support against the decision. He ended his campaign by submitting a brief before the Commission sur le d√©veloppement social et la diversit√© of the City of Montreal, which studied the impacts of ending door- to-door mail delivery on the installation of community mailboxes in densely populated areas, and on the quality of life of seniors and disabled people. Vimy Ridge comments On April 10, 2007, Boulerice wrote on a Quebec left- wing politics blog, Presse-Toi A Gauche, praising those who objected to and actively resisted Canada's participation in the First World War stating it was \\"a purely capitalist war on the backs of the workers and peasants\\". Boulerice further criticised the Harper Conservative Government's celebration of the Battle of Vimy Ridge saying that \\"thousands of poor wretches were slaughtered to take possession of a hill.

The film covers the island's 1609 discovery by Henry Hudson, its 1870s incarnation as a respectable beach destination for city-dwellers and showcase of the new developments ushered in by the machine age, the early 20th century, when amusement parks and innovative attractions attracted hundreds of thousands of people each day, and the gradual demise of the amusements. The film is narrated by Philip Bosco. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and broadcast nationally on PBS as part of the American Experience program in February 1991. On-camera appearances include Al Lewis, Vincent Gardenia, Eli Wallach, Elliot Willensky, Frederick Fried and Mae Timpano. Voice-over actors include Judd Hirsch, Nathan Lane, John Mahoney, Jerry Orbach, George Plimpton, Lois Smith, Frances Sternhagen and Andrei Codrescu.Coney Island Internet Movie Database Synopsis Coney Island began as a resort destination in the early 1830s and gained popularity in the 1860s as advances in transportation reduced the time it took to get there from other parts of New York City. As visitors increased, attractions were added, including a tall observation tower, the Coney Island Elephant hotel, early roller coasters, carousels, and arc lights to enable nighttime swimming. Politician John Y. McKane controlled approval of much of the building for years until he was removed from office for election fraud. Just before 1900 CE, George C. Tilyou built Steeplechase Park, the first of the three major amusement parks of Coney Island. At this point, Coney Island was attracting around 250,000 people on a summer Sunday. Luna Park followed in 1903, debuting its popular \\"A Trip to the Moon\\" ride. The park was decorated with thousands of electric lights, which were still a novelty at the time. In January 1903 before Luna Park opened the owners decided to euthanize one of their elephants named Topsy by publicly electrocuting it. Conducted at the Shoot the Chute lagoon plastered with advertising banners announcing the new parks opening, the spectacle drew 1500 people, 100 press photographers, and an Edison Manufacturing film crew (scenes from the Edison film Electrocuting an Elephant can be seen in this segment). In 1904, Dreamland was opened by William H. Reynolds. It featured historical reenactments, a dwarf village with 300 residents, and an infant incubator for premature babies, designed to show off this latest scientific development. Just seven years later, a devastating fire destroyed Dreamland and initiated the slow decline of Coney Island. The death of George C. Tilyou in the aftermath of World War I saw a reduced level of innovation in the new attractions at Coney Island, though the crowds only got bigger. During the Great Depression, many of the existing attractions, amusements and midway prizes were reduced in scale to save money. As World War II ended, the new ubiquity of the personal automobile allowed families to easily vacation at less crowded beaches in the Greater New York area. In 1946, Luna Park closed. Steeplechase Park limped along until closing in 1964. Critical reception Time magazine called the film one of the top ten television programs of 1991,Best of 1991: Television and the Chicago Tribune called it \\"one of the best documentaries you will ever see\\".

Joseph Connell and Ralph Slatyer further developed the understanding of successional mechanisms in their 1977 paper and proposed that there were 3 main modes of successional development. These sequences could be understood in the context of the specific life-history theories of the individual species within an ecological community.  The 1977 study  Connell and Slatyer chose to focus on autogenic succession, which occurs on newly exposed landforms and is initiated by changes from within the community rather than a geophysical transformation.Connell & Slatyer They targeted plant and immobile aquatic organisms that demanded the greatest surface area within an environment and could modify the physical landscape. They defined community as \\"the set of organisms that occur together and that significantly affect each other's distribution and abundance\\".  The models  The key factor distinguishing the three models is how the process of succession affects the original, pioneer species (i.e. their relative success in later-successional stages).Connell & Slatyer, 1121-1124. Facilitation model Facilitation Model Based on the assumption that only particular species with qualities ideal for \\"early succession\\" can colonize the newly exposed landforms after an ecological disturbance. ::*These \\"colonizing\\" qualities include: highly effective methods of dispersal, the ability to remain dormant for long periods of time, and a rapid growth rate. However, the pioneer species are often subsequently less successful once an area has been heavily populated by surrounding species due to increased shade, litter or concentrated roots in the soil, etc. ::*Thus, the presence of early successional species often changes the environment so that the habitat is less hospitable for the original species‚Äô own ecological demands and facilitates the invasion of later-successional species. (Note: See Ecological Facilitation.) Tolerance model Tolerance Model In this case, new pioneer species neither inhibit nor facilitate the growth and success of other species. The sequences of succession are thus entirely dependent on life- history characteristics such as the specific amount of energy a species allocates to growth. ::*The climax community is composed of the most \\"tolerant\\" species that can co-exist with other species in a more densely populated area. Eventually, dominant species replace or reduce pioneer species abundance through competition. Inhibition model Inhibition Model Earlier successional species actually inhibit growth of later successional species and reduce growth of colonizing species already present. ::*Example: Pioneer species might modify the environment through rapid growth and make the area increasingly shady (essentially increasing competition for light). ::*The environment is thus less hospitable to other potential colonizing species. ::*The only possibility for new growth/colonization in this successional sequence arises when a disturbance leads to dominating species being destroyed, damaged, or removed. This frees up resources and allows for the invasion of other species that were not previously present.  Examples of each model  :1. Facilitation Model ::Essentially, the facilitation model suggests that the presence of an initial species aids and increases the probability of the growth of a second species.Ricklefs, 400. For example, in \\"Physiological Controls Over Seedling Growth in Primary Succession on an Alaskan Floodplain\\" by Lawrence R. Walker and F. Stuart Chapin, III, the presence of alder plants aids the growth of willow and poplar seedlings in an Alaskan floodplain.Walker & Chapin. ::Alder roots contain nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which greatly increase the amount of inorganic nitrogen present in soils.Walker & Chapin, 1518. This increased availability of nitrogen aids the growth of both willow and poplar seedlings in areas without other competition. Eventually, however, willow and poplar grow more rapidly than alder, leading to a reduction in the abundance of the pioneer species, and eventually, spruce becomes a later-succession species, due to its increased ability (over alder) to grow in shaded areas.Walker, et al. ::Another case of facilitation comes from the colonization of lakeshore sand dunes.Connell & Slatyer, 1124. Adjacent pioneer plants colonize the otherwise moving sands and alter the environmental constraints of the sandy environment to better suit other plant species, which can then allow for soil binding to take place.\\"Sand Dunes\\". The giant saguaro cactus, in this respect, can only survive in the shade of other plants (or in some cases rocks) ‚Äì pioneer species facilitate their existence by providing shade. (The argument has also been made that this type of interaction is exemplary of the tolerance model; see below). :2. Tolerance Model ::The tolerance model is completely dependent upon life history characteristics. Each species has an equally likely chance to establish itself in the early stages of succession and their establishment results in no environmental changes or impacts on other species.Moorcroft. Eventually, early species, typically dominated by r-selected species, which prioritize fast rates of reproduction, are out-competed by K-selected species (species that become more dominant when there is competition for limited resources). ::For example, we can examine succession in the Loess Plateau in China. In the graph on page 995 of the paper \\"Plant Traits and Soil Chemical Variables During a Secondary Vegetation Succession in Abandoned Fields on the Loess Plateau\\" by Wang (2002), we can see the initial dominance of the Artemisia scoparia, the pioneer species. Over time, however, the Bothriochloa ischaemum becomes the dominant species and the abundance of A. scoparia greatly declines. This is due to the rapid rate of reproduction of the A. scoparia, resulting in the species' early abundance, and the dominant competition from the K-selected B. ischaemum, resulting in that species' later abundance.Wang. ::A characteristic that is often associated with the tolerance model and well documented in forest succession is survival in conditions of shade.Connell & Slatyer, 1124-1127. As an uninhabited area becomes populated by different plant species, shade increases ‚Äì which makes less light available for the next generation. Species that are better adapted to shady conditions will then become dominant. All of the early species inhabiting the terrain have modified the environment in a way that favors a specific k-selected characteristic. :3. Inhibition Model ::In this model, one species inhibits the presence of another, either through direct means, such as predation (by eating the other species or attacking them), or indirect means, such as competition for resources. ::Sometimes in inhibition models, the time of establishment of a species determines which species becomes dominant. This phenomenon is referred to as the priority effect and suggests that the species that became established earlier are more likely to become the dominant species. One example of the inhibition model, and the priority effect, occurs in South Australia. In areas where bryozoans are established first, tunicates and sponges cannot grow.Ricklefs, 401. ::The inhibition model has also been observed at work in forest ecosystems; in these systems the early arrivers hold a monopoly on the land, keeping other species out. Closed shrub canopies have been known to prevent tree growth and access to land for periods of up to 45 years ‚Äì in an experimental study on inhibition it was found that areas occupied by large areas of Lantana sprawling shrubs excluded and inhibited the growth of tree species.Connell & Slatyer, 1125-1126.

As Doris Fish, Mills wrote and starred in the cult movie classic Vegas in Space. Art and performance=Sydney Mills began performing as Doris Fish in Sydney in 1972 as one of the three core performers of the political drag group Sylvia and the Synthetics (1972‚Äì1974), along with Miss Abood (Danny Abood, Daniel Archer) and Jacqueline Hyde. In 1975 Mills visited San Francisco for the first time on holidays, before moving there permanently the following year. Doris regularly returned to Sydney, Australia in the late 1970s, comparing shows for Cabaret conspiracy, performing in the Sydney Gay Theatre Group's production of Noel Greig's As time goes by (1979), or performing at venues such as Garibaldi's along with the Doreen's. During 1978‚Äì1979 Mills as Doris was also the American West-Coast Correspondent for Campaign, a national gay and lesbian newspaper in Australia. With the development of the Sydney Gay Mardi Gras Workshop by Peter Tully in 1983, Mills would return annually to volunteer in the Workshop building community floats and creating costumes for Doris' individual and group floats. Doris also continued to host events, including the first Mardi Gras Awards at Kinselas in 1987. San Francisco In 1976 at an audition for the rock group The Tubes, he met fellow drag queen Tippi, and they became roommates. In 1977 San Francisco gay leaders urged no drag on Gay Freedom Day. Doris and many other drags turned out in force. Also in 1977, Doris was cast in the James Moss directed feature-length film Magazine movie, a magazine format film about San Francisco, playing herself, \\"a fake woman from Australia who has won the heart of San Francisco\\".

Mills met Miss X who wasn't yet serious about doing drag, but by the end of the year Doris Fish, Tippi and Miss X were performing as Sluts-A-Go-Go. Throughout the 1980s Doris Fish was one of the more prominent drag queens in San Francisco. On stage, Doris Fish performed for over 10 years in San Francisco with Miss X and Tippi as Sluts A-Go-Go. Sluts A-Go-Go performed in venues like Club 181 with shows such as Marc Huestis' Naked Brunch, Nightclub of the Living Dead, along with other performers such as Sandelle Hebert and Tommy Pace. In 1986, Doris and Tippi did a weekly cable news show about the gay community, although some viewers complained that Doris was a negative stereotype. As a visual artist, Mills painted hyper-realistic canvases depicting of drag queens, although he once said \\"If I could, I would paint my eyeballs.\\" Mills' major legacy is the cult camp classic film Vegas in Space, which he co-wrote and starred in with Phillip Ford. Mills died from complications from AIDS in San Francisco in 1991. Recognition The life of Philip Mills as Doris featured in the one- act play Simply Stunning: The Doris Fish Story, which was performed at the Theater Rhinoceros Studio in September 2002. The script was adapted by Phillip R. Ford from biographical remarks Fish made in stage shows and in the column Fish wrote for the gay newspaper The Sentinel in the late 1980s. Ford (who also directed Mills' movie Vegas in Space) directed the play, which starred Arturo Galster In 2002, artworks by Doris were included in the Dead Gay Artists, Tin Sheds, University of Sydney, New South Wales, 1‚Äì20 February curated by Robert Lake.

Produced and originally released under the title La Vedova X, the film had theatrical release in Italy in 1955, limited release in the United States in 1957, and was released in France on June 4, 1959 under the title La Veuve. This was the last Milestone film involving his own writing. Background Lewis Milestone was affected by blacklisting during the 1950s and found it difficult to find work. He and his wife went to Paris to wait out the \\"red scare\\". While working abroad, Lewis Milestone and Diana Vedova directed La Vedova X as a joint British-Italian production. This film followed upon his work in England on Melba in 1953 and They Who Dare in 1954. This marked the last Milestone film involving his own writing. When he returned to the United States, he had to \\"scrape by\\" directing episodes for television series such as Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Schlitz Playhouse, Suspicion, and Have Gun ‚Äì Will Travel, before directing Pork Chop Hill in 1959. Plot Countess Diana Gaston (Patricia Roc) meets Vittorio Serra (Massimo Serato), the grandson of Carlo Serra, a prominent businessman. Convinced that she has met the man for her, she does all she can to keep him in her life. Unfortunately both of them are self-centered and this leads to repeated conflict. Vittorio's passion for auto racing leads to continued disagreements between him and the countess. Though remaining civil, the two separate over their disagreements even though both believe that they cannot live without the other. When Vittorio attends a party thrown by the countess, he meets Adriana (Anna Maria Ferrero), who immediately falls in love with him. His indecision over Adriana's attentions causes her to try to make him jealous, but he does not fall for the ploy. Vittorio then leaves on a trip to Sicily, he learns that Diana and Adriana have been corresponding and the jealousy does arise. Even though he loves the countess more, Vittorio asks Adriana to marry him. She refuses. When Diana learns of his proposal, she throws a tantrum and breaks objects precious to Vittirio, objects which she knows he superstitiously depends upon for luck. Vittrio then learns that out of spite, Adriana has married Bonelli (Leonardo Botta), his friend and fellow auto racer. About to compete against Bonneli in a race, and distraught at the news of the marriage, Vittorio removes his lucky bracelet. Diana has a premonition of bad fortune just before she learns the news that Vittorio has died in a racing crash. Cast * Patricia Roc as Countess Diana Gaston * Massimo Serato as Vittorio Serra * Anna Maria Ferrero as Adriana * Leonardo Botta as Leonardo Botta * Akim Tamiroff as Uncle Carlo Serra Reception Cinematografo wrote that the plot was unoriginal and uninteresting, and that Lewis Milestone's connection with the film was not enough to overcome its many flaws. Release notes While IMDb shows the film release year as being 1959, The New York Times , Rovi, The British Film Institute and the 1987 book \\"World Film Directors: 1890‚Äì1945\\" show the release year as 1955. While 1954 is shown as a release date in the Joseph R.

In 1911 the company built a smelter at China Gulch but was soon prohibited by the U.S. Forest Service which had stewardship over the land that was within the Plumas National Forest. Copper ore was hauled over road to Keddie where the ore was loaded into Western Pacific Railroad freight cars and transported to the ASARCO smelter at Garfield, Utah.

The townsite peaked in the 1920s when it reached a population of 1,200 people. In 1930 the Engels mine was closed due to the declining value of copper. However, the Indian Valley Railroad continued to operate to serve the town and residents until 1938, when the railroad and town were dismantled.

She was defeated for reelection in the new electoral district of Longueuil‚ÄîCharles-LeMoyne in the 2015 election. Early life and career Groguh√© was born on November 9, 1962 in Istres, France. The daughter of Algerian immigrants, Groguh√© was one of twelve children. She has a Master's degree, practiced as a psychologist, and did community work. In France, she worked in the area of social and occupational integration for youth and adults in distress. Trained in transactional analysis as a therapeutic tool, she held sessions as a trainer. Groguh√© was chair of the Istres equality association. She ran as an independent candidate in 1994‚Äôs cantonal election. Noticed by Jacques Siffre, Istres‚Äô socialist mayor, she ran municipally in 1995. Groguh√© was elected and was a municipal councillor from 1995 to 2000. She was responsible for integration, and left her position after the birth of her children. Groguh√© and her husband, who is originally from the Ivory Coast, decided to leave France so their children would not be discriminated against because of their background. They submitted their visa requests in 2003 and immigrated to Canada in 2005.  Federal politics  Naturalized in 2010, Groguh√© joined the New Democratic Party. She was a candidate for the party in the 2011 federal election in the Montreal riding of Saint-Lambert and defeated the incumbent Bloc MP, Jos√©e Beaudin, by receiving 42.65% of the vote. After her election, Groguh√© was appointed the NDP‚Äôs assistant critic for immigration, citizenship, and multiculturalism. Following Jack Layton's death, she supported Thomas Mulcair in the 2012 NDP leadership race. From April 19, 2012 to August 12, 2013, Groguh√© was the Deputy House Leader of the NDP and the Official Opposition. She then became the NDP's Deputy Whip, which meant she was also the Official Opposition Deputy Whip, and gave up the assistant critic portfolios she had held since 2011. In June 2014, the Board of Internal Economy found that a group of NDP MPs, including Groguh√©, had improperly used Parliamentary resources for partisan activities by sending out nearly two million mass mailings, costing 1.17 million dollars to different ridings, including some that were holding by-elections at the time. Groguh√© kept the deputy whip position until she lost her bid for re- election in the new riding of Longueuil‚ÄîSaint-Hubert in the 2015 federal election.

It had been produced by the same company, Claus Wilcke was again the star and there were also guest stars such as Iris Berben, but FBI agents weren't any longer as popular in Germany as they had been at the time of the first wave of Jerry Cotton films with George Nader. Also Elvis Presley hadn't made and feature films for a long time and subsequently German spectators were certainly less impressed by the fact that Claus Wilcke had dubbed him. However, there were no re-runs and neither has the series been released on DVD yet.

Despite resembling primitive, small horses, they were not related to them, but belonged to the native South American ungulate order Litopterna.  Description  Two subfamilies and 18 genera of Proterotheriidae are known. All forms were small or medium-sized. Typical is a reduction of the number of toes and brachydont or mesodont teeth. The family is recorded since the late Palaeocene. Various fossils are known from many parts of the South American continent. The diversity decreased in the Miocene to Pliocene and it has been assumed for a long time that they entirely disappeared in the late Pliocene. However, fossils found in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay show that one member of the group, Neolicaphrium recens survived into the Late Pleistocene. Better known genera of the family include Diadiaphorus and Thoatherium from the Miocene.

Legend of the Phantosaur is a 2011 television animated comedy mystery film; the sixteenth direct-to-video movie based upon the Scooby-Doo Saturday morning cartoons, the film was released on September 6, 2011. It premiered on Cartoon Network on September 3, 2011. Plot The Mystery Inc. gang travels to a remote town to stay at the La Serena Spa in New Mexico, to relax Shaggy after a scary experience in a haunted mansion left him screaming for a few hours afterward. There, they meet Mr. Hubley, who works at the spa. When Shaggy asks if there is anything to eat, Hubley says no, but there is a barbecue in town. The gang goes to the barbecue, and all but Shaggy and Scooby-Doo go off to see the paleontological dig of Professor Svankmajer. Shaggy and Scooby are too full to walk right away. When they set out, a gila monster steals a biscuit from them, causing Scooby to go after it. He meets the Phantosaur (described as somewhat resembling an Appalachiosaurus by Professor Svankmajer) and runs away. Later, Shaggy and Scooby are chased by the Phantosaur and narrowly escape. Meanwhile, Professor Svankmajor shows the rest of the gang over the dig, and Velma meets Svankmajor's student, Winsor. She instantly sees him as a soul mate and they plan to go out on a date, to which Fred replies to Daphne, \\"On our own for clue searching then.\\" Back at the spa, Shaggy is in terrible shape after a fright. Mr. Hubley helps with aromatherapy, assisted by Scooby-Doo adding a Scooby Snack to the aromas. Shaggy becomes more calm, but freaks out again when Mr. Hubley tells them the legend of the Phantosaur, the ghost of a predatory dinosaur. The legend says the Phantosaur was summoned by Native Americans to drive out Spanish conquistadors, but it turned on them instead. Hubley has an advanced hypnosis machine with a hologram projector. He hypnotizes Shaggy to become fearless and unstoppable when he heard the word \\"bad,\\" and to switch back to normal when he hears it again. Then he orders Shaggy to forget everything; unfortunately, Hubley himself is affected by the hypnosis and he can't remember the key word for Shaggy. Daphne, Fred, and Velma go back to the dig to look for clues, but Velma is so love struck that she's not much use. She misses an obvious clue about many footprints going to a part of the cave where Winsor says they never go because of the snakes that lurk in the lower cave levels. Meanwhile, Scooby and Shaggy go to an all-you-can-eat restaurant and start to eat it out of business. Then a biker gang comes in. Shaggy accidentally squirts the contents of a hot dog bun on one of the bikers, who angrily grabs him and tells him, \\"Little buddy, this is gonna be bad.\\" Suddenly, Shaggy is fearless. He knocks out the whole motorcycle gang and repels all their assaults on him. Then the gang leader, a large, muscly man named Tex, arrives and, taking an admitted liking to Shaggy, challenges him to a motorcycle race on Dead Man's curve. Shaggy confidently accepts, even though he's never ridden a motorcycle before. As Tex leaves the restaurant, he tells Shaggy that he won't kill Shaggy \\"too bad.\\". Suddenly back to normal, Shaggy is terrified of the challenge he has just accepted, and by what he has just done to the rest of the gang. That night, Daphne decides to give him motorcycling lessons, because she drove a motorcycle when she was five. Shaggy and Tex have their motorcycle race as planned, and Shaggy hears \\"bad\\" just in time and almost wins, until a Phantosaur shows up and he thinks in his mind that the monster must think it's so \\"bad,\\" which is enough to make him cowardly again and get chased, but still miraculously wins the race. Eventually, they figure out that there were two phantosaurs and they were robots. The culprits were two mining engineers who wanted the silver they found in the area, which they couldn't get to because of the paleontologists. Once back at Hubley's they find the hologram projector gone and they get attacked by a pack of Velociraptor and a ghostly fire- breathing Tyrannosaurus. They learn that it was Professor Svankmajer and Winsor, much to Velma's dismay. They had found a complete Allosaurus encased in quartz crystal, a beautiful and priceless find, and they wanted to keep it for themselves. They wanted to scare everyone off so they could dig it out and take it away. They disguised three other graduate students in velociraptor costumes, and created an original red Phantosaur with an advanced holographic projector (stolen from Hubley's hypnotism room) and paint-stripper devices that blasted super-heated air for the fire effects. While they are underground, the dynamite charges Svankmajor set to blast free the dinosaur crystal go off (because Daphne left a paint-stripper on and the heat lit the fuses). Shaggy's hypnotic bravery comes in again when Svankmejer comments on how \\"bad\\" the lower caverns are, and he flawlessly leads them toward the exit until Daphne praises him that he's \\"not bad.\\" Scooby realizes the keyword but is unable to tell the rest of the gang (who misunderstand his \\"rad\\" as other words). Shaggy has to complete the rest of the escape on sheer guts, and with some help from Tex and his biker friends. The remorseful Svankmajer and Winsor are arrested, but Velma says she will date Winsor again when he gets out of jail, which he happily agrees with. They then go back to La Serena Spa and Mr. Hubley tries to un-hypnotize Shaggy, but accidentally makes the entire gang turn into him. The end of the movie shows them driving away in the \\"Mustard\\" Machine. A post-credits scene reveals the \\"Mustard\\" Machine wearing a wig that looks like Shaggy's hairstyle. The GPS inside the van says aloud that if it had hands, it would remove the wig, but as such, it has none.

The video earned millions of views and spawned the \\"Ultra Instinct Shaggy\\" meme depicting Shaggy Rogers as an omnipotent power, with subsequent fan art showing him beating other fictional characters such as Marvel Comics character Thanos and Goku from the Dragon Ball franchise, as well as using still images and footage of the behind the scenes look at the 2002 Scooby-Doo film with fake subtitles to make it seem as if Shaggy is a powerful being. At the same time as the meme gained popularity in January 2019, the then-upcoming video game Mortal Kombat 11 was being marketed and thus a petition was made on Change.org by Woken News Network to include the character as DLC. The petition received hundreds of thousands of signatures even gaining attention of Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon, and Shaggy's voice actor Matthew Lillard. Lillard had previously tweeted posts and retweeted fan art in support of the idea as well as Boon jokingly petitioning to get Scooby Doo into another NetherRealm Studios game Injustice 2. It was later confirmed that Shaggy would never appear in any Mortal Kombat game.

She was elected president of the BC Teachers' Federation in 2004 and served in that role until 2007. In her role as president of the BCTF, she was involved in the May 2005 provincial election when the BC Liberal Party, a week before the election, accused the BCTF of having a \\"secret plan\\" to strike two days after the election; the organization subsequently filed a defamation lawsuit. When the teachers, who had been working for over a year without a contract, did provide strike notice in September 2005, the provincial government immediately extended, by legislation, the last contract to June 2006 and made a potential strike illegal. Regardless, Sims led the teachers in job action, culminating in a two-week strike. The Labour Relations Board determined the strike illegal and the BC Supreme Court found the BCTF in civil contempt of court, fined the BCTF $500,000 and ordered the BCTF not pay the teachers a strike pay. The strike ended when the membership voted to accept a $150-million mediated settlement which both the government and the BCTF executive had endorsed.

This protrusion may contain material which is actively transferred between the cells. The process of paracytophagy was first described as a crucial step during cell-to-cell spread of the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, and is also commonly observed in Shigella flexneri. Paracytophagy allows these intracellular pathogens to spread directly from cell to cell, thus escaping immune detection and destruction. Studies of this process have contributed significantly to our understanding of the role of the actin cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. Actin cytoskeleton Schematic of actin comet tail formation by Listeria using ActA. The nucleation complex Arp2/3 is recruited to ActA, a WASP mimic. Actin filament polymerization then takes place at the posterior end of the bacterium, propelling it through the host cell cytoplasm in the anterior direction. Actin is one of the main cytoskeletal proteins in eukaryotic cells. The polymerization of actin filaments is responsible for the formation of pseudopods, filopodia and lamellipodia during cell motility. Cells actively build actin microfilaments that push the cell membrane towards the direction of advance.Molecular Biology of the Cell. 4th edition. Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, et al. New York: Garland Science; 2002. Nucleation factors and the Arp2/3 complex Nucleation factors are enhancers of actin polymerization and contribute to the formation of the trimeric polymerization nucleus. This is a structure required to initiate the process of actin filament polymerization in a stable and efficient way. Nucleation factors such as WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) help to form the seven-protein Arp2/3 nucleation complex, which resembles two actin monomers and therefore allows for easier formation of the polymerization nucleus. Arp2/3 is able to cap the trailing (\\"minus\\") end of the actin filament, allowing for faster polymerization at the \\"plus\\" end. It can also bind to the side of existing filaments to promote filament branching.Cellular Microbiology, 2nd Ed., edited by Pascale Cossart, Patrice Boquet, and Staffan Normark and Rino Rappuoli.Washington, DC: ASM Press; 2005. WASP analogs used by pathogens for intracellular motility Certain intracellular pathogens such as the bacterial species Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella flexneri can manipulate host cell actin polymerization to move through the cytosol and spread to neighboring cells (see below). Studies of these bacteria, especially of Listeria Actin assembly-inducing protein (ActA), have resulted in further understanding of the actions of WASP. ActA is a nucleation promoting factor that mimics WASP. It is expressed polarized to the posterior end of the bacterium, allowing Arp2/3-mediated actin nucleation. This pushes the bacterium in the anterior direction, leaving a trailing \\"comet tail\\" of actin. In the case of Shigella, which also moves using an actin comet tail, the bacterial factor recruits host cell WASPs in order to promote actin nucleation. Exchange of cellular material between adjacent cells Cells can exchange material through various mechanisms, such as by secreting proteins, releasing extracellular vesicles such as exosomes or microvesicles, or more directly engulfing pieces of adjacent cells. In one example, filopodia-like protrusions, or tunneling nanotubes directed toward neighboring cells in a culture of rat PC12 cells have been shown to facilitate transport of organelles through transient membrane fusion. In another example, during bone marrow homing, cells of the surrounding bone engulf pieces of bone marrow hematopoietic cells. These osteoblasts make contact with hematopoietic stem- progenitor cells through membrane nanotubes, and pieces of the donor cells are transferred over time to various endocytic compartments of the target osteoblasts. A distinct process known as trogocytosis, the exchange of lipid rafts or membrane patches between immune cells, can facilitate response to foreign stimuli. Moreover, exosomes have been shown to deliver not only antigens for cross-presentation, but also MHCII and co-stimulatory molecules for lymphocyte T activation. In non-immune cells, it has been demonstrated that mitochondria can be exchanged intercellularly to rescue metabolically non-viable cells lacking mitochondria. Mitochondrial transfer has also been observed in cancer cells. Argosomes and melanosomes Argosomes are derived from basolateral epithelial membranes and allow communication between adjacent cells. They were first described in Drosophila melanogaster, where they act as a vehicle for the spread of molecules through the epithelia of imaginal discs. Melanosomes are also transferred by filopodia from melanocytes to keratinocytes. This transfer involves a classic filopodial forming pathway, with Cdc42 and WASP as key factors. Argosomes, melanosomes, and other examples of epithelial transfer have been compared with the process of paracytophagy, all of which can be viewed as special cases of intercellular material transfer between epithelial cells. Role in the life cycle of intracellular pathogens Stages in the intracellular life-cycle of Listeria monocytogenes. (Center) Cartoon depicting entry, escape from a vacuole, actin nucleation, actin-based motility, and cell-to-cell spread. (Outside) Representative electron micrographs from which the cartoon was derived. The two main examples of paracytophagy are the modes of cell-cell transmission of Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella flexneri. In the case of Listeria, the process was first described in detail using electron microscopy and video microscopy. The following is a description of the process of cell-cell transmission of Listeria monocytogenes, primarily based on Robbins et al. (1999): Early events In an already infected \\"donor\\" cell, the Listeria bacterium expresses ActA, which results in formation of the actin comet tail and movement of the bacterium throughout the cytoplasm. When the bacterium encounters the donor cell membrane, it will either ricochet off it or adhere to it and begin to push outwards, distending the membrane and forming a protrusion of 3-18 Œºm. The close interaction between the bacterium and the host cell membrane is thought to depend on Ezrin, a member of the ERM family of membrane-associated proteins. Ezrin attaches the actin-propelled bacterium to the plasma membrane by crosslinking the actin comet tail to the membrane, and maintains this interaction throughout the protrusion process. Invasion of target cell and secondary vacuole formation As the normal site of infection is the gut columnar epithelium, cells are packed closely together and a cell protrusion from one cell will easily push into a neighboring \\"target\\" cell without rupturing the target cell membrane or the donor protrusion membrane. At this point, the bacterium at the tip of the protrusion will begin to undergo \\"fitful movement\\" caused by continuing polymerization of actin at its rear. After 7‚Äì15 minutes, the donor cell membrane pinches off and fitful movement ceases for 15‚Äì25 minutes due to depletion of ATP. Subsequently, the target membrane pinches off (taking 30‚Äì150 seconds) and the secondary vacuole containing the bacterium forms inside the target cell cytoplasm. Secondary vacuole breakdown and target cell infection Within 5 minutes, the target cell becomes infected when the secondary vacuole begins to acidify and the inner (donor cell-derived) membrane breaks down through the action of bacterial phospholipases (PI-PLC and PC-PLC). Shortly thereafter, the outer membrane breaks down as a result of the actions of the bacterial protein listeriolysin O which punctures the vacuolar membrane. A cloud of residual donor cell-derived actin persists around the bacterium for up to 30 minutes. The bacterial metalloprotease Mpl cleaves ActA in a pH-dependent fashion while the bacterium is still within the acidified secondary vacuole, but new ActA transcription is not required as pre-existing ActA mRNA can be utilized to translate new ActA protein. The bacterium regains motility and the infection proceeds. Cartoon of paracytophagy during Listeria infection, progressing to secondary vacuole formation and escape. Impact on disease The most severe symptoms of Listeriosis result from involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). These severe and often fatal symptoms include meningitis, rhombencephalitis, and encephalitis. These forms of disease are a direct result of Listeria pathogenicity mechanisms at the cellular level. Listerial infection involving the CNS can occur via three known routes: through the blood, through intracellular delivery, or through neuronal intracellular spread. Paracytophagous cell to cell spread offers Listeria access to the CNS by the latter two mechanisms. Paracytophagy in CNS infection by Listeria In peripheral tissues, Listeria can invade cells such as monocytes and dendritic cells from infected endothelial cells via the paracytophagous mode of invasion. Using these phagocytic cells as vectors, Listeria travels throughout the nerves and reaches tissues usually inaccessible to other bacterial pathogens. Similar to the mechanism seen in HIV, infected leukocytes in the blood cross the blood brain barrier and transport Listeria into the CNS. Once in the CNS, cell to cell spreading causes associated damage leading to brain encephalitis and bacterial meningitis. Listeria uses phagocytic leukocytes as a ‚ÄúTrojan Horse‚Äù to gain access to a greater range of target cells. In one study, mice treated with gentamycin via infusion pump displayed CNS and brain involvement during infection with Listeria, indicating that the population of bacteria responsible for severe pathogenesis resided within cells and was protected from the circulating antibiotic. Macrophages infected with Listeria pass the infection on to neurons more easily through paracytophagy than through extracellular invasion by free bacteria. The mechanism which specifically targets these infected cells to the CNS is currently not known. This Trojan horse function is also observed and thought to be important in early stages of infection where gut-to-lymph node infection is mediated by infected dendritic cells. A second mechanism of reaching the brain tissue is achieved through intra-axonal transport. In this mechanism, Listeria travels along the nerves to the brain, resulting in encephalitis or transverse myelitis. In rats, the dorsal root ganglia can be infected directly by Listeria, and the bacteria can move in retrograde as well as anterograde direction through the nerve cells. The specific mechanisms involved in brain disease are not yet known, but paracytophagy is thought to have some role. Bacteria have not been shown to infect neuronal cells directly in an efficient manner, and the previously described macrophage hand-off is thought to be necessary for this mode of spread.

She was one of five candidates, alongside Myl√®ne Freeman, Matthew Dub√©, Charmaine Borg and Jamie Nicholls, who were McGill University students when elected in the 2011 election following the NDP's unexpected mid-campaign surge in Quebec.\\"McGill 5 head off to House of Commons\\". The Gazette, May 4, 2011. In the 2015 election, all were defeated with the exception of Dub√©. At the time of her election in 2011, she was pursuing a double major in History and Cultural Studies. Following the 2015 election, Liu completed a master's degree in Human Rights at the London School of Economics.  Early life  Liu was raised in Pointe-Claire, Quebec. Prior to attending McGill, she was a student at Royal West Academy and Coll√®ge Jean-de-Br√©beuf. At Jean-de-Br√©beuf, she became politically active by founding the NDP campus club. She later moved on to be co-president of the youth wing of the Quebec section of the NDP. She was active on campus as a board member of CKUT radio, a representative to the CKUT Programming Committee, an employee of McGill University's undergraduate student union, and a staff member of the McGill Daily. Liu, whose parents came to Canada from Guangzhou in the 1980s, is fluent in French, English, and Cantonese.  MP for Rivi√®re-des-Mille-√éles  Liu had not expected to win, and spent most of the campaign helping NDP Quebec lieutenant Thomas Mulcair win reelection. She was working in a polling station in Mulcair's Outremont riding as an NDP scrutineer when a friend texted her that she was leading Bloc Qu√©b√©cois incumbent Luc Desnoyers. Ultimately, she defeated Desnoyers by a staggering 11,000-vote margin. By comparison, no NDP candidate had finished higher than fourth since the riding's creation in 1997, and all previous NDP challengers had failed to garner the 10% necessary for their expenses to be refunded.

Changes of name It was founded in 2004 as Wayang Party, and renamed Temasek Review in 2009, using an old name for Singapore. In late 2010, it was involved in a dispute with government-linked corporation Temasek Holdings over its name. Temasek Holdings argued that Temasek Review had been used as the name of the company's annual report since 2004 and that the Javanese word Temasek was \\"indisputably associated with Temasek [Holdings]\\" and that the website \\"was just trying to capitalise on the goodwill and reputation\\" linked to it. The website was renamed Temasek Review Emeritus on 25 May 2011. After a period offline, it was relaunched as TR Emeritus in December of that year. The shortened name was chosen to avoid trademark complications with Temasek Holdings. Closure and relaunch in 2011 Facing restrictions in both income and contributors, and unable to upgrade hardware to cope with increasing demand, the site's editor Amanda Tan announced on 7 April 2011 that it would close in July. She acknowledged the existence of pressure from the Government, but said that its effects were minimal and there had been no direct official request to close. Ang Peng Hwa, professor of journalism at Nanyang Technological University, described the closure as \\"definitely a loss for the blogsphere and also for critical discourse in Singapore\\". In late April 2011, Temasek Review complained that it had been hit with a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack during the height of the 2011 general elections campaign coverage.http://www2.irrawaddy.com/article.php?art_id=21174&page;=2 Another online site, The Online Citizen, made a similar announcement. Temasek Review was recorded by Experian Hitwise as receiving a significant proportion of internet traffic from search engines during the campaign. In August 2011, Tan announced that the website had gained additional financial support and that the team behind it intended to keep it running for at least five years. She also pledged \\"to improve and try to balance the articles on our site to cater to readers from all camps,\\" aiming to be \\"by Singaporeans for Singaporeans\\". Temasek Review Emeritus was taken offline without explanation on 5 September 2011.

She is also popularly referred to as \\"Parama Shakti\\", \\"Adi Shakti\\", \\"Mahashakti\\" , \\"Mahadevi\\" \\"Mahagauri\\", \\"Mahakali\\", Satyam Shakti, or even simply as \\"Shakti\\". \\"Parama\\" means absolute, \\"Satya\\" means the Truth as per many Shakta texts.Srimad Devi Bhagwatam, Devi Gita, Brahmand Purana, In Hinduism, Shaktas believe goddess Parvati as Adi Parashakti and regard her as the supreme being. Etymology Adi Parashakti means \\"First Supreme-energy\\". ‡§Ü‡§¶‡§ø ƒÅdi literally means \\"beginning\\". Shakti refers to a power beyond the physical universe; the term itself comes from the root ‡§∂‡§ï‡•ç ≈õak, meaning \\"to be able,\\" from PIE *·∏±ak-. Importance  In the Devi Gita, it is suggested that before incarnating as Parvathi, she appeared to King Himalaya and revealed divine, eternal knowledge to him. She explained herself, in the words of the Vedas, as having neither beginning nor end. She is the only, eternal truth. The whole universe is her creation. She is the only victor and the manifestation of victory itself. She is a manifested, un-manifested and transcendent divinity. She then displayed her scarcely seen form to him: Satyaloka was located in her forehead; the created universe were her hairs; the sun and moon were her eyes; in her ears were the four directions; the Vedas were her words; death, affection and emotion were her teeth; maya was manifested by her smile. Adi Parashakti in Hinduism Goddess Adi ParaShakthi is the Presiding Deity at the Parashakthi Temple in Pontiac Michigan, USA Except for Shakta Puranas, Adi Shakti has never been mentioned with the name \\"Adi Shakti\\". But indirectly, they also consider her to be the supreme being. Scriptures like Devi Bhagwata Purana, four Vedas consider Kali as Dark energy which dissolutes the complete universe along with time. The goddess Parvati as Kushmanda gives birth to the universe in the form of an cosmic egg which manifests as the universe. Ultimately, Adi Shakti herself is the zero energy which exists even after destruction of the universe and before its creation. In Shaiva Puranas Shiva Purana says Adi Parashakti incarnated in materialistic form as Parama Prakriti from the left half of Lord Shiva i.e.Parabrahman Paramshiva during the beginning of the Universe. Linga Purana states that Adi Shakti brings forth the evolution of life in every Universe through the union of every Parvati and Shiva in all of the Universes. Skanda Purana and Markandeya Purana talks about Parvati as divine mother of all creation and truest material form of Adi Shakti.Shiva Mahapurana  Gitapress Gorakhpur In Shakta Puranas The \\"Devi Bhaagwata Purana\\" says that Shiva worshipped and meditated on Adi Parashakti for thousands of years, using the beeja mantra \\"Hreem\\". She then manifested one of her Shaktis in front of him in the form of Sidhidaatri from the left half of Lord Shiva . The Goddess Adi Parashakti is also considered to be both the truly supreme spirit without form (Param Atman) and Saguna with form. In her Saguna form she is described as the Mother of the Universe and is residing in Sarvaloka Manidweepa above all of the other Paralokas. She is the Great Goddess, and all other goddesses and even all the Gods are her various forms, says the Devi Gita from Shakti Mahabhagawata Purana.Sri Bhagwati Gita  Devi Gita  Sri Parvati Gita ‚Äì Scribd  https://www.scribd.com/doc/147548723/Sri-Bhagwati- Gita-Devi-Gita-Sri-Parvati-Gita In Devi Mahatmyam, Trimurti and demigods praises Adi Shakti: Shrishti Sthiti Vinasham Shakti Bhute Sanatane Guna Shaye (Devoid of all attributes i.e. Nirgun) Gana maye (Having all the attributes) Narayani NamaustuteMatri ‚Äì Dhyan ‚Äì Anandamayi Ma  anandamayi.org/chant/chant.htm Meaning: We bow to the first female (Narayani), The eternal energy who creates, sustains and destroys all the elements i.e. tatva and the one who is truly the supreme spirit (Nirgun) at the time who encapsulates all the attributes for Generation, Observation and Destruction. Adi Parashakti in Sikhism Sikhism also portrays the concept of Adi Shakti. The difference is in the philosophy. In Sikhism, Khanda, the symbol of the infinite power of God, is referred as \\"Adi Shakti\\" in Hinduism. Durga, one of the Sakthis of Adi Shakti as per Hinduism, are manifestations of Adi Shakti to destroy demons as described in Chandi di Var. Role in creation In Srimad Devi Bhagwat Purana's 1st book and 4th chapter. Devi addressed Trimurti as follows: \\"I am Adi Parashakti. I am the owner of this universe. I am the Absolute Reality. I am dynamic in feminine form and static in masculine form. You have appeared to govern the universe through my energy. You are the masculine form of Absolute Reality, while I am the feminine form of that Reality. I am beyond form, beyond everything, and all the powers of God are contained within me. You must know that I am the Eternal limitless energy. She then said: Brahma! You will be generator of the universe; the Goddess Sharada (Saraswati) is your consort, she will be recognized as the goddess of wisdom and the primeval sound. Lord Brahma, this goddess will be with you when you create the universe. She continued: Lord Narayana (Vishnu)! You are formless, yet you take form. I assign you to be the preserver of the universe. You will take a different incarnations in order to save this universe's inhabitants. Oh Narayana! You have created Lord Brahma, and Brahma will further create thirty three kind of gods and goddesses. I am goddess Mahamaya, I reappear from your mystic sleep. Your consort will be goddess Lakshmi. Lord Vishnu, this goddess will be with you when you rule/maintain the universe. When life evolves, you will take the form of Vishnu, the one who will perform the task of observing and preserving this universe. At Last she instructed: Oh Lord Rudra Shiv, the Great God, you are the personification of time, which is above all. You will perform the task of destroying and regenerating this universe. When you are formless, time stands still. It is due to my power that you become dynamic and are capable of bringing about the destruction and regeneration of this universe. Mahakali is myself, my full form, whereas Laxmi and Saraswati are just my clone, partial form but due to meditation, you will surpass all my forms. It is then that I will incarnate from your left half in my manifested form. This form will be my truest manifested form. Lord Shiva, she will perform the task of destroying evil and will be your consort. Association with other deities= Association with Navagraha or nine planets  Adi Shakti is regarded as the one who can control all the nine planets. She divides herself to Material Shakti i.e. Durga who splits herself to operate nine planets to maintain cosmic order, Vidya Shakti i.e. Kali as source for 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu and Maya Shakti, to delude the beings to illusion and also promotes the beings to Ultimate God. As Durga Shakti She is the one who splits herself to NavaDurga provides direction and energy to all planets. ** Sun is Governed by Kushmanda Shakti. ** Mahagauri operates Rahu. ** Kaalratri governs Shani. ** Ketu is governed by Goddess Siddhidaatri. ** Provider of Knowledge i.e. Bhrasapati is governed by Goddess Katyayini ** Provider of All Fortunes i.e. Mangal is governed by Goddess Brahmacharini ** The effect of moon is overcome by Goddess Shailaputri ** Budh Planet is governed by Goddess Skandamata ** Shukra Planet is operated by Goddess Chandraghanta By this contrast Goddess Adi Shakti controls Nava Graha. Worshipping the nine goddess in Navaratri or Nine nights of mataji, saves you from dangerous effects of planets. Association with Beings (demi-gods, living beings and demons) Goddess Mahakali lastly splits up as Maya, Mahamaya and Yogmaya. It is she who actually creates three kinds of Maya such that One subordinate another. In this respect, we have Yogmaya, Mahamaya and Maya. =Yoga Maya= Adi Parashakti is the one who actually creates maya for gods and teaches them what to do and what not to do so that they can be connected to the ultimate God. She helped Lord Vishnu to slay the demons Madhu and Kaitabha to save the world. Moreover, she is also the one that who takes Lord Vishnu to mystic sleep hence called Yog Nindra of Lord Narayana. It is required by yogis, sages and bhaktas so that they can be connected to God. Shaktas consider her as the form of goddess Parvati, while Vaishnavas consider her as godess Lakshmi. =Mahamaya= She is the goddess that destroys the upfold of illusion. She is the one that creates and destroys maya. She is controlled by Yogmaya and hence subordinate to YogMaya and senior to Maya. She emerges as seven mothers to destroy evil forces of Shumbha and Nishumbha, Being Chamunda one of them. She is required to gain physical strength, health, satvik attributes and demotes anger, greed and arrogance. Vaishnavas consider her as Lakshmi while the Shaktas consider her as form of Parvati =Maya= She is the one who delude living beings from god and takes any being to the world of illusion. She promotes greed, anger, and arrogance. It is assumed that in the Age of Kali Yuga, her effect is highest.Srimad Bhagwata Purana Adi Parashakti Forms Devi Parvati is the full and complete incarnation of the goddess. Parvati was Sati in her previous birth. Sati was also a direct incarnation of Adi Parashakti. However, Sati died and was reborn as Parvati. Parvati is shown as kind and loving mother goddess. She can take various forms including Kali, Durga, Chandi, etc. According to Shakta traditions, Lalita tripurasundari is the form of Devi Parvati who is the ultimate god. Lalita Tripurasundari holds a sugarcane bow, flower arrows, noose, and goad. She came down from her loka above this Brahmanda to destroy Bhandasura and now is living on the top of Maha Meru mountain. Her abode is pictorially represented as Sri Chakra. Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva of this Brahmanda are her subordinates and cannot function without her power. Thus, she is considered the supreme Goddess and primary deity in Shaktism as she is the nearest representative of Adi Parashakti. Whatever deity one is worshiping, ultimately, they are worshiping Adi Parashakti. She took various incarnations over a period of time for upholding Dharma. As per the yogis of the highest order, she is the power who resides in the Kundalini in the form of Amba, she is 31/2 coil in size and when the Kundalini is raised from the sacrum bone of every human being by a highly realized soul whose kundalini is also awakened then she rises through the back bone of the human opening all chakras mooladhara, Swadisthana, manipura, anahata, vishuddi, Agnya and finally through sahasrara chakras and connects the soul to the all pervading power (or collective consciousness) of the divine On the three nadis, Ida (Left channel- Tamo guna), Pingala (Right channel-Rajo Guna) and Sushumna (central channel-Sattva guna), the kundalini passes through the central channel balancing all the left and right channel. Kali is the third part of Goddess Adi Para Shakti. She is the goddess of power, spiritual fulfillment, time, as well as presiding over the destruction of the universe. She gives salvation to mankind. Shaktas consider her as the incarnation of Parvati and consort of Lord Shiva's incarnation Mahakal, while Vaishnavas consider her as an incarnation of Lakshmi and consort of Vishnu. She helped Lord Maha Vishnu slay the demons Madhu and Kaitabha. It is she who also slew Shumbha and Nishumbha in the form of kousiki, who are symbols of ignorance. She is also same as Yogmaya also known as Tamsi Devi and Chandi Devi as per Durga Saptashati. She wears red or black and presides over the Tamas Guna. When Kali is formless, she becomes the sound of Kreem. In her gentler form as Durga, she becomes the sound of Kleem. Worship The Sri Yantra in diagrammatic form, showing how its nine interlocking triangles form a total of 43 smaller triangles. Shaktas claim that it is assumed that indirectly or directly, everybody worships her. When, someone is utilizing his/her energy in positive aspects of life then they are worshiping her. Hypothetically Shaktas assume, since, she is absolute Energy, so when one knows how to raise his/her inner energy and knows how to balance that energy for daily work then ultimately, they are worshiping her. To balance Energy for day-to-day life, people worship their personal gods/God as per their religion, enlighten candles and lamps at home, do good work for society and much more. All these activities either energize them or serve as methods to gain motivation. Many scholars like Swami Vivekananda prefers meditation as best practice to stop mental impurities as he said Holy meditation helps to burn out all mental impurities and claims that to know one's own energy is best method to worship Divine Mother. Though core shakta people believe in direct worship of Adi Shakti through dhyan, Meditation and Samadhi, Tantra, Sri chakra and traditional deity worship. While worshiping her through yoga, Samadhi or through Tantra, one needs proper adherent guru, who himself or herself must know all the rules and rituals. If someone who doesn't have proper guru, then one can also worship her by singing her praise. Iconography Adi Parashakti's appearance is described in the Kalika Purana, the Markandeya Purana-Devi Mahatmya,the Brahmanda Purana-Lalita Sahasranama, and the Devi Bhagavata Purana. According to the Devi Bhagavata Purana, Devi gita. The Goddess once invited the Trimurti to her celestial abode. The Trimurti saw the goddess sitting on a jeweled seat in a throne. Her face contained the radiance of millions of stars and her celestial beauty was so great that the Trimurti were not able to look at her. She carries the surya mudra, pasha, ankusha and lotus. They then realized that she was the energy responsible for creating, preserving, and destroying the whole universe. According to the Devi Bhagwat Purana, Shaktas consider Adishakti as Parvati ‚Äì the consort of Shiva, while the Vaishnavas consider Adishakti as Lakshmi - consort of Vishnu.

It is a well-known commercial species of Chionoecetes, often caught with traps or by trawling. Seven species are in the genus Chionoecetes, all of which bear the name \\"snow crab\\". C. opilio is related to C. bairdi, commonly known as the tanner crab, and other crab species found in the cold, northern oceans.  Anatomy  Snow crabs have equally long and wide carapaces, or protective shell-coverings, over their bodies. Their tubercles, or the bodily projections on their shells, are moderately enclosed in calcium deposits, and they boast hooked setae, which are rigid, yet springy, hair-like organs on their claws. Snow crabs have a horizontal rostrum at the front of the carapace; the rostrum is basically just an extension of the hard, shell covering of the carapace and it boasts two flat horns separated by a gap. They have triangular spines and well- defined gastric and branchial regions internally. Snow crabs also have little granules along the border of their bodies, except their intestinal region. Concerning their walking legs, their first three are compressed; their chelipeds, or pincers, are usually smaller, shorter, or equal to their walking legs. Snow crabs are iridescent and range in color from brown to light red on top and from yellow to white on the bottom, and are bright white on the sides of their feet.  Distribution and habitat  Snow crabs are native to the Northwest Atlantic and the North Pacific. In the Northwest Atlantic, they are found in the areas near Greenland, Newfoundland, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and on the Scotian Shelf. In the North Pacific, this crab is found in areas ranging from Alaska to northern Siberia, and through the Bering Strait to the Aleutian Islands, Japan, and Korea. In 1996, they were recorded in the Barents Sea for the first time. They are considered an invasive species there, but how they arrived there is unclear. Another commercially important species, introduced deliberately to the same region, the red king crab, already has established itself in Barents Sea. Similarly, snow crabs likely will have an adverse effect on the native species of the Barents Sea. Snow crabs are found in the ocean's shelf and upper slope, on sandy and muddy bottoms. They are found at depths from , but average is about . In Atlantic waters, most snow crabs are found at depths of . Where male and female snow crabs are found in the ocean, depths may vary. Small adult and senescent adult males occur mainly at intermediate depths over much of the year, while large and hardy adult males are found mostly at depths greater than . Adult females are gregarious and congregate at depths of . Snow crabs mainly reside in very cold waters, between , but can be found at temperatures up to .  Diet  C. opilio crabs eat other invertebrates in the benthic shelf, such as crustaceans, bivalves, brittle stars, polychaetes, and even phytobenthos and foraminiferans. Snow crabs also are scavengers, and aside from preying on other benthic shelf invertebrates, they prey on annelid worms and mollusks. Males typically prove to be better predators than mature females, and prey type depends upon predator size, with the smallest crabs feeding mainly on amphipods and ophiuroids, while the largest crabs feed mainly on annelids, crustacean decapods, and fish. Cannibalism is practised at times among snow crabs, most frequently by intermediate-sized females.  Size and population structure  Two snow crabs with the larger male perched on top of the female, Bonne Bay, Newfoundland, Canada The snow crab grows slowly and is structured according to its size. At least 11 stages of growth for male crabs are recognized. Usually, the male crabs are almost twice the size of the female crabs. Males can grow up to in carapace width, while females can grow up to . Male carapaces are usually about in width and length, with the female carapace usually close to in width and length. Males caught in commercial fisheries generally weigh and females generally about . Off the coast of Newfoundland, two amphipod species ‚Äì Ischyrocerus commensalis and Gammaropsis inaequistylis ‚Äì have been found to live on the carapace of the snow crab.  Breeding patterns  Snow crabs have a very high reproductive potential; each year, every female carries eggs. Females are fertilised internally and can carry up to 150,000 eggs under their abdomens after mating. Females usually lay their eggs in very deep areas of the ocean, such as in deposits of phytodetritus. Males also are capable of mating at both immature and mature stages of their lives. Adult snow crabs usually live to 5-6 years. Before their deaths, they usually moult, mate a final time, and die. New snow crab offspring hatch along with the late spring phytoplankton bloom, so they have an ample food source to take advantage of upon hatching. When they hatch, they are in the zoeal stage, meaning that they are developing into larvae that can swim on their own. Then, they metamorphose into the megalopa stage and settle to the ocean floor among the phytodetritus.  Commercial importance  This species of crab was commonly caught by trappers in the 1980s, but trapping has decreased since then. Much of the trapping has been in Canada for commercial use. The first commercial fishing for the species in the Barents Sea (where it is an invasive species) began in 2013, and the stock of this region likely will reach levels similar to eastern Canada in the future. Since 2016, the snow crab is at the center of a dispute over fishing rights between Norway and the EU. The EU is of the view that the crab can be freely caught by EU fishers in the international waters in the Barents Sea. Norway, for its part, argues that the crab is not a fish but a sedentary species, and therefore subject to the jurisdiction Norway exercises over the continental shelf. The Norwegian Supreme Court adopted this view in a 2019 decision. Taxonomy The species was first described by Otto Fabricius in 1780, under the name Cancer phalangium, a name that was invalid due to Johan Christian Fabricius having used it previously for the species now known as Inachus phalangium. The first valid scientific name was provided by Otto Fabricius in 1788, when he redescribed the species as Cancer opilio. The type locality is Greenland. As the genus Cancer was divided up, the species C. opilio was transferred to a new genus, Chionoecetes by Henrik Nikolai Kr√∏yer in 1838. C. opilio was the only species in the genus at first, so it is the type species. Mary J. Rathbun described a subspecies, C. o. elongatus, in 1924. This is now generally recognised as a full species, Chionoecetes elongatus.

When she dies tragically, Zoe is devastated and drops his budding career, moves back home, and pines after his departed love for a year. His father, the principal of an elementary school, decides that one year of moping around the house is enough and forces Zoe to take a job teaching kindergarten, Zoe finds himself standing before a very different demographic.

Critical reception The film received generally negative reviews: The Village Voice offered \\"for a film about a stand-up comedian to be mirthless is dispiriting\\" and expanded that The Stand Up did not compensate for its absence of humor with use of any legitimate drama. While the premise of a bereaved comedian dealing with the tragic death of a loved one had potential for drama and angst, the protagonist's \\"path to healing, though, is made Easy-Bake simple\\" by director David Wexler, whose use of father-finding-unhappy-son the perfect job where he then meets \\"perfect- match Veronica (Margarita Levieva)\\", then allows the protagonist of Zoe to become a \\"passive participant in his own healing, which Wexler leaves so uncomplicated that the story simply coasts along on a smooth path to happily ever after.\\" It was concluded, \\"regrettably, it‚Äôs impossible for the film or its star to do little more than recall other recent comedies and performers: the superior School of Rock for one and, via the portly Sollis‚Äôs eerily similar voice, Jonah Hill.\\" The Hollywood Reporter felt it was an \\"unconvincing indie effort\\" whose premise and role were more suitable as vehicles for Jack Black or Seth Rogen. In a project where a \\"depressed comedian becomes an unlikely kindergarten teacher\\", it was felt that despite its potential, \\"the film never manages to find a consistent footing, shifting uneasily in tone and haltingly proceeding with its formulaic plotting.\\" Further, for a stand-up comic, the character of Zoe Hardwick \\"proves to be remarkably unfunny, and Sollis lacks the necessary charisma to make us fully care about his undeveloped character.\\" And while praising Margarita Levieva as a highly appealing love interest, \\"she‚Äôs unable to overcome the sheer implausibility of her character‚Äôs falling in love with the charmless Zoe.\\" Praise went to Aidan Quinn's role as Zoe's father for giving \\"a drolly humorous performance that enlivens every scene in which he appears. While it‚Äôs hard to imagine how exactly this talented veteran actor wound up appearing in this low-budget affair, moviegoers are not likely to look a gift horse in the mouth.\\" The New York Times wrote that writer/director David Wexler was to be commended for taking viewers where might be expected in an \\"oaf-in-kiddieland story\\", but also offered it was \\"too bad that he didn‚Äôt bring a little more creativity to the predictable tale he does fashion\\". Granting that the film had Kindergarten Cop and School of Rock moments\\" and Jonathan Sollis having a physique similar to Jack Black, rather than being a comedy, \\"the focus soon shifts to finding Zoe a rebound romance. Conveniently, a good-looking fellow teacher (Margarita Levieva) is available. (For those keeping score, that‚Äôs two hot women inexplicably attracted to a moping schlump.)\\" It was offered that Levieva shows her range and \\"is quite watchable\\" but \\"Sollis can‚Äôt always handle the naturalistic acting style Mr. Wexler demands\\". It was concluded that \\"the main shortcoming of this film is that the story Mr. Wexler finally decides to tell is utterly ordinary.\\" Conversely, CultureMap Austin spoke toward the film's debut at the Austin Film Festival and offered that it might have been better named \\"The Kindergarten Teacher\\", as \\"stand up comedy bookends the film but doesn't really play an important symbolic or therapeutic role\\". It was felt that while the premise of a stand-up comic dealing with the death of a girlfriend by taking a job as a kindergarten teacher \\"sounds like something from a wacky Jonah Hill comedy,\\" the film managed to execute it \\"with restraint and complexity in a surprising way\\". It was also offered that Margarita Levieva's role of a fellow teacher and sympathetic new love interest allowed her to \\"elevate the character well out of Manic Pixie Dream Girl Territory\\".

While aeolian transport plays a role in the overall sedimentary budget for the coastal environment, it is paled in comparison to the fluvial supply which makes up 95% of sediment entering the ocean. When sediment reaches the coast it is then entrained by longshore drift and littoral cells until it is accreted upon the beach or dunes. While it is acknowledged that storm systems are the driver behind coastal erosion. There is a general consensus that human activity, mainly dam and reservoir impoundments on rivers are the cause of indirect human related coastal erosion, along with other local scale effects such as: land use change, irrigation, gravel extraction and river re-alignment.  Rate of supply  Worldwide, rivers discharge approximately 35x103 km3 of freshwater into the ocean annually. Transported in this freshwater is 15 to 20 x 109 tons of sediment. This sediment load is not proportionally distributed across the world's rivers, with Asian and Oceanic regions being among those most significantly affected by changing sediment regimes, as they account for 75% of this global sediment budget. These changing rates of supply/replenishment from the fluvial environment are a dominant factor in controlling the rate of coastal erosion. While sediment supply is actually increasing, due to increased erosion rates, the supply of this sediment to the coastal environment is decreasing.  Factors that influence sediment supply  Fluvial systems are key elements for operating Earth surface change because they convey most of the global fluxes of water and sediment from land to oceans. Human activities can affect the discharge of water and sediment from a river to the coastal environment in many ways. Deforestation and agriculture, as well as urbanization can increase the erosion of a river basin by as much as an order of magnitude. Freshly exposed soil is much less likely to resist erosion by rainfall or moving water, especially in areas where land is often used for agriculture and precipitation is high. Since the 1950s the number of dams in the world has increased more than sevenfold. The creation of reservoirs has significantly reduced the sediment yield of many rivers as sediment that was entrained in the flow is stopped by a manmade barrier and the energy required to transport the material is lost, the sediment is no longer entrained as there is no flow or the flow is too slow. Removal of water for irrigation reduces river flow and also plays its part in reducing the sediment carrying capacity of a river. Agricultural and farming practices often require intensive irrigation systems to achieve appropriate production levels. This creates a high demand on waterways as water is diverted and used to irrigate crops and pasture. This decreases the flow rate within the river system, which in turn lowers the sediment carrying capacity of the river as the energy within is less. Sediment is deposited along the reach of the river and takes much longer to reach the coastal zone if at all. Effects on the coast This changing coastal sediment supply regime leads to predominantly erosional outcomes but it is a case by case, river by river scenario. There are areas where the coastal sediment flux has increased and accretion of the shoreline has been evident. The effects of changing sediment flux can be very localised but pronounced, below are examples within the Bohai Sea. The Yellow River delta is undergoing an accretion phase while 200 km across the sea the Laun River area has experienced increased erosion rates along the coastline as a result of the changing sediment input. Accretion The Yellow River transports an order of magnitude more sediment than it did prior to widespread cultivation of the loess plateaus in northern China, about 2400 years ago. One implication of this large increase in the sediment discharge of Asian rivers has been the increased shoreward accretion of some deltaic areas over the past several millennia. The Yellow River Delta has accreted hundreds of square kilometers over the past few decades. Building the coastline at a rate greater than sea level rise and depositing sediment faster than erosional processes can remove it. Mankind in Asia is occupying land areas that may not have existed if not for the increased upstream erosion and delivery of the sediment to the coastal environment. Erosion Coastal erosion/retreat has wide- ranging implications for human habitat. With 45% of the world's population living within 100 km of a coastline. The decline of sediment supply to the coast generally results in increased rates of erosion as there is no nourishment of the beach profile. Over time as storm systems ‚Äòattack‚Äô the coastline removing sediment to offshore bars or from the system altogether a real issue develops in how to slow the advancing ocean and protect coastal developments. Qinhuangadao coast Since the completion of construction of two large dams on the Luan River in 1979, its annual sediment delivery to the Bohai Sea has been cut from 20.2 million tons to an annual sediment flux of only 1.9 million tons. This sharp reduction in sediment discharge has been accompanied by phase shift of the Luan River Delta into para-abandonment. This drop in sediment yield has inevitably altered the longshore transport equilibrium in the local coastal area. With prevailing northward winds, shoreline retreat rates north of the Luan River have increased from 1 m/y to 3.7 m/y over twenty-year period since dam construction, rapidly changing the morphology and beach profile via positive feedback until a new equilibrium was reached, at which the present retreat is back at its original 1 m/y. With a longshore drift equilibrium was reached within a new state. Mississippi Delta The effects of changing sediment flux were a definite compounding factor in the havoc brought upon New Orleans in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina. The Mississippi River Delta is slowly sinking due to natural compaction and its sediment supply from up river being greatly diminished by up to 50%, due to dam construction in the Mississippi Basin. The loss of sediment supply has resulted in subsidence of the delta and wetland reduction. Fresh sediment is not deposited at a rate fast enough for vegetation to grow on as sea level rises. The brackish conditions that are essential for vegetation growth on the delta are no longer. These coastal wetlands are vital for the diverse wildlife habitat that lives among them, and for protecting developed areas from storm surges, like the one experienced during Katrina. Solutions=Beach nourishment This is a short-term fix for a long-term problem. It treats the immediate symptoms of coastal erosion by dumping of sand either just off shore or on the berm itself, It can be a costly and time-consuming process as it requires upkeep on regular bases. While it may look aesthetically pleasing, it does not fix the problem at hand: the beach has lost its source of natural nourishment. Artificial nourishment is an appropriate short-term solution on small-scale restoration projects. Management Humans are simultaneously increasing the availability of sediment for fluvial transportation through activities and practices that increase soil erosion, and decreasing this flux to the coastal environment through retention of sediment behind reservoir walls and decreasing river discharge rates. The net result is a global reduction in the overall sediment flux. This impact on coastal erosion will be further accelerated as the sea level rises, which is anticipated because of climate change. Given the modern levels of fluvial sediment loads, over 100 billion tons of sediment have been sequestered behind human-made reservoirs. This gives reason for the effects of changes in the upstream fluvial environment to be included into the Integrated coastal zone management framework. Planners and decision makers must consider what the impacts of upstream development will have on the coastal environment. The management of the coastal zone must account for both the effect of human activities as well as the impacts resulting from corresponding changes in the coastal zone.

It is affiliated with Gloucestershire GAA and British GAA. The club provides exercise for the Irish (and wider) communities of Cardiff and the South Wales area and is always looking for new players of all levels and abilities. St Colmcilles was established in 1956 as a successor club to the Emmetts, which had ceased to operate in 1915 due to the First World War. St Colmcilles won the league in 1961 and a first county championship in 1967. They won the championship of Great Britain in 1973. However, in 1974, they ceased to operate, only to be revived (with new colours) for football at underage level in 1983. After this, a senior football team was put together, and, later, a camogie team for the ladies. St Colmcilles went on to win county league and championship at every grade, completed by the club's under-14 team winning the 1988 All-Britain. History The Emmets were the original GAA club that operated in the Cardiff in the early 1900s, but they folded in 1915 due mainly to the outbreak of the First World War. Following the demise of The Emmets, Cardiff went without a GAA club until 1956 when the current club St Colmcilles was founded. During this time the South Wales County Board collapsed and on the foundation of St Colmcilles in 1956 the club was aligned with the Gloucester County Board. It was initially set up as a hurling club and wore purple and gold, reflecting the large number of Wexford men in the side. At this time, so that both codes could flourish, there was an arrangement with near neighbours Newport's Pride of Erin that their footballers could hurl for Cardiff and the Cardiff footballers line out for Newport. St Colmcilles soon became a force to be reckoned with, winning the hurling league in 1961 and their first County Hurling Championship in 1967. This proved to be the first of five championships in six years. However, the club fell on hard times following that period of success and folded in 1976 mainly due to the lack of players. After nearly a decade of inactivity the club again sprang to life again in 1983, initially with underage football teams and a camogie side. A senior football was added as the club grew. It was at this reincarnation the club adopted their current colours of blue and white, following the trend set by the other major sporting clubs in the city. Success soon followed with a first senior football county title coming in 1989, a year after the under-14 team won the All Britain title in 1988 which remains the club's only top grade provincial title. Following this success the 1990s proved to be a barren decade, with years and inactivity and non- competitiveness. The late 1990s and early 2000s brought an influx of students who would become Cardiff stalwarts during the next decade. As a result, the club went through a golden period in the first decade of the 21st century. The current senior side have won seven of the last eleven Gloucestershire Senior Football Championships, including an historic four-in-a-row (2000, 2002, 2004, 2006‚Äì2009), as well as three from five Gloucestershire Senior Football League titles (2006, 2007, 2010). A renaissance in underage development occurred, with the under-14 footballers winning the British Provincial U14 Plate Championship in 2010. The underage membership of the club is increasing annually thanks to a number of club‚Äìschool links established in the Cardiff area. Also, the formation of a ladies' football team came about.

Early life Addai was born in Shaqlawa to a family of Chaldean Catholics on 3 March 1867. His father was the local priest of the village, and he helped him at teaching Assyrian language at a young age. The early death of his mother made him concentrate on ascetic life and he joined the Dominican Seminar in Mosul in 1880 where he studied Syriac, Chaldean, Arabic, French, Latin and Turkish as well as theology and philosophy. Nine years later he was appointed a priest and sent to his home town Shaqlawa, where he once more worked as a teacher in the Church's school. Priest and bishop He was later appointed as a bishopric assistant in Kirkuk and he spent his time learning Hebrew, Greek, Persian, Kurdish and he authored as well in German and English. On 13 November 1902, he was elected as the next bishop of Siirt, a position that had been vacant for two years. In 1908 he journeyed to Istanbul where he met the Ottoman Sultan Abdulhamid II. From there he took off to Rome and met pope Pius X, and during his stay in Paris he managed to make contacts with French orientalists and print some of his works. Death In 1915, the Ottoman Army was initially defeated in the Caucasus during the World War I, and fearing an internal uprising from its Christian population orders were given to exterminate the Armenian, Greek, and Assyrians population of Anatolia. Initially Addai Sher managed to bribe the governor of Siirt with 500 pounds of gold in order to save his congregation. This enabled some of the Chaldean Christians of the city to flee. The bishop himself was helped by a Kurdish Agha who hid him in his house. Some Kurds, subjects of Osman, Agha of Tanze, chief of the tribes Hadide and Atamissa, great friends of the Archbishop's and protectors of the Christians, disguised him as a Kurd and got him away by a secret door of his residence. For some days he remained with his friend the Kurdish Agha, but an Ottoman regiment learning of his flight, attempted to trace him. Knowing that the Kurd chief had concealed him they summoned him to surrender the Archbishop, set fire to his house, and threatened him with death. The Kurdish Agha fled with his family. The Kurds who remained, tired of the struggle, were obliged to indicate the hiding place of the prelate, whom the soldiers seized and killed with eight shots. The Archbishop remained hidden for several days, but eventually a band of Kurdish mercenaries who worked with the Ottoman Turkish army discovered his hideout.

It is native to Canada and the United States.  Description  An adult tadpole madtom is typically , however they have recorded at a length of . The tadpole madtom has a dark brown back with a lighter brown color on their sides and a yellow or white stomach. The pelvic and pectoral fins of adults are heavily covered in melanophores responsible for pigmentation, and the dorsal and anal fins contain fewer melanophores. There are also bands of melanophores on both the upper and lower jaws creating a dark horizontal streak along the side. Chin barbels vary from white to being lightly covered with melanophores. The tadpole madtom possess dark nasal and maxillary barbels and white mandibular barbels. Their adipose fin is completely connected to their large and round caudal fin,http://www.epa.gov/bioiweb1/html/fish_catfishes_genus.html and their pectoral fin is not serrated. They possess 6‚Äì7 gill rakers; 6‚Äì7 dorsal rays; 15‚Äì18 anal rays; 7‚Äì9 pectoral rays; and 8‚Äì10 pelvic rays. The anal fin is of moderate length, but decreases with increasing body length. The tadpole madtoms also possess two pectoral spines through which an anti-predatory venom is transmitted. They have a terminal mouth with numerous small and sharp cardiform teeth. The teeth exist in numerous broad bands across the upper and lower jaw.http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~tbonner/txfishes/noturus%20gyrinus.htm  Range and habitat  The tadpole madtom is found in parts of the U.S. and Canada. In Canada it is native to Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan, and can be found the Assiniboine, Saskatchewan, Souris, Red, English, Winnipeg, and Nelson rivers.http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/fish/fishred/tadmad.htm The tadpole madtom's range in the United States is extensive, ranging from Texas to Florida and north along the Atlantic coast to New York. It can be found in the Mississippi River valley as well as the Great Lakes basin. In Minnesota it is present in all adjacent drainage systems to the Red River basin. In North Dakota it can be found in the Missouri river drainage. In South Dakota it is present in the eastern tributaries to the Missouri River, including the James River, as well as the Minnesota and Big Sioux river drainages. The tadpole madtom lives in areas with little to no current. They typically inhabit swamps and marshes, as well as lakes and slow moving streams and rivers 0.1‚Äì1.5 meters deep and 12‚Äì24 meters wide. They also prefer habitats with turbid water; a soft mud, sand or gravel bottom; and thick vegetation to use for crypsis.  Diet  The tadpole madtom is an invertivore, planktivore, but also feeds on particulate. A Common food source for the tadpole madtom are immature insects such as cladocera, ostracods, hyalella, and chironomids. Another popular food source is small crustaceans such as amphipods and isopods. Smaller fish feed more on small crustaceans while large fish tend to consume large prey such as worms and grass shrimp. Researchers in Wisconsin recorded the stomach contents of numerous tadpole madtoms and found an average diet consisting of 44% insects, 28.3% small crustaceans, 18.3% oligochaetes, 5.9% plants, 3% silt and debris, 0.1% snails, and 0.1% algae.  Reproduction, life cycle  Due to the tadpole madtom's secretive nature, little is known of their spawning habits. In most areas the tadpole madtom spawn in June or July when the water temperature reaches 80 ¬∞F. Breeding males exhibit swelling of the lips and genital papillae as well as enlarged muscles on top of the head. Breeding tadpole madtoms do not build nests, but instead rely on any present solid substrate with which to attach their eggs. This generally includes things such as a rocks, logs, and vegetation. However, they have also been known to attach their eggs to submerged garbage such as pop cans. They have also been known to use abandoned crayfish burrows as a place to house their eggs. The female produces numerous clutches of eggs throughout breeding season, however not much is known of the number of clutches that they produce. Each clutch generally contains anywhere from 75 to 200 eggs. The male then guards the eggs until they hatch to ensure their safety.  Conservation status  Tadpole madtom populations are secure in most areas. However, they are critically endangered in Pennsylvania, and they are on Kansas's list of species in need of conservation. Populations in Saskatchewan, New York, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Iowa, and Nebraska are considered vulnerable as well.http://www.naturalheritage.state.pa.us/factsheets/11368.pdf  Etymology  The tom segment of the name is used as another word for cat. There are two explanations proposed for the reasoning behind the mad segment of the name. One is that it refers to the poisonous spines that it possesses; which maddens predators that get stuck by them. The alternative is that it refers to their habit of darting every which way when startled by predators. The tadpole segment of the name exists, because of their rounded caudal fin which gives them the appearance of a tadpole. Noturus (no-tour¬¥-us) means \\"back tail\\" in Greek, which refers to the strip of skin which connects the tail and adipose fins. Gyrinus (jie-wren¬¥-us) is Greek for tadpole.

Gender and Development for Cambodia reported in 2004 that \\"23% of women have suffered physical domestic abuse\\". Social status A young Cambodian waitress waiting on customers. Contrary to traditional Cambodian culture, young Cambodian women have been influenced by Western ways in recent years. One trend is that some young female Cambodians, particularly in the capital of Phnom Penh, overtly consume liquors and other alcoholic beverages in restaurants. Other perceived Western influences include the sense of having equal rights between men and women, a sense of peer pressure, companionship, experimentation, family troubles, abandonment by a boyfriend, and increasingly, advertising.Women in Cambodia are increasingly becoming social drinkers.

This bush-cricket is native to the British Isles where it may confused with the short-winged conehead (Conocephalus dorsalis). These two species are phenotypically similar; however, the distinguishing factor between the two is the fully developed set of wings the long-winged conehead possesses that allows for flight. In the short-winged coneheads the hind wings are shorter than the abdomen, causing the wings to be vestigial and the species is incapable of flight. For this reason it is hard to discriminate between the two species during the early stages of their life cycle before the wings have fully developed. The colouration of the conehead is typically a grass green with a distinctive brown stripe down its back, though there are some brown phenotypes. Scientific name Some authorities, following Roberts (1941), hold that this species should be referred to as Conocephalus discolor (Thunberg, 1815). The debate hinges on whether the specific epithet used by Fabricius in the combination Locusta fusca should be regarded as preoccupied by the naming of a species by Pallas in 1773 as \\"GRYLLUS Locusta fuscus\\" (this species is now known as Arcyptera fusca). Coray & Lehmann (1998) refute this on several grounds, most tellingly that Pallas and Fabricius are referring to two different nominal genera for which the name Locusta had been proposed - Pallas refers to Locusta Linnaeus, 1758 (type species the migratory locust), and Fabricius to Locusta Geoffroy, 1762 (type species the great green bush- cricket). The apparent homonymy is therefore to be disregardedICZN 57.8.1. \\"Homonymy between identical species-group names in combination (originally or subsequently) with homonymous generic names having the same spelling but established for different nominal genera [Art. 53.2] is to be disregarded.\\" and C. fuscus is the correct valid name. There are, however, still abundant references to C. discolor in modern literature, as well as to C. fuscus. Description The body of bush-crickets is covered by a protective exoskeleton and is divided into three parts: the head, thorax, and abdomen. The topmost segment of the thorax, the pronotum, is shaped like a saddle and is primarily used for protection. Bush-crickets are also equipped with large hind legs for jumping and biting mouth parts for grip and protection. The phenotypic aspects that are characteristic to this family of insects are the antennae, which typically exceed the length of their body, and the straight sword shaped ovipositor that the females use for laying eggs. The body of C. fuscus is when it reaches maturity. Its hind wings are longer than its forewings, and they both reach beyond the tip of the abdomen. A distinctive dorsal stripe runs down the thorax, covering its head and pronotum, which is long. Adults have a slender grass-green body, brown wings, brown ovipositor, a reddish-brown abdomen, and a dark-brown stripe that edges white near the thorax. Nymphs differ slightly in colouration with a light-green body and a white-margined black stripe. C. fuscus is a wing polymorphic species. Most wing-dimorphic tettigoniids have a brachypterous (short-winged) form and a macropterous (long-winged) form. However, since C. fuscus is already considered a long winged species, its alternative form is extra long winged, with wing lengths up to a third longer than normal individuals. An experiment performed by Ando and Hartley in 1982 on the embryonic development of this species provided evidence that the tendency for an individual to develop as one wing morph or the other is dependent on the density of the population. In this species the development of individuals with extra long wings is induced by crowding. Wing dimorphism does not only affect wing length, but also affects flight, dispersal, and reproductive capability of this species. The juvenile hormone is responsible for wing polymorphism in orthoptera and has also been known to play a role in the trade-off between wing morphology and reproductive capability. Distribution and habitat C. fuscus can be found in parts of France, Italy, and the Netherlands, but it has made is biggest appearance in the United Kingdom. When the species was first discovered in Britain in the 1940s it was confined to the South Coast but in the 1980s there was dramatic population growth and its range expanded more than 150 miles in 20 years. Today the long-winged conehead can be found in northwestern parts of the country beyond the River Thames and as far west as Wales. The increase in the global climate over the past few decades has had a significant impact on the spread of this species. The northward range expansion coincides with the worldwide increase in temperature due to the greenhouse effect. Universally, species respond to fluctuations in climate by increasing or contracting their breeding ranges. If the opportunity arises for a species to expand its realised niche due to favourable conditions that have become available, it is advantageous for them to do so. In the 1950s the climate began to cool in the northern hemisphere, causing longer winters in southern Europe. This kept the long-winged coneheads in the southern part of the UK, where they were first sited, for a period of time. In 1975 the effects of the greenhouse gases began to neutralise the cooling effects from the previous decades, and as the climate in the United Kingdom slowly rose, the long-winged coneheads started to increase the limits of their range farther northward. However, the major expansion did not occur until 1980 when global warming caused a significant increase in temperature in the northern hemisphere. Since 1980 the temperature has risen linearly by ¬± per decade and the greatest impact fell between 40¬∞N and 70¬∞N latitude. This latitudinal region includes the United Kingdom and southern Europe, which explains why the long-wing conehead, and other European fauna, has responded most readily to the warming climate and expanded its range. Another factor propagating this expansion is the presence of extra long-winged individuals within the species. The populations found farther north, at the range borders, have a higher percentage of extra long-winged (macropterous) individuals in comparison to populations in range core. Ando and Hartley (1982) found the macropters to be more active and capable of sustained flight. The long-winged individuals would engage flight for short periods of time if disturbed but would more readily seek cover. Simmons and Thomas (2004) also found that there was a difference in flight capability between the range populations. Individuals in border populations were able to fly up to four times longer ( ¬± ) than those in the core ( ¬± ). This suggests that there may be genetic differences between the two range populations and that the effect density on the formation of one phenotype or another is a plastic response; however, this evidence is not definitive. It is clear that macropterous individuals have a selective advantage due to their capability for sustained flight, allowing them to form new colonies and benefit from habitats that have opened up farther north. This expansion is beneficial for the species as well as the individuals within the species. As the species expands its range as a whole the individuals can take advantage of the unclaimed territory, which previously had an unsuitable climate. The individuals that now inhabit the area do not have to compete for resources such as food and shelter, and therefore can put more time and energy into ensuring the reproductive success of their offspring and the prorogation of their own genes. This is especially beneficial for the extra long-winged individuals who experience a reproductive trade off with wing morphology. Conocephalus fuscus shares the same habitat as many species of bush-crickets. It makes its home in grassy meadows, woodlands, dry heaths, and among course vegetation. They can also be found living near water in reed beds, marshes, or bogs. This species prefers areas with a warm climate, as evident by their recent northern dispersal due to the increase in global climate. Feeding This species is omnivorous, though its diet is mostly vegetarian. The long- winged conehead feeds primarily on grasses as well as small invertebrates such as aphids and caterpillars. Behaviour and reproduction Conocephalus fuscus is active during the day, and their main form of locomotion is walking. However, they use their large hind legs for jumping when under threat of predation. Song The males in this species stridulate, rubbing their forewings over each other, creating enough friction to produce a \\"song\\". This song, also known as a calling song, is the male's way of attracting conspecific females to mate with. The song of the long-winged can be heard between frequencies of 8 kHz to 19 kHz and from a distance of from the source. The song consists of trisyllabic echeme, a first-order assemblage of syllables, each with a short opening hemisyllable followed by a longer closing hemisyllable. The hemisyllables are the sounds produced by the upward (opening) and downward (closing) stroke of the forewings. The first two syllables are between 15 ms and 16 ms while the third lasts about 25 ms while the opening hemisyllable of the first syllable is very strong and distinctive and that of the third syllable is quiet and soft. These different aspects come together to make a distinct song that can overall be described as a soft sizzling sound. Like many behaviours, there are costs and benefits to the calling song. Mating calls are beneficial to the individuals because their song attracts females that they can potentially mate with. However, songs can also signal predators and alert them of the male's presence and presents a risk to his life. Though male stridulation can lead to death, long-winged conehead males continue to produce their song because the benefits of attracting a female outweigh the costs of being eaten. It is within the individuals best interest to maximise his reproductive success, including his ability to find a mate, and therefore this mating behaviour within the species. Life cycle Conocephalus fuscus has a univoltine life cycle, only producing one set of offspring per year. The females lay between their eggs in the stems of grasses in the late summer. They do this by first biting a whole into the stems of grasses or reeds and then insert their eggs using their ovipositors. The eggs develop over the winter months and the nymphs will begin to emerge in mid May and will reach adulthood between July and late October. Experiments by Ando and Hartley (1982) and Simmons and Thomas (2004) show that there is a trade-off between wing morphology and reproductive ability. The macropterous individuals have an overall lower fecundity, or fertility, than the long-winged individuals. The length of a female depends on the extent of abdominal swelling due to the amount of eggs the individual is holding. The macropterous females were shorter in length than the long-winged morphs and therefore do not carry as many eggs. The number of eggs within the ovaries is the same between the two phenotypes; however, the number of eggs in production at any given time is significantly lower in extra long-winged individuals. Lowered fecundity in macropterous females is largely due to the fact that the pre-oviposition, the period between the emergence of an adult female and the start of her egg laying period, for these individuals is more than twice that of the long-winged morphs. Another cause is the lower oviposition rate that emacropterous females experience during the first half of the egg-laying period which never allows them to catch up to the normal egg laying rate. The delay in maturation and lower egg production reduces the amount of extra weight on the insect allowing it to be capable of longer flight. The dispersal and flight capability of macropterous individuals provides them with an increased chance of finding a new habitat and colonising a new territory, at the cost of reproductive ability. However this cost does not outweigh the benefit of relocating to an area that has plenty of space and resources. Therefore, more changes in distribution can be anticipated if the global climate continues to rise and areas farther north become suitable habitats for C. fuscus.

He was a Member of Parliament in the 41st Parliament. He was elected to the House of Commons in the 2011 federal election and represented the electoral district of Surrey North for the New Democratic Party. He has served as the Official Opposition's critic on Public Safety and for the Asia-Pacific Gateway project. As a child, Sandhu immigrated to Canada where he completed high school and graduated from Simon Fraser University and Royal Roads University with a MBA. He worked at the Justice Institute of British Columbia as a program coordinator. He helped operate a program which provided training and testing of taxi drivers in Metro Vancouver. Sandhu was the spokesperson for the Professor Mohan Singh Memorial Foundation which advocated for an apology from the federal government over its actions during the Komagata Maru incident. Background As a child, Jasbir, with his family, emigrated to Canada from Punjab, India, where he was born. He lived in Surrey and graduated from Queen Elizabeth Secondary School. He and his family consists of small business owners and restaurateurs. He attended Simon Fraser University where he graduated with a bachelor's degree, and then Royal Roads University where he received a Master's of Business Administration. Beginning in the mid-1990s Sandhu began working as an instructor and program coordinator at the Justice Institute. Under the province's SuperHost program, the City of Vancouver initiated a new permitting system, put into effect in 1997, for taxi drivers at the Justice Institute. Sandhu became the program manager of this program called TaxiHost, mandatory for all taxi drivers, in which drivers had to pass a written multiple-choice exam on topics such as defensive driving, customer service, local geography, and basic English. While the program had a high failure rate initially, it produced favourable results and was extended over Metro Vancouver and formed the basis for a similar system in Calgary. Sandhu was active in the community, volunteering at the United Way for one campaign and served a term as a board member at Vancity Community Foundation. He also served as the spokesperson for the Prof Mohan Singh Memorial Foundation which lobbied for an apology from the federal government for the 1914 Komagata Maru incident. Prime Minister Stephen Harper delivered the apology in August 2008 at a community gathering at Bear Creek in Surrey. Sandhu and the group believed it would be accompanied by an apology in the House of Commons. After expressing disappointment in the limited apology and the lack of acknowledgement in the House of Commons, the government representatives accused Sandhu and the group of engaging in \\"dirty politics\\". Politics With a snap election expected, the NDP nominated Sandhu as their candidate in the Surrey North riding. While he was nominated in September 2009, the general election was eventually scheduled for May 2011. As the election approached, it became apparent the Surrey North race would be a close race between Sandhu and the incumbent MP Dona Cadman of the Conservative Party. With Cadman being criticized for not voting on an HST bill and for being largely absent from the public view, Sandhu became the favourite to win. In the May 2 vote, Sandhu defeated Cadman and five other candidates to win the riding with 40% of the vote. In the 41st Parliament, with Sandhu's New Democratic Party forming the official opposition, party leader Jack Layton appointed him as critic for public safety. As such Sandhu spoke out against the costs of the Conservative government's crime bills which involved minimum sentencing, internet surveillance, and opening large new penal facilities. Sandhu hosted a public forum at the Surrey campus of SFU concerning public safety and crime issues. He sat on three standing committees: Public Safety and National Security, Justice and Human Rights, and International Trade. During the NDP leadership election, he endorsed Brian Topp. After Thomas Mulcair won, Sandhu was moved to the role of critic on Asia-Pacific Gateway project, effective April 2012.

According to a research by Mediobanca, Banca Sella Group was ranked the 20th largest bank in Italy by total assets as of 31 December 2016. History=Origins of Banca Sella The story of Gruppo Banca Sella has its roots in 1886, when Gaudenzio Sella, inspired by the principles of his uncle Quintino Sella, along with six other brothers and cousins, founded in Biella the Gaudenzio Sella & C., (the current Banca Sella Group), in order to \\"carry on trade as the banking discounts, advances, current accounts, buying and selling of securities, etc. \\", as shown in the deed. The senior managers of the bank was newly appointed Gaudenzio Sella, who remained at the helm of the institute until his death. Expansion The first branches outside of Biella date back to the late '30s (Ponzone, Trivero, Cossato). In 1949 the bank changed its name becoming a Societ√† per azioni (limited company) and the brothers Ernesto and Giorgio Sella respectively assumed the position of chairman and CEO. In 1962 changed its name to Banca Sella S.p.A. In 1974, the death of Ernesto, Giorgio Sella became the Chairman; Chief Executive Officer was entrusted to Maurizio Sella, son of Ernesto. Under the leadership of Maurizio Sella, Banca Sella spread throughout the country up to more than 300 branches in the first decade of 2000 . Over the years the Bank has acquired small local institutions in the North East and South Italy, and have been established operating companies in various businesses such as leasing, consumer finance, asset management companies, non-life insurance. In 1992 Gruppo Banca Sella was found. In 1997 it takes place the launch of internet banking services and in 2000 the brand . On the death of Giorgio Sella (in 2000) Maurizio Sella became the chairman, while Pietro Sella (born in 1968) he became the CEO in 2002.

Birth of Banca Sella Holding and recent history As part of a restructuring of the group, on 1 January 2006 the [old] Banca Sella S.p.A. (P.IVA 01709430027) was transformed into a financial holding company of the group and changed its name to Sella Holding Banca S.p.A., having conferred the banking business to a new subsidiary that it has taken so the name of [new] Banca Sella S.p.A. (P.I. 02224410023). On 1 April 2006 from the merger of Fiduciaria Sella S.I.M.p.A.

In October 2006, for the acquisition of eight branches that Banca Sella held in the region of Veneto, Banca Bovio Calderari (a indirect subsidiary of the group via Bovio Calderari Finanziaria S.p.A.) assumes the new name of Banca Sella Nord Est Bovio Calderari (Sella North East ‚Äì Bovio Calderari Bank). After the deals the group owned 80.03% shares of Bovio Calderari Finanziaria (BC Finanziaria), BC Finanziaria had a controlling interests in the new bank. On 1 June 2007 Sella Gestioni SGR formed a new subsidiary Sella Capital Management SGR who was in charge of asset management for institutional clients. On 12 November 2007 Banca Patrimoni Sella & C. was formed by the merger by absorption of Sella Consult S.I.M.p.A. into Banca Patrimoni e Investimenti; after the transaction the group owned 68.190% shares of the subsidiary, increasing from 56.114%. In 2007 CBA Vita, a subsidiary of the group, with HDI Assicurazioni, creates InChiaro, a joint venture dedicated to bancassurance (insurance services that integrated with bank); in 2016 all shares held by Banca Sella Group in CBA Vita have been sold to HDI Assicurazioni. On 31 March 2008, \\"Sella Holding Banca\\" changed its name to Banca Sella Holding S.p.A..

The spill was caused by rain then damaging the pipes in the Rainbow Pipeline system, owned by Plains Midstream Canada, a unit of Plains All American Pipeline. It was the largest oil spill in Alberta in 36 years.Welsch, E. (May 5, 2011). \\"Size of Oil Spill in Canada Grows.\\" Wall Street Journal.Vanderklippe, N. (May 4, 2011). \\"Costs for oil companies pile up after spill.\\" The Globe and Mail. The local school was closed following the oil spill due to concerns about the effects of fumes.The Globe and Mail (May 4, 2011). Location of oil spill near Little Buffalo, Alta. The 44-year-old Rainbow Pipeline carries an average of 187,000 barrels a day from Zama, Alberta to Edmonton. Little Buffalo, a Lubicon Cree community of about 350 people, is approximately ten kilometres from the spill site. Local news reports stated that many of the 125 children attending the local school began complaining of headaches, dizziness and nausea around 9:30 a.m. on April 29. The school was closed for the day on the day of the spill (Friday), but was evacuated again the following Monday due to the odour and effects on the children.Steele, E. (May 6, 2011). Large crude oil spill near Little Buffalo . Peace River Record Gazette. In 2013, Alberta's Energy Resource Conservation Board (ERCB) issued a reprimand to Plains Mainstream for operational failures in connection with the oil spill.CBC News (February 26, 2013). Plains Midstream reprimanded for 2011 Alberta oil spill. Retrieved on: 2013-02-27. Response School principal Brian Alexander and chief Steve Noskey of the Lubicon Cree First Nation both expressed concern about the lack of response or information from the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) in the week following the spill. Provincial Environment Minister Rob Renner told reporters that the spill is in a \\"very remote area,\\" and though a large spill, was under control. Renner said he was unaware of potential impacts on humans. Although he did not discount the community's health concerns, he said it was unlikely that the odours would carry dangerous chemicals. According to Alberta Environment spokesman Trevor Gemmell, the spill was contained in stands of stagnant water and was 300 metres from any flowing water. Within two weeks, the company had cleaned up about 33 per cent of the oil, the oil pooled on top of the open water. However, it was estimated that it would take six months to recover most of the oil, including that which had soaked into the vegetation. Everyone involved admitted that restoring it fully was out of the question. The ERCB is the agency responsible for determining the cause of the leak. According to technician Sandra Blais that means analyzing the age of the pipeline. The pipeline had a spill in 2006 and the Alberta energy regulator determined that it was caused by corrosion. The pipeline has carried diluted bitumen, the oil sands product claimed by environmentalists claim to be harder on pipes than conventional oil. This is denied by industry officials.Wingrove, J. (August 24, 2012). A dire warning from a broken pipe. The Globe and Mail. Retrieved on: 2013-02-22. Issues According to a report in The Globe and Mail, four things went wrong in the Rainbow spill: Underlying cause In 2010, after company monitoring flagged a problem, the line was dug up and repaired. However, when the pipe was replaced, the soil beneath it was insufficient and over the next year, the line sagged and eventually broke. Fixes of this nature are considered minor and are not monitored by regulators Delays in detecting break According to the company, the break probably happened around 7:00 p.m. on April 28. Operators attempted several restarts before the pressure dropped early Friday morning. Due to the location in a remote area only accessible by helicopter at the time, the break was not confirmed until twelve hours later, just after dawn Friday. By then, thousands of barrels had poured into the muskeg. According to Reg Eadie, an engineering professor and pipeline expert at the University of Alberta, that delay is among the most troubling parts of the spill. Initial response inadequate With an estimated 28,000 barrels spilled, it was Alberta's largest spill since the mid-1970s. However, for four days, provincial officials said the spill was only several hundred barrels. It was not until May 3, a day after the federal election, that the province admitted it was 45 times larger. Premier Ed Stelmach admitted that the initial response was slow and pledged to hold the company's \\"feet to the fire.\\" Lack of communication Little Buffalo has a school whose students and staff make up more than a third of the community's population. Although the spill happened on a Thursday, the school was not formally advised about the spill until the following Tuesday. Meanwhile, children complained of nausea and headaches on Friday, Monday and Tuesday. Locals say that the lack of urgency was likely due to the low initial estimates of the size of the spill. Investigation report On February 26, 2013 Alberta's Energy Resource Conservation Board issued four high-risk enforcement actions against the pipeline owner, Calgary-based Plains Mainstream. The investigation by the ERCB revealed operational failures by the company, including inadequate leak detection and emergency response. Plains Mainstream will be required to engage a third-party audit of its ability to manage communications during a crisis. The company was also responsible for a spill near Sundre, Alberta in 2012.Canadian Press (February 26, 2013). Plains Midstream Canada Oil Spill: Alberta Regulator Slams Company. Huffington Post Retrieved on: 2013-02-27. An ERCB high-risk enforcement action indicates that the incident has both public safety and environmental impacts. It is the most serious offence companies can be found in non-compliance with. According to the ERCB, the pipeline was shut down for 122 days. \\"This spill was one of the largest we've seen in Alberta... We wanted to make sure the message was sent to Plains and we're hoping beyond Plains all of the pipeline industry sees how seriously we're taking this and how seriously we will be taking this going forward.\\" The company responded in a press release: \\"Plains is carefully reviewing the ERCB's investigation report to determine whether any further findings and improvements can be applied to our operations. We have finalized the results of our own detailed investigation and have applied those lessons learned to improve our overall operations.\\" However, Greenpeace Canada said that the ERCB should have taken stronger action with Plains Midstream.\\"The Energy Resources Conservation Board's report is a damning indictment of pipeline safety in Alberta as yet another pipeline company has failed to protect Alberta's environment and people and only received the lightest slap on the wrist,\\" said Greenpeace Climate and Energy Campaigner Melina Laboucan- Massimo. Charges On April 26, 2013 Plains Midstream Canada was charged with three counts of violating environmental protection laws relating to the spill. The charges pertain to: \\"the spill itself, failing to take all reasonable measures to repair the problem and not pursuing all steps possible to remediate and dispose of the oil that contaminated over three hectares of beaver ponds and muskeg in a densely forested area.\\"McClure, M.

Biography Einsatzgruppe IV execution of Polish hostages at the Bydgoszcz town square on 9 September 1939 Born in Leipzig in 1902, Beutel served as a volunteer in the Infantery Regiments 11 and 38 from 1921 to 1923 while studying pharmacy, economy and art history, finishing his degree in Chemnitz, Saxony. Beutel originally joined the 'Orgesch' (from 'Organisation Escherich), an anti- Semitic paramilitary group, and, later, the Nazi Party in June 1929. In May 1930 he joined the Schutzstaffel, the SS. From 1933 to 1938 he was in charge of the Sicherheitsdienst for south east Germany, based in Leipzig. At the same time, since 1933, he was also the assistant Reichsapothekerf√ºhrer, the head of the national Nazi-controlled association of pharmacists. Beutel was involved in the Night of the Long Knives, the purge of the SA, leading a death squad in Saxony. From 1937 to 1939 Beutel commanded the Bavarian branch of the Gestapo. He was drafted to the Waffen-SS on 28 August 1939, during the Nazi invasion of Poland, then the SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Beutel commanded Einsatzgruppe IV. In this position Beutel organised the initial capture of Warsaw's Jewish population and set in motion their ghettoization.Dan Michman, The Emergence of Jewish Ghettos During the Holocaust, Cambridge University Press, 2011, pp. 75-76 Beutel was also active in Bydgoszcz where he personally ordered a number of mass shootings including the murder of around 120-150 Poles taken to nearby woods and shot on 11 and 12 September 1939.Jochen B√∂hler, Klaus-Michael Mallmann, J√ºrgen Matth√§us: Einsatzgruppen w Polsce (\\"Einsatzgruppen in Poland\\"), Bellona, Warszawa 2009, pp. 80, 141 This figure is given as 900 by another source.Michael Mueller, Geoffrey Brooks, Canaris: the life and death of Hitler's spymaster, Naval Institute Press, 2007, p. 163 Criminal police (Kripo) commander Arthur Nebe ordered that Beutel, who quickly became noted for his corruption, be investigated for the rape of a Polish girl whose mother cooked for the SS.Mario R.

He was demoted in rank in October 1939 and lost his SS membership. He subsequently served in a penal unit of the SS-Totenkopfdivision in France before returning to civilian life, working as a pharmacist again. Beutel was once more drafted into the Waffen-SS in 1944 and wounded and captured by Soviet forces in Hungary. Beutel spent the next ten years as a prisoner of war, before being released in October 1955. He returned to his profession of pharmacist, now living in West Berlin. Beutel was arrested in May 1965, tried but released in 1971 because of a lack of evidence. He died in West Berlin in 1986.

It was opened on 28 November 1872 and located in the village Snarum. The station building was designed by Georg Andreas Bull in Swiss chalet style. On 26 November 1872, farmer J√∏rgen Rytterager was appointed the first station master of the station. The station was one of the stations on the Kr√∏der Line with the most passenger and freight traffic. Passenger service was ceased on 19 January 1958, and freight traffic on 1 March 1985. History The Kr√∏der Line was opened on 28 November 1872 as a branch line from the Randsfjord Line. It was originally constructed as a narrow gauge line, but converted into standard gauge in 1909. On 14 March 1872, farmer J√∏rgen Rytterager (1809‚Äì1899) sent a letter to the operation manager of the Randsfjord Line, in which he applied for the station master position at the future Snarum Station. On 28 September the same year, the operation manager replied Rytterager in a letter, in which he granted him the position. A meeting was held on 26 November, where Rytterager officially was appointed station master of Snarum Station. A porter and a telegraph apprentice were also employed at the station on the same date. The station was opened two days later under the name Lofthus, but had its name changed to Snarum at some point in 1873. Rytterager retired from his positions at the station on 1 December 1882, at the age of 73 years, and later died on 17 March 1899. He was succeeded by Olaus Str√∏m, who served as station master until 1893. At some point around 1900, a dairy was established at Snarum, which frequently used the station to transport milk and butter. A cement factory was started in 1919, and by 1930 there were three village shops in Snarum. This made the station one of the most frequently used stations on the Kr√∏der Line. Snarum Station was formally degraded from a station to a halt on 1 August 1957. On 19 January 1958, passenger traffic on the Kr√∏der Line was stopped and replaced with bus traffic. The line was thereafter only used for freight traffic, which ceased on 1 March 1985. In 1986, the Kr√∏der Line Foundation () was established, which owns and maintains the track and the stations on the Kr√∏der Line, and also operates heritage trains on Sundays. Facilities The station house was designed by Georg Andreas Bull in Swiss chalet style. On 1 November 1873, a post office was opened at the station, with Rytterager as post opener. Since 20 March of the same year, it had been possible to send telegraphs from the station. The station building burned down in 1992, but was reconstructed after old plan drawings and finished in 1997, the year of the 125th anniversary of the Kr√∏der Line.

It is one of the highest grossing non-musical documentaries in United States history.Hoop Dreams at The Internet Movie Database Career Frederick Marx is a producer, director, writer, and editor with 35 years in the film business, most of them as an independent filmmaker. Having worked for a time as an English and creative writing teacher, Marx began his movie career as a film critic, and has worked both as a film distributor and exhibitor. He has also traveled extensively. He's lived in Germany, China, and Hungary. He's traveled repeatedly through Western and Eastern Europe, North Africa and Himalayan India. Marx graduated from the University of Illinois Laboratory High School in Urbana, Illinois in 1973. With a B.A. in Political Science and an MFA in filmmaking from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, Marx has coupled his formal education with a natural gift for languages, speaking German and some Mandarin-Chinese. His interest in languages and foreign cultures is reflected in PBS' international human rights program Out of the Silence (1991), the widely acclaimed personal essay Dreams from China (1989), and Learning Channel's Saving the Sphinx (1997). He consulted on Iranian- Kurdish director Bahman Ghobadi's feature Turtles Can Fly (2004) and was a teacher of renowned Thai feature filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul.Apichatpong Weerasethakul at The Internet Movie Database In 1993, Marx received an Emmy nomination for Higher Goals (1992) for Best Daytime Children's Special.Higher Goals (1992) at The Internet Movie Database Producer, Director, and Writer for this national PBS Special, Marx directed Tim Meadows of Saturday Night Live fame. Accompanied by a curriculum guide, the program was later distributed for free to over 4,200 inner city schools nationwide. The Unspoken (1999), Marx's first feature film, features performances from Russian star Sergei Shnirev of the famed Moscow Art Theatre, and Harry Lennix, most known for Get on the Bus, Bob Roberts, Titus, ER, and The Matrix. Three of Marx's films premiered at the New York Film Festival. Having dedicated his life to the making and promotion of independent films, Marx repeatedly returns to work with disadvantaged and misunderstood communities: people of color, abused children, the working poor, welfare recipients, prisoners, the elderly, \\"at risk\\" youth, and American Veterans. His films show a passion for appreciating multiculturalism and an urgent empathy for the sufferings of the disadvantaged to every subject he tackles. Hoop Dreams (1994) is the film that first interested Marx in the welfare of teenage boys. Boys to Men? (2004), distributed by Media Education Foundation, takes that as its central theme. Boys Become Men, now in production, is the sequel, pinpointing initiation and mentorship as the solutions to the problems teen boys face. A hobbyist songwriter, in 1991 Marx recorded a number of his songs collectively known as Rolling Steel. Two of those 11 songs are used over The Unspoken (1999) tail credits and one is used in Boys to Men. Hoop Dreams (1994) Frederick Marx's film Hoop Dreams played in hundreds of theatres nationwide after winning the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festivallist of 1994 Sundance Film Festival Awards and was the first documentary ever chosen to close the New York Film Festival.review for Hoop Dreams from New York Times, 1994 It was on over 100 \\"Ten Best\\" lists nationwide and was named Best Film of the Year by Roger Ebert.Ebert's 10 Best Lists: 1967-present.

Kennedy Special Achievement Award. Though Marx was nominated for editing Hoop Dreams by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Oscars), the film itself was never nominated as Best Film or Best Documentary, which caused something of a scandal and led the Academy to rewrite its nominating procedures. Journey From Zanskar (2010) Journey From Zanskar tells the emotional story of 17 small children who leave home and family, possibly forever, in order to save their dying Tibetan culture. Parting from one of the most remote and desolate places on Earth ‚Äì Zanskar, in northwest India ‚Äì the expedition must travel on foot over 17,000 foot Himalayan passes. The two monks serving as guides walked this same path 30 years ago when they were children. Written, produced, and directed by Frederick Marx, narrated by Richard Gere, featuring the Dalai Lama, the film tells the story of their incredible journey. Distributed in France by Jupiter films, Frederick Marx is currently self-distributing Journey From Zanskar in the United States through his non-profit company Warrior Films. Rites of Passage - short film (2015) An estimated $500 billion is spent yearly on teen dysfunctions: drug and alcohol abuse, teen pregnancy and STDs, school dropouts and expulsions, gang and property crimes, traffic accidents, ADD, ADHD, depression and violence.http://musings.lifeplaninstitute.org/2009_04_01_archive.html Teenagers unconsciously push up against the confines of their own bodies, the rules of parents and society, and the capacity of their own minds and willpower to discover the true limits of their potential. The film explains how they need to be initiated into adulthood and the social benefits that will accrue. Rites of Passage - the feature (in production) The film will show us how historically all major cultures and religions have had their own rites of passage. The film will show us the price we pay as a society for not initiating our teens. Communities are answering the call by co-creating their own functional rites of passage today. We will see real families who‚Äôve been struck by the horrors and crimes of youth and how they‚Äôre repairing themselves and their neighborhoods. Finally, it will not only show us teens themselves who‚Äôve been transformed by rites of passage, but how their metamorphosis has revolutionized their relations with family and friends, teachers and bosses, creating positive changes rippling across homes, schools, neighborhoods, workplaces, cities and farms across the planet. Veterans Journey Home (in Production) American Veterans struggle to transition back to civilian life with PTSD, addiction, unemployment, domestic violence, homelessness, and suicide rates much higher than the general population.http://www.veteransandptsd.com/PTSD-statistics.html Focused on the daily struggles faced by men and women returning from combat, this documentary aims to help average citizens, veterans, and their families understand the multiple non-pathologizing, drug free healing modalities available that offer Veterans support and compassion. The film aims to highlight the best people, practices, and programs doing the necessary work sometimes referred to as \\"Reverse Boot Camp.\\"https://stopsoldiersuicide.org/reason-1-president-said/ At Death Do Us Part (2018) Marx shares the history, depth and the power of his relationship with his wife Tracy Seeley (who had breast cancer when they met), the journey they traveled together to her ultimate death, and his subsequent odyssey through the grief. He reflects on how his lifelong study of Buddhism (up to and including his being ordained as a Rinzai Zen Priest in the Hollow Bones Order),http://www.mondozen.org/community/people/priests.htm his work with the ManKind Projecthttps://mankindproject.org/ and his studies in mature masculinity,http://jungchicago.org/store/index.php?route=product/product&product;_id=67 and his Rites of Passage work,https://warriorfilms.org/rites-of-passage/world- wisdom-library/ all helped pull him through.  Rites to a Good Life: Everyday Rituals for Healing and Transformation (2020)  All our passages through a normal human life span deserve attention and ritual. Marx's latest book describes how we can do it simply, without great fuss, with minimal disruption to our normal lives, and without the need for priests, ministers, or gurus. This is not a religious book. All beliefs and non-beliefs are welcome. Written in a no-nonsense style, this handbook offers many real-world ideas about how people can change to live a fulfilled daily life. Each chapter ends with a bullet-point list on \\"What You Can Do Now.\\" Readers will leave with practical suggestions for living a more meaningful life each and every moment. Interspersed throughout are anecdotes and reflections from a multi- cultural assembly of some of the most well-respected minds in human transformation: Robert Bly, Michael Meade, Meredith Little, Starhawk, Orland Bishop, Robert Moore, Bill Plotkin, Clarissa Pinkola-Estes, Angeles Arrien, Richard Louv.

Only one copy of the data is sent from the source, and multiple copies are created and then sent to the desired recipient by the network infrastructure nodes. In for example IP multicast, a multicast group is identified by a class D IP address. A host enters or exits a group using IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol). A message sent via multicast is sent to all nodes on the network, but only the intended nodes accept the multicast frames.Pessi, Pekka. Department of Computer Science, Helsinki University Of Technology. ‚ÄúSecure Multicast‚Äù. Multicasting is useful in situations such as video conferencing and online gaming. Multicast was used originally in LANs, with Ethernet being the best example. A problem with multicast communication is that it is difficult to guarantee that only designated receivers receive the data being sent. This is largely because multicast groups are always changing; users come and go at any time. A solution to the problem of ensuring that only the chosen recipient obtains the data is known as multicast encryption. ISO Standards The ISO (International Organization for Standardization) states that confidentiality, integrity, authentication, access control, and non-repudiation should all be considered when creating any secure system. * Confidentiality: No unauthorized party can access appropriate messages. * Integrity: Messages cannot be changed during transit without being discovered. * Authentication: The message needs to be sent by the person/machine who claims to have sent it. * Access control: Only those users enabled can access the data. * Non-repudiation: The receiver can prove that the sender actually sent the message. To be secure, members who are just being added to the group must be restricted from viewing past data. Also, members removed from a group may not access future data.Pannetrat, Alain and Refik Molva. ‚ÄúMultiple Layer Encryption for Multicast Groups‚Äù. Theories One theory for the creation of an encryption protocol explains that ideally, each member of a group should have a key which changes upon the entrance or exit of a member of the group. Another theory suggests a primary key subsidized by additional keys belonging to legitimate group members. One protocol called UFTP (encrypted UDP based FTP over multicast) was created in an attempt to solve this problem. The protocol is designed in three phases: announce/register, file transfer, and completion/confirmation. The latest version 4.9.5 was released on 12/16/2017 and the source code is available in the website.‚ÄúUFTP ‚Äì Encrypted UDP based FTP with multicast‚Äù Current alternatives Today, one alternative in multicast encryption involves the use of symmetric key encryption where data is decoded by intended receivers using a traffic encryption key (TEK). The TEK is changed any time a member joins or leaves the group. This is not feasible for large groups. Users must be continuously connected to obtain the new keys. Another more common method involves asymmetric keys. Here, a private key is shared and those shares are given out asymmetrically. The initial member is given a number of shares, one of which is passed to each group member. If a member has a valid share of the key, he can view the message.Duan, Yitao and John Canny.

City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775 (1998), is a US labor law case of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court identified the circumstances under which an employer may be held liable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for the acts of a supervisory employee whose sexual harassment of subordinates has created a hostile work environment amounting to employment discrimination. The court held that \\"an employer is vicariously liable for actionable discrimination caused by a supervisor, but subject to an affirmative defense looking to the reasonableness of the employer's conduct as well as that of a plaintiff victim.\\". Facts The case centered around a lifeguard resigning her position. In 1992, Beth Ann Faragher brought to the city's attention that her supervisors, Bill Terry and David Silverman, had created a \\"sexually hostile atmosphere\\" at work and there was constant offensive touching which was not invited. The two supervisors would also speak about women in offensive terms. \\"Following a bench trial, the District Court concluded that the supervisors' conduct was discriminatory harassment sufficiently serious to alter the conditions of Faragher's employment and constitute an abusive working environment.\\"Faragher, 524 U.S. at 781. The complaint contained specific allegations that Terry once said that he would never promote a woman to the rank of lieutenant, and that Silverman had said to Faragher, \\"Date me or clean the toilets for a year.\\" Faragher states that there were many times these two supervisors had said things to her and other female lifeguards, and other lifeguards agreed. Faragher stated that from time to time, Terry would repeatedly touch the female lifeguards without being invited to do so, and in areas that should not be touched without being invited. Silverman, the other supervisor would make frequent vulgar slurs to the females, such as referencing oral sex and speaking about female matters. Faragher was not the only woman that was being spoken to this way, in fact another lifeguard, Nancy Ewanchew, had brought it to the City's Personnel Director in an effort to put a stop to the way they were being spoken to, but the taunting did not stop. However, a major factor held against Faragher was if this problem had been going on for a while, then it should have been brought to the City's attention earlier. Judgment The Court noted that \\"Terry and Silverman were acting outside of the scope of their employment and solely to further their own personal needs.\\" The Eleventh Circuit had stated that the supervisors' relationship with the City did not assist in why they were treating their co-workers this way. In this case, the court stated that neither Terry nor Silverman threatened to fire Faragher or demote her so their agency relationship did not \\"facilitate their harassment.\\"Faragher, 524 U.S. at 785. \\"The court reviewed the record and found no adequate factual basis to conclude that the harassment was so pervasive that the City should have known of it, relying on the facts that the harassment occurred intermittently, over a long period of time, and at a remote location.\\" The court felt that if this was such a serious issue taking place at the workplace that these lifeguards, such as Faragher herself, should have brought it to the City's attention earlier. Faragher stated that in many ways the agency relationship \\"aided Terry and Silverman in carrying out their harassment.\\" She argued that these two supervisors abused their authority to keep the workers in their place while they make offensive statements. The Court Of Appeals rejected liability on the City's behalf and that the employer is not liable for what their employees do. The City feels that they should not be held responsible for what the employees did at the workplace. The court debated that since the victim did not receive any harm then the employer should not be held responsible for the actions of their employees. However, Faragher stated that she was working for the City and they should be the ones held responsible. Justice David H. Souter delivered the opinion of the Court. The Court considered the interaction between prior sexual harassment cases and the Restatement of Agency, and found that the City is responsible for the employer's actions based on Title VII, subject to an affirmative defense.

Life  Carry Hauser was born in Vienna as Carl Maria Hauser into the family of a civil servant. He was educated at the Schottengymnasium and the H√∂here Graphische Bundes-Lehr- und Versuchsanstalt, after which he studied at the Wiener Kunstgewerbeschule under, among others, Adolf Michael Boehm, Anton von Kenner, Alfred Roller and Oskar Strnad. He then began his career as a painter, illustrator, theatrical designer and author, which was interrupted by World War I, for military service in which he volunteered in 1914. His war experiences made him a pacifist. After the war he returned to Vienna, where among others he met Franz Theodor Csokor, for whose play Die rote Stra√üe (\\"The Red Street\\") he designed the set in 1918. In the same year the first comprehensive exhibition of his work was held, in the museum at Troppau, and another was arranged for him by Arthur Roessler, although his earlier works had been lost during the war and could not be exhibited. He became still better-known in 1919 through his portfolio Die Insel (\\"The Island\\"). From 1919 to 1922 Hauser was a leading member of the artists' group Freie Bewegung (\\"Free Movement\\"), and also belonged to the artists' society Der Fels (\\"The Rock\\") while he lived for a time in Passau. From 1925 to 1938 he was a member of another artists' group, the Hagenbund, of which he was president in 1927/28. In the theatrical world he was vice-president of the Vienna Theatre Guild (Wiener Theatergilde). During the 1930s in the time of the St√§ndestaat he was active in the Patriotic Front (Vaterl√§ndische Front). After the Anschluss of 1938, Hauser, because of his political stance, was banned by the National Socialists from working and exhibiting. In 1939 he was given an appointment in the art school of Melbourne but was prevented from taking it up by the outbreak of World War II. His wife, Gertrud Herzog-Hauser (1894‚Äì1953), to whom he had been married since 1922, was of Jewish origin and emigrated to the Netherlands and as refugee scholar to Somerville College, Oxford, where she managed to survive the war. Hauser went into exile in Switzerland, where he wrote Eine Geschichte vom verlorenen Sohn (1941, privately published 1945), the novel Zwischen gestern und morgen (1945) and the fairytale Maler, Tod und Jungfrau (1946). In 1947 Hauser and his wife returned to Vienna and took part in the reconstruction. In 1952 he became General Secretary of the Austrian PEN Club, and later its vice-president, which he remained until 1972. He was also a council member of the organisation Aktion gegen Antisemitismus (\\"Action Against Antisemitism\\") and was involved in the revival of the Berufsvereinigung der bildenden K√ºnstler √ñsterreichs (\\"Professional Union of the Fine Artists of Austria\\"), of which he was later vice-president. He died in 1985 in Rekawinkel. He is buried in a grave of honour in the cemetery at Hietzing.Gruppe 67, Reihe 11, Nr. 12  Awards  * 1929: Silver Medal of the International Exhibition in Barcelona * 1936: awarded the title \\"Professor\\" * 1936: Knight's Cross of the Austrian Order of Merit (Ritterkreuz des √ñsterreichischen Verdienstordens) * 1949: Prize of the City of Vienna for Fine Art * 1985: Ring of Honour of the City of Vienna (Ehrenring der Stadt Wien)  Publications  * Buch der Tr√§ume.

Works  His versatile oeuvre as a painter of portraits, genre works, history paintings and landscapes and as a designer is represented in the collections of the Wien Museum, the Albertina and the √ñsterreichische Galerie Belvedere. His activity as a set designer included works for the Burgtheater. He was also prolific as a book and book-cover illustrator. His earlier works were related to those of - for example - George Grosz, Otto Dix or Ludwig Meidner, but by the end of the 1920s he had developed his own style, combining features from both Neue Sachlichkeit and Expressionism.

More specifically known as \\"driver ants\\", the genus Dorylus is abundant throughout Africa and stretches into tropical Asia, where D. laevigatus is primarily found. They are a eusocial colony-forming species, which live primarily underground, rarely venturing to the surface for any reason. D. laevigatus colonies are small for army ants, estimated averages falling between 30,000 and 1,000,000 individuals. Morphology Dorylus laevigatus shares the typical morphological characteristics common of all ants, including three body segments known as tagmata, a slim waist joining the second and third tagmata called the petiole, and mandibulate mouth parts located on the head for holding and breaking down food. Characteristic of their genus, D. laevigatus is blind, possessing no eyes and communicating entirely through pheromones. As a holometabolous insect, D. laevigatus larvae differ significantly from the mature adults, closely resembling white maggots. D. laevigatus has a high degree of caste polymorphism, meaning that individuals within the species have radically different morphological characteristics, depending on which role they play in the colony. Males have only one caste, the drone, which is a reproductive caste and is not present in the colony. Males average in length, possess a pair of wings, and are covered in short hairs. They live apart from the colonies and resemble the night wasp Provespa nocturna, which possibly deters predators afraid of receiving a painful sting. Females are divided up into three castes; large workers, small workers, and queens. Large workers are colloquially known as soldiers and do most of the colony defense and incapacitation of large prey. The soldier caste is roughly a centimeter in length, with an enlarged head to house powerful serrated mandibles. The smallest workers are three times smaller than the soldiers, only reaching an average length of 2.5mm. They are lighter colored than their larger relatives and lack the large protruding jaws. The queen is the largest female caste and is the sole fertile female in the colony. Her abdomen is enlarged, and she has an average length of just under three centimeters. The last leg segments (tarsi) of queens are mutilated and greatly reduced, which hinders their ability to locomote without assistance from workers. Assessing characteristic larvae size between castes is very difficult, as larvae size is influenced by both developmental stage and their caste. Differentiating between caste and developmental stage of an unpupated larvae is largely impossible. D. laevigatus is one of only five species of genus Dorylus for which all castes are known. Ecology D. laevigatus is found on both the main continent of Asia and the Indonesian archipelago. It is highly abundant within West Malaysia and in Borneo. Within these areas, D. laevigatus can inhabit a fair range of habitats, due to the largely homeostatic conditions present below ground. Each nest occupies its own territory within the ants' forest habitats Within its foraging area, D. laevigatus is almost omnipresent, with foraging ants scattered across the habitat. This deviates from the traditional hyper-localized and temporary presence of previously studied army ants in their foraging areas. Like most members of genus Dorylus, D. laevigatus constructs subterranean nests. The nests leave no visible indications of their location when viewed from above ground; researchers only managed to locate them by excavation of foraging tunnels. D. laevigatus colonies are fairly small for army ant colonies, ranging from 30,000 to 1,000,000 individuals. Because the colonies prefer long-term food exploitation and stable column foraging systems to massive raids, there is little pressure for the colonies to expand and support the massive numbers of individuals common in surface-hunting driver and army ants. Additionally, the gigantic amounts of foraging ants typical of other Dorylus species would be of little value in the small foraging tunnels of D. laevigatus. These colonies are also low in non-ant guest species compared to terrestrial driver ant species. When constructing their colony, D. laevigatus will vary the chambers based on environmental conditions; altering between a large single chamber and several linked small chambers. Large chambers are preferred in dry conditions, but chronic wet weather prompts the ants to reform their nests into smaller, more numerous collections of chambers which are less vulnerable to flooding. Within these chambers, the ants form the true structures of their colonies: living chambers of ants linked together suspended within the cavity called bivouacs. The workers link together in an orderly fashion via legs and mandibles to form a living sac to protect the eggs, larvae, and queen. When the colony decides that several chambers better suits the environment, the bivouac is broken up into however many clusters are required to fit the new chambers. The colony occupies the nest for a few weeks ranging to a few months before the local supply of food inevitably wanes. When this occurs, the colony will evacuate the nest and spend roughly 20‚Äì40 hours migrating to a new suitable location. Even these emigrations occur entirely below ground, with workers shifting soil around in the same strata so as to leave no surface indication of subterranean events. D. laevigatus is not without its own predators, even falling prey to other colonies of ants within its habitat. Each of the five most common ant species in a Malaysian study of D. laevigatus managed to avoid, kill, or prey on the smaller D. laevigatus workers. Only when confronted with ants which occupy the same swarming army niche do they behave aggressively, specifically when dealing with D. vishnui, a similar species of driver ant with which it shares habitat. Two colonies of D. laevigatus attacking each other has not been observed. Behavior=Diet and hunting D. laevigatus is an omnivorous organism. It preys on other arthropods, worms, and any other animal small enough to be overrun. When given the opportunity, it will also eat a wide range of foods, such as oil, tuna, cookies, peanut butter, boiled rice, and bananas. Despite this generalized diet, D. laevigatus has never been recorded damaging crops. Arthropod prey is usually consumed on the spot or cut up and taken back to the nest, but the ants will always cover the dead organism with soil before taking either action. Observing these ants during foraging is exceedingly difficult due to the subterranean nature of their hunting. The ants forage using stable tunnels located below ground, giving them full access to their foraging territory. These non-changing columns and tunnel systems originate as a large ‚Äútrunk‚Äùtunnel and then branch out to further cover the entire foraging area. They are unique to the subterranean foraging D. laevigatus; other species of driver ant and army ant prefer a constantly changing system of raids with columns alternating directions. These surface foraging ants also prefer to mix castes in their raids, with large and small workers moving together to search for prey. D. laevigatus foraging behavior uniquely abandons the mixed-worker raid model. The colony uses caste-specific raids to forage for food, with the smallest workers forming columns and searching along natural cracks and tunnels of the soil for arthropods and other food sources. When large or dangerous food is found, the workers widen the natural fissures and gaps in the soil and then recruit larger ants from the stable tunnels to help process or subdue it. When large numbers of ants are recruited to prey sites, some workers do not stop at the food, but instead continue on briefly in a new direction. This is known as ‚Äúrecruitment overrun‚Äùand if food is discovered during these short additional excursions, more workers will be recruited further into the area. Recruitment overrun is one of the few raiding behaviors that D. laevigatus shares with traditionally studied army and driver ants. Furthermore, on rare occasions, D. laevigatus will venture above ground to forage in large swarm raids. These raids are another shared behavior with traditionally studied driver ants, but they have only been observed to occur during the night. D. laevigatus' generalized diet and slow exploitation of large food sources such as termite mounds means slower depletion of available food. Local arthropod densities remain stable even in the presence of a foraging colony of the ants, in sharp contrast to the decimation a colony of typical army ants imposes on local arthropods.2 Above ground foraging driver and army ants have been observed collecting upwards of 90,000 insects per day in their raids, a number which Even juvenile soil-dwellers with less motile ability did not decrease notably in abundance inside D. laevigatus foraging areas. Reproduction Like most eusocial organisms, reproduction in D. laevigatus is handled by the reproductive caste, made up of the sole fertile queen and her consort males. Because the queens are largely immobile, they cannot participate in a nuptial flight in order to found new colonies. Like all other driver and army ants, D. laevigatus colonies reproduce via colony fission. Males leave the nest at an early age and seek one out again upon reaching maturity. Males of typical surface-forgaging driver ants locate the nests via chemical smells. The mechanism by which the subterranean D. laevigatus male finds the underground nests of his species is still unknown. When he reaches the nest, his wings are torn off and he is carried to a newly grown virgin queen who is bred when the colony reaches a threshold size. The queen mates with the male and the colony then splits, with many workers carrying the newly fertile queen off to establish a new colony. There is some evidence that D. laevigatus will undergo multiple matings under lab conditions, but this has never been tested in the wild. The traditional view of driver ant reproduction involved the colony breeding in a cycle of emigration and reproduction phases. During the emigration phase, the colony continuously travels throughout its territory, consuming any prey it encounters. Once the ants have arrived in an area with enough prey density, the colony constructs a semi-permanent nest and the queen lays a new generation of eggs to be raised until local resources deplete and the cycle continues. However, D. laevigatus' subterranean habitat and comparatively low rate of resource depletion gives them an irregular emigration schedule. In addition, the queen's general inability to easily move without assistance hinders colony emigration attempts. Consequently, they do not breed in cycles like many other army ants. Instead, there is a new larval generation being born at any given time, which carried by workers in the event of a necessary nest migration. Behavior When handled or disturbed, D. laevigatus males will move their abdomen in a sudden, jerking thrust towards whatever is threatening them. This mimics the stinging behavior of the night wasp which they closely resemble, serving as an effective deterrent towards would-be predators. Palm oil baits placed into the ground quickly and reliably recruit large numbers of D. laevigatus, implying a far more permanent foraging presence in a given area than with above-ground driver ants, which are notoriously difficult to predictably bait. D. laevigatus has been observed to form fan-shaped above ground raids up to 3.5 meters wide during the late evening and night. Workers participating in these raids were observed occasionally tunneling back down into the earth at random spots. None of these above-ground raids extended upwards into vegetation. During these raids, workers prefer to travel under leaf litter and debris as much as possible and immediately relocate kills underground, which makes observing them quite difficult.

She was one of four Republicans and three Democrats to run. Despite receiving a rating of \\"not recommended\\" from the Pennsylvania Bar Association for lack of trial and appellate advocacy experience, she was endorsed for the Republican nomination by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and by the Republican State Committee. In the primary, Bowes garnered 428,013 votes, or 29.1%, more than any other candidate in the Republican primary race. Along with fellow Republicans Richard B. Klein and John T.

The individual states each have established their own tenure systems. Tenure provides teachers with protections by making it difficult to fire teachers who earn tenure. Many states are focusing on tenure reform. Revisions would be made so that the tenure system no longer functions the same way as the existing tenure system functions. Overview While each state has its own specifics for how teacher tenure works, most hold a similar form. Each new teacher is given a probation period (probation periods vary among states). During this probation period, teachers must prove they are worthy of receiving tenure. They must prove that they are having a positive effect on their students using a teacher evaluation system, which includes information from several facets of a teacher's responsibilities. Some common facets are classroom observations, student growth, and self-reflection (see, for example, New Haven http://www.nhps.net/node/2328 and the state of Virginia http://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching/performance_evaluation/teacher/index.shtml). For example, currently under New Jersey's tenure system, a teacher is placed on probation for three years during which time the teacher is evaluated using a system called AchieveNJ.http://www.state.nj.us/education/AchieveNJ/teacher/ During or after these three years, the principal must decide if the school will grant tenure to this teacher. If so, the teacher will be asked to work there for a fourth year and will be granted tenure. The principal is able to fire a teacher at any time during the probation period. However, once a teacher is tenured, the principal can no longer fire a teacher without just cause. The teacher is then protected by tenure. There are four reasons a teacher may be fired in New Jersey once they are tenured. The reasons include: incapacity, inefficiency, unbecoming conduct and just cause. A teacher being fired for any of these reasons is given a chance to defend their case. History Tenure was created to provide teachers with protections. The exact beginning point of tenure is debatable. From the very beginning, tenure was controversial. Some say the fight for these protections started around the 1920s. Women dominated the teaching profession at this time. The debate=Pro tenure reform Many states are looking into reforming and even eliminating their teacher tenure system. Some of the states leading the movement include Florida, New Jersey, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, New York and Pennsylvania. Many would also like to see teachers being evaluated based on their performance and their students' academic achievement. In eight states in America, tenure is given to teachers after just two years of teaching during the probation period. In two states, tenure is awarded after only one year of teaching during the probation period. Washington DC does not require a set time for awarding tenure. Supporters of this motion feel that one or two years is too short a time to tell if a teacher is having a positive effect on their students. Before these teachers are granted lifetime job protection, they would like to see them perform on probation for a longer period of time. Reforms have been created in all forms. Some reforms call for longer probation periods while others call for stricter teacher evaluations. Other reforms wish to rid the tenure system completely and replace this system with renewable contracts. =Key actors= Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie proposed to reform the tenure system in New Jersey. He wished to eliminate the current tenure system and replace it with a new one. Currently in New Jersey, after a teacher proves themselves efficient for 3 years, they gain lifetime protection under tenure. Christie's proposal would also see teachers prove themselves for three years to gain tenure. However, after one year of being deemed \\"ineffective\\", teachers could easily be fired under his scheme. Christie wanted to judge whether a teacher is ineffective or not on a two part assessment. One part of the score will be based on student achievement. The second part of the score will be based on teacher performance. Christie believes the answer to making schools more effective is to place more accountability on teachers. Christie stated, \\"Let New Jersey lead the way again,\\", \\"The time to eliminate teacher tenure is now.\\" Former chancellor of DC public schools, Michelle Rhee, had made plans to eliminate teacher tenure altogether. Rhee designed a pay plan which would compensate teachers by giving them big pay raises in exchange for their tenure protection rights. She gave existing tenured teachers the choice to accept this proposal. New hires would be forced to accept this new pay plan. New hires would be paid on the basis of their students' achievement. While teachers would prospectively be able to make more money under this pay plan, they would not be granted any tenure protections. Rhee's plan was unsuccessful. Teachers did not want to give up their tenure protections for a higher salary. After this plan failed she continued to devise plans. She offered a buyout plan for existing teachers with tenure. In 2009, she created a plan called IMPACT. This plan tied students performance on state tests to teachers evaluation. While this plan gained the support of many, there were still many others who opposed it. Against tenure reform In some states, schools are required to pay more to teachers who have earned higher degrees, and tenure allows teachers to secure a job, go back to school, and return to their jobs, not fearing dismissal because of their higher pay grade. Supporters liken tenure to the concept of seniority in other jobs. Teachers are often forced into uncomfortable situations (such as failing students, choosing certain students). An employee who makes decisions of a difficult and confrontational nature would thus require job protection. Many who are against the motion of reforming/eliminating tenure argue that tenure allows teaching to become a profession rather than just a job. Presumably, teachers would not have as much job stability and would be forced to transfer from school to school. Giving teachers permanent positions would allow them to form bonds and relationships with students, parents, and other faculty.  Recent reform actions taken Many states have recently made reforms to their tenure system. Some of these states include: *California has seen many attempts to reform their tenure system. One of the more recent attempts was made by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in January 2005. He tried to pass an act (Excellence in Teaching Act) which would pay teachers on the basis of their performance. He also wanted to enact the \\"Put the Kids First Act\\" which would extend the probation period of teachers to five years (it is currently two years). This act would also allow a school to fire teachers after two unsatisfactory ratings. The school would no longer have to give the teacher 90 days to improve their performance before being fired. This stirred up much controversy among the teachers in California. The act was voted on and was never passed. *Florida- In 1997 a major movement toward reforming tenure took place. This reform is considered a success. This tenure reform reduced the probationary period a teacher worked to achieve tenure to 97 days instead of a year. During those 97 days, a teacher could be fired without just cause. The results of this tenure reform do not seem to be making any major improvements in Florida's tenure system. Only 101 of Florida's 10,689 new teachers were dismissed by the school in 1998. While this reform is considered a success, teacher unions stepped in and won back many protections. In 2009, a new plan was proposed. Legislators wished to get rid of tenure for all new teachers. Tenure would be replaced with yearly renewable contracts. After ten years, a teacher would be eligible for renewable contracts which would last up to five years. This plan was never passed by the Senate. *New York- In 2007, Mayor Michael Bloomberg voiced his concern that although teachers could be let go easily during the three year probation period, they hardly were. In 2008, Bloomberg introduced the Principal Portal. This was a tool that principals would use to help evaluate their teachers. It gave them guidelines to follow and base their decisions on. The Principal Portal was successful. The number of teachers let go during their probation period doubled in the first year. Bloomberg also wished to have students test scores incorporated in the tenure process.

Federal politics  Moore finished a distant fourth as the NDP candidate in Abitibi‚ÄîT√©miscamingue in 2006 and 2008; both times, she came up well short of the 10-percent threshold to have her campaign expenses refunded. However, on her third try in 2011, she defeated Lemay by 9,500 votes as part of the NDP wave that swept through Quebec. On May 26, 2011, Moore was appointed the federal Official Opposition critic for military procurement. The key files Moore was responsible for included the purchase of F 35s, the modernization of various navy ships, and the replacement of search and rescue aircraft. Consequently, she worked mostly on the Standing Committee on National Defence, the main forum for addressing these issues. She also assisted Jack Harris with his duties as federal Official Opposition critic for National Defence. In November 2013, Moore was appointed deputy critic for energy and natural resources for the NDP. The key files covered by this responsibility: forestry, mines, nuclear & pipelines. In 2014, Moore brought forward a motion to promote a national strategy on forestry in Canada. This motion asked that the government should work in consultation with provinces and territories, First Nations, stakeholders, and the public to put forward, a national strategy to advance Canada's forestry sector, with the objectives of creating value-added jobs, developing our forests in a sustainable way, diversifying and promoting wood-based products and developing building systems, and by expanding international markets for Canadian wood products.http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/Christine- Moore(232)/Motions?sessionId=151&documentId;=6657428 During the 2011‚Äì2012 New Democratic Party leadership race, Moore endorsed Romeo Saganash. In January 2015, Moore was appointed deputy critic for health for the NDP. She was reelected at the federal election held a few months later, with a somewhat reduced plurality. In February 2016, Moore was elected to the executive committee of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association as a vice-chair. She also served as vice-chair of the Canadian Association of Parliamentarians on Population and Development. Moore gave birth during the election campaign in 2015. She had been pushing for more resources for MPs with newborns since she came back to Parliament in fall in 2015: high chairs were put in parliamentary cafeteria, the Commons Board of Internal Economy also changed the name of the \\"spouses lounge\\" near the Commons Chamber to \\"family room\\" to better accommodate the changing demographics of the House. On March 24, 2016, Moore introduced the bill that would eliminate the federal tax on certain baby products.  Sexual misconduct allegations  In 2018 it was revealed that Moore, as an unnamed MP, had accused former Liberal MPs Massimo Pacetti and Scott Andrews of sexual harassment in 2014. Both Andrews and Pacetti, who maintained their innocence, were suspended from caucus and sat as independent MPs pending investigation of the complaints. After the investigation, both MPs were permanently expelled from the Liberal caucus and were barred from running as Liberals in the 2015 election. On May 8, 2018, CBC News reported that Moore had had a non-consensual sexual encounter with a disabled Canadian Forces member, Glen Kirkland, who had come to Parliament Hill in 2013 to testify about military treatment of injured soldiers and veterans. Kirkland, describing the encounter, stated \\"there was a definite power imbalance and she had a position of authority and I just find it exceptionally ironic that she put herself in this moral, or ethical authority situation now with Erin Weir.\\" She was subsequently suspended from the NDP caucus on May 8, 2018 for allegedly behaving inappropriately while the party ordered an investigation.NDP MP Christine Moore denies sexual misconduct, plans defamation lawsuit. CBC News, May 13, 2018. On May 13, 2018, Moore held a press conference denying the accusations, stating that she had a romantic relationship with Kirkland that lasted about four months between June and October 2013. She provided photo evidence and email copies of travel itineraries in an effort to prove the relation was consensual. On July 19, 2018, party leader Jagmeet Singh publicly announced the results of an investigation into his MP's behaviour exonerating her from the allegations and reinstating her to her previous caucus duties.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-investigation-clears- ndp-mp-christine-moore-of-inappropriate-behaviour/ On June 7, 2019 Moore announced she would not be seeking re-election in the 2019 federal election.

Rob MacKenzie (lead guitar, ex-Leo & Friends, King Harvest, Great Men) and Cleis Pearce (electric viola) were the mainstays. They recorded two albums, Out of the Blue (1973) and Bon Voyage (1974) for Mushroom Records before disbanding in May 1974. Out of the Blue peaked at No. 19 on Go-Set Australian Albums chart. In the 1990s, MacKenzie was a member of United States rock'n'roll revival act, Sha Na Na. History MacKenzie Theory was formed in Melbourne by lead guitarist, Rob MacKenzie, with bass guitarist Mike Leadabrand and drummer Andrew Majewski in September 1971. At this time MacKenzie also met electric viola player Cleis Pearce at a concert in Sydney, while he was filling in with another group, and he was so impressed with her playing that he immediately invited her to join, even though she had no previous experience of playing rock or improvised music. Previously, MacKenzie had been a member of Leo and Friends, and King Harvest. MacKenzie Theory played instrumental jazz rock with elements of John Coltrane, King Crimson, Mahavishnu Orchestra and Santana. At early gigs they supported other artists including, Band of Light, Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs, Chain, Madder Lake or Spectrum. They performed at the inaugural Sunbury Pop Festival in January 1972 and at the second festival in January 1973. Their track, \\"New Song And\\", was included on the triple live album, The Great Australian Rock Festival Sunbury 1973 which appeared on Mushroom Records in April.

During September, Leadabrand and Majewski left and were replaced by Paul Wheeler (ex-Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs) on bass guitar and Greg Sheehan (ex-Blackfeather) on drums; pianist, Peter Jones joined. MacKenzie Theory appeared at Sunbury again in 1974 and \\"Supreme Love\\" appeared on Highlights of Sunbury '74 Part 2. They disbanded by mid-year before MacKenzie and Pearce travelled to the United Kingdom, their final appearance on 15 May was recorded and released as a live album, Bon Voyage by Mushroom Records, although this was reportedly released against the wishes of Mackenzie, who felt that the performance captured on the album was below-par for the group. In the 1990s, MacKenzie was a member of United States rock'n'roll revival act, Sha Na Na. In December 2009, Aztec Music issued a remastered version of Out of the Blue on CD.

Born in Hole, Buskerud to a wealthy family, he married Anne Engebretsdatter Hovin (1813‚Äì1899) from Tyristrand on 23 July 1837. Rytterager became a successful farmer in Buskerud, and had various positions in public service, amongst them elector and arbitrator for Buskerud County. He nonetheless lost his fortune after a few unfortunate transactions in the summer of 1865. When the Kr√∏der Line, a branch line from the Randsfjord Line, was constructed in the early 1870s, Rytterager wanted to become station master at the future Snarum Station. On 14 March 1872, he sent a letter to the operations manager of the Randsfjord Line, asking for the position. He received a reply in a letter from the operations manager dated 28 September 1872, in which the manager approved Rytterager's application. He was officially appointed station master at a meeting on 26 November 1872, at the age of 63 years. His monthly salaries were 15 Norwegian speciedaler per month, as well as free accommodation, lighting and heating and a new uniform each year. The uniform consisted of a trench coat, a hat with silver badge, single- breasted dress and west with flipped collar. In 1873, it was decided that all serving station masters should have a red strip around the bottom edge of the hat, so that passengers more easily could recognize the station master. Rytterager's duties as a station master were ticket sale, freight expedition and supervision of logging at a side track at the station. From 20 March 1873, it was possible to send telegrams from Snarum Station. Rytterager sent telegrams to Vikersund Station, in which he stated the arrival and departure dates of trains from Snarum Station. On 1 November 1873, a post office was opened at Snarum, where Rytterager was employed as post opener for customers. His salary was therefore increased from 15 to 18 speciedaler on 1 January 1874, and from 18 to 20 on 1 November 1875. After ten years in service, Rytterager retired from his positions at the station on 1 December 1882. He was succeeded by Olaus Str√∏m. He lived together with his wife a few years in the house of their eldest daughter, before they moved to their own house at Modum. Here, Rytterager died on 17 March 1899 after he had fallen down a stairway in their house.

The organization hosts arts and cultural programming. The building, built in 1855 as Hudson's city hall, is New York's oldest surviving theater. History Main facade In 1855, the building was constructed as Hudson's first city hall. As city hall it was home to a number of things, including the post office, Franklin Library, and the First National Bank of Hudson. It also was used as a lecture hall and as an art gallery. Around 1880, many American town halls were changing their names to \\"Opera House\\" to follow the fashion of the Paris Opera house that had been recently constructed. Due to the trend, the Hudson Opera House was given its name. It was large enough to continue its government duties while holding different events such as \\"traveling lecture presentations and musical and theatrical events to local functions like dances, cotillions, poultry shows and graduations\\". The second floor of the opera house was a \\"common ground where white and black citizens could meet‚Äù. (Rieser, 2005). In 1962, after the city hall had relocated up the street, the Hudson Opera House became a local Moose Lodge and was later sold to an out-of-town developer. Afterward, the building was left abandoned where it began to decay. A group of concerned citizens gathered together to renovate the historical building; in 1992 they formed the Hudson Opera House, Inc., a non-profit organization set on bringing the Hudson Opera House back to full community use. In 1996, the organization began a campaign which \\"raised the money to open the first restored room in the building, the West Room, in December 1997\\" (Hudson Opera House). Since that time the group has raised enough money to restore five other rooms on the first floor that now are host to numerous different cultural events. Restoration From the back In December 1997, the Hudson Opera House, Inc. completed restoration of the first room, the West Room. It has new floors, a new ceiling, and has been re-painted. It now is \\"in frequent use for concerts, lectures and community gatherings\\". (Hudson Opera House). In March 2001, the second room, The Center Hall Gallery, was opened to the public. Here the group removed and rebuilt stairs, replaced non-working toilets, and it is now used for receptions, exhibitions and workshops. In September 2001 the Workshop Room was opened up. In 2002 the Lower Fa√ßade and the East Room Steps were restored. The Lower Fa√ßade Restoration was set up as it had originally looked when first constructed, while the East Room Steps were removed and replaced. In 2003 the East Room Offices and in 2004 the Center Door Restoration were completed. In 2008 the Hudson Opera House, Inc. installed a new roof and restored the existing 1855 monumental cornice on all four facades. In 2016, restoration began on the historic upstairs performance hall, the largest and most ambitious restoration project to date. The $8.5 million project was funded through a $1.3 million Capital Region Economic Development Council Capital Grant, a $1 million Restore NY Grant; a matching EPF grant leveraging $800,000 in grants from the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation; nearly $100,000 from the New York State Council for the Arts; and $3 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Community Facilities Loan Program. The remaining funding was supported through investments from members of the Hudson Opera House Board of Directors and private sponsors. Interior renovations included restoring the theater to a professional-grade working venue suitable for a diverse range of programming and rentals. Work included the rehabilitation of the stage, performance hall and mezzanine, which now features a new lighting and sound booth. Support spaces, including dressing rooms, a Reception Room and accessible restrooms, were also restored. Part of the project included preservation of the facility‚Äôs historic character, including the proscenium arch and raked wooden floor stage, which were late 19th century additions. The historic fabric was also retained, with new elements sensitively incorporated to retain the overall historic character of the spaces. Additionally, the opera house was modernized to ensure accessibility, safety and security for all staff, performers and patrons. A new elevator tower in the southeast corner of the building makes the performance hall fully accessible to all individuals for the first time in the building‚Äôs more than 160-year history. The facility underwent lead and asbestos abatement services, and new electrical, fire protection and HVAC systems were installed. Exterior renovations included the restoration of the facility‚Äôs masonry, windows and doors. A new roof was installed and the building‚Äôs cornice was restored. The Hudson Opera House was renamed 'Hudson Hall at the historic Hudson Opera House' and officially reopened on April 22, 2017. Events From live performances of theater and music to readings and lectures, workshops, and youth activities; Hudson Hall is a place for everyone to find an event or activity to participate in. During the winter Hudson Hall produces the town of Hudson‚Äôs biggest tourism event, Winter Walk. During this event people will travel to Hudson to walk through the business section (where Hudson Hall is located) and observe music and dance performances while visiting the many new local shops that have developed since its restoration. During the year people can come to participate in workshops that include how to draw, paint, and dance. From Shakespearean productions done for kids to hip hop dancing, Hudson Hall has devoted many resources to creating a family friendly environment. There are also many readings and lectures open to the general public. Hudson Hall is open year-round to provide a constant source of art and education to the Hudson Valley.

The game was developed with Crytek's in-house CryEngine 3. Warface centers around online firefights in player versus player (PvP) matches, with microtransactions allowing players to purchase weapons, equipment, and cosmetic gear. The Xbox 360 port, which was developed by Crytek UK, was discontinued in February 2015. The console version of the game was relaunched for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2018 and on the Nintendo Switch in 2020. Members of the game's development team split from Crytek Kiev in February 2019 to form a new development studio, Blackwood Games, who will handle future development duties for Warface. A tactical shooter spin-off game named Warface: Breakout, was released on May 26, 2020 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2020/05/26/warface-breakout-arrives-today- on-playstation-4-and-xbox-one Gameplay Warface play area at IgroMir 2013  Classes and weapons  Players can choose between five different classes: Sniper, Rifleman, Engineer, Medic, or SED. Each class has its own specific combat role, with Medics reviving fallen and healing injured teammates, Engineers restoring and repairing armor, Riflemen providing additional ammunition, SED's for suppressive fire and eliminating large groups of enemies, and Snipers for engaging in long-range firefights. Each class comes has its own unique weapons and equipment, often split into two categories. Riflemen can choose between a variety of assault rifles and light machine guns, and have the ability to distribute ammunition to themselves and other players. Snipers can wield bolt-action and semi-automatic marksman and sniper rifles. Medics have access to automatic and pump action shotguns, as well as the ability to heal and revive teammates. Engineers can use sub-machine guns and personal defense weapons, and can replenish armor, place explosive mines, and quickly interact with explosives. SED's however, are different as they have access to heavy weaponry, as well as a grenade launcher that does medium damage along with a flash effect. Every class carries a secondary firearm, and an additional melee weapon. Each soldier's tool belt is supplied with a hand grenade, and can be modified or expanded with extra smoke or flash-bang grenades. The Engineer can also carry anti-personnel mines. Weapons have customization slots that can be used to outfit a firearm with scopes, bipods, handles, flash guards, and suppressors.  Game modes  Players can compete online in PvP matches, or combine their efforts against AI-controlled enemies in PvE battles, as well as Spec Ops. As players complete matches and missions, they can earn Experience Points, Warface Dollars, and Vendor Points. The amount of rewards earned varies depending on the number of players, the mission played, the mission's duration, the amount of checkpoints, and other criteria.  In-game currency  Warface Dollars can be used to rent weapons, and purchase armor and other items. Experience Points allow each player increase their personal Rank (level) in the game. Vendor Points are used to progress through the Arsenal tree, which features three categories of items that are unlocked in line with the player's in-game progression: Weapons, Attachments, and Equipment. VIP Booster Packs, which can be purchased from the in-game store, allow the player to earn additional Experience Points, Warface Dollars, and Vendor Points after a match. Another form of in-game currency, Kredits, are a premium currency that allow the purchase of the VIP Booster packs, player skins, bundles, special weapons, and more. Kredits are purchased with real-world money and are often required to purchase high-end weapons. Due to this, players often accuse the game of being \\"pay-to-win.\\"  Development  Promotion at gamescom 2015 In August 2011, Crytek announced that Warface would be released for PC in Western markets in 2012. In February 2012, the game was announced to be published by Nexon in South Korea and Taiwan. The game was released for its open beta stage on Mail.Ru's game client in Russia. In July 2012, Trion Worlds announced itself as the publisher of the game in the United States, New Zealand, Turkey, Australia, and Europe. The closed beta version of Warface was released in western markets on 17 January 2013. On 28 August 2013, Crytek announced that Warface would be released for the Xbox 360 in early 2014. The game was released for the Xbox 360 on 22 April 2014. On 3 December 2014, Crytek announced that it would cease support for the Xbox 360 version of the game, with support being fully withdrawn on 1 February 2015. Warface was released for PlayStation 4 on August 14, 2018 and for Xbox One on September 25, 2018. In November 2018, the game added a Battle Pass to the PC version of the game known as 'The Syndicate'. In February 2019, the game's development team formed a new studio, Blackwood Games, which would take over further development of Warface from Crytek Kiev. Reception Warface received mixed reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Gaming Trend said that while the Xbox One version of Warface was not the most unique game, it was fun and approachable. TheXboxHub praised the game for being \\"truly free-to-play\\" and not requiring players to spend real money to remain competitive, while providing \\"highly enjoyable online focused gameplay\\" and plenty of modes.

In the United States, such a ban was discussed as a result of multiple cases of alcohol poisoning and alcohol-related blackouts among users of such drinks. The majority of these alcohol poisoning cases were found on college campuses throughout the United States. Caffeinated alcoholic drinks such as Four Loko, Joose, Sparks and Tilt were the most popular around the U.S. The beverages, which combine malt liquor or other grain alcohol with caffeine and juices at alcohol concentrations up to about 14 percent, have become popular among younger generations. Their consumption has been associated with increased risk of serious injury, drunken driving, sexual assault and other behavior. Active ingredients One of the more popular drinks, Four Loko, mixed an amount of caffeine equal to three cups of coffee, with alcohol equivalent to about three cans of beer. Critics argue that the beverages are designed to appeal to younger buyers that are used to drinking caffeinated energy drinks. A can of Four Loko contains either 6 or 12 percent alcohol by volume, depending on state regulations. Another reason for drinks such as Four Loko's appeal to youth is the pricing. At approximately $2 a can, at this price it has been reported that college students or younger high school students would be more inclined to buy such beverages. When the ban was placed many students bought out what was left on shelves for resale. Proposed reason for ban The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention played an active role in banning these beverages. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the beverages are regularly consumed by 31 percent of 12- to 17-year-olds and 34 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds. After this was released there was a parental outcry from the majority of the country to ban the beverage. Drinkers who consume alcohol-laced energy drinks are about twice as likely as drinkers who do not report mixing alcohol with energy drinks to report being taken advantage of sexually, to report taking advantage of someone else sexually, and to report riding with a driver who was under the influence of alcohol, according to the CDC. Research has also noted that the extreme levels of alcohol and caffeine in the large serving beverages creates a \\"wide-awake drunk\\" that makes it impossible for people to comprehend how intoxicated they actually are and allows them to consume far more alcohol than they otherwise would be able to without passing out from intoxication. As of November 10, 2010 caffeinated alcoholic energy drinks had been banned in Washington and Michigan in the United States. The bans followed a widely publicized incident which resulted in hospitalization in the Fall of 2010 of college students who had consumed several cans of Four Loko caffeinated alcoholic beverage. Utah, which has state controlled liquor retail outlets, after studying them, never permitted the sale of caffeinated alcoholic energy drinks. The products will no longer be delivered to Oklahoma after December 3, 2010 and delivery to retailers has been suspended in New York. On November 17, 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration warned four companies, Charge Beverages Corp., New Century Brewing Co., Phusion Projects, and United Brands Company Inc, that the caffeine added to their malt alcoholic beverages is an \\"unsafe food additive\\" and said that further action, including seizure of their products, may occur under federal law. In a press release, the FDA states \\"there is evidence that the combinations of caffeine and alcohol in these products pose a public health concern.\\" They also state that concerns have been raised that caffeine can mask some of the sensory cues individuals might normally rely on to determine their level of intoxication. Warning letters were issued to each of the four companies requiring them to provide to the FDA in writing within 15 days of the specific steps the firms will be taking. Manufacturers have argued that drinking a caffeinated alcoholic energy drink is indistinguishable from drinking a couple of glasses of wine followed by a couple of cups of coffee. Adverse effects Caffeine has not been shown to have an effect on a person's self-assessment of their level of alcohol intoxication. Food and Drug Administration In November 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration notified nearly 30 manufacturers of caffeinated alcoholic beverages that it would study the safety and legality of their products. In November 2010, the agency told the manufacturers of seven such beverages, including Four Loko, that their drinks are a \\"public health concern\\" and can not stay on the market in their current form. A member of the FDA said that the agency did not support the claim that the addition of caffeine to these alcoholic beverages is GRAS (\\"generally recognized as safe\\"), a regulatory standard. Removing caffeine The decision to remove caffeine from the beverage came from a review by the FDA, which gave the companies a window to either remove the caffeine and other stimulants in the drinks or face possible penalties under federal law. Experts have said the caffeine used in the beverages can mask the effects of alcohol, leaving drinkers unaware of how intoxicated they are. One of the companies that received letters of warning was Phusion Projects in Chicago which makes Four Loko. Phusion Projects announced in November 2010 that it was dropping caffeine and two other ingredients, guarana and taurine, from Four Loko because of a politically angered environment. Buying binge In the last quarter of 2010, around Washington D.C. there were record sales on the beverage Four Loko. Multiple liquor stores in the D.C. area near American and Georgetown universities claimed that there was an increase in sales of caffeinated alcoholic beverages before they were moved from the shelves. Grocery stores near the George Washington University campus also reported a large sales increase.

Under LIFO layoff rules, junior teachers and other employees lose their jobs before senior ones. Laying off junior employees first is not exclusive to the education sector or to the United States, but is perhaps most controversial there. LIFO's proponents claim that it protects teachers with tenure and gives them job stability, and that it is an easily administered way of accomplishing layoffs following a budget cut. LIFO's critics respond that it is bad for students. They prefer that the best teachers remain regardless of how long they have been teaching. LIFO and tenure were originally intended to provide college professors with academic freedom and ensure that they could research topics of their own choosing. In the K‚Äì12 sector, tenure was introduced to lower high teacher turnover rates. In 1932, over 20% of teachers were dismissed due to personal disagreements and difference of opinion.Butsch, R. (1937). Tenure of teachers. Teacher Personnel, 7(3), 292‚Äì295. By 2010, LIFO was criticized on grounds that \\"seniority based layoffs result in promising, inexperienced teachers losing their positions, while their less effective, but more senior, peers continue to teach.\\"Boyd, D. J., Lankford, H., Loeb, S., & Wyckoff, J. H. (2010). \\"Teacher layoffs: An empirical illustration of seniority vs. measures of effectiveness\\". brief 12. National Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research. As of early 2014, two states provided that seniority could not be considered when deciding which teachers to lay off, 18 states and the District of Columbia left the layoff criteria to school district discretion, 20 states provided that seniority could be considered among other factors, and 10 states provided that seniority was the sole factor, or one that had to be considered.  Effects of seniority-prioritized layoffs  LIFO has a more severe impact in poor or high minority schools, since those schools tend to have newer and less experienced teachers. In schools where 34% or less of the students receive Free and Reduced meals, more than 82% of teachers have 4 or more years of experience. However, in schools where more than 75% of the student body receives Free and Reduced meals, only 77% of the teachers have more than 4 years of experience.U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Schools and Staffing Survey, \\"Public School Teacher, BIE School Teacher, and Private School Teacher Data Files,\\" 2007-2008 Moreover, in California, it was seen that in schools in the lowest quartile of minority students, only 8 of every 100 teachers had two or less years of teaching whereas in schools with the highest quartile of minority students, 13 of every 100 teachers had two or less years of teaching, meaning that under LIFO-based layoffs, schools with larger minority populations would lose 60% more teachers.Sepe, Cristina, and Marguerite Roza. The Disproportionate Impact of Seniority Based Layoffs on Poor, Minority Students. Rep. Seattle: Center on Reinventing Public Education, 2010 Finally, teachers in high need areas, such as secondary math and special education, are often less experienced due to the difficulty of recruiting these positions, and districts who adhere strictly to seniority based systems for layoffs face the added burden of recruiting teachers in these areas.Goldhaber, Dan and Theobold, Roddy (2010). \\"Assessing the Determinants and Implications of Teacher Layoffs.\\" Center for Education Data & Research, University of Washington-Bothell. In Los Angeles, it was noted that of the hundreds of promising new teachers cut in from the district in 2010 due to LIFO, 190 were in the top fifth overall of teachers in raising math and reading scores.Felch, Jason; Song, Jason; and Smith, Doug (2010). \\"When layoffs come to L.A. schools, performance doesn't count.\\" Los Angeles Times, December 2010. Research indicates that the effectiveness of teachers does not change after the first few years in the classroom.Eric Hanushek and Steven G. Rivkin, \\"The Distribution of Teacher Quality and Implications for Policy.\\" Annual Review of Economics 4 (2012): 7.1-7.27. As a result, the implications of using LIFO rules for layoffs instead of basing layoffs on classroom effectiveness appear huge.Goldhaber, Dan and Theobold, Roddy (2010). \\"Assessing the Determinants and Implications of Teacher Layoffs.\\" Center for Education Data & Research, University of Washington-Bothell; Steven Glazerman, Susanna Loeb, Dan Goldhaber, Douglas Staiger, Stephen Raudenbush, and Grover Whitehurst, Evaluating Teachers: The Important Role of Value-Added (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution, 2010); Donald Boyd, Hamilton Lankford, Susanna Loeb, and James Wyckoff, \\"Teacher Layoffs: An Empirical Illustration of Seniority versus Measures of Effectiveness.\\" Education Finance and Policy 6, no. 3 (Summer 2011): 439-454. With LIFO, more teachers must be dismissed to meet budgetary targets than with effectiveness-based layoffs because the youngest teachers are the least paid, but the teachers dismissed under the LIFO policy are only slightly below average in effectiveness. An effectiveness-based policy on the other hand leads to dramatic improvements in average teacher quality, and these improvements have lasting effects on students throughout their lives.Eric Hanushek, \\"Valuing teachers: How much is a good teacher worth?\\" Education Next 11, no. 3 (Summer 2011); Raj Chetty, John N. Friedman, and Jonah E. Rockoff, \\"The Long-Term Impacts of Teachers: Teacher Value-Added and Student Outcomes in Adulthood,\\" WP17699 (Cambridge, MA: National Bureau of Economic Research, December 2011). LIFO and value- added economic modeling In many states, tenure is given to teachers after 3 years, without much indication of job performance. A value added model (VAM) could be used in tenure decisions for teachers in order to estimate teacher quality. A VAM would predict how well a teacher would do based on his or her previous experience teaching. Data shows that the VAM based on standardized test scores, is a better indicator of teacher performance than any observable attributes. Goldhaber, Dan, & Hansen, M. (2010). Using performance on the job to inform teacher tenure decisions. The American Economic Review, 100(2), 250-250-255. In using a VAM to evaluate teachers for a tenure decision, school districts can ensure that the teachers they retain (and the teachers who in turn become the most senior) are effective educators, thereby eliminating some of the discrepancy between LIFO and performance-based layoffs.McCaffrey, D. (2003). Evaluating value-added models for teacher accountability. Santa Monica: Rand Publishing.Retrieved from https://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2004/RAND_MG158.pdf  Controversy and the overhaul of LIFO  Since less experienced teachers typically have lower salaries, it is estimated that if districts in the United States cut 5% of their budget through seniority based layoffs, approximately 79,000 more teachers would lose their jobs versus seniority neutral layoffs.The Case Against Quality Blind Teacher Layoffs.

As the owner of one of the largest private educational services, Yu is known as the \\"richest teacher in China\\", and \\"Godfather of English Training\\". On Hurun Report's China Rich List 2013, he had an estimated wealth $1.1 billion and was ranked No. 245 on the list. On the same list of 2015, he had an estimated wealth of $1.09 billion and was ranked No. 487. Also he was ranked No.1759 on Hurun Global Rich List 2015, with an estimated wealth of $1.1 billion. As of November 2018, he is ranked #148 on Forbes China Rich List 2018 and #1020 on Forbes Billionaires 2018, with an estimated net worth of $1.7 billion. Approximately 70% of Chinese students studying in the United States and Canada have taken English classes from the firm. In addition, the online education section has attracted more than 2 million registered users since beginning in 2003. New Oriental was the first Chinese private education company to list shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Yu stated, \\"My biggest dream is to found a private university, and for it to be one of China's top educational institutions after 40-50 years of development. When applying for higher education, my dream is for the best high school graduates to take my university into consideration, along with the likes of Tsinghua and Beijing University.\\" Yu is a member of the Standing Committee of the China Democratic League.  Early life  Yu Minhong was born in a rural family in Xiagang Subdistrict of Jiangyin, Jiangsu on September 4, 1962. He has an elder sister. Unlike for the time, Yu's mother encouraged him to go to school. Yu twice failed the university qualification exam and lost a year from illness. Yu was eventually admitted to Beijing University. Yu was placed in a class for sub-standard students, because he couldn't speak standard Chinese. Yu was a poor student, both financially and academically. In his junior year, pneumonia forced him to take a year off. After graduation in 1985, many classmates went abroad for further education, Yu began to apply for US universities while teaching English in Beijing University. After three years, Yu was accepted by a university. His requests for overseas study visas were repeatedly denied.  New Oriental  thumb As the largest provider of private educational services in China, New Oriental offers educational programs including English and other foreign languages, overseas and domestic test preparation courses, tutoring, primary and secondary school education and online education. New Oriental's instruction combines humorous, interactive teaching techniques with traditional Chinese educational values. Yu Minhong once emphasized his idea of \\"rediscovery\\", which included New Oriental's self- positioning among the private sector of China's education area, and Chinese international students' discovering and rediscovering of themselves and their homeland. All of these have been based on the background of overseas tide and China's unprecedented development in the past decades. Yu Minhong with his New Oriental has always been arguing that they not only provide students with academic training, but also give inspirations.  Foundation  New Oriental School was established on November 16, 1993. Yu Minhong was the only English teacher at the beginning. As enrollment grew, Yu persuaded some of his former classmates to work with him. One of them, Wang Qiang has a Master\`s degree from the State University of New York. \\"I took Yu Minhong to Princeton University to show him around the campus. To my surprise, almost every Chinese student recognized him. They would call him 'Teacher Yu'. I was amazed to see how famous he was.\\" Said Wang Qiang.  Development  Yu converted the business into the New Oriental Education and Technology Group. In 2010 it was the largest private educational enterprise in China, with approximately 10.5 million enrollment, 465 learning centers in 44 cities and 29 bookstores. As of November 30, 2015, New Oriental had a network of 63 schools, 720 (includes 63 schools) learning centers, 25 New Oriental bookstores and over 5,000 third- party bookstores and over 17,000 teachers in 53 cities, as well as an online network with approximately 11.9 million registered users. Many start-up online education companies claimed they would overthrow New Oriental, whose advantages lie mainly in offline education. Facing the challenge, New Oriental and Yu Minhong have confidence in participating in innovations. In September 7, 2006, the New Oriental Education and Technology Group listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Yu was then labeled \\"China's richest teacher\\" with wealth of US$800 million. Other early founders who returned from abroad, and educators in New Oriental with employee stock rights also got rich overnight. To get listed, Yu Minhong initiated reforms on corporate governance aimed at downplaying his personal influence on New Oriental, establishing himself as a professional manager with the group. On the other hand, the listing of New Oriental represented a trend of education industrialization in China. Yu Minhong held that New Oriental's model would not be a get-rich-quick scheme, while mixed responses had been aroused.  Other Careers = Private Higher Education  Yu Minhong started carrying out his ideal to found a top private university by taking over Gengdan Institute of Beijing University of Technology. The institute was founded in July 2005 under the joint sponsoring of Beijing University of Technology and Beijing Gengdan Education Development Center. It is an independent undergraduate institution which operates under a new education mechanism and a mode of private tertiary education in China. Yu Minhong was elected as the president of council with Gengdan Institute on August 6, 2013 and entered private sector of Chinese higher education based on New Oriental's existing strength.  Angel Investment  After investments in several Chinese funds (including the other two of the founders of New Oriental-Xu Xiaoping and Wang Qiang's Zhenfund), Yu Minhong didn‚Äôt feel the joys of investment, so in 2014, he decided to set up an angel investment fund together with Sheng Xitai, an old hand in PE industry. The fund was named Hong Tai Fund (or Angel Plus) and focused on the angel and early-stage projects in media, culture, education, entertainment as well as high-tech and mobile Internet industries. It also had plans to invest in Silicon Valley.  Anecdotes = Film: American Dreams in China  In 2013, a Chinese film named American Dreams in China was released and became a hot topic across China. The movie was directed by famous Hong Kong director Peter Chan and was allegedly based on the self-development and entrepreneurial experience of Yu Minhong (\\"Cheng Dongqing\\"), Xu Xiaoping (\\"Meng Xiaojun\\"), and Wang Qiang (\\"Wang Yang\\"), under the context of China from the 1980s till now. Yu Minhong admitted that basically, he was the prototype of Cheng Dongqing, but denied that the character based on him was common. He claimed that no investment was made to the film by New Oriental.  First Film Show  Yu Minhong appeared as a guest performer in a Chinese documentary film named Mr.Deng Goes to Washington, which was released in 2015. The film recorded the nine days beginning on Jan 29, 1979, when China's leader Deng Xiaoping made his historic visit to the United States, only one month after that country established diplomatic relations with China. On April 24, 2015, at the film's press conference, and in his office building in northwest Beijing, Yu Minhong promoted this documentary film, by promising that both his employees and he, himself would buy tickets to watch it. Personal life Yu is married and has a son and a daughter. His wife and daughter immigrated to Canada in 1995.

Stephen B. Bevans. Models of Contextual Theology. USA: Orbis Books. According to the American Roman Catholic theologian Stephen B. Bevans, it is also about discerning the meaning and contributing to the course of social change, and so it takes its inspiration from neither classic texts nor classic behavior but from present realities and future possibilities. The praxis model gives ample room for expressions of personal and communal experience. At the same time it provides exciting new understandings of the scriptural and older theological witness. Terminology The term praxis is used as an alternative to the terms \\"practice\\" or \\"action\\" in both theological and the social science disciplines. \\"Praxis\\" is a term not unfamiliar to Christian thought, where Orthopraxy is a term derived from Greek (orthopraxia) meaning \\"correct action/activity\\" or an emphasis on conduct, both ethical and liturgical, as opposed to faith or grace etc. This contrasts with orthodoxy, which emphasizes correct belief, and ritualism, the use of rituals. The term is frequently used by liberation theology proponents, such as Gustavo Gutierrez, who emphasize \\"praxis\\" over doctrine. Gutierrez later clarified his position by advocating a circular relationship between orthodoxy and orthopraxis seeing the two as having a symbiotic relationship.Gutierrez, Gustavo. The Truth Shall Make You Free: Confrontations. Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1990. (Original: La verdad los hara libres: confrontaciones. Lima: CEP, 1986) Gutierrez' reading of the Biblical prophets condemning oppression and injustice against the poor (i.e. Jeremiah 22:13‚Äì17) informs his assertion that to know God (orthodoxy) is to do justice (orthopraxis).Gutierrez, Gustavo. The Power of Poor in History. Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1983. (Original: La fuerza historica de los obres: seleccion de trabajos. Lima: CEP, 1971.) Cardinal Ratzinger (the future Pope Benedict XVI), however, criticized liberation theology for elevating orthopraxis to the level of orthodoxy. Richard McBrien summarizes this concept as follows: > God is disclosed in the historical ‚Äò‚Äôpraxis‚Äô‚Äô of liberation. It is the > situation, and our passionate and reflective involvement in it, which > mediates the Word of God. Today that Word is mediated through the cries of > the poor and the oppressed.McBrien, R.P. ‚Äò‚ÄôCatholicism‚Äô‚Äô (Harper Collins, > 1995), pp. 249‚Äì250.

Distribution  This species is mainly present in France, Italy, Greece, Slovenia, Spain, in the Near East,Ecuador and in North Africa.  Description  Soldiers and nymphs of a Kalotermes flavicollis colony There are four castes of these termites, the nymphs (sizes varies from 4 to 6 mm, color is white or creamy), the larvae (traslucent and smaller than the nymphs), the soldiers (whitish, with prominent brown heads and strong mandibles, length of about 8 mm) and the breeding adults. Kalotermes flavicollis has no special caste of adult workers since all the tasks in the colony are performed by nymphs. The adults reach of length, with a wingspan of about . The basic coloration of their body is pale yellow or dark brown. The pronotum is yellow-orange (hence the Latin name flavicollis, meaning 'yellow-necked'), while antennae and distal parts of legs are pale yellow. The male (the king) and the female (the queen) have a more chitinous body, as well two pairs of membranous wings, long, narrow and slightly smoky, essential in the nuptial flight. The wings are held horizontally, overlapping the abdomen when the insect is at rest, so that just one wing is visible. The females are on average a little larger than males.  Life cycle  The nuptial flight of males and females, both fertile and winged, takes place preferably overnight from the middle of July until October, when they swarm to form new colonies. After mating they lose their wings and build a new colony composed of \\"the royal couple\\" (king and queen) and approximately 1,000 to 2,000 individuals.  Habitat  This Mediterranean species can be encountered mainly quite close to the sea coast in warmer temperatures. Because the termites are xylophagous, their colonies usually live in the roots or trunks of old trees, digging tunnels and feeding on wood, behavior that can cause the death of infested trees. They also infest beams and roofs of the houses, libraries and archives, producing serious damages. References * L. Maistrello and G.

Opened in 1976, it is named for the United States' Bicentennial and also honors the city's one-hundredth year as a city. Located at northeast 25th Avenue and Parkwood, the park covers about and includes a water reservoir, a fire station, a playground, and a soccer field among other amenities. History By 1962 the city had purchased a 6.2-acre plot of land between northeast 24th and 25th streets at Parkwood to use in part for a water reservoir. In December 1962, the roof collapsed on the water tower while workers were attempting to complete the dome, killing five people. The Hillsboro Utilities Commission gave the land where the tower was located to the parks department to build a park at the site in 1975. On June 26, 1976, Hillsboro's planning commission approved adding a temporary fire station on one-third of an acre of land at 25th Avenue and Parkwood, where a park would also be located. Neighbors protested the decision due to concerns over noise and safety, and the city postponed a final decision on adding the fire station to the planned park. The city approved both the park and the temporary fire station in October 1976. The temporary fire station then opened in 1977. That year Hillsboro received a grant from the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission in the amount of $2,500 for development of a soccer field; the city matched the grant with city funds to further develop the park. Plans called for a soccer field, trails, and a playground, in addition to the fire station and water reservoir on the park grounds. On October 19, 1976, the city officially dedicated the still-undeveloped Bicentennial Park in a ceremony on the city's one-hundredth birthday. The dedication ceremony included mayor Miller M. Duris, Oregon Governor Robert Straub, and chairman of the parks and recreation commission, Will Crandall, along with about 100 others. Although named Bicentennial Park, the park was said to be a monument to Hillsboro's centennial, as one-hundred years prior to the dedication, the community was officially incorporated by the state. At that time a sign was installed at the park, provided by the Jaycee-ettes. Water tower at the park Later that year the Hillsboro Jaycees announced they would provide further improvements to the park starting in 1977. There project would start with the installation of $5,500 in play equipment in March, and later add park benches, picnic tables, fire pits, a picnic shelter, and restrooms. The soccer field opened in 1978, as did the picnic shelter and playground. In August 1984, the park was the site of several soccer matches between West German youth soccer team TSU Reichenbach and a team made up of Hillsboro High School and Glencoe High School players. The Hillsboro teams lost both games against the 18-year-old Germans. The water tower was upgraded in 2005 after issues with the soil had been discovered in 2001 that forced the city to keep the reservoir only half- full. A 13-year-old boy was attacked with a metal pole by a 12-year-old at the park in August 2008 after two other teenagers talked the perpetrator into attacking the other boy. The Parks and Recreation Department began upgrades to the park in October 2009, paid for in part by a federal grant. Renovations included new playground equipment, a new bathroom, and landscape improvements. In 2010, the city announced the temporary fire station at the park would be closed after a new one was built at the nearby Hillsboro Airport. Amenities Bicentennial Park is a neighborhood park in the middle of Hillsboro. Features include a single soccer field, restrooms, a picnic shelter and picnic tables, paved walking paths, park benches, and a children's playground. The playground includes a climbing boulder similar to one at Orchard Park, on the other side of the city. The signature large, green water reservoir is in diameter and has a capacity of . The park does not have off- street parking, but does include large oak trees along the southern end of property.

During the Great Depression he contributed several mural paintings to public schools and post offices through the Treasury Department Section of Painting and Sculpture (later called The Treasury Section of Fine Arts). One of his murals that can still be viewed today is The Great Indian Council - 1833. The mural was originally featured in 1938, paired with a mural his wife, Frances Foy, created in The Old Main Post Office of Chicago.Gray, Mary L. \\"A Guide to Chicago's Murals\\".

He attended Lane Technical High School in Chicago and went to college at the Art Institute of Chicago. There, he studied under George Bellows and Randall Davey (1887-1964), two prominent artists of that time. In his time at the Art Institute of Chicago, he received the Logan Award and Gold Medal for excellence. After attending college, Dalstrom painted in Sweden, France, Italy and Germany and focused on oil, watercolor, and graphic mediums of art.  Works  Dalstrom was the supervisor for the mural division and administrator for the Illinois Federal Art Project. As a supervisor, he met with potential sponsors to discuss ideas and potential artists to discuss logistics before any work had begun. Since Dalstrom was an established artist, he did not contribute work for relief. He was featured in numerous exhibitions during the twenties and all throughout the Great Depression. His artwork was shown at: The Art Institute of Chicago, Annual Exhibit of Chicago and Vicinity Artists sixteen times between 1919 and 1945; Annual Exhibition of American Artists, seven times between 1921 and 1937; The Ten Chicago, circa 1920 to 1940; International Watercolor Exhibition, 1929 to 1935; and he was the Illinois State director for the WPA/FAP Increase Robinson's gallery in Chicago. He also had many one-man exhibitions from 1933 to 1935 and served on staff of the Chicago Field Museum of Natural History as well. Murals Dalstrom completed many murals to support the New Deal's Section of Fine Arts in Illinois and Missouri. Murals he created are: five for a public school, one for Highland Park, Chicago, and one for the De Kalb Public Library in De Kalb, Illinois. The mural for the De Kalb Library, completed in 1934, was critically acclaimed to be one of the finest mural designs shown in the last Chicago PWA exhibition May 20, 1934.Eleanor Jewett. \\"PWA Exhibit Proves Worth of Art Project.\\" Chicago Daily Tribune (1923-1963) 11 May 1934,ProQuest Historical Newspapers Chicago Tribune (1849 - 1987), ProQuest.

One mural for a post office in Herrin, Illinois from 1940, was entitled, George Rogers Clark Conferring With Indians Near Herrin. Another mural was The Great Indian Council - 1833. in 1938, commissioned by the Section of Fine Arts for the Chestnut Street Post Office, where it hung opposite the mural by his wife, Frances Foy. An additional mural, The History of Transportation, painted in 1937 for the Lawson School in Chicago, Il and now on display at a law office in the NBC Building, is attributed to Dahlstrom due to stylistic similarities and his active participation in the Chicago WPA program. The signature was removed during restoration. The Great Indian Council-1833 The Great Indian Council - 1833, was a painting originally commissioned for the Chestnut Street Post Office at 840 North Clark Street. It was commissioned in 1934, through the Treasury Department Section of Painting and Sculpture and is a five-foot-by- fifteen-foot oil painting, on canvas. It was originally paired with Dalstrom's wife, Frances Foy's mural painting titled Advent of the Pioneers. The scene shows a group of Native Americans sitting and some standing, listening to their leader. Both murals were removed from the Chestnut Street Post Office in the 1980s when it was converted into a movie theater. Frances Foy's mural was put into storage in 2001 and in 2002, The Great Indian Council - 1833 was treated beginning in 1999 to 2002, at The Chicago Conservation Center.

Illinois had entered the union as the twenty-first state and southern Illinois had been settled in by the frontier settlers. Northern Illinois was still inhabited by Native American tribes by this time from 1818. The Black Hawk War of 1832 terrified Northern settlers and they wanted to claim northern Illinois as their own. The Chicago Treaty, also known as the Great Indian Council, stated that the Potawatomi, Chippewa, and the Ottawa Native American tribes had three years to leave their territory from the Rock River in Illinois to the Grand River in Michigan and One hundred thousand dollars as well. These three tribes were the last Native Americans to leave Illinois. The Native Americans did not agree to leave until 1833. The Great Indian Council - 1833 April D. Duckworth (Illinois History) December 2000  Location  The Great Indian Council - 1833 can be viewed in the lobby of the Loop Station Post Office, located at 211 South Clark Street. Its original pair, Advent of the Pioneers, can be viewed at the post office located at 433 West Harrison Street. It is unknown why the two murals are not paired together today.

Early life  Born in New York City, Christensen earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1973 from Stanford University and a Juris Doctor in 1976 from the University of Montana School of Law.  Professional career  Christensen had worked in private practice at various firms in Montana since 1977. He was a civil litigator and a named partner at a firm in Kalispell, Montana from 1996‚Äì2011. Among other things, he worked in the area of insurance defense.  Federal judicial service  On May 4, 2011, President Obama nominated Christensen to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Montana that was vacated by Judge Donald W. Molloy, who assumed senior status in August 2011. Christensen's nomination was reported from the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary on October 6, 2011. The Senate confirmed his nomination on December 5, 2011 by voice vote. He received his commission on December 6, 2011. He served as Chief Judge from March 19, 2013 to March 19, 2020. In late August 2018, Christensen placed a 14-day hold on grizzly bear hunting in Wyoming and Idaho after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lifted federal protections for grizzlies in Yellowstone National Park areas in 2017. On September 24, 2018, Christensen released a 48-page ruling restoring the protections and cancelling the hunts altogether, citing that Fish & Wildlife's analysis of the threats to grizzly bears was lacking and that they \\"failed to make a reasoned decision\\" in considering the impact of delisting the Yellowstone grizzlies from protected species status. In September 2020, Christensen rejected requests by the Donald Trump campaign, Republican Party organizations, as well as Montana House Speaker Greg Hertz and Montana Senate President Scott Sales, seeking to block Montana Governor Stephen Bullock from permitting counties in Montana to conduct voting by mail in the November 2020 General Election. Christensen ruled that Bullock could waive a state law prohibiting voting by mail, under statutory authority to waive certain state rules or regulations if adherence to them would cause harm during an emergency or disaster. Bullock claimed that preventing voting by mail during the COVID-19 Pandemic would cause potential harm to people voting in person, and disenfranchise others by dissuading them from taking the risk of voting in person, rendering them unable to vote at all. Christensen cited precedent against changing the process of an election too close to the date of the election, or in ways that would render the election difficult to conduct. He further cited that the plaintiffs had not provided any evidence that voting by mail would lead to electoral fraud, and noted that plaintiffs were forced to admit that there had not been a single documented case of voter fraud in Montana in the previous twenty years.

It is named after one of its first known owners, Lady Anne Blunt, the British co-founder of the Crabbet Arabian Stud. Ownership The first owner of record was Jean Baptiste Vuillaume, an award-winning luthier, who found the violin in Spain in the 1860s. He sold the instrument to Lady Anne Blunt, the daughter of Ada Lovelace and granddaughter of Lord Byron. In the 1890s, W.E.

It was sold at auction by Sotheby's in 1971 for the then-record amount of ¬£84,000 by Robert Lowe, who owned the violin for nearly 30 years. (US$200,000). In 2008 it was sold to the Nippon Music Foundation for over US$10 million in a private transaction. In the wake of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami, the Lady Blunt was put up for charitable sale, with proceeds going to the Nippon Foundation's relief fund. Tarisio Auctions handled the sale online, raising almost ¬£10 million (US$15.9 million), more than four times the previous auction record for a Stradivarius, held by the Molitor when it sold for US$3.6 million in 2010. Instrument The Lady Blunt is one of the two best-preserved Stradivarius violins in existence. It has survived, like the Messiah Stradivarius of 1716, in near-original condition, since it has resided mostly in the hands of collectors and seen little use. It was built on the PG form, being a mature golden period violin. The violin also retains its original neck.

Many Indonesian women choose to reside in cities instead of staying in townships to perform agricultural work because of personal, professional, and family-related necessities, and economic requirements. These women are moving away from the traditional dictates of Indonesian culture, wherein women act simply and solely as wives and mothers. At present, the women of Indonesia are also venturing actively into the realm of national development, and working as active members of organisations that focus and act on women's issues and concerns. History Tribhuwanottunggadewi, queen of Majapahit, portrayed as Parvati. In Indonesian society, women performed vital roles both within and outside the family. In rural native society, certain positions, such as dukun beranak (traditional midwife), traditional healer, ritualist, and shaman, are often held by women. Despite their roles seeming to being reduced, if not rather confined, after the adoption of somewhat patriarchal cultures of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity, women still hold important positions, especially within families. In Balinese society, women traditionally play important roles, especially concerning family and economic life. Despite traditional values that hold Balinese women responsible for fostering balance and harmony within families and producing high-quality offspring, in a fast changing society, their economic role has grown. It is common for Balinese women to pursue economic activities outside of their household; thus, Balinese traditional marketplaces are filled with women running businesses. The Minangkabau people are known as one of the few traditional societies that apply matriarchal and matrilineal culture, where property and family names are inherited from mother to daughter, and husbands are considered as \\"guests\\" in their wives' household. Its culture also recognises a prominent historic female figure, Bundo Kanduang, the matriarch of Minangkabau society. Today, Bundo Kanduang refers to the traditional institution consisting of female elders revered in the adat (tradition) of Minangkabau society. In Indonesian history, there are records of some prominent women that held and exercised considerable power and influence within their society, although usually reserved wxclusively for an elite ruling class. They include Queen Shima of Kalingga Kingdom (c. 7th century), Pramodhawardhani of Medang Kingdom (c. 9th century), Isyana Tunggawijaya of Medang Isyana dynasty (c. 10th century), Mahendradatta of Bali (c. 10th century), Ken Dedes of Singhasari (c. 13th century), also queens of Majapahit (c. 13th-15th century); Gayatri Rajapatni, Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi and Suhita. Following the arrival of Islam in Java, Ratu Kalinyamat of Jepara was also a notable female leader. Sultanate of Aceh also recorded several sultanas that ruled the region. Indonesia has recognised several historic national heroines that fought against Dutch colonialism; among others are Nyi Ageng Serang, Martha Christina Tiahahu, Cut Nyak Dhien and Cut Nyak Meutia. Kartini school in early 20th century. The women's emancipation movement was started in late 19th century colonial Dutch East Indies, when a handful of upperclass native women advocated for women's rights and education for women. These women's right pioneers are Kartini of Jepara and Dewi Sartika of Bandung, who both established a school for girls. Women's suffrage was never an issue in Indonesia. Since its first election in 1955, women have held equal legal rights with men in politics, although politics is still a male-dominated field in practice. In 2001, Megawati Sukarnoputri‚Äîthen serving as Vice President‚Äîbecame the first female president of Indonesia after the removal of President Abdurrahman Wahid. On 5 May 2015, following a Royal Decree issued by the Sultan, Princess Mangkubumi (previously known as Princess Pembayun) received the new name Mangkubumi Hamemayu Hayuning Bawana Langgeng ing Mataram. This denotes her as the heiress presumptive to the throne of Yogyakarta. The title Mangkubumi was formerly reserved for senior male princes groomed for the throne, including the reigning Sultan. The decree thus admits female royals into the line of succession for the first time since the inception of the Sultanate. According to the current Sultan, this was in line with his prerogatives; his action was nonetheless criticized by more conservative male family members such as his siblings, who were thus displaced in the line of succession. Women's rights Indonesia signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1980 and ratified it in 1984. National law and sharia The Indonesian National Commission on Violence Against Women (Komnas Perempuan) noted that more regulations that discriminate against women are being adopted throughout the country than are being repealed. In 2012, the Commission noted 282 bylaws in various jurisdictions across Indonesia that it deemed discriminatory, compared with 154 such instruments in 2009. There are 96 that impose criminal sanctions on women through regulations on prostitution and pornography, 60 that contain dress codes and religious standards, and 38 that place restrictions on women‚Äôs mobility. Although such bylaws can be found in 28 Indonesian provinces, the six provinces in which they are largely concentrated are East Java, South Kalimantan, South Sulawesi, West Java, West Nusa Tenggara, and West Sumatra. In many parts of Indonesia, local laws compelling women and girls to wear the hijab are increasingly in place in schools, government offices and public spaces. Aceh province has implemented Sharia law in full, where all Muslim women must wear the traditional head covering known as hijab, and fraternising with the opposite sex outside marriage is banned. Sexual crime, harassment, and trafficking More than 90% of rape cases in Indonesia go unreported, with victims fear being blamed. Sex trafficking in Indonesia is a problem. Indonesian and foreign women and girls have been forced into prostitution in brothels and homes and been physically and psychologically abused. =Women-only transport= A women-only car at the front of a KRL Jabotabek commuter train Since 2010, the Indonesian Railway Company (PT Kereta Api Indonesia) introduced women-only carriages on some commuter trains in the Jakarta metropolitan area in response to reports of sexual harassment in public places, including commuter trains and buses. The women-only carriages on commuter trains are usually denoted by large pink or purple stickers, which read \\"Kereta Khusus Wanita\\". This kind of carriage was previously only able to be found on air-conditioned EMUs (which only provides women-only carriages on each end of the train), but a number of recently repaired non-air conditioned EMUs have also been equipped with the women-only carriage stickers. In 2012, the company launched women-only trains. However, this practice ended the following year after reports found that mixed-use cars were overcrowded during rush hour while women's only cars were underutilised. Marriage and family life Minangs are one of the few ethnic groups that practice matrilineality. Dowry is rarely practiced in Indonesian culture, yet bride price is practiced by certain ethnic groups. For example, the uang panai bride price in Bugis culture. The price paid is based on the education, career, beauty, social and economic strata, or noble background of the bride. In Minangkabau matrilineal culture, the payment of the \\"groom price\\", is given to the groom's parents, as the husband is entering his newly wed wife's household, and is also based on the education and career of the groom. The custom is called bajapuik or uang japuik, although historically a widespread practice in Minangkabau land, today only people of Pariaman that continue to practice this custom. The more commonly prevailing national culture is the marriage gold (mas kawin) or mahar which refer to a gift provided by the groom to be given to the bride. It may contain a sum of money or gold, sometimes because of the adoption of Islamic culture, also include or replaced by symbolic religious items such as praying equipment (seperangkat alat sholat). As with many other developing countries, high fertility rate is a major problem.http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/indonesia_packet_population.pdf Traditionally, Indonesian society has viewed children as a source of fortune. A local saying that more children equated to more fortune and it was widely believed that the use of contraceptives contravened religious and moral values.http://jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jurnal- humaniora/article/download/1808/1625http://www.oxis.org/m-z/idrus-2004.pdf This contributed to a very high fertility rate, recognising that it was a major factor in creating widespread poverty.https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/28140/asra02.pdf Child marriage is also common. It is among the triggering factors of diseases in women such as cervical cancer, and is sustained by traditional norms. Health and welfare President Sukarno with leaders of the Indonesian Women's Congress in June 1950. Many pregnant women in Indonesia do not have the financial capability to pay for hospital deliveries and birthing by Caesarean section, because of disproportionate salaries and medical expenses. Thus, these women require the support and assistance of \\"birth sanctuaries\\" that provide \\"free prenatal care, birthing services and medical aid\\", such as the Healthy Mother Earth Foundation (Yayasan Bumi Sehat) health clinics established by Robin Lim, an American midwife, in 2003. Such 24-hour nativity havens, mostly located in Bali and Aceh, help Indonesian women to escape the common practice of private hospitals in Indonesia that entails detaining newborn infants until medical bills are fully remunerated by the mothers. Nonetheless, the economy now seems to be improving (high GDP growth in 2012 as high as 6.2%) and some programs had been done by the government to help promote the health and welfare of women and children. A ministry that specifically concerns in the field had been established for a long time since the regime of the late President Suharto during the New Order.http://www.indonesia.go.id/in/kementerian/kementerian/kementerian- negara-pemberdayaan-perempuan-dan-perlindungan- anak/1647-profile/274-kementerian-pemberdayaan-perempuan-dan-perlindungan-anak Employment In a traditional market, women commonly run businesses. In Indonesian culture, it is a social norm for husbands to economically provides for his wife and the whole family. Which means husband's earnings is expected to be given to the wife monthly and to be managed by her for family spending and savings. However, it is normal for women to pursue economic activity. For example, warung, a small scale family-owned store, is often run equally by men or women. In most parts of the country, Indonesian women traditionally enjoyed a degree of social and economic freedom. To support their family's economy, Indonesian women are involved in economic activities outside of their households, although mostly informal small-scale business. It is common to find women run businesses in traditional Indonesian marketplaces. Megawati Sukarnoputri, 5th President of Indonesia After a surge of foreign multinational investors began investing in Indonesia during the 1970s, many Indonesian women became the \\"prime workforce\\" and a source of cheap labourers in manufacturing businesses. In the 1990s, some women in Indonesia, including adolescents and the homeless, resorted to engage in employment as sex workers and housemaids due to financial hardship. Some of the women who were forced into such work opted to go abroad to countries such as Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. A rather unfortunate few have since become victims of torture, sexual abuse, murder, illegal detention, rape, sodomy, and other forms of sexual assault. Health-wise, as a consequence of becoming prostituted by human traffickers, some have contracted HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. Sri Mulyani Indrawati, an influential Indonesian economist, currently Minister of Finance. Indonesia is among the countries which have had a female president; Megawati Sukarnoputri served as president of Indonesia from 2001 to 2004. In 2012, 18% of national parliament representatives were held by women. Tri Rismaharini is one example of the rising numbers of female leaders throughout Indonesia. More and more women are becoming scholars. The ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary schools is also even as of 2013. More scholarships awarded by the Indonesian government (and some other institutions other than the government) were given to women, and resulted in higher achievement in their later life. In most major cities like Jakarta and Surabaya, educated female workforce tend to postpone marriage, and girls who finish secondary school are six times less likely to marry early. Susi Pudjiastuti, a prominent businesswoman and the Maritime and Fisheries Minister in Joko Widodo's first administration. Indonesian women could be making considerable shifts to national employment - women currently hold 33% of non-agricultural employment as they also work in the prestigious and traditionally male-dominated field such as architecture, medicine, and engineering. Indonesian women have pursued various lines of work and some have excelled in their careers. These include economists such as Sri Mulyani Indrawati and Mari Elka Pangestu, Olympic gold medalist such as Susi Susanti and Liliyana Natsir, to activists such as Butet Manurung and Yenny Wahid. During the administration of President Joko Widodo, Indonesia had 26% female representation among state ministers, the highest among the 10 most populous countries. Indonesia has increasingly put women in senior roles in the government, business and finance. They include Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, Maritime and Fisheries Minister Susi Pudjiastuti, and Bank Indonesia's deputy governor, Rosmaya Hadi.

There are two classes of TLS-SRP ciphersuites: The first class of cipher suites uses only SRP authentication. The second class uses SRP authentication and public key certificates together for added security. Usually, TLS uses only public key certificates for authentication. TLS-SRP uses a value derived from a password (the SRP verifier) and a salt, shared in advance among the communicating parties, to establish a TLS connection. There are several possible reasons one may choose to use TLS-SRP: * Using password-based authentication does not require reliance on certificate authorities. * The end user does not need to check the URL being certified. If the server does not know data derived from the password then the connection simply cannot be made. This prevents Phishing. * Password authentication is less prone than certificate authentication to certain types of configuration mistakes, such as expired certificates or mismatched common name fields. * TLS-SRP provides mutual authentication (the client and server both authenticate each other), while TLS with server certificates only authenticates the server to the client. Client certificates can authenticate the client to the server, but it may be easier for a user to remember a password than to install a certificate.

It was composed of George C. McConnaughey, Chairman, and Commissioners Rosel H. Hyde, Robert T. Bartley. and John C. Doerfer. The goal of the committee was to pursue provisions similar to that of section 5(d) of the Communications Act of 1934, and carry on such study with the same powers and jurisdiction conferred by law upon the Commission as provided by that act.Federal Communications Commission. Federal Communications Reports. In the Matter of Study of Radio and Television Network Broadcasting Pursuant to Delegation Order No. 10. Washington D.C.: United States Government Printing Office. 1972. Print The Report of the FCC Network Study Staff The study was made to determine whether the contemporary operation of television networks and their relationships with stations and other components of the industry tended to foster or impede the development of a nationwide, competitive broadcasting system. The information from the study can be found in the FCC report titled Network Broadcasting, Report of The Network Study Staff to The Network Study Committee. The report was submitted on October 3, 1957, to the Network Study Committee of Commissioners. Public hearings eventually arose from matters contained in the report starting on March 3, 1958.Network Broadcasting. The Report of the FCC Network Study Staff Roscoe L. Barrow Law and Contemporary Problems Vol. 22, No. 4, Radio and Television: Part 1 (Autumn, 1957), pp. 611-625 No comprehensive study of television broadcasting, for purposes of determining the efficacy of the Commission's rules in achieving legislative and commission policy, had been made. The Chain Broadcasting Rules resulting from a study on radio broadcasting from 1938 to 1941, were applied to television without any changes, although there were big differences between the two media. Radio employed sound alone, while television used sight, sound, and motion. The number of radio stations over television stations, the scarcity of television outlets, high cost of television programming, and the fact that television stations were more dependent on networks for programming than radio made a study of the new medium important. The study was undertaken by a staff of professional personnel recruited from government, industry and universities. It was to accept the network system of broadcasting, supported by advertising; to determine whether and to what extent the existing practices under that system obstruct the effectuation of legislative and Commission policies; and to recommend the minimum changes necessary to attain optimal broadcasting performance in the public interest under the existing broadcasting system. The Committee found that the best way to find this information would be by the use of a \\"study\\" technique. The technique included the following steps: a series of conferences with each component of the industry, at which the component made a presentation before the entire staff, explaining its functions and the problems in the industry as seen from the point of view of agencies, national representatives of stations, independent program producers and distributors, and networks; a substantial spot-check of the networks' files; preparation and submission of extensive questionnaires to television networks, all commercial stations, 60 advertising agencies, 34 national representatives of stations, and all independent program producers and distributors. The study focused on certain key ideas. The report begins with a brief history of the development of television and descriptions of industry components. This was to help aid in understanding the problems which the report considered. These problems included public interest, network concentration of control, affiliation, option time, rates, compensation, \\"must buy\\" practices, and multiple ownership. These problems were accessed and formed into an application of Rules to Networks. Conclusion of the report The report concluded that the network system was a necessary and highly desirable component of the American broadcasting system. The system served the public interest through public- service programming, popular entertainment, and simultaneous broadcast to a nationwide audience. Not all practices were found to be in the public's interest, however. The Network Study Staff chose to work within the framework of the existing network system and recommend minimum changes, such as removing competitive restraints and adding more diversity of ownership and control.

Stanley was eventually succeeded by his son Peter and daughter Susan, who was the company's director in the years 1987-2016.Susan Horwitz, linkedin.com. Retrieved 24 June 2017. History Horwitz started out publishing trade journals and sporting magazines (notably the Sporting Weekly newspaper), and moved into popular, pulp fiction, and comic books in the mid-20th century. It was exceedingly successful in genre fiction: crime, war, thrillers, and romance. Horwitz ventured into paperbacks in the 1940s, under the imprint Transport Publishing Co, with series of 'Sporting Westerns' and 'Scientific Thrillers' and Australia's first science fiction magazine Thrills Incorporated (1950-2). Between the 1950s to the 1990s, Horwitz published some of the most popular pulp fiction writers, including A.G. Yates aka Carter Brown and Marshall Grover, in numerous successful author and title series. Some of the pseudonymous author names were used by multiple writers under contract to Horwitz, which owned the names.

While generating business for local writers and artists, the firm also acquired overseas material and reprinted them with title and cover changes, often complying with Australian censorship guidelines.

Horror and Gothic thrillers Although horror pulps were not as popular as detective and romance, Australian publishers still committed themselves to pushing out 'spine-tingling' titles in that genre. Horwitz also published several horror anthologies. Six were edited by Australian Charles Higham,who mixed horror with witchcraft, vampirism, ghosts and the occult. More often than not the stories he used were out of copyright tales by overseas writers such as Bram Stoker, Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Dickens, Guy de Maupassant, Sheridan Le Fanu and so on. Almost all the Horwitz horror covers were done by Australian artist Frank Benier. Higham's anthologies for Horwitz include Tales of Terror (1961); Weird Stories (1961); Nightmare Stories (1962) (which includes \\"The Mummy's Curse\\" by Horwitz house name James Workman, together with classics, and also unknowns like D.W. Preston)'; The Curse of Dracula and Other Terrifying Tales (1962); Spine-tingling Tales (1965) (which prints Le Fanu's \\"Carmilla\\" under its movie title \\"Blood and Roses\\", and includes the little-known F(lora) M(acdonald) Mayor along with classic writers); and Tales of Horror (classic writers along with lesser-knowns such as August Muir) (1962). Spine-tingling Tales had a 2nd printing in 1965, though no evidence has emerged that other titles in the series were reissued.For complete contents of the Higham anthologies see Mike Ashley and William G. Contento. The Supernatural Index: A Listing of Fantasy, Supernatural, Occult, Weird and Horror Anthologies. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1985, p. 808. The Higham anthologies are rare; While the National Library of Australia has a set, Weird Stories is missing. The only other complete set (including Weird Stories) is likely that in the private collection of researcher Leigh Blackmore. Horwitz also published Groff Conklin's anthology Twisted, (originally published by Belmont 1962 and reprinted by Horwitz in 1963) and several horror novels under the 'James Dark' and 'James Workman' house names. Examples of the horror novels include \\"Throne of Satan\\", \\"The Witch Hunters\\" (1963) and Sweet taste of Venom (1963, as by Dark). Collections of horror stories also appeared including Shock Stories (1962, as by Workman); Terrifying Stories (1963, as by Dark); Horror Tales (1963, as by Dark).Paul Collins (ed). The MUP Encyclopedia of Australian Science Fiction and Fantasy. Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 1998, p. 186. In addition to these, Horwitz had a Gothic Library (1966-1977).

James Workman and James Dark Thrillers The James Workman mystery/thriller books, including sensational thrillers such as Havoc and Impact, and the James Dark books, such as Operation Scuba and Operation Octopus, written by various Australian authors, were directed primarily at the American pulp market, where they were released by New American Library and Signet Books.

Early life and education  Born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, Ramos moved as a child with his mother and six siblings to Newark, New Jersey. He earned a Bachelors of Arts in 1982 from Yale University and a Juris Doctor in 1987 from Harvard Law School.  Professional career  From 1987 until 1992, Ramos worked in private legal practice as an associate with Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. From 1992 until 2002, he was an Assistant United States Attorney in the Eastern District of New York, where he prosecuted cases involving \\"white-collar fraud, narcotics trafficking, labor racketeering, public corruption, and money laundering.\\" He also served as deputy chief of the Narcotics section. From 2002 until his appointment as a district court judge, Ramos was a partner with the law firm Day Pitney LLP. He also served as a commissioner on the New York City Commission to Combat Police Corruption.  Federal judicial service  On May 4, 2011, President Obama nominated Ramos to a seat on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York that had been vacated by Judge Stephen C. Robinson, who resigned in 2010. On September 15, 2011, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported his nomination to the Senate floor by voice vote. The Senate confirmed his nomination on December 5, 2011 by a vote of 89‚Äì0. He received his commission on December 6, 2011.  Notable rulings  On December 3, 2018, Ramos ruled that the Trump administration did not have the authority to withhold public safety grants from sanctuary jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate in immigration enforcement and that the conditions unlawfully violate the separation of powers and were arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act . On February 26, 2020, a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan unanimously overturned the decision stating, in part, that the conditions defined in the policy \\"help the federal government enforce national immigration laws and policies supported by successive Democratic and Republican administrations.\\" On May 22, 2019, Ramos affirmed the validity of subpoenas issued to Deutsche Bank and Capital One by two committees of the U.S. House of Representatives. The subpoenas asked for financial records relating to President Donald Trump, his adult children, and his businesses. Trump's lawyers had asked Ramos to quash the subpoenas, but Ramos said such a request was \\"unlikely to succeed on the merits.\\" On May 28, Ramos granted Trump's attorneys their request for a stay so they could pursue an expedited appeal through the courts.

The Illinois Structural Health Monitoring Project also focuses on creating a software toolsuite that can simplify the development of other structural health monitoring devices. Currently, ISHMP has a wireless sensor network set up on the Jindo Bridge in South Korea. Each sensor board in the network uses real-time data to collect a multitude of different data, and then the microcomputer processes the data and determines the current state of the bridge.  Overview  The Illinois Structural Health Monitoring Project was founded in 2002 when Professor Bill F. Spencer, director of the Smart Structures Technology Laboratory, and Professor Gul Agha, director of the Open Systems Laboratory, began a collaborative effort between the two laboratories at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign.\\"Smart Structures Technology Laboratory\\", Retrieved May 2, 2011 The project aims to develop reliable wireless hardware and software for distributed real-time structural health monitoring of various infrastructure using multiple sensors on a single structure. Each sensor's data corresponding to a specific region on the structure is used to assess the overall health of the structure. The Illinois Structural Health Monitoring Project's underlying goal is to minimize the cost of infrastructure inspections though using inexpensive and reliable wireless sensor arrays, significantly reducing the need for physical human inspection. Its main focus has been to monitor bridges using sensor networks. While other wired bridge monitoring systems require excessive amounts of cables and man hours to install, installing a wireless sensor network would prove much less expensive. The Illinois Structural Health Monitoring Project receives support from the National Science Foundation, Intel Corporation, and the Vodafone-U.S. Foundation Graduate Fellowship.  Technology  The Jindo Bridge in South Korea has 663 wireless sensors.\\"Keeping Tabs on the Infrastructure, Wirelessly\\", Retrieved April 14, 2011 Instead of using a single centralized point for collecting data from every sensor in a network, the ISHMP uses sensor platforms with embedded computers, such as Intel's Imote2. The Illinois Structural Health Monitoring Project has designed, developed, and tested various sensors that can stack onto these embedded computers and sense data such as vibrations, humidity levels, and wind speeds, to name a few. Using various power harvesting devices, there is no need for wiring the sensors to an electrical network. Initial tests for the sensor systems were run on a scale model of a truss bridge. The Illinois Structural Health Monitoring Project has also developed an open source toolsuite that contains a software library of customizable services for structural health monitoring platforms. This simplifies the development of structural health monitoring applications for other sensor systems. In 2008, a dense array of sensors was deployed on the Jindo Bridge in South Korea and was the first dense deployment of a wireless sensor network on a cable-stayed bridge.\\"Wireless Structural Monitoring System Deployed in Korea\\", Retrieved May 3, 2011 This new bridge monitoring system is fully autonomous, and sends out an e-mail when a problem arises.

Developments = Software  The ISHMP has developed a software toolsuite with open source services needed for structural health monitoring applications on a network of Intel's Imote2 smart sensors. These services include application services, application tools, and utilities. The application services allow for the implementation of structural health monitoring algorithms on the Imote2 and include tests for both the PC and Imote2.

Naming practice  Traditionally, ordinary Tibetan people carry a first personal name and may or may not carry a second personal name, but does have a family name which is known as Tethong. Tenzin Namgyal Tethong is a special case where he is of aristocratic descent from the area called Tashi Thongmon, which is abbreviated as Te-Thong. When a person carries a family name, it should come in the very beginning. When the names are translated into English, they have adopted European grammatical practice of placing the family name at the end. Early life Tenzin Tethong started his exile life when he accompanied his family to Mussoorie in 1959 where the Dalai Lama, months after his arrival from Tibet, had started a school. His father was a teacher, and because of a shortage of anyone with knowledge of languages other than Tibetan, Tenzin Tethong and his older brother helped out in many ways. In 1960 when the first children from the road camps and border areas came to Mussoorie he was a part-time English teacher for young children his age and also their fellow student in the next Tibetan class. The following year he went to Shimla where his father was appointed the Principal of the second Tibetan refugee school. In 1962 his family moved back to Darjeeling where he completed his high school education at Mt. Hermon School graduating with a First Division as a Science Student. Public Service career Tenzin N Tethong began his public service career in 1967. * 1967‚Äì1968: Secretary and translator for the Department of Education * 1973‚Äì1986: Representative of the Dalai Lama in New York * 1980: Headed the Second Delegation of Tibetans to Tibet and China * 1987‚Äì1990: Special Representative of the Dalai Lama in Washington DC * 1990: One of the first Kalons elected * 1990‚Äì1995: Served as Kalon Tripa (Chief of Cabinet) and Kalon of various portfolios such as Departments of Finance, Home and Information & International Relations * 2013‚Äìpresent Appointed Director of Tibetan language section of the Radio Free Asia. Social entrepreneurial and political initiatives * 1968: With his brother Tenzin Geyche and friend Sonam Topgyal, Tenzin Tethong started Sheja, the first educational publication in exile, the first Tibetan Non-Governmental initiative. Sheja became a successful and popular publication. While still working with Sheja, Tenzin Tethong also edited and published the Tibetan Review from January‚ÄìJune 1972 with Tamdin D. Gyalpo as Executive Editor. Both publications became part of the information office of the Tibetan government in exile in 1971. * 1970: He was one of the four convenors of the first Tibetan youth conference in Dharmsala, along with Tenzin Geyche, Sonam Topgyal, Gyari Rinpoche. This conference resulted in the formation of the Tibetan Youth Congress. He served on its first leadership executive committee. Since then the Tibetan Youth Congress has become one of the most important Tibetan organizations in exile and has a worldwide membership of some 30,000. * 1973‚Äì1986: He was also instrumental in the formation of several Tibetan initiatives in North America such US Tibet Committee, Tibetan Associations across the US, and Tibet House. At this time he also worked with Congressmen Charlie Rose and other senior staff in the US government to secure the first visit of the Dalai Lama to the United States in 1979. * 1987: During the Dalai Lama‚Äôs visit to Washington, when he gave his Five Point Peace plan at the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, he was instructed to stay behind and keep up with the support and interest many members of Congress had for Tibet. As the Special Representative of the Dalai Lama in Washington DC, he would not have been able to achieve much with the limited resources of the Tibetan government. So he took the initiative to establish the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) as a way to be able to have a real presence which works to promote human rights and democratic freedoms for the people of Tibet while working with the US Government and the European Parliament. * 1987‚Äì1990: With the help of dedicated staffers and US Congressional Representatives who support Tibet, he helped to initiate and played a critical role in securing the first 1,000 visas for Tibetans to immigrate the United States, Fulbright scholarship program support for Tibetan students and the creation of Voice of America‚Äôs Tibetan language service. * 1995: He resigned from government service for personal reasons and moved to the United States. That year, he became the Principal Advisor to the film Seven Years in Tibet and helped the Screenplay writer and the Director with the contents of the story, and advised on the artistic aspects of the film production adding greatly to the authenticity of the Tibetan scenes, dialogue, body language and the overall story of Tibet as depicted in the film. * 1996: He was invited as a Visiting Scholar to teach in the History Department of Stanford University. He taught a course in Tibetan history and contemporary politics, and since was followed by teaching sessions for the Stanford University summer session and Continuing Studies programs. He is a Distinguished Fellow of the Tibetan Studies Initiative and Chair of the Tibetan Studies Committee working to establish research and teaching positions at Stanford University. He also worked actively with Stanford scientists and scholars to organize two visits by the Dalai Lama which became important dialogues between Buddhism and Science. These dialogues and subsequent conferences resulted in the establishment of CCARE, Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education. These efforts further the work of the Dalai Lama who has been encouraged scientists to work closely with Buddhist experts and practitioners whose knowledge of the mind and consciousness may have valuable contributions to make to science and society. Tethong is a member of the Executive Committee of CCARE along with Geshe Thupten JInpa, another important member who visits Stanford regularly. * 2002: Tenzin Tethong was one of the key founding members of The Dalai Lama Foundation, established by students and friends of the Dalai Lama. The founding members decided to work on the Dalai Lama's message of ethics and peace as outlined in his book Ethics for the New Millennium. The DLF started with an initial study guide of \\"Ethics for the New Millennium\\" which has been translated into French, Chinese, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Japanese and Hebrew and it has resulted in hundreds of Study Circles all over the world. The guide has also been downloaded over 30,000 times. Other online courses and educational materials related to peace are available at the foundation website. The Dalai Lama Foundation also works to develop close relations with other organizations that are engaged in the Dalai Lama's work for peace in the world, and collaborates with a number of organizations bearing the Dalai Lama's name; The Foundation for Universal Responsibility of the Dalai Lama in New Delhi, The Dalai Lama Center for Peace Education in Vancouver, Canada, and The Dalai Lama Center for Ethics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. Current roles Currently, Tenzin Tethong, a Distinguished Fellow at the Tibetan Studies Initiative, Stanford University (a program he played a key role in establishing) is the President of the Dalai Lama Foundation, and Board Chair of the Committee of 100 for Tibet. In addition to serving as an advisor to the local Tibetan Community Center project, he is co-founder of the Missing Peace art exhibit and recently launched \\"Tibet in Exile-Fifty Years\\", an online documentation effort to commemorate the last fifty years in exile of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people.

The Globe and Mail, May 2, 2011. He represents the electoral district of Central Okanagan‚ÄîSimilkameen‚ÄîNicola as a member of the Conservative Party. In the 41st Canadian Parliament, Albas was appointed to the Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities and introduced one piece of legislation, a private members bill called An Act to amend the Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act (interprovincial importation of wine for personal use) which would allow individuals to import wine from another province for the purpose of personal consumption. Background Born in 1976, Dan Albas' family moved to Penticton when he was three years old. With his two sisters, he was raised in mostly in Penticton by a father who worked as a lawyer and was active in conservative politics and a mother who worked as a social worker. The family spent a short time living in Whitehorse, Yukon, but moved to Alberta to seek medical treatment after an accident left Dan with severe burns over much of his body. They moved back to Penticton where Albas attended Penticton Secondary School and Okanagan University College. He worked as a martial arts instructor and in the late-1990s he opened his own martial arts studio, Kick City Martial Arts (later renamed Premier Martial Arts). In 2005 his studio held a fund-raiser in which pledges were taken by students who would break boards with martial arts moves in support of a Hurricane Katrina-related charity. The Penticton and Wine Country Chamber of Commerce named Albas the 2005 young entrepreneur of the year. In the same year Albas became a board member on the Chamber of Commerce and was appointed to represent the region on the British Columbia Chamber of Commerce. He helped merge the independent Chambers of Commerce in Penticton, Okanagan Falls, Oliver and Osoyoos into the South Okanagan Chamber of Commerce. He ran the regional United Way fund-raising campaign in 2007 and again in 2010. In 2008 he became active with a community group called the Penticton Housing Coalition advocating for affordable housing in the city, like secondary suites. Municipal politics In the 2008 local government elections the 31-year-old Albas ran, and placed first with 5,656 votes, for a seat on the Penticton City Council. Albas became known as the most fiscally-conservative councillor on an already fiscally-conservative council. Beyond the measures agreed to by the council, Albas sought to avoid having the city purchase or pay for a fire-rescue boat, the restoration of the SS Sicamous, landscaping improvements at the South Okanagan Events Centre and the beaches, mobile radar speed signs, building an agricultural centre in the downtown area and unsuccessfully tried to defer the hiring of additional fire department officers and eliminate a 2.1% raise in councillor salaries (though all were approved by council despite Albas opposing the motions). He voted against opening public library on Sundays to avoid the extra costs and against raising the electricity rate to match FortisBC rate increases (the city purchases power from FortisBC and sells it to citizens), and requiring developers who work with the city to have professional liability insurance, though all were approved by council. Initiatives that Albas began or assisted with included bylaw enforcement fines for aggressive pan-handling, keeping a Canada Post outlet in the downtown area. Believing public transit should be funded through user fees, he voted against acquiring new buses from BC Transit unless it was paid for through higher fares and later sought to raise fares by 25% to fund operational costs. He drew criticism as a councillor for interfering with staff management and for posting speculative comments on his blog regarding privatization of city services. Albas was appointed to be a director at the Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen where he was successful he reducing the Regional District's contribution to the Okanagan Film Commission by 50%; Albas became an alternate director in 2009 and 2010. Federal politics In March 2011, after Stockwell Day, the MP for Okanagan‚ÄîCoquihalla for the last 11 years, unexpectedly announced his retirement, a nomination election was held to seek his replacement as the Conservative Party nominee. Albas faced two other candidates: Marshall Neufeld who had worked as Day's parliamentary assistant and West Kelowna landscaper Russell Ensign. A fourth candidate, Chamber of Commerce president Jason Cox, campaigned but missed the deadline for submitting his nomination papers. The nomination election came under criticism from Conservative Party members for being rushed; the vote was held only 10 days after Day's announcement leaving several potential candidates unable to participate and leading to accusations that the three candidates had been given advanced notice of events. The 2011 federal election campaign began soon after the nomination vote. Albas faced former Summerland councillor David Finnis of the New Democratic Party, semi-retired Ashcroft businessman John Kidder for the Liberal Party, Penticton marketer Dan Bouchard for the Green Party, Penticton doctor Dietrich Wittel (independent), and West Kelowna real estate agent Sean Upshaw who campaign in protest of the Conservative Party nomination process which he felt excluded from due to its rushed vote. Albas won the election in the Okanagan‚ÄîCoquihalla riding with 54% of the vote and his Conservative Party formed a majority government. 41st Canadian Parliament When the 41st Parliament began Albas was appointed to the 'Standing Committee on Transport, Infrastructure and Communities' and the 'Standing Joint Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations'. In the House of Commons, Albas introduced Private Members Bill C-311, entitled An Act to amend the Importation of Intoxicating Liquors Act (interprovincial importation of wine for personal use) (Bill C-311) which would allow individuals to import wine from another province for the purpose of personal consumption. The existing law, which dates back to the Prohibition era, only allows provincial liquor boards to do this. Bill C-311 received first reading on October 3, second reading on December 7, 2011. It received unanimous support by all parties at third reading on June 6, 2012. On Sept. 19, 2013, he became Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board.http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/Dan-Albas(72029)/Roles 42nd Canadian Parliament Albas won re-election 2015 Canadian federal election, though his Conservative Party lost seats overall and formed the Official Opposition in the 42nd Canadian Parliament. Under interim leader Rona Ambrose, Albas was appointed to be the critic of interprovincial trade until October 2016 when he was reassigned to be deputy critic (to G√©rard Deltell) of finance. In the 2017 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, Albas endorsed Maxime Bernier. After Andrew Scheer won the leadership race, Scheer reassigned Albas to be critic of small business issues. Albas introduced several private member bills into the House of Commons during this parliament, though none advanced beyond first reading. Bill C-379, An Act to amend the Bank Act (use of word \\"bank\\", \\"banker\\" or \\"banking\\") , proposed to allow credit unions and caisses populaires to use the terms bank, banker and banking to describe the services they offer.http://www.danalbas.com/mp-report/two- ears-for-listening Bill C-410, An Act to amend the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (property of bankrupt ‚Äî exclusion), proposed to protect Registered Education Savings Plan or Registered Disability Savings Plan from creditors in a bankruptcy settlement; the Minister of Finance subsequently incorporated this protection of Registered Disability Savings Plan funds in Bill C-97; in response, Albas introduced Bill C-453 which contained the same language but specifically extended the protection to Registered Education Savings Plan as well. Bill C-447, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (aggravating circumstance ‚Äî evacuation order or emergency), proposed to make taking advantage of a natural disaster or other emergency to commit a crime as an aggravating circumstance. Bill C-452, An Act to amend the Income Tax Act (gift in virtual currency), proposed to exempt from the capital gains tax funds acquired from the appreciation of a virtual currency which are donated to a charity.Private Member Bills that impose a cost on the Treasury Board are not eligible for adoption as Private Member Bills. 43rd Canadian Parliament On September 8, 2020, Albas was appointed as the Opposition Critic for Environment and Climate Change by Erin O'Toole.

He was elected in the Kootenay‚ÄîColumbia riding as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada in the 2011 election. In the 41st Canadian Parliament, Wilks was appointed to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development and introduced one piece of legislation, a private members bill called An Act to amend the Criminal Code (kidnapping of young person) (C-299) which sought a minimum sentence of five years in prison for someone convicted of kidnapping a person under the age of 16. Wilks, originally from Lethbridge, is a former Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer and entrepreneur. Between 1980 and 2000 he was assigned to several RCMP detachments in British Columbia. He was elected as a councillor for the District of Sparwood in 2002 and then as mayor in 2005. As mayor, he was appointed to the Regional District of East Kootenay and became the chair of the Regional Board. Wilks sought and won the Conservative Party nomination to replace retiring Kootenay‚ÄîColumbia Member of Parliament Jim Abbott and was elected to Parliament in 2011. Background David Wilks was born and raised in Lethbridge but after graduating high school he moved to Saskatoon. He worked briefly in the potash industry while under- going recruitment process. He attended RCMP Academy in Regina. His first assignment as an RCMP officer was to the Terrace detachment in 1980. Over his 20-year RCMP career he was subsequently assigned to the detachments in New Aiyansh, Golden, Penticton and Sparwood. He retired from the RCMP in 2000 while in Sparwood and bought a family entertainment business called Sparwood Bowl and Billiards Inc. with his wife. In the 2002 BC municipal elections Wilks first stood for election. He was elected to a three-year term as a Sparwood municipal councillor. In the 2005 municipal elections he put his name forward in the mayoral election and successfully defeated the incumbent. No one challenged Wilks during the 2008 municipal elections so he was acclaimed to a new 3-year term as mayor. Along with being mayor, he was appointed by the Sparwood council to the Board of Directors at the Regional District of East Kootenay. Wilks and Sparwood gained national attention in late-December 2008 when an avalanche killed eight men on snowmobiles; Wilks established public trust accounts for the families of the victims and helped organize a memorial service which the Prime Minister attended. At the Union of British Columbia Municipalities, Wilks advocated expanding the Meth Watch program to include a registration system to track people to purchase components used in making methamphetamine. At the Regional District, Wilks advocated for the provincial government to give the proposed Jumbo Glacier Resort municipal status, removing the responsibility for public consultation and zoning from the Regional District and placing it with the province or a locally elected or appointed council. His March 2006 resolution was defeated, with Wilks being the only director to vote in favour. Wilks re-introduced the motion in August 2009 and it was approved by the Board, though the province did not take any action. In December 2009, the Regional Board elected Wilks to be the chair of the Regional District. Federal politics In February 2010, Jim Abbott, the local member of parliament for the past 17 years, announced he would not seek re-election. Wilks endorsed Bill Bennett to replace Abbott but Bennett declined. The 50-year-old Wilks subsequently announced his intent to seek the Conservative Party nomination for the next election. He stepped down from the Chair position at the Regional District to better focus on his campaign but remained a director. In the March 2011 Conservative Party nomination election, Wilks faced three other candidates: a 29-year-old town councillor from Creston, a lawyer from Cranbrook, and an engineer also from Cranbrook. Wilks campaign unknowingly employed a con artist who stole an undisclosed sum of money before disappearing. Despite the theft, Wilks won the nomination. During the campaign for the federal election, Wilks faced former Invermere mayor Mark Shmigelsky for NDP, and Kimberley residents Betty Aitchison, Bill Green, and Brent Bush. Wilks was seen as the front-runner but his campaign was criticized for avoiding all-candidate forums and debates, skipping the forums in Revelstoke, Kimberley, and Invermere. During the campaign, Wilks noted that he would seek to direct federal funds to improving the Trans-Canada Highway, \\"proper\\" punishment for criminals, and \\"proper\\" funding for the military, noting that his son was currently serving in the military as a combat engineer in Afghanistan. Wilks won the Kootenay‚ÄîColumbia riding with 56% of the vote. As the 41st Parliament began, Wilks was not selected to Prime Minister Stephen Harper's cabinet. He was appointed to the 'Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development' and the 'Standing Joint Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations'. In the House of Commons, Wilks used his time on the floor on June 15, 2011, to describe why he sees the New Democratic Party as a \\"radical hard left\\" political party. Following the high-profile kidnapping of a three-year-old boy from his hometown of Sparwood, Wilks introduced a private members bill (C-299) which would create a five-year minimum sentence for people convicted of kidnapping a person under the age of 16. Wilks' comments about the 2012 Canadian federal budget made national headlines in May 2012. Speaking at a meeting with constituents in Revelstoke, Wilks stated his belief that the omnibus budget bill should be split into a series of smaller bills, but that as a backbench MP, he had little alternative but to vote in favour because \\"that's how Ottawa works.\\" Answering questions from the audience, he indicated that he and other backbenchers had little influence or input on the budget legislation. Two videos of Wilks' comments were posted online, with his permission. Shortly after the story broke, Wilks released a statement to the effect that he was in full support of the budget bill. During the 2015 Canadian federal election, Wilks made headlines for saying that it was \\"not fair\\" for Canadians to expect the government to take action on missing and murdered Indigenous women and that the matter should be dealt with simply as part of \\"missing and murdered people\\" in general, without using the term \\"Indigenous.\\" Wilks ended up losing his seat to Wayne Stetski of the NDP in one of the closest races of the country by just 282 votes. In 2018 Wilks let his name stand for Mayor for the District of Sparwood. He was successful for a four-year term which will end in 2022.

The code name Geronimo controversy came about after media reports that the U.S. operation to kill Osama bin Laden used the code name \\"Geronimo\\" to refer to either the overall operation, to fugitive bin Laden himself or to the act of killing or capturing bin Laden. Press reports claimed that \\"Geronimo\\" was used in the raid to refer to bin Laden himself, but this was later contradicted by official sources. The official mission code name was Operation Neptune Spear@GMA Twitter, 5/3 (a reference to the trident in the SEAL insignia), with Jackpot as the code name for bin Laden as an individual and Geronimo as the code word for bin Laden's capture or death. In the book No Easy Day, former SEAL Matt Bissonnette, who participated in the mission, states that \\"Geronimo\\" was the code name for bin Laden.Owen, Mark, and Kevin Maurer, No Easy Day (2012), Chapter 10, Dutton Penguin The historical Geronimo was a leader of the Chiricahua Apache who defied the U.S. government and eluded capture. Channel 4 News said \\"According to some analysis today, the U.S. military chose the code name because bin Laden, like Geronimo, had evaded capture for years.

Many Native Americans objected to the use of the name Geronimo. \\"It's how deeply embedded the 'Indian as enemy' is in the collective mind of America,\\" said Suzan Shown Harjo, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Morning Star Institute, a Native American advocacy group. \\"There is little doubt [the] use of a leader like Geronimo to refer to bin Laden is ill- advised,\\" wrote Keith Harper, an attorney and member of the Cherokee Nation, in an email with a reporter for The Washington Post. The leaders of several Native American Indian tribes urged President Obama to retroactively rename the military code name \\"Geronimo\\" used by the SEALS during the killing of bin Laden. Fort Sill Apache Tribal Chairman Jeff Houser sent a letter to President Obama, decrying the linking of \\"the legendary Apache warrior\\" to a \\"mass murder and cowardly terrorist...Unlike the coward Osama bin Laden, Geronimo faced his enemy in numerous battles and engagements. He is perhaps one of the greatest symbols of Native American resistance in the history of the United States.\\" Questions to the White House about the code name were referred to the Defense Department, which stated no disrespect was meant and that code names are generally chosen at random. Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly told The Washington Times that \\"Even though the operation to capture or kill bin Laden is over...the name should be changed so that children don't encounter it in the history books.\\" The Onondaga Council of Chiefs said that the use of code name Geronimo perpetuates negative stereotypes about Indians. Nez Perce member Loretta Tuell, staff director and chief counsel for the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, said \\"These inappropriate uses of Native American icons and cultures are prevalent throughout our society, and the impacts to Native and non-Native children are devastating\\". Jeff Houser, chairman of Geronimo's Fort Sill Apache Tribe, wrote a letter to President Obama saying \\"We are quite certain that the use of the name Geronimo as a code for Osama bin Laden was based on misunderstood and misconceived historical perspectives of Geronimo and his armed struggle against the United States and Mexican governments\\".

The Globe and Mail, May 2, 2011. He represented the electoral district of Mississauga‚ÄîStreetsville as a member of the Conservative Party until his defeat in the 2015 election. Before winning his seat in 2011, Butt had been a political commentator on Mississauga Cable 10 for many years, and president & CEO of the Greater Toronto Apartment Association since May 1999. Butt is the son of the late Terry Butt, property developer and Mississauga Ward 7 City Councillor. Butt first ran for public office in Mississauga Ward 7 city council in the 1988 municipal election and later in 1991 in Ward 1. Butt also ran for the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario in the 1990 election in the provincial riding of Mississauga East. Butt would later run for the now defunct Canadian Alliance Party in the 2000 election in the federal riding of Mississauga South. Butt provoked controversy in 2012 for making a 'finger gun' gesture at Liberal Leader Bob Rae, pretending to shoot him in the House of Commons.The Finger Gun Registry. Macleans, Dec 4, 2012. On February 6, 2014, Butt claimed during a parliamentary debate about a proposed bill on election reform that he witnessed people taking discard voter cards from the garbage and then handing them to other people outside voting stations to be used as identification. On February 24, he retracted the statement and admitted that he had made up the story. He said, \\"I misspoke during debate and corrected the record.\\" He said that what actually happened was that he was relating stories that he had heard during his time as president with the Greater Toronto Apartment Association. \\"I did not see it personally and only said it in the House, not committee. I made a mistake.\\" In the 2015 election, Butt was defeated by Liberal candidate Gagan Sikand. Butt made headlines during the election when he raised the example of Thomas Mulcair, a dual citizen of Canada and France, as a hypothetical candidate for deportation if he was convicted of treason under the Conservatives' new citizenship bill, C-24. Butt registered to run as a candidate for Mississauga Ward 1 city councillor in the 2018 municipal election, and has recently served as the director of government relations for the Mississauga Board of Trade.

B., Schier, M. A., Pipingas, A., Ciorciari, J., Wood, S. R. and Simpson D. G. (1990) Steady state visually evoked potential topography associated with a visual vigilance task. Brain Topography 3: 337-347. While SST has been principally used as a cognitive neuroscience research methodology it has also found commercial application in the field of neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience in such areas as brand communication, media research and entertainment. In a typical SST study, brain electrical activity (electroencephalogram or EEG) is recorded while participants view audio visual material and/or perform a psychological task. Simultaneously, a dim sinusoidal visual flicker is presented in the visual periphery. The sinusoidal flicker elicits an oscillatory brain electrical response known as the Steady State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP).Regan, D., (1989). Human Brain Electrophysiology: Evoked Potentials and Evoked Magnetic Fields in Science and Medicine. Elsevier, New York.Vialatte, F, Maurice, M, Dauwels, J., Cichocki, A. (2010) Steady-state visually evoked potentials: Focus on essential paradigms and future perspectives. Progress in Neurobiology 90: 418‚Äì438. Task related changes in brain activity in the vicinity of the recording site are then determined from SSVEP measurements at that site. One of the most important features of the SST methodology is the ability to measure variations in the delay (latency) between the stimulus and the SSVEP response over extended periods of time. This offers a unique window into brain function based on neural processing speed as opposed to the more common EEG amplitude indicators of brain activity. Three specific features of the SST methodology make it a useful technique in cognitive neuroscience research as well as neuroscience-based communication research. 1\\\\. High temporal resolution: the SST methodology is able to continuously track rapid changes in brain activity over an extended period of time.Silberstein, R. B. (1995) Steady state visually evoked potentials, brain resonances and cognitive processes. In P. L. Nunez. Neocortical dynamics and human EEG rhythms. Oxford University Press. New York. 1995 pp 272-303. This is an important feature as many changes in brain function associated with a cognitive task can occur in less than a second. 2\\\\. High signal-to-noise ratio and resistance to interference and ‚Äònoise‚Äô. The SST methodology is able to tolerate high levels of noise or interference due to such things as head movements, muscle tension, blinks and eye movements.Gray M, Kemp AH, Silberstein RB, Nathan PJ (2003) Cortical neurophysiology of anticipatory anxiety: an investigation utilizing steady state probe topography (SSPT). Neuroimage. 20:975-986. This makes SST well suited to cognitive studies where eye, head and body movements occur as a matter of course. 3\\\\. The high signal-to-noise ratio means that it is possible to work with data based on a single trial per individual as opposed to the typical situation encountered in event-related potential (ERP) or event related fMRI studies where there is a need to average multiple trials recorded from each individual to achieve adequate signal-to-noise ratio levels.  Main paradigm  In applying the SST methodology audio visual material is presented simultaneously with a peripheral, spatially diffuse visual flicker Silberstein, R. B., Farrow, M. A., Levy, F, Pipingas, A., Hay, D. A., Jarman, F.C.(1998). Functional brain electrical; activity mapping in boys with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Archives of General Psychiatry 55:1105-12. and Fourier techniques are used to extract the amplitude and the phase of the SSVEP at the stimulus frequency. When the stimulus frequency is in the alpha frequency range (8 Hz ‚Äì 13 Hz), the SSVEP can be recorded from the occipital region and also from other ‚Äònon-visual‚Äô regions such as the frontal and prefrontal cortex and the temporal and parietal cortex.Silberstein, R. B., Ciorciari, J. and Pipingas, A. (1995) Steady-state visually evoked potential topography during the Wisconsin card sorting test. EEG and Clin. Neurophysiol. 96: 24-35.. Srinivasan, R., Bibi, F.A., Nunez, P.L., (2006) Steady-state visual evoked potentials: distributed local sources and wave-like dynamics are sensitive to flicker frequency. Brain Topogr. 18 (3), 167‚Äì187. Most SST studies use a visual stimulus in the upper alpha frequency range (10 Hz ‚Äì 13 Hz) or gamma frequency range (30 Hz ‚Äì 100 Hz) to elicit the SSVEP.Silberstein, R. B., Line, P., Pipingas, A., Copolov, D., Harris, P. (2000) Steady-state visually evoked potential topography during the continuous performance task in normal controls and schizophrenia. Clinical Neurophysiology. 111:850-857.Nield, G., Silberstein R. B., Pipingas, A., Simpson, D. G. and Burkitt, G.(1998) Effects of visual vigilance task on gamma and alpha frequency range steady state potential (SSVEP) topography. Brain Topography Today. Eds Y. Koga, K. Nagata & H. Hirata. Elsevier Science. pp189-194. Changes in the SSVEP amplitude and phase coinciding with a cognitive task or other material such as a television advertisement are then interpreted as changes in regional brain activity associated with the cognitive task. SSVEP amplitude changes are interpreted in a similar fashion to changes in upper alpha EEG amplitude while changes in SSVEP phase are expressed as changes in SSVEP latency. An SSVEP latency reduction is interpreted physiologically as increased synaptic excitation in the neural networks generating the SSVEP implying increased regional brain activity and vice versa.  Scientific and biomedical applications  The SST methodology has been used to examine normal brain function associated with visual vigilance, working memory,Silberstein RB, Nunez PL, Pipingas A, Harris P, Danieli F.

Neuroimage. 1998;.8:370-376. and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  Commercial applications  The SST methodology has been applied commercially in areas such as consumer neuroscience, neuromarketing, media and entertainment research. In this application area SST is used to measure second by second changes in brain activity associated with a wide range of communication media. By measuring brain activity at a number of scalp locations it is possible to estimate second by second changes in a number of relevant psychological parameters including, Long-term Memory Encoding, Engagement (sense of personal relevance), Motivational Valence (whether the material attracts or repels the viewer) as well as Emotional Intensity (arousal) and Visual Attention.

He was a Conservative member of the House of Commons of Canada from 2011 to 2015 who represented the Greater Toronto Area riding of Mississauga East‚ÄîCooksville. He was the first Polish-born Member of Parliament. Background Lizon graduated from the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow, Poland with a master's degree in mining engineering in 1978. He was an engineer in Poland's Silesia coal mines until 1983. In 1988 he immigrated to Canada, and created Gomark Enterprises, a consulting business that designs and supplies interior stone finishes and imports and services machinery used in the stone industry. He was the president of the Canadian Polish Congress from 2005 to 2010. He assisted in the removal of visa requirements for visitors from Poland. He is also a founding member of Tribute to Liberty, an organization dedicated to building a national monument in Ottawa to honour the victims of communism in the world. Politics In the 2011 Canadian federal election, Lizon ran as Conservative candidate in the riding of Mississauga East‚ÄîCooksville. He defeated Liberal candidate Peter Fonseca by 676 votes. In September 2011, Lizon introduced Bill C-266, An Act to establish Pope John Paul II Day, also called by its short title: Pope John Paul II Day Act. A similar bill was first introduced in October 2010 by Liberal MP Andrew Kania. Both bills sought to recognize April 2 as a day to honour the memory of the late Pope John Paul II. Bill C-266 received Royal Assent on December 16, 2014, becoming law. April 2, 2015 marked the 10 year anniversary since the passing of Pope John Paul II and was incidentally the first Pope John Paul II Day observed in Canada. In 2012, Lizon was criticized by the South Asian community and his colleagues in Parliament when he sent out a survey to his constituents asking what languages they spoke, with one of the languages listed as \\"Indian\\". Jim Karygiannis, the Liberal MP for Scarborough- Agincourt, issued a press release calling the mailer insulting, comparing it to asking someone if they speak Canadian or Mexican. In 2013, Lizon joined two other Conservative MPs (Saskatchewan MP Maurice Vellacott and Alberta MP Leon Benoit) in writing a letter to the RCMP requesting a homicide investigation into some late term abortions that may have resulted in live births. The letter was criticized as an attempt to reopen the abortion debate. Prime Minister Stephen Harper said, \\"I think all members of this House, whether they agree with it or not, understand that abortion is legal in Canada and this government, myself included, have made it very clear that the government does not intend to change the law in this regard.\\" In the 2015 election Lizon again faced Liberal candidate Fonseca. This time Fonseca defeated him by 9,801 votes. In the recent 2019 Election, Lizon was defeated by Liberal candidate Peter Fonseca by 9,821 votes.

He was President of the Eastern League (AA) from 1974-1982. He was president and general manager of the highly successful Albuquerque Dukes baseball club. \\"Pat\\" McKernan is often credited along with Joe Buzas, as keeping the sport of minor league baseball viable in the pre-Stadium Boom years. He was a recipient of the John P. McPhail Trophy twice for best minor league executive, making him the only two- time winner. He also won The Sporting News minor league executive of the year on two occasions and was a three-time recipient of the Pacific Coast League executive of the year, in 1981-1982-1991. He was the head of the AAA expansion committee, placing teams in larger, more populated markets such as Memphis, Sacramento, and Nashville. Pat garnered national publicity for trying out a female baseball player during the early 1970s, and Bill Veeck once stated that if he were to have another major league team, that Mr. McKernan would be the man he would hire to run the team due to his promotional abilities. McKernan was immortalized in Roger Kahn's best-selling baseball book, \\"Seasons in the Sun,\\" where an entire chapter featured Pat discussing the future of minor league ball. In 1979, Pat became president and general manager of the Albuquerque Dukes, the AAA farm club of the Los Angeles Dodgers and thus began a 21-year success streak, both at the gate and on the field. Pat was known for his early adaptation to different styles of promotions. He is credited with giving Myron Noodleman his first break, as he was allowed to perform at eight consecutive Dukes games in the early 1990s to practice his craft, after being denied the request to do so at other ballparks. He is also credited with creating the \\"Cool Yule\\" party along with Sen. Pete Domenici to help Albuquerque's disadvantaged youth celebrate Christmas. The life of Pat McKernan was entered into the Congressional Record after his death. He is a member of the New Mexico Sports Hall of Fame in Albuquerque, The Albuquerque Baseball Hall of Fame, both in 2000, and the Unico of Pittsfield Berkshire County Baseball Hall of Fame. Additionally, in 2000, he was named the King of Baseball at the annual minor league baseball meetings. Pat also received a special award of recognition and blessing from Pope John Paul II, for his charitable works in the Albuquerque community, which was presented to him during his induction into the Albuquerque Sports Hall of Fame.

He represented the riding from 2011Election 2011: New Brunswick Southwest. The Globe and Mail, May 2, 2011. until his defeat in the 2015 election. He was elected again in the 2019 election. Education Williamson graduated from Fredericton High School, and then McGill University with a degree in economics and political science. He later went on to receive a master's degree in economic history at the London School of Economics. Befitting his elite education, Mr. Williamson is an heraldic heir, entitled to inherit a coat of arms. . Although he is a professed monarchist and his father's armorial achievement bears Loyalist symbolism, both his parents were born in the United States. Early career Williamson joined the National Post as an editorial writer and was a founding member of the newspaper's editorial board. He is a past national director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation and has served as its representative and national spokesman in Ottawa between January 2004 and September 2008. He had joined the taxpayers' watchdog group in September 2002 as provincial director in Ontario. In 2009, Williamson was hired by Prime Minister Stephen Harper to become director of communications in the PMO and oversaw government-wide communications from his PMO perch. He stepped down in 2010 in order to prepare his campaign after deciding to run for elected office, and was succeeded as director of communications by Dimitri Soudas.

Williamson was quotedQMI: http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Crime/2012/04/09/19611911.html as saying \\"Like a lot of Canadians, when I heard this story I was outraged and concerned that once again the Toronto Police had targeted the wrong individual\\" referring to the previous case of David Chen who had been charged when he apprehended a thief who had been stealing from his Chinatown store.CBC: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2010/10/29/chen-verdict.html On April 5, 2012, the Conservative majority in the Canadian Senate voted to scrap the long-gun registry.

This comment dismayed many, who thought it inappropriate to paraphrase the words of a man who was killed by a rifle.Tories: Canada's 'free at last' from gun registry. City-TV Toronto., April 5, 2012. On June 1, 2012 a story about Williamson's dismay in regard to International Cooperation Minister Bev Oda's travel expense claims surfaced in a CBC article.CBC News: http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/story/2010/10/29/chen-verdict.html Williamson stated that he had brought the claims up in a caucus meeting but would not specify what he said due to caucus confidence. A member of his staff did, however, mention it could be taken in context of Williamson's past days as the National Director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. In March 2013 Williamson joined several backbench Conservative MPs in speaking to a Point of Privilege launched by MP Mark Warawa to the Speaker. Williamson advocated to increase the freedom of individual MPs to speak in the House of Commons by encouraging the Speaker to recognize any MP who wishes to make a Member's Statement and also to pose a question in Question Period. The practice of the Speaker up to that point had been to recognize MPs who were allocated speaking spots by each party's leadership. Williamson has said Alward should schedule the Senate vote for the same day as the 2014 provincial election. \\"I worry that if we wait until 2016, we're going to miss an opportunity, when the next Senate vacancy after that won't be until 2020, and that's an awfully long time,\\" Williamson said. He also supported Bill C-461, a controversial private member's bill that would have enacted a law that would publicly disclose the names and salaries of every federal employee earning in excess of $188,000. In a speech supporting the bill, Williamson stated that he thought the threshold should be even lower, and set at the rate of pay of MPs, which was $157,000 at the time.http://parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=Hansard&Doc;=229&Parl;=41&Ses;=1&Language;=E&Mode;=1 On October 1, 2014, Williamson made a statement in the House of Commons criticising the incoming Liberal provincial government in New Brunswick over its moratorium on shale gas development.http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode;=1&Parl;=41&Ses;=2&DocId;=6710740 On March 8, 2015, it was reported that Williamson made this remark about the Temporary Foreign Workers Program: \\"It makes no sense to pay 'whities' to stay home while we bring in brown people to work in these jobs.\\" Williamson later apologized on Twitter for his \\"offensive and inappropriate language\\".John Williamson apologizes for 'offensive' comment on temporary workers program.

He was a Parti Qu√©b√©cois member of the National Assembly of Quebec from 1976 to 1985 and was a cabinet minister in the governments of Ren√© L√©vesque and Pierre-Marc Johnson. He is the grandfather of Kansas City Chiefs guard Laurent Duvernay- Tardif. Early life and career Tardif was born in Montreal, received his early education in that city, and later studied at the University of Ottawa and the Universit√© de Montr√©al. He was a Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officer from 1955 to 1960 and was a lecturer and administrative assistant for the Montreal Police Service from 1963 to 1970. He received a master's degree in criminology in 1966 and earned a Ph.D. from the Universit√© de Montr√©al in 1974 for a thesis submission entitled Police et politique au Qu√©bec. Tardif also wrote several articles on police and prison issues and was a consultant for various government departments and commissions before launching his own career in politics. Legislator and cabinet minister ;Municipal affairs minister Tardif was elected to the Quebec legislature in the 1976 provincial election, defeating one-term Liberal incumbent Jean Bienvenue in the Montreal division of Cr√©mazie as the Parti Qu√©b√©cois won a historic majority government across the province. He was appointed to Ren√© L√©vesque's first cabinet as minister of municipal affairs on November 26, 1976. In 1978, Tardif and Andr√© Ouellet, the urban affairs minister in Pierre Trudeau's federal cabinet, engaged in a public dispute as to which level of government was responsible for delays in proceeding with planned housing construction.William Johnson, \\"Conference used to catch votes, Levesque says,\\" The Globe and Mail, February 16, 1978, p. 1. The journalist William Johnson argued in a The Globe and Mail editorial that the Quebec Housing Corporation was at fault, notwithstanding Tardif's statements to the contrary.William Johnson, \\"View from Quebec,\\" The Globe and Mail, February 20, 1978, p. 8.

Tardif ended a provincial trusteeship over the Montreal suburb of St. Leonard in 1979. The trusteeship had been imposed by the previous Liberal government in 1975, following allegations of municipal corruption.\\"Quebec lifting ...\\", The Globe and Mail, December 22, 1978, p. 4. He also allowed the town of Buckingham, which had been merged into a single entity by the previous government, to dissolve itself into four distinct municipalities following a referendum.Henry Aubin, \\"PQ betrays its past: Two decades ago, Levesque undid Bourassa's mergers in the Outaouais,\\" Montreal Gazette, September 17, 2001, B3. Notwithstanding his criticism of Tardif in other respects, William Johnson also credited him with \\"[taking] the politics out of municipal financing by establishing formula grants.\\"William Johnson, \\"Cautious Cabinet moves pick up a good pair,\\" The Globe and Mail, November 7, 1980, p. 8. ;Minister of planning and housing L√©vesque shuffled his cabinet on November 6, 1980, and appointed Tardif as the minister of state responsible for planning and the minister responsible for housing.\\"2 ministers gone in PQ Cabinet shuffle,\\" The Globe and Mail, September 7, 1980, p. 11. In December 1980, Tardif was forced to defend his hiring of Luc Cyr, two years earlier, to oversee a program of repairs for low-rent housing. Cyr, an associate of PQ organizers, later put his son and brother-in-law on the payroll; the president of the housing corporation overturned this arrangement once he discovered it.Graham Fraser, PQ: Ren√© L√©vesque and the Parti Qu√©b√©cois in Power, Toronto: MacMillan of Canada, 1984, p. 261. Tardif defended Cyr's appointment, saying that it was normal for such contracts not to go to tender because of the difficulties in predicting expenses. He added the government had cancelled the contract in September 1980 once officials had identified irregularities.Margot Gibb-Clark, \\"PQ denies patronage charges over repairs to public housing,\\" December 8, 1980, p. 9; \\"Quebec Assembly torn by charges of payoffs,\\" The Globe and Mail, December 18, 1980, p. 11.

He was narrowly re-elected in Cr√©mazie as the PQ won a second majority across the province. After a cabinet shuffle on April 30, 1981, he retained his position as the minister responsible for housing and was given additional responsibilities as the minister responsible for consumer protection. On June 18, after enabling legislation was passed, he was officially styled as minister of housing and minister of consumer protection.Fraser, PQ, p. 382. Tardif introduced the government's promised housing loan program, in a somewhat modified form, in August 1981.\\"Quebec planning to cut election housing pledge,\\" The Globe and Mail, August 6, 1981, B2. The opposition Liberals charged that the amended legislation did not adequately protect homeowners affected by high mortgage rates.\\"Ryan to stress use of Hydro's money in criticism of PQ,\\" The Globe and Mail, August 22, 1981, N4. As consumer affairs minister, Tardif was once again in regular contact with Andr√© Ouellet, who by this time was the minister of consumer and corporate affairs in the re-elected government of Pierre Trudeau. In September 1981, he criticized Ouellet's plan to strengthen the competition laws that protected consumers and small businesses. Tardif said that he did not object to the intention of the bill, but argued that the matter fell under Quebec's jurisdiction rather than that of the federal government.\\"Ontario, Quebec oppose federal anti-combines plans,\\" The Globe and Mail, September 5, 1981, B6. In 1982, Tardif expressed the PQ government's opposition to any transfer of flights from Dorval International Airport in Montreal to Mirabel International Airport outside of the city. He argued that the change, if imposed by the federal government, would have a devastating impact on Quebec's economy.\\"Quebec opposes switch of Dorval flights,\\" The Globe and Mail, March 6, 1982, p. 15. During the same period, Tardif convinced construction unions to make concessions and contractors to accept lower profits in order to construct fifty thousand units of low-income housing in a project called Corv√©e-Habitation. Many years later, PQ leader Bernard Landry cited the project as one of Tardif's greatest accomplishments.Irwin Block, \\"Man of many careers was PQ cabinet minister: Guy Tardif 'showed determination in everything he undertook',\\" Montreal Gazette, May 29, 2005, D7. ;1984 PQ crisis In 1984, the Parti Qu√©b√©cois went through an internal crisis over the nature of its support for Quebec sovereignty. Some leading party figures, including Ren√© L√©vesque, wanted to moderate the party's position, while others favoured a more hardline ind√©pendantiste approach. Tardif was initially seen as close to the latter group; in early November 1984, he joined twelve other cabinet ministers in signing a manifesto that called for the party to re-affirm its commitment to Quebec independence.\\"PQ hard-liner reaffirms policy after signing compromise pact,\\" The Globe and Mail, November 13, 1984, N3. However, when several ind√©pendantiste ministers quit the government later in the month, Tardif did not join them. L√©vesque shuffled his cabinet after the ind√©pendantiste resignations and appointed Tardif as transport minister on November 27, 1984. ;Transport minister In April 1985, Tardif said that a provincial agency had purchased a twenty-two per cent interest in the Montreal-based airline Nordair. He added that his government's plan was to facilitate a merger of Nordair and Quebecair, a French-language firm owned by the same provincial agency.\\"Nordair stake,\\" The Globe and Mail, April 27, 1985, B2. The company that owned a controlling interest in Nordair responded that it was opposed to the purchase, and would fight it.\\"Principal Nordair shareholder to fight Quebec stock purchase,\\" The Globe and Mail, April 29, 1985, p. 5. See also Robert Gibbens, \\"Quebecair makes cash bid for profit- making Nordair,\\" The Globe and Mail, September 21, 1985, B4.

In the fall of 1985, Tardif asked Velo Quebec to organize a cycling tour on new paths in the city's east end. The resulting event eventually became known as the Tour de l'ile de Montreal; in later years, it became the largest participatory cycling tour in the world.Sylvie Dupuis, \\"Thousands ride in rain to inaugurate bike path,\\" Montreal Gazette, October 15, 1985, A3; Dave Stubbs, \\"World's largest cycling event will be transforming the city,\\" Montreal Gazette, June 7, 1991, D7. ;Johnson ministry Ren√© L√©vesque announced his resignation as premier of Quebec and Parti Qu√©b√©cois leader in June 1985. There was some speculation that Tardif would be a candidate in the race to succeed him, but this did not occur.\\"Johnson seems voters' choice in impending succession race,\\" The Globe and Mail, June 22, 1985, p. 12. Tardif initially supported Bernard Landry's candidacy, and then declined to back another candidate after Landry withdrew from the contest.Lewis Harris, \\"Johnson says he's undecided about pursuing PQ leadership,\\" Montreal Gazette, June 28, 1985, A4. Pierre-Marc Johnson succeeded L√©vesque in October 1985 and kept Tardif in the transport portfolio when he announced his cabinet.\\"Premier responsible for second portfolio,\\" The Globe and Mail, October 17, 1985, A5. In early November, he reached a deal with the federal government to re-open Quebec City's downtown rail line.Robert McKenzie, \\"PQ applauds $5.8 million in federal aid,\\" Toronto Star, November 9, 1985, A3. Tardif was defeated in the 1985 provincial election, as the Liberal Party was elected with a majority government across the province. He resigned from cabinet with the rest of the Johnson ministry on December 12, 1985. Graham Fraser has written Tardif was known for his \\"ferocious work habits\\" during his time in government, sometimes calling civil servants during the night to discuss office matters.Fraser, PQ, p. 247. After politics Tardif co-founded a company called Le Clos Saint-Denis in 1989, operating a fruit orchard and vineyard. In 1999, he introduced a new brand of ice cider called Pommes de Glace.Bill Zacharkiw, \\"A new era for cider,\\" Montreal Gazette, September 15, 2007, H1. He also returned to academia in 1989, teaching criminology at the Universit√© de Montr√©al. The Civic Party of Montreal tried to draft Tardif as a possible mayoral candidate in the 1990 municipal election, but he declined.Lewis Harris, \\"Civic Party to elect leader in April; Winner will automatically be candidate for mayor,\\" Montreal Gazette, January 24, 1990, A3. He died on May 24, 2005, of pleural mesothelioma, which was apparently caused by asbestos inhalation many years earlier.

Most of the Doven Kingdom Army was killed and the King of Doven, named Fayla, ran into the Dark Forest, powerless and without soldiers or guards to protect him. His wife, children, and the Doven General were all imprisoned at the Icegreen Island. But Fayla was not hopeless. There was one last warrior, named [Player], from the Doven Kingdom who had intelligence, strength, and many talents. King Fayla ordered [Player] to find and rescue his family and destroy all enemies of the Land of Doven.  Chapter 1: Clear the Village  The first set of missions takes place in the Dark Forest. * Mission 1 [Escape] * Mission 2 [War Begin] * Mission 3 [Defeat The Master] * Mission 4 [Knight Terror] * Mission 5 [Get Out From Knight] * Mission 6 [Two Step]  Chapter 2: Dogfire Forces  The second set of missions takes place in the Rock Village. * Mission 7 [Kill All Riflemen] * Mission 8 [Hold Out] * Mission 9 [The Magic Power] * Mission 10 [The Moto] * Mission 11 [Jeep Target] * Mission 12 [Truck Invasion] * Mission 13 [Snow Gate]  Chapter 3: Tower Defence  The third set of missions takes place in the Iceberg Village. * Mission 14 [The Tower] * Mission 15 [Fire And Water] * Mission 16 [Bridge To Tower] * Mission 17 [Bomb Terror] * Mission 18 [Tank Turn] * Mission 19 [Laser And Sonic]  Chapter 4: Battle On The Sea  The fourth set of missions takes place at the Port Village & in the Blue Deep Sea. * Mission 20 [Ship Arrived] * Mission 21 [The Destroyer] * Mission 22 [Submarine Attack] * Mission 23 [Helicopter!!]  Strategy Defense 2  The second Strategy Defense game was released in 2007. It focuses on three kingdoms: Doven Kingdom, Eagle White Kingdom, and Black Horse Kingdom. Opening Text: 3 years later, after the invasion of the Dogfire Kingdom by the Doven Kingdom. There are now 3 kingdoms. Black Horse Kingdom, led by a bad king named King Dark Anger; Eagle White Kingdom, led by a magician king named King White Angel; and Doven Kingdom, led by a wise king named King Fayla. Doven Kingdom was attacked by Black Horse aircraft (a helicopter and a jet). Black Horse aircraft destroyed some buildings and killed the civilians of the Doven Kingdom. The Tower Defense of Doven Kingdom could destroy the enemies, but then the Doven Ministry (named Arthur Douglas) was kidnapped. King Fayla was very angry and ordered his General ([Player]) to get revenge. [Player] is assisted by Arthur Douglas's son, Harry Douglas, who wants to rescue his father.

It is also sometimes found in Polynesian-influenced Chinese food. It is a type of \\"white sauce\\" within Chinese cooking, meaning that it is of a mild flavour, and based on meat stock, as opposed to soy sauce. The version of lobster sauce used in Cantonese cuisine The sauce itself does not contain any lobster, and may vary in preparation method from place to place or restaurant to restaurant. It can contain chicken broth, garlic, ginger, green onions, fermented black beans, and eggs, and is thickened with starch. Some recipes incorporate pork mince and soy sauce. The colour varies from being pale white to brown, or to a yellow, depending on the quantity of soy sauce used and how the eggs are incorporated into the sauce. Lobster sauce in most of New England, where it is a thicker, brown sauce, is the exception.  Origin  \\"Lobster sauce\\" was invented in North America by Chinese restaurateurs inspired by a method of preparing lobster in Cantonese cuisine where ginger, green onions, and soy sauce were used as stir-fry seasoning. The seasoning mixture was made into a sauce that was used in cooking lobster. Due to the cost of serving lobster for restaurateurs and their customers, shrimp was eventually substituted in the recipe resulting in a dish commonly known as \\"Shrimp with Lobster Sauce\\" ().

Sato was initially an enthusiastic supporter of nuclear power. Like his predecessors he appreciated the jobs and subsidies associated with the nuclear plants in the prefecture. He believed it was part of Fukushima playing a role in the Japanese nation as a whole. In 1998 he conditionally agreed the controversial use of mixed oxide plutonium uranium fuel (MOX) at the Fukushima plant, withdrawing his support after discovering a cover-up of reactor malfunctions and cracks. Between 2002 and 2006 twenty-one problems at the Fukushima plant were reported to his office. The whistleblowers, including some employees at the plant, bypassed both Tepco and Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency because they feared that their information would go straight to Tepco. This was later shown to be a very justified fear. Sato became an increasingly bitter critic of the plant and Japan's entire energy policy as directed by NISA's powerful government overseer, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. In 2006 Sato was forced to step down and in 2008 was prosecuted and convicted on bribery charges. He claims the charges were politically motivated. Following the conviction he wrote a book of his experiences called Annihilating a Governor explaining his concerns about nuclear power and how he was set up and wrongfully convicted. The book was largely ignored until the events of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster sent it rocketing up the bestseller list.

The river then flows northwest through a corner of Benton County and then the breadth of Marshall county to a point just south of the unincorporated community of Barton, where it turns southwest as it enters DeSoto County. Along the Desoto County-Tate County line, the river is impounded by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam to form Arkabutla Lake. From Arkabutla Lake the Coldwater River takes a mostly southerly course, flowing roughly parallel to the nearby Mississippi River, as the Coldwater forms the boundary between Tate and Tunica counties, and then passes through Quitman County to its confluence with the Tallahatchie River south of the town of Marks.

Bioacoustic monitoring of aggression in group-housed rhesus macaques. Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science 9:261‚Äì268. = Poultry Welfare = It is a widespread practice in the poultry industry to induce molting in egg-laying chickens, which maximizes both egg production and hen health. However, the effects of induced molting on hen well-being are poorly understood. The most common method for inducing molting is via forced fasting (fast-induced), and there is growing concern that hen well-being is negatively affected by fast-induced molting. A less popular but promising method of induced molting involves feeding of low- caloric density feed (nonfasting-induced). McCowan et al. (2006) examined the behavior of chickens subjected to different induced molting styles and found that cage pecking, aggression, and gakel calling increased in fast-induced chickens.McCowan B, Cardona C, DiLorenzo AM, Jeffrey J, and Klingborg D. (2006). Effects of induced molting on the well-being of egg-laying chickens. Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science 9:9-23. http://faculty.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bjmccowan/Pubs/McCowanetal..JAAWS.2006.pdf McCowan et al. (2006) concluded that nonfast-induced molting appears to be a more appropriate method, minimizing discomfort during a physiologically stressful time. The data also support gakel vocalization as an indicator of stress/discomfort in chickens, which are notoriously stoic and therefore have been hard to assess for well-being, historically. = Dairy Production = Cows, as with many mammals, use vocal communication to mediate and strengthen strong mother-infant bonds. Calves often call to their mothers in times of need (hunger, danger), and it is believed that certain calls are used to solicit nursing. McCowan et al. (2002) found that playback of calf vocalizations caused a statistically significant increase (1-2%) in milk production in dairy cows.McCowan B, DiLorenzo AM, Abichandani S, Borelli C, and Cullor JS. (2002). Bioacoustic tools for enhancing animal productivity and management: Effects of recorded calf vocalizations on milk production in dairy cows. Applied Animal Behaviour Science 77:13-20. http://faculty.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bjmccowan/Pubs/McCowanetal.AABS.2002.pdf The cows most responsive to the vocalizations were those cows whose actual infants were closest in age to the calves used for the recordings (less than 1 week old); therefore, it is possible that milk production within a dairy herd could be increased further if multiple playbacks of calf vocalizations were used, varying by age as appropriate for the cows (McCowan 2002). (Young calf playbacks to cows with young calves; older calf playbacks to cows with older calves, etc.) These results highlight an innovative non-chemical method for increasing milk production in dairy cows, and are especially important findings for use on organic dairy farms, as the demand for organic products grows.  Wildlife Conservation  Ground Squirrels = Belding‚Äôs ground squirrels (Spermophilus beldingi) are social squirrels living in the western United States which exhibit kin altruism by making alarm calls commonly referred to as ‚Äòchirps‚Äô to warn other individuals of terrestrial or aerial predators. Belding‚Äôs ground squirrels live in colonies of related females and their dependent offspring, with the older sons dispersing to find other less-related females‚Äô burrows, and the daughters staying to expand upon their mother‚Äôs current burrow system. McCowan et al. (2002) hypothesized that there is an acoustic variability in these chirps dependent on individual identity, sex, and social group membership which is subsequently important in kin and social group recognition.McCowan B and Hooper SL. (2002). Individual acoustic variation in Belding‚Äôs ground squirrel alarm chirps in the High Sierra Nevada. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 111:1157-1160. http://faculty.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bjmccowan/Pubs/McCowan&Hooper.Jasa.2002.pdf; McCowan et al. (2002) recorded the alarm chirps of eight adult female Belding‚Äôs ground squirrels from four lakes in the High Sierra Nevada mountain range, analyzed the acoustic structure of these chirps, and found the chirps to be individually distinctive, yet with similarity among individuals that may correspond to genetic similarity. McCowan et al. (2002) concluded that analysis of acoustic variation may then be a reliable, noninvasive tool for tracking dispersal patterns and other population dynamics in this species, as well as in other more threatened and endangered vocal mammalian species. = Humpback Whales = The effects of anthropogenic noise caused by ships, sonar, and other manmade systems on marine mammals have received increasing attention in recent years by environmental organizations, governmental agencies, and the general public. Such noise is potentially disrupting the feeding and mating behavior of marine mammals which rely on vocal communication and echolocation. After recording over 50 hours of vocalizations from 100 humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) in Glacier Bay National Park over 5 years, McCowan et al. (2008) introduced a quantitative tool, based on information theory, that can characterize and quantify humpback whale responses to environmental boat noise.Doyle L, McCowan B, Hanser S, Bucci T, Chyba C, and Blue E. (2008). Applicability of information theory to the quantification of responses to anthropogenic noise by Southeast Alaskan humpback whales. Entropy 10:33-46. http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/10/2/33/pdf The researchers conclude that use of this new tool has the potential to help determine the effects of boat noise on humpback whale vocal communication and population dynamics, and may also be used to evaluate anthropogenic noise effects on other wildlife populations. = Mexican Spotted Owls  Behavioral Ecology of Infectious Disease  Ground Squirrels = Domestic Livestock = Mastitis, a potentially fatal inflammatory infection of the mammary glands, is a common health problem in dairy cows in the United States and causes great economic losses for the dairy industry each year due to reduced milk production in cows with mastitis. While the influence of contagious gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus) ‚Äì which used to be the primary cause for mastitis in dairy cows ‚Äì has been significantly reduced in recent years, environmental pathogens such as coliform bacteria (e.g. E. coli) and noncontagious Streptococcus now play a larger role in the infection of dairy cows. This is cause for concern as environmental bacteria, noncontagious Streptococcus especially, are becoming increasingly resistant to antimicrobial intramammary therapy. McCowan et al. (2005) set out to determine if certain housing facilities, husbandry practices, and/or use of antimicrobial agents caused higher levels of resistant environmental bacteria.Kirk JH, McCowan B, Atwill ER, Glenn KS, Higginbotham GE, Collar CA, Catillo A, Reed BA, Peterson NP, Cullor J. (2005). Epidemiology and antibiotic resistance of ‚Äúenvironmental Streptococci‚Äù isolated from bulk tank milk collected on California dairies. Journal of Dairy Science 88:3710‚Äì3720. The researchers sampled the bulk tank milk of nearly 100 California dairies and conducted a face-to-face on-site questionnaire for approximately 50 of the dairies found to have at least 3 environmental bacteria isolates. McCowan et al. (2005) analyzed the results and found that not drying udders before attaching the milk units significantly increased chances of antimicrobial resistance, as did the use of some antimicrobial agents (ceftiofur, Sulfadimethoxine) for treatment of non-mastitis diseases. Surprisingly, no antimicrobial agents used to treat mastitis were found to cause increased resistance.  Socio-Cognitive Complexity / Communication Complexity  Bottlenose Dolphins = Squirrel Monkeys = Squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) are highly social New World monkeys found in Central and South America which exhibit various alarm calls to warn other individuals of potential predators. McCowan et al. (2000) researched the role of learning in the development of chuck call recognition in squirrel monkeys, hypothesizing that monkeys at different developmental stages (ages) respond preferentially to the chuck calls of familiar ‚Äì yet genetically unrelated ‚Äì companions as compared to those of unfamiliar individuals.McCowan B and Newman JD. (2000). The role of learning in chuck call recognition by squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus). Behaviour 137:279-300. http://faculty.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bjmccowan/Pubs/McCowan&Newman.Beh.2000.pdf; The researchers conducted a controlled playback experiment on four different age classes of squirrel monkeys and found that infants did not appear to have any preference for the chuck calls of close social associates or other social group members, concluding that learning plays a role in chuck call recognition in squirrel monkeys and that infants gradually learn to acoustically recognize social companions within their group. To warn others in highly threatening situations, squirrel monkeys use an alarm call known as an alarm peep. In a later study, McCowan et al. (2001) examined the role of learning in the development of response to alarm peeps.McCowan B, Franceschini NV, and Vicino GA. (2001). Age differences and developmental trends in alarm peep responses by squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus). American Journal of Primatology 53(1):19-31. http://faculty.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/faculty/bjmccowan/Pubs/McCowanetal.AJP.2001.pdf The researchers again conducted a controlled playback experiment on four different age classes of squirrel monkeys, and found that adult females were more discerning in their responses to alarm peeps, preferring to trust the peeps of other adult females as opposed to the peeps of infants or juveniles. The researchers concluded that squirrel monkeys do learn more appropriate responses to alarm peeps over their first year of development.

This term is used to highlight the difference in treatment between members of different groups when one group is intentionally singled out and treated worse, or not given the same opportunities. Attitudes toward minorities have been marked by discrimination historically in the United States. Many forms of discrimination have come to be recognized in U.S. society, on the basis of national origin, race, gender and sex in particular. History=Racism most public places were segregated. Colorism is a form of racially-based discrimination where people are treated unequally due to skin color. It initially came about in America during slavery. Lighter skinned slaves tended to work indoors, while dark skinned worked outdoors. In 1865, during the Reconstruction period after the Civil War, the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed and it abolished slavery. This was soon followed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution that granted citizenship to all persons \\"born or naturalized in the United States\\", and the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution that protected the rights to vote for everyone. These Amendments passed during the Reconstruction period extended protection to the newly emancipated slaves. However, in the 1870s Jim Crow laws were introduced in the Southeastern United States. These laws promoted the idea of \\"Separate but equal\\" which was first brought about from the Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896, meaning that all races were equal, but they had to have separate public facilities. The mixing of races was illegal in most places such as public schools, public transportation and restaurants. These laws increased discrimination and segregation in the United States. Oftentimes, the products and sections designated for the \\"Colored\\" were inferior and not as nice for the \\"White Only\\". Water fountains, bathrooms, and park benches were just a few of the areas segregated by Caucasians due to Jim Crow laws. Furthermore, the Jim Crow laws systematically made life harder for African-Americans and people of color. It made voting harder to accomplish, due to the fact that African-Americans had to do literacy tests and go through other obstacles before getting the chance to vote. In the modern United States, gay black men are extremely likely to experience intersectional discrimination. In the United States, the children of gay African-American men have a poverty rate of 52 percent, the highest in the country. Gay African- American men in partnerships are also six times more likely to live in poverty than gay white male couples. In August 2020, the US Justice Department argued that Yale University discriminated against Asian candidates on the basis of their race, a charge the university denied. Fighting back Major figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and Rosa Parks were involved in the fight against the race-based discrimination of the Civil Rights Movement. Rosa Parks's refusal to give up her bus seat in 1955 sparked the Montgomery bus boycott‚Äîa large movement in Montgomery, Alabama that was an integral period at the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement. The Bus Boycott lasted a total of 381 days before the Supreme Court deemed that segregated seating is unconstitutional. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a peaceful activist and pastor, led many such protests, advocating for the improvement of African-Americans in American's society. His role in the Montgomery Bus Boycott helped to launch his role in the Civil Rights Movement. King organized many protests attended not only by African-American, but also Caucasians. While King organized peaceful protests, Malcolm X went a different route. His main supporters, The Nation of Islam, and he stressed the idea of black power, and black pride. Although Malcolm X's actions were radical, especially when they contradicted that of Dr. King, but he is still considered one of the pioneers in fighting back against racial discrimination in daily life and not just from a political standpoint. His ideas of black nationalism and the use of violence to fight back helped to spark the political group in the Black Panther Party for Self- Defense, which later became known as the Black Panther Party. Formed by Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton, the organization was created in October 1966, in Oakland, California. Usually seen in all black and armed, as a group, the Black Panthers first started off patrolling police activity in Oakland, but soon grew to widespread support in cities like Los Angeles, and Chicago. Although they were seen as a violent gang and a danger to society, the Black Panthers brought numerous social programs such as free breakfast for school children and free clinics across numerous cities. What the Black Panthers were fighting for was outlined in their Ten-Point Program. They were ultimately taken down by the FBI, led by J. Edgar Hoover, in the early 1970s. Other factors such as internal tensions, and financial struggles also played into the demise of the Black Panther Party and by 1982 they were completely gone. In the education system, the Civil Rights Movement further became huge after the ruling of Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. Oliver Brown challenged the Board of Education of Topeka, Kanas when his daughter was not allowed to enroll in any of the all white schools claiming that \\"separate but equal\\" violates the protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Ruby Bridges, along with the Little Rock Nine, dealt with discrimination from Caucasian peers, their parents, and the community in general during the desegregation of schools. The Little Rock Nine were a group of nine African-American students who volunteered to attend school at the Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. They continuously had problems with the public and faced harsh treatment from other students, parents, and even the Little Rock National Guard. However, a change occurred when President Dwight D. Eisenhower intervened by sending federal troops to escort the students. For Ruby Bridges, she joined the Civil Rights Movement in the November 14, 1960 when she became enrolled in William Frantz Elementary School. Due to many parents not allowing their children in her class, Bridges was in class by herself, which was taught by Barbara Henry, and oftentimes ate alone and had recess alone. Ruby, along with her family, did face a lot of backlash throughout Louisiana from the desegregation; however, they did receive support from numerous people in the North and Bridges was able to finish the year. Contemporary society=Gender discrimination Gender discrimination is another form of discrimination. Women have made claims that they are often seen as an expense to their employers because they take days off for children, need time off for maternity leave and may be stereotyped as \\"more emotional\\". The theory behind this is known as the glass escalator or the glass ceiling, which holds that while women are being held down in male-dominated professions, men often rise quickly to positions of authority in certain fields. Some women believe that men are being pushed forward into management, even surpassing women who have been at the job longer and have more experience in the field in some cases. Men's rights deals with discrimination against men in the areas of family law, such as divorce and child custody, labor such as paternity leave, paternity fraud, health, education, conscription, and other areas of the law such as domestic violence, genital integrity, and allegations of rape. Discrimination against immigrants rightImmigrants to the United States are affected by a totally separate type of discrimination. Some people feel as though the large numbers of people being allowed into the country are cause for alarm, therefore discriminate against them. Arizona recently passed a law that forces people to carry documents with them at all times to prove their citizenship. This is only one controversy over immigrants in the United States, another is the claim that immigrants are stealing \\"true Americans'\\" jobs. Immigration restrictions are among the biggest government interventions in the economy. They prevent millions of people from taking jobs, renting homes, and pursuing a wide range of opportunities that they could otherwise have. Violent hate crimes have increased drastically. Recent social psychological research suggests that this form of prejudice against migrants may be partly explained by some fairly basic cognitive processes.For more, see According to Soylu, some argue that immigrants constantly face being discriminated against because of the color of their skin, the sound of their voice, the way they look and their beliefs. Many immigrants are well educated, some argue that they are often blamed and persecuted for the ills in society such as overcrowding of schools, disease and unwanted changes in the host country's culture due to the beliefs of this \\"unwelcomed\\" group of people. According to Soylu, there was an open immigration policy up until 1924 in America until the National Origins Act came into effect. According to the Immigration Act of 1924 which is a United States federal law, it limited the annual number of immigrants who could be admitted from any country to 2% of the number of people from that country who were already living in the United States in 1890, down from the 3% cap set by the Immigration Restriction Act of 1921, according to the Census of 1890 It superseded the 1921 Emergency Quota Act. The law was primarily aimed at further restricting immigration of Southern Europeans and Eastern Europeans. According to Buchanan, later in the 1930s with the advent of opinion polling, immigration policy analysis was carried out by collecting public thoughts and opinions on the issue. These factors encouraged a heated debate on immigration policy. These debates continued even into the 2000s, and were intensified by George W. Bush's immigration proposal. Some argue that the 9/11 terrorist attacks left the country in a state of paranoia and fear that strengthened the views in favor of having closed borders. =Discrimination in the workplace= Immigration to the United States can be difficult due to immigrants' lack of access to legal documents and the expensive nature of immigration. The United States has historically been a major target destination for people seeking work and continues to be so today.. As Graciela, a 47-year-old married woman who had lived in the US for 4 years, stated, ‚ÄúMy husband,... he lost his job. Things were beginning to get tough... We came with the need to find work and better life possibilities.‚Äù Worldwide, the workforce has become increasingly pluralistic and ethnically diverse as more and more people migrate across nations. Although race- or ethnicity-based discriminatory employment practices are prohibited in most developed countries, according to feminist scholar Mary Harcourt, actual discrimination is still widespread. Sahagian Jacqueline, an author, argues that one example of this act of discrimination occurred at Macy's a department store. According to the U.S. Justice Department, Macy's used unfair documentation practices against legal immigrant employees who had proper work authorizations. During an eligibility re-verification process, Macy's broke immigration law that prohibits employers from discriminating against immigrant employees during re-verification by asking for more or different documents than other employees are required to submit based on a worker's immigration status or national origin. Some of the affected employees lost seniority, were suspended, or even let go due to the illegal re- verification. While their opinions are controversial, researchers Moran, Tyler and Daranee argue that with immigrants' growing numbers and their expanding economic role in U.S. society, addressing challenges and creating opportunities for immigrants to succeed in the labor force are critical prerequisites to improve the economic security for all low-wage working families and ensure the future vitality of our economy. Discrimination based on sexual orientation Another type of discrimination is that against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. For personal reasons such as religious beliefs, employers sometimes choose to not hire these people. LGBT rights have been protested against for various reasons; for example, one topic of controversy related to LGBT people is marriage, which was legalized in all states in June 2015 following the Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges. On June 15, 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia and two other cases, that workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is covered by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

He performs with his band ‚Äî Cayetano Live Band ‚Äî and as a DJ worldwide. Biography Ever since Bratanis was very young, he was involved with several indie bands and at the same time he was studying music. In 1995 he was a member of the popular band \\"Stroggylo Kitrino\\" (The Round Yellow). They released two albums, \\"Stroggylo Kitrino\\" in 1996 and \\"O Ksenos\\" (The Stranger\\") in 1999 from the legendary \\"Lazy Dog Records\\". In 2000 he started travelling all over Europe and then stayed in Barcelona, Spain, until 2004. There he worked with several Spanish groups as a pianist and a bassist, toured with them in Spain, wrote music for theater and cinema, and made the dub-triphop-jazz oriented \\"Cayetano\\" project. His first album, Mr. White, was released in vinyl from the German label Kinky Lounge in 2001. Another album, Cayetano, followed in 2003 from the same label. It was the time that Cayetano started to be well-known on the European scene. In 2004 he went back to Greece and made Sala Sonora Records. In 2006 he released from his own label, the Focused album, which made him well-known to the public. He toured all over Europe, and the album was voted as one of the best albums of 2006 in more than 30 major radio stations in 14 countries. In the same year and because of this album, Cayetano was nominated for the French award, \\"Prix Radiophonie\\". In 2008 Cayetano signed with the label Etage Noir, and produced Loopa Scava's album Loopa Scava meets Cayetano - Up and Down, which was a success on the underground trip hop scene. This brought him to the top of the European scene, and the press was putting him near to big artists such like Bonobo and Wax Tailor. In the meantime he did remixes for well-known artists such like Tailor, Parov Stelar, Timewapr Inc., Ancient Austronauts. In 2009 he released The Big Fall album (Etage Noir). His appearance in major festivals gave him the reputation he needed and he got numerous sold out gigs, his tracks are on the most popular compilations and programs on TV. In October 2010, Cayetano signed with Klik Records and released the album Back Home two months later. Four months after the release, the 'Back Home Tour' begun. On October 8, 2012, Cayetano released, \\"Once Sometime\\" whilst the remixed version of the album was released on January 13, 2014 on Klik Records new sub-label, Pale Sound Records. He appeared on the same stage with artists such as Bonobo, Parov Stelar, Dj Krush, Alice Russell, Koop, Dj Bootsie, DJ Food, DJ Shadow, Kormac, Karuan and Morcheeba  Cayetano Live Band  In 2006, Cayetano formed the \\"Cayetano Live Band\\" right after the release of the Focused album, with 11 musicians on stage. Nowadays, the band consists of six musicians on stage and one FOH technician. =Current members of Cayetano Live Band= *Giorgos \\"Cayetano\\" Bratanis (samplers, keyboards, vocals, programming) *Georges Perin (vocals) *Dimitris Tselios (saxophone, flute) *Alex Papoulidis (guitar) *John Bell (bass) *Thomas Kostoulas (drums, percussions) *Leo Beilis (sound engineer) =Former members of Cayetano Live Band= *Themis Veleni (vocals) *Christos Manuel (vocals) *Tasos Peltekis (guitar) *Cherry Piker (guitar) *Yannis Stolakis (percussions) *Alex Archodis (drums) *Ilias Girbas (saxophone) *Dimitris Dalezis (trumpet) *Giorgos Aggelakis (trombone)  Cayetano as a DJ  Cayetano is known for his DJ sets in which he combines dub with Latin and funky grooves.

History  The Maddingley brown coal deposit was surveyed by the 1930s. In the early 1940s brown coal was mined and transported in large quantities by rail from the nearby Rowsley Station, with dedicated trains running between Maddingley and the Australian Paper Manufacturers (APM Siding) at Fairfield, Melbourne. The coal was used to fire boilers at the APM paper mill, with 400 tonnes (440 short tons) of coal per day transferred in two trains per day. This traffic continued until the late 1970s when the boilers were converted to natural gas firing.S Cauchi (November 1994). \\"Closure of the Australian Paper Ltd siding at Fairfield\\". Newsrail (Australian Railway Historical Society (Victorian Division)): pages 328‚Äì331 From the 1970s to the late 1980s coal from the mine was used to fuel local boilers at the CRA/Visy cardboard manufacturing facility located at JBD Business Park, located adjacent to Rowsley Station. The cardboard plant was decommissioned by 1990. The mine was subsequently acquired by the Calleja Group transport company primarily as a dump for green waste. By 1994 the Calleja Group had acquired ownership of a methodology to create densified coal. The company invested in the application of Maddingley brown coal as a soil conditioner and natural fertiliser replacement for super phosphate, and the development of bench test equipment to produce batch samples of densified coal. Around 1997 the working technology to achieve densified coal became known as the Coldry Process.

History On 27 October 1480 Botticelli, together with other Florentine painters, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Cosimo Rosselli, left for Rome, where he had been called as part of the reconciliation project between Lorenzo de' Medici, the de facto ruler of Florence, and Pope Sixtus IV. The Florentines started to work in the Sistine Chapel as early as the Spring of 1481, along with Pietro Perugino, who was already there. Detail of the fresco The theme of the decoration was a parallel between the Stories of Moses and those of Christ, as a sign of continuity between the Old and the New Testament. A continuity also between the divine law of the Tables and the message of Jesus, who, in turn, chose Peter (the first bishop of Rome\\"Peter, St. \\" F. L., Cross, The Oxford dictionary of the Christian Church, Oxford University Press, 2005) as his successor: this would finally result in a legitimation of the latter's successors, the popes of Rome. Botticelli, helped by numerous assistants, painted three scenes. On 17 February 1482 his contract was renovated, including the other scenes to complete the chapel's decoration. However, on 20 February, his father died: he returned to Florence, where he remained. Description The Temptations of Christ depicts three episodes from the gospels, in parallel with the painting on the opposite wall, also by Botticelli, showing the Trials of Moses. A frieze, similar to that beneath the other frescos, has the inscription TEMPTATIO IESU CHRISTI LATORIS EVANGELICAE LEGIS (\\"The Temptations of Christ, Bringer of the Evangelic Law\\"). The subject of the title takes place in three scenes in the upper section of the fresco. On the left, Jesus, who has been fasting, is tempted by the Devil, in the guise of a hermit, to turn stones into bread. In the second scene of temptation, at the upper centre of the picture, the Devil has carried Jesus to the top of the temple of Jerusalem, represented by the facade of the Chapel of Santa Maria in Traspontina of the Church of Santo Spirito in Sassia in Rome. The Devil tempts Jesus to challenge God's promise that he will be protected by angels, by throwing himself down. In the third temptation, to the upper right, the Devil has taken Jesus to a high mountain where he shows him the beauties of the Earth. The Devil promises Jesus power over this domain, if he will deny God and bow down to the Devil. Jesus sends the Devil away from him, while angels come to minister to him. In the foreground, a man whom Jesus has healed of leprosy presents himself to the High Priest at the temple, so that he may be pronounced clean. The young man carries a basin of water, in which is a bough of hyssop. A woman brings two fowls for sacrifice and another woman brings cedar wood. These three ingredients were part of the ritual of cleansing of a leper. The high priest may symbolize Moses, who transmitted the Law, and the young man may symbolically represent Christ, who, according to the Gospels, was wounded and slain for the benefit of mankind, and healed through the Resurrection so that mankind might also be made spiritually clean, and receive salvation. In Christian symbolism, many stories, such as the healing of the leper, are perceived to prefigure the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus, or other events in his life.

It is located in Piazza Affari (\\"Business Square\\"), the city square after which the Italian stock exchange itself is nicknamed. The name \\"Palazzo Mezzanotte\\" is a reference to Paolo Mezzanotte, the architect who designed the building. History The original stock exchange of Milan was established in 1808 in the seat of the Mount of piety of the city. The following year it was moved to the Palazzo dei Giureconsulti, in Piazza Mercanti, and at the beginning of the 20th century it was relocated again in a newly constructed building in Piazza Cordusio; this building now houses the headquarters of the Poste Italiane postal service, and has thus been renamed Palazzo della Posta (\\"Post Palace\\"). The plaque showing the plan of the Roman theatre found during the excavations for Palazzo Mezzanotte In 1925, the city authorities of Milan launched a project for a new, larger building for the stocks exchange. Architect Paolo Mezzanotte began his design in 1927, and construction works began in 1929. The ruins of a Roman theatre were discovered during the excavations, and this delayed the construction. A plaque showing the map of those ruins is now affixed on one of the outer walls of the palace. The building was completed in 1932. At its inauguration, it qualified as the most technologically advanced building in Italy; it was the first building to implement a single call button controlling several elevators, it had air conditioning, and housed the largest electric display of the times (in Italy) where stock quotations where updated in real time. The building has a monumental, 36 m high facade, in a style that mixes 20th- century architecture and Neoclassicism; it is realized in marble and travertine and decorated with sculptures by Leone Lodi and Geminiano Cibau. The main room of the Palace, called \\"sala delle grida\\" (\\"cries room\\") as businessmen would shout their offers to buy and sell, is lighted by a large net, affixed to the ceiling, which reproduces the constellations in the celestial sphere. Since the 1990s, all business is done remotely via the network, and the room has lost its original function; it is now mostly used to house conferences.

Mineralogy, British Museum, June 7 1951 Taaffeite, a new beryllium mineral, found as a cut gem- stone. Retrieved February 2015 As such, it is the only gemstone to have been initially identified from a faceted stone. Most pieces of the gem, prior to Taaffe, had been misidentified as spinel. For many years afterwards, it was known only in a few samples, and it is still one of the rarest gemstone minerals in the world. Since 2002, the International Mineralogical Association-approved name for taaffeite as a mineral is magnesiotaaffeite-2N'2S. Discovery Taaffe bought a number of precious stones from a jeweller in October 1945. Upon noticing inconsistencies between the taaffeite and spinels, Taaffe sent some examples to B. W. Anderson of the Laboratory of the London Chamber of Commerce for identification on 1 November 1945. When Anderson replied on 5 November 1945, he told Taaffe that they were unsure of whether it was a spinel or something new; he also offered to write it up in Gemologist. Specimen from Ratnapura, Sri Lanka Properties In 1951, chemical and X-ray analysis confirmed the principal constituents of taaffeite as beryllium, magnesium and aluminium, making taaffeite the first mineral to contain both beryllium and magnesium as essential components. The confusion between spinel and taaffeite is understandable as certain structural features are identical in both. Anderson et al.,Anderson, B.W., Payne, C.J., and Claringbull, G.F., (1951) Taaffeite, a new beryllium mineral, found as a cut gemstone. Mineralogical Magazine 29, pp. 765‚Äì772 classified taaffeite as an intermediate mineral between spinel and chrysoberyl. Unlike spinel, taaffeite displays the property of double refraction that allows distinction between these two minerals. Usage Because of its rarity, taaffeite is used only as a gemstone. Formation and occurrence Taaffeite occurs in carbonate rocks alongside fluorite, mica, spinel and tourmaline. This extremely rare mineral is increasingly found in alluvial deposits in Sri Lanka and southern Tanzania, as well as lower grade taaffeite in limestone sediments in China.

He is associated with the Albanian National Awakening and its ideals. He worked for the movement during the Albanian Declaration of Independence and continued after that event. He was always proud to be Albanian and so was inspired for a long time in his extensive patriotic and artistic activity. During all his life he fought for the independence of Albania. Birthplace and his artistic inspiration He was born in Lavdar (center of commune of Opar) on 15 June 1861. In that time Kor√ßa was well known for the rich heritage of the popular art of Byzantine culture of the period of David Selenica. The area where he grew up, was a very attractive source for this artist. His education was not based on artistic studies but all of the techniques of paint he was able to absorb by practice and observation, achieving to create very expressive and originals figures. The beautiful nature of his native land and people, brave and hardworking, let strong impressions in the memory of this young man and became later primary models in his beautiful patriotic tableaus, portraits and compositions and other masterly reproductions from nature and photos. When he was 14 years old he was joined by his father, and left with many other compatriots to Istanbul. He went three times to Istanbul but there he did not acquire any property and never forgot his native country, that beautiful and gorgeous nature where the warriors of freedom used to repose. Painter‚Äôs technique The beautiful art of paint and the first brush speckles he made, were in the restoration of The Blue Mosque and other churches in Istanbul. There he had contacts and a very profitable experience from many professional explorers of paint art and contemporaries in the world. New viewpoints were opened to him after the visits he paid to the art galleries of Istanbul, Vienna, Belgrade and Athens. From there he brought the oil technique, oil colors, and his first creations together with his impressions. We find paintings of this artist painted on plywood, tin, silk and pig leather. He also knew the technique of murals. He also did wood models (ships) and tapestries. From where he took the basics of form and color? From our evidences it is clear that he took them from three methods: models and photography, iconography and nature. He did not study about iconography but he left proof of 15 icons in the Art Museum, Kor√ßa. The portrait in the painter‚Äôs work Portraits and especially those taken in original are the first creations of his life. These take an important place in the rich creativity of the paint not only for their spitting image but also their expression. He painted coeval, relatives and personalities from well known traditional families in Kor√ßa. To mention are: Parashqevia, Aount Qyrana, his self-portrait exposed in Gallery of Arts in Tirana and of his family and the portrait of a priest of Marianit. In other countries there are also portraits of Woman in Istanbul, Patriarch of Istanbul, Valiu of Monastery and also that one of Sovran Ahmet Zog, the King (2.4 m x 1.7 m). Composition A preferred genre of the painter is composition. By observation of some famous work of romanticism and European expressionism of 1920‚Äì1925 he made some erotic and lyric paintings such as ‚ÄúDancing of the nymphs‚Äù, ‚ÄúChildren and the angel‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe handsome boy and nymphs‚Äù and ‚ÄúLove Arrow‚Äù. Friend of warriors for freedom After his return to Albania he became friend of patriots who started to work for the liberation of the country. He was friend of Kajo Babien, and also of Mihal Grameno, member of the warriors group of Themistokli Germenji and member of the government after the Declaration of Korca as independent Region. He was a member of the group of delegates participating in the independence of the country from Ottoman Empire and the creation of the government of Ismail Qemali. He supports the democratic revolution led by Fan. S. Noli contributing with votes of people in the area of Opar. Paintings=Tableau of band of Shahin Matraku One of the most conspicuous works is the ‚ÄúWarriors of Shahin Matraku‚Äù. This painting is part of the treasure of the National Gallery of Arts in Tirana and it may be considered as a masterpiece of the author. It is unique and of great value characterized by a romantic theme and a patriotic inspiration. This is considered as the Pearl of Albanian art and the most prominent painting till the middle of the 20th century. Tableau of war of Mesolongj At the center of this tableau are the brave warriors Marko Bo√ßari, Foto Xhavella and many others Albanians fraternized with Greeks fighting against ottomans in the Greek revolution of 1821. This paint shows the energy of the movements and details of the traditional wear of that period. Figure of Skenderbeg Spiro Xega is the only Albanian painter of that time who painted patriotic themes. He treated the figure of our national hero Skenderbe in 15 pieces. It is very obvious the dynamism of the movements of the hero and also of his horse. There is a perfect harmony of bended streaks of sword, kilt, beard and hair flowing backwards because of the intensive action of the hero in the battle. A very symbolic particular we can notice are the clothes of the hero where we see the north Albanian wear combined with south Albanian wear, short woolen jacket and kilt symbolizing the unification of Albanian country. This paint is always present in the illustrations of the Albanian history school books. Also another symbolic painting is the portrait of Donika Kastrioti the wife of the hero, as a perfect Albanian woman dressed with a national costume. First drawing course in Albania Taking part in different patriotic unions he opened the first course of drawing in Kor√ßa. His first students were those who later became a very successful generation of painters as Guri Madhi, Vangjush Tushi etc... Generally they used to work in graphics using carbon pencils and taking different models. Paint and photography There are known connections of the painter Spiro Xega with talented patriotic photographs Kristo Sulidhi in Korca and Kol Marubi in Shkod√´r. They have had a very reciprocal collaboration. From Kristo Sulidhi he took the different positions of warriors and from Marubi he took portraits and the typical dresses of the north as woolen jackets, jerkins, pistols kept in belt etc. This is seen also on the figure of Skenderbeu of the year 1936. Creativity of Spiro Xega as a national treasure Counting about 137 paint works as portraits, compositions, tableau, quiet nature, created a real artistic ensemble which for a long time and now continue to affect the development of figurative arts and patriotic and artistic education of Albanian people. He used to expose his paints in his private shop. Before the liberation of the country in 1944 he participated at three different exhibitions where he was very appreciated. In the year 1956 he opened an exhibition of all of his works in Tirana and his works were highly appraised. His home had always been a home gallery and was visited by Albanians and foreigners (we can mention here the Russian producer Ilia Kopain and the artist Akaki Khorava, of the famous movie of Sk√´nderbeu, who depicted the figure of Sk√´nderbeu on the creativity of the painter Spiro Xega. The artistic and genetic inheritance of the painter The painter Spiro Xega, left us a rich and unique legacy through his paintbrush. His artistic creativity has a variety of works such as graphics, oil, mural, icons. There are approximately 137 pieces of different genres which are part of our national art culture in museums and in Albanian families in and out Albania. His relatives in the USA got a number of his paints, which are of a great value. We can say that the painting skills of Spiro still runs in the blood of the Xega family. His nephew Ilia Xega has participated successfully in many regional exhibitions, his grand nephew Dhimitri Xega has continued also to inherit successfully the art of painting and is enriching even more the artistic treasure of the paintings in Xega Family.

Using litigation, it tries to hold state and non-state actors responsible for egregious abuses. It was founded in 2007 by Wolfgang Kaleck together with a group of human rights lawyers, in order to help protect the rights guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as other declarations of human rights and national constitutions, by juridical means. ECCHR engages in litigation, using European, international, and national law to help protect human rights.  Topics and Focus  ECCHR initiates, develops, and supports high-impact, strategic human rights litigation to hold state and non-state actors accountable for the violations of the rights of the most vulnerable. ECCHR works on cases that illustrate and highlight important legal and social problems, recognizing that human rights violations are committed in specific contexts with a view to achieving certain financial, social, military or political goals. ECCHR actively litigates cases and but also researches, investigates, and helps to coordinate the development strategies of legal advocacy around cases. The organization conducts it work within a network of partner organizations, lawyers and those affected by concrete human rights violations. ECCHR's work focusses on cases in the following areas:  International Crimes and Accountability  The International Crimes and Accountability Program aims to ensure that grave breaches of international law - war crimes, torture and other crimes against humanity - are prosecuted and perpetrators are brought to justice. ECCHR is focusing its work on the following countries and themes: * War crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated for example in Syria, Sri Lanka, Colombia and Argentina *Grave human rights violations committed in the course of countering terrorism by the USA, the UK and their allies in Guant√°namo, Iraq and Afghanistan as well as through drone strikes * Grave human rights violations including torture and sexual violence in Yemen, Colombia, Syria and Congo * Dealing with the crimes of the dictatorships in Argentina and Chile (Colonia Dignidad) * NATO and UN responsibility in Serbia and Afghanistan  Migration  * EU's asylum, refugee and migration policies * Unlawful push-backs at the EU's external borders  Business and Human Rights  The Business and Human Rights Program looks at three main areas: transnational corporate activities in authoritarian regimes and conflict zones; working conditions in the global supply chain; and business activities that affect economic and social rights. Areas of focus for the Business and Human Rights Program include: * Cooperation of companies with regimes and conflict parties and their relation to human rights violations (e.g. in Syria, Yemen, Colombia, Argentina) * Inhumane working conditions in the global supply chain in agro and textile industries (e. g. in Pakistan, China, Bangladesh, Qatar) * Access to land and livelihoods (e. g. in Zimbabwe, Peru)  Education  As part of a broader social movement, ECCHR regards it as its obligation to not only take legal action against human rights violations but also to educate coming generations of human rights lawyers. ECCHR's Education Program offers participants a platform for the theory and practice of international human rights law. It aims to develop and further a critical analysis of contemporary issues of law and society. ECCHR claims that since 2008 about 400 human rights lawyers from more than 40 countries have been volunteers or trainees at the organisation. ECCHR organizes conferences and other public events, conducts media outreach, and publishes web-based and print reports and communications to inform the public about grave human rights violations worldwide.

It runs from Schwandorf via Cham to Furth im Wald. It is part of a long-distance connection between Germany and the Czech Republic. History  The Bavarian Eastern Railway Company () received a license from King Maximilian II to build the line on 12 April 1856. The first section from Schwandorf to Cham was opened five years later, on 7 January 1861. The section between Cham and Furth im Wald was opened on 20 September 1861. A month later, on 15 October 1861, the Plze≈à‚ÄìFurth im Wald line reached Furth station, completing a continuous link between Nuremberg and Prague. 15 years after the opening of the line, the Bavarian Eastern Railway was nationalised and the line became part of the Royal Bavarian State Railways. Four branch lines were built, connecting to the line. The first two lines branched off from Cham station, one to Lam (opened in 1891) and the other to Waldm√ºnchen (opened on 1 August 1895). In Bodenw√∂hr Nord the branch to R√∂tz was opened on 3 August 1896 and on 5 November 1907 the branch to Nittenau followed. From 2001, services were operated by Regentalbahn AG (RAG) under the name of Oberpfalzbahn on behalf of DB Regio. After winning the tender let by the Bayerische Eisenbahngesellschaft in 2011, Regentalbahn has been operating this line directly on behalf of the contracting authority since December 2014. In addition to the Regio-Shuttles sets previously operated, Pesa LINK II two-car diesel multiple units would have been used. Due to licensing problems, however, the LINK II sets were not used and Alstom Lint 41 sets, which had been acquired since mid-2016 for other routes of the Oberpfalzbahn network, are used. Due to the low traffic volumes on the Nuremberg‚ÄìPrague route, long- distance traffic was discontinued in 2012 on the route and replaced by long- distance buses. From July to December 2014, the platform of Roding station was moved to the west and a bus stop was built for transfers between buses and trains at the new location. This was done in cooperation between DB Station&Service; and Verkehrsbetrieben Roding. The new island platform is 170 m long and has a platform height of 55 cm above the rail. The previously ground-level platform access was replaced by a pedestrian overpass, so no passenger safety measures are now required. Route  The line leaves Schwandorf station and passes under the A 93 autobahn to the east. In the Wackersdorf area, the Upper Palatinate lakeland lies to the right of the line; these lakes have been developed since 1982 from the excavations created by the mining of brown coal. From Altenschwand the line runs through the Upper Bavarian Forest Nature Park (Naturpark Oberer Bayerischer Wald), passes through the Tax√∂lderner forest and reached the former Bodenw√∂hr railway junction, where the now disused railway line to R√∂tz branched off. The line to Nittenau, which is now used only for freight, also branches off in Bodenw√∂hr. The line then runs through Neub√§uer forest and meets the Regen river near Roding and follows it to Cham. Near Chamm√ºnster the line branches off the line to Lam to the north east and follows the Chamb through the Cham-Further depression to Furth im Wald and continues to Plze≈à. Development stage  The line is entirely single track and non-electrified. In the short term it is planned to carry out small improvements to straighten the line to Plze≈à. There are also proposals to rebuild the line between Roding and Furth im Wald as part of a line known as the Danube‚ÄìVltava railway, a high-speed line between Munich and Prague. Operations  Until the 1970s, most of the traffic on this line was steam-hauled. Several classes of locomotives that were originally built for Bavarian State Railways and Deutsche Reichsbahn were used on the line. Various Czech steam locomotives ran to Furth im Wald. In the 1950s the first diesel locomotive was used on this route. Regio-Shuttle in Kothmai√üling station Regionalbahn services on this line are operated with Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1 diesel railcars. Regional-Express services consist of two DB Regio Bayern train pairs between Nuremberg and Furth im Wald, which are operated with tilting class 612 diesel multiple units. Seven pairs of express trains are operated by alex between Munich and Prague. Rail services on the line are part of the Regionalz√ºgenetz Ostbayern (\\"regional rail network of Eastern Bavaria\\"), which is managed by the Bayerische Eisenbahngesellschaft (\\"Bavarian Railway Company\\"), with operations run under contract. Regentalbahn won the most recent tender.

The cast includes Bill Nighy, Rachel Weisz, Michael Gambon, Tom Hughes, Ralph Fiennes, and Judy Davis. The film was followed by Turks & Caicos (2014) and Salting the Battlefield (2014), which were broadcast on BBC Two in March 2014. The three films are collectively known as The Worricker Trilogy.BBC press release, 3 May 2013: Bill Nighy to reprise his role in The Worricker Trilogy Linked 2014-03-01  Plot summary  Johnny Worricker (Bill Nighy) is a long-serving MI5 officer. His best friend and superior, director general Benedict Baron (Michael Gambon), summons Johnny to a meeting with MI5 agent Jill Tankard (Judy Davis) and Home Secretary Anthea Catcheside (Saskia Reeves) regarding a potentially explosive report. Worricker verbally highlights a note at the foot of page eight alleging that Prime Minister Alec Beasley (Ralph Fiennes) has knowledge of secret overseas prisons where terror suspects have been tortured by American authorities. If true, Beasley did not share any intelligence gained with the security services, at the possible expense of British lives. At the same time, Johnny begins spending time with his neighbour Nancy Pierpan (Rachel Weisz), a Syrian-born political activist whose brother was killed by the Israeli military. Johnny shares his love of modern art and jazz with Nancy but, wondering if she aims to exploit his connections, asks friend and covert intelligence operative Rollo to investigate her. Meanwhile, Baron dies of a heart attack at his country home before he can make the report public. Beasley orders the report to be buried and tells Johnny of his plans to replace MI5 with a U.S.-style Homeland Security organisation. Catcheside's silence is bought by naming her Deputy Prime Minister. Johnny sells a painting from his small but valuable art collection to obtain traveling cash. He learns that an acquaintance of Nancy's, seen loitering around the apartment building, is Tankard's son and has been paid to monitor him. Johnny realizes that Beasley and Tankard are running a politicised \\"cowboy\\" intelligence operation. Johnny gives Nancy a copy of the secret file on her brother's death but points out that he would be implicated if its existence were to be revealed by her. Johnny ends up making a deal with Tankard to keep quiet about the report. In return for Johnny's silence, Tankard agrees to kill the reorganisation of the intelligence services as well as leak the file on Nancy's brother's murder to the BBC. The fallout forces Johnny to disappear for his safety. Johnny gives Nancy a Christopher Wood painting from his collection. On seeing the leaked report of her brother's murder on the news, she realises that Johnny arranged it to allow her to pursue a legal case against the Israelis without implicating himself. At London Stansted Airport, Johnny dumps the original report incriminating Beasley in a rubbish bin. As Johnny looks at the departure screen, Nancy looks closely at Johnny's painting and sees a church near a beach.

The system referred to a practice of giving millions of pesos to chiefs of staff when they retire. An estimated PHP1.5 billion in AFP funds were allegedly placed anomalously in an unaudited pool of discretionary resources. Under the system, AFP general Carlos Garcia was alleged to have plundered PHP303 million as head of the comptroller's office while former AFP chief of staff Angelo Reyes was alleged to have received PHP50 million as send-off money. The scandal led to the recommendation of filing of plunder charges against six retired generals and five other officers. The Philippine Department of Justice named the following in its recommendation to the Office of the Ombudsman: AFP chiefs Roy Cimatu and Diomedio Villanueva; retired military comptrollers Garcia and Jacinto Ligot; retired major general Hilario Atendido; former brigadier general Benito de Leon; retired lieutenant colonel Ernesto Paranis; active-duty officers Cirilo Tomas Donato and Roy de Vesa; former civilian auditor of Divina Cabrera; and former accountant Generoso del Castillo.  Background  The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) was embroiled in a corruption scandal in early 2011 after its former budget officer George Rabusa testified in a Senate Blue Ribbon Committee of the ' (send-off money) system. The ' system refers to the money given to a retiring chief of staff as send-off money. The money used for system was derived from funds which were diverted to retiring chiefs of staff. The way the money was diverted was uncovered by Commission on Audit auditor Heidi Mendoza when she testified on a House of Representatives Committee on Justice. Generals Jacinto Ligot and Carlos Garcia, who were the AFP's comptrollers when the system was in place, were detained; however, the Office of the Ombudsman went into a plea bargaining agreement with Garcia, in the government withdrew their cases against him as they contended the evidence was weak. Rabusa testified that all of the AFP chiefs of staff were recipients of send-off money; they all denied knowingly receiving such send-off money. Angelo Reyes, one of the accused recipients, committed suicide as he was compelled by Congress to testify on the matter. Rabusa's testimony The House Committee on Justice and Senate Blue Ribbon Committee conducted hearings on the plea bargaining agreement of the Office of the Ombudsman and retired General Carlos Garcia who has a plunder suit in the Sandiganbayan (special court for government officials). On January 26, retired Col. George Rabusa exposed the alleged ' or send-off system in the military, which gives at least PHP50 million (USD1.1 million) to retiring chiefs of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). Rabusa said he gave not less than 50 million pesos to Gen. Angelo Reyes when he retired. On January 30, Rabusa further said that former AFP chiefs of staff Diomedio Villanueva and Roy Cimatu were also given send-off money. The payoffs, done monthly, were also given to vice, deputy and secretary to the joint chiefs of staff. Rabusa had been given by his comptrollers, Jacinto Ligot then Carlos Garcia, discretion on how to utilize the provisions for command-directed activities (PCDA), and these were given as send-off money to the generals. On the next Senate Blue Ribbon Committee hearing, Rabusa said that he delivered at least PHP160 million to Garcia, who ordered him to withdraw PHP10 million 16 times. Rabusa concluded that Garcia should have given it to Villanueva. Rabusa, who had kept copies of the Security Bank receipts, did so before the Anti-Money Laundering Act was put into force. Rabusa also included all AFP chiefs of staff, from his appointment as budget officer from 2000 until he left office as recipients of the alleged send-off money. Rabusa also admitted that he pocketed PHP50 million when he was still a budget officer from 2000 to 2002, and that wives of the generals were also given money. Representative Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo issued a statement that she did not have anything to do with the alleged corruption in the military. Five of the chiefs of staff, Narciso Abaya, Dionisio Santiago, Generoso Senga, Hermogenes Esperon, and Alexander Yano, denied receiving money, and denied that their wives used government money to spend o their overseas trips. As a result of Rabusa's allegations, Senate President pro tempore Jinggoy Estrada (who presented Rabusa as a witness in the hearings), asked Ligot on the subsequent hearing, on his wife's alleged 42 overseas trips from 1993 to 2004; the retired general refused to answer and Estrada summoned Ligot's wife Erlinda at the next hearing. Rabusa also revealed that former Representative Prospero Pichay had been given PHP1.5 million on his three visits at Gen. Villanueva's office. Pichay subsequently filed libel raps against Rabusa. Villanueva, whose wife had just died, and Cimatu, who was then serving as special envoy to the Middle East, appeared on the Senate to deny that they received send-off money; Cimatu testified that his ' were his 40 medals and citations as a soldier. Cimatu's executive assistant, Brig. Gen. Benito de Leon, admitting receiving millions of pesos from Rabusa, but insisted that the transaction was legal. Rabusa replied that de Leon's statement was a \\"total lie.\\" Mendoza's testimony On a hearing of the House of Representatives Committee on Justice on late January 2011, former Commission on Audit (COA) auditor Heidi Mendoza testified that she uncovered irregularities in funds by the military. Among the irregularities she found was the 200 million peso AFP Inter-Agency Fund, and the US$5 million United Nations (UN) reimbursement for Filipino peacekeepers. The AFP fund was split into three bank accounts: 50 million and 100 million pesos on United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) Alfaro Street, Makati, and another 50 million pesos at UCPB Tordesillas, Makati. The accounts on the Alfaro branch were covered by deposits slips while the account on the Tordesillas branch was not recorded, despite the existence of a passbook. The UCPB Tordesillas branch manager wrote to Mendoza that there was a \\"cover-up\\" by the military in the transfer of the UN fund. While the PHP200 million originated at the AFP's trust fund at the Landbank EDSA-Greenhills branch was split into three accounts, the missing PHP50 million at the UCPB Tordesillas branch was a fresh deposit. In the case of the missing US$5 million, the United States Department of Justice legal attach√© asked her if she can be allowed to audit the UN reimbursements, as a certain US$5 million which was personally picked up by a military officer in New York was not reflected in the military's accounts. Former COA chairperson Guillermo Carague disapproved Mendoza to go to New York to investigate on the matter. Two more accounts by the military, one each at General Santos and Iloilo City, which were used as clearing accounts for the UN funds, were discovered by Mendoza. Mendoza testified that Carague's orders on not to pursue the cases disheartened her; Carague, Mendoza said, was given by orders from the executive department, probably from the Executive Secretary.

The neighborhood is bounded by the Avenue de Clichy, the Avenue de Saint-Ouen and the boundaries of Paris in the North. History Epinettes were part of Batignolles, an independent village outside Paris, until 1860 when the emperor Napoleon III annexed it to the capital. An agricultural area until the middle of the 19th century, it then evolved into an industrial district, with several factories such as those of Ernest Go√ºin. Housings were built in typical Parisian style, with a majority of Haussmannian buildings. The Cit√© des Fleurs, a picturesque pedestrian street with small houses with gardens in the heart of the city, is also built at that time. Statue in the Square des √âpinettes Like the neighbouring Batignolles, Epinettes, especially the south-western part (Brochant & La Fourche) was strongly linked to impressionism. The \\"groupe des Batignolles\\" met in Caf√© Guerbois or at Chez le p√®re Lathuille, avenue de Clichy. Famous writer √âmile Zola lived also in the district, as did painter Alfred Sisley in the Cit√© des Fleurs (City of the Flowers) or poet Jules Laforgue. Several famous left-leaning politicians or activists from the turn of the 20th century came from Epinettes: Paul Brousse or Maria Deraismes. Famous singer Fr√©hel also grew up there. It was also influenced by industrial paternalism, especially of Edme-Jean Leclaire or Ernest Go√ºin. Even though industries left the district as they did in the rest of Paris, its population has long been mostly middle class. It has evolved towards gentrification or embourgeoisement in French, as some sociologists or newspapers noted. Real estate prices have strongly grown, especially in the South-Western part between the Avenue de Clichy, the Avenue de Saint-Ouen and the Rue Guy M√¥quet.Michel Pin√ßon et Monique Pin√ßon-Charlot, Sociologie de Paris, Editions La D√©couverte, 2004¬´ Sur la piste des bonnes affaires ¬ª, Le Figaro, 20 October 2010Les Epinettes, conservatoire d'architecture  Places  In the Epinettes district you can see the square des √âpinettes, the Cit√© des Fleurs and the cimeti√®re des Batignolles (Andr√© Breton, Paul Verlaine, Blaise Cendrars, Ray Ventura or Benjamin Peret are buried there.

History The work was mentioned in 1648 by writer and painter Carlo Ridolfi as a large panel commissioned in memory of Venetian politician and diplomat Pietro Cappello; he described it as \\"one of the most beautiful and delicate by the artist\\". It is Bellini's first work in which the influence of Giorgione is undeniable, starting the last phase in the artist's career, a tonalist one Description The work is set in a large niche, depicting a sacred conversation within an established scheme: the Madonna and Child enthroned, a musician angel on a step and four saints placed symmetrically at the sides. They are St. Peter the Apostle, St. Catherine of Alexandria, St. Lucy and St. Jerome. While the general ensemble is not different from previous works, such as the San Giobbe Altarpiece (which shares the apse with mosaics, for example), Bellini introduced some novelties, such as the side openings with landscape, inspired by Alvise Vivarini Battutii Altarpiece, once in Belluno (now lost). The colors and light show the new adherence of Bellini to Giorgione's color and mood style. The egg above Mary's head is a symbol of the creation, perhaps a citation of Piero della Francesca's Brera Altarpiece. The lucerne below recalls Andrea Mantegna's San Zeno Altarpiece.

The structure is a stainless steel tower with a fiberglass hut within the framework, carrying a lantern. History The construction of an automatic lighthouse on Y Reef was approved by the Commonwealth Lighthouse Advisory Committee on 18 August 1937. This caused some confusion since a light was already present at the similarly named Wye Reef, to the south. The light was eventually constructed by the Public Works Department in late 1938, in difficult conditions.

He served in the Parliamentary army in the English Civil War. Biography Carter was the second son of Thomas Carter of Denton, Buckinghamshire. He is said to have been apprenticed to a linen-draper, probably in London. During the Civil War he joined the Parliamentary army where he distinguished himself as a Parliamentary officer. As Lieutenant Colonel Carter, he was sent with forces from London to reinforce General Middleton and landed in Pembrokeshire in August 1644. After marching to join Middleton's army in Cardiganshire he then accompanied him to North Wales. He was one of General Mytton's Commissioners to receive the surrender of Carnarvon Castle on 4 June 1646. He settled at Kinmel and became one of the most powerful men in Denbighshire. The Committee of both Houses ordered him to continue as Governor of Conway Castle on 17 July 1647. He was appointed a Commissioner for pious uses for the use of the Corporation of Denbigh on 17 November 1648 and was Constable of Conway Castle from 23 June 1649 to 15 February 1661. In 1649 he was appointed Sheriff of Caernarvonshire, and was appointed a Commissioner of Sequestration in North Wales on 18 February 1650.

It is also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, primarily in the context of Late Antiquity, while the Roman Empire was still administered with separate eastern and western political centres. In its own time, there was no such thing as \\"the Byzantine Empire,\\" there was just the ongoing Roman Empire; \\"Byzantine Empire\\" is a scholarly term of convenience to differentiate the empire from its earlier existence during classical antiquity before the western half collapsed (see decline of the Roman Empire). Its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire (, Basileia Rh≈çmai≈çn;. ) or Romania (). After the Western Roman Empire fragmented and collapsed in the 5th century, the eastern half continued to thrive, existing for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During much of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. The Eastern Roman Empire (purple) and its vassals (pink) in 555 AD during the reign of Justinian I. The vassals are the Kingdom of Lazica and the Abasgians (top), and the Ghassanids (east).

The film is an intimate look at a group of young American men who join the Michigan Army National Guard, their families, and the town they come from. Director Heather Courtney follows these young men closely, as they transition from small town teenagers to Army guardsmen during the war in Afghanistan. Their story continues to follow the 23-year-old veterans dealing with the less visible wounds of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and PTSD. It premiered at South by Southwest festival, where it won the best documentary editing award. In 2012, the film won a News & Documentary Emmy Award for Outstanding Continuing Coverage of a News Story (Long Form), as well as the Truer Than Fiction Independent Spirit Award. Plot Motivated by a variety of reasons from college tuition support, to a sense of purpose, best friends Dominic and Cole join the Army National Guard after graduating from their rural high school. After persuading several of their friends to join them, the young men are sent to Afghanistan as part of the 107th Engineer Battalion, 168th Engineer Brigade, where they are tasked with searching for roadside bombs in order to keep roads safe for other troops. By the time their deployment ends, they are no longer the carefree group of friends they were before enlisting; repeated bombs blasts around their convoys have led to TBI symptoms, and they have become increasingly disillusioned about their mission. Coming home is no relief as they are now confronted with the silent war wounds of PTSD and TBI. The soldiers struggle with reintegration with society and some miss the simplicity in life they had while in Afghanistan. The latter half of the documentary focuses on their struggles on the home front and how each of them, and their families try to return to normal life. Reception The film received almost universal critical acclaim following both its theatrical release and its national broadcast on the award-winning PBS series POV.

Lauren Wissot of Slant Magazine criticized the film for being \\"too unsurprising in its universality\\" also saying it felt like left-wing propaganda. Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times criticized the film's lack of focus, stating that \\"despite the film's unvarnished emotionality and even-handed messaging, Courtney never seems to have found an appropriate focus, resulting in a work that's less urgent and involving than its intense subject matter might have dictated.\\" Goldstein also noted that the soldiers featured in the film were depicted as lacking \\"charisma, warmth, or depth,\\" which hampered investment in their journey. Distribution The film had a small theatrical release in Fall 2011, as well as a national broadcast premiere on the PBS series POV in November 2011 and an encore broadcast in September 2012.

The dam is multi-purpose and was constructed for flood and ice control along with irrigation, hydroelectric power generation and navigation. Construction began in 1957 and was completed in 1960. It is the first major water control project on the Yellow River and was viewed as a major achievement of the new People's Republic of China. Subsequently, its image was printed on the country's bank notes. However, due to sediment accumulation in the reservoir, the dam later had to be re-engineered and renovated. The effects from sediment, which include flooding upstream, have placed the dam at the center of controversy and criticism-related arrests by the Chinese government. History In response to centuries of flooding on the Yellow River, engineers initially proposed the Sanmenxia Dam in early 1935. In 1954, the Yellow River Planning Board was established and oversaw a survey of the river with help from Soviet engineers. The Soviet engineers recommended a dam at the Sanmenxia site. Original plans for the dam called for a maximum reservoir level above sea level (ASL). This would have required the relocation of 870,000 people and the flooding of . The design was revised to a maximum level of ASL which required the relocation of 400,000 people and flooded much less area. In 1955 the Comprehensive River Basin Planning Report officially proposed the project. The report was submitted to the National People's Congress and swiftly approved that same year while preliminary construction began soon after. Under Soviet Union supervision, construction ceremoniously began on 13 April 1957. Construction on the left-bank cofferdam began in June 1957 and excavation was completed a year later along with the pouring of the left-bank foundation. In October 1958, construction on the right-bank cofferdam was initiated and the river was closed by November 1958. In June 1960, the reservoir was at full pool and the dam crest reached its design elevation of ASL in April 1961. The dam's generators were commissioned between 1973 and 1975. The dam was the first major water project on the Yellow River and constructed with manual labor. Upon completion, it was hailed as an engineering success for the new republic and its image was printed on Chinese banknotes. Sediment and renovation Downstream face of dam in 2007 Soon after completion, sediment-accumulation threatened the benefits of the dam. The Yellow River carries more sediment than any other in the world. During the 18 months after the river was closed, 1.8 billion metric tons of sediment had accumulated in the reservoir. Only 7% of the sediment-load was released downstream and the reservoir lost 17% of its capacity below a ASL elevation. Navigation and farmland were threatened upstream along with the relocation of an additional one million people. Despite the dam's 12 deep-sluices and alterations in the release of water, silt continued to build in the reservoir, particularly in the back waters. Responding to the potential crisis, a meeting was held in December 1964 with Premier Zhou Enlai. At the meeting, it was decided to reconstruct the dam's outlet works for improved discharges and silt control. The renovation was carried out immediately and in two stages. The first stage included the installation of two tunnels on the dam's left bank at an elevation of ASL along with converting four penstocks into flushing pipes. The flushing pipes began operating in 1966 and the tunnels in 1967 and 1968. In the second stage, eight bottom sluices were added to the left side of the dam which became operational between 1970 and 1971. Silt balance was achieved in 1970. Two more bottom sluices began operating in 1990 along with another in 1999 and the final in 2000. Controversy and arrests Impacts from sediment accumulation continued after renovation and also drew increasing criticism. The sediment has caused severe flooding on the Wei River upstream. Chinese engineer Zhang Guangdou described the project as a \\"mistake\\" in 2004 and remarked how hydrologist Huang Wanli had been sent to hard labour for opposing the project. Other engineers oppose the dam's existence but their silence is attributed to government reprisals. In August 2010, Chinese journalist Xie Chaoping was detained for writing The Great Migration, a book that criticized the dam and the government's handling of it. The next month, the book's printer, Zhao Shun, was also arrested. Xie was later released on bail. Design The dam is a tall and long concrete gravity type. It sits at the head of a catchment area and withholds a reservoir with a capacity. The reservoir covers a surface area of and stretches upstream to Longmen. The dam supports a power station that can hold up to eight turbines but currently only seven are installed. Five 50 MW and 75 MW Francis turbine-generators make up the arrangement for a total installed capacity of 400 MW.

The film is based on a 1942 football match between German soldiers and their Ukrainian prisoners of war during World War II, known as the Death Match, though in the film, the prisoners of war are Hungarian labour servicemen. The film won a critics' award at Boston Cinema Festival 1962. Two Halves in Hell was remade as the 1981 American-British film Escape to Victory, this time with the prisoners of war representing a diverse group of countries. In addition, the 1974 film The Longest Yard, about an American football game between prisoners and their wardens, has been compared to Two Halves in Hell; The Longest Yard has been remade three times.  Plot  It is the spring of 1944. Nazi officers want to organize a football match for Hitler's birthday, in which Germans would play against Hungarian labour servicemen of war. They call for the famous Hungarian footballer, √ìn√≥di, and order him to organize a team. √ìn√≥di accepts, but in turn demands extra food, a ball with which he and his team can train before the match, and asks that they be allowed to concentrate on training before the match and not work. The Germans accept all the demands, but recommend √ìn√≥di not include any Jews in his team. However, √ìn√≥di can't organize the team only from his labour battalion, because only 8 out of 98 servicemen can play football. Therefore, √ìn√≥di recruits players from the other battalion. One of the players is Steiner, who is a Jew and can't play football. He lied to √ìn√≥di because he was afraid to die. During training the footballers subdue the Hungarian gendarmerie guarding them and try to escape. They are soon recaptured and told they will now probably face the death penalty. However, the Hungarian officer orders the Hungarian team to still play the match. At the beginning of the match √ìn√≥di and his team are discouraged, as the Germans easily score three goals. The Hungarians succeed in scoring one goal and the first half ends 3-1 in favour of Germany.

The first lineup of the group consisted of Jimmy Paulson (lead vocals, guitar), Greg Lovell (guitar), Brent Saunders (bass) and Jeff Ramirez (drums). Ramirez was soon replaced by Rob Cunningham and the band released their debut album entitled Marvel in 1993. After signing with Mercury Records, The Lemons released a self-titled EP in 1994. The same year, Cunningham was replaced by Nabil Ayers, while Paulson departed the band in 1995 and was replaced by Jeff Hiatt, with Lovell taking up lead vocals. They released their second and final album entitled Sturdy in 1995, before disbanding the following year. History=Formation and Marvel (1991‚Äì1993) When Greg Lovell, originally from Florida, moved to Washington from California, met Jimmy Paulson, they decided to form a band, adding bassist Brent Saunders and drummer Jeff Ramirez to the lineup in 1991, with Paulson on lead vocals and sharing guitar duties with Lovell. They played local shows, opening for acts such as the Supersuckers and the Dwarves, before parting ways with Ramirez. They soon successfully auditioned drummer Rob Cunningham, after he put an ad in The Rocket, and began recording their debut album three weeks later. They continued to play live, including shows opening for Meddaphysical and Bathtub Gin, before signing a deal with independent record label Macola Records in 1993. Released in the same year and produced by Al Sieg, Marvel was described as \\"a speedy album that owed more to the bratty '80 pop-punk of the Descendents and All than the currently fashionable sludgy grunge sound\\" by Allmusic review Stewart Mason, though he criticized Seig's production. Major-label deal, Sturdy and breakup (1994‚Äì1996) The Lemons signed a deal with Will Records before signing with Mercury Records in 1994, releasing a self-titled EP the same year. They recorded their new album with Bill Stevenson, of the Descendents. producing. However, the label rejected the album, with Cunningham departing the band, joining Flake, and guitarist Nabil Ayers joining as their new drummer, making his first appearance with the band when they opened for Mudhoney later in the year. They decided to re-record their second album with Ayers, however Paulson departed the band, temporarily joining Best Kissers in the World before forming New American Shame, with Johnny Reidt, in 1998. Adding guitarist Jeff Hiatt to the group, Lovell became the group's lead singer and re-recorded their second album. Released in 1995, Sturdy sold poorly resulting in the band being dropped from the label a month later. The following year, The Lemons disbanded. Post-breakup activities and one-off reunion (1996‚Äìpresent) Ayers went on to join Alien Crime Syndicate forming the record labels Collective Fruit and The Control Group to release the albums Dust to Dirt, XL from Coast to Coast and Ten Songs in the Key of Betrayal with the band.

Existence of algorithms for this construction proves that the set of œâ-regular languages and B√ºchi automata are closed under complementation. This construction is particularly hard relative to the constructions for the other closure properties of B√ºchi automata. The first construction was presented by B√ºchi in 1962.. Later, other constructions were developed that enabled efficient and optimal complementation..... B√ºchi's construction B√ºchi presented a doubly exponential complement construction in a logical form. Here, we have his construction in the modern notation used in automata theory. Let A = (Q,Œ£,Œî,Q0,F) be a B√ºchi automaton. Let ~A be an equivalence relation over elements of Œ£+ such that for each v,w ‚àà Œ£+, v ~A w iff for all p,q ‚àà Q, A has a run from p to q over v iff this is possible over w and furthermore A has a run via F from p to q over v iff this is possible over w. By definition, each map f:Q ‚Üí 2Q √ó 2Q defines a class of ~A. We denote the class by Lf. We interpret f in the following way. w ‚àà Lf iff, for each state p ‚àà Q and (Q1,Q2)= f(p), w can move automaton A from p to each state in Q1 and to each state in Q2 via a state in F. Note that Q2 ‚äÜ Q1. The following three theorems provides a construction of the complement of A using the equivalence classes of ~A. Theorem 1: ~A has finitely many equivalent classes and each class is a regular language. Proof: Since there are finitely many f:Q ‚Üí 2Q √ó 2Q, ~A has finitely many equivalent classes. Now we show that Lf is a regular language. For p,q ‚àà Q and i ‚àà {0,1}, let Ai,p,q = ( {0,1}√óQ, Œ£, Œî1‚à™Œî2, {(0,p)}, {(i,q)} ) be a nondeterministic finite automaton, where Œî1 = { ((0,q1),(0,q2))  (q1,q2) ‚àà Œî} ‚à™ { ((1,q1),(1,q2))  (q1,q2) ‚àà Œî}, and Œî2 = { ((0,q1),(1,q2))  q1 ‚àà F ‚àß (q1,q2) ‚àà Œî }. Let Q' ‚äÜ Q. Let Œ±p,Q' = ‚à©{ L(A1,p,q) q ‚àà Q'}, which is the set of words that can move A from p to all the states in Q' via some state in F. Let Œ≤p,Q' = ‚à©{ L(A0,p,q)-L(A1,p,q)-Œµ q ‚àà Q'}, which is the set of non-empty words that can move A from p to all the states in Q' and does not have a run that passes through any state in F. Let Œ≥p,Q' = ‚à©{ Œ£+-L(A0,p,q) q ‚àà Q'}, which is the set of non-empty words that can not move A from p to any of the states in Q'. By definitions, Lf = ‚à©{ Œ±p,Q2‚à© Œ≤p,Q1-Q2‚à© Œ≥p,Q-Q1 (Q1,Q2)=f(p) ‚àß p ‚àà Q}. Theorem 2: For each w ‚àà Œ£œâ, there are ~A classes Lf and Lg such that w ‚àà Lf(Lg)œâ. Proof: We will use infinite Ramsey theorem to prove this theorem. Let w =a0a1... and w(i,j) = ai...aj-1. Consider the set of natural numbers N. Let equivalence classes of ~A be the colors of subsets of N of size 2. We assign the colors as follows. For each i < j, let the color of {i,j} be the equivalence class in which w(i,j) occurs. Due to infinite Ramsey theorem, we can find infinite set X ‚äÜ N such that each subset of X of size 2 has same color. Let 0 < i0 < i1 < i2 .... ‚àà X. Let f be a defining map of an equivalence class such that w(0,i0) ‚àà Lf. Let g be a defining map of an equivalence class such that for each j>0,w(ij-1,ij) ‚àà Lg. Therefore, w ‚àà Lf(Lg)œâ. Theorem 3: Let Lf and Lg be equivalence classes of ~A. Lf(Lg)œâ is either subset of L(A) or disjoint from L(A). Proof: Lets suppose word w ‚àà L(A) ‚à© Lf(Lg)œâ. Otherwise theorem holds trivially. Let r be the accepting run of A over input w. We need to show that each word w' ‚àà Lf(Lg)œâ is also in L(A), i.e., there exist a run r' of A over input w' such that states in F occurs in r' infinitely often. Since w ‚àà Lf(Lg)œâ, let w0w1w2... = w such that w0 ‚àà Lf and for each i > 0, wi ‚àà Lg. Let si be the state in r after consuming w0...wi. Let I be a set of indices such that i ‚àà I iff the run segment in r from si to si+1 contains a state from F. I must be an infinite set. Similarly, we can split the word w'. Let w'0w'1w'2... = w' such that w'0 ‚àà Lf and for each i > 0, w'i ‚àà Lg. We construct r' inductively in the following way. Let first state of r' be same as r. By definition of Lf, we can choose a run segment on word w'0 to reach s0. By induction hypothesis, we have a run on w'0...w'i that reaches to si. By definition of Lg, we can extend the run along the word segment w'i+1 such that the extension reaches si+1 and visits a state in F if i ‚àà I. The r' obtained from this process will have infinitely many run segments containing states from F, since I is infinite set. Therefore, r' is an accepting run and w' ‚àà L(A). Due to the above theorems, we can represent Œ£œâ-L(A) as finite union of œâ-regular languages of the from Lf(Lg)œâ, where Lf and Lg are equivalence classes of ~A. Therefore, Œ£œâ-L(A) is an œâ-regular language. We can translate the language into a B√ºchi automaton. This construction is doubly exponential in terms of size of A.

Distribution This species is present in most of Europe, in the eastern Palearctic realm and in the Near East.Fauna europaea It is one of only two UK treehoppers.Nature Spot Habitat These thorn-hoppers inhabit woodlands, beech forests, hedge rows and moderately moist or dry areas. Description The adults reach of length,British BugsCommanster while females are slightly larger. The basic colouration of the stocky body is dark- brown. The large protruding eyes are round and reddish-brown to red. The pronotum is hairy, arched up and pulled back in a long, wave-shaped extension above the wings, with two sharp, ear-shaped lateral protrusions (hence the Latin name cornutus, meaning \\"horned\\"). The legs are very short. The front wings are pale brown and translucent, with evident brown veins.The Penny Cyclop√¶dia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge - Vol. 9 The bizarre horn-like extensions of the pronotum apparently help the camouflage. As a matter of fact, when this insect is at rest on a branch with the legs retracted, it looks like a part of the branch itself. This species is rather similar to Gargara genistae, the second UK species of treehoppers, that lacks the horn-like protrusions, has a shorter extension above the wings and it is associated with broom.Holzinger W.

Both males and females can produce sounds and they are able to jump as orthoptera. After mating at the end of June and early July the females lay several eggs in the stalk of herbaceous plants, on which hatching larvae feed. These \\"treehoppers\\" are polyphagous, feeding on plant juices, which they take with their specially built, piercing-sucking mouth parts. The larvae mainly live on Cirsium, Carduus and Urtica species, while the adult insects prefer Populus, Quercus and Rubus species. They overwinter in the litter layer in the larval stage and have a two-year life cycle.

They began as a solo project of Mark Pickerel while he was still a member of Truly. Following the disbanding of Truly, Pickerel turned his project into a band, enlisting guitarist Jesse Roberts and bassist Mike Elkins in 1997. They released their self-titled debut album in 1999 and their second album entitled Goodbye Crooked Scar in 2001, both through Up Records, before disbanding. History=Formation and self-titled debut album (1990‚Äì1999) Musician Mark Pickerel had previously been the drummer of Seattle rock band Screaming Trees, playing on their first five studio albums, before departing the band in 1991. He formed Truly with former Soundgarden bassist Hiro Yamamoto and former Storybook Krooks singer Robert Roth, who also performed guitar duties, in 1990 and continued with the group following his departure from the Screaming Trees. It was during Pickerel's time in Truly that he formed The Dark Fantastic as a solo project. Following the release of Truly's last album, Pickerel added guitarist Jesse Roberts and bassist Mike Elkins to the lineup, to turn the solo project into a band, in 1997. With producer Martin Feveyear, they began working on their debut album, with Pickerel's former Screaming Trees bandmate Van Conner contributing bass to the songs \\"Wind Forever\\" and \\"As You Were Leaving.\\" For the recording of the album, Feveyear also contributed keyboards while Pickerel handled vocals, drums, percussion and additional guitars. Released through Up Records, The Dark Fantastic was met with positive reviews. Reviewing for Allmusic, Becky Byrkit stated that Pickerel is \\"still as much the brisk indie guitar player and risk-taker as before\\" and that \\"the tunes are generally fine even-handed melodies, with some crunchy, button-punching studio technics [...] plus some liberally atomized melancholia just to keep you serious.\\" M. Tye Comer, of CMJ commented that Pickerel \\"leans heavily on dark and dusty Southwestern forms, but he also dabbles in Brian Wilson-esque pop, sludgy indie rock\\" and \\"Gary Numan-inspired synth pop\\" and that The Dark Fantastic \\"is an impressive debut, spearheaded by a soulful, season musician.\\" Goodbye Crooked Scar and disbanding (2000‚Äì2001) Pickerel did session work for a number of musicians, Neko Case and Jim Carroll among others, before beginning work on The Dark Fantastic's second album. Working again with Martin Feveyear, the album featured additional vocals by Vanessa Veselka. Released in 2001, The Dark Fantastic's second album entitled Goodbye Crooked Scar was met with positive reviews. Charles Spano, reviewing for Allmusic, commented that \\"Goodbye Crooked Scar focuses that psychedelia on hard desert rock with a wholly unique Far Eastern vibe\\" and that \\"Mark Pickerel sings like Brian Wilson chanting beautiful eulogies for lost loves and lives,\\" while he also complimented Roberts' and Elkin's contributions to the album. Reviewing for PopMatters, Eden Miller stated that \\"The Dark Fantastic brings maturity to their angst- filled music\\" describing the album as \\"elegantly melancholy\\" and that \\"Goodbye Crooked Star is an unexpected surprise.\\" By the end of the year, The Dark Fantastic disbanded. Following the disbanding of the group, Pickerel released his debut studio album Snake in the Radio in 2006, credited as Mark Pickerel and His Praying Hands, and the follow up Cody's Dream in 2008. Musical style The Dark Fantastic's music has been described as dark, haunting, psychedelic desert rock drawing influences from Pink Floyd, Echo & the Bunnymen and Neko Case. Pickerel also gained a number of comparisons to Brian Wilson for his vocals.

In 1948 the school was bought by Norman Hale who was Headmaster for fifty-one years. Pupils at Milbourne Lodge subsequently win scholarships and places at major independent schools, such as Eton College, Harrow School, Winchester College, Charterhouse, Wellington College, St Paul's School, The Royal Grammar School and Wycombe Abbey. Over the past twenty-five years, pupils have won more than one hundred academic scholarships to Eton, St. Paul's and Winchester. In 2007 Milbourne Lodge became part of the Cognita group. The present head is Judy Waite.

The microphone was designed and patented by the BBC in the 1950s and was originally known as the STC 4038. The sound of the microphone has been described as \\"British\\" with a \\"BBC politeness\\", and its appearance has been likened to that of a waffle iron. It is used in both sound recording and radio broadcasting.  History  The microphone was designed by the BBC in 1953 and the prototype was assigned the model number BBC PGS/1. It was designed as a result of the BBC's request for a strong and affordable microphone that was smaller than previous models (such as the Type A). The 4038 was an improvement on the Type A's frequency response, and was described as \\"less obtrusive\\". The microphone was produced by Standard Telephones and Cables before their manufacturing was transferred to Coles in the mid-1970s. Since its design in the 1950s, the technical specifications of the 4038 have remained unchanged.  Use = Recording  In recording environments, the 4038 is often used as drum overheads and on brass instruments. The microphone became a favourite of British recording engineers in the 1950s and 60s, but did not receive widespread use in the United States. The microphone was described as recording sounds \\"bigger than life\\" - such as drums or amplified guitars - some Beatles and Led Zeppelin recordings featured 4038s as overhead microphones on the drum kit. In a 1994 interview, Steve Albini said that \\"if [he] owned one mic, this would be it\\". Albini has also commented that \\"really nothing beats them as an overhead on a drum kit\\".  Broadcast  At one point, Bush House (home of the BBC World Service) used the 4038 almost exclusively.  Technical  The 4038's frequency response is flat, with a range of approximately 30-15,000 Hz. The attenuation of high frequencies reduces sibilance on vocals, but also reduces detail. The microphone uses a bi-directional polar pattern. The microphone is connected using a Western Electric jack connector designated 4069, which adapts the microphone's 3-pin output to a standard XLR connector. ;Sensitivity (at 1,000 Hz Open Circuit Voltage): -65dB re: 1 Volt/Pa ;Impedance: 300 ohms ;Produced: 1950s-present  Footnotes  Sources  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  Further reading  * Category:Microphones ","title":"Coles 4038"},{"id":"31684166","text":"Oklahoma Governor's Council on Physical Activity and Sport is a council within the office of the governor of Oklahoma for the purpose of . In cooperation with the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition, originated in 1991 by Executive Order of then Governor David Walters.  History  The Oklahoma Governor's Council on Physical Activity and Sport was established by Executive Order under then Governor Henry Bellmon in 1988 under Executive Order 91-10.OGCPFS The Honorable Mary Fallin continued the council in full force under Executive Order 2011-10 on April 8, 2011 in which she credits former Governor David Walters.Executive Order 2011-10 The Oklahoma council stemmed from the national initiatives of fitness established by then President Dwight D. Eisenhower. General Eisenhower's program, \\"President's Council on Youth Fitness,\\" resulted from a n international study that reported American children were less fit than children of other nations. John F. Kennedy furthered the effort by promoting University of Oklahoma football coach, Bud Wilkinson, to the position of Executive Director and distributing fitness manuals to schools across the country.JKF Library It was President Kennedy's aggressive promotion for national participation that prompted Oklahoma to establish their own council within the Office of the Governor. In 2005 Melissa Johnson, a spokesperson for then President George W. Bush, visited Tulsa to encourage Oklahoma residents to participate in the President's Challenge, an online-based resource for becoming more physically fit. First Lady Michelle Obama renamed the national program to the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition to emphasize the importance of quality nutrition alongside physical activity. The national program continues to promote the President's Fitness Award and operates under the \\"Let's Move\\" campaign, which features co-chairpersons Drew Brees, NFL quarterback and Super Bowl champion, and Olympic gymnast Dominique Dawes.Fitness.gov  Council Objectives  The Council cites the following organizational objectives: *Enlist the active support and assistance of individual citizens, civic groups, private enterprise, voluntary organizations, and others in effort to promote and improve the fitness of all Oklahomans through regular participation in physical fitness and sports activities. *Initiate programs to inform the general public of the importance of exercise and the link which exists between regular physical activity and such qualities as good health and effective performance. *Encourage our State and local governments to emphasize the importance of regular physical fitness and sports participation. *Seek to advance the physical fitness of children, youth, adults, and senior citizens by systematically encouraging the development of community recreation, physical fitness, and sports participation programs. *Develop cooperative programs with medical, dental, and other similar professional societies to encourage the implementation of sound physical fitness practices and sports medicine services. *Stimulate and encourage research in the areas of sports medicine, physical fitness and sports performance. *Assist educational agencies at all levels in developing high quality, innovative health and physical education programs which emphasize the importance of exercise for good health. *Assist recreation agencies and state sports governing bodies at all levels in developing \\"sports for all\\" programs that emphasize the value of sports to physical, mental and emotional fitness. *Assist business, industry, government, and the labor organizations in establishing sound physical fitness programs to elevate employee fitness and to reduce the financial and human costs resulting from physical inactivity.  Programs and events  As of April 2011, the Council promotes two programs across the state of Oklahoma: *Safe, Fit, and Health Kids or \\"Oklahoma Kids 21st Century\\" offers the opportunity for schools to apply for an Olympic athlete to visit their school for a motivational speech on living an active lifestyle. *Oklahoma Healthy and Fit Schools Scorecard enables school administrators, parents, teachers, and general citizens of Oklahoma to complete a questionnaire on a school's promotion of healthy options to students. The self-assessed measurement is taken annually by elementary, middle, and high school categories. Once completed the council offers advice for improvement and may award bronze, silver, or gold recognition based on the overall school score. No measurement guidelines are made available. According to the questionnaire, schools are measured on length of recess, meal offerings, opportunities for extracurricular physical activity, availability of programs to introduce families to physical activity, and physical education standards.OGCPFS  Funding  The council was established as a 501c3 organization through Oklahoma Executive Order 91-10. in According to the 2012 Executive Budget, the Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports receives no state funding.

The usual procedure for appointing the sheriff from 1660 onwards was that three persons were nominated at the beginning of each year from the county and the Lord Lieutenant then appointed his choice as High Sheriff for the remainder of the year. Often the other nominees were appointed as under-sheriffs. Sometimes a sheriff did not fulfil his entire term through death or other event and another sheriff was then appointed for the remainder of the year. The dates given hereunder are the dates of appointment. All addresses are in County Donegal unless stated otherwise. County Donegal was created in 1607.

The present building‚Äîa \\"very impressive and beautifully detailed\\" church in the Gothic Revival style, with a landmark tower‚Äîcombines parts of Arthur Blomfield's 1881 church, wrecked during World War II, and Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel's 1950s rebuild. Two earlier churches on the site, the second possibly designed by Samuel Sanders Teulon, were themselves destroyed earlier in the 19th century. The rich internal fittings include a complete scheme of stained glass by Goodhart- Rendel's favoured designer Joseph Ledger and a 16th-century painting by Ortolano Ferrarese. English Heritage has listed the church at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance. History St Leonards-on-Sea was founded as a new town by builder and speculator James Burton in 1827. It was built on a sloping, well-wooded seafront location just to the west of the ancient port of Hastings, and immediately became a fashionable resort and residential area‚Äîrivalling its larger neighbour by the mid-19th century. Burton founded a parish church on the seafront in 1831 (St Leonard's Church), and another (St Mary Magdalene's Church) opened in 1858. Both catered mainly for fashionable visitors and richer residents: pew rents were charged, for example. The growing town's many artisans, manual labourers, shopkeepers and other working-class people, and the large number of workers brought in to build Burton's new town, had nowhere to worship unless they travelled to the Church in the Wood in Hollington, several miles away. Lady St John (Louisa Boughton), the widow of Sir John Vaughan and St Andrew St John, 14th Baron St John of Bletso, paid for a third church to be built in the town; sittings would be free, so poor people could attend. Christ Church, on the main London Road, opened in 1860. Its new vicar from 1863, Rev. Charles Lyndhurst Vaughan, son of Lady St John, worked hard to advance its influence, and the church became so popular that it was often full. Meanwhile, more residential development was taking place to the north, in an area which became known as Upper St Leonards. As well as building a new, larger Christ Church, Rev. Vaughan founded another church at Gensing Farm in Upper St Leonards. The temporary structure, which cost ¬£2,000 (¬£ as of ), was dedicated to St John the Evangelist and opened on 20 April 1865. The tower is the main surviving structural feature of Arthur Blomfield's building of 1881, which was severely damaged by bombing in 1943. Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel's replacement nave and chancel adjoin the octagonal tower. The iron building, known locally as \\"The Round Church\\", was severely damaged by a storm in October 1866 which destroyed the roof. Rev. Vaughan ensured that it was soon rebuilt, this time in brick: construction finished in July 1867 and a procession from Christ Church to the new building preceded its opening on 6 August 1867. Architect Samuel Sanders Teulon, who built Holy Trinity Church in central Hastings in 1857‚Äì59 and two other churches in Rye Harbour and Icklesham around the same time, has been suggested as the designer. This building only lasted 11 years, though: overnight on 30 November‚Äì1 December 1878, it caught fire and was destroyed. During the 1870s, worship took on a strongly High church, Anglo- Catholic character: Reservation of the Sacrament was kept from 1874, and the Tenebrae was celebrated in the same year. The church was again rebuilt, this time to the designs of Arthur Blomfield, a prolific and \\"distinguished\\" ecclesiastical architect who favoured the Gothic Revival style. His other Sussex churches include the new Christ Church itself; All Souls Church, Hastings; All Saints Church, Roffey; the rebuilt Chapel Royal, Brighton; St Andrew's Church, Worthing; St Luke's Church, Queen's Park, Brighton; St Leodegar's Church, Hunston and St Barnabas' Church, Bexhill. Part of the nave of the 1867 was restored and incorporated into the new building, on which work began in 1880. A year earlier, the link with Christ Church had been broken when the ecclesiastical parishes were separated. Construction was largely complete in 1881, although some work continued until 1884. The final cost was ¬£12,300 (¬£ as of ), and the third St John the Evangelist's Church was consecrated in 1883. The church continued to thrive in the new building, and like its former mother church it became noted for its music: a choir school operated between 1896 and 1927. The church suffered another setback in 1943 when it was bombed during the Luftwaffe's raids during World War II. On 9 February 1943, a bomb passed through the spire and tower and exploded in the aisle, destroying the building. Only the tall octagonal tower and parts of the west wall and baptistery survived. In 1949, a hall built next to the ruins was put into use as a temporary church while another new building took shape behind the tower. Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel, a \\"leading authority on Victorian Gothic architecture\\" who often adopted elements of other styles and took a free-thinking, unconventional approach to church design (as at his St Wilfrid's Church, Brighton), was commissioned. His design, a free interpretation of the Gothic Revival style in red brick and \\"with rich ornament and many mannered details\\", was executed between 1950 and 1954. Most work took place between 1951 and 1952, and the first parts to be reconstructed were the transepts and nave. On 18 May 1951, Princess Elizabeth (now Queen Elizabeth II) laid the foundation stone, and dedication ceremonies were held for the new nave and chancel in 1952 and 1957 respectively. A side chapel and a vestry were built in the 1960s. The original spire, damaged by the bombing of 1943, could not be restored and was removed; the top of the tower was altered and a \\"cap\\" added instead. Architecture The entrance is in the base of the four-stage tower. Arthur Blomfield's church of 1881 was built in his preferred Early English Gothic Revival style, mostly in red brick with some Bath Stone dressings. The arcade-flanked nave had five and a half bays‚Äîan arrangement also seen at Blomfield's St John the Evangelist's Church in Preston Village, Brighton‚Äîa clerestory and a queen post ceiling. The aisles on the north and south sides had brick arches and Bath Stone pillars. The chancel had an organ chamber. The octagonal tower at the southwest corner (a local landmark) rose in four stages, the topmost of which had four bells. The church also had a baptistery. Only the tower and the west wall of the nave survived the bombing in 1943. These remains were incorporated into Goodhart-Rendel's redesigned church, which is also Early English Gothic Revival‚Äîalbeit an inventive interpretation of that style (English Heritage described it as a \\"particularly eclectic mix\\"). Goodhart-Rendel \\"accepted every tenet of Gothic architecture except the pointed arch\\", and his design for this was closer to Gothic principles than any of his other postwar churches (of which a Sussex example is the Friary Church of St Francis and St Anthony, Crawley). Red brick was the chosen building material inside and out, although yellow bricks were used in places as a contrast and diaper patterning is used extensively. The nave still has five and a half bays, but Goodhart-Rendel extended the chancel and inserted transverse arches which were likened by Nairn and Pevsner to a \\"strange bridge\\" crossing it. The damaged spire on the tower was replaced with a low cap, but the pointed-arched louvres with their decorative mouldings and the castellated parapet at the top (bell) stage remain. The entrance is in a porch in the lowest stage. The body of the church is \\"powerfully massed\\" and \\"fortress-like\\", emphasised by its prominent brick buttresses to the aisles. Between each buttress is a lancet window. There are small transepts with dormer windows. The transept roofs are on the same level as the chancel roof and lower than that of the nave. A small bell-turret sits on top of the chancel roof. Inside, the nave and chancel are separated by a round-headed double chancel arch which was to have been flanked by niches‚Äîan unrealised aspect of Goodhart-Rendel's plan. The double arch‚Äî\\"the interior's most powerful feature\\"‚Äîwas intended to support both the vaulted roof and the organ, although the present organ stands in the north transept. It came from St Catharine's College, Cambridge in 1974. The aisles are narrower and less substantial than those in Blomfield's church. The interior walls are mostly of stone coated with plaster and render, and the panelled chancel ceiling is painted. The chancel has a stone floor. Fittings include a 19th-century square-bowled font on a carved marble base, a lectern of the same era, chandeliers and an octagonal pulpit. The stained glass, featuring much white glass, was all designed by Joseph Ledger in 1952, apart from some \\"colourful\\" angels in the baptistery which were provided by a Miss Thompson. These were similar to some of the windows in the old church. Ledger met Goodhart-Rendel while in his 20s and became the architect's favoured stained glass designer. He later became a noted ceramicist. The church has a 16th-century painting of the Adoration of Jesus by Ortolano Ferrarese. Many internal fittings, such as the lectern, choir stalls and fixtures from the Lady chapel, came from Blomfield's church. The church today St John the Evangelist's Church was listed at Grade II* by English Heritage on 14 September 1976. This defines it as a \\"particularly important\\" building of \\"more than special interest\\". As of February 2001, it was one of 13 Grade II* listed buildings, and 535 listed buildings of all grades, in the borough of Hastings. It is one of several listed churches in St Leonards-on-Sea. Christ Church, its former mother church, is also listed at Grade II*, as is St Peter's Church in the Bohemia area of the town; and St Leonard's Anglican church, St Leonard's Baptist Church, the Greek Orthodox St Mary Magdalene's Church, the Roman Catholic Church of St Thomas of Canterbury and English Martyrs and the former St Leonards-on-Sea Congregational Church each have Grade II status. The church serves an area of St Leonards-on-Sea known as Upper St Leonards. Most of the parish lies north of the railway line between St Leonards Warrior Square and West St Leonards stations; the line forms part of the southern and western boundaries. The A2102 London Road, Springfield Road and Sedlescombe Road South form other boundaries with neighbouring parishes. Worship has a High church \\"Open Catholic\\" character. Two services are held on Sunday mornings; morning or evening prayer sessions take place six days a week; and morning services take place on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

Biography Radimir was born in the village of Dobrota in the Bay of Kotor, at the time part of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, to father Vjekoslav and mother Zorka n√©e. Kamenaroviƒá. He attended Gymnasium in Kotor, at the time under the Austro- Hungarian Monarchy, and later enrolled at University in Prague and Vienna. He graduated in 1912 at the University of Vienna Faculty for Soil Culture in the class of dipl.ing. Radimir Karl. As World War I ended in 1918 and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was created, he served as a forestry engineer in Ilid≈æa near Sarajevo. Between 1920 and 1937 he was a forestry engineer in the directorate of forests for the Drina Banovina. In 1938 he was transferred to the same position but in Mostar, for the Littoral Banovina. He stayed there until 1939 when he moved to Zagreb. Between 1939 and 1941 he worked at the Department of Forestry of the Banovina of Croatia as a senior advisor. During World War II, he worked in Zagreb in the laboratories of the company \\"La Roche\\" . In 1945 he was employed at the Ministry of Forestry Zagreb, SFR Yugoslavia as a senior government adviser. He worked there until his retirement in 1950. After World War II he wrote and published many papers on the utilization of forestry by-products, especially resins. As an amateur photographer, he compiled a remarkable collection of photographs of forests and their by-products. He gave the collection to a forestry company \\"≈†ipad\\" in Sarajevo. Unfortunately the whole collection was destroyed during the civil war in the nineties. Drago Radimir's principal occupation was reforestation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. To his merit was the introduction of the Serbian Spruce () in Zagreb's parks and in other parts of former Yugoslavia. Several Sequoia (Redwood) trees on the Croatian and Montenegrin coast were planted by him and his co-workers. In 1962 Radimir was awarded a gold certificate at the College for soil culture in Vienna at the 50th anniversary of his graduation (1912 to 1962). He was a member of the Croatian Mountaineering Association before the Second World War, and the mountain society Zagreb since its inception. As a mountaineer he visited many European mountains, some in North America, photographed them and lectured. He was an associate member and a member of the Forestry section of the Dru≈°tvo in≈æenjera i tehniƒçara (Society of Engineers of Yugoslavia that existed as a single organization between 1945 and 1951; afterwards the Society of Engineers of Croatia). Radimir's first marriage was with to Angela n√©e. Radoniƒçiƒá, and the pair had daughters Vjera (married Popoviƒá) and Nada. Second marriage was with Marija Macoliƒá. He died in Belgrade, SFR Yugoslavia. Selected works * Iskori≈°ƒáivanje ≈°uma. Sporedni u≈æici.
