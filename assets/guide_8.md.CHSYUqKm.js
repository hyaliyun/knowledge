Boulder City High School is part of the Clark County School District. History City Hall was originally the Boulder City Elementary School, completed on September 26, 1932 by the Bureau of Reclamation and operated with Six Companies funds. The building has distinctive brick patterns along the front and end walls and a red clay tile roof; it has been restored on the outside of the building to closely resemble its original appearance. The school was outgrown quickly after its construction. Many additional satellite schools were created throughout Boulder City, such as the basement of Grace Community Church, the American Legion Hall, and Camp Williston buildings. On March 4, 1941, ground was broken for the first Boulder City High School, what is currently City Hall. Before the high school was built, Boulder City High School students were bused to Las Vegas and graduated from Las Vegas High School. The first class to graduate from Boulder City High School was 1942. In 1949 ground was broken for what is today's Boulder City High School located on 5th Street and the end of California, which was followed by Mitchell Elementary School in 1970, Garrett Junior High School in 1979, and King Elementary School in 1991. The yearbook is entitled the Aquila, which is the Latin word for eagle. Administration Principal: Amy Wagner Assistant principal: Daphne Brownsen Dean of students: TJ Steckelberg In August, 2014, Principal Kent Roberts left Boulder City High School to lead Green Valley High School in Henderson, Nevada. Assistant Principal Amy Wagner became the official principal during the 2014-2015 school year. Location Located between 5th Street on the north and Adams Boulevard to the south, Avenue G to the east, and Avenue B to the west, Boulder City High School is located on a 25-acre campus. Traditions The school is known for its annual homecoming parade. In the 1970s BCHS students would go to the top of \\"B\\" hill for a large bonfire to celebrate Homecoming. Prior to that the \\"B\\" was outlined with torches or lanterns so that it could be seen at night throughout the city. \\"B\\" hill now is all residential. Athletics The school competes in the Nevada Interscholastic Athletic Association at the Division 1A Level. It offers 14 sports programs. =Flag Football= Boulder City high school's flag football team is notable for the dominating program and state championship in 2015. Flag football became a CCSD girls sport in the 2012-2013 school year as a winter sport. Unlike other sports, flag football was based on location and region, not by student population. This caused a disadvantage to smaller schools having to play larger schools in the same bracket for the CCSD title. The first season the lady eagles barely missed a play off spot ending with a record of 8-10. In the returning season of 2013-2014, the lady eagles returned 9 varsity players and came back with an undefeated regular season of 18-0 to take the Southeast title. The lady eagles continued on to the Sunrise Championship where they fell to Green Valley 13-18. The lady eagles ended the 2013-2014 season with the record of 20-1, tying Green Valley's record from the 2012-2013 season for the most wins in one season. In May 2014, the first All Star Flag football game was held at Foothill High School. Boulder City had 4 girls qualify to represent the Sunrise Team in the All star game: Jeanne Carmel (quarterback/cornerback), Logan Kanaley (running back/outside linebacker), Jane Nevarez (wide receiver/cornerback) and Kinsey Smyth (wide receiver/safety). Boulder City head coach, Chris Morelli was nominated head coach of the Sunrise Team, leading the Sunrise team to the victory over the Sunset All stars. Returning for the 2014-2015 school year, the lady eagles came back for another dominating season. The Lady Eagles went undefeated again in regular season, to take the Southeast Title and end again with an 18-0 season. Post season the lady eagles continued to move forward in the tournament blanking opponents like Del Sol and Green Valley. The Flag Football team went on to win the Sunrise title against Foothill, beating the Falcons 20-0 and securing their spot in the state game. The state game was located at Del Sol High School where Boulder City played the Sunset Champions, Centennial. There the Lady Eagles beat Centennial 7-6 and ended the season undefeated with a 22-0 record to take the CCSD Championship.

He later had a career as semi- professional player and was last a player for Sholing before he died on 21 November 2018 after a car crash on the A505 road in Cambridgeshire. Super Fakes Documentary In 2006, he was featured on a Sky TV documentary Super Fakes. During the 2004‚Äì05 season, Zarrelli who was a young Italian amateur footballer began sending fake letters and faxes to clubs in Northern Ireland and Wales posing as an Italian football executive who was offering clubs the chance to sign an up-and-coming young professional footballer on a cultural exchange loan from the Italian Football Federation. The letter was signed by an Italian executive named Matteo Colobase; in reality Colobase did not exist and was Zarrelli himself. The faxes stated that the footballer on offer had supposedly played at youth level for clubs such as Sheffield Wednesday and Rangers. In reality Zarrelli was an amateur player who had once played youth team football for A.C.D. Asti but ultimately had never been attached to any of the clubs the letter claimed he had been a part of. He also claimed his brother had previously played for Torino which was also untrue. The first club he contacted was in January 2005, when he approached IFA Premiership side Lisburn Distillery, who eventually were duped into signing him on a short-term deal, but he was released after an underwhelming performance in a friendly against Finn Harps. He then contacted Welsh Premier League side Bangor City in July 2005, who were unaware of his previous exploits in Northern Ireland, but after staying with the club 10 days, manager Peter Davenport contacted Mike Rigg who worked for Zarrelli's supposed former club Sheffield Wednesday. Rigg said that they had never heard of him, equally Glasgow Rangers also confirmed that they had no knowledge of the player ever being on their books and Antonelli Valenti of the Italian Football Federation said Zarrelli's name appeared nowhere on the association's database at any level. Most of the problems started during his time at Bangor, when he requested a wage of ¬£200 a week despite initially stating in one of his letters that his wages would be supplied by the FIGC. Davenport said \\"He was only here for about a week to 10 days. In that time, I checked a bit into his background and it didn't add up. He arrived here with a broken nose, so he never actually played for Bangor. He just took part in one warm-up session. He wasn't anything special.\\" Whilst staying with the club, he stayed in the town's Regency Hotel, owned by one of the club's directors, in which upon his departure, he failed to settle his bill. He also spent a brief spell with Connah's Quay Nomads where he was once again found out. Nomads secretary Bobby Hunter said of Zarrelli \\"He was your stereotypical smooth Italian. He certainly looked the part but he couldn't play to save his life. Our manager Neville Powell wasn't interested in him. I wondered why the Italian FA would want to send the cream of their youth to Connah‚Äôs Quay.\\".http://welsh-premier.com/news.php?ID=3248 He later tried his luck in approaching Welsh Premier League champions Total Network Solutions FC just after they had met Liverpool in the preliminary stages of the UEFA Champions League. \\"We didn't pursue it, we did our homework beforehand\\" said TNS secretary, Ian Williams. He was eventually exposed by the show which covered Zarrelli's story along with that of Ali Dia. The documentary was able to track the fax number Zarrelli had been using to a shop in Asti, Italy round the corner from his parents house. The crew set up a sting operation in London, where they staged a meeting posing as football scouts interested in signing him. Zarrelli showed up and began to talk for several minutes explaining that he had once played for Rangers and Wednesday and had been recently playing for Milton Keynes Dons. Asked about the fake executive Matteo Colobase, Zarrelli said that he was a friend of the family before the interviewer revealed to Zarrelli who he actually was. Zarrelli admitted his deception and later phoned the TV's presenters to sarcastically thank them for making him famous. This recording was played out at the end of the show.  Football career  Since the controversy in 2005 and having it reported in the documentary in 2006, Zarrelli managed to progress to a career in semi- professional football and soon moved to Scotland where he played with Ardeer Thistle and Queens Park, before being loaned out to Irvine Meadow. He then moved back to England in 2010, to play with Northwich Victoria Hucknall Town and Lincoln Moorlands Railway. In September 2012, he signed as a semi- professional footballer for Diss Town and days after his signature, club chairman Dicky Upson said that \\"he will be judged on his footballing ability\\", adding, \\"We are aware of what happened in the past, which was several years ago. The programme is still on YouTube and I have seen it. I have met and spoken with Alex and told him he will be judged on his footballing ability and nothing else at our club\\". In February 2013, he signed on loan for Downham Town. Downham boss Pete Brassett said about his new signing, \\"When I first met Alex he was very honest. He told me all about what has happened in the past. We will move forward and it doesn't really affect me or the club. The past is the past ‚Äì without a doubt he's got his life back on track. Some people would have buried their head in the sand but he's come through it, picked himself back up again, and I respect him for that.\\" In August 2013, Zarrelli joined Long Melford. He later moved on to Erith & Belvedere in January 2014 until the end of the season and would eventually suffer relegation from the Isthman League. Zarrelli joined Eastbourne Town in June 2014, where he signed a short term deal until September. When the deal expired he moved to Sheppey United. He went on to sign for Selkirk FC in the Scottish Lowland League In July 2015 he joined St Cuthbert Wanderers where he helped the Scottish club winning a South of Scotland Football League Treble in the season 2015/16. At the end of that season he joined Boston Town for one game only in order to help them pin the Lincolnshire Senior Cup Final that the Lincolnshire club eventually lost 2‚Äì1. He joined Grimsby Borough in August 2016, but after an unconvincing spell by November he was sent on loan to Heather St John's. In January 2017, Zarrelli then got a move to Corsham Town playing for manager and friend Nigel Tripp; however after turmoil within the club and the sacking of the Manager most of the players left in protest and he was sent on loan to UWE where he scored in the only game played for the club. After an EGM at Corsham Town a new club board extraordinarily reinstalled Tripp as Manager and Zarrelli was recalled from his loan to finish the season at the club helping them to avoid relegation and scoring 2 goals in due course. Zarrelli left Corsham Town by mutual consent a few days after Tripp's resignation at the end of the season. Zarrelli returned to Wales 12 years after the Super Fakes Welsh controversy in an unexpected move and joined Welsh side Port Talbot Town in July 2017. Zarrelli joined Sholing shortly before his death, making one appearance in each of league and cup. Death On 21 November 2018, Zarrelli was killed when his blue Mini Cooper collided head on with a Volkswagen Caddy van on the A505 between Royston and Duxford. Although initially surviving the crash he died from his injuries later on in Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/local-news/alessandro- zarrelli-a505-crash-royston-16275703 Notes # Zarrelli is often incorrectly named in most sources as \\"Alessandro Zarelli\\".

Biography He was born on 24 April 1884 in Dumfries, Scotland. In 1913 he was awarded a PhD by the University of Edinburgh for his thesis \\"Cerebral syphilis a clinical analysis of twenty-six cases, seven with autopsy\\". He co-published with R.D. Gillespie A Textbook of Psychiatry (first edition 1927), which became internationally influential for several decades. A series of lectures he gave in New York, America, were published as Psychopathic states in 1939, and ended up contributing to a narrowing of the public understanding of psychopathy as violently antisocial, though Henderson had described various different types many of which were not violent or criminal.Psychopathic states. Henderson, D. K. New York, NY, US: W W Norton & Co. (1939). 178 pp.Hildebrand, M 2004 The Construct of Psychopathy The Henderson Hospital, a specialist national unit in London set up to manage and treat 'psychopathic' personality disorder, was named after him.Henderson Hospital 1947-2008 He was physician-superintendent in charge at the Gartnavel Royal Hospital in Glasgow from 1921 to 1932. In 1932 he replaced the late Dr George Matthew Robertson as Physician Superintendent of the Edinburgh Royal Hospital, being replaced in turn in 1955 by Dr Thomas Arthur Munro. His textbook on psychiatry has been described as the key to the Glasgow approach to mental illness, and Henderson in turn credited the approach of the influential Adolf Meyer whom he had worked with in America. Henderson also studied for some months in Germany with a key founder of modern psychiatry, Emil Kraepelin, whom he admired but found lacking in sensitivity to patients. He was knighted in 1947 and elected president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1949.Vignette: a doyen of ‚Äòpsychological medicine‚Äô Sir David Henderson Douglas Haldane, 2006. He died on 20 April 1965 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Legacy Henderson taught Donald Ewan Cameron, who also worked at the Gartnavel Hospital, would write an obituary for Henderson in the American Journal of Psychiatry.

In the 1980s, the country suffered from ‚Äúbrain drain,‚Äù with talent leaving Mexico for better economic opportunities in other places in the world. SNI first worked to establish compensation guides to keep researchers in the country, but since has also been involved in the reform of Mexico‚Äôs graduate-level education. Membership in the system is prestigious, especially in Levels II, III, and Emeritus, which require demonstration of significant contributions in research as well as teaching and the promotion of research in Mexico. The organization The Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National System of Researchers) is a governmental agency which promotes and evaluates professional research activity in Mexico. Its objective is to promote and strengthen the quantity and quality of research in Mexico through the evaluation of the work done. It promotes the interests of researchers through social and political work. It is a subsidiary of the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog√≠a (CONACYT) and an integral part of the Sistema de Educaci√≥n Superior y Cient√≠fico in Mexico. The organization has been key in representing academia to the federal government. It works to increase the number of active researchers in Mexico, both by the creation and retention of prominent researchers as well as working to link research to teaching quality in higher education, with a particular focus on the hard sciences. The organization also offers research grants, which as of 2009 totaled over two billion pesos. It is a cornerstone of the higher education system in the country, and is authorized to rank both research and researchers. The prestige of membership in the system has no equal in Mexico, and most of Mexico‚Äôs universities and research institutions have links to the organization. However, the organization has been criticized in the 2000s. One criticism of the organization is that it has replaced universities in the function of evaluating research in Mexico. However, most institutions of higher education in Mexico accept the organization‚Äôs evaluations. Another is that the system gives insufficient or no recognition to the work involved in teaching and the diffusion of research results (conferences, etc.). It also does not create a distinction between those in the physical and social sciences or humanities even though they have different ways of working. Membership Evaluation of members and potential members mostly relies on their academic credentials and production but also includes other factors such as the creation of programs and projects. To become and remain a member of the SNI, researchers must show a history of systematic research in their fields, done as part of their employment with a university or research institution and duly documented. At least twenty hours per week must be spent in research if in Mexico or work must be completely research related if abroad. Researchers are evaluated through the publication of articles, books, research results and book chapters as well as patents, technological innovations and technology transfer, if applicable. Other areas for evaluation include the direction of professional and post-graduate theses, the teaching of undergraduate and graduate courses and the formation of new researchers and research groups. There are two main categories, Candidate and National Researcher (Investigador Nacional), with the latter divided into Level I, Level II, Level III and National Researcher Emeritus (Investigador Nacional Em√©rito ). In order to be admitted as members, applicants must hold a doctoral degree, demonstrate the ability to perform original research in their fields, and must have finished their bachelors not more than fifteen years prior to the application date (although exceptions are made in the last requirement). For Level I, the researcher must also show work in the direction of theses and the teaching of undergraduate and graduate courses as well as show evidence of the creation of knowledge in their fields. For Level II, in addition to the previous requisites the research output must be recognized as that of a leader in the field with its quality being assessed by senior members of the System. Graduate level thesis direction and/or other forms of post-baccalaureate mentoring are also required. Level III is reserved for those researchers who have made significant contributions to their fields in Mexico. All levels are subject to periodic re-evaluation, except for Emeritus, which is for life. Less than half of all researchers in the country are members, and most of the members are concentrated at the grades of Candidate and Level I http://www.foroconsultivo.org.mx/libros_editados/SNI_en_numeros.pdf. Mexican researchers that work abroad and are SNI members do not receive an economical incentive, and their membership is considered as an academic distinction. In recent years, the organization has had difficulty in recruiting younger researchers. Most members, just over fifty percent are in the Mexico City area, with other concentrations of researchers in Baja California, Guanajuato, Hidalgo, State of Mexico, Jalisco, Michoac√°n, Morelos, Nuevo Le√≥n, Puebla, San Luis Potos√≠, Sonora and Veracruz. History The idea for the organization began in 1982, when the then economic crisis of the country decimated salaries for researchers, prompting many to leave the country to find opportunities. Its initial promoters include Jorge Flores, Salvador Malo and Jos√© Sarukh√°n, along with Jes√∫s Reyes Heroles (then head of the Secretar√≠a de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica) and President Miguel de la Madrid. The outline of the organization was laid out in an October 1983 meeting of the Academia Mexicana de Ciencias (then the Academia de la Investigaci√≥n Cient√≠fica) in Oaxtepec, Morelos. The organization was approved by Mexico‚Äôs president in December 1983 with the first meeting of the executive committee convened in August 1984. Its first priorities were to select the first round of members and then establish salaries for researchers that would counter the effects of ‚Äúbrain drain.‚Äù Since its initial formation it has experienced reforms and adjustments to its organization and evaluation criteria, most notably in 1986, 1988, 1993 and 1995. During this time it was part of CONACYT‚Äôs larger program to reforming post-graduate study in the country, which suffered from low standards and quality. The organization has grown from its initial 1,200 members to more than 30,500 (2019). It has affected how post graduate study is accredited in Mexico and has been instrumental in the formation of public policies towards research in Mexico, especially in the sciences. However, after twenty five years, there has been institutional fatigue and other issues presented by changing technologies and other challenges in higher education. Mexico still struggles to compete internationally in research. There is still a severe shortage of researchers in the sciences in Mexico as there are only 0.5 researchers per 100,000 economically active people, a rate similar to that of Guatemala and less than that of Argentina. As of 2011, Mexico ranked 35th, behind Brazil, South Africa and China in research activity. Most research activity is concentrated in peer-reviewed articles rather than the economically more important generation of patents.

She was self-taught, and many of her observations were made in the grounds of The Grove in Stanmore, the estate outside London which she shared with her husband during his lifetime and where she lived as a widow. She was described in 1912, as \\"one of the most popular naturalists of her day\\". Personal life She was born in 1830 in Banff, Aberdeenshire, Scotland; her parents were Margaret and George Elder, and she had three other siblings. Her mother died in 1837 and her father was by then also dead. She was adopted, after her mother died, by her uncle, Alexander Elder, co-founder of Smith, Elder & Co. Elder moved to Streatham to live with her uncle, and then to Stoke Newington. She did not receive a formal education. She expressed interest in natural history as a child and described her youth as \\"extremely lonely and quiet\\". In 1855 she married George Brightwen, a banker who then ran a successful business of his own. The couple moved to Stanmore and lived in a house called Elderslie, in Bushey, Hertfordshire. Brightwen suffered from health problems, and had a nervous breakdown in 1872. She lived as a recluse for 10 years, with little to no contact with her husband and friends. She rarely left the house and did not read. When George Brightwen died in 1883 she emerged from reclusiveness, to be active intellectually and physically, but continued to suffer from body pains for the rest of her life. She still rarely left The Grove. Brightwen lived in Stanmore until she died in May 1906. The house, The Grove, was an estate with 170 acres of grounds where she carried out much of her research. The couple renovated the house, to a design carried out by Brightwen Binyon. She made the billiard room into a museum after her husband's death. Eliza Brightwen was a philanthropist and attended church regularly. She died childless, and is buried at a church in Stanmore. Work Brightwen did much of her research on location in the woods and grounds of her home, The Grove. She started writing about her work when she was sixty. In 1890, she published Wild Nature Won by Kindness, about animal life. She became well known as a naturalist. In 1892, she published her second book, More about Wild Nature, followed by Inmates of my House and Garden, in 1895. It is considered her master work. She published a total of six publications during her lifetime. She socialized with Philip Henry Gosse (whose second wife, also named Eliza Brightwen, was her husband's sister), William Henry Flower, William Hooker, and James Paget. She also wrote about the concept of \\"home museums,\\" as written in More about Wild Nature. The concept of home museums stems from her own home museum at The Grove. On her death, a collection of essays were published titled Last Hours with Nature. An autobiography was also published, with an epilogue by her nephew Edmund Gosse. Bibliography *Brightwen, Eliza.

He joined the firm Turner, Martin & Symes in 1979, becoming a partner of the practice in 1981. In 1985, he left law for the charity sector, becoming Secretary for development at the Sue Ryder Foundation. Between 1990 and 1995, he was Director of UK Operations for the British Red Cross. From 1995 to 2001, he was Chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Relief. In July 2001, he returned to the British Red Cross to become its Chief executive. For 2013, his salary in that role is a controversial ¬£184,000, given that the income of the charity is falling. In marked contrast with Young's very generous salary, some 10% of British Red Cross Society's staff are paid the National Minimum Wage of only ¬£6.31 an hour. He announced his intention to resign in June 2014 because of family reasons. From June, he worked part-time before standing down at the end of August 2014. He remains involved in the charity following his retirement, having been appointed an honorary vice-president. In addition to his career in the charity sector, he has held a number of government positions. From 2000 to 2001, he was a member of the NHS Modernisation Board. There he was the architect of the new NHS cancer plan. He continued his influence on government health policy as an adviser to the then health secretary, Alan Milburn. From 2010, he is a member of the Foreign Secretary's Human Rights Advisory Group. He has been an independent member of the National Honours Committee who review nominations for a British honour since 2011. Honours In the Queen's Birthday Honours of 2000, it was announced that Young was to become a Knight Bachelor (Kt) 'for services to cancer care'. On 12 December 2000, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. He was made a Freeman of the City of London in 2007. In 2009, he was invited to become a Companion of the Chartered Management Institute (CCMI).

It has a polar flagellum that is used for motility and has been shown to be critical for its virulence to corals. It is a versatile pathogen, impacting several marine invertebrates including Pocillopora damicornis corals (hence its name), both the Pacific and Eastern Oyster‚Äôs larvae (Crassostrea gigas and Crassostrea virginica) and some vertebrates such as the Rainbow Trout. It is a bacterium of considerable interest given its direct contribution to temperature dependent coral bleaching as well as its impacts on aquaculture where it can contribute to significant mortalities in larval oyster hatcheries. There are several known virulent strains, which appear on both the Pacific and Atlantic Coasts of the United States. After its initial discovery some strains were incorrectly classified as Vibrio tubiashii including the RE22 and RE98 strains but were later reclassified as Vibrio coralliilyticus.  Pathogenicity and Virulence Factors  Vibrio coralliilyticus is a causative agent of both bacterially induced coral bleaching and larval oyster mortality. In corals this bleaching is the result of the death of endosymbiont colonies which is mediated by V. coralliilyticus disabling Photosystem II and in some cases causing cell lysis. This also seems to be exacerbated by increased virulence as a result of increasing ocean temperatures. In oyster larvae an outbreak of V. coralliilyticus in a hatchery can result in mortality of up to 80%, greatly reducing hatchery production for that season leading to significant economic loss. In oysters the pathogen can cause deformities of the cilia as well as disfigurements of the velum, and eventually death. V. coralliilyticus also kills bacterial cells as well utilizing a Type VI secretion system to kill competitors, even out competing Vibrio cholerae cells in a bacterial killing assay. V. coralliilyticus possesses a host of virulence factors that contribute to its pathogenicity. It has been found to utilize several proteases, secretion systems, hemolysins, resistance factors, and quorum sensing. Some of the known proteases, zinc-metalloproteases, cause the previously mentioned inactivation of Photosystem II in coral photosynthetic endosymbionts (Symbiodinium) leading to coral beaching. Known secretion systems include Type III, Type IV and Type VI. Spinard et. al made note of several metalloprotease and hemolysin genes in the draft genome sequence published in 2015, several of which resembled proteins of known function found in a related pathogen, Vibrio anguillarum .  Treatments  Vibrio coralliilyticus has been studied quite extensively since its discovery and as such, several potential treatments for infected organisms have been proposed. In a publication by Zhao et. al in 2018 use of a probiotic organism, Phaobacter inhibens strain S4, was proposed as a potential solution to V. coralliilyticus infection in larval oysters. The S4 strain was able to inhibit production of proteases by the Vibrios and slow their growth using antibiotic compounds as well . Another proposed solution, directed towards coral pathogenicity, is the use of phage therapy to prevent the spread of the bacteria to neighboring corals.

Cloud is represented by pencil shading. Note the shading along the overland telegraph. Letter from Mr. F. S.

A synoptic chart drawn at the West Terrace Observatory, Adelaide that is larger in geographical reach than any known chart from another meteorological service for that time period. Sample of one of approximately 750 rainfall maps, this also showing thunderstorm activity Sample of weather data from overseas telegrams The Todd Weather Folios are a collection of continental Australian synoptic charts that were published from 1879 to 1909. The charts were created by Sir Charles Todd's office at the Adelaide Observatory. In addition to the charts, the folios include clippings of newspaper articles and telegraphic and handwritten information about the weather. The area covered is mainly the east and south-east of Australia, with occasional reference to other parts of Australasia and the world. The maps are bound into approximately six-month folios, 63 of which cover the entire period. There are approximately 10,000 continental weather maps along with 750 rainfall maps for South Australia, 10 million printed words of news text, and innumerable handwritten observations and correspondences about the weather. The folios are an earlier part of the National Archives of Australia listed collection series number D1384.  The History of the Folios  With the advent of the telegraph it was possible to simultaneously collect data, such as surface temperature and sea-level pressure, to draw synoptic weather charts. With Charles Todd's appointment as Postmaster General to the Colony, he trained not only his telegraph operators, but also his postmasters as weather observers. These observers provided valuable data points that, in combination with telegraphed observations from the other colonies (including New Zealand), showed the development and progress of weather activity across a large part of the Southern Hemisphere. Todd's best known feat was his construction management of the Overland Telegraph from Adelaide to Port Darwin. This line of communication was critical to his capacity to create continent-wide synoptic charts as the telegraphic observations from the Outback enabled the connection of data points on the east coast of Australia with similar data points on the west and southern coasts. These continent-scale isobaric lines allowed Todd and his staff to draw synoptic charts that in the early 1880s had a greater breadth than any (known) synoptic charts drawn elsewhere in the world. The folios grew out of Todd's desire to inform the colonists of South Australia of the immense size of weather systems and that in southern Australia, they generally progressed from west to east and not from east to west as commonly assumed by the early colonists. To accomplish this, Todd displayed daily the last 6 synoptic charts for public viewing then bound and stored them in the folios. The Todd weather folios consist not only of synoptic charts, but also include clippings from newspapers detailing weather statistics and events for all the eastern colonies of Australia. Newspapers from Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne were collected as they came off the inter-colonial trains and were processed for pasting up next to the corresponding synoptic chart. The collection from 1879 includes the earliest use of isobaric maps. It then develops through to the first maps posted for public consumption in the mid 1880s, and finishes with the ‚Äòproduction maps‚Äô of pre-Federalised weather observations and forecasting. The maps are accompanied by other information including the first in-house forecasts (and later published forecasts), early rainfall maps, weather observations from the logs of sailing ships, and telegrams and letters about significant weather events.  Digitising the Collection  As the original documents are in a fragile state and not easily accessible, a team of volunteers of the Australian Meteorological Society (AMETA) hosted by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, has digitally imaged the full 31-year run of Todd's charts and accompanying text. The digital images have been handed to the National Archives of Australia for inclusion in the Australian Digital Heritage collection. Access to the 26,000 high quality images is also available on-line. The volunteer group has also digitised data from the Todd folios which have been forwarded for inclusion in the International Surface Pressure Databank (ISPD). This has been done as part of Project ACRE(Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth) of the Climate Monitoring and Attribution Group, Meteorology Office Hadley Centre, UK. ACRE exists to gather data to fuel a weather ‚Äòbackcasting‚Äô model extending back to 1750. The Todd folios contain data of value to this initiative, data that is no longer available through other records. In many cases, the original documents containing the data recorded by weather observers are no longer in existence or are irretrievably lost, which gives significance to their recording in Todd's synoptic charts and ancillary documents. Three key concerns have driven the project; they are to make this historical archive discoverable, accessible, and future-proofed. In an electronic format on the internet, discoverability and accessibility are greatly enhanced. With the National Archives agreement to store the images, future-proofing the electronic images is assured.

The road, which parallels the West Branch of the Penobscot River, was built between 1969 and 1972 to bring raw wood to the mill from the company's of woodland in the Maine North Woods. Before the road was built logs were floated down the river to the mill. The of the road from the Millinocket mill to Ripogenus Dam is partly paved and the remaining is stone. Great Northern had always allowed private drivers access to the road (except for the portion next to the mill) and it is a major thoroughfare into the North Woods for sportsmen and white water paddlers on the Penobscot. The road's name is often believed to have been because of its cost (Great Northern said in the 1980s the cost of maintaining its road network was $6.8 million/year) but company officials said the road was actually considered a big cost savings‚Äînoting the shipping timber down the river took about 18 months and there would be loss of logs in the process and the road shortened the process to a few days. Others believe that the road was named after its appearance; the color of the dirt was so yellow that the road appeared to be the color gold. Great Northern's economic hold on the road has been greatly diminished, and it has announced plans to tear down almost all of the buildings at the Millinocket mill. The road is now owned by four companies. A proposal in 2007 for the state of Maine to investigate acquiring the road was defeated.

Early life  Buchanan was born at Heathfield, St. Anns, Jamaica on 10 December 1807, the fourth son (and eighth child) of George Buchanan (1758‚Äì1826) a Scots-born sugar planter and Jane Gowie (1777‚Äì1815) daughter of a Scottish St. Kitts planter. In 1816, following the death of his mother, he returned to Great Britain with the remainder of his family and settled at Sherborne, Dorset. He completed his education in Sherborne before traveling to Paris to study medicine. Whilst in Paris he became embroiled in the 1830 Polish uprising against the Russians (the November Uprising or Cadet War q.v.) and, finding his sympathies lay with the Poles, joined the Polish Army as a surgeon, remaining with them until the Russians finally put down the uprising in 1831.  Life in New Zealand  Initially the Buchanan family settled in Auckland, buying land and constructing a house \\"Clavernok\\". In 1860, however, hearing that there was good land available in Otago, Buchanan travelled to Dunedin and rode into the interior, eventually buying a property called Patearoa which he then operated as a sheep station. The station covered some 30,000 ha. (75,000 acres). The remainder of the family joined him at Dunedin in 1862 where he constructed a house, called Chingford after their former home in England. Eschewing his profession (other than to attend emergencies) Buchanan appears to have concentrated on farming, expanding Chingford in 1863 to 21 acres and regularly travelling to his sheep station.  Political life  Buchanan was nominated to the Legislative Council by Governor Gore Brown in 1861 and he took his seat in 1862. Over the ensuing 12 years he was active in many issues but gained particular attention for his concern for the conditions of mental hospitals and is credited with developing \\"the humane method\\" in New Zealand.  Return to England and death  In 1873 Buchanan left New Zealand for England, travelling via Hawaii. He went to live in Sherborne, Dorset where he died on 4 September 1877 (some accounts give Dijon, France as place of death). His eldest daughter Emma, who married Humphrey Stanley Herbert Jones, was a noted botanist, author and artist. His daughter Janet married William Baldwin.

The genus is monotypic, including only the species Helodermoides tuberculatus. Helodermoides belongs to an extinct subfamily of anguids called Glyptosaurinae. In addition to many fragmentary bones, several complete skeletons of Helodermoides are known. Like other glyptosaurines, Helodermoides was covered in small scale-like bones called osteoderms. The osteoderms covering its skull are hexagonal, tightly interlocking, raised, and rounded. One fossil of Helodermoides preserves a fused mass of osteoderms at the tip of a shortened tail, thought to represent healing after the end of the tail fell off. The tail would not have been able to grow back because the osteoderms formed a thick bony cap preventing growth. The ability to lose a tail, called autotomy, is also present in living anguids.

History De La Cruz were formed in mid-2011 by Australian guitarist and Kramer Guitars endorsee Casey Jones, and Auckland, New Zealand born vocalist Roxxi Catalano. The band recruited Melbourne based drummer Lacey Lane, Brisbane Guitarist Rory Joy and local bass player Dennis Jaculli. They recorded a self-funded and online released Self Titled E.P in October 2011 along with a video clip for the track 'Lust Fame Money'. The release of this E.P led to a full page article and album review in Classic Rock AOR Magazine. Track No. 1 'Good As It Gets' was featured on Episode 1, Season 6 of hit U.S television show Dexter. Shortly after release of the E.P, bassist Dennis 'Jakki' Jaculli left the band and was replaced by local Brisbane based muso Grant Daniell. In mid-2012 the band signed a multi-album recording contract with European Record Label Frontiers Records and began work on their debut full-length album. Street Level Street Level was the full- length debut album from De La Cruz, released in Japan on 6 March 2013 and globally on 22 March 2013, featuring 12 tracks (the Japanese version includes bonus track \\"De la cruz\\"). This was the band's first release on Frontiers Records. The album went on to gain critical acclaim both in Classic Rock Magazine and in numerous online zines and sites. A video clip was released for the song \\"Cherry Bomb\\", track No. 6 on Street Level. In April 2013, shortly after the album release, lead-guitarist and formative member Casey Jones announced he would be leaving De La Cruz permanently citing disillusion with the music industry as a contributing factor. In the wake of this, vocalist Roxxi Catalano informed fans that a new guitarist would be sourced in time and that the sonic trademark and dynamic of the band would not be changed. After a few months hiatus, De La Cruz announced on 25 July 2013 that they had found a replacement for Jones, in the Sydney-based guitarist, Stevie Strange. On 14 October 2013, bassist Grant Daniell decided to separate from the band for personal reasons. They announced on 24 March that they were splitting up.

The museum is on Huqiu Road, in the former Royal Asiatic Society building completed in 1933 near The Bund waterfront. The museum is dedicated to being an influential, innovative, sustainable organization devoted to the promotion of projects within the field of international contemporary art. There are no permanent collections. Featured Chinese artists have included Cai Guo-Qiang and Zeng Fanzhi. History Rockbund Art Museum is located in the peninsular headland where Suzhou Creek flows into the Huangpu River, in an area now marketed as the \\"Source of the Bund\\" (Waitanyuan). The museum is housed in the former Royal Asiatic Society (RAS) building, which was also home to one of China's first modern museums, the previous Shanghai Museum. Adjacent to the Former Consulate-General of the United Kingdom, Shanghai, this neighborhood was one of the first settlements of foreign expatriates, and a centre of cultural and commercial prosperity. Started in 1932, the Art Deco RAS building was part of the history of 19th and 20th century Sino-European cultural and academic exchange. At its height, this five-story building, which contained a lecture hall, a library, and a museum, received over 7,000 visits a month. Bringing together the functions of scholarly research, cultural exchange and public education under one roof, this structure was unique in Shanghai at the time. During the half-century of its existence, the RAS Shanghai Museum had established collaborative relationships with museums internationally, including the British Museum, the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Mus√©e Guimet in France. Through its programmes, it contributed to scholarship in related disciplines, cultural exchanges between China and the rest of the world, and the dissemination of scientific knowledge in the community. Eventually it had become the largest center for Oriental Studies as well as an institution for public education. In 1952, RAS closed its operation in China. At its request, its collections were transferred to the new Shanghai Municipal Services, which included 20,328 natural specimens, 6,663 historical artifacts and over 14,000 books and documents. They were then reallocated to Shanghai Natural History Museum, the new Shanghai Museum and the Bibliotheca Zi-Ka-Wei (the Xujiahui Library, a special collection of the Shanghai Library), forming the core collection of the three institutions respectively. Building In 2005, the Shanghai Bund de Rockefeller Group Master Development Co. Ltd. obtained the right to develop the area. With consideration for its historical and cultural heritage, and as a form of contribution to the community, the developer decided to restore the RAS building, and to renovate it into a public museum for contemporary art. The British architect David Chipperfield, who had previously directed the planning of the Museum Island in Berlin, was In charge of the task of restoration and design planning of the building in 2007, maintaining a minimalist style. The building was originally designed by the British design firm Palmer and Turner. In highlighting a blend of Western architectural elements with Shanghai's cityscape, the firm incorporated traditional Chinese decorative elements in the building and created a unique hybrid architectural style. In an effort to retain the original flavour of the historical building, David Chipperfield chose to stay consistent to the original 1932 design in the building‚Äôs main exterior facade in the restoration. To facilitate the functions of a modern art museum, the restoration, extended the building eastward, creating an open plaza on the ground floor, and a rooftop outdoor terrace on the eastern fa√ßade, the new parts echoing the old. At the same time, to meet the periodic changes necessary for modern art exhibitions, the designer made modifications to the existing space. The biggest renovation is in the skylight design that connects the upper three floors. For the interior colour scheme, the building's original precedent was followed, with light colours in the exhibition spaces with black steel and wooden furniture, providing a clean backdrop for exhibitions.

Ricks House, also known as the Y.W.C.A. House, The Palms and St. Francis Hospital at 730 H. Street, [Eureka, CaliforniaEureka , California was designed and built by Fred and Walter Butterfield in 1885 for owners Thomas Fouts Ricks and his wife, Eva. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in October 1992. Description The building is a two- story detached Eastlake ornamented dwelling with three bays and a 1.5-story rear addition located on a quarter city block. The house is architecturally significant as most detailed example of Eastlake style in Eureka. History Thomas F. Ricks (1855‚Äì1908) was born in Eureka, California, the son of 49-er Caspar S. Ricks (November 10, 1821 Rome, Indiana - June 21, 1888 San Francisco) who built many business and residential blocks in Eureka and Adaline A. Fouts of Clark County, Indiana who also owned Eureka property independent from that of her husband. The children of C.S. Ricks were well-to- do, socially prominent and influential. Thomas Ricks owned the Ricks Livery Stable. Thomas' younger brother, Hiram Lambert Ricks (1860 - January 27, 1921) established the present day Eureka water system, then named the \\"Ricks Water Company\\", served as Mayor of Eureka, and began campaigning for the Northwestern Pacific Railroad to Captain A.H. Payson, then president of the line. Both Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Ricks had extensive property holdings in Eureka, and Mrs. Rick's business extended as far as San Francisco, to which she traveled frequently. Thomas Ricks died in 1908, aged 53. The building served as a private home from 1885 until Mrs. Ricks leased it to the privately owned St. Francis Hospital from 1907 to 1910. While the exterior was unchanged, the interior was modified to support hospital operations. Subsequently, from 1910 to 1925, it became Sequoia Hospital. In 1925 the building was sold to Charles J.A. Nelson who turned it into a boarding house named \\"The Palms.\\" In 1935, the building became the Y.W.C.A. local chapter headquarters. The Y.W.C.A. owned the house until the late 1980s when College of the Redwoods purchased it.

It has a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring throughout the world, being most active in warmer climates.Gahlhoff, J. E. Furniture carpet beetle (Anthrenus flavipes). Publication Number EENY-19. University of Florida IFAS. 1997, revised 2010. It is a pest that damages household materials such as textiles. Description This beetle is 2 to 3.5 millimeters long and round in shape. It is black with variable patterns of white and yellow mottling. The legs are covered in yellow scales. It looks similar to other carpet beetles, but its tiny body scales are rounded or oval, while those of other carpet beetles are longer and narrower. Each antenna is tipped with a club.Anthrenus flavipes. (LeConte, 1854). Pest Insects of our Cultural Heritage. Centre Interdisciplinaire de Conservation et de Restauration du Patrimoine. During its adult lifespan of 30 to 60 days, the female beetle lays up to 100 white eggs. The eggs are visible but less than one millimeter long. The larvae emerge in one to three weeks. The larva is oval or \\"carrot-shaped\\"Koehler, P. G., et al. Carpet Beetles. Document ENY-204 (IG089). University of Florida IFAS. 1991, revised 2011. and about 5 millimeters long at its final stage. It varies in color according to diet and it is coated in long, brown hairs. The larva of this species can be distinguished from that of its relative, the common carpet beetle (Anthrenus scrophulariae), by the presence of a bundle of hairs on the posterior end which is constantly vibrating. This bundle, located just above the anus, is called the supra-anal organ. All instar stages of the larva have the organ, and there is a specific number of hairs in it at each instar. The vibration of the organ is an antipredator adaptation that helps to repel predators such as pseudoscorpions (Chelifer sp.) and the parasitoid wasp Laelius pedatus. After progressing through six to thirty instars over 2 to 3 months, the larva pupates for 2 or 3 weeks. Biology Damage to cloth =Reproduction= Sexual behavior includes a \\"characteristic headstand posture\\" assumed by the female beetle when she releases her sex pheromone, which has been identified as (Z)-3-decenoic acid. =Diet and impacts= This beetle is more common in warm regions, but it can inhabit heated buildings in cooler areas. The adult beetle feeds on pollen and nectar, often from plants of the parsley family. The larva is responsible for the damage that makes the species notorious. It can digest keratin, and its diet is made up largely of a variety of animal tissues and products constructed from them. It feeds on hair and fur, horns, silk, wool, bristles, feathers, skin, bone, and tortoise shell.Furniture carpet beetle, Anthrenus flavipes (LeConte). Integrated Pest Management Working Group, museumpests.net In nature, carpet beetles live and feed in the nests of birds, rodents, insects, and spiders. This species also readily attacks plant-based and synthetic materials if they have animal fibers integrated into them or are stained with blood, feces, or animal-derived oils. It does significant damage to upholstered furniture, carpets, and fabrics of cotton, linen, rayon, and jute. It is also a pest of museums and collections when it attacks biological specimens such as dried insects and taxidermy. In libraries and archives it consumes materials derived from leather and skins, such as book bindings and parchment. The larva has also been noted to feed on mold, dry cheese, and casein, and it can damage wood and cardboard. Management Infestations in the home can be identified by the presence of larvae, their molted cuticula, and their damage, which can be obvious. The tiny adult beetles are present in warmer months. Furniture and other susceptible objects should be vacuumed to remove hairs and loose fibers. Some objects require steam cleaning or dry cleaning. Materials should be kept clean of animal oils. Furs can be protected in cold storage, and museum specimens may be frozen. An insecticide is sometimes used, mainly around carpets and rugs, as a dust such as diatomaceous earth or silica aerogel, a spray, or an emulsion. Fumigation is used in severe cases. It has been noted that mothballs are ineffective.

Early ventures and business career Ma was born in Heungshan (today's Zhongshan) of the Kwangtung Province on 21 December 1860. Following his father's footstep who emigrated to Australia two decades before, Ma went to New South Wales at the age of 19 to work in a gold mine. He was also involved in the cultivation of bananas and the fruit trade which was dominated by Chinese at the time. In 1892, Ma founded the fruit trading firm Wing Sang Company with other Christian Chinese form his village. A Sincere Department Store in Central, Hong Kong, circa 1941. Ma returned to Hong Kong in 1894 and set up a store. Impressed by the Western model of department stores, Ma opened the Sincere Department Store with other wealthy investors on 8 January 1900 at 172 Queen's Road Central, which became the first Chinese- owned department store in Hong Kong. In the store Ma introduced Western retailing ideas and engagement of both men and women as sales assistants for the first time which was seen as a revolutionary idea in the conservative colony. He also insisted on the policy of fixed price, practice of providing receipt for each sale and closing the stores on Sundays, being a Christian himself. The Sincere opened its Canton branch in 1912 and Shanghai branch in 1917. A six-storey Hong Kong store was also opened and was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1917. It had branches in the large cities such as Shanghai, Canton, Singapore, and Namning, with a paid-up capital of $7,000,000 at peak.{ Ma's business also diversified into banking, insurance, hotels and cosmetics, in the form of the National Commercial and Savings Bank, Ltd. in 1921, with an authorized capital of $5,000,000, as well as the Sincere Insurance and Investment Co. Ltd. and the Sincere Perfumery Factory. His business suffered from the Great Depression and the Second Sino-Japanese War in the 1930s which resulted in the collapse of his National Commercial Bank in 1935. Philanthropy works Ma has contributed large sums to schools and hospitals, especially in his native town of Heungshan including the establishment Sai Kwong Girls‚Äô School in Shekki, the capital of Heungshan. He also became the first Chinese director of Lingnan College in Canton, to which he made major donations. The Ma Ying-piu Infirmary and the Ma Ying-piu Guesthouse of the Sun Yat-sen University which used to be the site of Lingnan College are named after him. Political involvement Ma first met revolutionary Sun Yat-sen, also a Heungshan native, in 1892 during a visit home and was impressed by his vision of the resurrection of China that he agreed to provide him financial support. He supported the anti-Japanese boycott of 1908 in which he spurned Japanese products and replaced by locally made products. He also helped set up the East Canton Red Cross Society to relieve men wounded in the Wuchang Uprising. Ma and his wife were vocal critics of the mui-tsai system, a form of child slavery prevalent in colonial Hong Kong. Mrs. Ma was also the founding member of the YWCA Hong Kong chapter. Family He married Fok Hing-tong (1872‚Äì1957), second daughter of Fok Ching- shang, the Vicar of St. Stephen's Anglican Church. Fok Hing-tong accompanied Ma to Australia and helped out his business. She also doubled as a saleswoman on occasion. She co-founded the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) in Hong Kong and became its chairwoman (1920‚Äì23) and director (1920‚Äì28, 1948‚Äì57). Under her leadership, the YWCA strongly supported the anti-mui tsai movement in the 1920s. The couple had 13 children, of which the fourth son, Ma Man-fai, was a social activist.

A student project that was developed over the course of a semester, it is Lynch's first film and was shot while he was attending the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The film consists of an animated painting, depicting six dysmorphic figures regurgitating in sequence with the sound of a siren loop. The film was created on a budget of $200 and upon its screening it was well received by Lynch's peers, earning the Dr. William S. Biddle Cadwalader Memorial Prize at the school's experimental-painting-and-sculpture contest. Six Men Getting Sick received a home-media release in 2001 as part of The Short Films of David Lynch DVD, and it has been noted by critics as containing a similar narrative structure to his 1977 debut feature film Eraserhead. Overview Six Men Getting Sick consists of a one-minute animation of a painting by David Lynch looped four times and accompanied by a soundtrack of a siren wailing. The title, which according to the liner notes of The Short Films of David Lynch \\"expresses what little plot there is\\", relates to the painting's animation as it depicts \\"six abstracted figures appearing in outline. Their internal organs become visible, and their stomachs fill with a brightly coloured substance, which travels up to their heads, causing them to vomit.\\" The film contains no plot, but it has been described by film critics as \\"a helpful paradigm for Lynch's narrative sense\\", which \\"presents us with a humorous example of our own myopia on the subject.\\" The narrative concept of Six Men Getting Sick has drawn comparisons to that of Lynch's debut feature film, 1977's Eraserhead. Production Lynch conceived the idea for Six Men Getting Sick in 1966, while attending his second semester at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In one of the school's art studios Lynch began painting a black landscape and a green garden, with \\"real dark green coming out of black.\\"Lynch 2001, 00:09‚Äì01:38 Adding a dysmorphic figure of a man to the center of the canvas, Lynch \\"hear[d] a little wind and [saw] a little movement\\", which led him to the concept of creating an animated film from a painting. Lynch discussed the idea of creating an animated film with fellow student Bruce Samuelson. Samuelson was creating \\"real fleshy paintings\\" that Lynch admired, and Lynch himself was creating a series of \\"'mechanical women'‚Äîwomen who turned into typewriters\\"; the combination of these ideas was the basis for their film. Samuelson and Lynch's project fell through, although Lynch continued developing his original idea of seeing his paintings move. He purchased a 16 camera from Photorama in downtown Philadelphia, whose staff taught Lynch the basics of stop-motion animation and cinematography. Lynch constructed a sculptured screen measuring 6 √ó10 ft, on which the final film would be projected. In a downtown Philadelphia hotel owned by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Lynch began shooting Six Men Getting Sick with Jack Fisk, who subsequently became a frequent collaborator. The film was shot in an abandoned room, with Lynch's 16 mm camera taped to the bottom of a dressing table, and single-frame shots were taken while Lynch animated his painting. To further distort the footage, Fisk cast Lynch's head in plaster and added the three plaster casts to the sculptured screen Lynch had built prior to the film shoot. Lynch then recorded a one-minute siren loop to go with the finished film. In total, Six Men Getting Sick cost $200, a sum Lynch later referred to as \\"completely unreasonable.\\"Lynch 2001, 06:11‚Äì06:31 Release Six Men Getting Sick debuted in 1967 at an experimental-painting-and-sculpture contest held at the end of the semester at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. For its premiere, Lynch constructed an Erector Set rig that was placed on top of the projector \\"so that it would take the finished film through the projector, way up to the ceiling and then back down\\", in order for the one- minute film to be presented as a four-minute continuous loop. The film was well received among Lynch's peers and earned him joint first prize at the contest, the Dr. William S. Biddle Cadwalader Memorial Prize, which he shared with fellow painter and student Noel Mahaffey. The film was made available on home-media release in 2001. It was included on The Short Films of David Lynch, a remastered DVD collection of Lynch's earliest films, which was distributed through his official website. It was later included on David Lynch: The Lime Green Set, a 2008 limited-edition ten-disc DVD-and-CD box set. In a retrospective review for DVD Verdict, Judge Bill Gibron referred to Six Men Getting Sick as \\"a disturbing and intoxicating work\\" and \\"the effect [of it] unnerving.\\" Legacy Although Six Men Getting Sick was successful among his peers, Lynch considered never again experimenting with filmmaking due to the expense of creating the film. However, following its release he was approached by classmate H. Barton Wasserman, who admired the film and was looking for a similar project to be made for an art installation at his home.Lynch 2001, 06:31‚Äì06:52 Wasserman offered Lynch $1,000 to complete the project, to which Lynch \\"immediately said yes\\".Lynch 2001, 06:53‚Äì08:37 Lynch, who had \\"a fixation on getting [his] own camera\\", purchased a clockwork Bolex film camera and spent two months creating the project, which was to be presented in a split-screen format and comprised one-third live action shots and two-thirds animation. Upon completion the film was developed, although technical errors occurred during the process, resulting in the final reel being \\"just a continuous blur.\\"Lynch 2001, 09:05‚Äì10:36 Wasserman decommissioned the project and allowed Lynch to keep the remainder of the budgeted funds, which went towards the production of Lynch's second short film, 1968's The Alphabet‚Äîa film which, in turn, led to the creation of Eraserhead. In 2014 the creators of the YouTube video series Marble Hornets claimed that Lynch's short films, including Six Men Getting Sick, were a major influence on their own work.

All is fine until a famous criminal, Leo Gillete, breaks into Sam's apartment, steals the trio's plans for a jewelry warehouse heist and accomplishes it. He then blackmails the group into designing and executing a plan to steal $20 million in bonds from a bank. Since he has evidence incriminating them in the plans, they accept. Tension escalates within the group as Rob befriends Leo, while Kevin and Sam attempt to hinder his plans. They get the security codes to the safe and successfully switch the bonds. But the situation turns against them when Leo and Rob force Kevin into an elevator and crash it. When they go to retrieve the bonds, Sam shoots Rob, then Leo shoots Sam. With the three friends dead, Leo leaves with the bonds. It is later revealed that the friends had switched Leo's gun, giving him one loaded with blanks. Sam and Kevin get up and are greeted by Rob. When Leo gets back to his place, he sees a fire started by the gang to destroy evidence against them and planted evidence against Leo on the latest burglary. Leo is taken in custody by Detective Mason, while the friends drive away in their car. Cast * Ryan Reynolds as Kevin * Kristin Booth as Sam * Joris Jarsky as Rob * David Hewlett as Lawrence Yeager * James Allodi as Detective Mason * David Suchet as Leo Gillette Production The film was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and produced by Alliance Atlantis Communications and Ego Film Arts and released theatrically on October 3, 2003, by Odeon Films in Canada and Momentum Pictures of the United Kingdom. In Canada, it was released in 204 theatres, more than any other movie in the past. Under Telefilm Canada rules stating the film producers must have a good script and firm distribution deals to get a grant of more than C$1,000,000, Telefilm granted Foolproof C$3,400,000. The entire budget was C$7,800,000. Reference Chris Parry of eFilmCritic gave it 3 out 5 and wrote: \\"The practice of Canadian companies and funding bodies unquestioningly funding any and all projects that Atom Egoyan signs his name to must end immediately. Not that this, his first foray into action thrillers, is necessarily the worst film of all time. In fact, it's actually quite enjoyable in parts. But the money blown on it could have funded eighteen smaller films that actually had a shot at the box office - or one close to this one, only which had the one secret ingredient needed to make a profit... an actual star.\\" Home release The film was released on DVD in March 2004, including behind the scenes and special effects features, the theatrical trailer and outtakes. The package also contained a CD of the soundtrack, with songs performed by The Crystal Method, The Dandy Warhols, Sam Roberts and Pilate. In 2020, mobile phone company, Mint Mobile, in which Ryan Reynolds had an ownership stake, made the film available to view for free on the website mintmobileplus.com.

The Madawaska Maliseet First Nation is located in Northern New Brunswick, a few kilometres from Edmundston, and has a band membership of 350 people. About 114 members of the MMFN lived on the St. Basile no. 10 reserve. This reserve is located 1.6 km east of Edmundston in the north-western region of New Brunswick. They are part of the Saint John River Valley Tribal Council. Family names include Bernard, Cimon, Francis and Wallace. History Maliseet Territory The Maliseet also Malecite, Mal√©cites or √âtchemins, their name for themselves, or autonym is Wolastoqiyik. Wolastoq means \\"Beautiful River\\" referring to the Saint John River. Wolastoqiyik means \\"People of the Beautiful River,\\" in Maliseet.p. 17, fnote 4 Their traditional land extended along the Wolastoq/Saint John River in New Brunswick and Maine, and had once extended as far as the St Lawrence. They were Algonkian (Algonquian) speakers. Their lands and resources were bounded on the east by traditional lands of the Mi'kmaq and on the west by Passamaquoddy (or Peskotomuhkati) and Penobscot nations. At the time of European encounter, the Maliseet (Wolastoqiyik) were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco) In addition to growing crops they subsisted from fishing, hunting and gathering fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. Since time immemorial, the site of the MMFN reserve was an important camping and meeting place of the Maliseet people during seasonal migrations. By the mid 1700s one of the largest Maliseet villages had been established at Madawaska, declining at the turn of the 19th century. A large settler community had formed at Madawaska by the early 1800s which began with the relocation of Acadians from the lower Saint John River in 1785. The French named the area Petit-Sault (Little Falls) in reference to the waterfalls located where the Madawaska River merges into the Saint John River. In the late 1880s Canadian Pacific Railway, expropriated three parcels of reserve land, totaling almost 13 acres that cut through the MMFN, for the construction of a section of a railway running from Woodstock to Edmundston. After the abandonment of this section of land for railway purposes around 1971, CP rail entered into an agreement with the Fraser Papers Inc. (now Twin Rivers) pulp mill, the largest pulp mill in the area, to run an above ground pipeline from their mill to a tailings pond on the CP easement.. \\"People couldn't go from the south to the north side of the pipeline because you know, it was on the ground‚Ä¶it was made of wood staves, 4 feet tall.\\" When it was abandoned the MMFN made a claim to get their land back. The claim lands are part of the St. Basile no. 10 reserve, where approximately 50 percent of the 228 members of the Madawaska Maliseet First Nation are living. This reserve is located 1.6 km east of Edmundston in the north-western region of New Brunswick. Non-Natives, whose land had also been expropriated for the railway, had their land returned to them. \\"The Madawaska Maliseet First Nation alleged that the Government of Canada failed to protect and preserve its interest in the reserve when Canadian Pacific Railway ceased to use the land for railway purposes.\\". The mill is paired with a Fraser paper mill directly across the Saint John River in Madawaska, Maine, through which liquified pulp slurry is piped - the only such installation anywhere along the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. Joanna Bernard, Chief of the Madawaska Maliseet First Nation, successfully negotiated a specific land claim regarding the Canadian Pacific Right of Way which included $5.7 million in compensation and the re- instatement of the reserve land in question.. \\"This settlement relates to the use of three parcels of reserve land, totaling almost 13 acres, used by Canadian Pacific Railway for the construction of a section of a railway running from Woodstock to Edmundston in the late 1800s. After the abandonment of this section of land for railway purposes around 1971, the land was then used by Fraser Papers Inc. for a pipeline. The Madawaska Maliseet First Nation alleged that the Government of Canada failed to protect and preserve its interest in the reserve when Canadian Pacific Railway ceased to use the land for railway purposes.\\". By 2012 Madawaska Maliseet First Nation also \\"negotiated an agreement with Twin Rivers, the new owners of Fraser Papers, allowing the company to continue to operate the pipeline on the reserve.\\". \\"We've signed a permit and allowed the pipeline to continue to exist ‚Ä¶it's now underground‚Ä¶it's no longer above ground‚Ä¶so the relationship continues and we try and make it a continuing positive relationship.\\" \\"The Trans Canada Highway divides our First Nation and because we have the ramps now, now we are actually able to develop the other side of the highway for commercial leasing and our very first anchor tenant will be‚Ä¶a Shell truck stop.\\". Premier David Alward announced on New Brunswick Day, 2013, that Chief Joanna Bernard was one of ten people inducted into the Order of New Brunswick. Chief Bernard was recognised \\"for her tireless efforts to ensure the well-being and economic prosperity of her community as well as of all First Nations communities in the province.\\" Notable people See also *List of communities in New Brunswick *First Nations in New Brunswick  External links  * Madawaska Maliseet First Nation website * Maliseet language and culture links * Mi'kmaq- Maliseet Institute - University of New Brunswick * Passamaquoddy-Maliseet Language Portal * References Category:Maliseet Category:Communities in Madawaska County, New Brunswick Category:Algonquian peoples Category:Ethnic groups in New Brunswick Category:Native American tribes in Maine Category:First Nations history in New Brunswick Category:Algonquian ethnonyms ","title":"Madawaska Maliseet First Nation"},{"id":"40165110","text":"Danny Orton (born in Louisiana) is an American country music songwriter and producer signed to Warner/Chappell.http://www.musicrow.com/2013/09/publisher- notes-warnerchappell-ole-dan-hodges-music/ Active since the late 1990s as a songwriter, he has had his songs recorded by Rascal Flatts, Tim McGraw, Reba McEntire, Pat Green, Love and Theft, and many other acts.

It hosts the 117th Air Refueling Wing, part of the Air National Guard, which operates the KC-135R Stratotanker. The base was previously known as Alabama Air National Guard Base.  History  KC-135R Stratotanker departing with the Alabama Air National Guard hangars and buildings behind. The base is named after United States Army Air Forces Colonel Walter Sumpter Smith who was born on 12 February 12 1896 in Belle Ellen, Alabama and became an electrical engineer and a pilot. In 1921, Smith was appointed to the 106th Observation Squadron of the Alabama National Guard and commissioned as a first lieutenant at Roberts Field in Birmingham, Alabama. He reached the rank of lieutenant colonel on August 12, 1932 and colonel in 1942. In 1934, the facilities at Roberts Field became less adequate and the local government decided to build a new facility which became Birmingham Municipal Airport. In 1938, after four years of construction, the 106th Observation Squadron moved to the new base. As a testimony to Smith‚Äôs role in the development and construction, the base was eventually named Sumpter Smith Air National Guard Base. It remained that way until sometime during the early 1990s when the name evolved to the Alabama Air National Guard Base, Birmingham, Alabama. It‚Äôs not really clear why the name changed and no official documents have been found. A push was made to restore the name of the base to Sumpter Smith Air National Guard Base and was made official during the summer of 2017.

Gameplay When Vikings Attack! plays like an arena melee-brawler game. The only weapons are thrown objects. Players control a small group of civilians fighting hordes of vikings. The objective is to pick up objects and throw them in order to knock out enemies. A single hit is required to knock- out an opponent's troop. Each time an object collides with a figure, they're knocked out and excluded from the group, but larger or wide objects may even knock out an entire group, resulting in the player being eliminated. Lost civilians can be replaced by recruiting stray people roaming around the arena. The game also features special items to be thrown such as explosive bombs for an area of effect attack. The game has a campaign mode supporting up to four player co-op. There's a multiplayer option with a few game modes such as last man standing and survival mode. The game also features collection extra for view collected citizens of different outfits and movies. Reception The game received mixed to fairly positive reviews.

Like its predecessor, some criticism was made of the screen quality, with Lockford describing it as \\"dull and uninspiring\\", and CNET Australia's Nic Healey criticizing it as a \\"barebone or no-frills\\" compared to the 2013 Google Nexus 7, despite otherwise finding it worth a look.

It flows through the Nechako Plateau. Before the construction of Kenney Dam in the early 1950s the Cheslatta was a minor tributary of the Nechako. Today the Nechako River is dry above the Cheslatta, which provides all its source water. The name \\"Cheslatta\\" comes from a Dakelh word meaning either \\"top of small mountain\\" or \\"small rock mountain at east side\\". Course Before the Nechako Reservoir was created in the early 1950s the Cheslatta River began north of Ootsa Lake. After the Kenney Dam was built, Ootsa Lake merged with many other lakes, forming the Nechako Reservoir. Skins Lake, a small lake just north of Ootsa Lake near the original headwaters of the Cheslatta River, was also joined to the Nechako Reservoir. At Skins Lake the reservoir's spillway was built, allowing excess water to be released into the Cheslatta River. Today Skins Lake is considered the source of the Cheslatta River. From there the Cheslatta flows generally east and a little south. Moxley Creek and Dog Creek join from the north, after which the river widens into the long but relatively narrow Cheslatta Lake. Knapp Creek empties into Cheslatta Lake from the north. After Cheslatta Lake the river flows a short distance before widening into Murray Lake. Bird Creek joins from the west. After Murray Lake the river flows a few kilometres to its confluence with the Nechako River. The Cheslatta cascades overs Cheslatta Falls just before joining the Nechako. Numerous small tributary streams join the Cheslatta River along its course. Discharge Originally the Cheslatta River was small, with an average annual flow of about . After the Nechako Reservoir was filled its level has been controlled by releasing water into the Cheslatta River via the Skins Lake Spillway. These releases average , ranging from no flow to a 2007 release and flood of . Flows above are not uncommon, and four times flows have exceeded . Search for Station 08JA013 Skins Lake Spillway, Nechako Reservoir History Although it follows smaller, pre-existing watercourses, the modern Cheslatta River has existed only since the 1950s. Before the Nechako Reservoir was created, the river's course was a small, meandering stream through swamps and meadows north and east of Ootsa Lake. Its lower reaches were called Murray Creek. The river has been greatly altered as a result of the Kemano Power Project, which diverts water from the Nechako River basin to the Pacific Ocean in order to provide power for an Alcan aluminium smelter in Kitimat. In the early 1950s Kenney Dam was built on the Nechako River a short distance upriver from the Cheslatta‚ÄìNechako confluence, creating the Nechako Reservoir. A long tunnel was blasted through the Coast Mountains, connecting the Nechako Reservoir to a hydroelectric powerhouse at Kemano. Transmission lines were built to carry the electricity to the Alcan company town of Kitimat, which was also built in the 1950s. In 2007 Alcan was bought by Rio Tinto Alcan, which runs the Kemano Power Project today. When Kenney Dam was built in the early 1950s there were about 200 Cheslatta T'en living in four villages and 17 Indian Reserves along the Cheslatta River and Cheslatta Lake. In 1953 these indigenous people had to move away and surrender of land. They were relocated to Grassy Plains, away. Aside from losing their traditional village sites and trapping territory, three of the Cheslatta T'en's graveyards were washed away by outflow from the new reservoir. The Cheslatta say they were promised that any graves that would be flooded would be moved to higher ground, while Alcan says the Cheslatta understood and agreed to the flooding of the graves in Reserves 5 and 7, provided two recent graves were moved. Alcan thought the graveyard at Reserve 9 was above the flood level, but when water was first released from Nechako Reservoir in 1957 it swept through the Reserve 9 graveyard and washed many graves away. The Cheslatta say that coffins and skeletal remains were found in and around Cheslatta Lake during the summer of 1957, and that the three graveyards have continued to be flooded at least twice a year since the Skins Lake spillway began operating. In 1992 the graveyard sites at Reserves 5 and 7 were reconsecrated, with new crosses and gravehouses erected, as part of the Cheslatta redevelopment project. Within a month, however, another discharge of water flooded the graveyards, washing the new gravehouses and crosses into Cheslatta Lake. Kenney Dam has no gates or spillways. It completely blocks the Nechako River, whose bed runs dry through the Nechako Canyon between Kenney Dam and the mouth of the Cheslatta River. A spillway for the Nechako Reservoir was built at Skins Lake, west of Kenney Dam. From Skins Lake excess water is released into the Cheslatta River. It took several years for the Nechako Reservoir to fill, during which time the Cheslatta River remained in its natural state. By 1957 the reservoir was full and Alcan began releasing large amounts of water into the Cheslatta River via the Skins Lake spillway. Before 1957 the Cheslatta River was a small stream with an average annual flow of about . Alcan began releasing water flows far above the Cheslatta's natural capacity, resulting in a deep channel being carved out and large-scale erosion filling the Cheslatta and upper Nechako Rivers with sediment. In addition, the area between the Skins Lake spillway and the headwaters of the Cheslatta River was not a river but rather a series of meadows, pastures, and small lakes. Water released from the reservoir scoured the area between Skins Lake and Cheslatta Lake. Soil, gravel, grass, moss, shrubs, and trees were washed away, down into the Cheslatta River and into the Nechako River. In 1961 the Cheslatta's flow reached about , causing the river to avulse and carve a new path, bypassing Cheslatta Falls. Enormous amounts of mud, silt, and debris were dumped into the Nechako River. The Cheslatta eventually returned to its original course over the falls, but in 1972 it again returned to the channel that had been cut around the falls in 1961, washing away an entire hill and filling the Nechako River with more debris and sediment. After the 1972 flood, Alcan built a coffer dam to prevent the river from taking the route around the falls again. About half of the sediment from the 1961 avulsion was deposited in a fan, called the Cheslatta Fan, on the former Nechako River bed, above Cheslatta Falls. Geology The greatly increased flow and erosion along the Cheslatta River has resulted in unusually well-exposed late Quaternary and Holocene stratigraphy, which has been helpful to geologists trying to understand the region's geological history.

He was the son of Walter Tothill and Frances L. Williams. He was educated at Blundell's School. John Douglas Tothill was the first federal forestry official appointed in New Brunswick. He studied at the Ontario Agricultural College, specialising in entomology and botany, and in 1922 received a doctorate from Harvard University.http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/viewtext/2574586?op=t&n;=5951 He was employed for a short period by the US Bureau of Entomology Gypsy Moth Parasite laboratory. Tothill later joined the Entomology Branch of the Department of Agriculture and established a laboratory on the University of New Brunswick campus in Fredericton. Over the next decade he led research on invasive insects, such as the brown-tail moth (Euproctis chrysorrhoea), the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), and native insects such as the forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria), the fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea), and the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana). In 1923 he was transferred to the Forest Insect Division in Ottawa, and in 1924 was sent to Fiji by the Imperial Bureau of Entomology to study the problematic levuana moth. The moth was finally brought under control by the release of the tachinid fly Bessa remota from Malaysia. In Fiji he soon became the country's director of agriculture, later holding similar posts in Uganda and Sudan. Although he spent only about 12 years in Canada, he is regarded as having established biological pest control in Canada and for placing forestry on a sound scientific footing.http://cif- ifc.org/uploads/Website_Assets/One_Hundred_Years_of_Federal_Forestry_Presence_in_New_Brunswick_May:June_2012.pdf Publications *The Coconut Moth in Fiji: A History of Its Control by Means of Parasites - Ronald Wood Paine, Thomas Hugh Colebrook Taylor and John Douglas Tothill (1930) *Report of the Soil Conservation Committee - John Douglas Tothill (1944) *Agriculture in the Sudan: Being a Handbook of Agriculture As Practised in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan - John Douglas Tothill (1948) *A Report on Nineteen Surveys done in Small Agricultural Areas in Uganda - John Douglas Tothill (1938) *Agriculture in Uganda - John Douglas Tothill (1940) *Agriculture in the Sudan: Being a Handbook of Agriculture As Practised in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan - John Douglas Tothill (1948) *The Natural Control of the Fall Webworm (Hyphantria cunea Drury) in Canada - John Douglas Tothill (1922) https://www.amazon.co.uk/Books/s?ie=UTF8&field- author;=John%20Douglas%20Tothill&page;=1&rh;=n%3A266239%2Cp_27%3AJohn%20Douglas%20Tothill *Memoirs of Life in the Sudan, unpublished manuscript of A Naturalist in the Asir Mountains of Arabia, written 1952-1953 Family Tothill married Ruby Hughes.

The Simmons company used the New York company of Gordon, Tracy and Swartwout to do their design. The developer was the unusual Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Sr., who became famous for being the central character in the book \\"Cheaper By The Dozen. He used his Time and motion study ideas to further improve the efficiency of the building as he supervised its development. Building during construction in 1906from the Sioux City Journal, September 16, 1906 The architects specified that hundreds of hardened concrete piles were to be driven in to allow the soft ground to take the weight of the (estimated) two million bricks required to construct the building. Whilst the building was being built a sixth floor and other changes were made to the design. The bricks alone would have required over 250 railway cars to transport them and another 450 cars were also required to transport other building materials. The railway cars were of course easy to source as the building had its own railroad switching facilities. Simmons Hardware Company Building in Sioux City in 1917 The clock tower was designed to and would become an important landmark. The building was intended to be an \\"ornament\\" and the tower was intended to convey importance and the 12 numbers on the clockface were intended to be replaced by the letters T-R-O-Q-R-L-A-T-P-I-F. This abbreviation was to signify the Simmons motto which was \\"The recollection of quality remains long after the price is forgotten.\\" The company was the first to establish a nationwide brand for hardware which they supplied via warehouses in six states across America. Other warehouses were in New York, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio, and a four storey building in Wichita, Kansas. The warehouse's stock consisted of many items, including ammunition, knives, wires, and even dog collars. The company said that, \\"If you can't eat it, and it don't pour or fold, it's hardware\\". Salesmen were not only employed to sell all products, but they also had specialist salespeople. The company had used an aggressive system of business where it aimed to buy up its suppliers so that it had the choice of best machinery and they could give priority to their needs. In the 1920 the Winchester Repeating Arms Company decided to diversify to include knives and hardware. They bought companies and also merged with the Simmons Hardware Company. During the 1920s this warehouse would have been at the disposal of the merged Winchester and Simmons company. The Winchester and Keen Kutter brands did good business during the 1920s but in 1929 they agreed to separate and Simmons and this building returned to their core business. After hardware There were multiple owners of the warehouse throughout the years. It was owned by the Kollman-Warner Seed Company in 1939 and the Sioux City Battery Corporation in 1944. Sioux City-based farm retailer Bomgaars bought the building in 1973 and used it as a warehouse and for its corporate offices. The Bomgaars headquarters moved out in 2005 and in 2007, it was planned that the warehouse to be converted into condominiums, offices, and a restaurant. The project would have been completed with a $10.5 million budget. The owners, Roger and Jane Bomgaars, who owned the retail chain Bomgaars, partnered with developers from Omaha, Nebraska with plans to complete the restoration. The plans required city authorities to grant additional tax breaks and to make land available for parking. In 2013, the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino announced plans to open a Sioux City location, situating casino offices on the third floor of the warehouse, along with a 54 room boutique hotel taking the top two floors. The main floor of the warehouse now features the Hotel lobby, and to restaurants. A new casino adjoins the historic brick building. Plans evolved to move the hotel inside the historic building and for a 60-foot illuminated guitar to adorn the roof of the structure. Both the casino and hotel opened on August 1, 2014.

The car started out life as a Ginetta G12, and was entered by Jack Wheeler in various events in 1970 and 1971, using 1-litre, 1.3-litre, and 1.6-litre BMC straight-four engines. Racing history The Jerboa SP made its racing debut at the Targa Florio in 1970, with Jack Wheeler selecting Martin Davidson as his co-driver, and the car was fitted with a 1.3-litre BMC A-series straight- four engine. However, the team did not complete the first lap due to an accident. Wheeler and Davidson then entered the car at the 1000 km of N√ºrburgring, but did not actually attend the race; the car had been fitted with a 1.6-litre BMC engine for the event. A 1-litre A-Series was fitted for the Mugello Grand Prix, and Davidson drove the car to second place in the Prototype 1000 class. The 1.3 litre engine was refitted for the 500 km of N√ºrburgring, and Wheeler took the Prototype 1300 class victory, finishing 21st overall. Wheeler then finished 17th overall at the 500 km of Spa, which would prove to be the car's best overall finish. He also entered the car at the N√ºrburgring - Sports, Prototypes and Can-Am race in October, but did not compete in the race. The car's next appearance came at the 1971 Targa Florio, where the car was classified 40th overall, and second in the Prototype 1300 category, but Davidson and Wheeler had to retire the car after seven laps, due to clutch failure. Two weeks later, the pair entered the 1000 km of N√ºrburgring, with the car featuring a 1.6-litre engine again; however, although it was classified 28th, and third in the Prototype 1600 category, the team had again retired, this time after 29 laps. This proved to be the car's last race, as it was never used again.

Staff The founder of the company was Edward C. Simmons, who started the company in 1874 and retired in 1898. The founder's son, George Welch Simmons, started working his way up through the company in 1901, with a salary of $20 a week for driving trucks to the St. Louis warehouse. In 1904, he became the general manager and then later the vice- president of all the warehouses. Simmons was a Distinguished Successful Americans of his Day in 1912. L. E. Crandall was originally working as part of the Churchill Hardware Company. After entering into a partnership with the Simmons Hardware Company, he became well known as a salesman by traveling through Illinois. Crandall became a sales manager at the St. Louis warehouse due to this reputation, later becoming General Sales Manager of all locations. His office was in New Haven, Connecticut. History A Keen Kutter mincer from E.Simmons The company's stock consisted of many items, including ammunition, knives, mincers, wires, and even dog collars. They defined its products saying, \\"If you can't eat it, and it don't pour or fold, it's hardware\\". Salesmen were employed to sell either all items or specific items. Keen Kutter tools were manufactured by the company, and are now collectibles. The book Keen Kutter Planes lists over 800 items from the brand. Most of the company's capital stock were companies which resulted in the net worth of these companies rising. A Sioux City warehouse was opened after the corporation bought out the stock of the Baker Hardware Company, which was located in the city. Their intention was to have the same quality in that location. The company was involved in a legal case, titled \\"Simmons Hardware Co. v. City of St. Louis\\", that was heard by the Supreme Court of Missouri. The case was filed by the corporation to retrieve part of their payment on three taxes, which they paid in order to receive a merchant's license for the years of 1908 and 1909. Part of their payment of the sales tax, ad valorem tax, and the value added tax were thought by the company to be incorrect. The warehouse chain expanded from Missouri to five other states, located in New York, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio, and Kansas. Merger with Winchester Edward C. Simmons The company had used an aggressive system of business where it aimed to buy up its suppliers so that it had the choice of best machinery and they could give priority to their needs. The company would then sell off the excess capacity in these companies. Their Keen Kutter brand advertised nationally, and the KK initials were used for several of their other brands. In 1902 they bought the Walden Knife company in Walden New York. This was of interest when the Winchester Repeating Arms Company decided to include knives among their products. They merged with the Simmons Hardware Company, and moved the Walden machinery from New York to their base in Connecticut. The Winchester and Keen Kutter brands flourished during the 1920s but in 1929 they agreed to separate and Simmons returned to their core business. In October of the same year they sold the Keen Kutter Building in Wichita to Alfred Jonathon Harwi's who had a hardware company in Atchison, Kansas.Alfred Jonathon Harwi , William E.

Originally built by Lola Cars as a Lola T330, it featured a 5-litre Chevrolet V8 engine, and was used by Horst Kroll Racing between 1984 and 1987. Horst Kroll used the car to win both the Can-Am and Canadian American Thundercars Championship in 1986. Racing history The Frissbee KR3 started out as a Lola T330, and featured a 5-litre Chevrolet V8 engine. It was first used by Horst Kroll's self-run Horst Kroll Racing team at the opening round of the 1984 Can-Am season, held at Mosport; he finished in fourth place. At Dallas, he finished eighth, and fifth of the full Can-Am entries, before finishing second at Brainerd, fifth at Lime Rock, second at Road Atlanta, and fourth at Trois-Rivi√®res. The next round of the season was held again at Mosport; he went one better than the first race of the season, and took the KR3 to third place. He finished the season with eighth at Sears Point, fourth at Riverside, and eighth in the final round of the season, held at Green Valley. Kroll finished the season in third place, with 119 points; 37 behind Jim Crawford, and 31 ahead of Kim Campbell. Kroll used the KR3 again in 1985, and started the season with a win at Mosport. The next two rounds, both held at Lime Rock, were less successful; Kroll finished tenth overall, and fifth of the full Can-Am cars in the first race, before taking fourth overall, and second in class, in the second race, held two months later. The fourth race of the season was held again at Mosport; Kroll returned to the podium, taking second place. The penultimate race of the season was held at St. Louis International Raceway, where Kroll again finished second. He finished the season by finishing eleventh overall, and sixth in class, at the St. Petersburg Grand Prix. Kroll finished second in the Driver's championship, with 71 points; ten behind Rick Miaskiewicz in a similar Frissbee GR3, and 19 ahead of Lou Sell in a 2-litre March 832. For 1986, the Can-Am series saw a partial split; a new Canadian American Thundercars Championship (CAT) was formed, and four races were shared between the two, with a fifth race being held as part of the latter series. Kroll started the 1986 season in exactly the same way he had started the 1985 season; by winning the opening race at Mosport in his Frissbee KR3. Kroll followed this with fourth overall, and second in the O2L class at Summit Point, and a pair of second places, at St. Louis and Mosport. As a result, Kroll won the Can-Am championship, with 64 points; 11 points more than his closest rival, Bill Tempero, who drove a March 84C. Kroll finished the CAT season with a sixth place at Hallett, having taken tenth in the first race, and fourth in the second. This was enough to also secure him the CAT title, beating Tempero by ten points. In 1987, the Can-Am series folded, and the CAT series took over. Kroll continued to use the KR3, but retired after four laps from the first race of the season, held at Willow Springs, before finishing third at the second race; this was enough to secure seventh place at the meeting. He then took third at Hallett and Milwaukee, before finishing fourth at Sanair. Kroll finished the season by taking eighth at both Pueblo and Phoenix; his 65 points were enough for him to take third in the Driver's championship once again. He finished 27 points behind Al Lamb in a similar Frissbee GR2, and three ahead of Buddy Lazier in a March 85C. The CAT series was replaced by the American Indycar Series for 1988, and the KR3 was not used again.

Fatbergs have occurred in cities and towns worldwide, with the rise in usage of disposable (so-called \\"flushable\\") cloths. Several prominent examples were discovered in the 2010s in Britain, their formation accelerated by the city's ageing Victorian sewers. Fatbergs are costly to remove, and have given rise to public awareness campaigns about flushable waste. Description Fatbergs form at the rough surfaces of sewers where the fluid flow becomes turbulent. In pipes and tubes with smooth inner linings, fluid near the containing wall flows only slightly slower than fluid in the central channel of the pipe; thus, the whole volume of fluid flows smoothly and freely. When fluid encounters an obstruction, a resulting swirl of water starts trapping debris. An obstruction can be any type of rough surface capable of snagging debris. In brick or concrete sewers there may be surplus cement drips, damaged brickwork, or loose mortar joints damaged by frost heave. In any sub-surface pipe, even of the most advanced design, penetration by foreign intrusions such as tree roots is a commonplace cause of a fatberg blockage. In sewers carrying alkaline fluids, lipids can become calcified and solidify. Comprising not only wet wipes and fat, fatbergs may contain other items that do not break apart or dissolve when flushed down the toilet, such as sanitary napkins, cotton buds, needles, condoms and food waste washed down kitchen sinks. The resulting lumps of congealed material can be as strong as concrete, and require specialist equipment to remove. In some areas, such as London, fat blocked in a sewer can react with the lining of the pipe and undergo saponification, converting the oil into a solid, soap-like substance. Grease and fat blockages can cause sanitary sewer overflows, in which sewage is discharged into the environment without treatment. In the United States, almost half of all sewer blockages are caused by grease. Fatbergs have been considered as a source of fuel, specifically biogas. Most of the fatberg discovered in Whitechapel in London in 2017, weighing and stretching more than , was converted into biodiesel. Fatbergs can be mitigated through public awareness campaigns about flushable waste and grease traps for filtration at the source. Campaigns have been launched against wet wipes because of their effect on sewer systems, most notably by Surfers Against Sewage and the Marine Conservation Society, among other environmental NGOs, who called on the UK's Advertising Standards Authority to end ‚Äúmisleading‚Äù branding and packaging. Occurrence Fatbergs occur in sewer systems around the globe, in cities and smaller towns. Giant fatbergs have blocked sewers in London, New York, Denver, Valencia, and Melbourne. Etymology Fatberg is a compound of the words fat and berg, after iceberg. The word was used in 2008 to describe \\"large, rock-like lumps of cooking fat\\" washing up on beaches in Wales, and by 2010 was used in reference to sewer-blocking fat deposits in London. The word was added to Oxford Dictionaries Online in 2015. The term is used by authorities at Thames Water and South West Water, both in southern England.

The organization was founded in California in 1954 and now has more than 1,400 members throughout the world. The club has twenty regional chapters in the U.S., two in Canada, and one each in the UK, Germany, and Spain. It holds regular meetings and provides other tools for social networking. Membership eligibility and the list The TCC maintains a list of countries and territories by which initial membership and milestone recognition is determined. The list includes not only sovereign states but also certain territories, exclaves and island groups. As of December 2019, the list contains 329 such countries and territories. The club literature notes that \\"although some are not actually countries in their own right, they have been included because they are removed from the parent country\\", based on rules established in 1970. The designation of what qualifies to be on the list is very roughly based on the amateur radio DXCC award criteria for working 100 \\"entities.\\" The club has no requirements as to how long the traveler must have stayed in a country to qualify. Anyone who has visited 100 or more of the places on the list is eligible to join.  Records  *By 2018, twenty-four members had visited every place on the list. John Clouse, from Evansville, Indiana, was the first to travel to all of the organization's listed countries and was recognized by the 1995 Guinness World Records as \\"the world's most traveled man\\" taking the title from another TCC Club member Parke G. Thompson. The youngest to join the club was Lani Shea, whose parents Jeff and Novita from Novato, California, reported that she reached her 100th country at an age of two years and eight months. She also set a new Guinness World Record under the category of \\"Youngest person to travel to all seven continents\\", accomplished in December 2003 when she was two years and 307 days. The record is currently held by Vaidehi Thirrupathy. *Charles Veley from San Francisco in 2003 became the youngest person, at 37, to visit all countries and territories, having visited all but about 70 countries in just over three years.  Controversies  In 2004, club member Charles Veley was featured in the UK's The Daily Telegraph as the new holder of the Guinness world record for World's Most Travelled Man, but this was never reflected in the Guinness Book of World Records. Instead Guinness retired the category citing lack of an objective standard for the title. Some world travelers dispute Veley's claim to be the new World's Most Traveled Man. * *  Notable members  * Don Parrish, American adventurer * Charles Veley, American entrepreneur and founder of mosttraveledpeople.com * Richard Foltz, Canadian scholar * David L.

Orcutt (born 27 April 1864 in Hartland, Vermont; died in Haiti 25 August 1929) was a noted naturalist sometimes called \\"cactus man\\" because on many expeditions he found new species of cacti. He was active in the San Diego Society of Natural History, promoting the foundation of a local natural history museum, now the San Diego Natural History Museum. He edited the American Botanist (1898-1900), American Plants (1907-1910), and Western Scientist (1884-1919) and in his collecting work, made contributions to the fields of botany and malacology. Biography Orcutt was the eldest of five children of Herman Chandler Orcutt and Eliza Eastin Gray Orcutt. In 1879, the Orcutt family moved to San Diego, where his father, a horticulturalist, opened a nursery near the ruins of the San Diego Mission de Alcal√°. Orcutt worked with his father, collecting plant specimens in the San Diego area and Baja California. He traveled there with Charles Christopher Parry, Cyrus Pringle, and Marcus E. Jones, with whom he learned to properly catalog, collect, and preserve specimens. The genus Orcuttia and variants are named for him.List of Eponymous Species San Diego Natural History Museum In 1884 he began The West American Scientist, which he irregularly published until 1919. He began to be referred to as witty and as a hopeless eccentric. The year 1892 proved significant for him as his father died and he married a doctor from New York named Olive Lucy Eddy. Eddy was among the first women to earn a Doctor of Medicine degree at the University of Michigan‚Äôs Hom≈ìopathic Medical College at Ann Arbor, in 1882. Her medical practice did much to support them and with her sister Clara she published a magazine titled Out of Doors For Women. The couple had four children. At first Orcutt primarily collected plant specimens, but his interest began to shift from botany to conchology (Eugene Coan identified Charles as a ‚Äúpioneer malacologist‚Äù). He is credited with discovering at least three new Mollusca: Black abalone subspecies Haliotis cracherodii bonita and Haliotis cracherodii rosea, and Haliotis corrugata subspecies diegoensis. A new genus he found was named after him: Coralliochama orcutti. He went on expeditions, often alone, to El Sauzal, Punta Banda, and as far south as Misi√≥n San Fernando Rey de Espa√±a de Velicat√°. He shipped a huge collection of fossils he gathered in San Quint√≠n Bay to the American Museum of Natural History in New York. His Baja trips continued through 1919. He also traveled in Texas, Arizona, Mexico and Central America. By 1922, Charles seldom returned home, spending time in Jamaica and Haiti. He maintained a residence in Jamaica in 1927 and in 1929 the Smithsonian Institution funded him for work in Haiti. After seven months of work there, he was exhausted and ill and stayed with an American embassy official in J√©r√©mie until he was hospitalized. Charles Russell Orcutt died of malaria on the morning of 25 August 1929. He is buried in Port-au-Prince. Orcutt is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of lizard, Sceloporus orcutti.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles.

Biography  Shub obtained his Ph.D. degree at the University of California, Berkeley with a thesis entitled Endomorphisms of Compact Differentiable Manifolds on 1967. His advisor was Stephen Smale. From 1967 to 1985 he worked at Brandeis University, the University of California, Santa Cruz and the Queens College at the City University of New York. From 1985 to 2004 he joined IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center. From 2004 to 2010 he worked at the University of Toronto. After 2010 he is a researcher at the University of Buenos Aires and at the City University of New York. Shub was the Chair of the Society for the Foundations of Computational Mathematics from 1995 to 1997. In 2012, a conference From Dynamics to Complexity was organised at the Fields Institute in Toronto celebrating his work.From Dynamics to Complexity - A conference celebrating the work of Shub In 2015 he was elected as a fellow of the American Mathematical Society \\"for contributions to smooth dynamics and to complexity theory.\\". Since August, 2016 he is Martin and Michele Cohen Professor and Chair of the Mathematics Department at City College of New York.  Work  Shub has produced publications in dynamical systems and in the complexity of real number algorithms. In his Ph.D. in 1967 he introduced the notion of expanding maps, which gave the first examples of structurally stable strange attractors. In 1974 he proposed the Entropy Conjecture, an important open problem in Dynamical Systems, which was proved by Yosef Yomdin for C^\\\\infty mappings in 1987. This same year Michael Shub published his book Global Stability of Dynamical Systems, which is often used as a reference in introductory and advanced books on the subject of Dynamical Systems.Wiggins, S. Introduction to applied nonlinear systems and chaos, Springer, 1990.Hasselblatt, B. and Katok, A. Handbook of dynamical systems, Vol I, Elsevier, 2002. He described jointly with Lenore and Manuel Blum a simple, unpredictable, secure random number generator, see Blum Blum Shub. This random generator is useful from theoretical and practical perspectives, see.Stinson, D. Cryptography: Theory and Practice, Third Edition, Taylor and Francis, 2005 In 1989 he proposed with Lenore Blum and Stephen Smale the notion of Blum‚ÄìShub‚ÄìSmale machine, an alternative to the classical Turing model of computation. Their model is used to analyse the computability of functions.Gradel, E. Finite Model Theory and Its Applications, Springer- Verlag, 2007 In 1993, Shub and Smale initiated a rigorous analysis of homotopy-based algorithms for solving systems of nonlinear algebraic equations which has inspired much of the work in that area during the last two decades.B√ºrgisser, P. and Cucker, F.Condition: The Geometry of Numerical Algorithms, Springer, 2013 Shub was one of the founders of the nonprofit association Foundations of Computational Mathematics, and editor of their journal Foundations of Computational Mathematics with the same name until 2009.

Design and development The L.66 was intended to be a low cost, easy maintenance two-seater. Thus a low power engine was required and the prototype was fitted with a Haacke HFM-2 flat twin, though other engines could be used. It was a cantilever parasol monoplane with an aerodynamically thick airfoil section wing, which had a simple, rectangular plan and significant dihedral. The wing was a wooden structure with two spars, the ailerons mounted directly to a rounded groove in the rear spar. It was linked to the upper fuselage by a rather complicated set of struts. Traditionally, Albatros had constructed fuselages with wood frames, but the L.66 marked a departure, with a welded steel tube longeron and strut framework covered with fabric. The sides were flat and almost airfoil-shaped, with a blunt, rounded nose and taper aft. The nose-mounted engine, driving a two-blade propeller, was raised above the fuselage with a fairing behind it, enclosing the oil tank and with the instrument panel attached to its rear. The fuel tank was in the wing centre section, feeding the engine by gravity. Further aft, pilot and passenger sat side by side in the wide fuselage; tandem controls could be fitted if required. The empennage was simple in shape and action as there were no fixed surfaces, only an all-moving rudder and elevator. Both control surfaces were balanced. The conventional undercarriage was also very simple, with the mainwheels attached to a single axle which passed through the fuselage, sitting the L.66 close to the ground. The tailskid was linked to the rudder for steering on the ground Operational history Prototype with Haake engine The first L.66 was flying in mid-1924 with the Haacke engine. In all ten were built. Variants ;L.66: Haacke engine. ;L.66a: Slightly larger and heavier, with Stahlwerk Mark St.M3 or Anzani engine. ;L.66c: ;L.67:Lighter version, Bristol Cherub or Anzani engine. Two built.

ACT-333679 or MRE-269, the active metabolite of selexipag Contraindications In Europe, use of selexipag together with strong inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP2C8, such as gemfibrozil, is contraindicated because it increases concentrations of selexipag twofold, and its active metabolite 11-fold, potentially leading to more adverse effects. Adverse effects The adverse effects of selexipag are similar to those of intravenous prostacyclins used for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Common side effects include headache and jaw pain. An increased risk for hyperthyroidism has also been noted in people taking selexipag. History The US FDA granted selexipag Orphan Drug status for PAH.

It was later broadened to include the documentation of World War II aircraft crash sites and the preservation of aviation relics related to the defence of Darwin during World War II. The original museum was first opened to the public in 1988. In the late 1980s, the Society negotiated with the United States Air Force (USAF) and the Northern Territory Government to obtain a surplus USAF Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber and to build a museum to house and display the aircraft.

However, due to the presence of asbestos in the airframes, the proposal was dropped. In 2018, the museum acquired a P-3C and looked into expanding their hangar space to house it.

Seen as one of the great leaders of the Muslim army, Qays ibn Sa'd was known for his steadfast defense in battles. His desire to cleanse his soul, achieved him the honor of being one of the great companions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Qays was also one of the most loyal companions of Ali ibn Abi Talib.Madelung, Wilferd. The Succession to Mu·∏•ammad: A Study of The Early Caliphate. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997. Print. pp. 152, 153, 190, 191, and 192Khalid, Muhammad Khali, and Khalid Muhammad Khalid. Men Around The Messenger. Kuala Lumpur: Islamic Book Trust, 2005. Print. pp. 276‚Äì280 Birth and early life Qay ibn Sa'd was born in Medina around the time of Muhammad. His father was Sa'd ibn Ubadah, the leader of the Kazrjah tribe (a tribe that was known for their generosity). Before converting to Islam, Qay's ibn Sa'd was cunning to the extent that no one was able to get the better of him. He would use his cunningness to short-change the people of Medina and its surroundings. = Conversion to Islam = After Sa'd converted to Islam, he introduced Qays to Muhammad. Sa'd tells Muhammad, :\\"This is your servant from now on.\\" Muhammad was pleased with the qualities that Qays possessed. Qays then sat down next to him. Muhammad then told Qays, :\\"This place will always be yours for the rest of your life.\\" When Qays embraced Islam, he completely changed his life, attitude, vision, and disposition. Through Islam, Qays learned how to treat people with sincerity and not to resort to deceit. He abandoned all his cunning in dealing with people and devoted himself to becoming a true and sincere Muslim. However, there were moments in his life (in difficult situations) where he was tempted to use his cunning abilities to deceive people. But, Qays's sincerity to the religion of Islam helped him overpower the temptations. Qays himself states, :\\"If it were not for Islam I would have used my craftiness to outwit all the Arabs.\\" :\\"If I did not hear the Prophet say craftiness and deceit reside in hell, I would have been the craftiest man of the nation.\\" Qays's title Qays was given the title al- Ansari.Daly, M. W., and Carl F. Petry, eds. The Cambridge History of Egypt. United Kingdom: Cambridge UP, 1998. Print. p. 68 Al-Ansari means the helper. Qays's characteristics Qays's family was known for their generosity. Even Muhammad praised them by stating, :\\"Generosity is the dominant trait of this family.\\" A pre-Islamic Arabian custom was that wealthy people would engage a crier (announcer) to stand on an elevated place during the day to call quests and passers-by to come to their house to eat food and rest. And at night the criers would light a fire in order to guide strangers to places where food was being served. People during pre-Islamic Arabia, would say, :\\"Whoever likes fat meat must go to Dulaym ibn Hartithan's house.\\" Dulaym was the great- grandfather of Qays. Being brought up in a family renowned for its generosity, Qays too would inherit the trait of generosity. Qays's generosity surpassed his cleverness. Qays was also known for his charity. It is documented that one day Abu Bakr and Umar stated, :\\"If we let this lad give free rein to his generosity, he would exhaust his father‚Äôs wealth.\\" When his father, Sa'd ibn Ubadah heard their comments he replied \\"Abu Quhaafah and Ibn al-Khattab should not have tried to encourage my son to become a miser.\\" To indicate Qays's generosity, Qays lent a person in debt (facing rough times) a large amount of money. When the time of repayment came the man went to pay back the money Qays had lent him. However, Qays refused to take the money back and stated, :\\"I never take back anything that I have given.\\" It is known that Qays was also sharp-witted and resourceful. Qays had characteristics of a leader except for a traditional Arab beard. The Ansar use to tease Qays by saying, :\\"If only we could buy him a beard.\\" Governor of Egypt Imam Ali had selected Qays ibn Sa'd to become the governor of Egypt. Wilferd Madelung in his book The Succession to Mu·∏•ammad: A Study of The Early Caliphate discusses the appointing of Qays ibn Sa'd as the governor of Egypt by stating, :\\"It was an act of reparation towards the Ansar and must have been seen by the Quraish opposition in Mecca as confirmation of their fear that Ali intended to abolish their privileged status as the ruling class in Islam.\\" Imam Ali chose Qays over Muhammad ibn Abu Hudhaifa, whom the Egyptian rebels looked as their leader and had control of al-Fustat. Madelung states, :\\"He (Imam Ali) did not feel indebted to the Egyptian rebels, who had returned home, as he did to al- Ashtar and the Kufans, and wished to keep at a distance from them.\\" He also rejected Amr ibn As, a supporter of Mu'awiyah, as a candidate even though Aisha demanded his restoration on the grounds of his popularity among the army of Egypt. Madelung also states, :\\"Amr's leading role in the agitation against Uthman, based on motives of self-interest rather than Islamic principles, could hardly have appealed to Ali. Amr was a type of unscrupulous opportunist with whom Ali did not want to burden his reign.\\" According to Sahl ibn Sa'd al-Sa'idi of the Khazraj tribe, :\\"Ali proposed to Qays ibn Sa'd that he choose a military guard in Median to accompany him, but Qays declined, stating that if he could enter Egypt only with a military escort he would rather never enter the country.\\" Qays then left with only seven companions and was able to reach al-Fustat without any worries/troubles. He also brought a letter from Imam Ali informing the Egyptian Muslims of his (Qays's) appointment and read it in the mosque. The letter was written in Safar 36 AH (July 656 AD), roughly two months after Imam Ali's accession by Ubaydullah ibn Abi Rafi. Imam Ali mentioned that Muhammad had first been succeeded by two persons, after whom a ruler (Uthman) had taken charge and introduced innovations such that the community protested and reproached him. Madelung comments, :\\"There was no mention of Uthman's violent death and of the part played by the Egyptian rebels. Ali evidently did not wish to touch the divisive matter.\\" After publicly addressing the letter, Qays then praised Imam Ali as the best man after Muhammad. He also received the bay'ahs (pledges of allegiance) for Imam Ali from the Egyptian people. As the governor, Qays did not take any major steps against Uthman's partisans, who had seceded to the village of Kharbita near Alexandria after the revolt of Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa. Uthman's partisans held out against Qays ibn Sa‚Äôd under their leader Yazid ibn al- Harith al-Maudliji of Kinana. They informed Qays that they wanted to see how matters developed. Furthermore, they stated that they would not interfere with his tax collectors and would not take up arms against him. Qays agreed to their request and did not try to force them to pledge allegiance (Uthman's partisans would later pledge allegiance to Mu'awiyah instead of Imam Ali). Maslama ibn Mukhallad al-Sa‚Äôidi, a kinsman of Qays, called for retaliation for the blood of Uthman. However, Qays assured Maslama that he did not wish to kill him under any circumstances. As a result, Maslama committed himself not to oppose Qays as long as Qays was the governor of Egypt. The agreement (with Uthman's partisans) allowed Qays to collect the tax throughout the land of Egypt. Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa and the Egyptian rebels were not mentioned in the accounts of Sahl ibn Sa‚Äôd. According to al-Layth ibn Sa‚Äôd, an Egyptian, Muhammad ibn Hudhayfa left Egypt for Medina when Qays was appointed governor in order to join Imam Ali. When news reached Mu‚Äôawiyah that Muhammad departed from Egypt and was on transit to Medina, he demanded his subjects capture Muhammad and bring him to Sham (Damascus). After Muhammad was brought to Damascus, Mu‚Äôawiyah imprisoned him. Muhammad managed to escape prison but was killed by Yemenis on Dhul Hijja 36 AH (May 657 AD). Military career =Shurta al-Khamis= Qays ibn Sa'd was the commander of Shurta al-Khamis, a military unit that supported Imam Ali and the Ahl al-Bayt in Iraq.Morony, Michael G. Iraq after the Muslim Conquest. Piscataway, New Jersey: Gorgias Press LLC, 2005. Print. p. 94 Shurta al-Khamis was composed of forty thousand men who personally were loyal to Imam Ali. =Battle of Siffeen= In the Battle of Siffeen, Qays sided with Imam Ali against Mu'awiyah. Qays joined Sahl ibn Hunayf, one of the governors of Imam Ali, as he was setting off to join Imam Ali at the Battle of Siffeen. Qays was appointed as one of the commanders of Imam Ali's army; he commanded the foot soldiers of Basrah.Ibn Abu Talib, Ali. Sermons from Imam Ali, Nahj al-Balagha. N.p.: Sohale Sizar, n.d. Print. pp. 67, 123, 124, and 181 Qays was given a brigade of over 10,000 men. On the sixth day of the Battle of Siffeen, Qays ibn Sa'd al-Ansari came forward with the army to fight against ibn Dhi'l-Kala and his contingent. Severe fighting ensued. During the war, Qays would sit and mentally concoct plots that would make Mu'awiyah and his army the worst losers. The more he thought about the plots, the more he realized that they were evil and dangerous. Qays reminded himself of Allah's holy words: :\\"But the evil plot encompasses only him who makes it.\\" (Sura Fatir 35:43) As a result, Qays discarded the plots and sought forgiveness from Allah. After Imam Ali's martyrdom Sulaym ibn Qays states: :\\"Mu'awiyah came (to perform) the hajj during his Caliphate. That was after the killing of Imam Ali, and after the Peace Treaty with Imam Hasan. The Medinans (people of Medina) received him. Among them was Qays ibn Sa'd, who was the chief of the Ansar (helpers) and the son of their chief. So a talk took place between them (Qays ibn Sa'd and Mu'awiyah).Aal-Yasin, Radi. Sulh Al-Hasan: The Peace Treaty of Al-Hasan. Qum, Iran: Ansariyan, 2000. Print.

Aviation Supplies & Academics, 1997. Characteristics =Sweep= Seen in plan the leading edge may be straight, curved, kinked or a combination of these. A straight leading edge may be swept or unswept, while curves or kinks always mean that part of the leading edge is swept. On a swept wing the sweep angle may differ from that of the wing, as wing sweep is conventionally measured at the airfoil 25% chord line. However on a delta wing the leading edge sweep defines the wing sweep. =Radius and stagnation point= A rounded leading edge helps to maintain a smooth airflow at varying angles of incidence to the airflow. Most subsonic airfoils therefore have a rounded leading edge. The degree of rounding is characterised by the profile radius at that point. The airflow divides to pass either above or below the wing. The stagnation point on the leading edge profile is the point at which the flow divides and there is no flow either up or down. As the angle of incidence varies, the stagnation point will move a little up or down accordingly. Airfoils optimised for supersonic flight have a sharp leading edge to minimise drag. Aircraft which must operate efficiently at both subsonic and supersonic speeds often compromise on a tightly-rounded leading edge. =Droop= When a wing is pitched up to a high angle of attack, the airflow above the wing can break away and the wing then stalls. Drooping the leading edge reduces the angle at which the airflow strikes the wing and helps to maintain smooth airflow and hence lift at higher angles and lower airspeeds. The problem is often most acute on the outer wing section near the tip, so leading-edge droop is often applied to the outer section only. Leading-edge droop can cause excessive drag in normal flight, so variable-position leading-edge droop flaps are sometimes used. An alternative to variable droop is the Krueger flap, which runs along below the leading edge and drops forwards and down when deployed to open a slot under the leading edge. =Thermal effects= In high-speed aircraft, compression heating of the air ahead of the wings can cause extreme heating of the leading edge. Heating was a major contributor to the destruction of the Space Shuttle Columbia during re-entry on February 1, 2003. Leading edge devices The leading edge of an aircraft wing may be equipped with one or more devices or extensions for various purposes: * Cuffs * Deicing boots * Flaps, including droop flaps and Krueger flaps * Leading edge root extensions (LERX) * Slats * Slots * Stall strips * Vortilon vortex generators Sail boats When sailing into the wind, the dynamics that propel a sailboat forward are the same that create lift for an airplane. The term leading edge refers to the part of the sail that first contacts the wind. A fine tapered leading edge that does not disturb the flow is desirable since 90% of the drag on a sailboat owing to sails is a result of vortex shedding from the edges of the sail. Sailboats utilize a mast to support the sail. To help reduce the drag and poor net sail performance, designers have experimented with masts that are more aerodynamically shaped, rotating masts, wing masts, or placed the mast behind the sails as in the mast aft rig.

It consists of a bandpass filter and an active amplifier, such as an OP-AMP or a BJT. The oscillator is commonly tuned to a specific frequency by varying the reactant of the feedback path within the circuit. An example is the Colpitts oscillator.  Properties  An oscillator is any device or system that produces a periodic output. In a tuned oscillator, the period of the output may be controlled by altering the system's resonant frequency. In the case of a tunable electronic oscillator, this is most commonly achieved by altering the circuit's capacitance. As with all oscillators, active-filter tuned oscillators adhere to the Barkhausen stability criterion, which states that the open-loop gain AŒ≤ must be equal or greater than one, which means magnitude AŒ≤ ‚â• 1 and the phase shift around the loop is zero or an integer multiple of 2œÄ: \\\\angle \\\\beta A = 2 \\\\pi n, n \\\\in {0, 1, 2,\\\\dots}\\\\,.Whenever the criterion is satisfied the circuit starts to oscillate. To make the circuit oscillate at a certain frequency, a frequency selective circuit is made to satisfy the above criterion at a particular frequency. These circuits are called timing circuits of the oscillators.

The club's name is commonly abbreviated as E.C. Pinheiros, or E.C.P. The full name of the club is Esporte Clube Pinheiros S√£o Paulo (E.C.P.S.P.). It is a part of the multi- sports club, Esporte Clube Pinheiros (E.C.P.) which among other sports, fields a men's professional basketball team. The club was originally known as Sport Club Germ√¢nia (S.C. Germ√¢nia). The club plays in the top-tier level Brazilian League, the NBB. History The club's parent athletic club, Esporte Clube Pinheiros, was founded in 1899, under the name Sport Club Germ√¢nia (S.C. Germ√¢nia). The club's name was changed to Esporte Clube Pinheiros (E.C.P), in 1941. In the 2005‚Äì06 season, E.C. Pinheiros participated for the first time in the professional first division of Brazilian basketball, but then failed to qualify for the single league that resulted from the merging of the conferences. In the 2008‚Äì09 season, Pinheiros joined the new top-tier level Brazilian league, the Novo Basquete Brasil (NBB), under the sponsored name, Pinheiros/Sky.2¬∫ Novo Basquete Brasil - Clubes Participantes , Confedera√ß√£o Brasileira de Basketball, (2010) The club finished 2nd in the FIBA South American League in 2011, and also finished 2nd in the InterLeagues Tournament in 2011 and 2012. In 2013, the team won its first international tournament, the most important tournament of Latin America, the FIBA Americas League, with two victories against the host team, Capitanes de Arecibo, of the Puerto Rican League, and the Argentine League club CA Lan√∫s. In the second round, Pinheiros also needed a Capitanes victory over the Brazilian League club, UniCEUB/BRB, the team that had eliminated Pinheiros in the two previous editions of the NBB. And it happened - the team from Puerto Rico, beat the defending three time Brazilian League champions, helping Pinheiros to win its first international title. Pinheiros thus qualified to play at the 2013 edition of the FIBA Intercontinental Cup, against the defending back-to-back EuroLeague champions, Olympiacos. Pinheiros lost the series two games to none, losing the first game by a score of 81‚Äì70, and the second game by a score of 86‚Äì69. Arenas E.C.

Early life He was the eldest son of George Ramsay, 1st Lord Ramsay of Dalhousie, by Margaret, daughter and heiress of George Douglas of Helenhill, brother to William Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton, and Robert, Earl of Buchan. He was chosen to represent the burgh of Montrose in the Scottish parliament in 1617 and 1621. On 21 July 1618 he obtained from the king a charter of the barony of Dalhousie and of the lands of Kerington, Midlothian (Reg. Mag. Sig. Scot. 1609‚Äì20, No. 704). He succeeded his father in 1629, and on the occasion of the coronation of Charles I in Scotland was admitted to the dignity of Earl of Dalhousie and Lord Ramsay of Kerington by patent dated 29 June 1633 to him and his heirs male. Wars of the Three Kingdoms Dalhousie was among those of the commissioners appointed for the subscription of the king's covenant who were Covenanters; and he subscribed the libel against the bishops presented the same year to the presbytery of Edinburgh. He signed the letter of the covenanting lords of 19 April 1639 to the Earl of Essex, and served as colonel in the covenanting army which took up a position on Dunse Law to bar the progress of Charles I northwards in the First Bishops' War. He also served as colonel in the covenanting army which on 2 August 1640 crossed the River Tweed and invaded England. At the parliament held at Edinburgh in November 1641 Dalhousie's name was inserted in the new list of privy councillors, to displace others chosen by the king. Dalhousie was engaged in the campaign in England in 1644, in command of a horse regiment, but in the autumn he was called out of England with his regiment to proceed to the north of Scotland to aid Argyll against Montrose. On 2 August 1645 Montrose's second son James, Lord Graham, who had been confined in Edinburgh Castle, was placed with Dalhousie to be educated. On 24 October 1646 Dalhousie was appointed to the office of high sheriff of the county of Edinburgh. On 4 May 1648 he was nominated colonel of horse for Midlothian, for the engagement in behalf of Charles I; but apparently did not accept the office, remaining a close partisan of Argyll. He was one of the fourteen nobles who attended the parliament of January 1649, when the severe act was passed against those who had taken part in the engagement. In March 1651 he was nominated by Charles II colonel for Midlothian. Later life For having sided with Charles II, Dalhousie was fined by Cromwell's Act of Grace of 1654. He died in November 1672. Family By his first wife, Lady Margaret Carnegie, eldest daughter of David Carnegie, 1st Earl of Southesk, Dalhousie had four sons and three daughters: *George, second earl of Dalhousie; *John, James, William; *Marjory, married to James Erskine, 7th Earl of Buchan; *Anne, married, first, to John Scrymgeour, 1st Earl of Dundee, and, secondly, to Sir Henry Bruce of Clackmannan; and *Magdalene, who died unmarried. By his second wife, Jocosa, daughter of Sir Alan Apsley, lieutenant of the Tower of London, widow of Lyster Blunt, son of Sir Richard Blunt of Maple Durham, Oxford, he left no issue.

He also considered work as a social worker but an artistic streak desperate for expression could not be ignored and he instead enrolled to study Visual Arts at the East Sydney Technical College where he had his epiphany and realized he had found his medium with a block of stone. ‚ÄúI developed an interest in the use of form very early on.

Samadhi sites are often built in this way to honor people regarded as saints or gurus in Hindu religious traditions, wherein such souls are said to have passed into mahƒÅsamƒÅdhi, or were already in samƒÅdhi (non-dualistic state of consciousness) at the time of death. rajas of Kutch and their courts, at Bhuj, Gujarat Samadhi is also used in Sikhism for the mausoleums of eminent figures, both religious and political. Examples include the Samadhi of Ranjit Singh in Lahore, and that of Maharaja Sher Singh near Lahore. Hindu equivalents are usually called chatri, although those for Maratha Empire figures also often use \\"samadhi\\". The forms of structure called \\"samadhi\\" vary greatly. The word is sometimes used for a memorial stele, also called paliya, a type of hero stone once common in parts of Gujarat and Sindh. It may be used for small memorial buildings such as open chatri, often placed around a temple. The tradition of India is cremation for most Hindu people at the time of death, while samadhi is generally reserved for very advanced souls, such as yogis and saints, who have already been \\"purified by the fire of yoga\\"Georg Feuerstein, The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra (Boston: Shambhala Publications, 2011 ), p. 308. or who are believed to have been in the state of samadhi at time of death. Samadhi may not involve cremation.

Hall, Sam Shepard and Don Johnson. The film takes place in 1980s Texas and is based on the novel Cold in July by author Joe R. Lansdale. Hall plays a man who kills a burglar, whose father (Shepard) subsequently seeks revenge. The plot is further complicated when a private investigator (Johnson) shows up. The project had a long gestation, and production did not begin until seven years after Mickle read the novel. Mickle and Damici had previously written about feminist themes in We Are What We Are (2013) and wanted to cover more masculine themes. Filming took place over 25 days in the Hudson Valley area of New York. It premiered at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. IFC Films theatrically released the film in North America on May 23, 2014, where it grossed $427,418. The film is \\"Certified Fresh\\" at Rotten Tomatoes and has an approval rating of 85%. It was released on DVD on September 30, 2014. Plot Ann Dane, startled by the sound of a door window breaking, wakes her husband, Richard. He accidentally shoots the intruder, identified as Freddy Russell, a wanted felon. Richard is shaken by the experience. Richard visits the cemetery on the day of Freddy's burial where Freddy's father, Ben‚Äîa paroled convict‚Äîaccosts Richard in his car, making a veiled reference to Richard's son, Jordan. Alarmed, Richard picks up Jordan from school and arranges for Ann to meet them at the police station. Though Ben follows him to his son's school, the police decline Richard's request for help. However, when the Danes arrive home to find their front door broken in, the family is put under police protection. Police are posted around the house, including one guard inside, hoping to catch Ben when he returns. It turns out that Ben never left and has been hiding in the house's crawlspace since the initial break-in. He emerges and knocks out the guard, goes into Jordan's room, and locks the door. When Richard is alerted to Ben's presence inside the house by the sound of water dripping from the open crawlspace hatch, he alerts the observing police and breaks down Jordan's bedroom door. Ben has already escaped out the window and to a nearby river, however, and is tracked to Mexico‚Äîwhere he is apprehended. The police invite Richard to the station to close the case, and, while there, Richard notices a wanted poster for \\"Frederick Russell\\", who looks different from the man he shot. Richard repeatedly attempts to point out the contradiction to officer Ray Price, but Ray dismisses this as a trick of memory due to shock and refuses to discuss the issue. Richard sees Ben taken away in an unmarked police car, which he follows. He sees the police forcibly remove Ben from the car, and inject him with an unknown substance, splash him with alcohol, and leave him on train tracks to die. Richard saves Ben from an approaching train. Ben at first does not believe Richard's claims that the man he shot was not Freddy. The two exhume Freddy's grave and Ben confirms that the body In the coffin is not his son. Ben notes that the man's finger tips have been cut off to prevent identification. Ray Price visits Richard at work and claims that Freddy changed his appearance to avoid capture, explaining the discrepancy in the wanted poster. Richard is visited by Jim Bob Luke‚Äîa private investigator known by Ben‚Äîwho says the name Fred Russell is tied to several widely circulated news stories about the killing of a burglar. Jim theorizes that after Freddy became involved with the Dixie Mafia, he was caught by Federal investigators, who faked Freddy's death and placed him in Witness Protection in exchange for information. Jim, Richard, and Ben learn that Freddy might be living in Houston under the name \\"Frank Miller\\". When they attempt to meet him at his new home, they instead find a number of home videos which turn out to be snuff films, one of which features Freddy Russell beating a woman to death with a baseball bat. Richard wants to take the tape to the police. Jim believes the police already know about the videos but are unconcerned because Freddy is far more valuable as an informant against the Dixie Mafia while the victims are illegal immigrants whom few will miss. Ben is so enraged by his son's actions that he is resolved to kill him at any cost. They track Freddy to a remote mansion where he and his associates are making another snuff film. They infiltrate the mansion and begin killing everyone they encounter. When Freddy is the last survivor, Ben hesitates to kill him, and Jim is shot. Freddy shoots both Richard and Ben before Ben finally wounds him. Ben declares himself as Freddy's father, shoots his son in the head, and dies from his own wounds shortly after. Jim and Richard set the mansion ablaze and escape with the hostage. The next morning Richard returns home to his family. Cast * Michael C. Hall as Richard Dane * Sam Shepard as Ben Russell * Don Johnson as Jim Bob Luke * Vinessa Shaw as Ann Dane * Nick Damici as Ray Price * Wyatt Russell as Freddy Russell * Lanny Flaherty as Jack Crow * Rachel Zeiger-Haag as Valerie * Brogan Hall as Jordan Dane Production =Development= Producers Linda Moran and Rene Bastian had an easier time of funding the film than Mickle's earlier work, as his reputation had grown; Moran said that they \\"worked on raising the money for this film for quite some time in every way we thought possible.\\" B Media Global, a division of French company, Backup Media, fully financed Cold in July. It is the first film to be fully financed by Backup Media. Already a fan of Lansdale, Mickle turned to reading through his stack of Lansdale novels for pleasure. When he read through Cold in July in just a few hours, he excitedly realized that he had not seen these elements in a film before and looked to adapt it. Mickle said the film was difficult to pitch due to how it constantly evolves and re- invents itself. In order to reassure financiers, Mickle described Korean thrillers that had succeeded with similar shifts in tone, but he says that he doubts that he convinced anyone. Mickle stated that he had difficulty getting the film made‚Äîit took seven years from when he first read the novel. The first draft of the script, a verbatim copy of the novel, was 220 pages long; from there, Mickle and Damici edited the script down to a more manageable size. The final script was also the furthest from the novel, but they felt it was closest in spirit. Lansdale said that he saw all the revisions of the script except for the last and \\"felt respected through the entire process.\\" Although the original book was not designed to be filmed, Lansdale said films had been a secondary influence on the story, and the story \\"certainly fits with film.\\" As they adapted the novella, they realized that their faithful scripts were much too long, which did not do justice to the novella's pacing and length. Eventually, they were able to edit it down by removing unnecessary dialog that could be replaced through body language. Changing the time period was never considered, as Mickle considered the themes of masculinity and manhood to come from a previous era that would not work in a more modern setting. Shepard also contributed to the script. Mickle and Damici had struggled with one particularly difficult scene and debated removing it entirely. When Shepard offered to rewrite it, Mickle gratefully accepted. Shepard returned with a single typewritten page and offered to run it by Damici, but Mickle said it was not necessary and accepted it as-is. Mickle and Damici were drawn to Lansdale's cross-genre style, as their own films were also cross-genre. Although primarily known for their work in horror films, Damici and Mickle said that they were more interested in storytelling and making good films, and Damici said that they can return to making horror films at any time. Mickle used Hall's character to ground the film so that audiences would not feel lost as the film crossed genres. Mickle wanted to avoid obvious genre categorization and predictability, as he felt that genre films needed to be shaken up. Buyers had previously encouraged him to re-cut one of his films so that audiences could easily identify the genre, limited to six subgenres, in the first ten minutes. Mickle said their advice \\"blew [his] mind\\". = Pre- production = In September 2013, Sam Shepard, Don Johnson, and Vinessa Shaw joined Michael C. Hall, who had already been cast. Because he played a killer on Dexter, Hall said that the script quieted any concerns he had about being typecast. Cold in July was filmed after Dexter ended, and Hall was drawn to the role based on his desire to play a more normal character; Hall called the role therapeutic, as it allowed him to move on from playing the iconic serial killer Dexter Morgan. The role further appealed to Hall for his character's lack of control over his own life, which contrasted strongly with the self- assured and in-control Dexter. Mickle cast Hall after having been a fan of both Six Feet Under and Dexter. Although Mickle had concerns that audiences would find Hall difficult to accept as an uncomplicated everyman, he believed Hall to be one of the best working actors. Hall further impressed Mickle with his off-screen personality, which was surprisingly normal and completely unlike his TV characters. Once Hall had been cast, Mickle said that the rest of the casting \\"fell in place from there.\\" Mickle had reached out to Shepard seven years earlier but heard that Shepard was retiring from acting. After Hall had been cast, however, Mickle once again contacted Shepard. Shepard expressed interest in the script, and Moran suggested casting Don Johnson, who had impressed Mickle with his recent film roles. When he read the script, Johnson said he was \\"taken by how it had different rhythms and tempos\\", and he \\"didn't know what the hell was going to happen by page ten.\\" = Filming and post-production = Mickle was influenced by Road House and the Korean drama Memories of Murder. After exploring feminist themes in We Are What We Are, Mickle wanted to explore more masculine themes in Cold in July. Mickle called Cold in July \\"the other side of the coin\\" to We Are What We Are; and a film about being \\"sucked into your own kind of action movie.\\" Mickle tried to work in many 1980s themes and references to John Carpenter's work from that period. After his previous films, Mickle had tired of city-based productions and was looking for something less urban. Shooting began in Kingston, New York on July 29, 2013. Locations included Esopus, Woodstock, and other Hudson Valley settings. It was shot using a Red Epic camera. Lansdale spent two weeks on the set and said he \\"loved it\\". Filming took 25 days, which Hall called \\"refreshing\\" compared to his long run on a TV series. Johnson based his character on a composite of people he knew. He did not read the source novel, as he wanted his performance to be based on the screenplay and untainted by echoes from the novel. Of Mickle, Johnson said that he was quickly impressed with the director's skill and enjoyed working with him. Hall finished his run on Dexter a week before filming began on Cold in July. Hall did not base his performance on Dexter, and he did not consciously think of parallels between Cold in July and Dexter during filming. Hall said that Mickle had a \\"welcoming, fun vibe\\" and was a \\"great leader\\", and he said that he would enjoy working with Mickle again. Long-time collaborator Ryan Samul worked closely with Mickle on the cinematography. They planned out the scenes in advance and used 3D graphics to visualize difficult shots. Cold in July was the first time Mickle worked with an editor instead of performing the job by himself. In an interview, he said that tight deadlines forced him to delegate the duties to a like-minded collaborator. He described it as \\"a weird experience\\" and an experiment. Mickle said that he never before had to cut scenes from his films during editing, but Cold in July was \\"a constant balance of shifting things, removing sub plots, and putting them back in different places.\\" The score was composed by Jeff Grace. Mickle and Grace had collaborated on several films previously, and they had earlier planned what kind of score they wanted for Cold in July. It was influenced by John Carpenter's scores. Samuel Zimmerman of Fangoria also describes an influence from Sam Peckinpah's 1980s work. Lansdale's daughter, musician Kasey Lansdale, appears on the soundtrack.  Release  This film made its premiere and competed in the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. IFC Films announced that they acquired North American rights to the film in a deal estimated at $2 million, and they released the theatrical and video on demand through IFC \\"movies on the same day as theatrical release\\" May 23, 2014. It grossed $40,317 on its opening weekend and $427,418 total in North America. Icon Productions released it in the UK, where it grossed another $682,258. The film was selected to be screened as part of the Directors' Fortnight section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. MPI Home Video released it on home video in the United States on September 30, 2014. Video sales grossed $525,260 in North America.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that Cold in July received positive reviews from 85% of 102 critics surveyed; the average rating was 7/10. The consensus is: \\"Boasting plenty of twists, a suitably seedy tone, and a memorable supporting turn from Don Johnson, Cold in July proves an uncommonly rewarding thriller.\\" Metacritic rated it 73/100 based on 30 reviews. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"Jim Mickle continues to show that he's among the most distinctive genre filmmakers on the indie scene with this cracked but flavorful thriller.\\" Kyle Smith of the New York Post called it a midnight movie that is \\"good, but not a scorcher.\\" Film Threats Brian Tallerico rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"Any issues with the actual narrative fall away when one considers the risk-taking here.\\" Andrew O'Hehir of Salon.com called it \\"tense, gripping, gruesome, often hilarious, brilliantly engineered and highly satisfying.\\" At Twitch Film, Todd Brown called it \\"a remarkable bit of work from one of the brightest lights on the American indie scene.\\" Rodrigo Perez of Indiewire wrote that the film is initially irritating and contrived, but it becomes \\"far better than it has any right to be and perhaps, more significantly, is unusually absorbing and memorable.\\" Scott Foundas of Variety described it as \\"a modest, unpretentious exercise in old-fashioned thrills and chills, made with a level of care and craft that elevates it well about the fray.\\" Stephen Holden of The New York Times called it a \\"pulpy neo-noir\\" film that \\"goes gleefully haywire.\\" Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Tense and violent, it grabs you from the first moments and rarely loosens its hold until the last body drops.\\" Writing in Slant Magazine, Ed Gonzalez rated it 2.5/4 stars and called it a \\"compulsively watchable\\" film that eventually \\"falls into a rabbit hole of tiresome plot machinations\\". A. A. Dowd of The A.V. Club rated it B‚Äì and wrote that it \\"thrillingly shuffles genres, before settling on a dumb one\\". Although he criticized the frequent shifts in tone, Mark Kermode of The Guardian rated it 3/5 stars and praised the film's attention to detail. Noel Murray of The Dissolve rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote that though the film is unpredictable, it has little new to say.

It is operated by Abellio Rail NRW hourly. History In the summer of 2001, DB Reise&Touristik; abandoned InterRegio line 22, which ran from Frankfurt on the Ruhr‚ÄìSieg railway to D√ºsseldorf (until the summer of 1999 to M√ºnster), continuing once a day to Norddeich Mole). The RE 16 (Ruhr-Sieg-Express) service was established to replace it from the timetable change of 10 June 2001 by the transport association of the Rhine-Ruhr, Ruhr-Lippe and Westfalen- S√ºd. The newly created service ran initially via Siegen to Au (Sieg); this branch was taken over in December 2002 by the RB 95 (Sieg-Dill-Bahn) service operated by Deutsche Bahn and operated since December 2004 under the brand name of DreiL√§nderBahn. In 2004, the operations of the RE 16 was tendered together with the RB 40 (Ruhr-Lenne-Bahn), RB 56 (Der Iserlohner) and RB 91 (Ruhr-Sieg-Bahn) services as the Ruhr-Sieg network. The tender was won by Abellio Rail and the operations of the tendered lines was awarded for twelve years from 9 December 2007. Since the commencement of Abellio services, Welschen Ennest has been added as a stop. As a result of the reductions in regionalisation funds, a change to weekend services was implemented at the 2007/2008 timetable change: as well as the normal RB 91 services, RE 16 services stop every 2 hours either at Meggen or Kirchhundem and at either Littfeld or Eichen from 4 pm or 5 pm to 8 pm on Saturdays and all day to 8 pm on Sundays. Because of this scheme, these four stations are served more often on Saturdays than on other days. Moreover, RE 16 services in the weekday peak towards Essen serve all stations between Siegen and Hagen. In the evening weekday peak RE 16 services from Essen serve all stations between Hagen and Siegen. Route The Ruhr-Sieg-Express runs daily every hour and utilises four railway lines built by the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company: *the Ruhr line from Essen to Witten, using the long-distance tracks, which is also used by regional and long-distance trains, *the Elberfeld‚ÄìDortmund railway from Witten to Hagen *the Ruhr‚ÄìSieg railway from Hagen to Siegen and *the Letmathe‚ÄìFr√∂ndenberg railway from Iserlohn-Letmathe to Iserlohn.  Coupling/uncoupling in Iserlohn-Letmathe  A special feature of the service is the coupling and uncoupling of trains at Iserlohn-Letmathe. The trains from Iserlohn and Siegen are coupled in Iserlohn-Letmathe and run together via Hagen, Witten and Bochum to Essen. In the opposite direction the trains run coupled to Iserlohn-Letmathe, where they are separated with one section running to Siegen and the other to Iserlohn. Even the trains that run from/to Iserlohn, now carry the designation of RE 16, the former Iserlohner Bahn (‚ÄúIserlohn railway‚Äù) service now no longer exists as a separate service. The service to Siegen is usually made up of a three-part Stadler FLIRT set and the service to Iserlohn is usually made up of a two-part FLIRT set. On weekends the service to Iserlohn-Letmathe is operated as a three-part set, with a one or two part FLIRT continuing to Siegen and the rest going to Iserlohn.  Future  There are plans, with the start-up of the Rhine-Ruhr Express (RRX) network planned for 2020, for the Ruhr-Sieg-Express and the Ruhr-Lenne-Bahn services to run between Essen and Bochum on the S-Bahn route via Wattenscheid- H√∂ntrop instead of on the main line via Wattenscheid. The Ruhr-Lenne-Bahn would then run via Essen-Steele rather than Essen-Kray S√ºd. NRW regular interval timetable The Ruhr-Sieg-Express is operated under the integrated regular-interval timetable of North Rhine-Westphalia, called NRW-Takt, under which trains arrive at major interchange stations at roughly the same time in order to facilitate transfers. To supplement services in parallel with the Ruhr-Sieg-Express, two Regionalbahn services are operated, the Ruhr-Lenne-Bahn (RB 40) between Essen and Hagen and the Ruhr-Sieg-Bahn (RB 91) between Hagen and Siegen/Iserlohn. Due to the different number of intermediate stops for the different services, the combined services only provides stops at stations served by the express trains at approximately 30-minute intervals. In Siegen, the Ruhr-Sieg-Express has regular-interval connections with the Rhein-Sieg- Express (RE 9) towards Cologne, the Sieg-Dill-Bahn (RB 95) to Au (Sieg) and Dillenburg, as well as the Main-Sieg-Express (RE 99) to Gie√üen, continuing every two hours to Frankfurt. There are other connections in Iserlohn to the Ardey-Bahn (RB 53) to Dortmund and in Finnentrop to the Biggesee-Express (RB 92) to Olpe. In Iserlohn-Letmathe, it is a possible to change from services from Siegen to services to Iserlohn and vice versa each hour. Coming from Siegen/Iserlohn on the RE 16, it is possible to change in Hagen to the Volmetal-Bahn (RB 52) to Dortmund and L√ºdenscheid, the Maas-Wupper-Express (RE 13) to Hamm and Venlo, the Sauerland-Express (RE 17) to Warburg and long distance services to Bremen/Hamburg and Hannover/Leipzig. Rollingstock A FLIRT set of Abellio in Essen Hbf, here running as RB 40: Ruhr-Lenne-Bahn In the early days of the Ruhr-Sieg-Express it was mainly operated with class 425 electric multiple units, but later the rollingstock used varied considerably. So sometimes two class 426 EMUs were coupled, sometimes a class 425 and a class 426 set were coupled and sometimes singled sets were operated. Occasionally a triple set of class 426 was operated, which sometimes caused problems. In the last weeks before the change of operator, this often occurred, as the class 425 sets were no longer used. The use of both classes ended at the timetable change on 9 December 2007, when Abellio Rail NRW took over operations on the line with two-and three-part Stadler FLIRT EMUs. The contract with Abellio runs until December 2019.

His surname is sometimes spelt as Gregorie, the original Scottish spelling. He inherited Kinnairdy Castle in 1664. Three of his twenty-nine children became mathematics professors. He is credited with inventing a military cannon that Isaac Newton described as \\"being destructive to the human species\\". Copies and details of the model no longer exist. Gregory's use of a barometer to predict farming-related weather conditions led him to be accused of witchcraft by Presbyterian ministers from Aberdeen, although he was never convicted. Ancestry and early life Gregory, born on 20 December 1625, was the second- eldest son of John Gregorie (1598‚Äì1652), minister at the small parish village of Drumoak in Aberdeenshire, where Gregory was born. The family surname is sometimes spelt Gregorie, as in the original Scottish. His mother was Janet Anderson, whose father David was said to be exceptionally talented in the fields of medicine and mathematics. Gregory's younger brother was James Gregory, the designer of the Gregorian telescope. Gregory's schooling was initially undertaken by his mother. His father then despatched him to the Netherlands to learn herring dealing, which was the predominant trade in Aberdeen. He returned to Aberdeen when he was in his early thirties in 1655 just after his father's death. Gregory had never been enthusiastic about trading and ceased trading as soon as he returned to Aberdeen to concentrate on scientific and literary topics. From 1663 until 1669 he was employed by Marischal College Library as a librarian. At that time he also furthered his scientific interests by writing to other overseas and British scientists. In February 1655 Gregory married Jean Walker, with whom he had fifteen children. When his elder brother Alexander died childless in 1664, Gregory inherited Kinnairdy Castle, just south of Aberchirder, Banffshire. Alexander had been murdered. Jean Walker died in 1671 and Gregory remarried a few months later in early 1672. His second wife was Isabel Gordon. She bore him fourteen children. Twenty of his children reached adulthood and three, David (1659‚Äì1708), James (1666‚Äì1742) and Charles (1681‚Äì1754), were mathematics professors in the same period at British universities. David taught at the University of Oxford; James was based at Edinburgh University; and Charles at St Andrews. Thomas Reid was Gregory's grandson, as Reid's mother was Margaret, Gregory's daughter. Reid's father was Lewis Reid, a minister at Strachan, Aberdeenshire. Kinnairdy Gregory moved to Kinnairdy Castle with his wife and children as soon as he inherited the estate and lands from his elder brother in 1664. The inheritance was substantial and made him a rich man. Although he knew nothing about farming, he settled well and helped others in the area, whether they were rich or poor, with his medical prowess and did not charge for his medical advice. David corresponded with Edme Mariotte who shared an interest in atmospheric pressure and its measurement for meteorological prediction. In fact, David was suspected of witchcraft until he explained how he used a barometer for weather forecasting. Gregory passed the control of the castle and lands to his son David in 1690, who was by then the Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford. This divestiture enabled Gregory and his wife to move back to Aberdeen. Legacy and death Aided by an Aberdeen watchmaker, Gregory began designing a military cannon and showed the prototype to his son David. The model was then passed to Isaac Newton. The model was destroyed on Newton's advice and Gregory's grandson, Thomas Reid, reported that Newton had considered it to be \\"destructive to the human species\\". No records or details of the model have been found by historians. To avoid the troubles of the Jacobite Rebellion, Gregory and his family went back to the Netherlands in 1715. They returned to Aberdeen a few years later. Gregory then worked on writing a journal but it was not published. He died aged ninety-five years in 1720.

Fabian, 1937 - at the University of Amsterdam Album Academicum website is an emeritus professor of Anthropology at the University of Amsterdam. His ethnographic and historical research focuses on religious movements, language, work, and popular culture in the Shaba mining region of Zaire (present-day Democratic Republic of the Congo). His theoretical and critical work addresses questions of epistemology and history in anthropology, notably the influential book Time and the Other (1983), which has become a classic in the field of anthropology. Johannes Fabian was born in the German town of Glogau (which is now in Poland). He began his university studies in Bonn in 1956, and then moved on St. Gabriel Mission House in M√∂dling, Austria to study theology. His experiences in Austria led him to study anthropology in Munich, before undertaking a master's degree (1965) and PhD (1969) at the University of Chicago. After receiving his PhD, he took up appointments at a series of universities: in 1968 at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois; in 1973 at the University of Zaire; in 1974 at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut; and finally moved to the University of Amsterdam in 1980, where he was a professor and chair of the department of cultural anthropology until his retirement in 2002. During this time he had visiting appointments in Bonn, Cologne, and Paris. His ethnographic research focuses on religious movements in Zaire and Congo. Fabian is most famous for his book Time and the Other: How Anthropology Makes its Object (1983), a classic in the field of anthropology that had changed the way that anthropologists think about their relationship with the people they study and is an important work of postcolonial critique within anthropology. As the blurbs on the book put it, the book is \\"a radical epistemological critique of anthropological writing\\" (George Marcus, University of California, Irvine) and \\"Time and the Other is a critique of the notions that anthropologists are 'here and now,' their objects of study are 'there and then,' and that the 'other' exists in a time not contemporary with our own.\\" His 1996 work, Remembering the Present: Paintings and popular history in Zaire was made in collaboration with the Congolese artist Tshibumba Kanda-Matulu.

Career Evans was best known for a burlesque parody she performed as Marilyn Monroe. Evans entered show-business as a model and later chorus girl before becoming a star dancer. By the early 1950s she was a headlining burlesque star on the West Coast when approached by producer Harold Minsky with a promise of steady work in his chain of theaters if she adapted her stage persona to that of then-rising star Marilyn Monroe. At first Evans objected but soon agreed. Like other strippers of the time period (including Lili St. Cyr and Jennie Lee), Evans was extremely well known in nightclubs and was largely under-paid. Evans's Monroe-burlesque act was the dancer's gimmick. Several other dancers also parodied female stars and noted historic women. Her acts parodied Monroe's films and known aspects of Monroe's life. In real life Evans was three inches bigger in her breast than Monroe: Evans (est. 40-26-34) and Monroe (est. 37-24-35). According to the reporters, Evans looked very like Monroe. When Monroe died in 1962, Evans prepared a tribute show which was well received by critics and audiences. Evans soon came to feel disturbed by being sometimes mistaken for the dead star and curtailed the act, replacing it with a parody of Irma La Douce. Evans was still a draw, but the burlesque she loved was drying up and as she entered her late thirties she retired from performing and helped run the entertainment at a resort facility. Upon the death of her close-friend and dancer Jennie Lee in 1990, Evans took over the annual reunion meetings of the Exotic Dancers League Lee had helped found and the burlesque collectible museum, Exotic World, later Burlesque Hall of Fame that Lee had owned and run. In 1991, Evans began to produce annual fundraising shows to support the museum and its holdings. The museum consisted of hundreds of items used in burlesque entertainers' acts over the years and was moved from its original location in 2005 and 2006. Evans had returned to modeling in the late 1980s and resumed performing during the first dozen years of the events, later limiting herself to on-stage addresses. Her last full-fledged Monroe impersonation may have been at the 2002 Tease-O-Rama event where she mimicked Monroe's performance of \\"Runnin' Wild\\" from the film Some Like It Hot. She also gave numerous tours of the museum at its original location and would recite bits of her old Monroe acts in her uncannily accurate Monroe soundalike voice for attendees. Death Evans died in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the age of 86.

It belongs to the swing family of American vernacular dances that arose in the 1920s and 30s. It is believed that the dance originated within the African American community‚ÄùNice People Suddenly Get the Urge to Become Vulgar‚Äù The Afro American 14 June 1941. 1[Research credit: Ryan Martin] of the Carolinas in the 1920s,The Rebirth of Shag. Dir. Ryan Martin. Vimeo. 2014 .‚ÄúShag Latest Dance‚Äù Blytheville Courier News (Arkansas) 25 July 1929: 5 [Research credit: Forrest Outman] later spreading across the United States during the 1930s. Because the basic step takes up such a small space, the Shag can also be danced to fast music (over 300 beats per minute). The shag is still danced today by swing dance enthusiasts worldwide. The Steps In the 1930s \\"shag\\" became a blanket term that signified a rather large family of jitterbug dances (swing dances) that all shared certain characteristics. The most notable of these characteristics are (1) a pulse that's consistently held up high on the balls of the feet (a.k.a. a \\"bounce\\" or \\"hop\\" to match every beat in the music) and (2) footwork with kicks that reach full extension on the off-beat (even beats) rather than the on-beats (odd beats) as with most other dances that were popular at the time. Dance instructors from the swing era often grouped the different shags into three rhythmic categories: single rhythm, double rhythm, and triple rhythm shag. The different names are intended to denote the number of 'slow' steps (e.g., a step, hop combination) performed during each basic. The slow steps were then followed by two 'quick' steps (e.g., a step, step combination). Today, shag enthusiasts and swing dance historians also recognize an additional shag rhythm that has come to be known as \\"long double- shag\\".The rhythmic variations described here were not unique to shag. See Clendenen, F L. Dance Mad or the Dances of the Day. St. Louis, Mo: Arcade Print Co., 1914. and McDougall, Thomas. \\"The Foxtrot: And other Gossip from the States.\\" Dancing Times. Oct. 1914. This rhythmic variation is identical to double-shag except that it has four quick steps rather than two. It has been traced to Charlotte, NC, at least as far back as 1936, where it co-existed with the triple and single-rhythm variations.Jean Foreman. Interview.The Rebirth of Shag. Dir. Ryan Martin. Vimeo. 2014 . It is commonly believed that double-rhythm shag evolved somewhat later than the others, originating in either New York or New Jersey in the mid-1930s. And, though double-shag is the most popular form of collegiate shag today, single-rhythm shag is believed to have been the dominant rhythmic pattern during the swing era. Described below is double-rhythm shag, which uses a \\"slow, slow, quick, quick\\" pattern. And unlike the other three rhythmic patterns, which all have eight or sixteen counts in their basic, the double-rhythm basic has six counts. The basic step is danced in a face-to-face (\\"closed\\") but offset position (i.e., the lead and follow are chest to chest, but their orientation to one another is offset in such a way that the feet are not toe-to-toe but alternate like the teeth of a zipper). Partners stand close, with the lead's right hand positioned on the follow's back. The follow's left arm then rests either on the lead's shoulder or draped around their neck. It was also common for partners to have an exaggerated hand-hold (i.e., the way the lead's left hand and arm are positioned as he hold the follow's right hand) where the arms are held high in the air. Depending upon the height of each partner, the couple may have their arms pointed straight up. This was not always practiced, but it is understood to be one of shag's distinctive features. Some dancers prefer to hold the arms much lower, similar to conventional ballroom positioning. Finally, the follow's footwork usually mirrors the lead's. Note: Step (in the description below) is defined as: a weight shift to the opposite foot while hopping (this is usually minimal; almost more of a slide than a literal hop). Hop is defined as: a lift-and-plant motion on the same foot. The planted foot is the foot with the dancer's weight on it. *The Shag Basic: (from the lead's point of view) Beat 1: STEP onto left foot, beat 2: HOP on left, beat 3: STEP onto right foot, beat 4: HOP on right, beat 5: STEP onto left foot, and beat 6: STEP onto right foot. The movement during beats 5 and 6 is often described as a shuffling motion. As mentioned above, this is usually broken down verbally as \\"slow, slow; quick, quick\\" where the 'slows' cover two beats (or 'counts') each and the 'quicks' mark a single beat (or 'count') each. Hence, for the lead this would be two counts with the weight on the left leg while the right leg moves, two counts with weight on the right leg while the left leg moves, followed by a quick step onto the left and then a quick step onto the right. The follow's movement would be the exact opposite. *Cross Kicks: (done with the partners positioned side-by-side) the same movement as the basic but where the non-planted foot kicks on each slow, and where the quick-quicks are done with one foot behind the other (in tandem). *Breaks (a.k.a. Shag Dips): A step and hold action where the non-planted leg is extended fully and the planted leg is bent underneath the dancer for support (hop onto left, leaving out the step; hop onto right, leave out the step; step left and step right) *The Basic Shag Turn: it is customary for most turns in shag to be executed on counts 5 and 6 (i.e., the quicks-quicks). The most common turn is executed from closed position on the last two beats of the basic (5‚Äì6) with the follow traveling clockwise. The lead executes this by using their right hand (on the follows back) to lead the follow to turn on counts 5 and 6. Partners then return to closed position on the first count of the next basic. [Apache (a.k.a. \\"Texas Tommy\\") turns are also common in shag.] Name \\"Shag\\" itself (when used in reference to American social dances) is a very broad term used to denote a number dances that originated in the first half of the 20th century. Today, the term \\"collegiate shag\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"shag\\" to refer to a particular style of dance (i.e., the dance covered in this article) that was popular amongst American youth during the swing era of the 1930s and 40s. To call the dance \\"collegiate shag\\" was not as common during the swing era as it is today, but when the \\"collegiate\\" portion was tacked on (as it was with other vernacular dances of the time) it was meant to indicate the style of the dance that was popular amongst the college crowd. The identification of a particular variant as 'collegiate' probably had its roots in a trend that sprang up in the mid-1920s, where collegiate variations of popular dances began to emerge.

The name \\"collegiate shag\\" became somewhat standard in the latter part of the 20th century (see swing revival), presumably because it helped to distinguish the dance from other American vernacular dances that share the \\"shag\\" designation. Carolina shag, which evolved from a dance called the Little Apple, and St. Louis shag, which is believed to have been an outgrowth of the Charleston, both adopted the name shag‚Äîthough neither one of them is directly related to the shag that's the focus of this article. History Unfortunately, shag's origins are not very clear. Descriptions of the dance in literature from the time period suggest it began in the SouthWright, Dexter and Anita Peters. How to Dance. The Blakiston Company, 1942. 187. as a 'street dance', meaning it did not initially evolve as part of the curriculum taught by a dance master or in a dance studio. Nevertheless, a particular version of the shag was eventually adopted by the Arthur Murray studios where it was standardized in the late 1930s. Publications from the era testify to shag's popularity throughout the country during the 1930s. They also clue us into the fact that, despite its enormous popularity, the dance itself wasn't universally known by the name \\"shag\\", which only makes tracing its origins more difficult. Arthur Murray's book Let's Dance reports that shag was known throughout the United States under various names, like \\"flea hop\\".Murray, Arthur. Let's Dance. S.l.: Standard Brands Inc, 1937. 27. And by the late-1930s there were arguably a hundred or more stylistic variations of the dance.Powell-Poole, Helon. \\"The Carolina Shag.\\" American Dancer, Jan. 1936: 13. Print. In the 1935 book entitled Textbook of Social Dancing, Lucielle and Agnes Marsh tell us that, \\"At the most exclusive Charleston Colonial Ball we found the debutantes and cadets doing what they call the Shag. This is a daring little hop and kick with sudden lunges and shuffling turns. As we followed our survey through the South we found the same little, quick hop, skip, and jump under the names of Fenarly Hop and Florida Hop. Through the West the same steps could be traced under the names of [the] Collegiate, Balboa, and Dime Jig.\\"Marsh, Agnes L. Textbook of Social Dancing. New York: Fischer, 1935. preface pg VI.

The earliest known reference to a dance called \\"shag\\" can be found in a book entitled The Land of the Golden River by Lewis Philip Hall, published in 1975. In this book, the author claims to have invented a dance he named \\"the shag\\" in 1927.

Interview. The Rebirth of Shag. Dir. Ryan Martin. Vimeo. 2014 . As the section above points out, the naming practices of the time were often inconsistent. Two dances with the same name may not necessarily share the same origin story or even look alike. Carolina shag and St Louis shag, two dances that both became popular in the late 1940s and 50s, provide a perfect example of this complication. Both came to be called \\"shag\\", though they have very different origin stories. So, although it is possible that the dance that Lewis Hall and his partner invented somehow gave rise to the shag of the swing era (i.e., what we call \\"collegiate shag\\" today), this possibility could also be granted to a number of other seemingly unrelated dances from the late 1920s or early 1930s, some of which might not have even been called shag. Like Charleston (dance) and Big Apple (dance), the shag originated among African Americans‚ÄùNice People Suddenly Get the Urge to Become Vulgar‚Äù The Afro American 14 June 1941. 1[Research credit: Ryan Martin] in the 1920s, where again, it may or may not have actually been called \\"shag\\".Lance Benishek and Jean Foreman.

It has also been suggested that the dance evolved from a partnered version of the solo Vaudeville/tap step called \\"flea hop\\", which featured a movement pattern that's very similar to shag [Citation Pending].

It is generally regarded as his best symphony and the most frequently performed and recorded today.Joachim Raff: Symphony No. 5 Lenore It was inspired by Gottfried August B√ºrger's ballad Lenore, set during the Seven Years' War. The symphony came during a time of great success for Raff. He already achieved fame with his Third and Fourth symphonies, as well as the opera Dame Kobold, so the orchestras were eager to perform it. The premiere took place in December 1872 at a private performance in Sonderhausen in front of an audience of 20. The first public performance took place in Berlin the following year and it was very well received. The work was performed in other places in Germany, as well as England and America. Ebenezer Prout reported that at the English premiere \\"those who were present will remember the sensation created by its performance\\". Raff described the symphony's programme: \\"The happiness of two lovers is interrupted by war. The time has come when he must go forth with his fellow soldiers and she remain behind alone. In this solitude evil forebodings take possession of her; she falls into a fever, in which her hallucinations prepare, in reality, only for her own death\\".  Instrumentation  The symphony is scored for piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, snare drum, triangle and strings. In 2014 Chandos released a CD recording of the symphony played by L'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande conducted by Neeme J√§rvi.

Battle =Origins= After the revolt of Gordian I and Gordian II and ascension of Balbinus and Pupienus, Maximinus marched on Rome. He reached the city of Aquileia, expecting an easy victory: the city's walls had long been in disrepair. However under the leadership of senators Rutilius Pudens Crispinus and Tullus Menophilus, the walls were repaired and the city rallied to defend itself in a siege. According to Herodian: > These two had seen to everything with careful attention. With great > foresight they had brought into the city supplies of every kind in > quantities sufficient to enable it to withstand a long siege. An ample > supply of water was available from the many wells in the city, and, a river > flowing at the foot of the city wall provided both a defensive moat and an > abundance of water.Herodian, Roman History, 8.2 accessed 6 August 2013 =The Siege= Maximinus' Pannonian legions attacked the walls of the city but were unsuccessful. Maximinus sent envoys to negotiate a surrender, but Crispinus persuaded the town to refuse.Herodian, Roman History 8.3 accessed 6 August 2013 Maximinus' forces besieged the city but found it more difficult than originally thought. Herodian: > They launched numerous assaults virtually every day, and the entire army > held the city encircled as if in a net, but the Aquileians fought back > determinedly, showing real enthusiasm for war. They had closed their houses > and temples and were fighting in a body, together with the women and > children, from their advantageous position on the parapet and in the towers. > In this way they held off their attackers, and no one was too young or too > old to take part in the battle to preserve his native city.Herodian, Roman > History, 8.4 accessed 6 August 2013 The Aquileians had plenty of food and good morale; they also used weapons to better effect, such as pouring oil on soldiers trying to climb the walls. Herodian: > The army of Maximinus grew depressed and, cheated in its expectations, fell > into despair when the soldiers found that those whom they had not expected > to hold out against a single assault were not only offering stout resistance > but were even beating them back. The Aquileians, on the other hand, were > greatly encouraged and highly enthusiastic, and, as the battle continued, > their skill and daring increased. Contemptuous of the soldiers now, they > hurled taunts at them. As Maximinus rode about, they shouted insults and > indecent blasphemies at him and his son. The emperor became increasingly > angry because he was powerless to retaliate. Unable to vent his wrath upon > the enemy, he was enraged at most of his troop commanders because they were > pressing the siege in cowardly and halfhearted fashion. Consequently, the > hatred of his supporters increased, and his enemies grew more contemptuous > of him each day. =Ending= Maximinus' soldiers began to lose heart. In addition to being unsuccessful in battle, their supplies were cut off and soldiers began to starve. Their only source of water was a nearby river, into which the Aquileians had thrown corpses, rendering it unfit to drink. Rumours began to circulate that armies against Maximinus were forming elsewhere and were on their way to fight them. In early May 238 there was a lull in fighting. Soldiers of the Legio II Parthica (usually based at the castra Albana), decided to assassinate the emperor and his son Maximus and end the siege: > The conspirators went to Maximinus' tent about noon.

DYA infrastructure  DYA Infrastructure Landscape DYAInfrastructure is a method that aims to support the infrastructure architect. It brings business agility, architectural effectiveness and manageable and expandable infrastructure landscapes within the grasp of any organization. DYA infrastructure provides three mutually supportive elements: # A definitive description of infrastructure architecture as an integral part of the architectural process, and how it helps enforce architectural principles‚Äîwith two focal points: defining a functional approach to infrastructure facilities and how to select and work with the appropriate quality attributes # The building blocks model (an architectural meta-model for infrastructure) that... ## Creates and describes logical, modular infrastructure facilities ## Maintains a categorical and functional inventory of existing infrastructure \\"landscapes\\" ## Structures and constructs architectural products, like reference architecture, impact analyses, and project start architecture # Best practices to help begin infrastructure architecture smoothly, and guidelines for producing essential architectural artifacts that make infrastructure architecture work Various implementation strategies are outlined, how to extend the Project Start Architecture is explained and the importance of a number of products such as Reference Architectures, Product Catalogs and Service Catalogs are also illustrated. Apart from these three main ingredients, DYAInfrastructure also provides guidance on how infrastructure architecture can improve security, project management, test management and production. = Background = In 1972, Gerrit BlaauwGerrit A. Blaauw (1972) \\"Computer Architecture\\", Elektronische Rechenanlagen, Vol 4, p. 154-159 described how one could think about computer design as separable domains: architecture, implementation and realization. However, the concepts introduced by Blaauw do not hold just for mainframe architecture, but also for IT architecture (and arguably for all forms of architecture). When working with DYAInfrastructure, one can readily recognize the three domains as put forward by Blaauw: * Architecture : Blaauw argued that, \\"The architecture of a system can be defined as the functional appearance of the system to the user, its phenomenology.\\" When discussing the architecture of an infrastructure facility, we limit ourselves to the essentials: what does it do? To this end, we regard the facility as an infrastructure service, compounded of basic, atomic infrastructure functions. Atomic infrastructure function in this respect means a logical infrastructure function that cannot be meaningfully subdivided into sub-functions‚Äîat least not meaningfully for architectural purposes. :When infrastructure functions are described in generic terms, apart from any technical implementation, they look identical for most organizations. Similarly, when infrastructure services are composed out of basic infrastructure functions, they also look identical between organizations. And this is precisely what one would expect on an architectural level, according to the definition by Blaauw. * Implementation : Blaauw argued that \\"The implementation is the logical structure which performs the architecture. Where the architecture tells what happens, the implementation describes how it is made to happen.\\" In any organization, an infrastructure service must be delivered within one organization specific context, or possibly multiple of these. These contexts influence the way in which an infrastructure service must be delivered. For instance, a Ministry of Defence PC in an office in the capital looks different from a PC in the back of an armoured personnel carrier on the battlefield. This is because the context battlefield imposes different requirements on the infrastructure facility than the context office. :Thus, implementing an infrastructure service means: ** Identifying the contexts and their requirements in which the service must operate ** Locating the infrastructure functions that are part of the service in these contexts ** Specifying them to a level of detail that can account for the identified requirements At the implementation level, infrastructure services and functions can still be kept generic. There is no need to propose specific products or technical standards (although this is possible). However, because of the influences of the contexts, services and functions can often be organization-specific. Note that with the previously presented definition of infrastructure architecture, both the Blaauw \\"architecture\\" and \\"implementation\\" are subject to the infrastructure architect. * Realization : Blaauw argued that \\"The physical structure, which embodies the logical design, will be called the realization. Here, the 'which' and 'where' of component selection, allocation, placement and connection will be considered separate from the 'how' of the logical structure.\\" Realization of an infrastructure service is the field of infrastructure designers and engineers. It is their responsibility to create from the implementation a facility that is both feasible and maintainable (including the cost aspect of both). In this phase, infrastructure designs are created and the facilities actually get built. = The DYA infrastructure architecture process = Business, information and infrastructure architectures share a common goal: to provide optimum support for an organisation's operations. This is impossible without input from, and feedback between, the three architectural disciplines. To act effectively within the architectural process and at the same time be sufficiently responsive, each discipline must follow the dynamics and structures which underline their own respective area of competence. This certainly applies to infrastructure architecture, which must make its role easily recognisable by clarifying the terms it uses within the infrastructure domain. The easiest way to do this is to describe infrastructure solutions in logical and functional terms. DYAInfrastructure defines the \\"capability\\" of a solution with a set of quality attributes. Quality attributes also have an important role in harmonizing the architectural process across the three architectural disciplines, because regardless of the underlying (technological) structure, quality attributes can be reconciled across the domains and be used throughout the entire solution. At the same time, they also provide input for the engineering, creation and testing of solutions within their own area of competence. That is why quality attributes are a recurring theme throughout the different phases and activities of infrastructure architecture and why it is of the utmost importance to choose and define quality attributes carefully. At the very least, they must illustrate the unique and inherent quality of an infrastructure solution.  Quality attributes for communication  Cooperation between architecture disciplines demands mutual understanding and agreement on Quality Attributes used The architectural disciplines must be able to adjust to each other whenever necessary during the architectural process without compromising themselves. They should make clear what they can contribute and indicate their own limits. The full scope of wishes and requirements can not always be fulfilled; particularly if they (even minimally) conflict with each other. Should one of the disciplines want or need to dictate the eventual outcome, it should receive appropriate guidance from the architectural process, keeping in mind that the guidance must be relevant to the specific area of competence. The architectural process selects quality attributes most realistic and appropriate for the direction of the desired solution. This set of quality attributes can be seen as a mandate for each discipline to individually work on their own part of the total solution. Quality attributes ensure the resulting solutions are not developed in isolation, but that they remain consistent within the complete architectural framework. Quality attributes also provide a way to check and report on delivered results. To stop disciplines talking at cross purposes, unequivocal agreement is needed on the quality attributes each discipline brings into the architectural process. These must serve as a basis for further reconciliation and harmonization of definitions within the architectural process. Infrastructure architecture provides its own set of quality attributes, alongside the specific quality attributes of the business and information architectures. Apart from the quality attributes, there are two major restrictions that influence the potential direction of a solution, namely cost and time. These restrictions are imposed by the outside world (usually by the organization) and affect all forms of architecture. Time and money are generally the most important determinants of the scale and quality and thus feasibility of a solution. In many cases, time and money are so restrictive that a different weighting must be given to a number of quality attributes to come up with a realistic solution. As a result, the architectural process occasionally and justifiably turns into a debate between stakeholders, resulting in a solution that, optimally, serves all organizational interests within the confines of time and money.  Quality attributes for infrastructure architecture  Quality attributes are by nature abstract, because they indicate how but not what. Within the architectural process, relationships are identified between the quality attributes from one discipline and comparable quality attributes in another discipline. This makes it easier to identify how choices made in one area influence solutions in other areas. The more pro-actively this occurs and the more quality attributes that can be reconciled, the more constructive the process. Within this harmonization process, \\"similar\\" quality attributes are easily traceable to each other, while others are far more likely to underline the uniqueness of a particular discipline. Nevertheless, a discipline usually recognizes itself in the quality attributes of other disciplines, provided that they have been properly defined and explained. Keeping in mind the objective of building the infrastructure function as a utility, there are three categories, with two quality attributes each, that express the inherent quality of infrastructure solutions: * Flexibility (adaptability and scalability); * Reliability (availability and integrity); * Maintainability (manageability and accountability). The six quality attributes defined here do not apply exclusively to infrastructure applications, but they are the guiding set for building infrastructure as utility. Participants in the architectural design process are not always sufficiently aware of the importance of the quality attributes of their own fields of expertise, and consequences that their explicit requirements have on other areas. Other participants must then explain the implicit or explicit consequences for their own domain. For example: a certain business architecture solution requires 99.99% availability. Infrastructure responds that they can meet this requirement in terms of availability, but it creates significant consequences in terms of scalability and cost. Business architecture is then expected to indicate whether, in that light, the specified availability requirement is still justified. A situation must be avoided where disciplines impose quality attributes and terms on each other purely to achieve their own goals while disregarding other disciplines, because it is utterly counter-productive and thwarts the architecture process itself. Quality related terminology within one discipline often means something else, or even nothing at all, outside that discipline's domain. = DYA infrastructure decomposition and modeling = 3D Graphic of the Building Blocks Model This Infrastructure Architecture Repository contains architecture & design guidelines in the form of construction models at various levels and from various angles. It is constructed by making use of one of the most important tools of DYAInfrastructure: The Building Blocks Model. The first thing you should know about the Building Blocks Model is that it is primarily a decomposition tool. That means that it is used to dissect infrastructure landscapes into logical dimensions and parts to enable structured and methodological modeling (composition). It's like defining the Periodic Table first, to subsequently practice chemistry in an orderly fashion. The Building Blocks Model dissects the infrastructure landscape from five directions: * Working Areas * Environments * Building Blocks * Elements * Quality Attributes The decomposition order that is imposed by the model can be described as follows: * An infrastructure landscape consists of several Working Areas (Storage, Network, Server, Middleware, Client Realm). * Within each Working Area, some kinds of infrastructure functionality reside (Building Blocks), for example: ** the Working Area Storage offers a Centralized Storage facility, ** the Network Working Area offers Access and data Distribution facilities and ** the Client Realm Working Area provides PC's, Mobile PC's, Printers, Scanners and other facilities that serve as an interface to end-users. These facilities (Building Blocks) \\"live\\" in an Environment, that means that they are used in a certain business context and that the way of usage that is dictated by this context demands specific quality requirements. Examples of Environments within the Client Realm Working Area are Office, Kiosk and Remote. Within each Environment, quality demands are denoted by Quality Attributes with a value that is fitting to that Environment. On their turn, these values correspond to classes, provisions and/or permutations that are relevant to that Quality Attribute. Applied to building blocks in a certain environment, the architectural process designates universal standards to a building block for that environment. These standards (technical components) are elements in the building block model.

The location for the new school was \\"Church-Green-Hill-zone House\\" which was purchased in 1859. The priest responsible for the initial preparations of the new school was Fr Crouzet, a French marist priest. At that time, the college consisted of a primary and secondary School for boys, which catered for both boarding and day pupils but many changes have taken place through the years. In 1983, the boarding section of the college was closed, followed in 1987 by the closure of the primary school. In 1989, the first lay principal was appointed and in 1990, the college opened its doors to girls. Since its opening, there have been many extensions to the original Church-Hill House and additions to the buildings to meet the changing needs of the students. In 2011, the college celebrated its 150th anniversary where each student was presented with a special commemorative badge and a prayer book.

This custom is very old and is spread throughout the country, being practiced mainly by children. Sorcova is also used to describe the object that characterizes this custom. It consists of a stick or twig decorated with artificial flowers of different colors, wherewith children slightly hit on back their parents or acquaintances in the morning of New Year, wishing them, in special verses, health and luck. When they begin to say the verses, sorcova is inclined in the direction of the person to whom they address all wishes, sorcova playing the role of a magic wand, endowed with the ability to transmit health, youth and fertility to the vised one; verses are very suggestive in this regard. The text of sorcova, reminiscent of a spell, merely reinforces the movement of sorcova.  By region  This custom varies depending on the ethnographic region. In northern Transylvania, children go with sorcova from house to house, wishing health in exchange for local delicacies (cozonac, colac, apples, nuts). Girls are not allowed to go with sorcova, because they bring bad luck. An interesting form of custom can be found in the west of the country (village of Bucium, Bihor County). Children have a fir tree branch decorated with tinsel, candies and »õingƒÉlƒÉu (bell). Whoever does not have a fir tree can go with a stick wrapped in tinsel, on which are held three or four »õingƒÉlƒÉi. When they enter the house, those with fir tree sing and those with the stick hit rhythmically the floor after melody. Commonly, every child has his sorcova. While reciting, sorcova is moved in the rhythm of versification, sometimes marked by the sound of the bell.  Etymology  The term of sorcova comes from the Bulgarian word surov (tender green), allusion to the budded twig, broken from a tree, especially a fir tree. Some etymologists consider that sorcova derives from the Slavic word sorok≈≠ (forty): the recitative of sorcova consists of 40 syllabic groups corresponding to the 40 touches of sorcova.

Artist's impression of neutron stars merging, producing gravitational waves and resulting in a kilonova A kilonova (also called a macronova or r-process supernova) is a transient astronomical event that occurs in a compact binary system when two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole merge into each other. Kilonovae are thought to emit short gamma-ray bursts and strong electromagnetic radiation due to the radioactive decay of heavy r-process nuclei that are produced and ejected fairly isotropically during the merger process. History The term kilonova was introduced by Metzger et al. in 2010 to characterize the peak brightness, which they showed reaches 1000 times that of a classical nova. They are to the brightness of a typical supernova, the self-detonation of a massive star. The first kilonova to be found was detected as a short gamma-ray burst, SGRB 130603B, by instruments on board the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Explorer and KONUS/WIND spacecrafts and then observed using the Hubble Space Telescope 9 and 30 days after burst. In October 2018, astronomers reported that GRB 150101B, a gamma-ray burst event detected in 2015, may be analogous to the historic GW170817, a gravitational wave event detected in 2017, and associated with the merger of two neutron stars. The similarities between the two events, in terms of gamma ray, optical and x-ray emissions, as well as to the nature of the associated host galaxies, are considered \\"striking\\", and this remarkable resemblance suggests the two separate and independent events may both be the result of the merger of neutron stars, and both may be a hitherto-unknown class of kilonova transients. Kilonova events, therefore, may be more diverse and common in the universe than previously understood, according to the researchers. Theory The inspiral and merging of two compact objects are a strong source of gravitational waves (GW). Kilonovae are thought to be progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and the predominant source of stable r-process elements in the Universe. The basic model for neutron star mergers was introduced by Li-Xin Li and Bohdan Paczy≈Ñski in 1998. Observations First kilonova observations by the Hubble Space Telescope. The first observational suggestion of a kilonova came in 2008 following the short-hard gamma-ray burst GRB 080503, where a faint object appeared in optical and infrared light after one day and rapidly faded. Another kilonova was suggested in 2013, in association with the short-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 130603B, where the faint infrared emission from the distant kilonova was detected using the Hubble Space Telescope. On October 16, 2017, the LIGO and Virgo collaborations announced the first simultaneous detections of gravitational waves (GW170817) and electromagnetic radiation (GRB 170817A, SSS17a) of any phenomena, and demonstrated that the source was a kilonova caused by a binary neutron star merger. This short GRB was followed by a longer transient visible for weeks in the optical electromagnetic spectrum (AT 2017gfo) located in a relatively nearby galaxy, NGC 4993.

Early years Kennedy was born in Huttonville, Ontario, near Brampton, on 3 April 1892. When he was ten years old, his family moved to Chicago. At the age of seventeen he obtained work with the Great Northern Railway as a freight brakeman. He joined the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen in 1910. In 1911 he moved to Calgary, Alberta, where he worked for the Canadian Pacific Railway as a switchman. At the start of 1912 Kennedy moved to Minneapolis, working as a switchman for the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway. He became president of BRT lodge 625 in Minneapolis. From 1921 to 1935 he was chairman of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway grievance committee. In 1935 he was made a full-time union officer, responsible for the northwest United States and for Canada west of Port Arthur, Ontario. He handled representation disputes from 1944 to 1946. At the start of 1947 he was appointed General Secretary and Treasurer. Union leader Alexander F. Whitney, president of the union, died of a heart attack on 16 July 1949 at the age of 76. Kennedy succeeded him as president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, and held this post until 1963. He was 57 years old when he became president. On 25 August 1950 President Truman issued an order for the federal government to take control of the 131 major railroads in the United States. The order came three days before the members of the BRT and the Order of Railway Conductors, were scheduled to halt work. Truman had just ordered U.S. troops to intervene in the Korean War, and could not afford to have the railways paralyzed. The strike continued until May 1952, when the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, the Order of Railway Conductors and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen accepted the government's terms and returned to work. Kennedy predicted that freight yards would become increasingly automated using new electronic technology. The railroads were in good financial condition, so could afford increased levels of investment, and there were large savings to be made. The Brotherhood reached its greatest size in 1956, with 217,176 members, after which railroad employment began to decline. In 1957 the BRT affiliated with the AFL‚ÄìCIO and the Canadian Labour Congress. At the 1959 AFK-CIO convention the question of racial discrimination came up. A. Philip Randolph said the federation should not tolerate segregated locals, even when the members were black and wanted to remain segregated. He was attacked by the organization's president, George Meany, who accused Randolph of trying to suppress the views of the black unionists. Randolph introduced a resolution to eject the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen from the AFL-CIO unless they changed their constitutions to allow black members. Kennedy said he would work to eliminate bias from the trainmen's union, and said that there were already over a thousand black members even though the constitution theoretically barred them. Kennedy supported Senator Harley M. Kilgore in his push for stronger laws for detaining subversives. He wrote to him on behalf of the Brotherhood to express their \\"deep appreciation of your efforts in Congress to counteract the activities of Communists and other subversive groups.\\" In 1958 Kennedy turned down an invitation from the Teamsters to discuss a unified transportation union. The Brotherhood held a lengthy convention in the Cleveland Music Hall between 4 January 1960 and 18 February 1960. Jimmy Hoffa of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters had representatives trying to influence the delegates to support unification of all labor unions. The combined union of road, rail and airline transport workers would have had immense power, and probably would have been prevented by the government. However, Kennedy was strongly opposed to working with Hoffa. Kennedy retired at the end of 1962 at the age of 70. President John F. Kennedy sent him a message that was read at his testimonial banquet: \\"Congratulations for your splendid record as President of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen; and good wishes for many years of enjoyable retirement.\\" Charles Luna succeeded W.P. Kennedy as president in 1963.

SN2 Palmitate in human milk  Fats in human breast milk provides about 50% of the energy needed for the development and growth of a newborn infant. About 98% of the fats provided by human milk are in the form of triglycerides, which themselves are molecules consisting of mixtures of three fatty acids bonded to sn-1, sn-2, and sn-3 positions of a glycerol backbone.Giovannini, M., E.

The positioning of palmitic acid at the sn-2 position is conserved in all women, regardless of race or nutrition, unlike the general fatty acid profile of human milk.  SN2 Palmitate in infant formula  The development of the sn-2 Palmitate structured triglycerides enables the mimicking of both the composition as well as the structure of human milk fat. Vegetable oils that are commonly used as source for infant formula fat have the opposite structure where the palmitic is located mainly at sn-1 and sn-3 positions.

Clinical studies in preterm and term infants, as well as preclinical animal model studies, show that enrichment of infant formula with sn-2 Palmitate results in increased fat absorption, reduced calcium soaps formation and stool hardness, increased calcium retention and larger skeletal mineral deposition.Carnielli, V.P., et al., Feeding premature newborn infants palmitic acid in amounts and stereoisomeric position similar to that of human milk: effects on fat and mineral balance. Am J Clin Nutr, 1995. 61(5): p. 1037-42  Physiology of triglycerides absorption  Triglyceride digestion by endogenous lipases leads to hydrolysis of fatty acids from the triacylglyceride sn-1,3 positions, to release two fatty acids and one sn-2 monoglyceride into the intestinal lumen.Mu, H. and C.E.

The fatty acids configuration on the triglyceride has a major contribution to the efficacy of this nutrient absorption. While the unsaturated and short chain saturated free fatty acids are well absorbed regardless of their position,.Tomarelli, R.M., Meyer, B.J., Weaber, J.R. & Bernhart, F.W.

Built on the same close quarter combat-tech as War of the Roses, War of the Vikings delivers the next generation of Paradox's close quarter combat focused brands that moves the setting to the Viking Age. All of these factors enabled us to create a game experience that has an increased intensity, improved accessibility, and more intuitive combat experiences ensuring you‚Äôre always presented with interesting choices.\\" War of the Vikings was released on 15 April 2014. On 2 October 2014 Paradox Interactive announced they would stop development of the game after 2 patches to increase stability and solve some major issues. On 28 February 2017 the servers were shut down and the game is not playable anymore.  Gameplay  Saxons fight Vikings at the docks. ‚Äò‚ÄôWar of the Vikings‚Äô‚Äô puts the player in control of a single soldier fighting for either the Vikings or the Saxons. The player will be able to define the game character profile by choosing everything from armour style, heraldry, shield paintings, beards, armour, weaponry and perks. The game plays mainly in a third-person viewpoint and is a multiplayer game. So far, the player can choose from 5 character classes:. Warrior (Medium Class): An all- around warrior with medium armor, with a sword and shield, and throwing axes. Champion (Heavy Class): Heavily armored, with charged up attacks whose two- handed axe deals a lot of damage. Skirmisher (Light Class): A ranged fighter who picks off enemies with a longbow, but carries a light axe for close- quarter combat. Shield Maiden (Medium Class): A defensive front liner with spear, javelin and the Snowflake shield. Berserker (Light Class): A fast, dual wielding fighter with two swords. Melee attacks are a right, left swing and overhead. Each melee weapon also has a special attack which does a large amount of damage if it connects but will leave the attacker vulnerable while the animation plays. There are 5 game modes, each of which can be played by up to 64 players. Arena is a single life game mode in a small map, when a player is ‚Äòdowned‚Äô they can be killed by the attacker hitting them where they lay or resurrected by a team mate. Pitched Battle is the larger version of a single life game mode, suitable for clan battles. TDM game mode where the player can respawn however each full death counts towards the score (a resurrected player does not count as a death for the game score). Conquest is a multiple life game mode where the teams battle to advance one objective at a time. Domination is another multiple life game mode where all objectives are available and must be held simultaneously to win.  Reception  The game's reception was mixed with a 62 on Metacritic.http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/war-of-the-vikings/critic-reviews  References   External links  * Official website via Internet Archive Category:2014 video games Category:Early access video games Category:Fatshark games Category:Hack and slash games Category:Multiplayer video games Category:Paradox Interactive games Category:Video games developed in Sweden Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Video games set in the Viking Age ","title":"War of the Vikings"},{"id":"40168067","text":"Watford Central, a planned London Underground station in the centre of Watford, Hertfordshire, was to be the terminus of a proposed extension of the Metropolitan line from the present-day Watford tube station to the High Street opposite Clarendon Road. The proposed station booking hall has long gone, however, the facade was retained and a new building constructed behind it. It is now The Moon Under Water public house. History Approximate routes proposed in 1927 for the Met line extension to Watford Central Building a line to Watford had been an ambition of the Metropolitan Railway Company for several years. Watford was already served by the LNWR main line, but Watford Urban District Council began to lobby the MR to extend their line into the town. By 1911 Watford had grown enough to make a new railway connection seem commercially viable. At this time, the MR shared tracks with the Great Central Railway (GCR) and these companies had formed the Metropolitan and Great Central Joint Railway; together they drew up plans to construct a branch line to Watford town centre, receiving Parliamentary approval in 1912. In the original plans, the Metropolitan line was to terminate at a passenger station located on Hempstead Road, close to the northern end of the High Street, with a goods station a mile further south at Cassiobury Park Avenue. The Urban District Council had recently purchased parts of the Cassiobury Estate from the Earl of Essex to create Cassiobury Park and were opposed to the MR driving a railway across their beautiful municipal park and objected to this scheme. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 hampered the project's development, and it was not until 1922 that construction of the Watford branch commenced. By this stage, the GCR was financially less secure and the MR instead formed a joint committee with the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), the Watford Joint Committee. Opposition from local politicians to the Cassiobury route meant that the terminus had to be sited next to the new goods yard in the Cassiobury area of the town, some distance from the centre. Watford station opened as the terminus of the Metropolitan Railway Watford branch in 1925. The MR was keen to promote its new destination as part of its Metro-Land advertising campaign; posters published by the MR in 1925 promoting the new route \\"by Metro to Watford\\" depicted an illustrated view of Watford High Street on market day, belying the remote location of the station. While the MR was able to provide a shuttle bus service from its station to the town centre, the Metropolitan branch line passenger numbers compared unfavourably with rival services into central London offered by the LMS and the UERL Bakerloo line from the more centrally located and stations. The LNER pulled out of the venture after the General Strike of 1926. Watford Met station The remote location of Watford Met station was clearly proving to be unsatisfactory, and the MR drew up plans to extend the line into the town centre. In 1927 the company purchased a property at 44 Watford High Street, the Empress Tea Rooms and Winter Gardens. A strip of land behind the property provided about 2.5 acres, enough for redevelopment as a railway station with a High Street frontage. Parliamentary approval given in 1929. The MR put forward alternative routes for the line extension: *Route 1, extending the line directly beyond the existing terminus and entering a tunnel under Cassiobury Park, Cassio Road, West Hertfordshire Sports Ground to the new station. *Route 2, branching off from the existing railway line just south-west of the original Met station and entering a straight tunnel under the Watford Grammar School for Boys playing fields, Cassio Road, and the West Hertfordshire Sports Ground to the High Street terminus. Neither scheme was enacted and neither tunnel was built. The terminus was to remain at its Cassiobury location The building The property purchased by the Metropolitan Railway at 44 High Street is located on the western side of the street close to the junction with Clarendon Road. The original building was named Derby House, and after extensive refurbishment in 1916 which included refacing of the frontage and the addition of two medallions of Queen Victoria, the rear garden was opened as The Empress Winter Gardens and Tea Lounge. The premises still stand today and have local listed building status, although the elaborate Winter Garden buildings which once stood behind the property have been demolished. For a brief period in 1921, the Winter Gardens served as a makeshift cinema, serving teas to patrons in the intervals. After acquisition by the Metropolitan Railway in 1927, 44 High Street was let out to a succession of tenants and eventually passed to the Lewis Omnibus Company, which was itself taken over by the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933.Horne p.96 In the following years, the building was used as a furniture shop and later it became a branch of the clothing retailer, Next. Today the building is occupied by Wetherspoons as The Moon Under Water public house. Metropolitan line extension Croxley Rail Link In 2011, more than 80 years after the MR first attempted to extend its line into central Watford, a new scheme was approved to continue the Metropolitan line across the town to Watford Junction station. This Metropolitan line extension is also known as the Croxley Rail Link.https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/improvements-and- projects/metropolitan-line-extension A disused stretch of former British Rail track which ran to Croxley Green station would be reinstated, connecting the Metropolitan line with the Watford DC Line at (London Overground) and sharing track to the terminus at Watford Junction. The project was to be funded jointly by Hertfordshire County Council and Transport for London. Had this project gone ahead, Watford tube station would be closed to passengers. On 25 January 2017, the Watford Observer newspaper published an update on the Croxley Rail Link confirming work had stopped as there was an ongoing funding issue.http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/15047214.UPDATE__Met_Line_extension__Mayor_confirms_work_has_stopped/ See also *Watford and Edgware Railway *Watford DC Line References * Category:Unbuilt London Underground stations Category:Proposed London Underground stations ","title":"Watford Central tube station"},{"id":"40168069","title":"1916 United States presidential election in Vermont"},{"id":"40168071","text":"The Kingwood Tunnel, near Tunnelton, West Virginia, was built between 1849 and 1852 by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad on its main line between Baltimore, Maryland and Wheeling, West Virginia, under the supervision of B&O; chief engineer Benjamin Henry Latrobe, II. At the time of its completion the tunnel was the longest tunnel in the United States until it was surpassed by the Blue Ridge Tunnel in 1858. Workers were recruited from coal mines in the area to excavate the tunnel. Three vertical shafts were established to allow work in two directions from each shaft, and from either end, using eight headings. The shafts were about deep and measured about by . The hoists were operated using horses. The tunneling operations used black powder as explosive. Dangerous rock conditions at the east end of the tunnel and accidents with black powder caused many casualties, with a total of about 30 deaths and 300 injuries in the excavation of the Kingwood Tunnel and the contemporaneous Board Tree Tunnel on the same line. The west portal of the original tunnel in 1974 Although the tunnel itself was completed in 1852, track was not laid, due to problems with the east entrance. A temporary switchback track, requiring reversal at each stage, was built to provide service until the tunnel was finished. Work began in 1854 on an arched liner using prefabricated sections of iron, faced with stone against the eventual deterioration of the iron liners. of this system were used at the east end, and another of the tunnel were lined with brick. Lining work, followed by track laying, was completed in 1858. It was completed with two tracks, but the increasing size of rolling stock necessitated a conversion to single track after 1865. Grouting and underpinning work was required in 1889 through the entire length of the tunnel, and additional brick lining was later installed in the section with iron liners. The single-track tunnel was bypassed by a double-track tunnel in 1912. The new tunnel's east portal incorporated the old east portal, and the original tunnel continued in service. The old bore was abandoned and sealed in 1962.

Believed to date from 1596 this Elizabethan manor house was built by James Meade, a local landowner. However it wasn‚Äôt until it was extensively remodelled in the mid-19th century that it became known as Narborough Hall. It is notable because of its construction from local pink granite. The property was first listed in 1952 and the following years saw a sad decline, culminating in a threat to demolish the house in the early 1970s. When the current owners Paul and Wendy Broadley bought it in 1976 it was a dilapidated wreck. Years of extensive renovation followed, much of the work undertaken by Paul himself, and the Hall was brought back to its former glory. To help the funding of this considerable undertaking and the maintenance of the house, the Broadleys opened the front rooms of the house as a shop in 1992. Now run by Paul and Wendy‚Äôs daughter and son-in-law Sophie and Simon, the shop has grown in size and now occupies five rooms on the ground floor. The Meade family Family tree of the Meades of Narborough James Meade (1555-1616) built Narborough Hall in about 1600. He was the only son and heir of William Meade (1500-1582) a wealthy landowner of Gratton Hall in Horton. In 1582 he married Mary Rodes and the couple had five sons and six daughters. When James died in 1616 his eldest son Henry Meade (1590- ) became the owner. Henry married in 1609 Ann Croft, the daughter and coheir of William Croft of Peckleton.The history and antiquities of the county of Leicester, Vol 4, Part 2, p. 818. Online reference When her father died in 1613 Ann inherited part of the Peckleton Estate and this was passed through successive generations of the Meade family until 1785. Henry‚Äôs eldest son William Meade (1610-1664) was the next to inherit Narborough Hall. He became a barrister and was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1631. In 1637 he married Elizabeth Petty, the daughter of Charnell Petty of Tetsworth. His eldest son Charnell Meade (1644-1712) who was also a barrister inherited the house when William died in 1664. In the same year he married Elizabeth Hewitt, the daughter of William Hewitt of Stretton. The couple had a son and a daughter. Their son William Meade (1668-1714) who had married Susanna Floyer in 1699 inherited the house in 1712 when his father died. However he only lived for two years after this so his eldest son William who was eleven years old at the time became the heir. Upon gaining his majority William Meade (1703-1736) took control of Narborough Hall. In 1731 he married Elizabeth Wilson (1708-1779) who was the daughter of Reverend Edward Wilson. The couple had a son Christopher and a daughter Susanna. William died in 1736 at the age of only 33 leaving his property to his wife Elizabeth. She married in 1737 Reverend John Vann, the curate of Narborough.Transactions - The Leicestershire Archaeological and Historical Society, Volume 7, 1893, p. 179.

The T-40 was designed for plowing light soil, processing row crops, mowing, plowing snow and for transportation. To achieve these goals, it has a carrier transmission and rear axle, a more rigid connection between the engine and the transmission case, increased diameter of the rear drive wheels, smaller front guide wheels and stiffer suspension than other tractors. Its durability has enabled many of the tractors produced in the 70's - 80's to remain in operation. Spare parts are still being produced.  Features  The T-40 was produced by the Vladimir Tractor Plant. The tractor has four-cylinder four-stroke diesel air-cooled engine: D-37 37 hp or D-144 50 hp. Depending on configuration, an electric starter or a gasoline starting engine (PD8), were used to start the diesel engine. It was manufactured in four-wheel drive (T-40A) and rear-wheel drive versions. It has an adjustable gauge and adjustable ride height on all wheels. The T-40 can be fitted with removable rear wheels of reduced width to work in aisles. In order to work on steep slopes, the track width can be increased by installing the rear wheels inside out. The T-40 had a completely reversible manual transmission, allowing the use of the full range of speeds both forward and backward. A bevel gear was placed immediately after the clutch and a mechanical or hydrostatic reduction gear, which enabled it to operate at low (less than 2 km / h) speeds. It had two PTO shafts - rear and side. These features, as well as its good performance, led to the tractor being widely adopted throughout the USSR. The engine is air-cooled which reduces the risk of overheating and freezing.  Modifications  Tractors with D-37 and D-144 (some sources D-37e) engines had differently shaped hoods.

There are a number of traditionally itinerant or travelling groups in Europe who are known as \\"Travellers\\" or \\"Gypsies\\". The origins of the indigenous itinerant groups are unclear. They have been assumed to have taken up the travelling lifestyle out of necessity at some point during the Early Modern period but to not be ethnically distinct from their source population. However, recent DNA testing has shown that the Irish Travellers are genetically distinct from their settled counterparts, and more groups are being studied. Many groups speak their own language or dialect (distinct from the settled population); it is often a blend of the local settled language and Romani language, even in non- Romani groups. The largest of these groups are the Romani people, who have Indian roots and heritage, who left India around 1,500 years ago entering Europe around 1,000 years ago; this includes the Sinti people, who are themselves the second largest group. The third largest group in Europe is the Yenish, an indigenous Germanic group. As opposed to nomads who travel with and subsist on herds of livestock, itinerant groups traditionally travel for trade or other work for the sedentary populations amongst which they live.  Indigenous Dutch Travellers (Woonwagenbewoners)  Indigenous Dutch Travellers (Known as Woonwagenbewoners, which translates to Caravan Dwellers) are first mentioned in the 1879 census, although they were present before then. They traditionally travelled around and practised traditional professions, like chair bottomers, tinsmiths, broom binders, traders, peddlers, artisans, etc.Gypsies and Other Itinerant Groups: A Socio-Historical Approach by Leo Lucassen, Wim Willems, Anne-Marie Cottaar, the Centre for the History of Migrants, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 1998 Macmillan Press Ltd, Similar to Indigenous Norwegian Travellers, Dutch Travellers are theorised to have Yenish Traveller (German Traveller) admixture and possibly could be descended from them. Settled people call Dutch Travellers Woonwagenbewoners (Caravan Dwellers) but they call themselves Reizigers (Travellers). They refer to settled people as Burgers (Citizens). The name Kampers (Campers) is considered discriminatory by Dutch Travellers.  Indigenous Norwegian Travellers (Sk√∏yere/Fantefolk)  Indigenous Norwegian Travellers (More commonly known as Fanter, Fantefolk or Sk√∏yere) are an itinerant group who call themselves Reisende. Confusingly, this term is also used by Romanis√¶l Travellers (Tater people), the Romani group of Norway and Sweden. Unlike the Romanis√¶l Travellers, the indigenous Norwegian Travellers are non-Romani by culture and origins, and they do not speak any form of Romani language. Instead, their language is ‚ÄòRodi‚Äô which is a Norwegian dialect. Similar to Indigenous Dutch Travellers, Indigenous Norwegian Travellers are theorised to have Yenish Traveller (German Traveller) admixture and possibly could be descended from them. Norwegian Rodi includes a large proportion of Yenish loanwords. Rodi also has a handful of Scandoromani loanwords due to Romanis√¶l Travellers and Indigenous Norwegian Travellers both living in close proximity to each other. Indigenous Norwegian Travellers have always concentrated around Southern and Southwestern Norway along the coastline (which was separated from the rest of Norway due to mountains) and Romanis√¶l Travellers have always concentrated around Central Norway (specifically in Tr√∏ndelag county around the city of Trondheim). Historically, both groups have travelled all over, and often overlap into each other‚Äôs traditional areas. They are known to the settled majority population as fant/fanter, but they prefer the term reisende('travellers'). This term is also used by Romanis√¶l Travellers (the largest population of Romani people in Norway and Sweden), though the two groups are distinct. Eilert Sundt, a 19th-century sociologist, termed the indigenous Travellers sm√•vandrer or sm√•vandringer('small travellers‚Äô), to contrast them with the Romanis√¶l (Tater) Travellers, which Sundt called storvandrer or storvandringer (‚Äògreat travellers‚Äô) who ranged further in their journeys. Irish Travellers (Pavee) By blood, the Pavees are Irish, but have a separate language and culture than the settled Irish.Ethnicity and the American cemetery by Richard E. Meyer. 1993. \\"... though many of them crossed the Atlantic in centuries past to play their trade\\". They live predominantly in Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States.Questioning Gypsy identity: ethnic narratives in Britain and America by Brian Belton Travellers refer to themselves as Minc√©ir√≠ or Pavees in their own language or in Irish as an Lucht Si√∫il, meaning literally \\"the walking people\\". The term Pikey is a pejorative slang term used mainly in the United Kingdom to refer to Irish Travellers. The language of the Irish Travellers, Shelta, is mainly based on an Irish lexicon and an English grammar. There are two dialects of this language: Gammon (or Gamin) and Cant. It has been dated back to the eighteenth century but may be older.Sharon Gmlech, op. cit., p. 234 The vast majority of Irish Travellers are Roman Catholics who maintain their traditions and culture in a close knit community of families. In 1963 a commission was put in place looking into ‚Äúitinerants‚Äù in which recommended to take their children and place them into industrial schools in hopes to cleanse Irish society. Rilantu Minc√©ir (Irish Traveller) survivor Mary Teresa Collins had said she was ‚Äúsnatched from the side of the road\\". In 2011 an analysis of DNA from 40 Travellers showed that Irish Travellers are a distinct Indigenous Irish ethnic minority who separated from the settled Irish community at least 1000 years ago; the claim was made that they are as distinct from the settled community as Icelanders are from Norwegians. Like other itinerant groups they have often been racially discriminated against in the past and still are today. They were only recognised as an official ethnic group in the Republic of Ireland on March 1, 2017.  Northern Romani Travellers  Northern Romani Traveller groups include: 1.) Romanichal Travellers in England (As well as North East Wales, South Wales and the Scottish Borders), with diaspora communities in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. 2.) Welsh Kale Travellers in the West-speaking parts of Northwestern Wales. 3.) Scottish Lowland Travellers in Lowland Scotland. 4.) Romanis√¶l Travellers in Central Norway and Sweden. 5.) Finnish Kale in Finland and parts of Sweden. These groups have much European blood due to mixing with Indigenous Traveller groups (British Romani Travellers mix with Irish Travellers, Scottish Highland Travellers and Funfair Traveller and Scandinavian Romani Travellers mix with Indigenous Norwegian Travellers) and even non-Travellers over the centuries. This has led to these Romani groups generally looking White in appearance. It is also a reason why these groups speak mixed languages rather than more pure forms of Romani: Romanichal Travellers speak Angloromani (A mix of English and Romani). Romanis√¶l Travellers speak Scandoromani (A mix of Norwegian, Swedish and Romani). Scottish Lowland Travellers speak Scottish Cant (A mix of Scots and Romani). Welsh Kale speak Kal√° (A mix of Welsh, English and Romani). Finnish Kale speak Kalo (A mix of Finnish and Romani). Northern European Romani groups culturally have more in common with Indigenous Northern European Traveller groups, such as Irish Travellers, Dutch Travellers, Scottish Highland Travellers and Norwegian Travellers then what they do with Romani from the rest of Europe. Northern Romani groups have common ancestry from the wave of Romani who migrated to England and Scotland in the 16th century. These groups also tend to identity as ‚ÄúTravellers‚Äù more than they do as ‚ÄúGypsies‚Äù. Northern Romani diverged so much from Romani from the rest of Europe due to mixing with local Traveller groups and staying isolated from the rest of Europe for centuries. Romani from the rest of Europe consider Northern Romani groups to not be proper Romani, due to their languages, heritage and cultures being mixed. Many Romani from the rest of Europe wrongfully assume that Northern Romani groups don‚Äôt have Romani roots and that they are Indigenous European Travellers, similar to Irish Travellers for example.  Romani/Gypsies  Sinti Romanies in the Rhineland, 1935. The best known itinerant community are the Romani people (also Romany, Romanies Tzigani, Rromani, and variants). The Romani have Indo-Aryan roots and heritage and first entered Europe via the Middle East around a thousand years ago. They spread further through Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries, separating into various subgroups in the process. They speak Romani, and Indo-Aryan language.  Indigenous Scottish Highland Travellers Scottish Highland Travellers are also known as Ceardannan in Scottish Gaelic (which means \\"the craftsmen\\" or 'Black Tinkers') or more poetically as the \\"Summer Walkers\\". The Highland Traveller community has a long history in Scotland going back on record to at least the 12th century. Historically they would travel from village to village and would pitch their bow-tents on rough ground around the edge of a village and would earn money there as tinsmiths, hawkers, horse dealers or pearl-fishermen. Many found seasonal employment on farms, e.g. doing berry picking or during harvests. Nowadays the majority of Highland Travellers have settled down into organized campsites or regular houses. The Scottish Highland Travellers have their own (nearly extinct) language based on Scottish Gaelic called Beurla Reagaird. Highland Travellers are closely tied to their native Highlands the native Gaelic speaking population; they may follow an itinerant or a settled lifestyle. They have played an essential role in the preservation of traditional Gaelic culture.Travelling People ‚Äî Highland Travellers. Travellers' outstanding contribution to Highland life has been as custodians of an ancient and vital Gaelic singing, storytelling and folklore tradition of great importance. It is estimated that there are only 2,000 Highland Travellers leading their traditional lifestyle.  Yenish Travellers  Two Jenische in Muotathal, Switzerland, ca. 1890 In German-speaking Europe, France and Wallonia, there are the Jenische or Yeniche (in German and French spelling, respectively). An early description of this group was published by Johann Ulrich Sch√∂ll in 1793.  Funfair Travellers (Showmen)  Showman, also known as Funfair Travellers or Travelling Showpeople, are the members of families who own travelling funfairs and circuses, and are referred to as occupational travelers, who move around as part of their work. These groups formed across Europe, and included the families of travelling funfairs and circuses that required frequent mobility. These groups usually follow a set pattern of yearly nomadism. Membership of these groups has, over the years, been drawn from other communities. For example, Showmen in Great Britain and Ireland often had a mix of English, Scottish, Welsh, Irish, and/or Traveller (typically Romanichal Traveller and Irish Traveller) heritage. As a result, Funfair Travellers are not defined as an ethnic group, even though they display certain common features, although in many countries (such as the UK) they identify as a cultural group. Funfair Travellers often sport unique cultures and self-identity, and they tend to be insular, favouring marriage within the communityDallas, Duncan, (1971) The Travelling People, , which results in long lineages and a strong sense of cultural homogeneity. For example, the Showman's Guild of Great Britain requires that applicants have a parent from the Funfair Travelling community.National Fairground Archive . Many Funfair Travellers in the fairground and circus business across Europe have partial Romani heritage, evidenced by significant traces of the Romani language and matriarchal forms of social organisation. Despite this, the roots, culture, traditions, and identity of showman groups have remained separate from Romani groups.

He received a George Polk Award for \\"Science Reporting\\" in 1948. Background Albert Deutsch was born on October 23, 1905, on the lower East Side of New York City to immigrant parents from Latvia. He attended public schools but dropped out of high school. Career After dropping out, he traveled for a number of years throughout the United States and supported himself by working as a longshoreman, a farm worker, and a shipyard worker. He continued to educate himself in biography and history by visiting public libraries. He returned to New York City in the early 1930s. In 1934, he secured a position as an archivist-researcher with the New York State Department of Public Welfare, which was writing a history of the welfare period from 1867 to 1940. The book was published in 1942. While researching for this book, he found material about the public care of the mentally ill and he approached the National Foundation for Mental Health (part of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene) with a proposal to prepare a history of psychiatry in the United States. He proposed to co-author the book with Clifford Beers, Secretary of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene and the author of the acclaimed book The Mind that Found Itself, published in 1909. In the end, the book The Mentally Ill in America: A History of Their Care and Treatment from Colonial Times was published in 1937 with Deutsch the author. Deutsch had a successful career as a social historian and as a journalist. From 1941 to 1947, he was a columnist for the New York Post, writing on social aspects of health care. In 1948, he contributed to the short-lived New York Star (1948-1949). Later, he published several books based on his columns. In 1945, he wrote about the care of veterans in the Veterans Administration hospitals. In 1948, his book The Shame of the States exposed the conditions in state mental hospitals. In 1950, he wrote Our Rejected Children, and in 1955, The Trouble with Cops. In 1945, he received the Heywood Broun award for his newspaper work. In 1947, the Newspaper Guild honored him as a distinguished humanitarian in American journalism. In 1948, he was elected to the Innominate Society. In 1949, he received the Albert Lasker Award presented by the National Committee against Mental Illness. The American Psychiatric Association bestowed upon him an honorary membership in 1958. In 1956, he received a grant from the National Association for Mental Health; later supplemented by funds from the National Institute of Mental Health to prepare a survey of mental health research in the United States. Death Deutsch died June 18, 1961 in England while attending a conference hosted by the World Federation for Mental Health.

Prior thereto she was an assistant professor in the same department at the same university from 1981 to 1983. From 1984 to 1994, also at Baylor College of Medicine, she also held a position as associate professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology. She is currently an honorary lecturer at the University of Nairobi. She is a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Endocrine Society, the American Society for Cell Biology, and the New York Academy of Sciences. She is currently the owner of the Karen Blixen Coffee Garden Restaurant and Cottages, as well as the treasurer of the African Biomedical Center. She also served on the editorial board of the journal Medical Veritas, which was published from 2004 to 2008 and endorsed anti- vaccine views. Education Dunbar was born in Sterling, Colorado. She received her bachelors' (1970) and masters' (1971) degrees from the University of Colorado Boulder, followed by a PhD in zoology from the University of Tennessee in 1977. She did postdoctoral research from 1975 to 1978 at the University of California Davis. Scientific career After completing her postdoc, Dunbar worked at the Population Council of Rockefeller University until 1981, when she became an assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine's department of cell biology. Her research into the zona pellucida as a graduate student led her to the search for a contraceptive when she noticed that some infertile women had antibodies to their own zona pellucida, preventing the sperm from entering the egg when sex took place. To this end, she proposed the injection of pig proteins into rabbits to induce autoimmunity, a proposal which proved successful; however, it was not without serious side effects: the rabbits thus immunized developed an autoimmune disease which resulted in their immune system attacking their ovaries, causing permanent ovarian failure. She has also said that her interest in this arose because \\"...in my young years I had a vision that maybe we could help the world population problem and provide women with an option for birth control that was not invasive in our hormones or our systems or otherwise have the side effects we now see with a lot of contraceptive methods.\\" In February 1991, Dr. Dunbar received a patent on such a vaccine while affiliated with Zonagen. In 1994, Dunbar filed a lawsuit accusing Baylor College of Medicine, the Houston-based law firm Fulbright & Jaworski, Zonagen, and a group of investors of forcing her to relinquish patent rights to this vaccine. In 1999, the parties reached a settlement; the terms were not disclosed, but Dunbar said she was \\"very happy\\" with it. In June 2001, Dunbar lost everything she had been storing in her lab‚Äî\\"20 years of research\\" according to the Houston Chronicle‚Äîafter Tropical Storm Allison devastated Baylor College of Medicine. Views on the Hepatitis B vaccine Dunbar has vocally criticized the hepatitis B vaccine, which, she claims, may be more dangerous than Hepatitis B itself for a small portion of the Caucasian population. She began suspecting the vaccine was dangerous after her brother, Bohn, developed rashes on his face, fatigue, and a number of other symptoms after being vaccinated with it. In 2000, Dunbar said that her brother \\"hasn't been out of bed since\\" he received the Hepatitis B vaccine. Her beliefs surrounding the potential dangers of these vaccines are well-summed up in this quote: \\"The only thing that happened [to medical workers who developed multiple sclerosis] is they took this vaccine, and within a month most of these people have had completely debilitating lifestyle changes.\\" References Category:American molecular biologists Category:Baylor College of Medicine faculty Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Vaccinologists Category:University of Colorado Boulder alumni Category:University of Tennessee alumni Category:People from Sterling, Colorado Category:21st-century American zoologists Category:Women medical researchers Category:American women biologists Category:University of California, Davis alumni ","title":"Bonnie S.

He is a professor of vertebrate palaeontology, Deputy Director of the Academic Committee, and Deputy Director of Key Laboratory of Evolutionary Systematics of Vertebrates at IVPP. Education Deng was born in Yibin, Sichuan, China. He studied at Peking University from where he obtained BS in 1984. He completed MS from Southwest Petroleum University in 1994. He obtained PhD from the Northwest University in 1997. Professional career Deng works at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology as a researcher and PhD supervisor. His specialization is in the study of mammalian fossils, biostratigraphy, and environmental changes during the Late Cenozoic. Deng currently assumes several positions, including Deputy Director for the Academic Committee of IVPP, and professor of palaeontology at the graduate school of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He is also the Deputy Editor-in- Chief of two technical journals, Vertebrata PalAsiatica and Evolution of Life. Research achievements Deng has published more than 120 technical papers on palaeontology. He and his team had first major breakthrough in the Zanda Basin, from where they discovered fossil materials of Tibetan wooly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) on 22 August 2007. After painstaking excavation, they unearthed the skull, jaw bone and cervical vertebra of the adult wooly rhinoceros. An analysis through animal group comparison and paleomagnetic test indicated the fossil's geological age to be about 3.7 million years old and in the middle of the Pliocene. Their research eventually lead to indept knowledge of the dramatic rising of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and its great impact to evolution of mammals with respect to climate changes. His team reported in 2011 that the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is actually the place of origin of the woolly rhinos during the Pliocene Ice Age, from where they evolved and spread out into other Asian and European regions. In 2012 he and his team reported the discovery of a 4.6 million-year-old three-toed horse Hipparion zandaense from Tibet. In 2013 they discovered Sinotherium lagrelii from Linxia Basin, a transitional fossil in the lineage of one-horned rhinoceros, tha basis of the unicorn legend in the region; and a new hornless rhino Aceratherium porpani from Thailand. =Discrediting forged fossil= Deng was on the news headline around the world for revealing a fossil forgery, Acinonyx kurteni or the Lynxia cheetah. The cheetah was reported in 2009, and was claimed to be the oldest true cheetah species ever discovered. Deng was the first to note the unusual fossil description while proofreading the manuscript for publication of the discovery in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA. He immediately reported to PNAS that parts of the skull had been concocted from plaster, and that pieces of bones looked like being glued together to create a unique skull. However, his objection to publication was rejected as he had no direct examination of the fossil. After years of arguments in the scientific community, it was only in 2012 that Deng was allowed access to the original fossil upon invoking the PNAS data access policy, and on examination, his primary suspicions were proven correct, that the fossil was a deliberate fake. On 20 August 2012 one of the authors, Ji H. Maz√°k finally made a retraction in PNAS. Awards and honours Deng was awarded with the Chinese national prize for outstanding dissertation in 2000.

It was based on one of the most popular and best-loved characters of Indian folklore. It was produced by Toonz Animation Studios. Promoted with the tagline \\"Get Ready for the Rama Effect\\", the series aired every Saturday and Sunday on Cartoon Network in India. The Adventures of Tenali Rama is the first Indian animated television series. It was available in English and Hindi languages on Cartoon Network. Shortly after that, it was made available in Tamil (Original dub for Cartoon Network). It was redubbed once again in Tamil when it was aired on Chutti TV and was also dubbed in Kannada for Chintu TV respectively. Tenali Rama is a part of the Cartoon Network's localisation strategy for India. It was the fourth Indian produced animated series acquired by the network. Talking about the reasons for acquiring such India-centric animated series, Ian Diamond, senior vice- president and general manager, Turner Entertainment Networks Asia, said, \\"Providing content based on the Indian story-telling heritage is a critical mandate for Cartoon Network in its mission to contextualise the Network for our Indian audiences.\\" Roger Dondis, the creative director of the Tenali Raman series, recalled: \\"When I landed at the Toonz Animation Studios in 2001 they had the basic idea and several drawings. The folk tales of Tenali Raman were very short and many of them were not appropriate for modern cartoons so the scriptwriter Arial Prendergast had to take the basic idea and stretch it out. And we had to constantly hold meetings with our Indian colleagues to get the nuances just right.\\" Dan McHale, the animation director of the series, came to train the artists to do the in-betweens and clean up. He also did the voiceover of the character Raj Guru and the theme song for the series. He said, \\"Though I have done voices before this is the first time I have done the music.\\" P. Jayakumar, Director of Operations, Toonz Animation, said, \\"To produce a half-hour animation episode in any of the studios in the United States costs around $300,000 and in an [sic] Hollywood Studio it costs around $500,000. While in India it only costs $60,000 to $70,000. The only problem is the quality of animation produced in India is not of international standards even now and many studios fail to make on time delivery. To overcome this problem, Toonz Animation ensures at least 10 percent of their staff has international exposure. These expatriates then train their Indian counterparts. Toonz has been able to curb costs by doing everything here in India, and the 26 episode series of Tenali Raman just cost $50,000 for two 11-minute episodes.\\" The series was also shown in France (at Cannes) where it was appreciated. A comic book edition of Tenali Raman was published by Penguin Books India.

The company was acquired by Georgia-Pacific Corporation in 1990. Its name was revived in 2011 when private equity firm Cate Street Capital acquired Great Northern's original Maine mills. History =Maine= Map of Great Northern Paper Company's timberland holdings in 1950. Great Northern Paper Company log pile in Millinocket (1908). The company got its start when the Maine legislature authorized Charles W. Mullen to form a water power company on the West Branch Penobscot River. Mullen had observed the drop of the West Branch Penobscot River at Grand Falls in 1891 while surveying a route for the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad. He later worked with Garret Schenck, part owner of the Rumford Falls Paper Company, to build a paper mill in Millinocket, Penobscot County, Maine on the river. Schenck formed the Northern Development Company in 1897. The Millinocket plant produced its first roll of newsprint on 9 November 1900. A second mill in Madison opened in 1906. A third one opened in East Millinocket in 1907, which also had its own dam and hydroelectric facility. Financiers of the corporation included Oliver Payne and William Collins Whitney. When the Millinocket Mill opened it was the world's largest paper mill, producing 240 tons/day of newsprint, 120 tons/day of sulfite pulp, and 240 tons/day of groundwood pulp. It was the first paper mill to have an electrical generation and distribution facility built into the plant. The company's innovations included a pulpwood grinding machine still known throughout the paper industry as Great Northern grinders. In the 1910s Great Northern built the Ripogenus Dam and power plant on the West Branch of the Penobscot River. Construction of a thermal power plant in 1958 raised the total generating capacity of the Millinocket mill complex to . High-pressure steam generated by burning waste bark was routed first through generator turbines, and the low-pressure exhaust steam was then used to dry the paper. Mid-20th-century paper production of 1,000 tonnes per day was sold to 250 newspapers east of the Mississippi River. In 1930 the company sold around Maine's highest point, Mount Katahdin, for $25,000 to former Maine Governor Percival Proctor Baxter. In turn Baxter donated the land to the state, for what became the present-day Baxter State Park. In the 1940s its timber holdings increased to more than 2 million acres and its work force was supplemented during World War II by a prisoner of war camp at Seboomook Farm near Moosehead Lake. =20th century mergers and acquisitions= In 1962, the Great Northern Paper Company expanded to Jakin, Georgia, where it formed a subsidiary named the Great Southern Land and Paper Company. It produced linerboard and corrugating medium. In 1970, the Great Northern Paper Company merged with the Nekoosa-Edwards Paper Company in Port Edwards, Wisconsin, and was renamed the Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation. New mills were built in Arkansas and Mississippi. In 1971, the company completed construction of the 97-mile Golden Road in Maine that paralleled the West Branch of the Penobscot River from Quebec to its mill at Millinocket. It ended the practice of floating logs down the river via log driving, and instead shipped them by truck. In 1989, Georgia-Pacific launched a hostile takeover of the company which closed in 1990 for $3.8 billion.https://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/28/business/company-news-georgia- pacific-in-asset-sale.html Georgia-Pacific in turn sold the Maine holdings to Bowater in 1991. In 1999, Inexcon, a Canadian company, acquired the Maine holdings. 21st century The Inexcon holdings in Maine went into bankruptcy in 2002. They were acquired by Brascan Corporation in April 2003 and operated under the name of Katahdin Paper Company LLC. In 2003 Brookfield Asset Management bought the mills after the company filed for bankruptcy. That company continued its decline, laying off workers in 2008. In 2011 the Kahahdin Paper Company LLC holdings in Maine were acquired by Cate Street Capital of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. They revived the Great Northern Paper name. The mill at East Millinocket was launched again although with diminished output. The purchase by Cate Street was seen as a positive alternative to the closing of the mill at a time when the region was experiencing 22% unemployment. The Millinocket mill was never reopened, but for a while it seemed that the East Millinocket mill could improve its financial status. Within the year of the Cate Street purchase and the reopening of the East Millinocket mill over 250 people had been hired. Just one year later the mill was called upon to supply the paper needed to produce the popular trilogy Fifty Shades of Grey. The mill's output that year was 3,000 tons of paper, mostly for the three-part novel, which was printed on Great Northern's Baxter Brite paper. In 2013 Cate Street Capital announced plans to tear down virtually all the mill buildings at the Millinocket plant, and replace them with structures to operate a Torrefaction wood operation, under the name of its subsidiary Thermogen Industries. In 2014 the over-100-year-old paper mill was forced to close down its operations. Originally the company and workers were hopeful that the closure would be temporary. However, when the company sent out notices under the WARN Act (Workers Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act) to its workers in August, 2014, the closure could only be understood as permanent. At the time of the bankruptcy Great Northern listed over 1,000 creditors in its filing. An investigation done by the Maine Sunday Telegram uncovered that a majority of the $40 million investment in the Great Northern Paper mill was \\"returned the same day to investors.\\" The investors are receiving $16 million from Maine's General Fund over seven years. The research showed that neither the $31.8 million loan nor the $8.2 million equity investment was used to pay for improvements to the mill. On January 12, 2017, Our Katahdin, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization based in the Katahdin region, purchased all remaining former Great Northern Paper Company assets in Millinocket through the sale of two subsidiaries of Cate Street Capital, GNP West and GNP Holding II.

It was located near a spring known in pre-Christian times and later Christianized as St Lawrence's spring. It was well known for the powerful effects of its waters. The church itself was also originally dedicated to St Lawrence. Today's stone building dates from the end of the 14th century. Apart from a short period in the 16th century, it was annexed to Halsted Church. Together with Halsted, in 1719 it was transferred to the Juellinge barony, created in honor of Jens Juel, and was subsequently owned by members of the Juel-Vind family. The church gained its independence in 1957. Architecture The church was built in the Gothic style with a nave and a chancel with a three-sided east wall. The tower was added slightly later.

On 14 February 1581 Mark Kerr met the English diplomat Thomas Randolph in Edinburgh and asked for a safe- conduct, a travel document, for Lord Seton to go the English court. Randolph refused, as Seton's politics had not previously favoured England, and Kerr took his answer to the king.

He was a papal master of ceremonies from 1998 to 2013. In 2013 he was appointed as the papal almoner. Pope Francis created him a cardinal on 28 June 2018. Life Krajewski was born in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland. In 1982 he entered the seminary of the Archdiocese of ≈Å√≥d≈∫. He earned a degree in theology from the Catholic University of Lublin and was ordained a priest on 11 June 1988. After ordination, he served the diocese for two years in pastoral work. In 1990 Krajewski continued his studies at the Liturgical Institute of St. Anselmo in Rome. On 5 March 1993 he obtained his Licentiate in Sacred Liturgy. Krajewski earned a Doctorate in Theology from the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas in 1995 with a dissertation entitled L'ordinazione episcopale nella riforma del Concilio Vaticano II (\\"Episcopal ordination in the reform of Vatican II\\"). During his stay in Rome Krajewski collaborated with the Office for the Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff. He returned to his diocese in 1995 and served as master of ceremonies for the archbishop and taught liturgy at the seminary and to the Franciscans and Salesians. In 1998 he returned to Rome to work in the Office of Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff. On 12 May 1999, Pope John Paul II appointed him a Papal Master of Ceremonies. On 3 August 2013, Pope Francis appointed him Papal Almoner, the formal title of which office is \\"Almoner of His Holiness.\\" At the same time, he was made Titular Archbishop of Beneventum. He was consecrated on 17 September 2013 by Cardinal Giuseppe Bertello with Archbishops Piero Marini and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Zi√≥≈Çek as co-consecrators. Pope Francis attended the consecration. On the Pope's behalf, the almoner carries out acts of charity and raises the money to fund them. Krajewski's office funds its work by selling customized parchments with a photograph of the pope and an inscription in calligraphy that document papal blessings granted on a special occasion, such as a wedding, baptism or priestly ordination. All proceeds go directly to the works of charity. In 2012, the office spent one million Euro (US$1.4 million) on 6,500 requests for help. Krajewski described how Francis has redefined the little-known office of papal almoner: \\"The Holy Father told me at the beginning: 'You can sell your desk. You don't need it. You need to get out of the Vatican. Don't wait for people to come ringing. You need to go out and look for the poor'\\", Krajewski said. Requests for aid that the pope receives are delivered to the almoner daily, sometimes accompanied with notations in the pope's hand. Archbishop Krajewski has visited homes for the elderly and distributed funds to the needy. He spent four days on the island of Lampedusa after a migrant boat carrying Eritreans capsized, praying with police divers as they worked to raise the dead from the sea floor. In June 2015 Archbishop Krajewski announced plans for a thirty-bed, volunteer-run dormitory for the homeless near the Vatican. Krajewski said the entire initiative was aimed at \\"giving people their dignity.\\" It opened in October 2015. Santa Maria Immacolata all'Esquilino Pope Francis made him a cardinal on 28 June 2018, assigning him the titular church of . On May 11 2019, Krajewski climbed down a manhole cover in a Rome street to break a seal and switch back on the electricity supply to a building where 450 people were squatting, including 100 children, thereby restoring power and hot water which they had been without for five days. The squatters included migrants. Krajewski was criticised on Twitter by Matteo Salvini, the Deputy Prime Minister of Italy, for his action but responded by telling the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera: \\"From now on.... I'll pay the bills; indeed I will even pay his\\" [Salvini's bill]. (His remark in Italian is in the paragraph beneath a photo showing Krajewski circled in red) Krajewski received significant positive attention in early May 2020 when he wired charity money for food to a group of transgender sex workers who had been left out of a job due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Krajewski expressed surprise at the attention given to this action, as he defined it within the normal charitable works of the Catholic Church.

They have more variety than emoticons and have a basis from internet \\"reaction face\\" culture due to their ability to portray body language with a facial reaction. Stickers are elaborate, character-driven emoticons and give people a lightweight means to communicate through kooky animations. History Stickers were first popularized by the Korean-developed mobile messaging app Line. Naver developed the app with the Japanese market in mind, as KakaoTalk was already the dominant mobile messaging service in South Korea. The stickers' blend of the ubiquitous emoji system with anime-styled artwork, and their use as a substitute for typing out longer messages in Japanese text, helped the feature appeal to Japanese audiences. As Line's dominance grew, the mascot characters featured within Line's sticker sets also became popular as merchandise. In 2013, stickers began to expand beyond Asian markets: Path added stickers in March 2013 as part of its new private messaging system, followed by Facebook's main and Facebook Messenger mobile apps in April. In July, sticker functionality was extended to Facebook's web interface, while Kik Messenger also added stickers. Startup companies devoted to stickers also emerged, helping produce them on behalf of brands as part of advertising campaigns. By November 2013, a survey of mobile messaging users found that 40% of those surveyed used stickers on a daily basis, with Indonesians showing the highest amount of daily usage (46%), followed by China (43%), South Korea (38%) and the United States (35%). Out of those who did regularly use stickers, 20% had had paid for stickers or emoji in mobile messaging apps at least once. In 2016, Snapchat acquired Bitstrips for its app Bitmoji, which allows users to create custom stickers featuring a personal avatar. Use and model Stickers are commonly downloadable for free, but some services may offer premium options via microtransactions. Sets may be devoted to specific themes, characters, as well as popular brands and media franchises such as Hello Kitty, Psy, and the Minions of Despicable Me.

The work features a Western hemlock that fell outside of Seattle in 1996, acting as a nurse log within an greenhouse. According to the Seattle Art Museum, which operates the park, the tree \\"inhabits an art system\\" consisting of bacteria, fungi, insects, lichen and plants. The installation supplies magnifying glasses to visitors wanting a closer inspection; they are provided field guides in the form of tiles. The installation was donated by Bill and Sally Neukom, American Express Company, Seattle Garden Club, Mark Torrance Foundation and Committee of 33, in honor of the Seattle Art Museum's 75th anniversary. It was Dion's first permanent public work of art in the United States. The architect for the structure was Owen Richards Architects. Description Neukom Vivarium is a mixed media installation by American artist Mark Dion, located at Olympic Sculpture Park in Seattle, Washington. The work's design was approved in 2004 and completed in 2006. The Seattle Art Museum, which operates the park, described Neukom Vivarium as a \\"hybrid work of sculpture, architecture, environmental education and horticulture that connects art and science.\\" It features a nurse log, formerly part of a forest ecosystem that now \\"inhabits an art system\\", housed within an greenhouse. The greenhouse includes a cabinet designed by Dion that supplies magnifying glasses, allowing visitors to inspect the log for various life forms. Field guides are present in the form of blue and white tiles, depicting bacteria, fungi, insects, lichen and plants that may be found on the log. Visitors viewing the installation in 2007, as seen from outside the greenhouse Dion had hoped to feature one of two tree species for the installation‚ÄîDouglas fir or Western hemlock‚Äîthe former for its \\"mythic presence\\" and the latter for its charisma, and for being the state tree of Washington. The hemlock used for Neukom Vivarium fell outside of Seattle on February 8, 1996, in a protected drainage basin with old-growth forest. As a result of this incident, the biodegradation process was decelerated. According to Dion, the tree \\"had just fallen into [their] lap\\" and was suitable for its accessibility, personality and size. He said of the exhibit: Neukom Vivarium was a gift from Bill and Sally Neukom, American Express Company, Seattle Garden Club, Mark Torrance Foundation and Committee of 33, in honor of the Seattle Art Museum's 75th anniversary.

He is one of the early creators of the Serbian critical historiographical school and fighters for the separation of historical science from tradition. Kovaƒçeviƒá directly influenced the political and cultural activity of Serbia at the end of the nineteenth century. He and Ljubomir Jovanoviƒá were the authors of the well-known two-volume \\"Istorija srpskog naroda za srednje ≈°kole\\" (History of the Serbian People for the Secondary Schools) in the Kingdom of Serbia. Both Kovaƒçeviƒá and Jovanoviƒá were Ministers of Education at one time and, as historians, using a wealth of verified information, professionally and convincingly refuted many myths that were passed down through the ages. Biography Kovaƒçeviƒá was born in the village of Petnica in the Principality of Serbia on 4 January 1848. His father was Mihailo Kovaƒçeviƒá, the Serbian Orthodox parish priest of Petnica, and his mother Vasilija was the daughter of professor Janiƒáije Popoviƒá. Kovaƒçeviƒá was educated at the Gymnasium of ≈†abac and the Belgrade Great School, Grandes √©coles; he took his degree in 1870, afterward was employed as lecturer at a college in Negotin and a year later he joined the staff of a teacher's college in Kragujevac before it was relocated to Belgrade. Later, he became a professor of history at his alma mater and rector of the University of Belgrade (former Great School). Kovaƒçeviƒá chose to specialize in history because of his desire to be involved in the developing field of critical historiography. Kovaƒçeviƒá had five daughters and a son, Vladeta Kovaƒçeviƒá (1882‚Äì1912), a former student of the University of Paris. At the Battle of Kumanovo, where he commanded the Mitrailleuses (machineguns), Vladeta was killed. His body was brought back to Belgrade. On the day of the funeral, his mother and five sisters wept and groaned aloud. At the grave the old father without a tear made a moving speech: {{quoteMy son, depart in peace. You have done your duty. My son, I do not weep: I am proud of you. You have joined the heroes whose sufferings and death of old saved by millions the lives and souls of our nation. Tell the heroes of Kosovo, Du≈°an and Lazar and all the martyrs of former days, that today Kosovo is avenged.https://www.nacionalnarevija.com/en/tekstovi/br10/Sloboda%20-%20Reci%20im,%20sine%20moj.html Kovaƒçeviƒá fought in the Serbian‚ÄìOttoman War (1876‚Äì78). He died at Vrnjaƒçka Banja on 19 November 1918.https://www.nacionalnarevija.com/en/tekstovi/br10/Sloboda%20-%20Reci%20im,%20sine%20moj.html Works In 1888 Ljubomir Kovaƒçeviƒá wrote a treatise on \\"Vuk Brankoviƒá, 1372‚Äì1398\\" while Ilarion Ruvarac, coincidence would have it, wrote a treatise on \\"Prince Lazar\\" at the same time. Both of them, through a scholarly analysis of the sources and by applying existing principles of historiographic critique, omitted anything that was not verifiable by well-informed sources close to the event under study. In this manner, the story of the Battle of Kosovo was stripped of many picturesque details, the most important among them being the betrayal of Vuk Brankoviƒá (ƒÜirkoviƒá 1990: 115‚Äì116). These two scholars, independently of one another, came to the conclusion that Vuk Brankoviƒá had not been a traitor in Kosovo, after all. A polemic soon arose between Panta Sreƒákoviƒá and Russian Slavist Vladimir Vasiljeviƒá Kaƒçanovski (1853‚Äì1901) who defended the thesis that historical truths should have other tasks besides purely scientific ones. In the end, Kovaƒçeviƒá and Ruvarac succeeded to tear down the ruling school of Panta Sreƒákoviƒá and Vladimir Kaƒçanovski with the aid of Konstantin Jireƒçek who also proved that Vuk Brankoviƒá was not a traitor, and that Uro≈° died three months after King Vuka≈°in, in December 1371, all thanks to the archives of Dubrovnik. These were but a few of the many myths that were put to rest, finally.

Biography He was born in Belgrade in February 1867, and was educated at the grammar school there. He graduated from law school at Belgrade's Grande √©cole (Velika ≈†kola), and was called to the bar in 1891. Mitroviƒá was appointed to the courthouse in U≈æice. He also served in the same capacity in ƒåaƒçak, Mionica, Smederevo and Knja≈æevac, and became a judge in 1897. He was relieved of his duties the following year, for political reasons. Under the new administration in 1900 he accepted the appointment of judge in ≈†abac, and later was named secretary of the Appeal Court in Belgrade. In the discharge of his important duties he greatly endeared himself to the Serbian people. The spirit in which he acted and the aims which he steadily set before himself contributed to the allaying of party animosities, to the promotion of a willing submission to the laws, to the property of trade and to the extension and improvement of education. Concerning the great issues of the day, his views were opposed to those of the government. This led to his recall by the government in 1903, a step which proved deeply unpopular. He pleaded for justice, and that same year he was reinstated as secretary of the Appeal Court. He was secretary of the Appeal Court when he died on 15 May 1907, a victim of tuberculosis. Works He came to write poetry under the influence of his friend, Vojislav Iliƒá. In flowing verse, without many personal references, he used motifs from medieval Western Europe, described his own experiences, his rebellion against the government of oppression, his horror of the social system that existed at the time, etc. Mitrovic is best known for \\"Knjige o ljubavi\\" (Book About Love, 1899) and his political satire, \\"Prigodne pesme\\" (Commemorative Songs, 1903). He left several unfinished epic poems, including \\"Penelopa\\". After the death of Vojislav Iliƒá, for a time the most outstanding Serbian lyrist was Milorad Mitroviƒá. Considered one of the finest and most promising poets of his generation before he too died an untimely death, like the great poet, Vojislav Iliƒá, both victims of consumption. Iliƒá's influence was not limited only to Mitroviƒá but encompassed young poets who started writing during the 1890s. Among these poets were Jovan Duƒçiƒá, Mileta Jak≈°iƒá and Aleksa ≈†antiƒá. Many of Mitroviƒá's poems were transcribed into songs. A good illustration are such popular songs as: \\"Bila jednom ruza jedna\\" (There Once Was a Rose); \\"Svinja reformator\\" (Pig Reformer); \\"Don Ramiro\\"; \\"Papuƒçica\\" (Slippers); and \\"Sigurna Pesma\\" (Certain Song).

The Bear Mountains lie just north of the village of Magdalena and north of the Magdalena Mountains in New Mexico. The Bear Mountains are located within the Magdalena Ranger District of the Cibola National Forest. There are two Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRA) within the Bear Mountains: the Scott Mesa IRA (39,534 acres) and the Goat Spring IRA (5,757 acres). The Bureau of Land Management‚Äôs Sierra Ladrones Wilderness Study Area (45,308 acres) stretches to the northeast of the Bear Mountains and connects the Bear Mountains with the 230,000-acre Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge to the east. The world- renowned Very Large Array lies to the southwest of the Bear Mountains. Robert Julyan's The Place Names of New Mexico notes that \\"bear\\" names throughout New Mexico frequently come from a particular incident with a bear rather than a general abundance of bears because \\"any encounter with a bear likely would have been memorable.\\" Even so, the range is currently home to black bears, and grizzly bears were once found the area as well. History & Culture Basham noted in his report documenting the archeological history of the Cibola's Magdalena Ranger District that ‚Äú[t]he heritage resources on the district are diverse and representative of nearly every prominent human evolutionary event known to anthropology. Evidence for human use of district lands date back 14,000 years to the Paleoindian period providing glimpses into the peopling of the New World and megafaunal extinction.‚Äú Much of the now Magdalena Ranger District was a province of the Apache. Bands of Apache effectively controlled the Magdalena-Datil region from the seventeenth century until they were defeated in the Apache Wars in the late nineteenth century. Recreation Due to the absence of major light pollution, the Bear Mountains provide outstanding stargazing opportunities. The area also offers phenomenal hiking, backpacking, camping, hunting, and horseback-riding. As Robert Juylan points out in The Mountains of New Mexico, the range is rather popular among birdwatchers because of the various springs in the region. Ecology As with other mountain ranges in west-central New Mexico, the variations in elevation result in diverse vegetative types. Scrubland, pinyon-juniper woodland, Gambel oak, mountain mahogany and grassland areas are all represented.

Life The son of James Spens of Condie and Joanna Arnot, he was born about 1520, and educated at St Salvator's College, St Andrews, where he became a determinant in 1543. In 1549 he was, with eight other advocates, chosen by the Court of Session to plead before them in all cases. On 21 Oct. 1555 he was appointed joint Queen's Advocate to Mary Queen of Scots with David Lauder, after whose death in 1560 he was made a judge; but he continued to hold the post of queen's advocate, which he shared with Robert Crichton from 8 February 1560. When John Knox, on account of his letter about the mass, was in 1563 accused of treason, Spens came to him privately, and expressed the opinion that Knox had not been guilty of anything punishable by law. Knox stated that when Spens was commanded to accuse him before the queen, he did so, but \\"very gently\\". He adhered to the queen's party after her marriage to Henry Darnley; and he was officially entrusted with the prosecution of the murderers of David Rizzio. He also attended officially at the indictment of James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell for the murder of Darnley. In 1566 Spens was appointed one of a commission for the revision of the laws. He remained in office after the imprisonment of the queen, until his death in 1573.

The map also indicates the locations of Inventoried Roadless Areas. The Withington Wilderness is a 19,000-acre Wilderness area within the Magdalena Ranger District of the Cibola National Forest. The Withington sits within the northern section and on the eastern slope of the San Mateo Mountains in Socorro County, New Mexico, United States. The Withington Wilderness was designated by Congress in 1980. The Withington Wilderness ranges from 6,800 feet to 10,100 feet atop Mount Withington. Mount Withington was named by Ernest Allen Clemens after Albert Lee Withington, President of the Cleveland Society for Savings. Miss Ruth Withington, daughter of her late father Albert Withington, was present at the decoration day, May 31, 1909. Miss Withington became the wife of Ernest Clemens a prominent rancher whose ranch, the AL Ranch, was located near the base of the mountain. The 8,039-acre White Cap Inventoried Roadless Area is directly adjacent to the Withington Wilderness. The Apache Kid Wilderness, also in the San Mateo Mountains, lies due south of the Withington Wilderness. To the north of the Withington Wilderness and San Mateo Mountains is the Very Large Array radio telescope observatory. Plants & Wildlife The topography in the northern San Mateo Mountains is gentler than that in the south, but still features deep canyons, high ridgelines and generally dry conditions. Winters are cold enough to bring snow, and during July and August, the desert \\"monsoon\\" season, rainwater may flood narrow canyons. The vegetation ranges from pine, spruce, and fir at high elevations to pi√±on and juniper farther down. Near the eastern boundary, at the lowest elevation in the Wilderness, ocotillo stands are found. Habitats in the Withington Wilderness support populations of mountain lion, black bear, elk, mule deer, coyote, turkey and quail. A portion of the Wilderness is critical habitat for the threatened Mexican spotted owl. The greater San Mateo Mountains were identified as a key conservation area by The Nature Conservancy due to their ecological diversity and species richness. Recreation Quiet recreation opportunities including hiking, backbacking, stargazing, hunting, and horseback-riding are ample in the Withington Wilderness. The wild scenery is spectacular, with dramatic views from the top of ridgelines and open canyons available for exploration. Two developed campgrounds, Bear Trap and Hughes Mills, are located just outside the Wilderness and the latter provides hiking access to Mount Withington.

Though the earliest mentions of the festival we have date only from the fourth century BC, the festival was probably much older, Parke, p. 136, says that the festival \\"was probably a survival from the archaic past which had become fossilized\\", Parker (1996), p. 75 says \\"The panegyris or 'all-assembly' is in fact as ancient a Greek institution as any that we know of. If, as is likely, the system of tribal competition in Attic cults is archaic, there must always have been some pan- Attic festivals. Some old favourites (the Pandia for instance, the 'all-Zeus' festival or the Dipolieta) perhaps gradually faded away in the classical period\\", while Robertson sees the festival as marking the spring migration of sheep to mountain pastures, and having originated at least as early as the Mycenean period (Robertson 1991, p. 5; Robertson 1993, p. 15). Although little that is known of the Pandia is certain,Burkert, p. 182; Parke, pp. 135-136; Parker 2005, pp. 447-448. it was probably a festival for Zeus,Parker 2005, p. 447. and was celebrated in the spring after the City Dionysia in the middle of the month of Elaphebolion (late March and early April). Dates The exact date of the Pandia has been much discussed.Mikalson 1975, p. 137. Demosthenes, speech Against Midias (21.8) has a meeting, during which the conduct of the City Dionysia was reviewed, being held after the Pandia. This places the Pandia, at least during the time of Demosthenes, after the City Dionysia. Some have seen an association between the Pandia and the full-moon, placing the celebration on 14 Elaphebolion.Smith, \\"Pandia\\", \\"Dionysia\\"; Cook, p. 733; Willetts, pp. 178; Robertson 1996, p. 75 note 109. But according to Pickard- Cambridge, Gould and Lewis, the association with the full-moon \\"can neither be affirmed nor rejected\\",Pickard-Cambridge, Gould and Lewis, p. 66. and modern scholarship appears to favor the later dates of 16 or 17 Elaphebolion.Harris, p. 190; Canevaro, p. 213; Pickard-Cambridge, Gould and Lewis, p. 66; Mikalson 1975, p. 137. Rites The derivation of the festival's name and exactly whom the festival may have honored have been the subject of considerable discussion.For example see Willetts, pp. 178-179; Smith, \\"Pandia\\"; Harpers, \\"Pandia\\"; Photius, Lexicon s.v. Œ†Œ¨ŒΩŒ¥ŒπŒ±; Scholiast on Demosthenes, 21.39a; Lexicon Patmense s.v. Œ†Œ¨ŒΩŒ¥ŒπŒ±; Lexica Segueriana s.v. Œ†Œ¨ŒΩŒ¥ŒπŒ± (Bekker, p. 292). For possible meanings of the name see Cook, p. 423 note 2 which derives it from the adjective Œî·øñŒøœÉ, meaning 'of' or 'belonging to Zeus', see also Parker 1996, p. 75, however Robertson 1996, p. 75 note 109 says that while \\"the festival name Pandia is sometimes thought to mean \\"Common festival of Zeus\\"-- i.e. one celebrated jointly by several communities, ... the true meaning is surely \\"Rites of the all-bright sky\\". Zeus, the goddess Selene, Pandia, a daughter of Zeus and Selene, and Pandion, a mythical king, have all been seen as being possibly connected with the festival. The name \\"Pandia\\" is associated with the goddess Selene, the Greek personification of the moon. Originally Pandia may have been an epithet of Selene,Willetts, p. 178; Cook, p. 732; Roscher, p. 100; Scholiast on Demosthenes, 21.39a. but by at least the time of the Homeric Hymn to Selene,Hymn to Selene (32) 15-16. Pandia (\\"all brightness\\")Fairbanks, p. 162. Regarding the meaning of \\"Pandia\\", Kerenyi, p. 197, says: '\\"the entirely shining\\" or the \\"entirely bright\\"-- doubtless the brightness of nights of full moon.' had become a daughter of Selene and Zeus, and Pandia Selene or Selene's daughter Pandia, have been offered as possible origins for the name of the festival. Another mythological figure whose name has been suggested as a possible source for the name of the festival is Pandion, a legendary king of Athens who, as part of the tribal reforms of Cleisthenes at the end of the sixth century BC, became the eponymous hero of the Athenian tribe Pandionis. However some scholars think it is more likely that the hero derived his name from the festival as its legendary founder.Parke, p. 136; Kearns, pp. 81, 87, 192; Sourvinou-Inwood, p. 74; Parker 2005, p. 448; Lexicon Patmense s.v. Œ†Œ¨ŒΩŒ¥ŒπŒ±. According to Kearns pp. 68-69, there was \\"a very wide spread cultic-mythic phenomenon in which a hero or heroine is worshipped in conjunction with a god, while an aetiological myth explains that he or she was the first to perform the rite.\\" An inscriptionInscriptiones Graecae, II2 1140, line 5. dating from c. 386 BC, which refers to a decree of the tribe Pandionis, commending a \\"priest of Pandion\\" for services performed at the Pandia, supports the notion of a link between Pandion and the festival.Canevaro, p 212; Harding, p. 42; Anderson, p. 130, p. 251 note 15; Robertson 1993, p. 15; Parke, p. 136. While mentioning both Selene and Pandion in connection with the festival's name, Photius states that the festival was held for Zeus,Cook, p. 732; Photius, Lexicon s.v. Œ†Œ¨ŒΩŒ¥ŒπŒ±. and although according to Robert Parker this association with Zeus may only be \\"a probably correct etymological guess\\",Parker 2005, p. 478. many scholars are content to assign the festival to Zeus.For example see: Harris, p. 190; Harding, p. 42; Anderson, p. 130; Sourvinou-Inwood, p. 74; Robertson 1996, p. 41, p. 65 note 1; Parke, pp. 135-136. It is also possible that more than one of these mythological figures were associated with the festival, and who the festival honored may have changed over time.Kearns, p. 81, says \\"If the Pandia were a festival of Zeus, as the Panathenaia of Athena, it is nonetheless clear that the Pandion received a lesser sacrifice\\"; Smith, \\"Pandia\\" says \\"It is not impossible that in course of time the tribe Pandionis may have regarded themselves as specially connected with this festival, though we have no clear evidence of it, nor again that Zeus, as Preller thinks, may afterwards have been associated in the worship\\"; and Cook, p. 732 says \\"that the festival Pandia was ab initio connected with this Selene Pandia is far from clear\\", while Willetts, p. 179 sees a possible \\"metamorphosis\\" ... from a female to a male--Pandia to Pandion\\". Regarding the possibility of multiple honorees for Attic festivals see Parker 2005, p. 155, which says: \\"ancient scholars were uncertain what god two festivals (Skira, Oschophoria) belonged to, and the controversy has continued into modern times. But in both cases it seems that it is the principle of 'one god per festival' that is at fault.\\" Pandia of Plotheia A festival of the same name is attested for the deme Plotheia; what relationship if any this festival may have had with the Pandia of Athens is unknown.Mikalson 1977, p. 430; Parker 2005, pp. 73-74; p. 74 note 96, pp. 477-478; Dillon and Garland, pp. 354-355; Inscriptiones Graecae, I3 258, line 9.

In 1658, the Dutch agreed with David Nassy to establish a colony of Jews on the Pomeroon River, which flourished, becoming a prized possession of the Dutch, until its destruction in 1666 by an incursion by the English from Barbados under Major John Scott. The Jews of Pomeroon (Bowroom) fled, following the destruction of their colony, mostly to Suriname, where they were granted unprecedented religious freedoms. By the 1930s there was neither an organized Jewish community nor a synagogue in the capital city of Georgetown. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, several Jewish families immigrated to British Guiana from Arab lands to avoid persecution and expand business opportunities. History =Pre 20th Century= British Guiana was part of the expanding British Empire, which included much of the Middle East. The expansion of the sugar cane industry in British Guiana allowed the British to encourage workers (initially indentured Portuguese from Madeira, and then East Indians from South India), and the expansion of the economy brought opportunities to Jews from warm lands to emigrate. Most of the Jewish migration during this period came from British controlled portions of the Middle East including what is now modern Iraq, and were erroneously identified as Assyrians and called \\"Syrians.\\" Prominent among these families were affluent Jews including the Elias family from Palestine who ran several mercantile exchanges until the great fires of the 1960s burn them out. There were also several other Jewish merchant families erroneously identified as Arabs. Until the 1960s, there were close to a few hundred Jewish merchants who were categorized as \\"Syrians\\". Most of the Jews returned to the Middle East after racial resentment and political upheaval culminated with race riots of the 1960s. =20th century= Prior to World War II, the leadership of Nazi Germany discussed the possibility of exiling the German Jewish population to British Guiana. Winston Churchill had also raised the possibility of relocating up to 250,000 Jews to British Guiana, but his proposal was rejected by then-Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. In early 1939, 165 Jewish refugees travelling on the S.S. Koenigstein from Europe were refused disembarkation and entry, and not long after the government prohibition immigration. After World War II began, the British colonial administration in charge of Guyana agreed to provide shelter for 50 Jewish refugees who escaped Europe through Spain. These refugees emigrated after the war. =21st century= Today there are a few Jewish communities in Georgetown. Notable people Janet Jagan, an American-born Jewish woman married to a Guyanese national, served as prime minister from March 17, 1997, to December 19, 1997, and as president of Guyana from December 19, 1997, to August 11, 1999. However, Jagan downplayed her faith, telling a journalist in a 2000 interview that \\"Jewishness wasn't much of a factor in my life.\\" Jagan also added that as of 2000, \\"There's no Jewish community in Guyana.\\" See also * Demographics of Guyana * List of Caribbean Jews * History of the Jews * History of Guyana References External links * JNS - The Jewish Guianas * Category:Religion in Guyana Category:Ethnic groups in Guyana Category:British Guiana in World War II ","title":"History of the Jews in Guyana"},{"id":"40168828","text":"Saukuchi is a locality in southern part of Guwahati surrounded by Lokhra and Ghoramara localities.

In 1958, she became the first woman to be awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship, the highest honour conferred by the Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama. Acclaimed for her beauty in her youth, Malpekar was the muse of painters Raja Ravi Varma and M. V. Dhurandhar. Early life and background Malpekar was born on 22 April 1883, in Malpe in Goa, in music loving family that belonged to Goan Kalavant community. Both her grandmother Gujabai and mother Nabubai were respected names in music circles. At young age of 8, she started her musical training under the tutelage of Ustad Nazeer Khan of Bhendibazaar gharana. The gharana had its origins in the much older Moradabad gharana, and was based in the Bhendi Bazaar area of Mumbai. Career \\"Mohini on a swing\\" or \\"Mohini\\" (1894 by Raja Ravi Varma). Malpekar gave her debut performance at a concert in Mumbai in 1899, at the age of 16. In those days, women of \\"respectable families\\" never sang in public, while Malepakar went on to have a flourishing singing career, with both public and royal patronage. In time, she became the doyenne of the gharana. Besides her singing, she also got acclaim for her beauty. When painter M. V. Dhurandhar did an oil painting of her, another painter Raja Ravi Varma was inspired, and went to do a series of paintings with her as muse, including \\"Lady in the Moonlight\\", \\"Lady Playing Swarbat\\", \\"Mohini\\" and \\"The Heartbroken\\", She modelled for him during his stay in Mumbai in 1901 and 1903. However this wasn't without its drawback, especially when singing in public concerts meant singing primarily to a male audience, this often led to harassment. Thus in 1904, she even developed fear of singing in public, and lost her voice, though she regained it after a year. Meanwhile, she married Seth Wasanji Ved. After a successful career as a singer, after the death of her Guru Ustad Nazeer Khan in 1920, she lost interest in concerts. Finally, after a last performance at Town Hall, Mumbai, she gave up her public singing career in 1923. Thus at age 40, she decided to devote the rest of her years, to teaching music. In the coming decades, she taught some notable names in Indian classical music, including Kumar Gandharva who was her first disciple, Kishori Amonkar, Pandit T.D. Janorikar (1921‚Äì2006), Begum Akhtar and Naina Devi. By the 1960s, Bhendibazar gharana based in Mumbai, became famous all over India, with number of popular musicians, besides Aman Ali Khan, it had Jhande Khan, Mamman Khan, Shabbir and Amir Khan. In 1958, when for her contribution to music, she was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship the highest honour conferred by Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama, she became the first woman to receive the award. She died on 7 August 1974 in Bombay (now Mumbai), at the age of 91.

KHCC offers programs and services in multiple sites for more than 4,500 people annually. Guided by the settlement house model of community development and involvement, KHCC is a member of United Neighborhood Houses of New York City. KHCC‚Äôs mission is to ‚Äúempower Bronx residents from cradle to career to advance education and well-being for a vibrant community. ‚Äù KHCC serves low- and moderate-income residents, providing a variety of programs for all age groups. Programs include early childhood education, college preparation, school-age after school and teen evening programs; counseling services to families, adults and senior citizens; and respite services for developmentally-disabled youth and adults. Some of these programs serve the entire borough of the Bronx, including the Child Sexual Abuse Treatment and Prevention, and College Directions Program. The Center‚Äôs main office is located in the former 50th Precinct Police Station House, (originally the 40th Precinct Police Station House), 3101 Kingsbridge Terrace, Bronx, built by architects Arthur J. Hogan and Vincent J. Slattery in 1902. The building was designated a New York City landmark in 1986.  History  The former 50th Precinct Police Station House is an example of Beaux-Arts classicism, an architectural style typical for public architecture at the turn-of-the-century that became the emblem of the City Beautiful Movement. Its style, scale, materials of construction, direct relation to the street, and ornament contribute to the monumental character, which distinguishes the building from the surrounding structures. Upon hearing in 1972 that the 50th Precinct was moving out of its building, Mary MacLoughlin began a three-year writing campaign to convince City Hall to give the building to the community to realize her vision of a community center modeled after the New York settlement houses, providing educational and cultural activities for all community residents. Through the support of then- Assemblyman Oliver Koppell, Bronx Borough President Robert Abrams, community residents Patricia Burns and Janet Athanasidy, as well as other community activists, the building was secured on Dec. 27, 1974. The center opened during the spring of 1975 with a teen program and a Head Start Program and a budget of $500,000 to continue renovating the facility. In 1979, with funding from the New York City Capital Budget and the Federal Community Development Budget, the community center embarked on a major rehabilitative program which was completed in 1981. During the 1980s, the agency added services to prevent and treat child abuse and neglect, adult education, and expanded youth programs. In 1991 it opened College Directions, one of the first community-based college access programs in the city, and in 1997 added Early Head Start services. The center was led by the executive director Charles Shayne between 1985 and 2010 who built the Center into one of the leading service agencies in the Bronx, adding new programs, new buildings, and new supporters, as well as founding and coordinating the Bronx Cluster of Settlement Houses with eight other agencies. Upon his retirement, Giselle Melendez-Susca was promoted as the new Executive Director. Today, KHCC provides thousands of Bronx residents with services ranging from prenatal care to senior services and is an active member of United Neighborhood Houses of New York City and United Neighborhood Centers of America. In August 2013, KHCC was awarded a $1.9 million grant by the City of New York for the construction of a new building to expand its facilities due to growing demand for early childhood, abuse and special needs programs. The new facility will allow 200 additional families to get services, and will accommodate both autistic children and young adults. On July 27, 2013, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor joined the children from the KHCC in a workshop hosted by the Bronx Children's Museum and GrowNYC.org. as part of the museum's Dream Big program.  Services  Services provided by Kingsbridge Heights Community Center include the following programs:A Teen Green Market in front of the center Head Start is designed to provide support to families of preschoolers to enhance the child‚Äôs development through building of educational skills, social emotional development and school readiness goals. The center also offers the Early Head Start program serving families and children from pregnancy through the three years of age. Parents and children can participate in the three program options offered: Combination Program Option, Family Child Care Option or the Pregnancy Option. The Head Start and Early Head Start programs served 114 and 163 families respectively in 2012. Teen Center is open to youth between the ages of 11 and 21. The Tween Program offers activities tailored to the age group of youth in grades 6 to 8. A farmer‚Äôs market run completely by teens from the community is also organized by the center to promote a healthy lifestyle and reduce obesity as a part of the New York City Departments of Health & Mental Hygiene and Transportation Play Street initiative, which offers a wide range of health and arts activities for Bronx families. College Directions works to increase the number of Bronx youth who are well-informed about the benefits of a college education and to support them as they move through the application process and into college. The majority of its participants are from low-income households and many are first-generation college students. The program assists college applicants every step of the way, from searching to scholarships to writing the application essay. The program helps students explore career options, prepare for the SAT, and offers one-on-one guidance. Special Needs Program provides environment and structured opportunities for learning, growth, and socializing with peers for children and adults with developmental or intellectual disability, autism, or down syndrome. The Special Needs After School Program offers young people between 5 and 21 years of age homework help, tutoring, adaptive physical education and other services. Saturday and Sunday programs serve people up to age 25 through participation in recreational trips to community venues. Child Sexual Abuse Treatment and Prevention Program provides free treatment to children in the Bronx, ages 3 to 21. Services include therapy, workshops and trainings, and advocacy. The center also offers individual therapy and group therapy to adult survivors of child sexual abuse and other types of trauma. In 2013, KHCC produced LISTEN TO ME: stories of child sexual abuse survivors and those who help them in collaboration with Ping Chong + Company as part of its Secret Survivors National Initiative. In the 40 minute production therapists from KHCC share their own stories, as well as give voice to the experiences of child survivors who have gone through KHCC‚Äôs child sexual abuse prevention and treatment program. ESL and Citizenship courses: the center offers English as a second language classes and workshops focusing on citizenship, immigrant rights and financial literacy. In addition, the center offers free tax filing for families in need.

History The company, which was established as the European arm of Premier Farnell, introduced the element14 brand name in 2010, replacing the legacy brands of Premier Electronics, Farnell and Farnell-Newark with Farnell element14 and Newark element14. The name was taken from silicon, the 14th element in the Periodic Table, which is widely used in electronic components such as integrated circuits and discrete semiconductors. Products Development kits (often called ‚Äòdev kits‚Äô) are a major specialism of Farnell element14. These are hardware kits typically centred around a particular microprocessor or microcontroller and are used by design engineers to develop and prototype new products. A survey of engineers on the element14 Community identified the big areas for the market in 2014-2015 as being lighting control, sensing and wireless. Another growth area for Farnell element14 is the Internet of Things (IoT), which was the predominant theme at its stall at the electronica fair held in Munich on 11-14 November 2014, showcasing element14 IoT products such as the RIoTboard.

Rusuti belonged, along with Jacopo Torriti and Pietro Cavallini, to the so- called Roman school active in the late thirteenth century. Early in his career he worked on the fresco decoration of the Upper Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi, perhaps alongside or after Torriti. The work included some parts of the story of Genesis, in particular the creation of Adam and Eve and perhaps the construction of Noah's Ark. His only signed work is the upper register of the mosaic decoration of the old facade of the Roman church of Santa Maria Maggiore, where the presence of Cardinal Pietro Colonna allows dating of the mosaic between 1288 and 1297. Art historians believe that the lower register of the same mosaic, with the stories of the founding of the Santa Maria Liberiana, is to be considered an intervention a few years later by the followers of Rusuti based on his drawings. It was rebuilt for the presence of Rusuti (with his son John) in Poitiers, on the basis of a more careful reading of documents (now lost) which attest to a Filippus Bizuti or rather Ruzuti in 1309, in 1316‚Äì17, in the service of the king of France, but perhaps also in the wake of a column at the papal court in Avignon. Around 1319 Rusuti went to Naples at the Angevins court following Cavallini for the fresco decoration of the church of Santa Maria Donna Regina Vecchia, where his figures are probably the Prophets. Still in Naples, around 1320 he created some scenes from the Life of Christ in the Brancacci Chapel. In early June 2010, the artist and scholar Alfred Breitman attributed frescoes discovered in a tower of the palace Senate in the Capitol to Filippo Rusuti, with the consensus of historians of ancient art.

Background Conniff was the oldest of five children born in New Orleans to the former Mary Orleana Robinson (1850-1917), whose family tree is traced to a family in colonial Delaware, and John Harris Conniff (1850-1909), the president of the Crescent News and Hotel Company with interests also in the New Orleans entertainment industry‚Äîthe St. Charles Theatre, the Academy of Music, and the Grand Opera House. The senior Coniffs are interred at Greenwood Cemetery in New Orleans. Young Coniff graduated in 1890 from the high school of Roman Catholic-affiliated Tulane University. In 1894, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Tulane, where he became affiliated with Phi Delta Theta fraternity. Conniff then studied law for a year at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia. Academic career From 1895 to 1900, Conniff taught English and Latin at Boys' High School in New Orleans; from 1900 to 1908, he was assistant superintendent of New Orleans public schools and from 1908 to 1910 the acting superintendent. In 1910, he moved to Baton Rouge to head the teacher certification division of the Louisiana Department of EducationHenry E. Chambers, A History of Louisiana, Vol. 2 (Chicago and New York City: American Historical Society, 1925), pp. 53-54 under superintendent T. H. Harris. Conniff was a devotee of physical education and was the president of the first Tulane Baseball League and the Southern Athletic Club of New Orleans. In 1905, he helped to establish the Public School Athletic League of New Orleans and served as its long-term secretary. Considering his father's ownership of entertainment enterprises, Conniff participated in theatrical performances in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, where he helped to create the Little Theatre Guild. In 1923, while working at the state education department, Conniff received his Master of Arts degree from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. His thesis entails a study of English drama and theatrical performances prior to 1642. Like his father, Conniff was an active Democrat and a member of the National Education Association and the former white-only Louisiana Teachers Association, since the bi-racial Louisiana Association of Educators. He was a member of the Baton Rouge Golf and Country Club. Conniff relocated from Baton Rouge to Ruston in 1926 to become the president of Louisiana Tech, having succeeded John Ephraim Keeny, who stepped down after eighteen years at the helm. On leaving Louisiana Tech after two years at the helm, Conniff returned to New Orleans, where he joined the faculty of the all-male Warren Easton High School, now a charter school.Lee Harvey Oswald attended Warren Easton for just over a month in October 1957, ten months after Conniff's death. At Warren Easton, Conniff resumed his teaching of English and Latin. During summers he taught the History of Louisiana at his alma mater, Tulane University.Ruston Daily Leader, June 17, 1936, p. 4 Death Conniff and his wife, the former Bertha Drott (1882-1971), had one son, John R.

Early life James Stewart was the fourth son of Sir James Steuart of Coltness (1608‚Äì1681), a banker in Edinburgh and Lord Provost of Edinburgh, and Anne Hope, niece of Sir Thomas Hope. He was the brother of Sir Robert Steuart, 1st Baronet of Allanbank (1643‚Äì1707) and Sir Thomas Stewart of Coltness, 1st Baronet. Career He was called to the bar on 20 November 1661, but lost almost all his practice defending his father against a charge of embezzlement. =In exile= Stewart found it necessary to leave the country because of a pamphlet, and went to Rouen, where he became a merchant under the name of Graham. Some years afterwards he returned to Scotland, but he was suspected of having had a hand in a further political pamphlet, An Account of Scotlands Grievances by reason of the Duke of Lauderdale's Ministry (1675), an order was issued for his apprehension. He escaped, and in England under the name of Lawson. In 1678, Stewart opened a small office in London, where he gave legal advice at half fees, his clerk meeting the clients and transmitting their statements to the invisible Stewart. Returning to Scotland in 1679, he again got into trouble in 1681, when among the papers of Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll a memorandum in his hand was found, reflecting on the government. He took refuge in The Hague. He was present at the meeting at Amsterdam in 1685, when the expedition of Argyll was resolved on. Stewart having prepared Argyll's declaration of war, he was accused of treasonably consulting and contriving Argyll's rebellion, He was found guilty in his absence. His sentence was to be executed whenever he could be found. =Later life= Stewart was pardoned by James II of Great Britain in 1687, and returned to London. His actions have been interpreted as those of a double agent. On account of his supposed influence with the presbyterian party, he was received into favour, and employed to conduct crown cases along with George Mackenzie. In 1692, after the Glorious Revolution, Stewart was appointed Lord Advocate, and during his term of office introduced legal reforms in Scotland. He was elected Dean of the Faculty of Advocates until 1695. In December 1696 Stewart was the prosecutor in the last execution for blasphemy in the United Kingdom with the case of Thomas Aikenhead. Stewart demanded the death penalty to set an example to others who might otherwise express such opinions in the future. He resigned his position as Lord Advocate in 1709. He died in 1715 in his house at the foot of what is now Advocates CloseCassell's Old and New Edinburgh, and was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard. Stewart is the advocate who gives his name to Advocates Close. Works An anonymous work Naphthali, or, The Wrestlings of the Church of Scotland (1667) is now attributed to Stewart and the Covenanter minister James Stirling, with Stewart supplying the legal portion. It defended the Pentland Rising of 1666, in the context of the repression of the Presbyterians since 1660. In 1669 Stewart published a political pamphlet Jus Populi Vindicatum, or the People's Right to defend themselves, and their Covenanted Reign vindicated, as a reply to Andrew Honeyman's Survey of Naphtali (1668).

It was the 14th race in the 2013 IndyCar Series season. The pole position was held by Ryan Hunter-Reay of Andretti Autosport, while Chip Ganassi Racing's Charlie Kimball won the race. Report =Background= The race was the seventh running since it became a part of the IndyCar schedule, and was dominated by Chip Ganassi Racing, with Scott Dixon winning four times and teammate Dario Franchitti winning once in 2010. The lone non-Ganassi win was by Team Penske's Ryan Briscoe in 2008. IndyCar extended the race by five laps to 90 laps to prevent the race from not having much competition and being determined by the driver who can manage their fuel mileage the best. The past three races at Pocono and Toronto had been dominated by Dixon, with the Toronto sweep making him the winningest active driver in IndyCar with 32 wins, tied with Franchitti, Paul Tracy and S√©bastien Bourdais. The three consecutive wins placed Dixon in contention for the championship, 29 points behind leader H√©lio Castroneves. Chip Ganassi Racing's three wins in 2013 are second to Andretti Autosport's five victories, with James Hinchcliffe winning three and Ryan Hunter-Reay winning two. Takuma Sato (A. J. Foyt Enterprises), Tony Kanaan (KV Racing Technology), Mike Conway (Dale Coyne Racing), Simon Pagenaud (Sam Schmidt Motorsports) and Helio Castroneves (Team Penske) won the other five races. =Qualifying= Ryan Hunter-Reay of Andretti Autosport won the pole with a lap speed of 1:05.3519, barely missing the record set by Dario Franchitti and Gil de Ferran in 1999 and 2000, respectively, falling .0049 seconds short. Hunter-Reay stated that the reason he fell short of the record was because he was not driving through turn 13 cleanly. Will Power was .1840 behind Hunter-Reay, and Scott Dixon started third. Marco Andretti (1:05.8566), Charlie Kimball (1:06.4638), Dario Franchitti (1:07.1793), Justin Wilson (1:05.9405), Simon Pagenaud (1:05.9412), Simona de Silvestro (1:05.9621) and James Jakes (1:06.1778) rounded out the top ten starting grid. Race During the race, much of the race leaders conserved fuel, attempting to finish the race with only two pit stops. Charlie Kimball, who was running a backup car due to wrecking his primary car in practice, had three stops, and led a race- high 46 laps; Kimball had led only 15 laps in his IndyCar career prior. Kimball competed with Simon Pagenaud for much of the race, and while attempting to pass Pagenaud, who was exiting pit road, Kimball's right tires slid into the grass, but eventually made the pass after three corners with 18 laps to go while heading into turn 5. Kimball held off Pagenaud for his first career IndyCar Series win by a margin of 5.5 seconds; it was his first win in any racing series since 2006, when he won a Formula 3 Euro Series race. Kimball became the first driver with diabetes to win an IndyCar race. Dario Franchitti, Will Power and Ryan Hunter-Reay closed out the top five, while H√©lio Castroneves, Scott Dixon, Justin Wilson, Marco Andretti and James Hinchcliffe rounded out the top ten. For the second year in a row, the race ran in its entirety without a caution period.

The libretto was written by Schikaneder. Composition Der Stein der Weisen was composed using a \\"team approach\\" in which each composer contributed individual sections of the piece. All five wrote parts of act 2, and all except Mozart wrote parts of act 1. Henneberg composed the work's overture. Schikaneder wrote the libretto for the entire piece. The text is based on a fairy tale from Christoph Martin Wieland's ', published in the late 1780s. All five were later involved in The Magic Flute: Mozart as composer, Schikaneder as librettist, impresario and performer (Papageno), Henneberg as conductor, and Schack and Gerl as performers (respectively Tamino and Sarastro). Der Stein der Weisen may have provided a model for that work, as the two have a similar structure and source. Reception and study The work was initially popular, but was largely absent from the standard repertoire for the two centuries after 1814, American musicologist David Buch announced the discovery of a Viennese score with attributions to all five composers. This was taken by some to indicate that Der Stein der Weisen was a previously unknown Mozart work, although in fact only a duet (\\"Nun liebes Weibchen\\", known as the \\"cat duet\\") and two sections of the act 2 finale were attributed to him. The autograph of \\"Nun liebes Weibchen\\" (K. 625) is held by the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris; the rest of the original score is lost. The work is known from a ca. 1795 copy. Performances The singspiel was premiered on 11 September 1790 in the Theater auf der Wieden, conducted by Henneberg. It was first recorded by the Boston Baroque in 1999. It was performed by Bampton Classical Opera in 2002.

It is located over the Klang River in the city of Klang, Selangor. The longer upper deck was built for motorised vehicle traffic, while the shorter lower deck was used for pedestrians and bicycles only. The bridge originally had a span of , but part of the bridge has been removed to allow for the construction of a new bridge alongside it. The upper deck has been converted to a public space and no longer permits automobile traffic, but the lower deck is still open to pedestrians, bicycles and motorcycles. History A bridge, the Belfield Bridge, originally served the town of Klang, but was bombed during the Japanese invasion in the Second World War. After the war, three bridges were used temporarily to cross the river as the Belfield Bridge could not be repaired. In 1951, Crown Agents were sent from London to study the feasibility of constructing a new permanent bridge over the Klang River, from which the idea of a double-decked bridge emerged. The bridge was constructed between 1958 and 1960 and it was a reinforced steel truss girder bridge. It was constructed by Dorman Long Engineering Limited, the company that was also responsible for building the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932, with piling works by Gammon Messrs (Malaya) Ltd. Its cost was estimated to be ¬£820,000 in 1956. The bridge had a total length of including approaches with a central span of . The bridge was first launched in 1959 by the late Sultan of Selangor, Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah. It was originally intended to be named Alam Shah Bridge after the sultan, but Sultan Hisamuddin decided two weeks before opening that it should be called Kota Bridge (\\"kota\\" means \\"city\\") after the Bukit Kota Palace. The bridge was completed in 1960 and officially opened in 1961 by Almarhum Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah in conjunction with his coronation as the ninth Sultan of Selangor. In the 1990s, due to the high capacity traffic with the upgrading of the Federal Highway Route (Klang - Kuala Lumpur) into six lane carriageway toll highway from 1991 to 1993. The double-decked bridge was closed to traffic and the new concrete bridge with six lane carriageway was built beside the original double-decked bridge. The north end of the Kota Bridge was removed to allow the new bridge to be built, but about 300m of the bridge remained. Usage View from upper deck of bridge, now serving as a public space The bottom deck is a pedestrian walkway bridge while the top deck was originally used as a motor vehicle bridge. The top deck has been closed to traffic when a new bridge was built alongside it, while the bottom deck continues to be used as a bridge for pedestrians, bicycles and motocycles. In the 1990s, the top deck of bridge was renovated into public space called Dataran Jambatan Kota (Kota Bridge Square). The bridge has been used a film location for the Malaysian production Sangkar as well as for commercials. An attempt to have the bridge gazetted as a national heritage site was launched in 2019.

It stars Abigail Breslin, Alexander Ludwig, and Wes Bentley. Breslin plays a young woman who is trained from childhood to defeat a group of high school boys who hunt and kill their female classmates. Cinedigm gave it a limited release in cinemas and through video on demand on August 14, 2015.  Plot  A five-year-old Veronica meets with a man named William after her parents have died. He offers to take her in and train her for a job that is only for \\"special\\" people, explaining that his wife and child were killed by \\"a very bad man‚Äù. She accepts. Twelve years later, Veronica prepares to finish training. William injects her with a combination of truth serum and DMT, a hallucinatory drug, to confront her greatest fear, so she can understand what her victims will be experiencing. Despite believing herself fearless, Veronica confronts her greatest fear: failing her mission. Four seventeen-year-old boys named Jameson, Daniel, Nelson, and Shane meet at a diner. Jameson chooses women for the group to hunt and kill; their latest prey is a girl named Gwen. The boys take her to the woods, where they murder her. On a recon mission, Veronica meets Shane's girlfriend, Jennifer, at the diner. They bond over their boy issues, revealing Veronica's romantic feelings for William despite their age difference and her awareness that he is emotionally unavailable. Jennifer tells her the boys are on the verge of falling apart. Next, using herself as bait, Veronica meets Jameson at the diner and accepts a date. The boys pick her up at the diner and take her to the woods, where they play truth or dare. Offering a whiskey flask to the boys from her purse, she tricks all except Jameson into drinking the hallucinogen. She draws the dare 'Die' and begs to go home. Jameson gives her five minutes to run, but the boys do not wait and go after her immediately. As the drugs take effect, Daniel hallucinates two panda heads in suits coming after him; it is actually Veronica, who kills him with his own axe. Next, Veronica goes after Nelson, who sees a group of faceless thugs encircling him. His mother appears and they kiss deeply before he dies as Veronica crushes his head with a rock. Shane's worst fear is his girlfriend cheating on him with Jameson and discovering his true nature; Veronica kills him as well. Jameson discovers his friends' bodies and is intrigued. He comes face to face with Veronica, and proposes a game of asking questions that the other must answer truthfully. Jameson says he has killed 21 women, counting her. When Veronica reveals she enjoyed killing his friends, he proposes they work together, but she declines. They fight until he passes out from a choke-hold that William taught Veronica earlier. She forces him to drink the drugged alcohol and, when he awakens, finds himself standing on a tree stump with a noose around his neck. He swears that he will never kill again but Veronica does not believe him. As the drugs take effect, his victims, including Gwen, come out of the trees and move toward him. In his terror, Jameson steps off the tree stump and hangs himself. William appears and congratulates Veronica, and they go to the diner to eat pancakes.

He was also a published poet.Chris Spencer, \\"Writer Brian Burland to be buried today\\", The Royal Gazette, 16 February 2010. Burland was the first Bermudian novelist to receive international acclaim. Early years Brian Berkeley Burland was born in Bermuda in 1931, to Gordon Burland and his wife Honor (n√©e Gosling), and was one of four siblings.\\"Brian Berkeley Burland\\", Bermuda Biographies. His was a privileged family background, but from an early age Brian was very conscious of Bermuda's racial inequalities and empathised with black Bermudians: \\"An important figure in his early life was Sarah Hinson, his black Bermudian nanny who... appears in his novel The Flight of the Cavalier as a heroic figure. Burland's family honoured his request to be buried next to her at St. Paul's Church, Paget.\\" Education Burland began his education at Saltus Grammar School in Hamilton, Bermuda, before being sent to England in 1944 as a boarder to Aldenham School in Hertfordshire. His experiences on the ship crossing the Atlantic crossing during World War II would be evoked in his early novel A Fall from Aloft (1968). Burland subsequently attended the University of Western Ontario in Canada, where he took a graduate English course, but dropped out without graduating. Travelling to Ireland, he began working on his first novel. On the death of his father in 1951 Burland returned to Bermuda and worked in the family construction company for five years. During this time he played with a black cricket team, \\"which raised eyebrows from blacks and whites... and gave him material for his novels.\\" In 1956 he sold his interest in the company, and, aged 26, went to Jamaica. There he met No√´l Coward, who was impressed with a short story of Burland's. Publication It was not until 1964, however, that Burland began to be published, with his first book, St. Nicholas in the Tub, being produced in the US. His next novel, A Fall From Aloft, was published in the United Kingdom in 1968, followed by A Few Flowers for St. George (1970), Undertow (1961) and in 1973, The Sailor and the Fox. Burland's other published novels are Surprise (1975), Stephen Decatur, the Devil and the Endymion (1975), Flight of the Cavalier (1980) and Love is a Durable Fire (1985).

The Times in London, the New Statesman and The New York Times, being praised by the likes of novelist Anthony Burgess, playwright David Rabe and actor Sir Ralph Richardson. In response to one rare, particularly negative review, Burland wrote a letter to The New York Times in July 1986, taking the reviewer to task: > \\"I am 55 years old. I have worked five days a week, 50 weeks a year, for > over 30 years, as a novelist and poet. I set myself rather high standards: > that unless the story is at once as unputdownable to a taxi driver as to a > university professor, it is not good enough; that unless a novel is, at the > end, quite clearly an epic poem, as well as a story, it is not good enough. > My work has resulted in the publication of eight novels by 16 publishers, > now adding up to 22 editions.

He became the first president of the United Transportation Union, when that organization was formed by merging the BRT and three other railroad unions in 1969. Early years Charles Luna was born in Celeste, Texas in 1906. While at high school he worked for the bridge and building department of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway during four summer vacations. After he completed high school in 1928 he joined this company as a switchman in its East Dallas yard. In 1929 he joined Dallas Lodge 671 of the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen. In 1936 he was elected a member of the Dallas-area grievance committee of the railway company, and from 1940 to 1946 was chairman of the grievance committee. From 1943 to 1946 he was also a deputy president of the national organization. In 1947 he started to work for the Brotherhood full-time as General Chairman of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe. In 1949 and 1953 he sat on the national committee to bargain on all members' wages and working conditions. In 1954 he was made Vice-President responsible for Denver, Colorado, and later for Dallas, Texas. In the 1960 convention he was elected designated successor to president William Parker Kennedy. In 1961 he moved to headquarters in Cleveland, Ohio, where he chaired the key committee on wages and conditions. Union leader Luna became president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen in 1963. He succeeded W.P. Kennedy, who retired at the end of 1962 at the age of 70. On 1 January 1969 the BRT merged with three other unions to form the United Transportation Union. The others were the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen and the Switchmen‚Äôs Union of North America. Luna became president of the combined union, with 230,000 members. In 1969 Luna was elected chairman of the Congress of Railway Unions. In 1971 the UTU Insurance Association assumed the insurance and welfare plans of the brotherhoods who had formed the UTU. The UTU held its first national convention in August 1971 in Miami Beach. Al Chesser, National Legislative Director of the UTU, was elected to succeed Luna, who was retiring. Later years In 1970 Luna was chosen by President Richard Nixon to help form the National Railroad Passenger Corporation. This set up the Amtrak inter-city passenger service. Luna served as an Amtrac director for twenty years. Charles Luna died of a heart attack on 1 October 1992 at his home in Dallas, Texas. Amtrak‚Äôs highest safety honor is the Charles Luna Memorial Safety award, which has been presented annually since 1990.

A California-incorporated 501(c)(7) non-profit, social/recreational corporation, it is anchored by the Spreckels Lake Model Yacht Facility in Golden Gate Park which includes the lake itself and the SFMYC's WPA-era Clubhouse. The club draws its membership which varies annually between 120 and 160 from throughout northern and central-coastal California as well as nationally and overseas. Vintage postcard of the northwest corner of Spreckels Lake, c1904/05, looking north toward 36th Avenue and Fulton Street on left with the boats of the San Francisco Model Yacht Club.The San Francisco Model Yacht Club is a historically significant club as it was at the request of this group that Spreckels Lake was created, by the San Francisco Parks Commission between 1902 and 1904 as a lake dedicated specifically for model boat sailing and competition. The Parks Commission built the club's first clubhouse in 1909 from the remnants of the ‚Äòlittle‚Äô St. Francis Hotel near the Polo Fields and assisted when the SFMYC raised the funds via private subscription for the Works Progress Administration (WPA) to build the current clubhouse closer to Spreckels Lake at the 'corner' of JFK Drive and 36th Ave in the late 1930s, using funds raised by the model yacht club itself with some additional funding from San Francisco. After completion in 1938, the federal government, via charter, deeded the clubhouse in perpetuity to the Model Yacht Club. The San Francisco Model Yacht Club has always been part of the history of the lake and model yacht facility, and it can be said that neither could exist without the other. Founded in 1898, the club coalesced from a group of affiliated model boating enthusiasts, including a number of socially-prominent and wealthy San Franciscans. Originally home-ported at Golden Gate Park's Stow Lake, it is now the oldest, continuously operating model boating organization in the western hemisphere. Although other model boat clubs were formed prior to the SFMYC, such as the seminal Prospect Park Model Yacht Club in Brooklyn, New York, founded in 1872,\\"The History of American Yachting\\" by Capt R.F.Coffin, OUTING, Vol. VIII, No. 6, page 609, September 1886 none survived continuously to the present.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Cole Sanchez, from a story by Mark Banker, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and series creator Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on February 28, 2011. The episode guest stars Miguel Ferrer as Death; Ferrer would later reprise his role in the fourth season episode \\"Sons of Mars\\". The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake make a trip to the Land of the Dead after killing Princess Bubblegum's (voiced by Hynden Walch) plant when they were instructed to take care of it. After Jake's memory is wiped and Finn loses a musical duel against Death (voiced by Ferrer), the two are nearly killed until a lucky coincidence causes Death to spare them. Originally, the episode was supposed to revolve around the duo trying to get the plant back, lest Princess Bubblegum turn into a man. In addition, the episode originally was supposed to feature a mysterious rabbit that guided Finn and Jake through the Underworld; this character was later cut. The episode was watched by 1.981 million people and received largely positive critical attention. Many critics applauded Ferrer's voice acting work, and Matt Fowler of IGN singled the episode out as an example of the comedic darkening of Adventure Time. Plot While spending time with Finn and Jake, Princess Bubblegum realizes that she needs to leave for a science convention in the Veggie Village. She entrusts the two with guarding her Princess Plant. However, when she departs, Finn and Jake party too hard with the plant, killing it. They then decide on a way to journey into the Land of the Dead and to reclaim the flower's soul from Death himself. For an unspecified price, Peppermint Butler (voiced by Steve Little) teaches the two how to get into the Underworld, and he instructs Finn and Jake also to tell Death that he said hello. Once in the Land of the Death, Finn and Jake are nearly eaten by conscious skeletons, who crave flesh. While evading these monsters, Jake jumps into the \\"River of Forgetfulness\\" and loses his memory. Finn drags Jake all the way to Death's castle. Once inside, Death reveals that he will return the flower's soul if Finn can beat him in a musical showdown. Finn choose to play jingle bells, whereas Death plays drums and sings death metal. Jake, the now- impartial judge due to his memory loss, rules that Death wins. Because Finn and Jake lost the contest, Death decides to kill them. Before he dies, however, Finn tells Death that Peppermint Butler says hello; Death‚Äîrevealed to be an acquaintance of Peppermint Butler‚Äîsuddenly relents and tells the two that they can have \\"anything [they] want.\\" Death then returns Princess Plant's soul as well as Jake's memory before zapping Finn and Jake to the Candy Kingdom. Bubblegum returns, only to eat part of the plant, causing her hair to change. Peppermint Butler then asks for his payment: he wants both Finn and Jake's flesh, much to their horror. Production \\"Death in Bloom\\" was written and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Cole Sanchez, from a story by Mark Banker, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and series creator Pendleton Ward. The episode was directed by Larry Leichliter, with Pat McHale and Sanchez serving as creative co-directors and Nick Jennings serving as art director. Both Ward and fellow series storyboard artist Tom Herpich helped Moynihan and Sanchez clean up their story. One scene, in which Finn and Jake hide from the skeletons only to have Jake's flatulence alert them to their presence, was supposed to be storyboarded by Ward. However, he was extremely tired and offered Herpich $100‚Äîthe amount Ward would have earned had he done it‚Äîto storyboard the scene instead. The episode features an extremely long pan showing much of the Land of the Dead, which was designed by Moynihan. In the episode's storyboard, the pan takes up 7 pages; regarding this length, Moynihan later noted on his personal website that initially he \\"wanted to really go over the top and make it like 15 pages but 7 pages felt right\\". Moynihan's original pan was redesigned by background designer Dan \\"Ghostshrimp\\" James, who also did some of the other backgrounds for the episode. Other backgrounds were done by Chris Tsirgiotis, who, according to Moynihan, was doing his \\"best Ghostshrimp impression\\"; Tsirgiotis himself later noted that, \\"Matching Ghostshrimp‚Äôs drawing style is pretty tricky. It looks simple at first glance, but it‚Äôs actually very sophisticated and nuanced.\\" The scene wherein Peppermint Butler teaches Finn and Jake to enter the land of the dead by crossing their eyes and staring at a corner was inspired by a story that Moynihan's father told him when he was younger. According to the artist, his father told him that if you \\"concentrate really hard enough\\", you would \\"walk into another dimension\\". Moynihan recalled the story when he was storyboarding, and worked it into the episode. The climax featuring Death and Finn engaging in a musical competition was specifically written so as to not be \\"corny\\". According to Ward, scenes featuring contests were often avoided because they were \\"the easiest traps to fall into when you're writing an outline\\". For \\"Death in Bloom\\", the writing staff realized that a contest would work towards the story's strengths. In original drafts of the episode, Finn and Jake were guided through the Land of the Dead by a mysterious rabbit. While working on the episode, Sanchez continually felt that the rabbit was misplaced in the episode. Eventually, the writers and series staff began to agree with Sanchez, and when it came time to revise the episode, the rabbit was cut. The rabbit's role was later partially replaced by an ominous talking skull that tries to get Jake to drink from the \\"River of Forgetfulness\\". According to storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar, a rough draft for the original ending featured Princess Bubblegum becoming a man without the Princess Plant. Moynihan later noted that the writers were being a \\"little reckless\\" when it was pitched, and Ward joked that he had to step in and be \\"quality control\\" to prevent the idea from making it into the final episode. Death was voiced by Miguel Ferrer. Ferrer would later reprise his role in the fourth-season episode \\"Sons of Mars\\", and several subsequent episodes after that. Death's look was designed by Moynihan, who admitted on his personal website that he was somewhat intimidated with the task of redesigning such an iconic character. Moynihan deliberately avoided the stereotypical depiction of death with a robe and a sickle, instead choosing to experiment with both a \\"Japanese cosmic alien thing\\" and a \\"Jodorowsky/Holy Mountain inspired\\" design. The latter design won out, although Moynihan later changed the character's head into a horse skull. The design for the character was then finalized by Phil Rynda, who was the series' lead character designer at the time. Reception \\"Death in Bloom\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on October 11, 2010. The episode was viewed by 1.981 million viewers and scored a Nielsen rating of 1.2/2 percent. This means it was seen by 1.2 percent of all households and 2 percent of all households watching television at the time of the episode's airing. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2013 Fionna and Cake DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' first three seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete second season DVD in June 2013. Tyler Foster of DVD Talk wrote highly of the episode, and highlighted it as a stand-out of the second season. He applauded the way in which the series reinvented the idea of the Underworld, noting that its presentation was \\"hilarious in and of itself\\". In addition, he was complimentary towards Ferrer's performance as Death; in a review of the Fionna and Cake DVD, Foster referred to the actor's work as \\"hilarious\\" in the episode, and in a review of the second season, he wrote that \\"if 'Miguel Ferrer as Death' isn't a perfect four-word tease pitch for the show's genius, I don't know what is.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN cited the episode as a season highlight, writing that the episode's best part is when \\"Finn has a 'death metal-off' with Death\\". He also noted that the episode is important to the series as a whole, as it is one of the many second season entries that marks a \\"darkening effect\\" upon the series; he specifically cited the scene wherein Peppermint Butler demands Finn and Jake's flesh as payment.

He was born in Medina de Rio Seco into a family of artists of Flemish descent, probably from the town of 's-Hertogenbosch, dedicated to carving and assembly, and his brothers were also sculptors. He began his career heavily influenced by Juan de Juni, Gaspar Becerra and Esteban Jordan, who had worked in Medina de Rio Seco, so his work is considered a stylistic continuation of them. He moved to Cuellar in 1580, where he opened a workshop and married Ana Velazquez, with whom he had two children. In Cu√©llar, Pedro formed a very close professional relationship with the Maldonado Family (Julian and Gabriel), local painters who worked in much of the province of Segovia and the closest areas of Valladolid. He returned to Medina de Rio Seco where he died in 1595. His brothers and nephews continued the sculpting business. The sculptures thereafter were painted and decorated by the Maldonado family.

Barton was born in Oak Park, Illinois and grew up in Elmshurst, Illinois where he attended the public schools. During high school he suffered a leg injury and infection playing football, which led to his interest in becoming a physician. In school, he played the trombone and edited the year book. Barton attended college at the University of Illinois and upon graduation entered the University of Illinois College of Medicine. He earned his M.D. in 1931. He wrote his thesis on S. Weir Mitchell, a prominent neurologist and psychiatrist. He had planned to study obstetrics, but when he interned at the West Suburban Hospital in Oak Park, Illinois, he was persuaded to spend one year in psychiatry. He was recommended to practice at the Worcester State Mental Hospital in Massachusetts and he stayed there until 1942, first as a psychiatric resident then as assistant superintendent. The superintendent of the Worcester State Mental Hospital then was William Bryan, a physician who wrote the first book on psychiatric administration. Barton wrote his first publication in 1934 on pericardial hemorrhage in scurvy. Barton began his military career in 1937, when he joined the Army National Guard. He also began teaching at the Smith College School of Social Work. In 1938, he spent a year at the National Hospital, Queens Square in London to study neurology, and then returned to Worcester State Mental Hospital to train as an administrator under Bryan. In 1942, his National Guard unit was mobilized but he was declared essential medical personnel and stayed at the hospital. Later that year, he worked at the Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital in Washington, DC (now Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland) then assigned to the Valley Forge General Hospital in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, which was under construction. He complained about the construction of the psychiatric unit. His criticism of the rehabilitation activities in the U.S. Army led to his assignment in an occupational therapy unit of the Army and to develop rehabilitation programs for the blind and deaf. He also helped develop the Army's Reconditioning Program. His work in the army earned him the Legion of Merit Medal. Barton wanted an overseas assignment and was sent to Leyte in the Philippines as a commanding officer of a station medical hospital. In 1945, he was soon brought back at the request of the Governor of Massachusetts to be superintendent of the Boston State Hospital. He left military service as a lieutenant colonel. Barton found the Boston State Hospital in abominable conditions: there were only six physicians and 20 nurses to cover 2,600 patients. The buildings had been neglected and the patient care was inhumane. Barton's first task was to recruit physicians and nurses (his military experience enlarged his acquaintance with many qualified staff who he recruited for the hospital). He began training programs and research activities at the hospital. In 1946, Barton began his service as a consultant to the Veterans Administration (VA) and the National Institute of Mental Health. Both organizations were building their programs in training and research, and becoming active in psychiatric organizations. He was appointed to the Joint Commission on Mental Health and Illness which was established by the U.S. Congress to consider the entire field of mental health disease and to recommend improvements in medical care. He worked with the commission for six years which produced the book, Action for Mental Health, a blueprint for psychiatry for the future in the United States. Barton remained at the Boston State Hospital from 1945 to 1963, when he left to serve as Medical Director of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) from 1963 to 1974. He was elected President of the APA in 1961‚Äì1962. He was involved with many organizations: a director of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology from 1962 to 1970 (president, 1970); a member of the Residency Review Committee for Psychiatry and Neurology for the American Medical Association from 1966 to 1989, an Incorporator of the American College of Mental Health Administration in 1970, a member of the Massachusetts Council for Mental Health in 1929, a member of the Council of Medical Specialty Societies in 1929, and the Group for Advancement of Psychiatry (president, 1951). In 1958, Barton secured a grant from the Commonwealth Fund (Massachusetts) which enabled a small group to visit psychiatric facilities in Western Europe to study programs for chronic psychiatric patients. Barton published their findings in 1961 in Impressions of European Psychiatry. His career as a teacher began in 1931 as a lecturer to nurses, residents, and students at Worcester State Hospital. He taught at Clark University from 1940 to 1942, at Tufts Medical School between 1960 and 1963, Boston University School of Medicine between 1963 and 1989, and professor then professor emeritus at the Dartmouth Medical School from 1974 to 1989. Barton participated actively in many community organizations including the Occupational Therapy Association (president, 1951), the Board of Directors of The Associated Charities of Worcester, the Worcester Child Guidance Clinic, the YMCA of Worcester, the Board of Christian Social Concerns of the Methodist Church in Washington, DC, the American Mental Hygiene Society, and the Vermont State Mental Health Board from 1986 to 1987. He also received numerous honors: the Nolan D.C. Lewis Award in 1962, Salmon Medal of the New York Academy of Medicine in 1974, and an honorary D.Sc. from the University of Illinois Medical School. He was an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatry in London in 1972, a Fellow of the Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatry in 1970, an honorary member of the Eastern Psychiatric Association, an honorary member of the American Academy of Child Psychiatry, and a corresponding member Indian Psychiatric Society. His publications include fourteen books and approximately 200 journal articles. Barton died in Vermont in 1999.

Executed in 1621, the work is one of three busts of the subject created by Bernini‚Äîthe other two were bronze casts. The marble bust is on permanent display at the Art Gallery of Ontario. It was donated to the museum by Joey and Toby Tanenbaum. Background Bernini began work on the marble bust immediately after the election of Pope Gregory XV in February 1621, and completed the work in September of that year.Avery 1997, p. 39. Two bronze casts were also made during this time. He was able to achieve this by reusing the pattern and arrangement of the cope, amice, and alb he had created for the Bust of Pope Paul V in 1618. For this work, he made only a few minor changes to the flanking images of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, and modified the details of the morse or clasp of the cope. As a result, the sculpted busts of the two pontiffs closely resemble each other. In both, Bernini nestled the head low into the cope collar creating a triangular silhouette. Bernini was well rewarded for his efforts in creating the Bust of Pope Gregory XV. On 30 June 1621,Mormando 2011, p. 63. at the age of twenty-two, Bernini was awarded a papal knighthood by the pope‚Äîthe Supreme Order of Christ‚Äîand an accompanying lifetime salary. In 1622, Ottavio Leoni's engraving of the sculptor's portrait was published showing him wearing the special cross of the order. Thereafter, Bernini was commonly referred to as Il Cavaliere (the Knight). Bernini was also honoured at this time by being elected the principal of the Accademia di San Luca, the artists' society in Rome, after being a member for only three years. Along with the great mythological statues he executed in the Villa Borghese, these honours marked the summation of his early success. Description The Bust of Pope Gregory XV depicts a sickly, though mentally alert, sixty-seven-year-old man presented in the majestic role of pope, the head of the Catholic Church and a powerful force in international affairs. Bernini used the cope‚Äîwith its gold threads, stiff formal embroidery, and jewelled morse‚Äîto convey the power and wealth of the Church. The flanking panels depicting Saint Peter and Saint Paul show the pope's saintly protectors and reinforce the office of the sitter. Bernini shows the thickness of the fabric and the rigidity of the embroidery by the \\"abrupt bends with which it conforms to the curve of the pope's shoulders\\".Avery 1997, p. 40. The pope's head is bowed as if weighed down by his cope, symbolic of the weight and responsibility of his office, and perhaps his age. His eyes are raised, creating soft wrinkles across his forehead; his gaze is steady and far- reaching, focused beyond the viewer toward eternity. The pope's skin is smooth and polished, reflecting the natural pallor of the man's complexion as observed by his contemporaries. The smoothness of his skin is offset by the \\"crisp, dry carving of the myriad tufts of hair\\" around his tonsured head and along his cheeks and jowls. Bernini converges these lines at the pope's curly mustache and beard, which seem to \\"burst forth almost luxuriantly\\" in light and shade and depth‚Äîall created by Bernini's favorite sculpting tool, the drill. Technique Bernini's approach to portraiture was unique in several respects. Unlike other artists of his time that relied primarily on subject sittings‚Äîan approach that often produced stiff and overly-formal results‚ÄîBernini preferred to observe his subjects in their daily work and activities over a period of time, making numerous sketches that captured their features, characteristic poses, and natural expressions. He used these sketches to build preliminary models using moist clay. Using those models, Bernini would then begin the marble portrait of the subject. It was only toward the end of this process of carving the marble portrait that he would bring in the subject for formal sittings. This approach also accommodated the time constraints of his preoccupied clientele. Bernini's approach to working with white marble was also innovative. He once observed that the very material itself produces a pallor that distorts the natural visage, similar to the effect of a person fainting. Bernini's technique of offsetting this pallor was to produce \\"effects of colour\\" using numerous tricks, exaggerations, and distortions, such as drilling more deeply in certain places to create \\"accents of shadows\\" and presenting the figure in such a way as to catch the light. This approach is evident in his Bust of Pope Gregory XV, with his creation of shadows around the eyes, the sinuses, the wrinkles at the corners of the eyes, and even the pupils themselves. Bernini once noted, \\"Mere resemblance is not sufficient. One must express what goes on in the heads of heroes.\\" No doubt the artist viewed his subject, the leader of the Catholic Church, as an heroic figure. The result of Bernini's efforts was impressive, as one writer observed: Bronze models Bust of Pope Gregory XV (bronze), Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA While he worked on the marble bust, Bernini also created two identical bronze casts of the bust. These are currently on display in the Mus√©e Jacquemart-Andr√© in Paris, France, and in the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. It is generally believed that the two bronze busts were created as replicas, but recent studies seem to show that the bronze bust in Paris was a first specimen, chiselled by Bernini, and destined for a leading Roman collector. Provenance The bust was only rediscovered as an authentic work by Bernini in the 1980s. It had been in the hands of an English nobleman, and then an antiques dealer, before being recognised as a Bernini by Nicholas Meinertzhagen, a dealer in antiquarian books. Meinertzhagen, who had purchased the bust around 1978 for ¬£240, managed to sell it on at a price of ¬£132,000. The next buyer, Norman Leitman, managed to achieve a much higher price when he sold it via the auctioneers Sotheby's to Canadian collectors Joey and Toby Tanenbaum in 1983 for ¬£2.78 million‚Äîthe price had risen dramatically after art historian Irving Lavin had commented that \\"In my opinion the bust is not only the original, it is wholly autograph (i.e. by the master's own hand) and one of the most perfect and important of Bernini's early works.\\" The Tanenbaums then donated the piece to the Art Gallery of Ontario; however, the circumstances of the donation are not entirely clear. The Tanenbaums had tried to sell the piece at a 1990 Christie's auction for more than US$7 million‚Äîwhile bids at the auction reached US$6 million, the auction failed to reach the expected target and the bust was withdrawn from that sale.Daily Gazette, Jan 11 1990. https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JHkhAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=iokFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=3746%2C2185882 References ;Notes ;Bibliography  * * External links * Art Gallery of Toronto * Carnegie Museum of Art * Mus√©e Jacquemart-Andr√© Category:1620s sculptures Category:Busts in Canada Category:Collections of the Art Gallery of Ontario Category:Marble sculptures in Canada Category:Pope Gregory XV Category:Busts by Gian Lorenzo Bernini Category:Sculptures of popes ","title":"Bust of Pope Gregory XV"},{"id":"40169791","text":"SightLife is an eye bank, a non-profit organization that obtains, medically evaluates and distributes corneas donated by individuals for use in corneal transplantation, research, and education.

The species was a small to medium-sized, lightly built, ground-dwelling, bipedal carnivore, that could grow up to long. It was formerly called Syntarsus, but that name was already taken by a beetle, and was subsequently given the name Megapnosaurus by Ivie, ≈ölipi≈Ñski & Wƒôgrzynowicz, in 2001, though many subsequent studies have classified it in the genus Coelophysis. Description Coelophysis rhodesiensis measured up to 3 meters (10 ft) long from nose to tail and weighed about 32 kilograms (70 lb). The bones of 30 C. rhodesiensis individuals were found together in a fossil bed in Zimbabwe, so paleontologists think it may have hunted in packs. The various fossils attributed to this species have been dated over a relatively large time span ‚Äì the Hettangian, Sinemurian, and Pliensbachian stages of the Early Jurassic ‚Äì meaning the fossils represent either a highly successful genus or a few closely related animals all currently assigned to Coelophysis. Specimen UCMP V128659 was discovered in 1982 and referred to Megapnosaurus kayentakatae by Rowe (1989), as a subadult gracile individual and later, Tykoski (2005)Tykoski, 1998.

The taxon \\"Podokesauridae\\", was abandoned since its type specimen was destroyed in a fire and can no longer be compared to new finds. Over the years paleontologists assigned this genus to Ceratosauridae (Welles, 1984), Procompsognathidae (Parrish and Carpenter, 1986) and Ceratosauria (Gauthier, 1986). Most recently, it has been assigned to Coelophysidae by Tykoski and Rowe (2004), Ezcurra and Novas (2007) and Ezcurra (2007), which is the current scientific consensus.Tykoski, R. S. and Rowe, T., 2004, Ceratosauria, Chapter Three: In: The Dinosauria, Second Edition, edited by Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., and Osmolska, H., California University Press, p. 47-70. According to Tykoski and Rowe (2004) Coelophysis rhodesiensis can be distinguished based on the following characteristics: it differs from Coelophysis bauri in the pit at the base of the nasal process of the premaxilla; it differs from C.? kayentakatae because the promaxillary fenestra is absent and the nasal crests are absent; the frontal bones on the skull are not separated by a midline anterior extension of the parietal bones; the anterior astragalar surface is flat; metacarpal I has a reduced distal medial condyle (noted by Ezcurra, 2006); the anterior margin of antorbital fossa is blunt and squared (noted by Carrano et al., 2012); the base of lacrimal vertical ramus width is less than 30% its height (noted by Carrano et al., 2012); the maxillary and dentary tooth rows end posteriorly at the anterior rim of the lacrimal bone (noted by Carrano et al., 2012) Marsh and Rowe (2020) retain the generic name Syntarsus for both QG 1 and MNA V2623, and the respective specimens assigned to these taxa, as opposed to Coelophysis or Megapnosaurus, due to systematic relationships within Coelophysoidea in flux. As such, congenericity or the need for Megapnosaurus would not be supported if Coelophysis bauri, Syntarsus rhodesiensis, and Syntarsus kayentakatae do not form respective clades, as evidenced by their phylogenetic analyses. Paleoecology =Provenance and occurrence= The holotype of C. rhodesiensis (QG1) has been recovered in Upper Elliot Formation in South Africa, as well as the Chitake River bonebed quarry at the Forest Sandstone Formation in Rhodesia (now known as Zimbabwe). In South Africa, several individuals were collected in 1985 from mudstone deposited during the Hettangian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 201 to 199 million years ago. In Zimbabwe, twenty-six individuals were collected in 1963, 1968 and 1972 from yellow sandstone deposited during the Hettangian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 201 to 199 million years ago.M. A. Raath, 1969. A new coelurosaurian dinosaur from the Forest Sandstone of Rhodesia. Arnoldia (Rhodesia) 4(28):1-254M. A. Raath, 1977. The Anatomy of the Triassic Theropod Syntarsus rhodesiensis (Saurischia: Podokesauridae) and a Consideration of Its Biology. Department of Zoology and Entomology, Rhodes University, Salisbury, Rhodesia 1-233 =Fauna and habitat= The Upper Elliot Formation is thought to have been an ancient floodplain. Fossils of the prosauropod dinosaur Massospondylus and Ignavusaurus have been recovered from the Upper Elliot Formation, which boasts the world's most diverse fauna of early Jurassic ornithischian dinosaurs, including Abrictosaurus, Fabrosaurus, Heterodontosaurus, and Lesothosaurus, among others. The Forest Sandstone Formation was the paleoenvironment of protosuchid crocodiles, sphenodonts, the dinosaur Massospondylus and indeterminate remains of a prosauropod. Paul (1988) noted that Megapnosaurus rhodesiensis lived among desert dunes and oases and hunted juvenile and adult prosauropods.Paul, G. S., 1988, Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, a complete Illustrated guide: New York Academy of sciences book, 464pp. Paleobiology = Appearance = C. rhodesiensis was a lean, elongated species of theropod dinosaur with an S shaped neck, long hind limbs that resembled the legs of large birds such as the Secretarybird, shorter forelimbs with four digits on each hand unlike most later theropods, and a long tail. While still lean, it sported a more robust frame than other Coelophysoidea members. Its extremely bird-like body lead to C. rhodesiensis being one of the first dinosaurs to be portrayed with feathers, though there is no direct evidence that it actually had feathers. =Growth= Age determination studies using growth ring counts suggest that the longevity of C. rhodesiensis was approximately seven years.Chinsamy, A., (1994). Dinosaur bone histology: Implications and inferences. In Dino Fest (G. D. Rosenburg and D. L. Wolberg, Eds.), pp. 213-227. The Paleontological Society, Department of Geological Sciences, Univ. of Tennessee, Knoxville. Recent research has found that C. rhodesiensis had highly variable growth between individuals, with some specimens being larger in their immature phase than smaller adults were when completely mature; this indicates that the supposed presence of distinct morphs is simply the result of individual variation. This highly variable growth was likely ancestral to dinosaurs but later lost, and may have given such early dinosaurs an evolutionary advantage in surviving harsh environmental challenges. =Feeding and diet= The supposed \\"weak joint\\" in the jaw, led to the early hypothesis that dinosaurs such as these were scavengers, as the front teeth and bone structure of the jaw were thought to be too weak to take down and hold struggling prey. C. rhodesiensis was one of the first dinosaurs to be portrayed with feathers, though there is no direct evidence that it actually had feathers. Paul (1988) noted that this genus, which may have hunted in packs, preyed upon prosauropods and early lizards. Comparisons between the scleral rings of C. rhodesiensis and modern birds and reptiles indicate that it may have been nocturnal. =Paleopathology= In C. rhodesiensis, healed fractures of the tibia and metatarsus have been observed, but are very rare. \\"[T]he supporting butresses of the second sacral rib\\" in one specimen of Syntarsus rhodesiensis showed signs of fluctuating asymmetry. Fluctuating asymmetry results from developmental disturbances and is more common in populations under stress and can therefore be informative about the quality of conditions a dinosaur lived under.Molnar, R. E., 2001, Theropod paleopathology: a literature survey: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, p. 337-363. Ichnology Dinosaur footprints that were later attributed to C. rhodesiensis were discovered in Rhodesia in 1915. These tracks were discovered at the Nyamandhlovu Sandstones Formation, in eolian red sandstone that was deposited in the Late Triassic, approximately 235 to 201 million years ago.

When the Republic of Councils in Hungary was established in 1919, it controlled approximately 23% of the territory of Hungary's classic pre-World War I territories (325 411 km2). It was the successor of the first Hungarian People's Republic and lasted from only 21 March to 1 August 1919. Though the de jure leader of the Hungarian Soviet Republic was president S√°ndor Garbai, the de facto power was in the hands of foreign minister B√©la Kun, who maintained direct contact with Lenin via radiotelegraph. It was Lenin who gave the direct orders and advice to B√©la Kun via constant radio communication with the Kremlin. It was the second socialist state in the world to be formed, preceded by only the October Revolution in Russia which brought the Bolsheviks to power. The Hungarian Republic of Councils had military conflicts with the Kingdom of Romania, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and the evolving Czechoslovakia. It ended on 1 August 1919 when Hungarians sent representatives to negotiate their surrender to the Romanian forces. Due to the mistranslation, it is often referred to as \\"Hungarian Soviet republic\\" in English sources, despite the literal name being \\"Republic of Councils in Hungary\\" to avoid any strong ethnic connotation with Hungarian people.  Formation  As the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy collapsed in 1918, an independent Hungarian People's Republic was formed after the Aster Revolution. The official proclamation of the republic was on 16 November 1918 and Count Mih√°ly K√°rolyi became its president. K√°rolyi struggled to establish the government's authority and to control the country. During the rule of K√°rolyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost the control over approx. 75% of its former pre-WW1 territories (325 411 km2) without armed resistance and was subject to foreign occupation. left An initial nucleus of a Hungarian Communist Party had been organized in a hotel on 4 November 1918, when a group of Hungarian prisoners of war and other communist proponents formed a Central Committee in Moscow. Led by B√©la Kun, the inner circle of the freshly established party returned to Budapest from Moscow on 16 November 1918. On 24 November they created the Party of Communists from Hungary (Hungarian: Kommunist√°k Magyarorsz√°gi P√°rtja). The name was chosen instead of \\"The Hungarian Communist Party\\" because the vast majority of supporters were from the urban industrial working class in Hungary which at the time was largely made up of people from non-Hungarian ethnic backgrounds, with ethnic Hungarians a minority in the new party itself.E. Raffay, Trianon Titkai (Secrets of Trianon), Szikra Press, Budapest 1990 (), page 13. The party recruited members while propagating its ideas, radicalising many members of the Social Democratic Party of Hungary in the process. By February 1919, the party numbered 30,000 to 40,000 members, including many unemployed ex- soldiers, young intellectuals and ethnic minorities.The Library of Congress Country Studies ‚Äì Hungarian Soviet Republic Kun founded a newspaper, called V√∂r√∂s √öjs√°g (\\"Red News\\") and concentrated on attacking K√°rolyi's liberal government. The party became popular among the Budapest proletariat, it also promised that Hungary would be able to defend its territory even without conscription. Kun promised military help and intervention of the Soviet Red Army, which never came, against non-communist Romanian, Czechoslovak, French and Yugoslav forces. During the following months, the Communist Party's power- base rapidly expanded. Its supporters began to stage aggressive demonstrations against the media and against the Social Democratic Party. The Communists considered the Social Democrats as their main rivals, because the Social Democrats recruited their political supporters from the same social class: the industrial working class of the cities. In one crucial incident, a demonstration turned violent on 20 February and the protesters attacked the editorial office of the Social Democratic Party of Hungary' official paper, N√©pszava (People's Word). In the ensuing chaos, seven people, some policemen, were killed. The government arrested the leaders of the Communist Party, banned V√∂r√∂s √öjs√°g and closed down the party's buildings. The arrests were particularly violent, with police officers openly beating the communists. This resulted in a wave of public sympathy for the party among the masses of Budapester proletariat. On 1 March, V√∂r√∂s √öjs√°g was given permission to publish again, and the Communist Party's premises were re-opened. The leaders were permitted to receive guests in prison, which allowed them to keep up with political affairs. Coup d'√©tat left On 20 March, president Mih√°ly K√°rolyi announced that the D√©nes Berinkey government would resign. The Berinkey government had been placed in an impossible position when it received a note from Paris ordering Hungarian troops to withdraw further their lines. It was widely assumed that the new military lines would be the postwar boundaries. K√°rolyi and Berinkley concluded that while accepting the note would endanger Hungary's territorial integrity, they were not in a position to reject it either. On 21 March, K√°rolyi informed the Council of Ministers that only Social Democrats could form a new government, as they were the party with the highest public support in the largest cities and especially in Budapest. In order to form a governing coalition, Social Democrats started secret negotiations with the Communist leaders ‚Äì who were still imprisoned ‚Äì and decided to merge their two parties under the name of the Hungarian Socialist Party.Borsanyi, Gyorgy, The life of a Communist revolutionary, Bela Kun, translated by Mario Fenyo; Social Science Monographs, Boulder, Colorado; Columbia University Press, New York, 1993, p178. President K√°rolyi, who was an outspoken anti-Communist, was not informed about the fusion of the Communist and Social Democrat parties. Thus, while believing that he had appointed a Social Democratic government, he found himself faced with one dominated by Communists. Mih√°ly K√°rolyi resigned on 21 March. B√©la Kun and his communist friends were released from the Margit Ring prison on the night of 20 March 1919. For the Social Democrats, an alliance with the KMP not only increased their standing with the industrial working class, but also gave them a potential link to the increasingly powerful Russian Communist Party, as Kun had strong ties with prominent Russian Bolsheviks. Following Lenin's model, but without the direct participation of the workers' councils (soviets) from which it took its name, the newly united Socialist Party created a government called the Revolutionary Governing Council, which proclaimed the Hungarian Soviet Republic and dismissed President K√°rolyi on 21 March. The liberal president K√°rolyi was arrested by the new Communist government on the first day; in July 1919 he managed to make his escape and flee to Paris. On 23 March, Lenin gave an order to B√©la Kun that Social Democrats must be removed from power, so that Hungary could be transformed into a true communist state ruled by a \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\". Accordingly, the Communists started to purge the Social Democrats from the government on the next day. =The Garbai Government= The government of the Hungarian Soviet republic: S√°ndor Garbai, B√©la Kun, Vilmos B√∂hm, Tibor Szamuely, Gy√∂rgy Nyisztor, Jen≈ë Varga, Zsigmond Kunfi, Dezs≈ë Bok√°nyi, J√≥zsef Pog√°ny, B√©la V√°g√≥, Zolt√°n R√≥nai, K√°roly Vantus, Jen≈ë Landler, B√©la Sz√°nt√≥, S√°ndor Szabados, Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs, Jen≈ë Hamburger, Gyula Hevesi, Antal Dovcs√°k, and Gyula Lengyel. In a radio dispatch to the Russian SFSR, Kun informed Lenin that a \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\" had been established in Hungary and asked for a treaty of alliance with the Russian SFSR. The Russian SFSR refused because it was itself tied down in the Russian Civil War. The government was formally led by S√°ndor Garbai, but Kun, as Commissar of Foreign Affairs, held the real power, because only Kun had the acquaintance and friendship with Lenin. (He was the only person in the government who met and talked to Lenin during the Russian Revolution) and Kun kept the contact with the Kremlin via radio communication. The ministries often rotated among the various members of the government. *S√°ndor Garbai president and prime minister of the Hungarian Soviet republic *Jen≈ë Landler commissar for interior *S√°ndor Csizmadia, K√°roly V√°ntus, Jen≈ë Hamburger, Gy√∂rgy Nyisztor ‚Äì commissars of agriculture *J√≥zsef Pogany, later also B√©la Sz√°nt√≥ ‚Äì commissars of Defense *Zolt√°n R√≥nai, later also Istv√°n L√°day ‚Äì commissars of Justice *Jen≈ë Landler ‚Äì commissar for trade *M√≥r Erd√©lyi, later also Bern√°t Kondor ‚Äì commissars about food *Zsigmond Kunfi, later also Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs, Tibor Szamuely, S√°ndor Szabados ‚Äì commissars about education *B√©la Kun ‚Äì commissar for foreign affairs *Dezs≈ë Bok√°nyi ‚Äì commissar of labor *Henrik Kalm√°r ‚Äì commissar for German affairs *Jen≈ë Varga, later also Gyula Lengyel ‚Äì commissars of Finance *Vilmos B√∂hm ‚Äì commissar for socialism, later also Antal Dovcs√°k After the declaration of the constitution changes took place in the commissariat.

Under the rule of Kun, the new government, which had adopted in full the program of the Communists, decreed the abolition of aristocratic titles and privileges; the separation of church and state; codified freedom of speech and assembly; and implemented free education and language and cultural rights to minorities. The Communist government also nationalized industrial and commercial enterprises and socialized housing, transport, banking, medicine, cultural institutions, and all landholdings of more than 40 hectares. Public support for Communists was also heavily dependent on their promise of restoring Hungary's former borders. The government took steps toward normalizing foreign relations with the Triple Entente powers in an effort to gain back some of the lands that Hungary was set to lose in the post-war negotiations. The Communists remained bitterly unpopular in the Hungarian countryside, where the authority of that government was often nonexistent. The communist party and communist policies had real popular support among only the proletarian masses of large industrial centers ‚Äì especially in Budapest ‚Äì where the working class represented a high proportion of the inhabitants. The Hungarian government was thus left on its own, and a Red Guard was established under the command of M√°ty√°s R√°kosi. B√©la Kun, de facto leader of the Soviet Republic in Hungary In addition, a group of 200 armed men ‚Äì known as the Lenin Boys ‚Äì formed a mobile detachment under the leadership of J√≥zsef Cserny. This detachment was deployed at various locations around the country where counter-revolutionary movements were suspected to operate. The Lenin Boys, as well as other similar groups and agitators, killed and terrorised many people (e.g. armed with hand grenades and using their rifles' butts they disbanded religious ceremonies). They executed victims without trial.See resources in the article Red Terror. This caused a number of conflicts with the local population, some of which turned violent. The situation of the Hungarian Communists began to deteriorate in the capital city Budapest after a failed coup by the Social Democrats on 24 June, the newly composed Communist government of S√°ndor Garbai resorted to large-scale reprisals. Revolutionary tribunals ordered executions of people who were suspected of having been involved in the attempted coup. This became known as the \\"Red Terror\\", and greatly reduced domestic support for the government even among the working classes of the highly industrialized suburb districts and metropolitan area of Budapest. Foreign policy scandal and downfall  Mass celebration of the Hungarian Red Army's march to Kassa (Ko≈°ice) during the Hungarian‚ÄìCzechoslovak War Leaders of the Hungarian Soviet Republic: Tibor Szamuely, B√©la Kun, Jen≈ë Landler (left to right). The monument is now located at the Memento Park open-air museum outside Budapest. In late May, after the Entente military representative demanded more territorial concessions from Hungary, Kun attempted to \\"fulfill\\" his promise to adhere to Hungary's historical borders. The men of the Hungarian Red Army were recruited from the volunteers of the Budapest proletariat. In June, the Hungarian Red Army invaded the eastern part of the newly forming Czechoslovak state (today's Slovakia), the former so-called \\"Upper Hungary\\". The Hungarian Red Army achieved some military success early on: under the leadership of Colonel Aur√©l Stromfeld, it ousted Czech troops from the north, and planned to march against the Romanian army in the east. Despite promises for the restoration of the former borders of Hungary, the communists declared the establishment of the Slovak Soviet Republic in Pre≈°ov on 16 June 1919. After the proclamation of the Slovak Soviet Republic, the Hungarian nationalists and patriots soon realized that the new communist government had no intentions to recapture the lost territories, only to spread communist ideology and establish other communist states in Europe, thus sacrificing Hungarian national interests. The Hungarian patriots in the Red Army and the professional military officers saw this as a betrayal, and their support for the government began to erode (the communists and their government supported the establishment of the Slovak Communist state, while the Hungarian patriots wanted to keep the reoccupied territories for Hungary). Despite a series of military victories against the Czechoslovak army, the Hungarian Red Army started to disintegrate due to tension between nationalists and communists during the establishment of the Slovak Soviet Republic. The concession eroded support of the communist government among professional military officers and nationalists in the Hungarian Red Army; even the chief of the general staff Aur√©l Stromfeld, resigned his post in protest. When the French promised the Hungarian government that Romanian forces would withdraw from the Tisz√°nt√∫l, Kun withdrew his remaining military units who had remained loyal after the political fiasco in Upper Hungary. However, following the Red Army's retreat from the north, the Romanian forces were not pulled back. Kun then unsuccessfully tried to turn the remaining units of the demoralized Hungarian Red Army on the Romanians. The Hungarian Soviet found it increasingly difficult to fight Romania with its small force of communist volunteers from Budapest, and support for both the war and the Communist Party was waning at home. After the demoralizing retreat from \\"Northern Hungary\\" (later part of Czechoslovakia), only the most dedicated Hungarian Communists volunteered for combat, and the Romanian army broke through the weak lines of the Hungarian Red Army on 30 July. J√≥zsef Pog√°ny (\\"John Pepper\\") speaking to communist soldiers B√©la Kun, together with other high-ranking Communists, fled to Vienna on 1 August with only a minority, including Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs, the former Commissar for Culture and noted Marxist philosopher, remaining to organise an underground Communist Party.Borsanyi, Gyorgy, The life of a Communist revolutionary, Bela Kun, translated by Mario Fenyo; Social Science Monographs, Boulder, Colorado; Columbia University Press, New York, 1993, p205. The Budapest Workers' Soviet elected a new government, headed by Gyula Peidl, which lasted only a few days before Romanian forces entered Budapest on 6 August.Ign√°c Romsics: Magyarorsz√°g t√∂rt√©nete a XX. sz√°zadban, 2004, p. 134. In the power vacuum created by the fall of the Soviet Republic and the presence of the Romanian Army, semi-regular detachments (technically under Horthy's command, but mostly independent in practice) initiated a campaign of violence against Communists, leftists, and Jews, known as the White Terror. Many supporters of the Hungarian Soviet Republic were executed without trial; others, including P√©ter √Ågoston, Ferenc Baj√°ki, Dezs≈ë Bok√°nyi, Antal Dovcs√°k, J√≥zsef Haubrich, Kalm√°r Henrik, Kelen J√≥zsef, Gy√∂rgy Nyisztor, S√°ndor Szabados, and K√°roly V√°ntus, were imprisoned by trial (\\"comissar suits\\").

She showed useful form in the early part of her career but developed into a top-class runner in the second half of her three-year-old season, winning the Sun Chariot Stakes and Champion Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in October 1983. Her four-year-old season was curtailed by injury, but she became the first filly to win the Lockinge Stakes and produced her best performance in her final race when she won the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup at York Racecourse. At the end of the year she was the highest-rated female racehorse trained in Europe. Cormorant Wood was retired to stud where she had some success as a producer of winners. Background Cormorant Wood was a big, rangy, dark bay mare with a white star and snip bred by her owner Robert McAlpine. She was sired by Home Guard, a horse who showed his best form over sprint distances, winning the Hungerford Stakes and the Diadem Stakes in 1972. Her dam, Quarry Wood was a long-distance handicapper who won four races and finished fifth in the Chester Cup. Her previous foals had made no impact, but she went on to produce River Ceiriog, who won the Supreme Novices' Hurdle at the 1986 Cheltenham Festival. The filly was trained by Barry Hills at his South Bank stable at Lambourn in Berkshire and was ridden to her biggest wins by the American jockey Steve Cauthen. Racing career =1982: two-year-old season= Cormorent Wood ran twice as a two-year-old, finishing unplaced in a six furlong maiden race and then winning a similar event over a furlong further. =1983: three-year-old season= In the early part of 1983, Cormorant Wood was campaigned over one and a half miles with the Oaks Stakes as her main target. She prepared for the race with a run in the Group Three Oaks Trial Stakes at Lingfield Park Racecourse in May and showed promise in finishing second, five lengths behind the leading Irish filly Give Thanks. At Epsom Downs Racecourse on 4 June Cormorant Wood was ridden by Lester Piggott and started at odds of 11/1 in the Oaks. She raced in second place for most of the distance, but weakened in the last quarter mile to finish sixth of the fifteen runners behind Sun Princess. In July she was matched against colts and older horses for the first time in the Group Two Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. As at Epsom, she raced prominently before tiring in the closing stages and finishing seventh behind the Irish colt Quilted. For her next three races, Cormorant Wood was brought back in distance to ten furlongs and showed improved form. In the Virginia Stakes, a new race run at Newcastle Racecourse in August she recorded her first success of the year when beating Air Distingue, a filly who had finished third in the Prix de Diane. In early October at Newmarket she was ridden by Steve Cauthen in the Sun Chariot Stakes and won her first Group race, beating Sedra by a length at odds of 7/2. Two weeks later, over the same course and distance she started at odds of 18/1 in a field of nineteen runners for the Champion Stakes. Her opponents included the Group One winners Wassl (Irish 2,000 Guineas), Tolomeo (Arlington Million) and Be My Native (Coronation Cup). In a race run in a gale force side wind, Cauthen restrained the filly in the early stages and she was still in last place with three furlongs to run. She then produced a burst of acceleration which, according to Timeform, \\"had to be seen to be believed\\", overtaking the entire field and winning by a head from Tolomeo, with Flame of Tara a short head away in third. Many of the jockeys struggled to keep their mounts running straight in the conditions and Tolomeo was subsequently disqualified for causing interference. Cauthen's performance was highly praised, with the BBC's Jimmy Lindley commenting on the American's \\"anticipation, coolness and quick thinking\\". On her final appearance of the season, Cormorant Wood was again tried over one and a half miles when she was sent to the United States to contest the Washington, D.C. International Stakes. Once again, she failed to stay the distance, finishing fifth of the eight runners behind All Along. =1984: four-year-old season= Cormorant Wood was brought back to one mile for her four-year-old debut for the Lockinge Stakes (then a Group Three) race at Newbury Racecourse in May. She overtook Wassl inside the final furlong, but the colt rallied in the final strides to force a dead heat. She attempted one mile again at Royal Ascot in June when she contested the Queen Anne Stakes, which was then a Group Two race open to horses aged three and older. She finished third behind the three-year-old colt Trojan Fen. In July she returned to her best distance of one and quarter miles and attempted to become the first female to win the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse. She finished sixth behind the Irish-trained colt Sadler's Wells. In August, Cormorant Wood and Sadler's Wells met again in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup at York Racecourse where her other opponent included Tolomeo and the leading British miler Chief Singer. Starting as a 15/1 outsider, the filly was held up by Cauthen towards the back of the field before moving forward in the straight. She took the lead a furlong from the finish and went clear of the field to win by two and a half lengths from Tolomeo, with Chief Singer and Sadler's Wells in third and fourth. On the day following her victory, Cormorant Wood's leg was found to be badly swollen. Examinations revealed a serious tendon injury which ended her racing career. Assessment The independent Timeform organisation gave Cormorant Wood a rating of 125 as a three-year-old in 1983. The official International Classification rated her on 83, making her the fifth-best three-year old filly in Europe behind Habibti, Sun Princess, Luth Enchantee and Sharaya. In the following year she was awarded a rating of 130 by Timeform, whilst the International Classification rated her on 88, making her the highest-rated female racehorse of the year ahead of Time Charter, All Along and Northern Trick. In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Cormorant Wood the sixteenth best British or Irish filly of the 20th century. Stud record Cormorant Wood was retired from racing to become a broodmare. By far the best of her offspring was Rock Hopper, a colt sired by Shareef Dancer, who raced in the colours of Maktoum Al Maktoum: in a four-year racing career he won nine races including the Hardwicke Stakes (twice), Yorkshire Cup, Princess of Wales's Stakes and Jockey Club Stakes. Her other good winner was Cliveden Gail, an Irish-trained mare who was successful in long-distance handicaps including the Irish Cesarewitch and the Leopardstown November Handicap.

Tompkins was born in Chicago into a working-class family. His early education was at Holy Cross School and St. Cyril's College in Chicago. He received his B.S. in 1927 and then his M.D. in 1932 from Loyola University Chicago, School of Medicine. He interned at Mercy Hospital in Chicago. His residency in obstetrics and in pediatrics was completed at Lewis Memorial Maternity Hospital in Chicago and the Chicago Municipal Contagious Disease Hospital. In 1934, he entered the U.S. Army as a first lieutenant and assigned to the Civilian Conservation Corps. He served in the Army for 31 years, retiring as a Colonel. In 1935, Tompkins entered his psychiatric residency at the Veterans Administration (VA) Mental Hospital in Little Rock, Arkansas. Through the VA, he traveled to numerous VA mental hospitals: Danville, Illinois, St. Cloud, Minnesota, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Mendota, Wisconsin. In 1945, as World War II ended, the VA medical service was reorganized and a Division of Psychiatry and Neurology was established. Daniel Blain, M.D, was the director of the new division and he selected Tompkins to be his assistant. Two years later, Blain resigned and Tompkins took his place as Director of the Division of Psychiatry and Neurology. He remained the director until 1955 when he resigned from the VA to accept a position at the St. Vincent's Catholic Medical Center in New York. St. Vincent's was a long-established 600 bed general hospital and there were plans to expand the hospital to 1,000 beds and to include psychiatric services. Tompkins served as a consultant during the planning and construction and upon completion; he headed the new psychiatric service until 1973 when he retired. Under Tompkins's tenure, the psychiatric service grew from eight attending physicians and psychiatric residents to 50 attendings and 28 residents. Training programs were introduced in the areas of psychology, social work, and occupational therapy. St. Vincent's was under the authority of the Catholic Diocese and Tompkins became the coordinator of all psychiatric Catholic sponsored health facilities in the New York area. Tompkins was a member of numerous medical and psychiatric organizations: the National Academy of Religion and Psychiatry (president, 1957‚Äì1958), the New York City Community Mental Health Board, the Chairman of the Advisory Committee of the National Association of Mental Health, the American College of Physicians, the Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry, the American Academy of Neurology, the American Psychiatric Association, (president 1966‚Äì1967), a Trustee at the New York School of Psychiatry, Associate Secretary of the World Psychiatric Association, and a corresponding member of the Royal Medico-Psychological Association. He was a professor of clinical psychiatry at Georgetown University Medical School and at the New York University School of Medicine. In 1965, he delivered the Maudsley Bequest Lecture at a joint meeting of the American Psychiatric Association and the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Harvey died in New York in 1983.

Assadourian outlines four policies overdeveloped nations could employ to sufficiently facilitate a planned and controlled contraction of the economy so as to get back in line with planetary boundaries. Each of these, in unison, will eventually foster the creation of a steady-state economy that is in balance with Earth‚Äôs limits: * Reduce overall consumption by overconsumers * Distribute tax burdens more equitably * Share work hours better * Cultivate a plenitude economy: ‚Äúinformalize‚Äù certain sectors of the economy Assadourian also wrote a 2-page policy briefhttp://www.worldwatch.org/system/files/SOW12%20Summary%20(Chapter%202).pdf on the chapter highlighting the key messages of, the problem regarding, and points to keep in mind moving forward on our path to degrowth.

Life John Smart was born at 13 Annandale StreetEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1838 off Leith Walk, the son of Emily Margaret Morton and Robert Campbell Smart (d.1871), an engraver operating from 20 Elm Row. He was educated at Leith High School, and then studied art at the School of Manufacturers, with the intention of becoming an engraver like his father. After showing talent for landscape painting, he instead became a pupil of Horatio McCulloch. He was one of the founder members of the Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour and he was elected to the Royal Scottish Academy in 1877 after first being elected an associate in 1871. Smart's paintings depicted scenery from across the lowlands and highlands of Scotland. The critic James Caw said of Smart's landscape paintings, \\"If coarse in handling and wanting in subtlety of feeling, they are simple and effective in design, vivid in effect and powerful in execution, and breathe an ardent passion for the landscape of his native land.\\" Both his house and studio were at 13 Brunswick Street in Edinburgh's east end.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1889-90 The distinctive terraced townhouse was designed by William Henry Playfair in 1824.Buildings of Scotland; Edinburgh by Gifford, McWilliam and Walker He is buried with his wife, Agnes Purdie Main, in Warriston Cemetery on the north side of the central roundel.

Cyclopygids had an extratropical distribution, and there is evidence that they lived in darker parts of the water column (around 175m deep). Cyclopygids are characterized by enlarged eyes, with a wide angle of view, both horizontal and vertical, reminiscent of the eyes of dragonflies. These typically touch the glabella directly on the side. Cyclopygids all lack genal spines, but Symphysops carries a forward directed frontal spine on the glabella. It is presumed that at least the members of the genus Pricyclopyge swam upside down and had bioluminescent organs on the third thorax segment. Cyclopygids had between 7 and 5 thorax segments, a wide and stout axis, and short side lobes (or pleurae).  Taxonomy  Pricyclopyge binodosa, 24mm long, with two characteristic disc shaped hollows on the 3rd thorax segmentThe genera of Cyclopygidae are grouped into the following subfamilies: *Cyclopyginae ** Cyclopyge Hawle & Corda, 1847 ** Delgamella Marek, 1961 ** Gastropolus Whittard, 1966 ** Heterocyclopyge Marek, 1961 ** Microparia Hawle & Corda, 1847 ** Novakella Whittard, 1952? ** Prospectatrix Fortey, 1981 ** Sagavia Koroleva, 1967 *Ellipsotaphrinae ** EIlipsotaphrus Whittard, 1952 ** Psilacella Whittard, 1952 *Pricyclopyginae ** Pricyclopyge Richter & Richter, 1954 ** Circulocrania Fortey, 1987 ** Emmrichops Marek, 1961 ** Symphysops Raymond, 1925 *Assignment unclear ** Aspidaeglina Holub, 1911 ** Phylacops Cooper & Kindle, 1936 ** Xenocyclopyge Lu, 1962 *Genera previously assigned to Cyclopygidae ** Girvanopyge (Remopleurididae)  Extinction  The extinction ending the Ordovician was one of the most radical for life to have experienced, and the trilobites were heavily affected. Those with pelagic or deep water benthic life styles (such as species in Olenidae and Agnostida) died out. Also those trilobites having planktonic larvae became extinct, and these include most of the superfamilies in the order Asaphida, save for Trinucleoidea. A reduction in diversity already occurred before this major extinction, but many families persisted into the Hirnantian, and it is possible that they would quickly have been restored to their former diversity. The crisis that started the Silurian must have exceptionally severe, and was associated with low oxygen levels in the oceans after an ice age.Whittington, H. B. et al. Part O, Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology. Revised, Volume 1 ‚Äì Trilobita ‚Äì Introduction, Order Agnostida, Order Redlichiida. 1997  Description  Cyclopygids have particularly large eyes with a wide angle view, also vertically, that occupy most of the free cheeks, and the fixed cheeks absent or reduced to a very narrow strip at the sides of the glabella, and a zone between the both eyes. In the earliest cyclopygids (Prospectatrix) the eyes are less enlarged, but in some later taxa, eyes are so big they have even fused. The most backward lobe of the glabella (the occipital ring) cannot be identified, except in the Ellipsotaphrinae subfamily. Further furrows crossing the glabella may be absent or are reduced to pairs of slight depressions. Genal spines are lacking. Cyclopygids have between 5 and 7 thorax segments. The pleurae become successively wider further back, making the thorax widest across the last segment. = Eyes = fused eyes of a Symphysops sp., visual surface 30mm wide following the curve of the eyes, and 10 mm high, oblique view, collected near Zagora, Morocco In pelagic trilobites, such as the species in the proetid family Telephinidae, and in Cyclopygidae, as in many extant pelagic crustaceans, the eyes are particularly large and have very wide angles of view, both horizontal and vertical. This is in stark contrast to contemporary benthic trilobites, that may have an extensive horizontal angle of view, but always have a limited vertical angle of view. In a few species of the genera Cyclopyge, Microparia, Ellipsotaphrus, Pricyclopyge and in Symphysops the eyes are merged in front of the head creating a visor. This development improves the sensitivity of the eye for objects that move relative to the eye, which might have been particularly useful under low-light conditions and when rapidly moving. The extant hyperiid amphipod Cystisoma also has such fused eyes. Monocular trilobites are always younger than closely related species with normal paired eyes, and is an example of a trend that occurred several times in parallel. Only in Pricyclopyge binodosa several stages in this development can be seen as a consecutive series of subspecies collected from successive zones in the late Arenig to the Llanvirn. Although the distance between the eyes varies within any one population of the earlier subspecies, the eyes only touch and merge in P. binodosa synophthalma.  Ecology  Cyclopygids are absent from shallow water strata, such as alluvial and calcareous deposits. They are not found together with well-sighted benthic trilobite species or corals. They do occur with blind or nearly blind benthic trilobites, a typical adaptation to a lightless environment, and oceanic free- floating graptolites. Hence, cyclopygids are considered to have been confined to deeper water, swimming at the lower limit of the photic zone (or mesopelagic), but still high above the benthic species they were deposited with. This is also evidenced by the presumed present of bioluminescent organs on the third thorax segment of Pricyclopyge, which also occur on the functional underside of extant mesopelagic species. This is why it is assumed Pricyclopyge may have swum upside down. Very large, convex eyes and a narrow zone of thoracic pleurae are typical for all Cyclopygidae, and are indications of a pelagic lifestyle. The stout exoskeleton is consistent with rapid swimming and it is likely cyclopygids actively hunted zooplankton.

Actress Ilene Kristen originated and last played the role, that was created and introduced by Claire Labine and Paul Avila Mayer and first appeared in the pilot episode first broadcast July 7, 1975. Delia is the catalyst for many of the show's story lines and remains a central component of the series throughout its run. Delia is the kind of character that viewers \\"love to hate\\". Delia has a habit of dealing with situations in ways that cause even more trouble. Delia is known for her early chaotic romances with brothers, Patrick and Frank. Delia eventually finds true love with Dr. Roger Coleridge. Delia is considered to be the breakout character of the series and remains one of the most iconic characters in daytime history. In 2013, Kristen would reprise the role of Delia on the sole surviving ABC drama, General Hospital where she is revealed to be the mother of the treacherous Ava Jerome (Maura West). Us Weekly ranked the character as the number-one villainess in soaps in 1977. Creation =Casting= Ilene Kristen was one of the show's original cast members. However, Kristen vacated the role in late 1978, with her last appearance airing January 5, 1979. The producers immediately began searching for Kristen's replacement. In the meantime, Robyn Millan appeared in the role of Delia for five episodes from January 18 to February 21, 1979. Randall Edwards officially took over the role of Delia beginning on February 27, 1979. In late February 1982, it was reported that Edwards had been fired and Kristen returned to the role in early March. After failing to impress as One Life to Live's Georgina Whitman, Kristen was left unemployed allowing for her to return to Ryan's Hope. However, in 1983, Kristen was fired from the series when she was suffering from a thyroid illness. Robin Mattson known for her iconic role as Heather Webber on General Hospital was later cast in the role. Mattson made her debut on June 15, 1984. However, Mattson was only contracted to the role for six months. ABC hoped to talk Mattson into a long term commitment, but after failed contract negotiations, Mattson vacated the role in December 1984, just in time for pilot season. It was announced in August 1986 that Kristen would once again reprise the role of Delia. Kristen made her onscreen return on September 5, 1986. Kristen remained with the series until its final episode on January 13, 1989. In early October 2013, several reports surfaced and claimed that Kristen would reprise the role of Delia on the remaining ABC Daytime soap, General Hospital. However, the series never commented on the rumors. On Friday, October 25, Kristen appeared in the next episode preview. Ron Carlivati himself confirmed through Twitter that Kristen would reprise her role as Delia for two episodes on October 28 and 29. Kristen appeared on those episodes, revealing that her character, Delia, was the mother of Ava Jerome, the illegitimate daughter of Victor Jerome. In early January 2014, Kristen confirmed that she will once again appear on GH as Delia for four episodes on February 25 to 28, 2014. In May 2014, newcomer Michelle Stafford revealed that she had taped scenes opposite Kristen indicating that the actress would reprise her role of Delia. =Characterization= Upon the show's debut, The Robesonian described the character as \\"beautiful and sultry.\\" Though Delia can be a bit insensitive, no one hold more for Delia then Delia herself Kristen explained. Michael Denis said Kristen displayed a specific kind of \\"manic verve\\" as well as \\"troubled\\" and \\"erratic.\\" According to Denis, the character has two distinct sides to her personality, the \\"happy\\" youthful side which is usually betrayed by her \\"sick\\" side. Stephanie Schaefer described the character as \\"bewitching, \\"dizzy,\\" and \\"wacky. Francine L. Trevens described the character as a \\"conniving\\" whiner. Damon L. Jacobs said Delia displayed all the characteristics of Borderline Personality Disorder before it was first listed as a diagnosis in 1980. Kristen said for the character to be \\"real\\" she observed those that were extremely needy. Delia is never stands on her own two feet, she goes from depending on her brother, to depending on the Ryan family. Though Delia uses her femininity to manipulate, she does it out of love. Kristen described the character's speech as \\"Deliaspeak.\\" Like most, she also referred to the character as a \\"child woman.\\" Delia is never cruel intentions, but she goes to any extreme to get what she wants, and often does things that are counterproductive. In 2008, Kristen described Delia as \\"semi-tragic\\" and a \\"very unhappy person.\\" Seli Graves referred to the character as \\"delightfully,\\" and \\"deliciously devious.\\" Us Magazine hailed the character as the bitchiest new character of the year in 1977. Kristen also referred to the character as \\"starved for attention.\\" According to Claire Labine, Delia is not the \\"traditional bad girl.\\" Instead, Delia is someone who possesses \\"desperate insecurities.\\" Storylines =Backstory= Delia Reid grows up as a very lonely and confused child. Her father ends up in a mental institution and her mother works herself into an early grave leaving Delia in the care of her older brother, Bob. Delia becomes close to the Ryan family when the matriarch, Maeve (Helen Gallagher) shows her kindness and gives her food. As a teenager, Delia falls in love with the youngest Ryan son, Patrick. However, their romance ends when Pat chooses his medical career over her. Delia later begins seeing the mysterious Victor Jerome (Jack Axelrod). She later discovers that he is a mobster and she breaks off the relationship only to learn she is pregnant. Delia gives birth to a daughter whom she puts up for adoption. Delia then falls for Pat's older brother, Frank Ryan and they marry in 1970. The marriage is strained due to Frank's law school affair with Jillian Coleridge. Delia then gets herself pregnant believing it will keep Frank from straying. Delia grows up without any guidance or security due to losing her parents at such a young age. She has a lot love to give, but is unaware of the appropriate ways to show her love for others. =1975‚Äì1989= In July 1975, Frank (Michael Hawkins) confronts Delia on the stairs at Riverside Hospital and asks her for a divorce and she angrily pushes him down the stairs. Though he nearly dies, Frank still covers for Delia and they try to repair their marriage. In November 1976, Delia shoves Frank's lover, Jill Coleridge (Nancy Addison), falling over Little John's tricycle, and she sustains some injuries, being shoved in the same manner as she shoved Frank, which angers the Ryan family towards her, and imperils her chances of getting custody of her son. However, when Delia begins an affair with Dr. Roger Coleridge (Ron Hale), Jill's brother, Frank divorces her in February 1977. Delia then turns to her first love, Patrick (Malcolm Groome) and seduces him. After Delia announces her pregnancy, Pat proposes marriage. Delia secretly miscarries on April 1, 1977, but keeps quiet as she marries Pat several weeks later. During the marriage, Delia resorts to extremes to keep Patrick's attention including faking a miscarriage and a mental breakdowns. When Pat turns to drugs and pushes her down the stairs during a confrontation, Delia is left temporarily blind; though she recovers, Delia continues to fake blindness. During a cruise in April 1978, Pat finds out that Delia was faking the blindness. When they return to Riverside, he also finds out from Roger and Faith all of Delia's schemes over the past year. The Ryan family then confront Delia on all her crimes, then decide to detach from her behavior. Delia goes into therapy, then agrees to having the marriage annulled in September 1978. Roger convinces Delia that she is fine just the way she is. He helps Delia establish her independence. They marry in October 1978. Delia (Edwards) becomes heavily involved in the stock market and her investments begin to pay off. However, when Roger suspects her of cheating with her stock broker, her divorces her. Delia later opens her own restaurant, The Crystal Palace and begins dating Ryan family cousin, Barry (Richard Backus). When Delia finds out Barry has been cheating on her, she runs him over and frames her former sister-in-law, Faith Coleridge (Karen Morris-Gowdy) for the crime. Due to lack of finances, Delia loses her business to mob boss, Joe Novak (Roscoe Born); however she is forced to shut The Palace down in 1982. Delia leaves Riverside in November 1983 after getting a job offer. In actuality, Frank (Geoff Pierson) sets up the job with the help of Rae Woodard so he can get custody of Little John. Delia resurfaces on June 15, 1984 when she marries wealthy oilman Matthew Crane (Harve Presnell). The marriage quickly falls apart due to Delia's affair with Steve Latham (Franc Luz). After the divorce, Delia relocates to California. Delia returns to Riverside in September 1986 for her grandson Owen's christening. Delia sets her sights on Roger once again and does her best to win his affections from his wife, Maggie Shelby (Cali Timmins). Delia even kidnaps the pregnant Maggie and helps to deliver her daughter, Olivia. Maggie eventually leaves town allowing for Roger and Delia to reconnect. The couple remarries on January 9, 1989. =2013‚Äì15= Delia was introduced on General Hospital in October 2013 when she is visited by Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) and Silas Clay (Michael Easton) and forced to admit that she is the biological mother of Ava Jerome (Maura West) from an affair with late mobster, Victor Jerome (Jack Axelrod). Delia and Ava eventually reunite when Ava shows up in New York. Delia later comes to Port Charles to run interference with Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) for Ava. Ava reveals that she killed Sonny's girlfriend and that Sonny will kill her once she delivers her baby. To protect her daughter, Delia tries to steal information implicating Sonny in another murder but is caught and sent back to New York. When Ava was presumed dead, she popped up at Ryan's Bar to tell her mother that she was alive, and the two of them later schemed to give Ava another identity as a dark-haired look-alike whom Delia claimed was a twin she had also given up for adoption. Reception Ilene Kristen was immediately praised for her portrayal of Delia. Ronni Ashcroft who praised Kristen for her portrayal said, \\"it's a wonder she's able to pull off Delia's bitchiness so convincingly\\" because the two were exact opposites of one another. Francine L. Trevens said, \\"She plays Delia to perfection.\\" In 1978, Kristen won Afternoon TV Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Delia. Kristen also earned two Soap Opera Digest Award nominations for Outstanding Comic Performance in 1988, and for Outstanding Villainess in 1989. Kristen ranked at #21 on We Love Soaps list of the 50 Greatest Soap Actresses. Fans immediately took to Edwards in the role. John N. Goudas praised Edwards for her portrayal and said the actress made the character very multidimensional. Edwards' firing was met with skepticism from Lynda Hirsch who said that Edwards had become very popular in her own right. Because the actresses were so different, \\"it's hard to imagine Delia reverting into the character that Ilene made her originally,\\" said Hirsch. Despite Edwards success in the role, Kristen believed that only she could capture the true essence of Delia. Seli Graves agreed with Kristen's assessment in 1988 and said the character \\"resisted anyone else's efforts to bring out the unique qualities\\" of Delia.

The group consists of Guitarist Nick DePirro, Bassist Reilly Herrera and Drummer/Digital Percussionist Aric Improta. The band has 4 releases to date and is currently signed to Graphic Nature/Equal Vision Records (US). History =Formation= Night Verses was formed in Los Angeles, California in 2012. Early that year, Douglas Robinson (former lead vocalist of The Sleeping) was attending a local charity show that was being put on by a close friend. One of the bands to play that night was Fullerton based Post-Rock act known as The Sound Archives. Nick, Reilly and Aric had been writing and performing together 10 years prior under different band names, this just happened to be their most recent instrumental endeavor following the departure of former singer Marco Lira. Robinson was so impressed with their performance, that he approached the band immediately after the show and displayed interest in being a vocal addition to the group. After a single practice session the same night, the band knew the addition felt right and began working with Robinson on demos which would soon result in the material used on the Out of the Sky EP. =Out of the Sky EP= Soon after formation, the group recorded the Out of the Sky EP with producer Kris Crummet at Interlaced Audio in Portland, Oregon. The EP was self released on May 25, 2012 and contained 4 tracks which added up to just under 19 min in length. It was self-released on the band's website (www.nightverses.com), free for public download for the rest of the year. The EP was well received by critics and won EP of the year on Punktastic's Reader awards. This release was followed immediately by a headlining UK tour with Flood of Red as main support and a spot on the main stage at Hevy Fest 2012. Throughout this time, the band was working on material for their soon to be recorded debut album Lift Your Existence. In an interview with Criticalwave.co.uk, the band stated that they had written around 50 songs for the album and were in the process of narrowing them down to the very best. =Lift Your Existence= On January 5, 2013, the band headed back to Interlace Audio to record their debut full length with Kris Crummett. The album was titled Lift Your Existence and released on June 25, 2013 via Easy Killer (US) and July 22, 2013 on Southworld (UK) records. The album received critical acclaim both nationally and internationally, and was considered an early \\"AOTY\\" (album of the year) contender on multiple sites and magazines. :Liam Spencer of Daily Dischord stated, \\"Never have a band so early in their existence managed to compile such a spectacular piece of work as that which is found on this album. With such a wide array of emotions put on a pedestal and decorated with such beautiful musical craftsmanship, you‚Äôll be hard pushed to find another record in 2013 that seizes your attention quite like this.\\" =Into the Vanishing Light= On September 10, 2015, Night Verses announced signing to Equal Vision/Graphic Nature Records and that they had begun recording their second LP with Ross Robinson (Slipknot, At the Drive-In, Norma Jean). The band stated in the press release, \\"The new album will put an emphasis on a presenting a fuller, darker ambience than our previous releases, with more effects, live electronics, experimentation and an overall massive sound.\\" On May 27, 2016, the band confirmed that the title of their second album would be 'Into The Vanishing Light', and it would be released on July 8, 2016. This was also accompanied with a full stream of the first single from the record, 'A Dialogue In Cataplexy'. On September 5, 2017 the band announced the departure of vocalist Douglas Robinson. =From the Gallery of Sleep= On January 19, 2018 Night Verses dropped a 3 song preview of their upcoming full length via Equal Vision Records. The release was titled Copper Wasp EP in reference to the first of the 3 songs, however the band stressed that it was strictly a preview of the album and not to be considered a separate \\"EP\\" release like Out of the Sky was. In an interview with New Noise Magazine, Nick stated \\"With this new record, it was a goal of ours to fill up as much sound as possible between 3 people, while still actually pulling it all off live. Not just technically speaking, but atmospherically as well[...]\\" He later added \\"We wanted the songs to be reminiscent of dream sequences.\\" In reference to LP3. On May 31st, the band released their first single \\"Phoenix IV: Levitation\\" for their upcoming record From the Gallery of Sleep. The album was released on June 29th, 2018. Musical Style & Influences Night Verses have been noted for their vast use of guitar effects, intricate rhythm section and introspective/emotive vocals. Their consistent layering of effected textures and diverse rhythmic choices lean them more towards the genres like Space rock, Art rock and even some Shoegaze. However, their more aggressive passages and emotionally driven vocals often create similar moments to those found within the Alternative metal, Post-hardcore and Metalcore genres. In multiple interviews the band has referenced Tool, Isis, Fiona Apple, At the Drive-In, Opeth, Bj√∂rk, Deftones, DJ Shadow, Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine, various Trip hop Artists and the film Beyond the Black Rainbow as influences that have had a heavy impact on their sound.  Other Projects  The Drum Chain was a video collaboration project released via the band's youtube channel. They created a single composition featuring 9 different drummers. According to an article posted by Modern Drummer, each drummer was asked to record 16 bars of 4/4 over 140 BPM. The band then put the rhythmic compositions together and wrote music over the top of the piece to make it feel like one song. The drummers involved (aside from Aric) were: Billy Rymer (The Dillinger Escape Plan), Anup Sastry (formerly of Intervals (band) and Monuments (metal band)), Mike Ieradi (Protest the Hero), Alex Bent (Trivium (band)/ Ex-Battlecross), Garrett Henritz (formerly of Fol Chen and HRVRD), Loniel Robinson (letlive), Joseph Arrington (A Lot Like Birds), Mathew Lynch (Foregin Air/Trioscapes). Aric Improta is currently also a member of The Fever 333 a politically charged rock band featuring Jason Aalon Butler formerly of letlive and Stephen Harrison formerly of The Chariot (band). The group has also had collaborative association with Travis Barker and John Feldmann. He also occasionally performs live with Goldfinger (band), he's recorded drums on the last 2 Gin Wigmore records and has participated in multiple Drum Festivals around the world. Meinl Cymbals released a studio re-recording of his 40 min solo performed at Meinl Drum Festival in Gutenstetten, Germany on July 1, 2017 via their youtube channel. The piece is entitled Blur-Lights in the Videodrome. Reilly Herrera is co-owner and creator of Learn to Forget clothing and has performed live on bass with both letlive and HRVRD. Nick DePirro has released various solo records that can be found at nickdepirro.bandcamp.com and has posts new clips often via his instagram. Nick has also performed guitar live with letlive and Norma Jean (band).

Technology Arnold is based on Monte Carlo Ray Tracing. Its engine is optimized to send billions of spatially incoherent rays throughout a scene. It often uses one level of diffuse inter- reflection so that light can bounce off of a wall or other object and indirectly illuminate a subject. For complex scenes such as the space station in Elysium, it makes heavy use of instancing. It uses the Open Shading Language to define the materials and textures. History Marcos Fajardo at the 2013 SIGGRAPH Marcos Fajardo is the chief architect of Arnold. The beginnings of what is now Arnold emerged in 1997 when Fajardo decided to write his own renderer. That year, he attended SIGGRAPH, where his interest in stochastic ray tracing (a foundational part of Arnold's rendering technology) was piqued in discussions with friends attending the conference. Early versions of Fajardo's renderer were called RenderAPI. The name Arnold emerged when one of Fajardo's friends suggested it after mocking an Arnold Schwarzenegger film they saw in a theater.

The movement has taken place since the 1980s and 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and alongside the ethnonational and cultural reawakening of the Finnic peoples of Russia, the Estonians and the Finns.Schnirelmann, pp. 199-209 In fact, Neopagan movements in Finland and Estonia have much older roots, dating from the early 20th century. Among the Finnic peoples of the Volga Federal District of Russia (the Volga Finns and Udmurts), scholar Victor Schnirelmann has observed two cooperating patterns of development of Neopaganism: the reactivation of authentic rituals and worship ceremonies in the countrysides, and the development of systematised doctrines amongst the urban intelligentsia rejecting Russian Orthodoxy as a foreign religion.Schnirelmann, p. 202 The Uralic Communion, founded in 2001, is an organisation for the cooperation of different institutions promoting Uralic indigenous religions. Religions =Estonian native religion= The Estonian native religion (Estonian: Maausk, literally \\"Native Religion\\" or \\"Land's Faith\\"),Maavalla Koda. The Estonian Native Religion. or Estonian Neopaganism, is the name, in English, for a grouping of contemporary revivals (often called \\"Neopagan\\", although adherents of Estonian native religion generally don't use the termJ√ºri Toomepuu. Maausk, the belief system of indigenous Estonians. Presentation at KLENK 2011, published on January 7, 2012. St. Petersburg, Florida.) of the indigenous Pagan religion of the Estonian people. It encompasses \\"Taaraism\\" (Estonian: Taarausk literally \\"Taara Faith\\"),Ellen Barry for the New York Times. Some Estonians return to pre-Christian animist traditions. Quote: ¬´Craving an authentic national faith, Estonians have been drawn to the animistic religions that preceded Christianity: Taarausk, or Taaraism, whose god was worshiped in forest groves, and Maausk, which translates as \\"faith of the earth\\".¬ª a monistic religion centered on god Tharapita founded in 1928 by intellectuals as a national religion; and Maausk as a much broader definition of \\"Native Faith\\", encompassing grassroots movements of local gods worship, nature worship and earth worship. Both the kinds of the movement are administered by the Maavalla Koda organisation. According to a 2002 survey, 11% of the population of Estonia claim that \\"out of all the religions they have the warmest feelings towards Taaraism and Maausk\\".Ahto Kaasik. Old Estonian Religion . Maavalla Koda. =Finnish native religion= The Tursaansyd√§n, a Finnish Pagan symbol. The Finnish native religion (: \\"Finnish Faith\\"), or Finnish Neopaganism, is the contemporary Neopagan revival of Finnish paganism, the pre-Christian polytheistic ethnic religion of the Finns. A precursor movement was the Ukkousko (\\"Ukko Faith\\", revolving around the god Ukko) of the early 20th century. The main problem in the revival of Finnish paganism is the nature of pre-Christian Finnish culture, which relied on oral tradition and very little is left.Arola 2010, p. 26 The primary sources concerning Finnish native culture are written by latter-era Christians. They may be biased, tainted or unreliable. The national epic is the Kalevala. There are two main organisations of the religion, the \\"Association of Finnish Native Religion\\" (Suomalaisen kansanuskon yhdistys ry) based in Helsinki and officially registered since 2002,Uskonnot Suomessa. Suomalaisen kansanuskon yhdistys ry. and the \\"Taivaannaula\\" association headquartered in Turku with branches in many cities, founded and officially registered in 2007.Uskonnot Suomessa. Taivaannaula ry. The Association of Finnish Native Religion also caters to Karelians and is a member of the Uralic Communion.Maavalla Koda, \\"Uralic Communion\\" section. Quote: ¬´In 10214 (2001) Maavalla Koda together with the representatives of Finnish (Suomen kansanuskon yhdistus ry.), Mari (Osh mari Chi mari and Sorta) and Erzya indigenous religions founded the Uralic Communion. The aim of the Uralic Communion is to establish contacts between different indigenous religions and to contribute to the maintenance and strengthening of these religions.¬ª =Hungarian native religion= Two-barred crosses symbolise the tree of life in Hungarian Native Faith. The Hungarian Native Faith (Hungarian: ≈êsmagyar Vall√°s), also termed Hungarian Neopaganism, is a modern Pagan new religious movement aimed at representing an ethnic religion of the Hungarians, inspired by taltosism (Hungarian shamanism), ancient mythology and later folklore. The Hungarian Native Faith movement has roots in 18th- and 19th-century Enlightenment and Romantic elaborations, and early-20th-century ethnology. The construction of a national Hungarian religion was endorsed in interwar Turanist circles (1930s‚Äì1940s), and, eventually, Hungarian Native Faith movements blossomed in Hungary after the fall of the Soviet Union. The boundaries between Hungarian Native Faith groups are often traced along their differing ideas about the ethnogenetic origins of the Hungarians, which have historically been a matter of debate. Many organisations acknowledge the commonly accepted theory that Hungarians originated among the Finno-Ugric peoples. Other Hungarian Native Faith groups, however, cultivate further links with Scythian, Sumerian, Turkic and other cultures. =Mari native religion= The Mari native religion (Mari: –ß–∏–º–∞—Ä–∏–π –π”±–ª–∞, ƒåimarij j√ºla), also Mari Neopaganism, is the ethnic religion of the Mari people, a Volga Finnic ethnic group based in the republic of Mari El, in Russia. Unlike other neopagan movements, the Mari native religion, called Marla, is probably among the only ones to have been practiced without interruption since the Neolithic. The religion has undergone changes over time, particularly under the influence of neighbouring monotheisms. In the last few decades, while keeping its traditional features in the countryside, an organised Neopagan revival has taken place.Vladimir Napolskikh. Notes at the Margins: Neopaganism in Eurasia. // Eurasian Journal / Acta Eurasica. Number 1. Moscow, 2002. The Mari religion is based on the worship of the forces of nature, which man must honour and respect. Before the spread of monotheistic teachings amongst the Mari, they worshipped many gods (the jumo, a word cognate to the Finnish Jumala), while recognising the primacy of a \\"Great God\\", Kugu Jumo. In the 19th century, influenced by monotheism, the Pagan beliefs altered and the image of a Osh Kugu Jumo, literally \\"Great God of Light\\", was strengthened. Subject to persecution in the Soviet Union, the faith has been granted official status since the 1990s by the government of Mari El, where it is recognized as one of the three traditional faiths along with Orthodox Christianity and Islam. Some activists claim that the Mari native religion believers are subject to pressure by Russian authorities as part of a wider campaign to Russify Mari culture. Vitaly Tanakov, an adherent of the faith, was charged with inciting religious, national, social and linguistic hatred after publishing the book The Priest Speaks.Alexander Verkhovsky. Anti-Extremist Legislation and Its Enforcement. SOVA, 2007. =Mordvin native religion= Ritual preparations for the Rasken Ozks, the Mordvin national worship ceremony. The Mordvin native religion, also called Erzyan native religion, or Mordvin-Erzyan Neopaganism, is the modern revival of the ethnic religion of the Mordvins (Erzya and Moksha), peoples of Volga Finnic ethnic stock dwelling in their republic of Mordovia within Russia, or in bordering lands of Russia. The name of the originating god according to the Mordvin tradition is Ineshkipaz. The Mordvins were almost fully Christianised since the times of Kievan Rus', although Pagan customs were preserved in the folklore and few villages preserved utterly the native faith at least until further missionary activities of the Russian Orthodox Church in the 17th century and in the early 20th century.Filatov, Sergei; Shchipkov, Aleksandr. p. 234 The Neopagan revival was started in 1990,Schnirelmann, p. 206 alongside that of many other native religions in Russia, just in the verge of dissolution of the Soviet Union. According to scholar Victor Schnirelmann 2% of the Mordvins adhere to the Mordvin native faith,Schnirelmann, p. 208. Adherents of the Erzyan Mastor organisation organise the Rasken Ozks (Mordvin for: \\"Native Prayer\\"), a national Mordvin worship service held yearly, with participation also of members of the Mastorava organisation and other ones.Republic of Mordovia. –í —Å–µ–ª–µ –ß—É–∫–∞–ª—ã –ø—Ä–æ—à–µ–ª —ç—Ä–∑—è–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –ø—Ä–∞–∑–¥–Ω–∏–∫ \\"–†–∞—Å—å–∫–µ–Ω—å –û–∑–∫—Å\\".Uralistica News. –ú–æ—Ä–¥–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–µ –°–ú–ò –º–æ–ª—á–∞—Ç –æ –ø—Ä–∞–∑–¥–Ω–∏–∫–µ ¬´–≠—Ä–∑—è–Ω—å –†–∞—Å—å–∫–µ–Ω—å –û–∑–∫—Å¬ª.2013-—Ü–µ –∏–µ–Ω—å ¬´–†–∞—Å—å–∫–µ–Ω—å –æ–∑–∫—Å¬ª. vaigel.ru. =Udmurt Vosh= Udmurt Vosh (Udmurt: –£–¥–º—É—Ä—Ç –í–æ—Å—å, literally \\"Udmurt Faith\\") is the ethnic religious revival of the Udmurts, a Volga Finnic ethnic group mostly inhabiting their republic within Russia, that is Udmurtia. Amongst the Udmurts, as in other Finno-Ugric republics in the Volga region, the revival of Paganism is inextricably intertwined with the revival of national-ethnic culture and awareness.Filatov-Shchipkov, 1997, p. 177 The Udmurtian Pagan revival circles sprang out of the Demen (Udmurt for \\"Society\\") movement which was established in December 1989 for the protection and restoration of the Udmurt ethnic culture. Udmurt Vos as an institution was founded in 1994.Taagepera p. 279 According to 2012 statistics, 2% of the population of Udmurtia adheres to forms of Paganism. Victor Schnirelmann reported an adherence of 4% for the Udmurts alone.

He served as the vice-president of the American Psychiatric Association in 1970-1971, the first African-American to gain elected office in the organization. Prudhomme was born in Opelousas, Louisiana. When Charles was three years old, his father developed tuberculosis and the family moved to Denver, Colorado. Along the way, the family stopped in Kansas City, Missouri where Charles and his mother stayed while his father continued to Denver. Charles received his schooling in Kansas City, became a baseball player, and graduated from high school, second in his class. Prudhomme entered the University of Kansas but remained only a short time. Due to segregation laws, he was not allowed to take certain courses or use the university's facilities. He applied for and received a scholarship to Howard University, a historically black college, in Washington, DC, and over the next six years he attended college and worked. He graduated in 1931 and entered the Howard University College of Medicine. He received his M.D. in 1935. He interned in internal medicine at the Freedman's Hospital (now Howard University Hospital) in Washington, DC. During his years at Howard, medical students attended lectures at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, a federally funded psychiatric hospital for mental patients. Dr. Benjamin Karpman, a psychoanalyst and forensic psychiatrist, was a member of the hospital staff, and a professor of psychiatry at Howard. Prudhomme attended his classes and wrote his senior paper on suicide which was published in 1938 in the journal, The Psychoanalytic Review. Prudhomme planned to do a psychiatric residency at St. Elizabeth's but he was told that federal legislation, which established the hospital in 1855, enforced segregation. In 1937, he obtained a fellowship at the University of Chicago but was dismayed to learn that he was assigned to work at the Provident Hospital, which provided medical care to black people. He returned to Washington, DC to work at St. Elizabeth's, but he was unsuccessful. In 1940, using his contacts with then U.S. Senator Harry Truman, arrangements were made for Prudhomme to go to Tuskegee, Alabama, and work at the Veterans Administration hospital for black veterans. He met many black psychiatrists who had been trained in Boston by Solomon Carter Fuller (1872-1953), the first American black psychiatrist. Prudhomme remained at Tuskegee until 1943 when the U.S. Army transferred him to Howard University to head the Army Specialized Training Unit. While at Howard, he registered at the Washington School of Psychiatry to study and train under Dr. Freida Fromm- Reichmann, a German psychiatrist. Prudhomme was admitted to the Washington Psychoanalytic Society in 1958, but only after he was required to complete additional training. Prudhomme's writings discuss his experiences with racism, which he encountered throughout his professional career. Prudhomme practiced psychoanalysis in Washington, DC for many years and taught at Howard University. He often pointed to the importance of cultural patterns in the practice of psychiatry.

Early life Originally from Burgundy, Franc√©s has been documented as residing in Le√≥n, Spain since before 1434 and until May 1468, the date of his death. He worked on an altarpiece for the Le√≥n Cathedral, around July 25, 1434. A year later he had fixed his residence along with his wife Juana Martinez to Cardiles Street, in a house owned by the city council. By 1461 the painter had executed major expansions to the house. He added a kitchen with cellar, yard, well, stable and barn, and farms. Le√≥n Cathedral The old altar of the Le√≥n Cathedral, made up of more than a hundred tables, was since dismantled in 1740 after being replaced by another Baroque altarpiece. Only five of the eighteen major scenes were embedded in the current neomud√©jar altarpiece, and a score of smaller tables occupying the grooves, reused in the episcopal chair of the same presbytery. The motifs represented, with a major feature anecdotal painter and symbolic content, are scenes from the lives of San Froilan, Bishop of Leon, and the Virgin Mary. Also characteristic are the bright colors that highlight the table, which according to S√°nchez Canton, Franc√©s is the first painter to handle the oil painting technique in Castile, after similar work by Jan van Eyck, although in fact it is a tempera painting with glazes. Additional work Franc√©s continuously worked to serve the city council as shown by a document from 1445, where it was said that he had become very necessary for the work at the Cathedral. In 1452 the cathedral chapter entrusted to toe painting a mural temple Doomsday, destroyed in the early nineteenth century. In preparation he traveled to Salamanca to study Judgement fresco painted a few years ago by Nicholas Florentino in the Old Cathedral. In 1459 he started the decoration of the cloister, hired ten years ago, for which he made a series of thirty-one evangelical matters murals, of which twenty have arrived in poor condition. Providing additional information on the progress of the project, fabric and revenue books of the cathedral documented many related orders of various kinds, from providing the lead for the windows of the chapel of San Fabian and San Sebasti√°n (now Santa Teresa), where the paintings are also murals dating from 1459, the gold of the organs, cleaning a statue of the Virgin or painting a banner. In the same cathedral there are some additional paintings with some other murals in the apse chapels and traces of the windows of the door of the Virgen del Dado, also attributed to Franc√©s. Style The cathedral altarpiece paintings documented, along with a picture of the Nativity, allegedly signed with an \\"N\\" in a hymnal of the collegiate Basilica of San Isidoro, helped define his style of painting, which combines the clarity and Italian Flemish attention to detail, and attribute some other works, among which the Altarpiece of the Life of the Virgin and Saint Francis (Museo del Prado), from Chapel Farm Esteva of Delights in the vicinity of La Ba√±eza. Acquired by the state between 1930 and 1932, the altarpiece, painted perhaps for an unknown Franciscan monastery consists of nine large tables on three streets and three bodies, with the Virgin and Child enthroned between angels in the central panel, scenes the life of St. Francis of Assisi on the left and right, and sixteen small panels with apostles and prophets. His work is considered one of St. Jerome altarpiece owned by the National Gallery of Ireland and a possible table altarpiece dedicated to St. Michael that resides in Nationalmuseum was also attributed to Franc√©s. An \\"early work\\", the altarpiece Counter Hood Saldana Lopez at the Royal Convent of Santa Clara is also attributed to him, probably using imported labor.

They released a self-titled EP in 2012, followed by their debut studio album Outside the Box in 2016. History Hacktivist began in 2011 when former guitarist Timfy James left his previous band 'Heart of a Coward'. James claims that the formation of Hacktivist was a \\"fluke\\", with no intention of developing such a style, but the group was born when peer J Hurley, a local rapper with little history in the metal scene, began recording vocals over some of James' demos.Interview with Hacktivist Metal Mouth. January 15, 2013. Retrieved August 6, 2013. After the demos became very popular online, James decided to recruit a full lineup, bringing in Richard Hawking on drums, Josh Gurner (ex-Sacred Mother Tongue) on bass and Ben Marvin (James's former bandmate in Heart Of A Coward) as a second vocalist. The band began work on an EP in 2012 and debut single \\"Unlike Us\\" reached No. 2 in the Amazon UK metal chart within 48 hours.Hacktivist: 'We're uniting a lot of people' The Guardian. 1 November 2012. Retrieved 6 August 2013.

October 8, 2012. Retrieved August 6, 2013. and considerable airplay on BBC Radio 1. After the release of the Hacktivist EP, the band set out to tour. This included supporting slots for acts such as Enter Shikari and Korn and performances in European festivals such as Sonisphere Festival, Download Festival and Rock am Ring and Rock im Park in summer 2013. In April 2013 the group released a new song \\"Elevate\\", with an accompanying video, for free downloadHACKTIVIST Debut New Video And Offer Free Download Metal Mouth. 8 April 2013. Retrieved 6 August 2013. and this was followed up in August with a cover of \\"Niggas In Paris\\" (originally by Jay-Z and Kanye West). A video for \\"Niggas In Paris\\" was filmed during their set at Download Festival 2013. They also performed a live session for BBC Radio 1 at Maida Vale Studios. The band headed out on a UK headline tour throughout winter 2013, supported by The Algorithm. A re-release of their debut EP with 4 bonus tracks was released on 11 November 2013. The band has shown support for hacktivism collective Anonymous, and appear to support \\"whistle-blowers\\" Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning whom they reference in the song 'Cold Shoulders'. On 4 August 2014 Hacktivist released the single and video for \\"False Idols\\". Many references to activism (especially hacktivist collective Anonymous) are made throughout the video and within hours the song had reached number 1 on the iTunes Metal chart. This release was followed on 12 November by \\"Deceive and Defy\\" (also accompanied by a video), featuring Charlie Holmes of Heart in Hand on vocals. Hacktivist then toured the UK from November to December, supported by Dead Harts and the One Hundred. Following the release of the single \\"Buszy\\" on 17 January 2016, their debut studio album Outside the Box was released on 4 March 2016. On the 20 January 2017, it was announced that Hacktivist and Ben Marvin were parting ways due to Ben's family commitments, and rapper/vocalist Jot Maxi was brought in as the new co-vocalist. May 31, 2017 saw the release of single '2 Rotten' with an accompanying video. The track was essentially a heavier remix of track 'Rotten' from Outside the Box but with Jot Maxi taking a leading role as opposed to the 16-bar feature slot he had in the original. The single was well received despite the video not achieving as many YouTube views as previous releases, with the general census across social media being that Jot is a welcome addition to the band and that a 2nd album is eagerly anticipated by fans. On the 28th of March 2018 it was announced that Hacktivist and Timfy James had parted ways. Following on from this the band recruited James Hewitt (of bands 'Invocation' and 'Exist Immortal') as their new guitarist and producer with an official announcement made on the 19 January 2019. Hewitt had been playing live and writing new material with the band since June 2018. As a result, Josh Gurner would provide clean vocals following Timfy James' departure. The band embarked on a headline UK tour in Jan/Feb 2019 and went on to release the single 'Reprogram' with accompanying video on the 10th of April 2019. Musical style Hacktivist's music is a blend of several different styles. They are noted for using eight-string guitars and six-string basses both tuned down to Drop E to achieve an extremely low tuned, distorted and dark sound, as well as ambient passages and a \\"wall of sound\\" production style. Their vocals are primarily rapped, although they also make use of conventional singing and occasional harsh vocals. They write their lyrics collectively, focusing on political subjects such as anarchism, conspiracy theories, government corruption, censorship, anti-gun violence, unity against oppression and other social and economic issues. The band's music has been described as rap metal and grime, as fusing djent and nu metal, or more generally as adding rapping to djent. They have also been said to use elements of groove metal. Their guitar compositions have been described as reminiscent of both Meshuggah and nu metal bands such as Limp Bizkit and Korn.

John Sontag was the oldest son of Maria (Bohn) and Jacob Contant of Mankato, Minnesota. After the death of his father in 1867, his mother remarried to Matthias Sontag, a Union Army veteran of the Civil War; John then adopted the last name of Sontag. John Sontag had one sibling, George (born 1864), who kept his last name, but did occasionally use the last name of Sontag. Celebrated Criminal Cases of America p.276 published 1910 John and George were frequently partners in crime and were known as The Sontag Brothers. John Sontag came to California to work for the Southern Pacific Transportation Company. While coupling rail cars in the company yard in Fresno his leg was crushed; he accused Southern Pacific of failure to care for his on-the-job wounds and their refusal to rehire him after he had healed. In 1889, John Sontag was working on the farm of Canadian Christopher \\"Chris\\" Evans near Visalia in Tulare County. Evans was outraged by Southern Pacific's high freight rates and the pressuring of landowners to sell their property to the railroad. This seizure of particularly valuable wheat-farming land is known as the Mussel Slough Tragedy. Later Sontag and Evans went on to lease a livery stable in Modesto, but after a year the structure burned and the horses were lost in the fire. At some point Sontag became engaged to Eva, daughter of Evans. After the failure of the livery yard Sontag and Evans began robbing trains in such locations as Ceres, Goshen, Pixley, and Alila, later Earlimart. After each robbery, they would hide in remote places in the foothills of the Eshom Valley, such as Fort Defiance, or Roop's Fort near Susanville, California. The two would leave horses at the spot where they intended to stop the train and would then walk back to the depot and secretly board the train. When the train neared the spot with the waiting horses, the bandits would burst forth from their hiding locations and order the engineer to halt the train; they would dynamite the express car to gain access to the money on board. Finally, they would mount their waiting horses and make their getaway. Sontag and Evans travelled to Minnesota where they met up with Sontag's brother George Contant, who had been released from Nebraska State Penitentiary in Omaha in 1887 after serving time for theft. On July 1, 1892, they robbed a train while riding along the Minnesota River between St. Peter and Kasota; they acquired nothing of much value, but their crime aroused the concern of Pinkerton detectives. A month later they travelled to California and robbed a train at Collis, now Kerman in Fresno County. They were more successful this time, netting $500 and bags of Mexican and Peruvian coins of no apparent value. Several days later, law-enforcement officers arrested Contant in connection with the crime, but Sontag and Evans fled and spent almost a year as fugitives. John Sontag wounded at Battle of Stone Corral 1893 Chris Evans after the shootout at the Stone Corral. Sontag and Evans were captured in what is now called the Battle of Stone Corral. Shots were fired by members of the posse sent from Visalia. Chris Evans surrendered, but as a result of the shootout he lost an eye and his left arm. Sontag was captured while lying in straw and manure near a deserted cabin at Stone Corral; he sustained severe wounds in the chest and forehead and died (from the wounds or tetanus) in Fresno while in custody. John Sontag is interred at Calvary Cemetery in Fresno; his tombstone lists his death as occurring in 1892, instead of 1893 so it erroneously indicates that he was 33 years, 6 months, and 4 days old at the time of his death. Contant was at Folsom State Prison where he was serving his sentence after being found guilty of train robbery in October 1892, he served fifteen years. After release from prison he wrote an autobiography A Pardoned Lifer, with Opie Warner as his ghostwriter. He lectured in Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and at the Mankato Opera House on the folly of living outside the law. About 1915, he produced a film, The Folly of a Life of Crime; there are no surviving copies. His last whereabouts are unknown, but in 1929 was listed as living in San Francisco in his mother's obituary. Chris Evans was also sent to Folsom where he remained for seventeen years until pardoned by Governor Hiram Johnson; he denied ever robbing a train and claimed that when he killed it was in self-defense. After released he was banished from California and spent his last years in Portland, Oregon, dying in 1917. While in prison he turned to socialism as his remedy for what he perceived as the corrupt practices of business conglomerates. The Sontag-Evans case was featured in an episode of Stories of the Century starring Jim Davis, with Kristine Miller. The two portray railroad detectives investigating California train robberies. John Sontag was portrayed by John Smith‚Äô‚Äô and Chris Evans by Morris Ankrum.

He graduated from the Jacobs School of Music of Indiana University with a bachelor's degree in music in 1986. Upon graduation, he participated in the San Francisco Opera's Merola Opera Program as an apprentice coach in 1986 and 1987, and won the Otto Guth Memorial Award for excellence in vocal coaching both years. Summers's first professional engagement, with San Francisco Opera's Western Opera Theater, was conducting La boh√®me in its 1986‚Äì87 season. Following that performance, he served as musical director of the Western Opera Theater until 1989. He led the Western Opera Theater on its 1987 tour to China, performing for audiences that had never experienced Western opera. In 1988, he conducted the first Chinese performances of Puccini's Tosca in the modern era. In 1989, Summers began his tenure as the music director of the San Francisco Opera Center, a training program for young singers; his first mainstage production, Die Fledermaus, was in 1990. Other highlights include collaborating with Andr√© Previn on the 1998 world premiere of A Streetcar Named Desire and conducting several of the performances; serving as principal guest conductor from 1999 through 2016; conducting Jake Heggie's Moby-Dick, which was recorded and telecast on PBS's Great Performances; and in 2015 receiving the San Francisco Opera Medal, the company's highest honor. He conducts the West Coast premiere of Heggie's It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life at SFO during the 2018‚Äì19 season.  Houston Grand Opera and the Metropolitan Opera  In 2011, Summers was named artistic and music director of Houston Grand Opera after serving as music director since 1998. As music director of Houston Grand Opera, Summers oversaw the foundation and development of the HGO Orchestra: prior to the orchestra's foundation, HGO hired outside orchestras for its productions. Since 1998, Summers has conducted over 60 productions at Houston Grand Opera, including eight world premieres (notably Jake Heggie's It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life, The End of the Affair, and Three Decembers and Carlisle Floyd's Cold Sassy Tree). In recent years, Summers helped oversee the creation of HGOco, an initiative designed to create partnerships between the company and the community. HGOco commissions new works and presents numerous opportunities for children and young voice students. In 1998, Summers made his Metropolitan Opera conducting debut in Johann Strauss's Die Fledermaus, and returned regularly as a guest conductor, including participating in the Metropolitan Opera's 125th Anniversary Gala. He has appeared in four of the Metropolitan Opera Live in HD transmissions of Saturday matinee performances shown in cinemas around the world and has led the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions finals concert on several occasions. In 2006, Summers led the Metropolitan Opera on a tour of Japan.  International opera conducting  Summers's European debut was in 1994 at the Rome Opera conducting Manon Lescaut. Also in 1994, he made his debut with Opera Australia, conducting La Cenerentola. He has since appeared at Barcelona's Gran Teatre del Liceu, most recently conducting La favorite (2018) after his house debut in La Cenerentola, the Welsh National Opera (Rigoletto), the Bregenz Festival (The Magic Flute and Carlisle Floyd's Of Mice and Men), Lisbon's Teatro Nacional de S√£o Carlos (Ariadne auf Naxos), the Op√©ra national de Bordeaux (Don Pasquale and La boh√®me), and the European premiere of Andr√© Previn‚Äôs A Streetcar Named Desire at the Op√©ra national du Rhin in Strasbourg.  Symphonic work  Summers is also in demand as a symphonic conductor, often in collaboration with other artists, such as sopranos Ren√©e Fleming and Christine Brewer. In 2010, Summers led pianist Yuja Wang and the Russian National Orchestra on an eight-city U.S. tour. Summers made his debut at the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet in a gala concert celebrating the company's 50th anniversary season, and his debut with the Slovenian Philharmonic Orchestra in Ljubljana conducting Michael Daugherty's Metropolis Symphony. In addition, he has conducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra at the Tanglewood Music Festival, the Colorado Symphony, the English Chamber Orchestra, the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, the Minnesota Orchestra, the Munich Symphony Orchestra, the National Arts Centre Orchestra, the National Symphony Orchestra at the Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts, the Orchestra of St. Luke's, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the St. Louis Symphony, and the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra.

Following the incident, the python was euthanized. The python's owner was charged with criminal negligence for not preventing the deaths, but was found not guilty in a jury trial in November 2016. Prior incidents The African rock python is one of the five largest snake species in the world (along with the green anaconda, reticulated python, Burmese python and amethystine python). At least two other examples of humans killed by an African rock python have been reported. A ten-year-old boy was reportedly killed and swallowed in South Africa in 2002, and a three-year-old boy was reportedly strangled by an African rock python in Centralia, Illinois in 1999. In another Canadian incident, a closely related species, a Burmese python, reportedly strangled a 28-year-old Brampton man in 1992.McDiarmid, J., \\"New Brunswick boys killed by python spent fun-filled last day\\", Toronto Star, , August 6, 2013. Event The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said the python escaped from its enclosure in the apartment and entered the living room where the boys were sleeping via the ventilation system. The python was approximately long and weighed .\\"Python's strangling of 2 boys in Canada investigated\\", CBS News, August 6, 2013. The boys, ages 4 and 6, were brothers who were visiting their friend, whose father owned a pet shop below the apartment where they were staying.Than, K., \\"Strangulation of Sleeping Boys Puts Spotlight on Pythons\\", National Geographic Daily News, August 6, 2013. The owner of the python ‚Äì Jean-Claude Savoie ‚Äì was interviewed by the Canadian network Global TV. According to the interview, the python was not in the pet store downstairs, but rather in a specially-built cage in the apartment upstairs. The python escaped from its enclosure through a hole in the ceiling, where a ventilation fan had been removed for maintenance.\\"Python enclosure in N.B. boys' deaths had 'flaw'\\", CBC News, August 14, 2013. This gave the snake direct access to the air ducts in the ceiling, which then collapsed under the snake's weight above the living room. The air duct containing the snake crashed through the ceiling tiles and onto the boys, who were sleeping on a floor mattress located about eight feet from the snake's enclosure. Controversy Several experts expressed skepticism about the incident and said that such behaviour by this type of snake would be extremely unusual,\\"Escaped python kills two young children in Canada \\", Agence France- Presse, August 6, 2013.Mahoney, J., \\"'It's Very, Very Puzzling': Snake Expert Mystified by New Brunswick Python Attack\\", The Globe and Mail, August 6, 2013. although there have been some previous reports of deadly attacks on humans. According to the reports, the snake did not consume the bodies after strangling the brothers. This ‚Äì together with the fact that more than one child was killed in a single incident and that the other occupants of the apartment were reportedly not awakened by the disturbance ‚Äì prompted questions about the circumstances regarding the alleged attack.Wood, D., Snake attack leaves many questions, The Waterloo Region Record, August 6, 2013.Withnall, A., Python escapes from Canadian pet store and kills two young brothers as they sleep, The Independent, August 6, 2013. Lee Parker, facilities manager at Reptilia, Canada's largest indoor reptile zoo, stated that these snakes do not \\"go on killing sprees. It doesn't make sense to me.\\" Though these objections were made, the possibility that the incident may be a homicide rather than an animal attack was ruled out by the RCMP. Court records revealed that the pet shop owner was found pacing outside of the store with blood on his hands and wearing shorts by police who first arrived on the scene.\\"Python pet shop owner had blood on hands\\", CBC News, August 22, 2013. The store owner told arriving police that the snake was still unaccounted for, leaving one to speculate whether the blood belonged to the boys or was his own (due to being bitten by the \\"enraged\\" snake or cut by debris from the collapsed ceiling). Kentucky Reptile Zoo director Jim Harrison stated that it was theoretically possible for the large python to have constricted around both boys at the same time, a theory supported by University of Texas professor, Neil Ford. Harrison also mentioned that since the boys handled a variety of farm animals (horses, llamas, goats, cats and dogs) earlier that day, they may have smelled like food to the snake. Although the pet shop was registered as a reptile zoo, police said that the province does not allow pythons and that the owner probably did not have the proper permits and authorization to keep the python under his care.\\"Python Escapes Cage, Kills Brothers Aged 4 and 6 in Canada\\", Latin Post, August 8, 2013. Aftermath The python was euthanized by authorities. A coroner's preliminary autopsy report released on August 7 said that the boys died of asphyxiation.Gillies, R., \\"Boys Killed by Python Died from Asphyxiation \\", MSN News, August 8, 2013.Kwong, M., \\"Boys killed by python: Case baffles snake experts \\", MSN News, August 8, 2013.McLaughlin, P., \\"Autopsy report released in N.B. snake deaths\\", CHCH News, August 7, 2013. The two boys could be seen cleaning a large glass enclosure originally belonging to a green anaconda in pictures their mother posted on Facebook. This enclosure later held the African rock python that, unlike the green anaconda, was able to escape. Member of the Legislative Assembly Donald Arseneault expressed frustration in April 2014 that the province would not review New Brunswick's Fish and Wildlife Act until the RCMP investigation was completed. Minister of Natural Resources Paul Robichaud defended the delay, saying that the completed RCMP investigation would help inform a review of the current law. Although the incident was treated as an accident, the RCMP arrested Savoie in Montreal on February 5, 2015. On March 31, 2015, Savoie was charged with criminal negligence for not preventing the deaths. However, he was found not guilty in a jury trial in November 2016.

She won gold medals in table tennis, lawn bowls, and swimming, and entered several athletics events across four Paralympic Games. Personal life Gwen Buck was born in Richmond, Surrey (now London), in 1929. She was going over a level crossing on her bicycle in 1943 when she was struck by a lorry. The accident left her with a broken back and a severed spine, and she would remain in St Peter's Hospital in Chertsey for several years. On transfer to Stoke Mandeville Hospital in 1946 she met Ludwig Guttmann who helped Buck learn to become independent as a wheelchair user. While there she developed a love for competitive sport, in particular table tennis, and she soon began competing in the Stoke Mandeville Games. Buck moved to Worcester to attend college and train as a drawing officer tracer. She returned to Richmond, finding employment with the Ministry of Works. She met future husband and fellow wheelchair user John while there, and they married in 1951. The couple retired to Stoke Mandeville and John died in 1981. She died on 13 February 2005. Alongside her own sporting accomplishments, Buck was always keen to encourage young people to participate. She was also consulted on the design of the Stoke Mandeville Stadium. Sporting career Buck's love of competitive sport was nurtured at Stoke Mandeville Hospital and she became a regular participant in the Stoke Mandeville Games. By the early 1960s she was representing Great Britain at the Commonwealth Games and the Paralympic Games. At the 1964 Games in Tokyo, Buck partnered with Susan Cunliffe-Lister, Countess of Swinton in the Women's Doubles B Table Tennis event, winning the gold medal. At the 1968 Games in Tel Aviv she spread out into a variety of other sports including lawn bowls, swimming, and three field athletics disciplines: discus, javelin, and shot put. She won gold in both the women's pairs and singles lawn bowls as well as the 25m backstroke swim. Her final gold medal came at the 1972 Games in Heidelberg for the women's pairs lawn bowls, and went on to gain further medals in 1976 before retiring for competitive sport. Buck was awarded the British Empire Medal in the early 1970s and also received the Sportswoman of the Year award from the Sports Writers Guild.

The Adyghe native religion was influenced by Hellenic religion and philosophy at the time of Greek colonisation in the Caucasus. The belief system takes its name from the homonymous Circassian epic Adyghe Habze, originally orally transmitted, which has heavily contributed to the shaping of Adyghe values over the centuries. Although historically Islamised, the period of the Soviet Union contributed to a severe weakening of Islam in the area, and especially among the Adyghe-Circassians. With the fall of the Soviet regime, the revival of Habzism as a Neopagan phenomenon was supported by Adyghe intellectuals as part of a rise in nationalism and cultural identity in the 1990s,Paul Golbe.

It is the direct successor to the Pentax K-30 model, both of which are weather-sealed. The main differences over the Pentax K-30 include a more traditional body design, 120 available body color combinations, higher max ISO range (up to 51 200), compatibility with Eye-Fi cards and an improved kit lens (Pentax K-30 included the DA L 18-55mm lens, while Pentax K-50 bundles a water-resistant version, the DA L 18-55mm WR, both with plastic mounts). Among APS-C mid-range DSLRs Among competing APS-C mid-range DSLRs, the Pentax K-50 has the smallest body, although it is 4 mm wider than its nearest rival, the Nikon D5300. The body is made from stainless steel and polycarbonate resin, as is the Canon EOS 700D. The Pentax K-50 has an onboard microphone but lacks the audio-in port of most comparable cameras, limiting its usefulness to videographers. Pentax is the only company to include a weather-resistant kit lens, Pentax K-50 with DA L 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 WR, while the higher-model Pentax K-3 offers the 18-135mm F3.5-5.6 WR in one of its kits. The Pentax K-50 is available for around $300 (body only) and less than $400 with kit lens, as of the end of July 2015, which puts it at a very low price point compared to its competition (Canon EOS 70D, Canon EOS 700D, Nikon D5300, Nikon D7100 and Pentax K-3).  Pentax K-500  The Pentax K-500 is an entry-level sibling of the Pentax K-50, sharing almost all of its features. The main differences between the two cameras are the K-500's lack of colored body options (only black), electronic level, weather sealing, and focus point visualisation through the optical viewfinder. As a consequence of the lack of weather sealing, this camera is bundled with the non-weather- sealed DA L 18-55mm kit lens, and most variants of the camera come with an AA battery holder included as opposed to the D-Li109 rechargeable Li-ion battery included with the K-50.

Along with the Staatscourant, it was the first Dutch company to receive the appellation \\"royal\\", awarded in 1806 by Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte. History Sdu became independent of the state in 1998, although the state maintained ownership of the shares. The company was reorganized, shifting its focus towards publishing rather than printing. In 1999 the company ceased printing the phone book; this lowered profits by 11%. Plans for privatization began to be made in 2000. In that same year, together with the printers Joh. Ensched√©, Sdu began printing the new Dutch passports, designed by Jaap Drupsteen. (The combination was called Ensched√©/Sdu, later renamed Sdu Identification.) In 2006, the government put the company up for sale, and it was acquired in March 2007 by Dutch investment company AAC Capital Partners (formerly ABN Amro Capital) and Dutch investor ACP Capital Partners, who each own 50% of the shares. The Dutch state made from the sale. The company became the subject of national media attention and controversy in 2006, when it became known that hundreds of blank passports and identity cards had been stolen from its printing facility in Haarlem. The theft occurred in 2002. Although discovered by Sdu, the company did not report it to the police until 2004, when falsified identity papers made with the blanks began to turn up. Former employees with possible ties to Nigerian organized crime were suspected. In part because of the scandal, Sdu Identification, or Sdu-I, was sold in 2008 to the French company SAGEM, a division of Safran. By 2010 Sdu employed 650 people; in 2008 its revenue was , but revenue in 2011 was only . In 2013, Sdu was taken over by the French publishing company Editions Lefebvre Sarrut, or ELS, which was particularly interested in Sdu's portfolio of fiscal, governmental, and legal books and magazines. Notable publications by the Sdu include the series The Kingdom of the Netherlands During World War II. Design After World War II a concerted effort was made to improve the design of all products; besides printed material, that included the logo. Printer and typographer Jean Fran√ßois van Royen had already condemned the state-printed material as ugly in 1912, and after the war P. Knuttel decided \\"to make everything printed by the government readable and pleasing to the eye\\". One notable designer who learned the trade with the Sdu is Hans Kentie, who worked there in the 1970s; according to Kentie, Anne Vondeling, then President of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands, was adamant that legislation and reports be done in a layout attractive also to the general reader and the bookstore.

In 1991, four organizations: Usines Ephemeres, TransEuropeHalles network, Vecam and Europe 99, combined to create Mains d'≈íuvres. A pioneer of its time, Mains d'≈íuvres spearheaded the widespread phenomenon in Europe during the 1990s, which consisted of turning factories into placed dedicated to new, inventive art forms. A 4000 square metre Mains d‚Äô≈íuvres arts centre opened in Saint-Ouen in 2001. Overview Attributing its outlook to Gilles Deleuze's Difference and Repetition, Mains d‚Äô≈íuvres describes itself as, \\"Sensual and intellectual, specialist and non- specialist...an experimental art space open to everyone.\\" Offering visual and digital arts, music, dance, theater, cinema, lectures and educational events to the public, the organization is supported by the Conseil g√©n√©ral de la Seine-Saint-Denis, Minist√®re de la Culture (France), and the Minist√®re de la Jeunesse et des Sports. Music Mains d‚Äô≈íuvres is most recognized for its offerings in the field of music. Concerts, parties, and residency programs establish the organization on an international field. Residencies are open to a wide range of styles such as electronic, rap, and world music.
