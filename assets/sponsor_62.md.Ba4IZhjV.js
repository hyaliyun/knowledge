Biography  Bonalumi studied technical and mechanical drawing, and exhibited his first works at the \\"Premio Nazionale Citt√† di Vimercate\\" (hors concours) in 1948, when he was just 13 years old. He held his first solo show at the Galleria Totti, Milan, in 1956. In 1958 he began working with Enrico Castellani and Piero Manzoni, holding a group exhibition at the Galleria Pater, Milan, which was followed by further shows in Rome, Milan and Lausanne, the foundation of Azimuth magazine and his participation in exhibitions at the Azimut gallery. He started developing the idea of what he would call \\"pittura ‚Äì oggetto\\" (painting-object), following the idea to go beyond the canvas started by their mentor Lucio Fontana. In 1959 he held his first solo show outside Italy in Rotterdam. In 1960 he was one of the founders of the international Nouvelle √âcole Europ√©enne (NEE) movement in Lausanne and his solo exhibition \\"Agostino Bonalumi. Recent Paintings, Sculptures and Drawings\\" opened at the New Vision Centre Gallery in London. Arturo Schwarz began collecting his works and, in February 1965, organised a Bonalumi exhibition in his gallery in Milan. He had strong links with the German art scene, thanks to the interest of Udo Kultermann in his work (since 1960) and his collaboration with the Galerie M.E. Thelen in Essen. He also had assiduous contacts and links with the international Zero movement (both in the Netherlands and Germany), documented by major exhibitions such as \\"Zero\\" in London, 1964, and the touring exhibition \\"ZERO Avantgarde\\", which began in Lucio Fontana's studio in Milan in 1965. 1965 marked the start of a long period of collaboration with Renato Cardazzo, director of the Galleria del Cavallino in Venice and the Galleria del Naviglio in Milan. He was Bonalumi's sole agent for many years and, in 1973, supervised the publication of a lengthy monograph on the artist by Edizioni del Naviglio, written by Gillo Dorfles. In 1966 he was invited to take part in the 33rd Venice Biennale, where he exhibited a selection of his works in the same room as Paolo Scheggi, while in 1970 he had his own personal room at the 35th Venice Biennale (and a feature written on him in the catalogue by Luciano Caramel), in which he also installed some large environmental sculptures. In 1967 he was invited to the S√£o Paulo Biennial and the Biennial of Young Artists in Paris. This was followed by a period of study and work in northern Africa and America, where he lived for a while in New York. It was here that he held his first solo show in the United States: \\"Agostino Bonalumi. Painting‚ÄìConstructions\\", presented at the Galeria Bonino in 1967. During this period, Bonalumi embarked on his own particular course of painting and environmental sculpture, which unfolded over the decades in some fundamental stages: in 1967, Blu abitabile (Inhabitable Blue) created for \\"Lo spazio dell‚Äôimmagine\\" exhibition in Foligno (and exhibited again in 1970 in the \\"Vitalit√† del negativo\\" show in Rome); in 1968, Grande Nero (Big Black) at the Museum am Ostwall in Dortmund; in 1979, as part of the \\"Pittura Ambiente\\" exhibition curated by Francesca Alinovi and Renato Barilli in the Palazzo Reale in Milan, Dal giallo al bianco e dal bianco al giallo (From Yellow to White and from White to Yellow). More recently, Ambiente bianco ‚Äì Spazio trattenuto e spazio invaso (White Environment ‚Äì Detained Space and Invaded Space), created in 2002 for the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice as part of the \\"Temi e Variazioni\\" project conceived and curated by Luca Massimo Barbero. In 1974, a retrospective of the artist's work, curated by Giulio Carlo Argan, was held in the Palazzo dei Musei in Modena. In 1980, the Regione Lombardia sponsored an exhibition in the Palazzo Te, Mantua, curated by Flavio Caroli and Gillo Dorfles: an extensive review that illustrated his entire artistic career. In 1981 he took part, together with Piero Dorazio, Mimmo Rotella and Giuseppe Santomaso, in the \\"Italian Art: Four Contemporary Directions\\" exhibition at the Fort Lauderdale Museum of Art in Florida. In 1986 he participated in the 11th Rome Quadriennale and the 42nd Venice Biennale. Between 1986 and 1997 Bonalumi was represented exclusively by the Galleria Blu in Milan, which presented solo shows of his work in 1980, 1989, 1991, 1995 (with a monograph published by Scheiwiller as part of the Arte Moderna Italiana series, including a piece written by Vanni Scheiwiller), 2002 and 2005. A monograph by Elena Pontiggia, which documented Bonalumi's works on paper and made from paper, was also published in 1995, as part of La Scaletta editions, San Polo, Reggio Emilia. In 1997 he began working with the Galleria Fumagalli in Bergamo, which, in 1998, held an exhibition of his works from 1957 to 1997, accompanied by a monograph by Alberto Fiz and Marco Meneguzzo. In 1999 he was once again invited to the Rome Quadriennale and, in 2000, a solo exhibition of his opened in the Galleria Niccoli in Parma, which was accompanied by an important monograph by Luca Massimo Barbero. In 2001 he took part in the \\"Materia/Niente\\" group show at the Fondazione Bevilacqua La Masa in Venice and, in the same year, the Accademia Nazionale di San Luca presented him with the \\"Premio Presidente della Repubblica\\" 2001 for sculpture. To mark the occasion, a retrospective of the artist's work was held in the rooms of the Accademia, accompanied by a monograph by Achille Perilli. In November 2003, during the six-month Italian presidency of the EU Council, he took part in the \\"Futuro Italiano\\" exhibition in the rooms of the European Parliament in Brussels. Between 2003 and 2004, the Institut Mathildenh√∂he in Darmstadt dedicated an anthology exhibition to him. He had solo shows in 2008 in the Mazzoleni Galleria d‚ÄôArte, Turin, in 2010 in the Gal√®rie Vedovi, Brussels, and in 2012 in the Barbara Mathes Gallery, New York. In 2011 the Museum of Modern Art in Moscow dedicated a retrospective to the artist, curated by Lea Mattarella. In 2012 his work featured in the \\"Manzoni Azimut\\" exhibition in the Gagosian Gallery, London, devoted to the philological reconstruction of the international activities and context of the historic Milanese magazine and gallery, extensively documented in the book of the same name by Francesca Pola. In 2013, a solo show curated by Silvia Pegoraro was held at the Partners & Mucciaccia Gallery in Singapore. In the course of his career he has also completed some major projects for the stage: in 1970, he designed the scenery and costumes for the Partita ballet (score by Goffredo Petrassi, choreography by Susanna Egri) at the Teatro Romano in Verona, and in 1972 he created the scenery and costumes for Rot (score by Domenico Guaccero, choreography by Amedeo Amodio) at the Teatro dell'Opera in Rome. He also created artist's books for Edizioni Colophon, Belluno, featuring pieces written by himself and by Petrarch, Villa and Goethe. He published ' (twelve poems, Colophon, Belluno, 2000), ' (with a comment by Concetto Pozzati, Book Editore, Castel Maggiore [Bologna], 2001), and ' (Edizioni Il Bulino, Rome 2002). Agostino Bonalumi died in Monza on 18 September 2013. On 4 October 2013, Robilant + Voena Gallery in London presented the first retrospective specifically devoted to his work from the 1950s to the 1970s: \\"Agostino Bonalumi. All the Shapes of Space 1958‚Äì1976\\", curated by Francesca Pola, who also wrote and edited the monograph published on this occasion, and realized a video documentary including Bonalumi's last interview on his work.

With his other brother Otto, he participated in the campaign of Duke Magnus I of Saxe-Lauenburg against the Frisians of Wursten, then an area of free peasant under the loose overlordship of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, which ended in failure in 1499 due to the defense coalition built up by Prince-Archbishop John III.

He developed a technique which he calls Photo Luminism, after noticing an effect created when taking pictures of harbor lights in 2008. The images are created entirely in-camera in a single exposure and with no creative post additions. The abstracted images are hot- printed onto specially treated metal, a process that maximises the appearance of light emanating from within the image, on an entirely flat and mirror-like surface. Commissions for his work can be seen in exclusive hotels around the world. In 2016 Kennedy's proposal for the New Hope Arts Outdoor Sculpture Contest, \\"Exhibitionist,\\" based on three of his Photo Luminism images, was a winner and was subsequently built in opaque fiberglass by Kennedy and his partner Mark Hutzky. The larger than life three-piece sculpture is internally illuminated by almost 2000 animated LEDs. It was installed in New Hope PA in October 2019. Family Kennedy comes from a family of artists. His great grandfather was T. C. Farrer, a Ruskinian painter, who co-founded the American Pre-Raphaelite movement called Society for the Advancement of Truth in Art. Kennedy's nephew is painter Damian Elwes and his sister is the interior designer Tessa Kennedy.

He was the son of Abu Kalijar.  Biography  Upon his father's death, Abu Sa'd Khusrau Shah's brother Abu Nasr Khusrau Firuz took the throne in Baghdad with the title \\"al-Malik al-Rahim\\". His succession to the entire Buyid Empire was prevented by his brother Abu Mansur Fulad Sutun, who took control of Fars. The two then entered into a struggle for supremacy. In 1049, Al-Malik al-Rahim then sent an army under Abu Sa'd Khusrau Shah, who managed to capture Shiraz and also capture Abu Mansur. However, Abu Sa'd Khusrau was shortly forced back to Iraq due to increased hostility between the Turks and the Dailamite troops there. At about the same time, the Buyid lands in Oman were permanently lost. Abu Mansur then managed to become the ruler of Fars once again, and captured parts of Ahvaz from Al-Malik al-Rahim. Al-Malik al-Rahim, however, managed to recapture Ahvaz and seize another town named Askar Mukram from Abu Mansur. The next year, a combined army of Arab and Kurdish tribes, ravaged Ahvaz and its surrounding regions, but were later repelled by Al-Malik al-Rahim. In 1051 or 1052, Al-Malik al-Rahim once again defeated Abu Mansur and captured Fars. He then appointed Abu Sa'd Khusrau Shah as governor of the province. Shiraz, however was lost in 1053 or 1054, when Abu Mansur returned as a vassal to the Seljuk ruler Toghr√ºl. In 1055, a Dailamite military leader named Fuladh, captured Shiraz and repelled Abu Mansur from Fars. Fuladh then made an agreement with Al-Malik al-Rahim where he agreed to acknowledge his authority. However, Al-Malik al-Rahim and Abu Sa'd Khusrau Shah, did not trust him, and along with Abu Mansur, reconquered Shiraz from Fuladh. Abu Mansur then agreed to acknowledge the authority of Al-Malik al-Rahim. Toghr√ºl later made Al-Malik al-Rahim his vassal. However, barely a week had passed, before the citizens of Baghdad began to complain to the amir about looting committed by the Seljuk troops, asking him to expel them out of the city. Toghr√ºl then summoned him to his camp to negotiate over the issue. When he arrived, he was accused of acts of retribution against the Seljuk troops, and was arrested over the caliph's protests. What happened to Abu Sa'd Khusrau after this event is not known, he probably died a few years later.

It includes the Matheson History Museum, the Matheson Library & Archives, the 1867 Matheson House, and the Tison Tool Barn. Museum Complex=Matheson History Museum The Matheson History Museum building, formerly an American Legion Hall and officially opened as a museum in 1994, houses the bulk of the museum complex's exhibitions and programs. The front of the building has a gift shop and a recreation of the Matheson Dry Goods Store that used to exist on Alachua Avenue (now University Avenue). The main gallery consists of a permanent display of local and Florida history along the east wall, with the remainder of the space devoted to rotating temporary exhibitions. The back of the building contains the Mary Ann Cofrin Exhibit Hall, where additional temporary exhibitions are on display. 1867 Matheson House Originally owned and built by the Matheson family, from which the museum takes its name, this house was built in 1867 and is the third oldest house in Gainesville (the Bailey House was completed in 1854 and the Haile Homestead was completed in 1856). It was home to James Douglas Matheson and his wife, Augusta Florida Steele Matheson, daughter of Florida pioneer Augustus Steele (founder of Hillsborough County and Cedar Key). Their son, Christopher Matheson, was Gainesville's longest-serving mayor. Chris's widow, Sarah Hamilton Matheson, deeded to the museum first to the Alachua County Historical Society (of which she was a founding member) and later to the Matheson Historical Center (now the Matheson History Museum). Sarah Matheson, who died in 1996, was one of the original board members and founders of the museum and was also an early president of the Alachua County Historical Society, which originated in 1967 and later merged with the museum under the new name of Alachua County Historic Trust: Matheson Museum, Inc. In 2014, the museum changed its name to the Matheson History Museum. The Matheson House contains original furniture, artwork and artifacts from antebellum and Victorian era Florida. Tison Tool Barn Donated to the museum in 1993, the Tison Tool barn houses the extensive tool collection of John Mason Tison Jr. Originally located on Tison's property, it was entirely deconstructed and rebuilt on the museum grounds. It displays historic tools from various industries ranging from lumber to electrical engineering. Sweetwater Park Located directly behind the museum and maintained jointly by the Matheson History Museum and the City of Gainesville, Sweetwater Park is free and open to the public. Matheson Library and Archives The former Melting Pot restaurant building was restored through a historic preservation grant and private donations and is now the Matheson Library and Archives. Purchased by the museum in the summer of 2014, this building was originally a tabernacle church built in 1933. From 1976 to 1980 retired cardiologist and Matheson co-founder Dr. Mark Barrow and his wife, Mary, operated an antique store in the building. In 1982 they sold the building to Orlando investors, and from 1982 to 2009 it was a Melting Pot fondue restaurant. Originally operated by Hope Meucci, it was one of the first Melting Pot fondue restaurants in the nation. The Matheson History Museum received a $300,000 historic preservation grant from the Florida Department of State, Division of Historical Resources, along with contributions from private donors, to transform the building into a library and archives for the museum's local history collections. The Matheson Library & Archives was completed in 2017. It houses the Matheson History Museum's collections, including local and Florida artifacts, books and vertical files with images and information on a variety of topics in local and Florida history.

The book was written by Australian journalist Hamish McDonald and first published by Allen & Unwin, an Australian publisher, in 1998. The book was never published in India and was banned there.  Creation  McDonald interacted with and interviewed many people who had known Ambani personally, including politicians, businessmen, lawyers and media persons. Some interviewees requested anonymity due to their personal and professional relationship with the Ambani family or to his political influence. The book illustrates Ambani's journey from school teacher's son in Gujarat to a business tycoon. It documents Ambani's influence on politics and some of the allegations made against him.  Indian ban  McDonald expressed surprise that HarperCollins India had even attempted to publish the book. An injunction was taken out against publication in 1998. After the injunction, an expurgated edition, entitled Ambani & Sons, was approved for publication.  Plot  The Polyester Prince follows the journey of a business tycoon Dhirubhai Ambani and his early life, career and how he achieved success in his life. He was the son of a village school master belonging to the modh bania community from Gujarat. Early into his life, due to scarcity of financial resources he dreamed that he needed to become opulent and education in school or college is not directly related to earn money. The family‚Äôs poverty kept him off from contact with members of their social peer group. In 1945 he moved to Junagadh and enrolled in high school. He completed his matriculation in 1949. Due to non availability of funds he was bound to earn his livelihood after matriculation only. In the meantime he learned that life is a web of relationships and obligations. He was pumped up with an ambition and he decided never to become dependent on anyone or to work under someone else for a long period of time.  Struggle  At the age of 16, he was strong enough to mark his later business career. He went to Aden soon after matriculation, following the tradition of Baniya families. In Aden he worked on a monthly salary of rupees 500. His elder brother Ramniklal, had went to Aden two years before and was working in a car sales division of A. Besse & Co. Early in the 1950s, the unit of currency of Aden, Rial was disappearing from circulation. Authorities traced that the coins were disappearing from south to the trading point of Aden, then a British colony and military bastian commanding the entrance to the Red Sea and the south approached to the Suez Canal. Later, it was found that an Indian clerk named Dhirubhai Ambani had an open order out in the souk of Aden. Dhirubhai had noted the value of Rial‚Äôs silver content was higher than its exchange value against the British pound and other foreign currencies. So, he began buying, melting them down and selling the silver ingots in London. After three months, he stopped all these and made a few lakhs. He was assigned to the shell products division of Besse. As he developed more familiarity with the trade, he was sent to market shell and burmah lubricants around the Besse network. He was outgoing, vigorous and helpful to freshers. He had risk taking potential and he was a one who never ponders in taking bold decisions. He was managing the operations shell and was also able to observe construction of the BP oil refinery in Aden.  The great polyester war  In 1960s, 1970s Dhirubhai and Nusli wadia were in partnership business. The business was of fabrics. But through the passage of time and differences in opinions they decided to get separate. After separation Dhirubhai established RIL and Wadia established Bombay Dying. In 1980s the demand for polyester fabrics in India rouse speedily. Through sale of 1 kg of polyester fabric profit of ‚Çπ80-‚Çπ100 was earned by seller. For manufacturing polyester a chemical named DMT was required. Wadia applied to get the license for DMT but it took more than 2.5 years. Whereas due to strong connection with PM, finance minister, president and other big shots politicians Dhirubhai started trading within three months of application. He captured the market before wadia could get a license. In 1985, finance department directed that a letter of credit (LOC) would be given by banks for 90 days and within which industrialists have to repay their amounts. By giving bribes in Canara bank, SBI & Standard chartered Bank Dhirubhai kept his funds rolling by forging, making fake documents and presenting it to government. He was caught several times but in court also by paying to judges and with the help of fake documents he marked himself safe and away from controversies. By doing all these he won the polyester war.  The rise of Dhirubhai Ambani  After polyester war RIL was financially strong enough to enter into stock exchange. RIL registered itself into BSE and within two years RIL worth was 10% in BSE. It was found in 1990's that RIL was issuing duplicate shares making internal profits and was giving a bluff to SEBI. After receiving a notice from SEBI RIL management replied that it wants to deregister itself from SEBI and it will pay back to its investors by issuing more number of shares. SEBI was afraid because of RIL contribution into stock market. And Dhirubhai tackled SEBI in this way. Dhirubhai was a man who knows to build relations. He was backed up with a strong political support. And where he wasn't able to create relations he use to bribe the politicians and gain their support and power. But the politicians of BJP were not in connection of Dhirubhai neither they were corrupt nor Dhirubhai was able to establish personal relations with them. In the elections of 1994 BJP won. The PM, finance minister and ministry of law was observing Dhirubhai and within two weeks of result after election a notice was issued against RIl for violating the companies law, 1956, tax evasions, issuing duplicate share certificates etc. Within 2 weeks due to political issues H.D.Deve Gowda became the new PM and Dhirubhai used his political relations and escaped from conflicts. In 1995 a letter to PM Narasimha Rao was sent by a group of 27 MPs that RIL explanations are not enough. More clarifications are needed. Son of Dhirubhai, Mukesh Ambani addressed the concerned MPs in Delhi and assured that shares switching was a common practice and reasons behind switching the shares were liquidity and tax minimisation on capital gains. UTI went through a survey and found that among top 20 behemoths of India only RIL was opting to switch shares for getting tax benefits and hence Mukesh Ambani's explanation was not wholly convincing. Later SEBI along with IT dept. inquired about scams by RIL. They reported that RCs did not provide them enough supportive documents and are not willing to help them in investigation. In spite of having practical issues and obvious possibility of scams, they did not got evidences against Dhirubhai; so,charges are not upto the mark.  Achievement  Dhirubhai built his company through outstanding abilities and drive on many fronts; as an innovative financer, a determined leader, an astute marketer of his products and as a forward looking industrialist. He was a jolly man, with good sense of humour, and always ready to take risk and challenges. In Spite of having number of cases against him, he was never afraid rather he tackled them gallantly. The dark side of his abilities was an eye for human weakness and a willingness to exploit it. He made a complete mockery of govt. and companies law at a stage when the system was decaying and corrupted already. The ministry of finance and its enforcement agencies, RBI, CBI, SEBI, IT dept. and the company law board proved timid and helpless in front of Dhirubhai's power. But RIL was growing up day by day because of public funds and whatever Dhirubhai had done, but neither he exploited the shareholders of the company nor he misused the funds he just allocated funds through wrong means. Due to immense success and public welfare he was awarded Padma Vibhushan in 2016.

It is caused by the ingestion of the seeds or young shoots of sycamore tree. EAM has a high fatality rate.  Cause  Atypical myopathy is a commonly fatal form of equine rhabdomyolysis caused by the toxin Hypoglycin A (HGA). HGA is a naturally-occurring amino acid contained by trees and shrubs of Sapindaceae family. Horses can become poisoned by eating sycamore seeds or seedlings of Acer pseudoplatanus in Europe and Acer negundo in North America.The amount of HGA in sycamore seeds may vary. The toxin affects to the functioning of horse‚Äôs muscle cells by slowing down or stopping the energy production. Even if atypical myopathy is not contagious it can affect either to individual horse or several horses in the same stock. Some horses may be more resistant to the toxin than others due to genetic differences and different grazing habitats. Changes in weather conditions and temperature may contribute to the propensity of being affected, which is the reason why many cases are reported during autumn and spring.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis can be confirmed by clinical examination and laboratory tests. In most cases treatment needs to be started before getting the laboratory test results as the confirmation of diagnosis may take several days. First symptoms are usually muscular weakness, soreness and stiffness causing problems with walking and breathing. Within hours of first symptoms horse may be unable to stand and in 72 hours of the onset of signs mortalities may occur. The mortality rate of atypical myopathy is high; only 30-40% of affected horses survive. EAM affected horse‚Äôs urine is dark red or brown. Sweating and muscle trembling can be observed while moving. Horses may hang their heads down and be apathetic. Symptoms resemble colic symptoms except that EAM affected horse doesn‚Äôt lose appetite. The body temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate may be normal in some cases.  Prevention  As treatment is still unsuccessful in the majority of cases the main emphasis is on prevention. Risk of atypical myopathy can be reduced by checking pasture for sycamore plants regularly and avoid letting horses graze in pastures where are sycamore trees. In case there are fallen sycamore leaves and seeds in pasture they should be cleaned from the ground. Fresh and clean water should be easily accessible all the time. Keeping the stock size appropriate reduces the risk as there is enough proper grazing for every horse. Taking care of regular vaccinations and anthelmintic treatments decreases the risk. The presence of HGA in pasture can be tested by submitting a sample to laboratory.  Treatment  EAM affected horses are in need of intensive care. There is no antitoxin for HGA but some medications can be used to stop absorption of the toxin. Symptomatic treatment includes intravenous fluid therapy, supplementation of glucose and insulin as well as administration of carnitine, vitamin E, selenium and riboflavin. Anti- inflammatory medication is used to decrease the pain and possibly increase the chance to survive. Supportive therapy includes the regular emptying of the bladder. Affected horse should be kept warm. Horses usually recover completely if they survive the first days after being affected. Recovery may still take several months.

History The monument commemorates all those who died in the city in 1939 to 1945, including participants in the defense of Warsaw in September 1939, the participants of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the Warsaw Uprising, and the victims of German terror in the occupied capital. The decision to erect the monument was taken on July 30, 1956 by the Metropolitan National Council (National Council of the City of Warsaw). It announced in February, 1957 that the first competition had received 196 entries from home and abroad, but it had made no final decision. In January, 1959 there was a second contest, with the participation of the winners and the designers of the winning works from the first contest. Of the 106 entries, the Nike Warsaw sculptor Marian Konieczny won along with architects Zagremmy and Adam Konieczny. The statue shows a reclining woman rising up with a sword raised above her head in her right hand and her left hand also raised. The 10-ton sculpture is seven meters tall and six meters long. On the granite pedestal is the inscription: To the heroes of Warsaw from 1939 to 1945 (Bohaterom Warszawy 1939‚àí1945). The sculpture was cast at the Gliwice Technical Equipment Plant (Gliwickie Zak≈Çady UrzƒÖdze≈Ñ Technicznych S.A.). The biggest challenge was casting the sword weighing about 1000 kg. The special design of steel bars embedded inside it makes it very strong, as, in the wind, the sword can deviate from its position by up to 15 cm. The monument was transported in two parts from Silesia to Warszawa Gda≈Ñska station, north of the site. The monument was unveiled on July 20, 1964 in Theatre Square, in front of the Grand Theatre (where the reconstructed Jab≈Çonowski Palace now stands). The construction of the monument was financed by social contributions and the Social Capital Reconstruction Fund. Relocation In the early 1990s, in connection with the restoration project north of the Theatre Square, it was necessary to move the monument to a new location. On November 14, 1995 the monument was taken down from its pedestal and placed temporarily behind the reconstruction of the Jab≈Çonowski Palace. An adaptation of the monument in its new location was commissioned from its designer, Marian Konieczny. During this work there was a disagreement about the height of the plinth. Marian Konieczny imagined Nike soaring into the clouds, and planned to place the monument on a very high 20-meter pedestal. The authorities disagreed, proposing a pedestal 6.5 meters high. Eventually, a compromise was reached with a plinth height of 14 meters. The new base was designed by Marta Pinkiewicz-Wo≈∫niakowska. Since the monument was to be erected on the slope of an embankment made of rubble, it was necessary to create a deep foundation. The base is made of reinforced concrete imitating natural stone. On December 15, 1997 the sculpture was placed on the new pedestal at its new location.

The primary goal of the research object approach is to provide a mechanism to associate related resources about a scientific investigation so that they can be shared using a single identifier. As such, research objects are an advanced form of Enhanced publication. Current implementations build upon existing Web technologies and methods including Linked Data, HTTP, Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), the Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) and the Open Annotation model, as well as existing approaches for identification and knowledge representation in the scientific domain including Digital Object Identifiers for documents, ORCID identifiers for people, and the Investigation, Study, and Assay (ISA) data model.  Principles and motivation  The research object approach is primarily motivated by a desire to improve reproducibility of scientific investigations. Central to the proposal is need to share research artifacts commonly distributed across specialist repositories on the Web including supporting data, software executables, source code, presentation slides, presentation videos. Research Objects are not one specific technology but are instead guided by a set of principles. Specifically research objects are guided by three principles of identity, aggregation and annotation * Digital identity - Use unique identifiers as names for things, such as DOIs for publications or data, and ORCID ids for researchers. * Data aggregation - Use some form of aggregation to associated related things together that are part of the broader study, investigation etc. so that others may more readily discover those related resources. * Annotation - Provide additional metadata about those things, how they relate to each other, their provenance, how they were produced etc. A number of communities are developing the research object concept. ROSC W3C activity  A W3C community group entitled the Research Objects for Scholarly Communication (ROSC) Community Group was started in April 2013. The community charter states that the goals of the ROSC activity are: \\"to exchange requirements and expectations for supporting a new form of scholarly communication\\" The Community Group aims to produce the following types of deliverables: * Use cases for the representation, publishing, and exchange of research objects on the Web * Requirements and desiderata distilled from the use cases. * A survey of related work on supporting the representation, publishing, and exchange of research objects. * Various best practices and guidelines towards a community- wide practice of sharing, citing, and exchanging of research objects  Github and Figshare  The Mozilla Science Lab have initiated an activity in collaboration with GitHub and Figshare to develop \\"Code as research object\\". The initial proposal of the activity is to allow users to transfer code from a GitHub repository to figshare, and provide that code with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), providing a permanent record of the code that can be cited in future publications.

She is counted as one of the first professional female actors in the Ottoman Empire and thereby the Middle East. In the 1850s, the modern theatre was founded in the Ottoman Empire by an Armenian theatre company. As Muslims did not consider acting a suitable profession, the first actors in the Ottoman Empire was Christian Armenians, and the stigma of the profession was especially the case for females, the actresses received a higher salary than their male colleagues, and they could also continue their careers undisturbed after the Armenian theater monopoly was abolished in the Ottoman Empire in 1879; after this point, male Armenian actors found competition from Muslim Turkish male actors, while no Muslim Turkish female actor ever performed on stage before 1919. She and her college Arousyak Papazian are mentioned by the historian Mikael Nalbandian as two pioneers in defying prejudices by performing on stage. As such, they became publicly visible women in the Muslim Ottoman Empire in a period when the female members of the audience had to watch their plays behind screens. Aghavni Papazian was also historical as the first actress to have performed in Iran, when she appeared on stage in Tabriz. This was, however, before a Christian Armenian audience; the Muslim audience in Tabriz and Iran did not see the performance of an actress until 1888, and in the case of Teheran, not until the performance of Madame Golofin and Madame Babian in 1897.

While some commentators have stated that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) lacks a coherent ideology, the CCP still identifies as a communist party. Ideology In the early days of this party, the prevailing nationalism and populism in 1910s China played an important part in the ideology of early communists such as Li Dazhao and Mao Zedong. On the one hand, Marxism was a spiritual utopia to the early communists, while, on the other hand, they modified or \\"Sinicized\\" some doctrines of communist ideology in a realistic and nationalist way to support their revolution in China. These ideological syntheses led to the emergence of the famous Great Leap Forward movement and the Cultural Revolution. In recent years, it has been argued, mainly by foreign commentators, that the CCP does not have an ideology, and that the party organization is pragmatic and interested only in what works. The party itself, however, argues otherwise. For instance, Hu Jintao stated in 2012 that the Western world is \\"threatening to divide us\\" and that \\"the international culture of the West is strong while we are weak ... ideological and cultural fields are our main targets\\". The CCP puts a great deal of effort into the party schools and crafting its ideological message. Before the \\"Practice Is the Sole Criterion for the Truth\\" campaign, the relationship between ideology and decision-making was a deductive one, meaning that policy- making was derived from ideological knowledge. Under Deng, this relationship was turned upside down, with decision-making justifying ideology and not the other way around. Lastly, Chinese policy-makers believe that one of the reasons for the dissolution of the Soviet Union was its stagnant state ideology. They therefore believe that their party ideology must be dynamic to safeguard the party's rule, unlike the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, whose ideology became \\"rigid, unimaginative, ossified, and disconnected from reality.\\" Role of ideology=Ideals and convictions In the article \\"Revolutionary Ideals are Higher than Heaven-Studying\\" (published in 2013), a person writing under the pen name \\"Autumn Stone\\", supports General Secretary Xi Jinping's policy of strengthening the ideological conviction of party cadres, since (as the Leninist mantra goes) ideological unity leads to party unity. The writer claims \\"Ideals and convictions are the spiritual banners for the united struggle of a country, nation and party, wavering ideals and convictions are the most harmful form of wavering.\\" Adhering to the ideals and convictions of the party creates a link between the party and the masses, and will let the party \\"gain victories wherever\\" it goes. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the core spiritual values of members have become more important than ever, considering the restrengthened position of world capitalism. Xi Jinping believes that wavering conviction in the party's ideals leads to increased corruption and unwanted behaviour. Exemplary members have existed before, such as Xia Minghan who said \\"Don't fear being beheaded, as long as one's ism is true\\", Yang Chao's \\"The heaven's are full of rain, wind and worry, for the Revolution, it is unnecessary to fear losing one's head\\" and Fang Zhimin's statement that \\"The enemy can only cut off our heads, but cannot shake our beliefs!\\" The author suggest that these men were incorruptible because they carried the party's ideals and convictions. The dissolution of the Soviet Union, the writer suggests, was in key parts due to the ideological wavering of officials; claiming that even Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, had acknowledged in private that communist ideals had become obsolete to him. Disintegration in the ideological arena can lead to breaches in other areas of the party's edifice, paving the way for party collapse, the author states. In 2006, at the 16th Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee, the CCP leadership under General Secretary Hu Jintao expressed the need to create a new value system, referred to as the socialist core value system. In his speech, entitled \\"Resolution on Major Issues Concerning the Building of a Socialist Harmonious Society\\", to the 16th Plenary Session Hu Jintao stated; > The guiding ideology of Marxism, the common ideal of the socialism with > Chinese characteristics, the national spirit with patriotism as the core, > the spirit of the times with reform and innovation as the core, and the > socialist concept of honour and disgrace constitute the basic contents of > the socialist core values system. We should persist in integrating the > socialist core values system into the entire process of national education > and the building of a spiritual civilization and having it run through the > various aspect of the modernization drive. Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and Mao Zedong Thought Marxism‚ÄìLeninism was the first official ideology of the Chinese Communist Party, and is a combination of classical Marxism (the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels) and Leninism (the thoughts of Vladimir Lenin). According to the CCP, \\"Marxism‚ÄìLeninism reveals the universal laws governing the development of history of human society.\\" To the CCP, Marxism‚ÄìLeninism provides a vision of the contradictions in capitalist society and of the inevitability of a future socialist and communist societies. Marx and Engels first created the theory behind Marxist party building; Lenin developed it in practice before, during and after the Russian Revolution of 1917. Lenin's biggest achievement came in party- building, through concepts such as the vanguard party of the working class and democratic centralism. According to the People's Daily, Mao Zedong Thought \\"is Marxism‚ÄìLeninism applied and developed in China\\". Mao Zedong Thought was conceived not only by Chairman Mao Zedong, but by leading party officials. According to Xinhua, Mao Zedong Thought is \\"an integration of the universal truth of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution.\\" Currently, the CCP interprets the essence of Mao Zedong Thought as \\"Seeking truth from facts\\": \\"we must proceed from reality and put theory into practice in everything. In other words, we must integrate the universal theory of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism with China's specific conditions.\\" A monument dedicated to Marx (left) and Engels (right) in Shanghai, China While analysts generally agree that the CCP has rejected orthodox Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and Mao Zedong Thought (or at least basic thoughts within orthodox thinking), the CCP itself disagrees. Some Western commentators also talk about a \\"crisis of ideology\\" within the party; they believe that the CCP has rejected communism. Wang Xuedong, the Director of the Institute of World Socialism, said in response, \\"We know there are those abroad who think we have a 'crisis of ideology,' but we do not agree.\\" According to former General Secretary Jiang Zemin, the CCP \\"must never discard Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and Mao Zedong Thought.\\" He said that \\"if we did, we would lose our foundation.\\" He further noted that Marxism in general \\"like any science, needs to change as time and circumstances advance.\\" Certain groups argue that Jiang Zemin ended the CCP's formal commitment to Marxism with the introduction of the ideological theory, the Three Represents. However, party theorist Leng Rong disagrees, claiming that \\"President Jiang rid the Party of the ideological obstacles to different kinds of ownership [...] He did not give up Marxism or socialism. He strengthened the Party by providing a modern understanding of Marxism and socialism‚Äîwhich is why we talk about a 'socialist market economy' with Chinese characteristics.\\" Marxism in its core is, according to Jiang Zemin, methodology and the goal of a future, classless society, not analyses of class and of the contradictions between different classes. Karl Marx argued that society went through different stages of development, and believed that the capitalist mode of production was the third stage. The stages were: ancient, based mostly on slavery; feudal; capitalist; socialist; and the communist mode of production. The attainment of true \\"communism\\" is described as the CCP's and China's \\"ultimate goal\\". While the CCP claims that China is in the primary stage of socialism, party theorists argue that the current development stage \\"looks a lot like capitalism\\". Alternately, certain party theorists argue that \\"capitalism is the early or first stage of communism.\\" In official pronouncements, the primary stage of socialism is predicted to last about 100 years, after which China will reach another developmental stage. Some have dismissed the concept of a primary stage of socialism as intellectual cynicism. According to Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a China analyst, \\"When I first heard this rationale, I thought it more comic than clever‚Äîa wry caricature of hack propagandists leaked by intellectual cynics. But the 100-year horizon comes from serious political theorists\\". Rationale for the reforms and Deng Xiaoping Theory China's nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) trend from 1952 to 2005 While it has been argued by Westerners that the reforms introduced by the CCP under Deng were a rejection of the party's Marxist heritage and ideology, the CCP does not view it as such. The rationale behind the reforms was that the productive forces of China lagged behind the advanced culture and ideology developed by the party- state. In 1986, to end this deficiency, the party came to the conclusion that the main contradiction in Chinese society was that between the backward productive forces and the advanced culture and ideology of China. By doing this, they deemphasized class struggle, and contradicted both Mao and Karl Marx, who both considered that class struggle was the main focus of the communist movement. According to this logic, thwarting the CCP's goal of advancing productive forces was synonymous with class struggle. The classical goal of class struggle was declared by Deng to have been achieved in 1976. While Mao had also emphasized the need to develop productive forces, under Deng it became paramount. Mao Zedong (left) meets with Richard Nixon, the President of the United States, on 29 February 1972 Some have likened the CCP's position under Deng to that of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin when he introduced the planned economy. Adrian Chan, the author of Chinese Marxism, opposes this view: \\"To Stalin, the development of productive forces was the prerequisite for the Soviet Union to become communist.\\" He further argues that such a view does not make sense in light of the different situations; Stalin emphasized production because of the Soviet Union's backwardness in all areas, while in China, the reforms were seen as one way to further develop the productive forces. These interpretations, while not in agreement, shed light on the fact that Chinese socialism did change during the Deng era. In 1987, the Beijing Review stated that the achievements of socialism were \\"evaluated according to the level of the productive forces\\". Party theoretician and former Politburo member Hu Qiaomu in his thesis \\"Observe economic laws, speed up the Four Modernizations\\", published in 1978, argued that economic laws were objective, on par with natural laws. He insisted that economic laws were no more negotiable \\"than the law of gravity\\". Hu's conclusion was that the Party was responsible for the socialist economy's acting on these economic laws. He believed that only an economy based on the individual would satisfy these laws, since \\"such an economy would be in accord with the productive forces\\". The CCP followed his line, and at the 12th National Congress, the party constitution was amended, stating that the private economy was a \\"needed complement to the socialist economy\\". This sentiment was echoed by Xue Muqiao; \\"practice shows that socialism is not necessarily based on a unified public ownership by the whole society\\". The official communiqu√© of the 3rd plenum of the 11th Central Committee included the words: \\"integrate the universal principles of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism‚ÄìMao Zedong Thought with the concrete practice of socialist modernization and develop it under the new historical conditions\\". With the words \\"new historical conditions\\", the CCP had in fact made it possible to view the old, Maoist ideology as obsolete (or at least certain tenets). To know if a policy was obsolete or not, the party had to \\"seek truth from facts\\" and follow the slogan \\"practice is the sole criterion of the truth\\". At the 6th plenum of the 11th Central Committee, the \\"Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China\\" was adopted. The resolution separated Mao the person from Mao Zedong Thought, claiming that Mao had contravened Mao Zedong Thought during his rule. While the document criticized Mao, it clearly stated that he was a \\"proletarian revolutionary\\" (i.e. not all of his views were wrong), and that without Mao there would have been no new China. Su Shaozi, a party theoretician and the head of the Institute of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism‚ÄìMao Zedong Thought, argued that the CCP needed to reassess the New Economic Policy introduced by Vladimir Lenin and ended by Stalin, as well as Stalin's industrialization policies and the prominent role he gave to class struggle. Su claimed that the \\"exploiting classes in China had been eliminated\\". Dong Fureng, a Deputy Director at the Institute of Economics, agreed with the reformist discourse, first by criticizing Marx and Friedrich Engels' view that a socialist society had to abolish private property, and secondly, accusing both Marx and Engels for being vague on what kind of ownership of the means of production was necessary in socialist society. While both Su and Dong agreed that it was the collectivization of agriculture and the establishment of People's Communes which had ended rural exploitation, neither of them sought a return to collectivized agriculture. The creation of a \\"Socialist market economy\\" The term \\"socialism with Chinese characteristics\\" was added to the General Program of the party's constitution at the 12th National Congress, without a definition of the term. At the 13th National Congress, held in 1987, Zhao Ziyang, the CCP General Secretary, claimed that socialism with Chinese characteristics was the \\"integration of the fundamental tenets of Marxism with the modernization drive in China\\" and was \\"scientific socialism rooted in the realities of present-day China\\". By this time the CCP believed that China was in the primary stage of socialism, and therefore needed market relations to develop into a socialist society. Two years earlier, Su had tried to internationalize the term \\"primary stage of socialism\\" by claiming that socialism contained three different production phases. China was currently in the first phase, while the Soviet Union and the remaining Eastern Bloc countries were in the second phase. Because China was in the primary stage of socialism, Zhao argued that in \\"[China] for a long time to come, we shall develop various sectors of the economy, always ensuring the dominant position of the public sector\\". Further, some individuals should be allowed to become rich \\"before the objective of common prosperity [pure communism] is achieved\\". Lastly, during the primary stage of socialism, planning would no longer be the primary means of organization of the economy. Upon hearing this remark, Chen Yun, a cautious reformer and the second-most powerful politician in China, walked out of the meeting. Both Chen Yun and Deng supported the formation of a private market. At the 8th National Congress, Chen first proposed an economy where the socialist sector would be dominant, with the private economy in a secondary role. He believed that by following the \\"Ten Major Relationships\\", an article by Mao on how to proceed with socialist construction, the CCP could remain on the socialist road while also supporting private property. Chen Yun conceived of the bird-cage theory, where the bird represents the free market and the cage represents a central plan. Chen proposed that a balance should be found between \\"setting the bird free\\" and choking the bird with a central plan that was too restrictive. Between the time of the 13th National Congress and the Tiananmen Square incident and the ensuing crackdown, the line between right and left within the CCP became clearer. The rift became visible in the run-up to the 7th plenum of the 13th National Congress (in 1990), when problems arose concerning China's 8th Five-Year Plan. The draft for the 8th Five-Year Plan, supervised by Premier Li Peng and Deputy Premier Yao Yilin, openly endorsed Chen Yun's economic view that planning should be primary, coupled with slow, balanced growth. Li went further and directly contradicted Deng, stating, \\"Reform and opening up should not be taken as the guiding principle; instead, sustained, steady, and coordinated development should be taken as the guiding principle.\\" Deng retaliated by rejecting the Draft for the 8th Five-Year Plan, claiming that the 1990s was the \\"best time\\" for continuing with reform and opening up. Li and Yao even went so far as to try to annul two key resolutions passed by the 13th National Congress: the theory of socialist political civilization, and the resolution that central planning and markets were equals. Deng rejected the idea of reopening discussions on these subjects, and restated that reforms were essential for the CCP's future. Not accepting Deng's stance, party theorist Deng Liqun, along with others, began promoting \\"Chen Yun Thought\\". After a discussion with General Wang Zhen, a supporter of Chen Yun, Deng stated he would propose the abolishment of the Central Advisory Commission (CAC). Chen Yun retaliated by naming Bo Yibo to succeed him as CAC chairman. Indeed, when the 7th plenum of the 13th Central Committee did in fact convene, nothing notable took place, with both sides trying not to widen the ideological gap even further. The resolution of the 7th plenum did contain a great deal of ideological language (\\"firmly follow the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics\\"), but no clear formulation of new policy was uttered. Private ownership of the means of productions were allowed as a result of the reforms. Chen Yun's thoughts and policies dominated CCP discourse from 1989 until Deng's Southern Tour in 1992. Deng began campaigning for his reformist policies in 1991, managing to get reformist articles printed in the People's Daily and Liberation Army during this period. The articles criticized those communists who believed that central planning and market economics were polar opposites, instead repeating the Dengist mantra that planning and markets were only two different ways in which to regulate economic activity. By that time, the party had begun preparing for the 14th National Congress. Deng threatened to withdraw his support for Jiang Zemin's reelection as CCP General Secretary if Jiang did not accept reformist policies. However, at the 8th plenum of the 13th Central Committee, in 1991, the conservatives still held the upper hand within the party leadership. To reassert his economic agenda, in the spring of 1992, Deng made his famous southern tour of China, visiting Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai, and spending the New Year in Shanghai. He used his travels to reassert his economic policy ideas after his retirement from office. On the tour, Deng made many speeches and generated large local support for his reformist platform. He stressed the importance of economic reform in China, and criticized those who were against further reform and opening up. The tour proved that amongst the party's grassroots organizations, support for reform and opening up was firm. Because of this, more and more leading members of the central party leadership converted to Deng's position, amongst them Jiang Zemin. In his speech \\"Deeply Understand and Implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Important Spirit, Make Economic Construction, Reform and Opening Go Faster and Better\\" to the Central Party School, Jiang said it did not matter if a certain mechanism was capitalist or socialist, the key question was whether it worked. Jiang's speech is notable since it introduced the term socialist market economy, which replaced Chen Yun's \\"planned socialist market economy\\". In a later Politburo meeting, members voted unanimously, in old communist fashion, to continue with reform and opening up. Knowing that he had lost, Chen Yun gave in, and claimed that because of new conditions, the old techniques of the planned economy were outdated. At the 14th National Congress, the thought of Deng Xiaoping was officially dubbed Deng Xiaoping Theory, and elevated to the same level as Mao Zedong Thought. The concepts of \\"socialism with Chinese characteristics\\" and \\"the primary stage of socialism\\" were credited to him. At the congress, Jiang reiterated Deng's view that it was unnecessary to ask if something was socialist or capitalist, since the important factor was whether it worked. Several capitalist techniques were introduced, while science and technology were to be the primary productive force. Three Represents Numerous books (as seen in the picture) about the Three Represents have been published. The term ‚Ä≥Three Represents‚Ä≥ was first used in 2000 by Jiang Zemin in a trip to Guangdong province. From then until its inclusion in the party's constitution at the 16th National Congress, the Three Represents became a constant theme for Jiang Zemin. In his speech at the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Jiang Zemin said that \\"[The CCP] must always represent the development trend of China's advanced productive forces, the orientation of China's advanced culture, and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people in China.\\" By this time, Jiang and the CCP had reached the conclusion that attaining the communist mode of production, as formulated by earlier communists, was more complex than had been realized, and that it was useless to try to force a change in the mode of production, as it had to develop naturally, by following the economic laws of history. While segments within the CCP criticized the Three Represents as being un-Marxist and a betrayal of basic Marxist values, supporters viewed it as a further development of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The theory is most notable for allowing capitalists, officially referred to as the \\"new social strata\\", to join the party on the grounds that they engaged in \\"honest labor and work\\" and through their labour contributed \\"to build[ing] socialism with Chinese characteristics.\\" Jiang contended that capitalists should be able to join the Party on the grounds that; > It is not advisable to judge a person's political orientation simply by > whether he or she owns property or how much property he or she owns [...] > Rather, we should judge him or her mainly by his or her political awareness, > moral integrity and performance, by how he or she has acquired the property, > how it has been disposed of and used, and by his or her actual contribution > to the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Scientific Outlook on Development The 3rd plenum of the 16th Central Committee conceived and formulated the ideology of Scientific Outlook on Development. This concept is generally considered to be Hu Jintao's contribution to the official ideological discourse. It is considered a continuation and creative development of ideologies advanced by previous CCP leaders. To apply the Scientific Outlook on Development on China, the CCP must adhere to building a Harmonious Socialist Society. According to Hu Jintao, the concept is a sub-ideology of socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is a further adaptation of Marxism to the specific conditions of China, and a concept open to change. Xi Jinping Thought  Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era consists of a 14-point basic policy, as follows: # Ensuring Chinese Communist Party leadership over all forms of work in China. # The Chinese Communist Party should take a people-centric approach for the public interest. # The continuation of \\"comprehensive deepening of reforms\\". # Adopting new development ideas based on science and for \\"innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development\\". # Following \\"socialism with Chinese characteristics\\" with \\"people as the masters of the country\\". # Governing China with the rule of law. # \\"Practise socialist core values\\", including Marxism, communism and \\"socialism with Chinese characteristics\\". # \\"Improving people's livelihood and well-being is the primary goal of development\\". # Coexist well with nature with \\"energy conservation and environmental protection\\" policies and \\"contribute to global ecological safety\\". # Strengthen national security. # The Chinese Communist Party should have \\"absolute leadership over\\" China's People's Liberation Army. # Promoting the one country, two systems system for Hong Kong and Macau with a future of \\"complete national reunification\\"; and to follow the One-China policy and 1992 Consensus for Taiwan. # Establish a common destiny between Chinese people and other people around the world with a \\"peaceful international environment\\". # Improve party discipline in the Chinese Communist Party. Views on capitalism The CCP does not believe that it has abandoned Marxism. The party views the world as organized into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. They insist that socialism, on the basis of historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Marx wrote that capitalists, in their search for profit, would travel the world in a bid to establish new international markets ‚Äì hence, it is generally assumed that Marx forecasted globalization. His writings on the subject are used to justify the CCP's market reforms, since nations, according to Marx, have little choice in the matter of joining or not. Opting not to take part in capitalist globalization means losing out in the fields of economic development, technological development, foreign investment and world trade. This view is strengthened by the economic failures of the Soviet Union and of China under Mao. Despite admitting that globalization developed through the capitalist system, the party's leaders and theorists argue that globalization is not intrinsically capitalist, the reason being that, if globalization were purely capitalist, it would exclude an alternate socialist form of modernity. Globalization, as with the market economy, therefore does not have one specific class character (either socialist or capitalist) according to the party. The instance that globalization is not fixed in nature, comes from Deng's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism. Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CCP that despite the current capitalist dominance of globalization, globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism. This event will occur through capitalism's own contradictions. These contradictions are, according to party theorist Yue Yi from the Academy of Social Sciences, \\"that between private ownership of the means of production and socialised production. This contradiction has manifested itself globally as the following contradictions; the contradiction between planned and regulated national economies and the unplanned and unregulated world economy; the contradiction between well-organized and scientifically managed Transnational Corporations (TNCs) and a blindly expanding and chaotic world market; the contradiction between the unlimited increase of productive capacity and the limited world market; and the contradiction between sovereign states and TNCs.\\" It was these contradictions, argues Yue Yi, that led to the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, that has caused unbalanced development and polarization, and widened the gap between rich and poor. These contradictions will lead to the inevitable demise of capitalism and the resultant dominance of socialism. Concepts=People's Democratic Dictatorship In 2007, Hu Jintao noted in a speech that \\"people's democracy is the lifeblood of socialism ... without democracy there can be no socialism, and there can be no socialist modernization.\\" To be clear, democracy, in the CCP's understanding of the word, does not mean democracy as practiced in liberal democracies. Instead it means the creation of a more balanced, equal society, \\"with socialism bringing about social justice. The CCP still believes that the Party and country is led by the unity of the peasant and working classes. However, for the further development of democracy and socialism, stability is needed. Yang Xiaoqing in the article \\"A Comparative Study of Constitutional Governance and the People's Democratic Regime\\", published in the party's journal Seeking Truth from Facts in 2013, argues that the people's democratic dictatorship and Western constitutional government are mutually exclusive. She notes, in line with classical Marxist theory, that constitutionalism in general fits with the capitalist mode of production and bourgeois democracy, and does not fit in with China's socialist system of people's democratic dictatorship. Constitutional government has a market economy in which private property plays the predominant role, as the basis unlike the Chinese socialist market economy in which public ownership is the basis. The rallying cries of the liberal revolutions in the 17th and 18th century she notes was \\"Private property is sacred and inviolable, and constitutional governance was established around this premise. While things have changed since the 17th and 18th centuries the basic premise remains the same in Western societies; a small government which protects the interests of private property. =People's democracy versus parliamentary democracy= Yang states that people's democracy, unlike parliamentary democracy, realises the principle of \\"popular sovereignty\\". The basis for the argument is that in a parliamentary democracy, a system in which ordinary people can vote for different parties, the parties available are in the pockets of the bourgeoisie. Parties can only win, Yang claims, if they have enough money‚Äîwhen parties have money, they get it from the bourgeoisie. This relationship turns the political parties contesting the election to subservient tools of the bourgeoisie, and makes them govern in their interest. While a system with multi-party elections, rotational government and parliaments looks more democratic, it is in fact beholden to the interests of the bourgeoisie, and not the people. In contrast, the people's democratic system with People's Congresses realises popular sovereignty through a mixture electoral and consultative democracy. Unlike in parliamentary democracies Yang adds, people standing for elections for seats in people's congresses are state financed, thus giving every candidate an equal chance of getting elected. Yang claims that; > All political parties [in China] bear the trust of the people, all implement > their duties according to the law and under the leadership of the Communist > Party, and serve the people. In a parliamentary democracy, the only way for a party to gain legitimacy is through elections, but due to the involvement of the bourgeoisie in the election process this legitimacy is not considered as genuine. The CCP gained legitimacy, Yang asserts, through its victory in the \\"Chinese democratic revolution\\". Yang claims that the introduction of constitutionalism in any form would lead to the fall of the CCP, and even claims that socialist constitutionalism of the Soviet Union and the former socialist states was a main factor contributing to their downfall. While not writing negatively about the system of checks and balances as it exists in the United States, Yang claims that the people's congress system of \\"one governments and two courts\\" (the institutions of the People's Courts and the People's Procuratorates) is the best suited for Chinese conditions, since it is \\"the best form to reflect our country's national essence.\\" In the people's democratic system, the courts are both responsible to and supervised by the people's congresses. In this system, Yang adds, the judiciary is under the control of the National People's Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee (SC). The NPC (or the SC), are responsible for supervising the implementation of the constitution, and judicial organs are granted judicial independence (through their respective people's congresses). These courts are not subject to interference by groups, individuals and are solely responsible to the people's congresses at their respective level. However, as Yang puts it; > Accordingly, our country's judicial organs, both trial organs and > procuratorial organs, shall implement their powers independently according > to the provisions of the law, but in terms of politics, ideology and > organization, they must be under the leadership of the Communist Party of > China. The Socialist rule of law concept is persisting in 'governing the > country according to the law, a judiciary for the people, fairness and > justice, serving the bigger picture, and the leadership of the Party.' Similarly Yang rejects the constitutionalist notion that the military is to be neutral and nationalized under the control of civilian politician. Since it was established by the CCP, and given its role in the victory against the Kuomintang, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is unique and should be treated as such. =Socialist democracy= In the article \\"Marxism is a Universal Truth, not a 'Universal Value'\\" (published in Party Building in 2013) Wang Ningyou states that democracy is not a universal value since the meaning of democracy (and how it should work) changes from which class perspective one has. He claims that the two main forms of democracy, socialist democracy (proletarian democracy) and capitalist democracy (bourgeoisie democracy) are both diametrically opposite; socialist democracy allows the people to master their own affairs while capitalist democracy, Wang contends, \\"guarantees the freedom of capital to exploit and suppress [the masses/proletariat]\\". The use of qualifiers in front of the word of democracy is important as to highlight the class nature of the different forms of democracy Wang contends, and concludes that \\"One sort of pure democracy, common democracy or 'universal democracy' that all of humanity identifies with has never existed in human societies\\". Under Xi Jinping, the Chinese Communist Party styles itself as a socialist democracy. =Opposition to constitutionalism= Yang rejects the notion that constitutionalism \\"is a good word\\", and rejects the introduction of a term \\"socialist constitutional governance\\" (or another formulation of it) into Chinese ideological discourse. Constitutionalism, Yang believes, has discourse hegemony since it is backed by the bourgeoisie. Similarly to Engels' and Vladimir Lenin's conclusions (among others), Yang concludes that constitutional systems are ruled by property relations which gives the bourgeoisie considerable control. In The Condition of the Working Class in England Engels' states (a position which is still endorsed by the CCP); > Free competition will suffer no limitation, no State supervision; the whole > State is but a burden to it. It would reach its highest perfection in a > wholly ungoverned anarchic society, where each might exploit the other to > his hearts content. [...] However, the bourgeoisie cannot dispense with > government, but must have it to hold the equally indispensable proletariat > in check, it turns the power of government against the proletariat and keeps > out of its way as far as possible. Constitutionalism, and liberal democracy in general (which is continuously referred to as the \\"dictatorship of the bourgeoisie\\" in the article), can be considered \\"superficial\\" Yang argues, since the bourgeoisie are the only one access to true liberty and democracy. Yang notes that \\"constitutional governance asserts that power lies in the people, and implements a parliamentary democratic political system. But the real operation of parliamentary democracies is completely grasped in the hands of the bourgeoisie.\\" Members of parliament (or officials in general) are able to contest elections (and win them) only with the support of the bourgeoisie. He goes on to claim that the elected officials of democratic states fool the people; they pretend to serve the people, \\"but in reality, they dominate and plunder citizens\\". Yang shares Karl Marx's sentiment that liberal democracy \\"permits the oppressed to decide once every few years on which persons from the oppressive class will be represented in parliament to oppress them!\\" The Chinese system is based on Marx's own writings, who write in The Civil War in France that \\"Communes shall not have a parliamentary form, and shall be organs combining executive and legislative work at the same time.\\" The whole points of these elected assemblies are that the people elected to the assemblies are responsible for implementing and supervising laws. Wang contends that the fixed class nature of constitutionalism is bourgeoisie. While there are some who try to separate constitutionalism from the Western capitalist system, Wang argues, by doing so they are only safeguarding the rights of the bourgeoisie and their \\"universal values\\". Constitutionalism is used as a tool by the ruling class (the bourgeoisie) to oppress the labouring masses (the proletariat). Wang reiterates Mao's position of \\"constitutionalism, or what is called democratic politics, in fact is a politics that eats people.\\" Wang concludes his remarks on constitutionalism by claiming that \\"it is [...] necessary to sweep this [concept] into the rubbish bin of history\\". Socialist civilization The term \\"civilization\\" (ÊñáÊòé; Wenming) became a key word during the 1990s. In short, the ideological campaigns tried to harmonize the relationship between the \\"two civilizations\\" in China ‚Äì \\"material civilization and spiritual civilization\\". The concept first developed during the early 1980s from classical Marxist thought. It was through this concept that the CCP called for \\"balanced development\\". \\"Material civilization\\" is synonymous with economic development; \\"spiritual civilization\\", often referred to as \\"socialist spiritual civilization\\", tries to spread good socialist morals in Chinese society. Under Deng, the CCP emphasized material civilization, but under Jiang the emphasis was on spiritual civilization, which was less easily definable. \\"Spiritual civilization\\" changed from a concept largely defined in socialist terminology under Deng into a vehicle for cultural nationalism under Jiang. The theory has become more complex with time; at the 16th National Congress Jiang introduced a third concept of civilization, \\"political civilization\\", focused solely on the CCP and political reform. Deng first used the term in 1979, to denote the need to develop a material civilization as well as a spiritual civilization. Analyst Nicholas Dynon believes it may have been introduced to placate the conservatives within the Party, Deng's way of reassuring them that socialism was not be abandoned. \\"Socialist civilization\\" was to replace class struggle as the main engine of progress, a worldview seen as more harmonious and cooperative. \\"Socialist Spiritual Civilization\\" was launched in the early 1980s to protect the party from foreign, corruptive influences but also to protect the CCP's policy of reform and opening up. While the two terms, \\"material\\" and \\"spiritual\\" civilizations, were added to the party constitution at the 12th National Congress, the terms and their meanings were hotly debated. For instance, Zhao Yiya, the editor-in-chief of the Liberation Army Press, criticized Hua Yaobang's speech to the 12th National Congress, noting that both material and spiritual elements contained \\"class character\\" as well as cultural elements. Material civilization was less contested, and it maintained close links to the Marxist view of economic development and the mode of productions, and the view that the material is the basis of the superstructure. On this, Deng was a classical Marxist who believed that the material served as the basis; \\"when people's material wealth progresses, their cultural aspects will rise as well [and] their spiritual aspects will change considerably\\". Under the banner of spiritual civilization, the CCP would promote patriotic spirit, collectivism and the four haves. By the mid-1980s, Deng became concerned that material civilization was getting more attention than spiritual civilization; he said \\"the one is tough [material civilization] while the other is soft [spiritual civilization].\\" The 6th plenary meeting of the 12th Central Committee adopted the \\"Resolutions on the guiding principles for developing a Socialist Spiritual Civilization\\" under the slogan \\"In grasping with two hands, both hands must be firm\\". Deng's Spiritual Civilization continued using much of the old Maoist vocabulary and slogans, such as \\"five stresses, four goods and three loves\\", \\"study Lei Feng\\" and \\"serve the people\\". However, in a radical break from the past, Deng ended the Maoist emphasis on antagonism and contradiction in Chinese socialist thought. At the 16th National Congress, Jiang introduced a third kind of civilization, political civilization, along with \\"the important thoughts of the Three Represents\\". According to Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a former advisor to the Chinese government, the idea was \\"three interrelated objectives ‚Äî material civilization, spiritual civilization, and political civilization ‚Äî and one unifying mechanism, Three Represents. The three civilizations were the intended ends, and the important thought of Three Represents was the chosen means.\\" There has been talk of introducing a fourth civilization, but nothing has come of it yet. A proposed fourth civilization, social civilization, is linked to Hu's concept of Harmonious Socialist Society. According to Lie Zhongjie, the Deputy Director of the Central Research Office, \\"the outcome of building 'society' in a general sense ... is 'social civilization' ... it is a social civilization in the broad sense, transcending the [other] three civilizations\\". However, social civilization has not been elevated to the same level as the other three kinds of civilization. There are a number of proponents in China for \\"ecological civilization\\", \\"an unsurprising development given the growing awareness and official recognition of China's pressing environmental issues.\\" Socialist modernization A billboard during the preparations for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China Throughout the 20th century, ideology served two functions: first, to achieve the modernization of China, and second, to provide unity where there was fragmentation and struggle. The thought most linked to modernity in early China was Marxism, which analysed different social structures and relations. Mao conceived a Chinese version of Marxism, in which a proletarian revolution was amended to a peasant-dominated revolution. This change gave traction to a utopian modernist view and led to the Chinese Revolution in 1949. The immediate post-1949 consensus was intimately linked with the idea of an \\"alternative modernity that transcended capitalist modernity and its Eurocentric assumptions of historical teleology and economist determinism.\\" The impact of this was in two key areas: the introduction of Marxist terms such as proletariat, bourgeoisie, petit bourgeoisie, capitalist to denote class, for Mao's emphasis class struggle in Chinese society, and the creation of the party-state. The Maoist vision of modernity never \\"enjoyed entire hegemony\\" within the Party, and was always contested even at the height of Mao's power. Zhou Enlai's launching of the Four Modernizations in 1965 (and again 1975) are an example of this. When Mao died, the Four Modernizations replaced class struggle as the Party's key objective. This vision eventually led to the enfranchisement of the private market economy and the establishment of new institutions, and became Deng Xiaoping's \\"socialism with Chinese characteristics\\". This in turn led to the adoption of alternative visions of modernity popular in the Western world. Ideological change led to factional strife, with many leading members of the party calling for a return to the classical socialist model of development. From the outside world these changes may seem odd: a society which looks more capitalist by the day is still ruled by a Party that claims \\"fidelity to socialism\\". However, there is \\"less understanding of how this looks from within\\". A break with the basic tenets of Maoist thought came in the 1990s, when Jiang Zemin talked of the need to let private entrepreneurs join the Party. This decision had a stronger connection to realpolitik then to ideological conviction. By the 16th National Congress, the private sector was one of the most dominant forces in society, a constituency the party could not ignore if it wished to hold on to power. The Party is, in official discourse, directly linked to modernity. For instance, in Hu's speech commemorating the 85th anniversary of the CCP's founding, he said, \\"Only our Party can become the nucleus of power to lead the Chinese revolution, construction, and reform, only it is able to bear the great trust of the Chinese people and the Chinese nationality ... In the last 85 years, our party has preserved and developed the progressive creative line.\\" According to the CCP, the \\"people are the force for creating history\\", and for the CCP to accomplish its task of modernization, it cannot become alienated from the people; it must creatively adapt theory and pursue strategic, sound policies. Therefore, having a correct understanding of Marxism and its development in China is crucial. Hu noted that progressiveness \\"is the essence of Marxist party building\\" and that it is \\"the basic service and eternal theme\\" of Marxism. Socialist patriotism Socialist patriotism is a concept invented by Vladimir Lenin, the informal leader of the Russian Bolshevik Party. It commits people to a non- nationalistic form of devotion to one's country. According to the standard Soviet definition, it means \\"boundless love for the socialist homeland, a commitment to the revolutionary transformation of society [and] the cause of communism\\". To ensure that socialist patriotism did not evolve into a form of nationalism (criticized as a bourgeois ideology), the people had to be committed to proletarian internationalism. The CCP, shortly after seizing power, defined three levels of socialist patriotism. \\"At the first level, individuals should subordinate their personal interests to the interests of the state. At the second level, individuals should subordinate their personal destiny to the destiny of our socialist system. At the third level, individuals should subordinate their personal future to the future of our communist cause.\\" Mao's nationalism was not inclusivist, and people from certain classes were deemed unpatriotic from the outset. Chinese nationalism under Mao was defined as \\"anti-imperialist\\" and \\"anti-feudal\\" in principle. However, Mao believed that nationalism was of secondary importance, and his main aim was to further expand the reach of the world revolution. Under Deng, the concept was further expanded. Believing that purer communist concepts such as class struggle and the like could not bring people together as they had done under Mao, his regime gave patriotism a larger role. In early 1982, the CCP initiated the \\"Three Loves\\" campaign under the slogan \\"Love the party, love socialism, and love the motherland\\". A year later, the Central Propaganda Department and the Central Research Office formulated a comprehensive plan to exploit nationalist feelings by making films and television programs out of China's \\"heroic struggle against Western and Japanese imperialism\\". \\"Patriotic activities\\" were added to the school system's extracurricular activities; the national flag was to be raised daily and pupils were to sing and learn the national anthem. By 1983, the party had concluded that \\"among patriotism, collectivism, socialism, and communism, patriotism has peculiar features and functions. [...] Patriotism is the banner of greatest appeal.\\" Despite its broadened role, patriotism remained secondary to socialism. As Deng put it, \\"Some have said that not loving Socialism is not the same as not loving one's motherland. Is the motherland something abstract? If you do not love socialist New China led by the Communist Party, what motherland do you love?\\" According to official pronouncements, the CCP was the best representative of the nation, communists were the most devoted patriots, and socialism the only viable road for China to become \\"a great nation\\". Deng Liqun, in a similar vein, said, \\"One cannot demonstrate that one loves the motherland if one shows no deep love for the socialist system and the Communist Party. In short, in our times, loving the Chinese Communist Party is the highest expression of Chinese patriotism.\\" Economics=Productive forces vs. superstructure According to China scholar Maria Hsia Chang, Deng Xiaoping was \\"in a very real sense, a better Marxist theoretician than Mao Zedong.\\" Deng had studied Marxism in the Soviet Union, unlike Mao who never studied Marxism in depth before the 1930s, in the 1920s at the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University, enrolling in a course on historical materialism and Marxist economics. Like Mao, Deng never referenced Marxism when articulating new policies, however, the few times the pair did, Deng displayed a more advanced grasp of Marxism than Mao ever did. To take one example, in 1975 in \\"On the General Program of Work of the whole Party and the Whole Nation\\", Deng wrote; > Marxism holds that, within the contradictions between the productive forces > and the relations of production, between practice and theory, and between > the economic base and the superstructure, the productive forces ... and the > economic base generally play the principal and decisive role ... Whoever > denies this is not a materialist. This position, while being based on Marxism, was criticized by Maoists at the time of being the \\"revisionist theory of the productive forces.\\" In a break with classical Marxism, Mao argued that the superstructure should play the leading role in the revolution, that is the political system and individuals, and not the materialist forces, which Mao considered secondary. This was not a small ideological issue, and had been in the heart of Marxist theoretical debate since the era of Vladimir Lenin. Lenin had argued that socialist revolutions could occur in the peripheries of capitalism, that is countries not economically advanced enough to develop socialism according to Karl Marx, since these revolutions could instigate a revolutionary wave in the more advanced countries. Marx, in The Poverty of Philosophy, stated that \\"in acquiring new productive forces, men change their mode of production; and in changing their mode of production, in changing their way of earning a living, they change all their social relations.\\" To explain, Marx believed as the productive forces, literally the economic forces, changed social relations would change, and when the social relations changed, something new would develop. In short, the Marxist founders argued that the socialist mode of production could only develop out of a developed capitalist economy, and not from a backward economy, developing it on a backward area was, according to Marx, a \\"chiliastic dream fantasy.\\" After the failure of the revolutionary waves of the late-1910s, early 1920s, Lenin initiated the New Economic Policy, a series of policies which reintroduced capitalist economics in the country in a bid to develop socialism in Russia despite its backwardness. According to Maria Hsia Chang, Mao never grasped the central importance of the productive forces in developing socialism, and he argued until the end that socialism could be created through the superstructure alone with \\"revolutionary commitment, political intransigence, personal sacrifice, and selfless dedication [to the revolution].\\" Deng, on the other hand, staid true to classical Marxism, arguing until his death that the productive forces played the central role. The basic conflict between the Maoists and the Dengists was if China after 1949 had reached socialism or not, and what it would entail. In the aftermath of the Great Leap Forward and the Sino‚ÄìSoviet split Mao himself, was even unsure if China had reached the socialist mode of production. In 1962 he reached the conclusion that China, despite having nationalized the means of production, had not reached the socialist mode of production in its mature form, claiming that the principle conflict as existing in China was between the proletariat and the \\"new bourgeois elements\\", which were constantly reproduced, and other enemies of the revolution. This view led Mao to introduce to the Cultural Revolution. Unlike Mao, who gave priority to superstructural elements, Deng argued in 1956 in the \\"Report on the Revision of the Constitution of the Communist Party of China\\", that socialism had taken root in socialism, since private property had been abolished, since nationalization of property Deng argued (again following the basic premises of classical Marxism) entailed removing the basis of other classes reproducing, stating; > Casual labourers and farm labourers have disappeared. Poor and middle > peasants have all become members of agricultural producers' co-operatives, > and before the distinction between them will have become merely a thing of > historical interest ... The vast majority of our intellectuals have now come > over to the side of the working class ...

What is the point, then, of classifying > these social strata into two different categories? And even if we were to > try to devise a classification, how could we make it neat and clear-cut? In contrast to Mao, Deng argued that the principal contradiction in Chinese society was the backwardness of the productive forces, further adding that the Party's \\"central task\\" over the coming years were to develop them. In addition he believed that China, since 1957, had been unable \\"to figure out what socialism is and how to build it\\". He criticized Mao's policies, particularly those after 1957, arguing that the CCP had \\"wasted twenty year.\\" Primary stage of socialism The concept of a primary stage of socialism was developed mainly by Xue Muqiao and Su Shaozi. The concept began to evolve when the new post-Mao leadership of Deng began questioning Mao' assertion that \\"class struggle as the key link\\". Su, coauthoring with Feng Langrui, published an article in Economic Research () in 1979 which called into question the Chinese socialist project by using Marxist methodology. The article analyzed the basis of Chinese socialism by looking at Karl Marx's writings; Marx drew a distinction between lower-stage communism (commonly referred to as the socialist mode of production) and higher-phase communism (often referred to as simply communism). Su's and Feng's article created three subdivisions within the socialist mode of production; the first phase was the transition from the capitalist mode of production to the socialist mode of production; which was (a) the phase in which the proletariat seized power and set-up the dictatorship of the proletariat and (b) in which undeveloped socialism was created, the second phase was advanced socialism (the socialism of which Marx wrote about). They argued that China was an undeveloped socialist nation since; > The characteristics of undeveloped socialism are the two forms of public > ownership, commodity production and commodity exchange. Capitalists have > been basically eliminated as a class but there are still capitalist and > bourgeois remnants, even feudal remnants. There also exist quite a few small > producers, class differences among workers and peasants ... and the force of > habit of small-scale producers. The production forces are still not highly > developed. And there is not an abundance of products. ... Therefore, the > transition toward socialism has not yet been completed. The concept of a primary stage of socialism led directly to the reconception of capitalism and socialism's polar-opposite relation to each other. Previously, the CCP had declared that supporting capitalism meant supporting an historical retreat, secondly, capitalism was considered the diametrical opposite of socialism and their relations were considered hostile and incompatible. The official reconception of the two terms were sanctioned in the Political Report to the 13th National Congress. Before the reform efforts, capitalism and socialism were believed to be part of a sequential relationship, with the latter developing from the former. A less traditional view was that capitalism had proven it had a \\"greater capacity for creating human civilization\\" than Marx expected, which indirectly meant that socialism could learn from capitalism. Another mark of continuity was that the two systems existed alongside each other. Role of the market Deng did not believe that the fundamental difference between the capitalist mode of production and the socialist mode of production was central planning versus free markets. He said, \\"A planned economy is not the definition of socialism, because there is planning under capitalism; the market economy happens under socialism, too. Planning and market forces are both ways of controlling economic activity\\". Jiang Zemin supported Deng's thinking, and stated in a party gathering that it did not matter if a certain mechanism was capitalist or socialist, because the only thing that mattered was whether it worked. It was at this gathering that Jiang Zemin introduced the term socialist market economy, which replaced Chen Yun's \\"planned socialist market economy\\". In his report to the 14th National Congress Jiang Zemin told the delegates that the socialist state would \\"let market forces play a basic role in resource allocation\\". At the 15th National Congress, the party line was changed to \\"make market forces further play their role in resource allocation\\"; this line continued until the 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee), when it was amended to \\"let market forces play a decisive role in resource allocation\\". Despite this, the 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee upheld the creed \\"Maintain the dominance of the public sector and strengthen the economic vitality of the State-owned economy\\".  Cultural and societal views =Stance on religion The CCP, as an officially atheist institution, prohibits party members from belonging to a religion. Although religion is banned for party members, personal beliefs are not held accountable. During Mao's rule, religious movements were oppressed, and religious organizations were forbidden to have contact with foreigners. All religious organizations were state-owned and not independent. Relations with foreign religious institutions were worsened when in 1947, and again in 1949, the Vatican forbade any Catholic to support a communist party. On questions of religion, Deng was more open than Mao, but the issue was left unresolved during his leadership. According to Ye Xiaowen, the former Director of the State Administration for Religious Affairs, \\"In its infancy, the socialist movement was critical of religion. In Marx's eyes, theology had become a bastion protecting the feudal ruling class in Germany. Therefore the political revolution had to start by criticizing religion. It was from this perspective that Marx said 'religion is the opium of the people'.\\" It was because of Marx's writings that the CCP initiated anti-religious policies under Mao and Deng. The Marxist view that religion would decline as modern society emerged was proven false with the rise of Falun Gong. The popularity of Falun Gong, and its subsequent banning by state authorities, led to the convening of a three-day National Work Conference for Religious Affairs in 1999, the highest- level gathering on religious affairs in the party's history. Jiang Zemin, who had subscribed to the classical Marxist view that religion would wither away, was forced to change his mind when he learnt that religion in China was in fact growing, not decreasing. In his concluding speech to the National Work Conference, Jiang asked the participants to find a way to make \\"socialism and religion adapt to each other\\". He added that \\"asking religions to adapt to socialism doesn't mean we want religious believers to give up their faith\\". Jiang ordered Ye Xiaowen to study the classical Marxist works in depth to find an excuse to liberalize the CCP's policy towards religion. It was discovered that Friedrich Engels had written that religion would survive as long as problems existed. With this rationale, religious organizations were given more autonomy.  Stance on Chinese traditions  The CCP is historically notorious for attempting to destroy aspects of Chinese culture, mainly folk Confucianism in the form of Four Olds under Mao. This attitude has reversed under later leaders, culminating in Xi Jinping's open embrace of Confucianism as \\"the cultural soil that nourishes the Chinese people\\" and the addition of \\"cultural confidence\\" in the confidence doctrine. On the other hand, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has always been endorsed by the CCP. While Mao valued TCM's use as a low-cost way to improve rural health, Xi's preference is more based on cultural concerns.

Overview of the result 1889 was a landmark year in the history of Welsh Liberalism, a coming of age symbolized by the triumph across Wales of Liberal candidates in the inaugural county council elections. The Liberal triumph in Pembrokeshire was not as complete as in other Welsh counties but was nevertheless significant. In the north of the county a number of landed gentry were defeated including James Bevan Bowen of Llwyngwair, former MP for the county of Pembrokeshire.

He is found in the Talmud and Midrash. B. Sukkot 52b According to Simeon Hasida, Zechariah's Four Craftsmen are Messiah ben David, Messiah ben Joseph, Elijah and the Righteous Priest. In the oldest full manuscript of the Talmud dating from 1342, known as the Munich Talmud, the Righteous Priest is referred to as Melchizedek. In his commentary on the Talmud, Rashi says the Shem/Melchizedek is called a craftsman because he helped his father build the ark and taught Abraham. In 1280, following the Disputation of Barcelona, the Roman Catholic Church forced Jews to censor parts of the Talmud that were theologically problematic. The Talmud was censored again in 1564 following the invention of the printing press. Numerous times between 1239 and 1775, all copies of the Talmud were ordered destroyed; few survived. Shem According to Avot of Rabbi Natan on Gen. i 27, Adam was born circumcised because he was created in the image of God. While they were in Egypt, the children of Israel were not circumcised because they wished to follow the customs of the Egyptians. The Israelites lived in Egypt for 210 years. According to Midrash Rabbah LVII. 4, Satan denounced Israel when they were in Egypt. Generally this is interpreted as happening after Joseph died and was because they stopped practicing circumcision. However the priestly tribe of Levi practiced circumcision in Egypt. Entry into the land of Israel required the circumcision of all the tribes. Noah the second Adam was also born circumcised. Noah's son Shem likewise was born circumcised. Although Shem is unanimously declared by the Rabbis to have been the youngest son of Noah, he is always named first, being the most important of the three brothers. He was the ancestor of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; he was also a priest, a prophet, and one of the eight righteous mentioned twice in Genesis xi 10; they were allotted a portion both in this world and in the world to come. Shem is styled \\"the great one\\" According to Genesis R. xxx. 6, it was Shem who offered the sacrifices on the altar after Noah came out of the ark, because Noah, having been crippled by a lion, was unfit for the priestly office. Noah gave the priestly garments, which he had inherited from Adam, to Shem. Shem is extolled by the Rabbis for his filial devotion in covering his father's nakedness. Although his brother Japheth helped in this act, Shem suggested and began it; his brother did not arrive on the scene until Shem was already on his way with the garment. Noah, in blessing these two sons said, \\"blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem\\", giving special significance to Shem because Shem would be the forefather of the Jewish people. Melchizedek as Shem Melchizedek occupied an important place in ancient Judaism. In one of the Dead Sea scrolls 11Q13, he is presented as a semi-divine being. Josephus referred to Melchizedek as the first priest and as a Canaanite chief. Many scholars now believe that Israelite beliefs were an evolution of Canaanite beliefs. In Samaritan tradition, Melchizedek's city was near the temple on Mount Gerizim. Josephus followed the Jewish tradition and linked Salem with Jerusalem and Mount Zion. The name Melchizedek translates as \\"king of righteousness\\". He also had priestly duties. Based on biblical life spans in the Masoretic text, Shem would have still been alive during Abraham's lifetime. The identification of Shem as Melchizedek is found in the Talmud, Targumim and Midrashim. Many Christian sources have said Shem was associated with Melchizedek for anti- Christian reasons . He was probably already associated with priesthood‚Äîif not Melchizedek‚Äîin pre-rabbinic times. Targums Targum Neofiti, Targum Pseudo- Jonathan, Targum Fragment P, Targum Fragment V all identify Shem as Melchizedek. The Book of Jubilees also says Shem was linked with priesthood. Similarly, Philo‚Äôs writings exalt Shem. None of these documents contain antichristian polemics. It is not known when Shem became associated with Melchizedek. By the fourth century CE, the identification of Shem with Melchizedek was well established. This was not limited to Jewish sources; Ephrem the Syrian also identifies Melchizedek as Shem. Early sources in chronological order *The poly-messianic Testimonia text 4Q175 presents a prophet similar to Moses, a messianic figure and a priestly teacher. It is dated to the early 1st century BCE. *1QS lists a Messiah of Israel, a prophet and a priestly Messiah of Aaron. 1QS dates from around 100 BCE. *Babylonian Talmud Sukkah 52b presents the Four Craftsmen. Each may have a role to play in the ushering in the messianic age they are listed as Elijah, Messiah ben David, Righteous Priest and Messiah ben Joseph. *Pesikta de-Rav Kahana 5.9 here the four craftsmen are listed as Elijah, the King Messiah, Melchizedek and the Anointed for War. *Avot of Rabbi Natan states that Messiah ben David is more beloved then the Priest of Righteousness it cites Psalm 110 linking the Priest of Righteousness with Melchizedek. *Song of Songs Rabbah also lists the four craftsmen. Here they are listed as Elijah, the King Messiah, Melchizedek and the Anointed for War. *Pesikta Rabbati 15.14/15 likewise the four craftsmen are listed as Elijah, the King Messiah, Melchizedek and the Anointed for War. *In Tanna Devei Eliyahu the four craftsmen are listed the same as in the Talmud as Elijah, Messiah ben David, Righteous Priest and Messiah ben Joseph. *Rashi referred to the Righteous Priest as Shem/Melchizedek in his commentary on the Talmud. *Numbers Rabbah 14.1 here the Righteous Priest has been replaced. The four craftsmen are listed as Elijah, Redeemer from David, War Messiah from Ephraim, Messiah from Manasseh. *Yalkut Shimoni 569 lists the four craftsmen as Elijah, Messiah ben David, Righteous Priest and Messiah ben Joseph. *Melchizedek takes the place of the Righteous Priest in the Munich Talmud. The oldest full manuscript of the Talmud dating from 1342. Later writings In Judaism, Shem and Melchizedek are one and the same. Shem plays an important role throughout Jewish literature beyond the role of the Righteous Priest. He is especially prominent in Kabbalah. Kabbalah=Ecstatic Kabbalah Abraham Abulafia was the founder of Ecstatic Kabbalah. He identified Jesus as the Messiah ben Joseph, referring to him as ‚Äúthe sixth day‚Äù and as Satan. Abulafia linked Jesus with the month of Tammuz, the month of the sin of the golden calf. Abulafia referred to himself as ‚Äúthe seventh day‚Äù and the true Messiah ben David. He claimed to be both the Messiah ben David and a Kohen like Melchizedek. He supported this by claiming his father was of Judah, his mother of Levi, and his wife of the Kohen. He also identified himself as the priestly angel Metatron. Lurianic Kabbalah In Lurianic Kabbalah, Adam incorporated all souls; it is possible for different soul-sections to be given to different people. In addition, multiple people can share the same soul root. In the Kabbalistic understanding, the Righteous Priest would be reincarnated as Abel, Seth, Noah, and Shem. Moses like Adam also incorporated all souls. Messiah ben Joseph was incarnated as Cain; he was also reincarnated as Jacob's son Joseph and Jeroboam. Messiah ben David was incarnated as Abel and David.

Early life and military service Brownlow was born in Portaferry, County Down. He was the son of Colonel Guy Brownlow and Elinor Scott, the daughter of Colonel George Scott. He was educated at Eton College before joining the British Army following the outbreak of the Second World War. He was commissioned into his father's former regiment, the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own). Over the course of the war, Brownlow was wounded and Mentioned in Despatches three times. He retired from the military with the rank of major in 1954. He was awarded the rank of Honorary Colonel in 1973 in the Northern Irish Militia, part of the Royal Irish Rangers. Politics He held the office of Justice of the Peace for County Down in 1956 and was High Sheriff of Down in 1959. Brownlow was Deputy Lieutenant of County Down in 1961 and was an Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) member of the Down County Council between 1970 and 1973. He was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly for North Down as a pro-Sunningdale UUP candidate in 1973 following the Sunningdale Agreement, but Parliament never assembled. In 1975, he stood as the Unionist Party of Northern Ireland (UPNI) candidate for North Down in the Constitutional Convention Election, but failed to be elected, being defeated by a coalition of Anti-Assembly Unionists. Brownlow stood for North Down's Westminster seat in the October 1974 general election for the UPNI, but lost to the UUP. Personal life Brownlow married Eveleigh, the daughter of Lieutenant Colonel George Panter, on 11 January 1961. Together they had three children: *James George Christy Brownlow (born 20 September 1962) *Camilla Jane Brownlow (born 29 July 1964) *Melissa Anne Brownlow (born 8 May 1968) In his spare time, Brownlow was a leading practitioner of fox hunting, in which circles he was known as \\"The Major\\". Following his death, a Brownlow Trophy was instituted for the person who had made the \\"greatest contribution to country sports and conservation in Ireland\\" each year.Irish Countrysports and Country Life Magazine, Autumn 2011, p.136 During the 1960s, Brownlow used an amphibious car to cross Strangford Lough to visit his fox hounds, stopping only when he persuaded local councillors to introduce the Portaferry - Strangford Ferry service.

In the 1950s, a time when the post World War II population was exploding and in need of housing, he built and sold thousands of one-family homes, primarily in Minnesota. He contributed significantly to the creation of the mode of life in the twentieth century that became known as the suburb.Kenney, Dave. Wackman, Hillary. Wagner, Nancy O'Brien. Northern Lights: The Stories of Minnesota's Past. Minnesota Historical Society Press. 2003. Page 300.  Building plans, methods and growth  Thompson and his company, Orrin Thompson Homes, built rows and rows of modestly priced new homes that were termed subdivisions or tract housing. He then offered them to the generation known as the Greatest Generation. To keep his prices down, he saved on building costs in a number of ways: by taking ideas from the assembly line, by creating great quantities of houses, by building them in proximity to each other, and by using the same plans over and over. In the 1950s these newly built homes were priced around $12,000.Gerloff, Robert. Johnson, Kristi. Must, Peter J. Cape Cods and Ramblers; a Remodeling Planbook for PostWWII Houses. Also, Thompson was able to build on inexpensive land away from the city, because the automobile and the public streets and highways had come of age, which gave homeowners greater mobility and the ability to commute. Beginning with a few acres of prairie, Thompson created entirely new communities; first each basement would be excavated and constructed of cinder blocks, then each house would be erected on top of that, then the new family would move in. Lawns were then planted. The next step would be the addition of sewer systems, natural gas pipelines, then asphalt streets. The communities grew, accompanied by the development of businesses and schools, and in some cases communities developed into cities where there had been no cities.Beauregard, Robert A.

House design  An Orrin Thompson ranch style house His typical house design was known as the rambler, or the ranch-style house; a modest one family house. Its style borrowed modern ideas that had been developed by Frank Lloyd Wright and the Prairie School. The design emphasized horizontality, large windows, a relatively flattened roof, and eaves that extend like the brim of a hat. The prototype of this style is Wright's first independent commission, with its innovative design: the William H. Winslow House of River Forrest, Illinois built in 1893.Samon, Katherine.

Minneapolis - St. Paul Star Tribune. 18 February 2006 A prototype of design elements: Frank Lloyd Wright's William H. Winslow House (1893) in River Forest, Illinois  Biography  Orrin Thompson grew up on the family farm near the town of Barrett, Minnesota. He believed that he would have become a farmer, had not the Great Depression forced him to take on other kinds of work. First, he became an electrician, and then during World War II he found employment in factories in the midwest. He also worked in his brother's electric shop in south Minneapolis.History of Thompson Plumbing. When the war ended, he observed that Minnesota was having a housing crisis: Soldiers were coming home, finding few places to live and were forced to move in with relatives, or into cramped apartments, or into the metal housing structure known as the Quonset hut. Adding to the demand for housing was the G.I. Bill, which offered veterans assistance and encouragement to purchase homes. Thompson saw this situation as an opportunity, and began building his first houses in a rural area south of Minneapolis. Considering that his name was attached to all of his houses, there were almost no photographs taken or displayed of him, except for one that shows him standing in front of some of his first houses.Photo of Orrin Thompson standing in front his first houses in Minneapolis. Orrin Thompson houses, Copyright 2002 Star Tribune/Minneapolis St. Paul.  Criticism  The 1950s style of suburban real-estate development is mocked by Pete Seeger in the 1962 song ‚ÄúLittle Boxes‚Äù, and it is criticized for contributing to urban sprawl, a phenomenon which results in diminished woods and prairie.Blackwell, Jon. 1951: American dream houses, all in a row.

Reilly in 2010 published The Closing of the Muslim Mind, published by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. In the book, he draws a connection between the decline of the \\"rational\\" theological school of Mu'tazila in favour of the rise of Ash'arism, which would become the mainstream Sunni theology, in the 10th century. In this the author sees an act of \\"intellectual suicide\\", the nucleus of the end of the Islamic Golden Age and the decline of Islamic civilization into a \\"dysfunctional culture based on a deformed theology\\" locked in determinism, occasionalism and ultimately fatalism. In his review of the book, Frank Griffith describes it as \\"war literature\\", and \\"a Catholic refutation of Ash'arite Muslim theology\\", complaining that Reilly constructs an undue equation between Ash'arism and contemporary Jihadism, while most Jihadists in fact follow Salafism and are hostile towards Ash'arism.Frank Griffe, Review of Reilly's Closing of the Muslim Mind in American Journal of Islamic Social Sciences 28:4 (2011), Association of Muslim Social Scientists of North America and International Institute of Islamic Thought.

He was a member of the Wisconsin State Senate and the Wisconsin State Assembly. Biography Conkey was born in Canton, New York, son of Asa Conkey and Mary Nash. His father was a farmer, and had served in the U.S. Army during the War of 1812. He left his father's farm in 1841, moving first to Fond du Lac, in the Wisconsin Territory, then settling for a year in Madison, where he taught school. He returned to Fond du Lac and took up a new career in civil engineering, where he conducted U.S. government surveys of land in Wisconsin. As a surveyor, he apprenticed under Albert Gallatin Ellis, who had been surveyor general of the Wisconsin and Iowa district. Together, they surveyed large tracts of northern Wisconsin. Conkey determined that the Grand Chute rapids would provide an ideal source for water-power, and in early 1849, in partnership with Morgan Lewis Martin and Abraham B. Bowen, they selected a tract of land on the north side of the Fox River to start a village. Conkey surveyed and platted the land where the city would be built, and in July 1849, moved his family to the area, becoming one of the original pioneers of Appleton, Wisconsin. Conkey constructed a saw mill, and performed contract construction projects in the area. He was invested in improvements on the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers, partnering again with Morgan Lewis Martin. In 1861, at news of the outbreak of the American Civil War, Conkey sold his mill and decided to help raise a company of men for the Union Army. His volunteers were incorporated into the 3rd Wisconsin Volunteer Cavalry Regiment as Company I, and Conkey was named Captain of that company. The regiment was attached to the Army of the Frontier and served almost the entire war in Missouri, Kansas, and Arkansas. He mustered out of the service as lieutenant colonel of the regiment a few months after the close of the war. He returned to Wisconsin November 1865 and resumed the milling business, investing with Charles Pfennig. On his partner's death, Conkey bought out the other investors. He invested in enlarging and improving the mill, and was involved in running it until 1879, when he sold to Kimblerly, Clark & Co. Conkey effectively retired from business after this sale. An Episcopalian, Conkey married Cynthia F. Foote in June 1848. They had four children, three survived to adulthood. Political career Conkey was a member of the Wisconsin Senate from 1851 to 1852. Perhaps his most important legislative contribution in the Senate was his act in 1851 to split off the western part of Brown county and create a new county named \\"Outagamie.\\" Conkey later represented Outagamie county in the Wisconsin Assembly in 1857. He also served on the Appleton City Council and on the Outagamie County Board. He was a Democrat.

She wrote an influential gardening advice column and was a major collector of plants endemic to the Carolinas.  Early life and education  Born in St. Thomas Parish, South Carolina, on 29 December 1704, to a wealthy family. She was the daughter of Robert Daniell and Martha Wainwright. Her father, Robert Daniell, was appointed to two terms as South Carolina's lieutenant governor and was a prominent merchant. Martha Daniell was taught to read and write by a private tutor. After her father's death in 1718, Martha Daniell inherited his property along the Wando River. In 1719, Martha married George Logan, Jr. Over the next sixteen years, she gave birth to eight children, six surviving to adulthood. The Logans moved from their Wandon home to a plantation near Charleston, South Carolina, and began her botanical collections in the nearby woods.  Career  After her husband died in 1742, Martha experienced financial difficulties. In 1742, Martha placed an advertisement in the South Carolina Gazette, offering to board children and teach them to read and write. Her son Robert began to advertise imported seeds, flower roots, and fruit stones, sparking further interest into horticulture. In 1751, Martha wrote a column titled \\"Gardener's Kalendar\\" for the South Carolina Gazette. Though further financial trouble caused her to have to sell her plantation in 1753. Martha moved to Charleston and sold rare seeds and roots and delved more seriously into her studies of botany. She continued to collect plants, seeds, and other botanical materials, and also began to correspond extensively with the royal botanist at the time, John Bartram. Bartram, stationed in Philadelphia, exchanged samples and communicated regularly with Logan. Logan died in Charleston at the age of 75, on the 28 June 1779.

The show replaced Gateway to Hollywood, which the company had sponsored. An item in the January 1, 1940, issue of Broadcasting magazine reported that the program \\"will feature Gene Autry, singing cowboy, and dramatics\\" and that it would be carried on 67 CBS stations.New Wrigley Series, Broadcasting, January 1, 1940, p.24, bottom rightFrancis Chase, Jr., Radio's Richest Cowboy, Radio Guide, November 17, 1939, front cover, pp. 4,5 Format Centering on the talent and popularity of the star, singing cowboy Gene Autry, each episode of the program \\"consisted of a Western adventure interspersed with interludes of music.\\"Buxton, Frank and Owen, Bill (1972). The Big Broadcast: 1920-1950. The Viking Press. SBN 670-16240-x. P. 96. John Dunning, in his reference book, Tune in Yesterday, summarized the format as follows: > His own show changed little over the years. It featured a slightly > sophisticated version of his 1929 act‚ÄîAutry stories and songs, projected in > a campfire atmosphere. Autry told his listeners that his broadcasts were > coming directly from his home, Melody Ranch, in the San Fernando Mountains. > He surrounded himself with a cast of regular foot-stompers ... The music was > decidedly Western, with heavy accordion emphasis. There was usually one > \\"Cowboy Classic\\" by Autry. [Pat] Buttram's acts were inserted for comic > relief and consisted mainly of back-and-forth banter with Autry ... The > highlight of each show, at least for the juvenile listeners, came when Autry > told a 10- to 15-minute story, fully dramatized, of some recent adventure. An article in Movie-Radio Guide in 1941 gave a couple of examples of plots used on the show: \\"Sometimes they're initiating an eastern tenderfoot visiting the ranch; sometimes they're saving the school teacher and her children trapped in a ring of fire.\\"Gene Autry and His \\"Melody Ranch\\", Movie-Radio Guide, March 1, 1941, p.33.

Born in Texas, > Autry was raised north of the Red River near Ravia after his parents moved > there in the 1920s. Autry's Flying A Ranch, where the famous cowboy kept his > rodeo stock, was located adjacent to the town that was, at the time, known > as Berwyn.

To mark the occasion, Autry broadcast his > Gene Autry's Melody Ranch radio show from the Flying A, and more than 35,000 > people turned out for the festivities, which included Autry parading through > the town atop a flatbed car. At the time, the population of the newly re- > christened town was around 300 people, according to Mary Schutz, director of > programs and publicity at the Gene Autry Oklahoma Museum there. Three weeks later, on Sunday, December 7, 1941, from the CBS KNX Playhouse, Studio C, in Hollywood, the live broadcast of the Melody Ranch program was delayed for a 15-minute news update regarding the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor which had commenced some six hours earlier in the morning at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time. Probably not yet aware of the attack, everyone in the KNX studio was stunned. Somehow they managed to get through a shortened program after the cue was finally given to begin.Bond, Johnny, 30 Years on the Road With Gene Autry, Riverwood Press and the Beverly and Jim Rogers Museum of Lone Pie Film History, copyright 2007 Sherry Bond, p. 53Attack Finds Network News Setups Ready - Commercials Cancelled, Broadcasting, December 15, 1941, p.9, column 4 On December 21, 1941, a 45-minute Melody Ranch Christmas Special aired from the KNX Playhouse in Hollywood. The 45 minute format continued on into 1942 with a second drama added as the theme of the program quickly changed to support the war effort. The second drama was often about a historic U.S. Cavalry battle with the Indians or a similar historic event. The songs were a mix of Western and patriotic selections. The other notable episode came July 26, 1942, when Autry took his oath of office to join the United States Army Air Forces during that day's broadcast of the Melody Ranch programGene Autry's Melody Ranch Radio Show July 26, 1942, Enlistment of Orvon Gene Autry into the U.S. Army Air Forces, Chicago, IllinoisAndrews, Bill, Sergeant Gene Autry (cover story), Movie-Radio Guide, September 5, 1942, pp. cover,4,33, which originated from the CBS WBBM Playhouse, Studio 10, in Chicago.Family Search, United States World War II Army Enlistment Records, 1938-1946, Orvon G.

While the format remained the same it was the theme that was modified. The name of the show was changed to Sergeant Gene Autry retaining its same CBS timeslot.\\"Autry Series Revamped\\", Broadcasting, August 3, 1942, p. 45 The show began to include Army Air Forces songs and the drama became Army Air Forces oriented as well. At first still originating at or through KNX in Los Angeles and WBBM in Chicago, soon the show began originating from various Army Air Forces bases through local CBS stations, often from one of Luke Field's facilities through CBS affiliate KOY in Phoenix as well as from various air fields in Texas and elsewhere. Personnel changed in the process using those then in the U.S. Army Air Forces. The members of the trio were now Eddie Dean, Jimmie Dean (brother of Eddie), and Dick Reinhart. Carl Cotner was also in the service and was still involved with the program. The program now included much talk about and interviews of Army Air Forces personnel and songs such as \\"Private Buckaroo\\", \\"Army Air Corps Song\\", and \\"I'll Trade My Horse and Saddle for a Pair of Wings\\". There was also still a cowboy song or two included as well as a Western Classic. The program was introduced by Wrigley and at the end of the show handed back to Wrigley at KNX in Hollywood so they could do their gum commercials even though Doublemint gum was no longer available due to the government's rationing of sugar. The announcer would advise the audience that the program was not an endorsement of the Wrigley product by the U.S. Army Air Forces. In early August 1943, Gene Autry was transferred to the Air Transport Command. The last Sergeant Gene Autry Show aired August 1, 1943 from the Luke Field Recreation Hall near Phoenix. The program was replaced with a new Wrigley series, America in the Air, which premiered on August 8, 1943, featuring dramas portraying war-front events,\\"Wrigley War Dramas\\", Broadcasting, August 9, 1943, p. 22 bottom left and ran until the Autry series returned.\\"AUTRY FOR WRIGLEY\\", Broadcasting, July 23, 1945, p. 4, 89 center right With World War II having ended, Gene Autry's Melody Ranch returned to the airwaves on September 23, 1945 as a 15-minute program,\\"WILLIAM WRIGLEY Jr. Co.\\" and \\"Autry for Wrigley\\", Broadcasting, September 17, 1945, pp. 62 center and 70 lower right going to a 30-minute format on July 16, 1946.\\"HOWARD KETTING ...\\", Broadcasting, June 17, 1946, p. 57 lower left The Pinafores, joined the show in September 1945 followed by the Cass County Boys in November 1945. In 1953, the King Sisters, as the Gene Autry Blue Jeans, replaced the Pinafores. Eventually Wrigley cut back on the budget and the orchestra's violin section was replaced by an organ. Alvino Rey came on board about the same time. In late 1955 or early 1956 the Melody Ranch program was reduced to 25 minutes to make room for a five-minute news update. Carl Cotner, the Cass County Boys, Johnny Bond, Pat Buttram, and announcer Charlie Lyon continued to the end. The contract with Wrigley called for a new Melody Ranch episode each week. Occasionally it was necessary to substitute a previously aired transcribed episode and Wrigley made it known that this was unacceptable. When this happened again on May 6, 1956 Wrigley cancelled. A tribute program followed a week later on May 13, 1956 hosted by Pat Buttram and Charles Lyon.Empty Mike, Broadcasting, May 14, 1956, p.7, bottom center Reissues In 1973, American Radio Programs reissued episodes of the program for use by radio stations.

It is one of the best preserved brochs in Scotland. Location Dun Telve () stands on the north bank of the Abhainn a‚ÄôGhlaine Bhig, in the lower reaches of Gleann Beag. It lies next to the minor road which leads south from Glenelg. The neighbouring broch of Dun Troddan lies to the east, and the \\"semi-broch\\" known as Dun Grugaig is around further east. History It is thought that the broch was robbed for stone in 1722 (probably for the building of Bernera Barracks in Glenelg). Dun Telve was popular with tourists by the late 18th century, and was first sketched in the late 18th century. It was surveyed in detail in 1871‚Äì1873 by Henry Dryden. The building was brought into state care between 1882 and 1901 and the boundary markers that define the area of guardianship are still visible. Around 1914 a programme of works was undertaken by the Office of Works which included \\"clearing out\\" the interior, inserting concrete into the upper intramural space and pointing the internal wall-face. The broch has never been archaeologically excavated. The broch is now in the care of Historic Scotland. Description The broch consists of a drystone tower which measures in diameter, and currently stands to a maximum height of to the west and northwest. The external walls are thick at the base and thick at the top. The entrance is on the west but it has been modified, probably in the mid-19th century. On the south side of the entrance passage is a small side-chamber, sometimes called a \\"guard cell\\". A doorway on the north side of the interior of the broch provides access first to an internal cell and then to the intramural space that narrows as it rises through to the top of the surviving wall. Access up the tower is by a winding stone stair, and openings at intervals once gave access to the upper floors. The presence of two horizontal stone ledges, or scarcements, up the height of the surviving section suggests that there were two upper floors. The top floor would have been around above ground level. Structures appended to the west and northwest sides of Dun Telve include at least one rectangular building.

It aired for 3 series from 7 November 1983 until 17 December 1985 normally on a Friday afternoon., retrieved 2014-02-13 Description The show includes sketches and games that are slapstick in nature. The contestants were schoolchildren (except for series 3 - see Criticism). Much of the dialogue was pun-laden and tended to elicit groans from the audience. Scores were decided via a clapometer measuring the volume of the clapping/cheering of the children in the audience. Scores were recorded by The Gemini Twins in series 1 and Leni Harper in series 2 and 3. One of the show's highlights was the spoof adverts for fake products used in pranks, most of them made by fictional company Top Kid. Catchphrases A number of catchphrases were associated with the show including: * \\"So that means that the Creeps are top of being bottom and the Crawlers are bottom of being top!\\" (Gary Wilmot after the current scores have been announced) * \\"Miss Harper - to the scoreboard, please!\\" (Gary Wilmot to Lena Harper - series 2 and 3) * \\"Mark 'em, top kids!\\" (Leni Harper when asking the audience to score the contestants on the clap-o- meter - series 2 and 3) Production The show was co-created by John Langdon and a 17-year-old schoolboy Ian White. The producer Judy Whitfield would later go on to produce The Tweenies. Criticism The programme could be seen as an inferior re-formulation of the long-running Crackerjack TV series. In series 1 and 2 the contestants were school children with their dialogue unscripted. However the final series was more fully scripted with young actors (many from the popular children's drama of the time Grange Hill) only pretending to compete.

Insignia is one of three companies in the United States (the other two are Valassis Communications and News America Marketing) that control almost all the in-store ads and grocery coupons in the United States. The company is broken into two parts, the first of which maintains a relationship with retailers for placing signage in stores. The second part markets and provides signage to Fast-moving consumer goods, better known as consumer packaged goods companies (or simply CPG companies), which are then placed into the partnering retail locations.  History  Insignia Systems, Inc. was founded on January 2, 1990 by G.L. Hoffman and David Eiss. The company began operations by selling Impulse sign machines that printed in- Store signs and labels. In 1991, Insignia Systems became a publicly traded company, trading on the NASDAQ as ISIG, moving to the National Market in 2002. In 1993 Stylus software was introduced as precursor to the future Insignia POPS line and the original Impulse machine was replaced with the SignRight machine in 1996. Soon after, in 1998, the Insignia POPS innovative sign program became the company's featured product. 1998 was a critical year for Insignia as sales were down and new business was a necessity. In May of that same year the Insignia POPS sign was introduced and, on February 24, 1998, Scott Drill was named CEO of the company. With Drill providing additional direction and the POPS business established, the company and the POPS program grew quickly, reaching 1 million signs in 2001 and 40 million signs in 2011.Insignia Systems, Inc. June 25, 1991 Prospectus. Plymouth, MN: Miller, Johnson, & Keuhn, Incorporated, 1991. Through 2006 and 2007, Insignia confirmed a 10-year partnership with Valassis Communications, filling the in- store void for Valassis.Insignia Systems, Inc. and Valassis secure first sale resulting from recently formed strategic alliance\\" Insignia Systems, Inc. Press release, September 6, 2006 In 2011, the Company reached a settlement of a lawsuit between Insignia Systems and News America Marketing, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. The basis of the lawsuit was the accusation of News America Marketing for engaging in various antitrust practices. New America Marketing settled the lawsuit for $125 million, and the two companies entered into a business agreement, making Insignia the sole third party provider of in-store signs with price. In December 2011, Insignia purchased a state-of-the-art Laser Die Cutter (die cutting), making their POP Signs graphically customizable. This new creative capability, along with the exclusive price on sign, revamped Insignia's business. Due to the success and added customization of their signs, Insignia POPS expanded their product lines to include Shape POPS, Equity POPS, Shape POPS Premier, Brand POPS and Banner POPS. POPS now continues to be a major component in Insignia Systems' profit giving them a great deal of traction in the in-store advertising landscape. In 2013, Insignia Systems introduced the Insignia PLUS program. Similar to the Insignia POPS Program, Insignia PLUS offers retailers signage for retail- specific programs such as nutritional programs, aisle navigation signage and signage for private label brands. In 2014, Insignia Systems introduced The Like Machine to their lineup of in-store marketing solutions. The Like Machine allows consumers to express their opinions on a product directly at the shelf by simply pressing a button. This information is then displayed for future customers to use for their purchasing decisions.  Insignia POPS Program  The Insignia POPS Program is the consumer-facing brand of Insignia. Insignia POPS is a sign placed at the shelf, primarily in grocery stores, that contains brand messaging, brand graphics and price. According to the company, the Insignia POPS Program has access to more than 23,000 stores across the United States through their own retailer network and other business relationships. Insignia utilizes a laser die cutter to create each sign individually which allows for unique patterns, shapes and granularity of the signs produced. On January 13, 2014, Insignia announced that the company had produced its 50 millionth Insignia POPS sign with the laser die cutter.  The Like Machine  The Like Machine, developed by TLM Holdings, LLC, is a consumer approval device designed to bring the benefits of online recommendations to brick and mortar stores.

Legal Cases  At the beginning of 2011, in a case in Minnesota brought by Insignia Systems, News America faced more than $600 million in fines. The News Corporation paid out $125 million to settle the allegations of anticompetitive behavior and violations of antitrust laws. This was the third time that the two companies had been involved in lawsuits. In August 2000, Insignia was sued by News America regarding exclusive promotional agreements with several major supermarket retailers, a suit that was settled confidentially in November 2002. In November 2003 Insignia was sued again, regarding Insignia's right to market in-store advertising and promotional services.

It first aired on 12 February 2014 on BBC Two. Written by Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton, it stars the writers as a pair of hapless burglars attempting to break into the large, modernist house of a couple‚Äîplayed by Denis Lawson and Oona Chaplin‚Äîto steal a painting. Once the burglars make it into the house, they encounter obstacle after obstacle, while the lovers, unaware of the burglars' presence, argue. The episode progresses almost entirely without dialogue, relying instead on physical comedy and slapstick, though more sinister elements are present in the plot. In addition to Pemberton, Shearsmith, Lawson and Chaplin, \\"A Quiet Night In\\" also starred Joyce Veheary and Kayvan Novak. Shearsmith and Pemberton had originally considered including a dialogue-free segment in their television series Psychoville, but ultimately did not; they found the format of Inside No. 9 appropriate for revisiting the idea. Both journalists and those involved with the episode's production commented on the casting of Chaplin, a grandchild of the silent film star Charlie Chaplin, in an almost entirely dialogue-free episode, though her casting was not a deliberate homage. Critics generally responded positively to the episode, and a particularly laudatory review by David Chater was published in The Times, prompting a complaint from a reader who found the episode more traumatic than comedic. On its first airing, \\"A Quiet Night In\\" was watched by 940,000 viewers (4.8% of the market). \\"A Quiet Night In\\" was submitted to the British Academy of Film and Television Arts for the 2015 awards, but it was not nominated. Pemberton and Shearsmith have said that they have no plans to do further silent episodes, but have compared \\"A Quiet Night In\\" to the highly-experimental \\"Cold Comfort\\" from Inside No. 9 second series, a sentiment echoed by some television critics. Production Writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, who had previously co-written and starred in The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville, took inspiration for Inside No. 9 from \\"David and Maureen\\", episode 4 of the first series of Psychoville, which was in turn inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. \\"David and Maureen\\" took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots. At the same time, the concept of Inside No. 9 was a \\"reaction\\" to Psychoville, with Shearsmith saying that \\"we'd been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, we thought it would be nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week. That's appealing, because as a viewer you might not like this story, but you've got a different one next week.\\" As an anthology series with horror themes, Inside No. 9 also pays homage to Tales of the Unexpected, The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. The format of Inside No. 9 allowed Pemberton and Shearsmith to explore ideas which are less practical for other approaches to storytelling, such as the possibility of a script with little dialogue. Prior to writing \\"A Quiet Night In\\", Shearsmith had spoken with directors, including Ben Wheatley, about the possibility of producing television without speech. The directors had expressed doubts, Shearsmith explained, because the success of dialogue- free television comes down entirely to the visuals and filming. \\"A Quiet Night In\\" was inspired by an idea Shearsmith and Pemberton had discussed for Psychoville. The writers had considered omitting dialogue from a ten-minute section in an episode, or even from the whole episode. Pemberton explained that this was not possible as there were \\"too many good jokes\\" which they wanted to fit into the sequence. This episode, like \\"A Quiet Night In\\", dealt with a break-in. The mostly dialogue-free episode starred Oona Chaplin (pictured, 2016), a grandchild of the silent film star Charlie Chaplin.Inside No. 9, for Pemberton, offered the \\"perfect vehicle\\" for revisiting the possibility of dialogue-free television. Shearsmith said that, at the start of the writing process, the pair did not have the intention of scripting the entire episode without dialogue, and that it would be \\"great\\" to have ten minutes without it. However, Pemberton said it was easier to write once they had entered the correct \\"mindset\\". Once half an episode had been written, Pemberton said, the pair thought \\"we've just got to keep going\\". The only dialogue in the episode is right at the end; \\"what a great thing to get to the end and just have one line of dialogue\\", Pemberton suggested, comparing the concept to that of the Mel Brooks film Silent Movie. The story of \\"A Quiet Night In\\" revolves around a break-in, which, combined with an argument between the people living in the house, means that the characters all have a reason to be silent. At 18 pages of stage directions, the script contained every joke in the episode, an exercise in planning atypical for Shearsmith and Pemberton. The story contains multiple \\"reveals\\"; Pemberton explained that he and Shearsmith \\"hope there's an 'oh my God' moment. There is always a desire to wrong-foot the viewer. That's what you strive to do\\". Pemberton said that writing for a silent episode \\"makes you inventive in a completely different way\\". The episode was filmed at the White Lodge, in Oxted, Surrey. The episode's burglars are played by the writers; the pair were quoted as saying \\"we didn't want to dominate [the series], so we sometimes play fairly minor characters. But we know that, say, if we were writing something about two burglars, we'd be the burglars.\\" Pemberton suggested that a partial influence for the episode may have been the children's television series Brum. He said that he and Shearsmith had \\"always wanted to be a couple of robbers in that, so that might be where the idea came from\\". Both writers agreed that their roles were \\"great to perform\\", and Pemberton described the resulting episode by saying that it \\"worked out better than [they] could have dreamed\\". As the format of Inside No. 9 requires new characters each week, the writers were able to attract actors who may have been unwilling to commit to an entire series. In addition to Pemberton and Shearsmith, \\"A Quiet Night In\\" starred Denis Lawson, Joyce Veheary, Oona Chaplin and Kayvan Novak. Pemberton commented on the appropriateness of casting Chaplin, a grandchild of the silent film star Charlie Chaplin, in an episode with little dialogue. Shearsmith stressed that the episode should not be considered a silent film in the same way as Charlie Chaplin's, elsewhere saying that the casting was \\"almost an accident but maybe a little nod\\". Bruce Dessau, writing in The Independent, described the casting choice as \\"a satisfying nod to silent cinema\\". Both Oona Chaplin and the Inside No. 9 executive producer Jon Plowman stressed, however, that there was no significance in the casting. Chaplin also said that her character was very unlike herself, explaining that the \\"big boobs, the heels, the blonde wig ... freed [her] up amazingly\\". Plot Inside a large, modernist house, Gerald (Lawson) turns on Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 and sits down to soup brought by his housekeeper, Kim (Veheary). Through the windows behind him, burglars Eddie (Pemberton) and Ray (Shearsmith) are seen. Ray enters the house, then lets in Eddie while Gerald is using the toilet. Eddie is shocked to see that the pair have come to steal an almost completely white painting. Ray starts to dismantle the painting while Eddie keeps watch; he tries to guide a Yorkshire Terrier out of the patio window, but inadvertently lets in an Irish Wolfhound. As Ray releases the wolfhound, Eddie accidentally throws the terrier into the window, so Ray stuffs the dog into an umbrella stand. Sabrina (Chaplin) walks down the stairs, and Ray puts the painting back and hides. Sabrina turns down Gerald's music to watch EastEnders. Gerald returns, sitting away from Sabrina. He turns up his music and the pair fight over the television remote, before leaving through the patio door and arguing, though their voices are muffled. Ray cuts away the canvas and replaces it with kitchen roll. When Sabrina reenters, she unknowingly stands on the canvas. Kim picks it up, mistaking it for laundry, and heads into a laundry room as Sabrina walks upstairs. Eddie follows Kim and she sprays something into his eyes. Ray knocks out Kim and sees the canvas in a laundry basket, which is sent up a laundry chute. He runs upstairs, while Gerald remains outside. Sabrina packs a holdall, including the contents of the laundry basket. She locks the case and heads into an en suite. Downstairs, Gerald retrieves a pistol and heads back outside. Ray attempts to steal the key from Sabrina's discarded trousers and he sees that Sabrina is a trans woman. On the patio, Gerald points the gun into his mouth, as Eddie stumbles around in the lounge area, having accidentally pushed chilli peppers into his eyes. Ray hides under Sabrina's bed as she reenters the room; lying on a sex doll with both breasts and a penis, he is almost discovered. Eddie washes his face, and Gerald starts to play \\"Without You\\". Sabrina makes her way downstairs, taking the holdall's key. Sabrina and Gerald dance. Ray drags the case to the top of the stairs and meets Eddie. Gerald lays Sabrina down on the sofa, places a cushion over her face and shoots her. Gerald turns off the music as the doorbell is heard. Answering the door, Gerald sees a man (Novak) who holds up a sign reading \\"Hello, my name is Paul. I am deaf & dumb.\\" The reverse of the sign reads \\"Do you need any cleaning products today?\\" Gerald heads inside and hides Sabrina's body as Paul waits. Gerald splashes his soup onto the blood and invites Paul to clean it. Ray runs down the stairs and meets Paul; he proceeds to buy rope before returning upstairs. Paul continues to clean, but sees the bullethole in the cushion, and then the suitcase being lowered outside the window. Gerald heads outside to investigate, but Eddie and Ray drop the case on his head. The burglars run past Paul and look out to see the canvas in the pool, before both being shot by Paul. Paul rings someone and says \\"Hello, it's me. Yeah, it's done.\\" He looks to the fake painting, and says \\"I've got it right here. Yeah, it's fine. Not a peep out of anyone.\\" He takes down the painting and walks out, as the real canvas is seen sinking in the pool. Analysis The style of \\"A Quiet Night In\\" is experimental and represents a creative risk. While Pemberton and Shearsmith's characters provide comedy, the relationship of Lawson and Chaplin's characters adds an element of darkness. The two storylines are brought together with the violence towards the end of the episode, resulting in the juxtaposition of elements reminiscent of both the Chuckle Brothers (slapstick) and Quentin Tarantino (bloody violence). Though the comedy remains black, the comedic style of the episode differs considerably from that of \\"Sardines\\", the previous installment of Inside No. 9. \\"A Quiet Night In\\" offers a kind of \\"sadistic slapstick\\" humour; physical comedy, toilet humour and buffoonery are utilised, with the episode effectively becoming a farce. \\"A Quiet Night In\\" builds upon silent comedy tropes and norms, but, for the comedy critic Bruce Dessau, the tone is closer to that of Kill List or Sightseers than to the work of Buster Keaton. The episode features various twists, and these are generally in keeping with Pemberton and Shearsmith's typical approach, though one is reminiscent of the Farrelly brothers. Reception Critics generally responded positively to \\"A Quiet Night In\\". David Chater, writing for The Times, gave a highly laudatory review, saying the episode was \\"the funniest, cleverest, most imaginative and original television I have seen for as long as I can remember ‚Äì one of those fabulous programmes where time stands still and the world around you disappears\\". He chose not to reveal too much about the plot for fear of \\"spoiling the fun\\". Chater later described the episode as \\"mindboggling in its originality\\", and \\"one of the funniest, most imaginative programmes shown on television in the past 15 years\\". Jane Simon, writing for the Daily Mirror, called the episode a \\"triumph\\", while writers for Metro described the episode as \\"quality comedy\\", and journalists writing for The Sunday Times characterised it as a \\"brilliantly conceived and choreographed mime\\". Jack Seale, writing for the Radio Times, also stressed how the episode was \\"beautifully choreographed\\", praising Pemberton and Shearsmith's \\"willingness to attempt difficult concepts\\". Dessau considered the episode \\"genius\\", and described the twist ending as \\"genuinely unexpected\\". In The Observer, Mike Bradley called \\"A Quiet Night In\\" a \\"priceless silent farce\\", but, in the newspaper's sister publication The Guardian, Luke Holland was more critical. He said the episode was \\"an almost wordless half-hour of physical comedy\\", and that \\"it plays out like a French farce, its comedic strokes far broader\\" than those of \\"Sardines\\". \\"If you find two men silently mime-arguing about how long it takes to have a poo funny\\", he continued, \\"you're on sturdy ground here\\". Later, a review by Phelim O'Neill of the Inside No. 9 series 1 boxset published on theguardian.com described \\"A Quiet Night In\\" as \\"engaging, tense, funny, frightening ‚Äì and accessibly experimental\\". The episode was compared negatively to the later instalment \\"Tom & Gerri\\" in an Irish Daily Mail review‚Äî\\"A Quiet Night In\\" was called \\"patchy\\"‚Äîbut was compared positively to \\"Last Gasp\\" by Rebecca McQuillan of The Herald, who said that \\"A Quiet Night In\\" was \\"something close to comedy genius\\". An anonymous review in the South African newspaper The Saturday Star picked out \\"A Quiet Night In\\" as the strongest episode of the first series. After the episode had aired, The Times received an email complaint about Chater's positive review of the episode, which was discussed by the journalist Rose Wild. Part of the complaint read: In response, Wild said: \\"I am sorry if we left any permanent damage. In our defence, we did say 'black' comedy.\\" Wild agreed with the reader's comment that she and her husband \\"must be very different kinds of people\\" from Chater. Viewing figures On its first airing, the episode received 940,000 viewers (4.8% of the market). This was lower than the 1 million (5.6% of viewers) of the series's debut, \\"Sardines\\", and lower than the 1.8 million (7.4%) of Line of Duty which immediately preceded \\"A Quiet Night In\\" in most UK listings. A repeat, shown on 26 May on BBC2, attracted 900,000 viewers, which was 4% of the audience. On this occasion, the episode followed The Fast Show Special. The series average, based upon the viewing figures of the first broadcast of each episode, was 904,000 viewers, or 4.9% of the audience, lower than the slot average of 970,000 (5.1% of the audience). Legacy \\"A Quiet Night In\\" was submitted to the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), but was not nominated for a 2015 BAFTA award. In an interview with Digital Spy, Shearsmith said that this surprised him, saying \\"I was upset, I did think it was a shame that it's not been recognised. You want people to have seen it and to have recognised the work, and innovation, but I think people are doing that. I get told that every day on Twitter, or in meetings.\\" A number of journalists expressed surprise that Inside No. 9 had received no BAFTA nominations, with Julia Raeside, of The Guardian, describing \\"A Quiet Night In\\" as \\"one of the most inspired pieces of mute theatre I've seen on television\\". In 2015, Shearsmith said that he and Pemberton had no intention to write any further silent episodes, as they would not want viewers to think they had run out of ideas, while Pemberton separately said that the pair had no desire to do what would be an inferior version of \\"A Quiet Night In\\". \\"Cold Comfort\\", the fourth episode of the second series of Inside No. 9, was compared to \\"A Quiet Night In\\" by Pemberton, Shearsmith and some critics. \\"Cold Comfort\\" was also filmed an experimental style, with most of the episode shot from fixed cameras and displayed on a split screen. Despite this‚Äîwith its focus on listening and the fact that it was mostly static‚Äî\\"Cold Comfort\\" could, for Pemberton, be seen as the \\"polar opposite\\" of \\"A Quiet Night In\\". In June 2016, there was a screening of \\"A Quiet Night In\\" at Arnolfini as part of Bristol's Slapstick Festival. The one-off event, entitled \\"A Quiet Night In with Reece & Steve\\", also featured Pemberton and Shearsmith discussing the episode on-stage with Robin Ince, followed by a question and answer session with the writers. In an interview with Craig Jones of the Bristol Post, Shearsmith said that he was \\"very excited to come to Bristol\\", and that he and Pemberton had been wanting to be involved with Slapstick Festival for some time. He said that \\"It is a lovely thing to be part of and it is great to see how respected slapstick still remains.\\" NotesReferencesFurther reading * External links  \\"A Quiet Night In\\" at the British Comedy Guide * \\"A Quiet Night In\\" at TVGuide.co.uk * The White Lodge, where the episode was filmed Category:2014 British television episodes Category:British LGBT-related television episodes Category:Burglary in fiction Category:Inside No. 9 episodes Category:Television episodes about murder Category:Transgender- related television episodes Category:Works about couples Category:Television episodes about theft ","title":"A Quiet Night In"},{"id":"41934648","text":"Annouk van der Weijden (born 27 June 1986) is a Dutch speed skater.

Guttenberg plagiarism scandal refers to the German political scandal that led to the resignation of Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg as Minister of Defence of Germany over the plagiarism of his doctoral dissertation. The first accusations of plagiarism in Guttenberg's dissertation were made public in February 2011. Guttenberg's doctoral dissertation, \\"\\" (\\"Constitution and Constitutional Treaty\\"), had been the basis of his 2007 Doctorate from the University of Bayreuth. Guttenberg at first denied intentional plagiarism, calling the accusations \\"absurd,\\" but acknowledged that he may have made errors in his footnotes. In addition, it emerged that Guttenberg had requested a report from the Bundestag's research department, which he had then inserted into his thesis without attribution. On 23 February 2011, Guttenberg apologized in parliament for flaws in his thesis, but denied intentional deception and denied the use of a ghostwriter. On 23 February 2011, the University of Bayreuth withdrew Guttenberg's doctorate. In part due to the expressions of confidence by Angela Merkel, the scandal continued to evoke heavy criticism from prominent academics, legal scholars (who accused Guttenberg of intentional plagiarism), and politicians both in the opposition and in the governing coalition. On 1 March 2011, Guttenberg announced his resignation as Minister of Defense, from his seat in the Bundestag, and from all other political offices. In May 2011, a University of Bayreuth commission tasked with investigating Guttenberg's dissertation came to the conclusion that Guttenberg had engaged in intentional deception in the writing of his dissertation, and had violated standards of good academic practice. The commission found that he had included borrowed passages throughout his thesis, without citation, and had modified those passages in order to conceal their origin. In November 2011, the prosecution in Hof discontinued the criminal proceedings for copyright violations against Guttenberg on condition of Guttenberg paying ‚Ç¨20,000 to a charity. The prosecutor found 23 prosecutable copyright violations in Guttenberg's dissertation, but estimated that the material damage suffered by the authors of those texts was marginal. Background Guttenberg studied law at the University of Bayreuth, where he passed the first legal state examination in 1999. In 2007, he was awarded a doctorate in law, under supervision of Peter H√§berle, with a dissertation on the development of constitutional law in the United States and the European Union. The doctoral thesis was titled \\"\\" (translation: \\"Constitution and Constitutional Treaties ‚Äì Constitutional Steps of Development in the USA and the EU\\"). The university awarded the dissertation with the highest honor ‚Äúsumma cum laude‚Äù. Loss of doctorate and resignation=Fischer-Lescano plagiarism review On 12 February 2011 Andreas Fischer-Lescano, professor of law at the University of Bremen, prepared a review of Guttenberg's thesis for the left-leaning German legal quarterly ‚ÄúKritische Justiz‚Äù. Fischer-Lescano was co-editor of this publication. During a reference check he discovered an article of the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung (NZZ), published in 2003, of which passages had been included in Guttenberg's thesis without citation. After this discovery Fischer-Lescano performed further searches and discovered seven more passages lacking proper citation. He discussed the findings with the other editors of ‚ÄúKritische Justiz‚Äù and they decided that their publication, with only 1,800 subscribers, was not the appropriate forum to make the findings public. So Fisher-Lescano contacted the German newspaper S√ºddeutsche Zeitung in Munich. On February 15, 2011 the newspaper contacted law professor Diethelm Klippel, the Bayreuth University ombudsman, and informed him of the plagiarism charges. Klippel had also been on the review committee for Guttenberg's doctoral thesis. On the same day the newspaper informed Guttenberg and gave him a few hours to respond to the allegations. Guttenberg was on an official visit in Poland that day. Fischer-Lescano informed Guttenberg's thesis supervisors Peter H√§berle and Rudolf Streinz about the charges. Guttenberg offers resignation On 16 February 2011 the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung published an article reporting the allegations against Guttenberg. On the same day the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) reported that the introduction of his thesis was borrowed from an FAZ-article from 1997, written by the political scientist Barbara Zehnpfennig. In a first statement Guttenberg, who still was in Poland, called the charge, his thesis being a plagiarism, ‚Äúabstruse‚Äù. He insisted that the thesis was his own achievement and that none of his employees helped him to draft it. The University of Bayreuth delegated the allegations against Guttenberg to its Commission on Professional Self Regulation in Science. On 16 February 2011, after his return from Poland, Guttenberg left for a surprise visit to German soldiers in Afghanistan. He spent the night in the military camp ‚ÄúOP North‚Äù in the war zone Baghlan province. Although the visit had been planned weeks in advance, allegations were raised, that this trip was some kind of ‚Äúgetaway‚Äù for Guttenberg. Guttenberg returned the next day, 17 February 2011, and had a meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel. His offer to resign was refused by Merkel. The same day the University of Bayreuth sent a letter to Guttenberg conceding him two weeks to respond to the plagiarism allegations. The crowd- source Guttenplag Wiki was launched by anonymous user PlagDoc as a platform for internet user to submit claims of unattributed work in Guttenberg's thesis. A scheduled speech at an election campaign in Saxony-Anhalt was cancelled by Guttenberg because of his meeting with Angela Merkel. The district attorney's office in Hof, Bavaria, announced it would wait on the results of the Bayreuth University's examination of Guttenberg's thesis and confirmed that two criminal complaints had been filed against Guttenberg, one regarding possible copyright violations and another on a possible false statutory declaration. The second was immediately declined by the attorney due to apparent insubstantiality. The same day the newspaper S√ºddeutsche Zeitung reported its findings that Guttenberg had used texts of 19 authors without correct attribution. Chancellor Angela Merkel declared: ‚ÄúHe has my full confidence for his work, and this work is important. He has my support [‚Ä¶] and we must wait until the university has completed its examination of the allegations‚Äù. In an interview the chancellor attested Guttenberg had a ‚Äúhead- on approach‚Äù on the allegations. Use of Parliamentary Research Service On February 19, 2011, the German news magazine Der Spiegel reported that Guttenberg had used works of the German Parliamentary Research Service (PRS) without proper attribution. Any publication of PRS papers requires prior approval by the German Bundestag's departmental management. During the weekend of February 20, 2011, Guttenberg re-read his thesis to examine Guttenplag's and other's findings. Guttenplag claims of thesis‚Äô pages containing one (black) or more (red) plagiarism fragments The next day in a letter Guttenberg asked the University of Bayreuth to revoke his title and declared that he had ‚Äúlost track of the use of sources over the course of the seven years in which [he] worked on the thesis‚Äù, but ‚Äúat no point made mistakes by intention‚Äù. Also on 21 February 2011, chancellor Merkel reiterated her support for Guttenberg and told journalists ‚ÄúI appointed Guttenberg as Minister of Defence. I did not appoint him as an academic assistant or doctor. What is important to me is his work as Minister of Defence and he carries out these duties perfectly.‚Äù This statement caused anger in the German academic community. Annette Schavan, German minister of Education and Research, who two years later had to resign herself because of plagiarism-accusations related to her own thesis, declared, that she didn‚Äôt ‚Äúconsider the incident to be a trifle‚Äù, because ‚Äúintellectual theft is not a small thing. The protection of intellectual property is a higher good.‚Äù The same day it became known, that Guttenberg had used another PRS paper without proper citation. That evening Guttenberg attended a campaign event in Kelkheim and stated that he would give up his doctorate title permanently. ‚ÄúOver the weekend I had another look at my doctorate thesis‚Äù, Guttenberg declared and continued \\"I lost sight of the sources in one of two places. I wrote this piece of work myself and I stand by it, but I also stand by the rubbish I wrote\\". Guttenberg admitted ‚Äúserious mistakes‚Äù, which had not been intentionally but ‚Äúdo not meet the ethical code of science‚Äù, and apologized to people, who had been hurt by his work. Guttenberg called his decision to give up the title ‚Äúpainful‚Äù. He rejected all speculation about his resignation and declared: ‚ÄúI will perform my duties with all my powers‚Äù. The University of Bayreuth confirmed the same day that Guttenberg had asked them to revoke his title. Chancellor Merkel approved his decision to give up his title, a spokesman declared. Distinct criticism on Guttenberg's crisis management was passed by Norbert Lammert, President of the German Bundestag. In an interview on 22 February 2013, Lammert also expressed his doubts about the reliability of the university's awarding process. Loss of doctorateParliamentary questioning= The 23 February 2011 Lammert presided over a parliamentary questioning in the Bundestag on Guttenberg's use of PRS papers in his thesis. During the questioning politicians from the opposition called for Guttenberg's resignation‚Äù and accused him of cheating, lying and intentions to deceive. In his reply Guttenberg again apologized and admitted: ‚ÄúI wrote a dissertation that was obviously flawed‚Äù. He described himself as ‚Äúa man of mistakes and weaknesses‚Äù and stated ‚ÄúI did not deliberately cheat, but made serious errors‚Äù. Guttenberg declared: ‚ÄúI was certainly so arrogant as to believe that I could square the circle by trying to coordinate political passion and work, as well as academic and intellectual challenges, with being a young father‚Äù and apologized ‚Äúfor me this was overload, and today I regret to say that I couldn‚Äôt manage it.‚Äù Asked whether his call for the allegations as ‚Äúabstruse‚Äù hadn‚Äôt been premature, Guttenberg confirmed this part of his previous statement as it was related to the accusation of his thesis as being a plagiarism. According to accusations of misusing the German Parliamentary Research Service (PRS) Guttenberg pointed out, that all studies had been related to his political work. He noted that all papers had been cited, but without the authors‚Äô names, as they had been employers of the PRS. Guttenberg stated, that he couldn‚Äôt answer whether he had sought prior approval to use these reports for his thesis but that he had already apologized to Bundestag's President Lammert in case of a potential oversight. =University revoked title= On the same day the doctoral commission of Bayreuth University revoked Guttenberg's PhD. University's president R√ºdiger Bormann declared, that Guttenberg had ‚Äúobjectively not conformed‚Äù to academic standards. According to Bormann this fast revocation was possible because of Guttenberg's statement. The doctoral commission made no judgment as to whether Guttenberg had acted intentionally, something that led to criticism. Such an investigation would ‚Äúsurely have been an extended process‚Äù, Bormann declared, which was unnecessary after Guttenberg's request for a withdrawal of his title. Further inquiries would be done by the Commission of Professional Self Conduct in Science, Bormann announced. Chancellor Merkel commented on the revocation of Guttenberg's title as being ‚Äúin line of what he had requested‚Äù. =Further investigations= On 24 February 2011, Bundestagspr√§sident Norbert Lammert declared that Guttenberg had used six reports by the parliament's research service for his doctoral thesis without prior approval. However, Lammert acknowledged the fact that it was widespread practice among Bundestag Members to use documents prepared by the parliamentary research service without first obtaining the necessary approval. The same day, an open letter to chancellor Merkel was published to be signed by doctoral students and researchers. The successor of Guttenberg's thesis supervisor H√§berle at the University of Bayreuth, Oliver Lepsius, alleged that the minister made the mistakes deliberately and accused him of fraud. Media reported that between 1999 and 2006 a new chair of the University of Bayreuth had been sponsored with ‚Ç¨747.000 by Rh√∂n-Klinikum. Until 2002 Guttenberg's family held a major stake in the hospital and he had been a member of its supervisory board. In a statement the university denied any sponsoring by Guttenberg as the funding had been part of cooperation between the university, a health insurance, the state of Bavaria and Rh√∂n-Klinikum. Two days later, minister Schavan in an interview criticized Guttenberg for his thesis: ‚ÄúAs someone who earned my doctorate 31 years ago and has worked with many doctoral candidates during my career, I‚Äôm embarrassed, and not just privately.‚Äù Bundestag's president Lammert called the affair a ‚Äúnail in the coffin for trust in our democracy‚Äù. Chancellor Merkel announced through her spokesman Steffen Seibert on 28 February 2011 that Guttenberg had still her full confidence. Asked for Merkel's opinion on the fraud accusation by Oliver Lepsius, Seibert declared, that ‚Äúfraud requires intention. Any intention was denied by Guttenberg. The Chancellor believes him.‚Äù Guttenberg himself gained strong support at a CSU- meeting in Munich, while several CSU-politicians sharply criticized Lammert and Schavan on their comments. Resignation as Defense Minister On 1 March 2011 Guttenberg declared his resignation from all political offices at national level. He called this decision the ‚Äúmost painful step of my life‚Äù and declared \\"I was always ready to fight, but I have reached the limits of my strength\\". \\"I must agree with my enemies who say that I was not appointed minister for self-defence, but defence-minister\\" Guttenberg said in view of his ministerial office. As for the enquiry regarding his thesis he announced his full cooperation with the district attorney's investigations. Guttenberg thanked Angela Merkel for her support, trust and understanding. Chancellor Merkel reacted to Guttenberg's decision by saying that ‚ÄúI deeply regret his resignation‚Äù. For Merkel he had ‚Äúa unique and extraordinary ability‚Äù relating to people. For the future the Chancellor declared that \\"I am convinced that we will have the opportunity to work together again in the future, in whatever form that may take\\". R√ºdiger Bormann, president of University of Bayreuth, declared, that the inquiries of its Commission on Professional Self Regulation in Science would continue. Apology On 2 March 2011 the district attorney's office in Hof announced the launch of an investigation into potential copyright violations contained in Guttenberg's thesis as soon as his immunity would be withdrawn. With his official resignation as Member of Parliament the following day, Guttenberg abandoned his parliamentary immunity, thus allowing the district attorney's investigations to proceed. Media reported on more than 80 charges, which had been filed. On 3 March 2011 Guttenberg received his dismissal certificate in a ceremony hosted by German President Christian Wulff. The same day, media reported about an anonymous member of the Commission of Professional Self Regulation in Science allegedly accusing Guttenberg of deception. In contrast, Volker Rieble, law professor at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, himself a strong critic of Guttenberg's thesis, published an op-ed disputing the legal basis for further investigations in view of the fact that the university had already revoked Guttenberg's title and that he was no longer affiliated with the university. On March 5, 2011, the thesis supervisors Peter H√§berle and Rudolf Streinz issued a statement declaring that in 2006, when the thesis was finished, the plagiarism wasn‚Äôt detectable for lack of technical opportunities. Without knowledge of the copied passages, Guttenberg's thesis demonstrated ‚Äúa high degree of analytical depths and penetrated the dissertation topic in all its facets‚Äù, H√§berle emphasized. ‚ÄúIt is important to note that the candidate [Guttenberg] was able to respond successfully to even intense questioning regarding the methodology and content of the thesis and was completely able to hold his own during the discussion as part of the oral PhD exam‚Äù, the supervisors declared on Guttenberg's doctoral examination procedure and its grading (summa cum laude). On 7 March 2011 the district attorney's office in Hof announced the launch of a preliminary investigation into potential copyright violations by Guttenberg. The University of Bayreuth, on 8 March 2011, announced the expansion of the commission investigating Guttenberg's dissertation to also include Wolfgang L√∂wer, professor of law at University of Bonn, and J√ºrgen Mittelstra√ü, professor of philosophy at University of Konstanz. A few days later, as a means of taking responsibility for his error, Guttenberg sent personal apology letters to all those authors who were not properly quoted in his thesis. Guttenberg resigned from his last political office, the Kulmbach county council, on 15 March 2011. At the same day the open letter, signed by 63,713 people, was delivered to the Chancellery in Berlin. On 20 March 2011 the Zurich weekly NZZ published extracts of an apology Guttenberg had sent to Klara Oberm√ºller for not quoting her in his dissertation. Commission report and response On 7 April 2011, the Commission of Professional Self Regulation in Science sent its report of preliminary findings to Guttenberg asking for his response by 26 April 2011. On 9 April 2011, there was a first leak of the commission's initial findings to the press, in which Guttenberg was accused of deliberate deception Guttenberg's lawyer sharply criticized the commission's leaks as an unfair \\"prejudgment\\" of his client given that the press reports were published both before the end of the investigation and before the 26 April deadline Guttenberg had been given by the university to respond to the commission's report before its public release. His lawyer also pointed out that the leaks were a violation of Guttenberg's personal rights. Critics accused Guttenberg of trying to prevent the public release of the commission's final report, an allegation that he rejected. Several representatives from universities and science demanded the release of the commission's report due to public interest. A spokesman of the university rejected the lawyer's charges and stated that there had been no official report accusing Guttenberg of deliberate deception. The spokesman of chancellor Merkel declared on 11 April 2011 that she was expecting full clarification of the matter. Guttenberg's lawyers declared on 13 April 2011 that he was still standing by his commitment of full cooperation but that he was opposed to leaks to the press, which violated proper proceedings and caused prejudgment. Guttenberg had no objection against publishing the commission's report after end of proceedings, the lawyers said. The same day it was reported that the Bundestag would not press charges against Guttenberg. A few days later media published extracts from Guttenberg's initial response to the commission. Guttenberg denied any deliberate plagiarism. He described the working-method during the several years of his dissertation as often working in short periods and using various different data carriers. This led to his losing track of the PhD dissertation, Guttenberg stated. Guttenberg sent his response to the commission's draft report on 26 April 2011. In the following days media again published extracts of his response. On 10 May 2011 media reported that one author, whose work was copied, filed a complaint against Guttenberg with the district attorney's office in Hof. Report of Commission of Professional Self Regulation in Science University of Bayreuth After an announcement on 6 May 2011, already citing the conclusions, the university released the report to the public on 11 May 2011. According to that document, he had \\"grossly violated standard research practices and in so doing deliberately deceived\\" and it further stated that it was \\"obvious that plagiarism was involved\\". Preliminaries The report started with the elaboration of the commission's historical background, its internal duties within the Bayreuth University, also in relation to other committees like the university's promotion commission. These included institutional enhancements, the evaluation of academic misconduct corresponding to standards of scientific community. The report then defined the criteria of academic misconduct: deliberately or grossly negligent use of ‚ÄúFalschangaben‚Äù (misrepresentations), the violation of other's intellectual property, and the obstruction of research. ‚ÄúFalschangaben‚Äù were defined as the fabrication or distortion of data and the ‚Äúobstruction of research‚Äù was defined as unauthorized use of material with arrogation of its authorship. The commission comprised as regular members Wiebke Putz-Osterloh, Nuri Aksel, Paul R√∂sch, Stephan Rixen as chairman, and Diethelm Klippel as a consulting member ‚Äì all from the University of Bayreuth. On 8 March 2011 Wolfgang L√∂wer, professor of law at University of Bonn, and J√ºrgen Mittelstra√ü, professor of philosophy at University of Konstanz joined the commission as consulting members. The report listed four commission's meeting on Guttenberg's thesis: 16 February 2011, 8 and 23 March 2011, and the final meeting on 7 April 2011. The hearings of the thesis‚Äô supervisors were on 23 March 2011. Then the report specified the used material including its communications with Guttenberg himself. Commission‚Äôs findings The commission reported missing citations and violations of the academic rules of citations. It reported numerous verbatim forms of plagiarism and plagiarism with regard to content where the use of other authors‚Äô material was not clearly expressed. The commission exemplified this in detail on the basis of six Parliamentary Research Service (PRS) papers and listed the passages Guttenberg had used in his thesis, including all text modifications and extensions. Two of the PRS papers lacked any citation and four PRS papers were cited insufficiently, leading to misconceptions about the initial authorship of the passages. The commission judged this as deception and described a pattern of creation (werkpr√§gendes Bearbeitungsmuster). As for Guttenberg, the commission concluded on intentional actions and deliberate deception due to the numbers of violations of academic rules of citations. Both the use of verbatim text elements and the use with marginal text changes lacking proper citation or listing cited sources only in bibliography were evaluated as attempts to cover up. The commission saw no indications that the thesis had been written by a ghost- writer. Contrary to previous expectations, the commission denied any responsibility of the thesis supervisors due to a lack of semantic or other indicators for plagiarism and Guttenberg's ‚Äúexceedingly convincing‚Äù oral PhD exam (\\"rigorosum\\"). Only the supervisors‚Äô omission to ask for the PRS papers cited in the bibliography and the grading with ‚Äúsumma cum laude‚Äù was criticized by the commission. Guttenberg‚Äôs statement In his final response, Guttenberg once again denied that he had deliberately deceived the university and instead blamed severe ‚Äúerrors in workmanship‚Äù for the grave deficiencies in his doctoral thesis. He described a high burden of professional commitments as a result of new political responsibilities during the years of his dissertation, which led to an ad-hoc and sometimes chaotic working-method with long intervals between working periods. Guttenberg reported on diverse collections of material such as books, loose sheets of papers, more than 80 data carriers, and several laptops spread across several domiciles, used for his thesis. This led to an overburdening by the thesis, which further increased during the years, Guttenberg described. Family expectations, namely that a started task had to be finished, his intention to not disappoint his supervisor, and his unwillingness to admit weakness, hindered him to quit the dissertation, Guttenberg explained. The commission however, based on the view, that Guttenberg had continued his dissertation despite the feeling of being overburdened, denied negligence and concluded on intention. Reactions=Critic of Walter Schmitt-Glaeser The University of Bayreuth's handling of the matter was sharply criticized by its former Vice-President and law professor Walter Schmitt-Glaeser, who, while agreeing that revoking the doctoral degree was justified, described the additional measures taken by the institution as an attempt at character assassination (\\"Treibjagd\\"). As any affiliation of Guttenberg to the university was severed by the withdrawal of his title, the university therefore lacked legal standing for any further investigation, Schmitt-Glaeser argued. The leaking of information from the commission's confidential meetings to the press ‚Äì according to Schmitt-Glaeser most-likely done by its members ‚Äì he called ‚Äúoutrageous‚Äù and ‚Äúmore than embarrassing‚Äù. For Schmitt-Glaeser especially the part of the report looking into a possible deception by Guttenberg should not have been published. Also, according to Schmitt-Glaeser, the fact that Guttenberg had to agree to the report's publication due to massive public pressure, including from University of Bayreuth, cast a shadow of suspicion on the entire proceedings. The professor, former president (CSU) of the Bavarian senate, also criticized the lack of conclusive evidence to prove the university's assertion that there was \\"deliberate deception\\" on the part of Guttenberg, Schmitt-Glaeser referred to the multiple instances of minor text changes ‚Äì which the commission viewed as indicators of cheating ‚Äì as a typical procedure with a text considered by an author as his own work. With the proceedings the university denied any solicitousness for its former student Guttenberg and damaged his social existence, the professor criticized. From the judicial proceeding on this case he expected a result solely based on facts without regard to the person concerned. In an interview, Schmitt-Glaeser described the university's intention as an attempt to ‚Äúdrag Guttenberg in front of a tribunal and find him guilty‚Äù. In the professor's conviction, knowing Guttenberg personally, he had not committed intentional cheating. Disputed neutrality Others criticized the commission's final report for not decrying the university's own lack of due diligence in the matter and noted that the university had first awarded Guttenberg's degree with the highest possible distinction (\\"summa cum laude\\"). Furthermore, the commission's neutrality was disputed as the University of Bayreuth was party to the proceedings. Among these critics was Thomas Goppel (CSU), former Bavarian Minister of Education, who viewed the report as an attempt by the university to downplay its own responsibility and acquit itself. Others complained about the University's lack of control provisions. Volker Rieble Professor Volker Rieble approved the report of the University but saw the case as an expression of the public desire for ‚Äúritual punishment‚Äù. Rieble decried the widespread practice of academic publications being written by assistants but published by professors as much worse for academia than any plagiarism. G√ºnther Beckstein G√ºnther Beckstein, former Minister- President of Bavaria, referred to Guttenberg by saying that everyone deserves a second chance, after some period of time. August 2011 In August 2011, the authors of Guttenplag Wiki, which triggered similar initiatives on VroniPlag Wiki, were accused of running a partisan campaign after it emerged that the founder of VroniPlag was a member of the opposition SPD party. Cessation of proceedings In November 2011 the attorney's office in Hof dropped the charges against Guttenberg after having found 23 relevant copyright violations with only minor economic damage. This decision was criticized for being biased toward economic criteria. The court approved this arrangement after Guttenberg had agreed to make a donation of 20,000 Euro to a German charitable foundation. The attorney's office saw no indications that Guttenberg had intentionally used other authors‚Äô texts within his thesis without proper attribution and judged his explanation of losing track of sources as ‚Äúcomprehensible and irrefutable‚Äù. Contrary to University of Bayreuth, which had accused Guttenberg of deliberate deception, the prosecution concluded that Guttenberg had made the thesis‚Äô errors only with contingent intent (dolus eventualis). The attorney's office also stated that there was no criminal abuse of his PhD title nor fraud or breach of trust related to PRS papers either.

During the 1970s and 1980s, this underground network contained nightclubs, restaurants, commercial shops, and an arcade. Live music and entertainment consistently made appearances there. The underground music venues included The Frog and Nightgown, The Pier, The Bear's Den, Elliot's Nest and Cafe Deja Vu. The Village Subway, opened in 1972, was shut down in 1984 due to concerns about the fire code, drug use and customer safety. History In 1947, the 158 acres of land that make up Cameron Village were purchased by J. W. York and R. A. Bryan. Their company, York Properties, owned the land until 1964, when the property was sold to Brookmont Corporation in the Dutch Antilles. York Properties still managed the area after they sold it. The 20,000 square feet space was originally constructed as a bomb shelter during the Cold War. It was planned to be used not only as a place for citizens to go during an attack, but also for the federal government to recuperate. Many Cameron Village shoppers are unaware that the Village Subway even existed, but before its closing in 1984, it was full of life and entertainment, hosting many artists that are still popular today as well as many smaller acts. The Village Subway was modeled after Underground Atlanta, a similar entertainment and shopping complex, which is still in use today. Both locations have a similar mix of restaurants, clubs, and boutiques. The name \\"Village Subway\\" came from its New York City-like subway entrance with a long stairwell that led to paintings of trains. There was also rectangular paintings of shops that decorated the walls. Author David Sedaris, who spent his high school years in Raleigh, said he remembers going to the Frog and Nightgown and thinking \\"This is what New York is like!\\" Although The Village Subway had early popularity, there wasn't enough traffic during the day to keep up with the nightlife. Security became a problem, since drugs were beginning to be distributed in the parking lot and service areas surrounding the Village. These issues as well as concerns about the fire code led to the closing of The Village Subway in 1984. Music Scene As interest was recently rekindled in The Village Subway, many former artists that performed at one of the three nightclubs beneath Cameron Village shared their experiences. Dave Adams, a musician who used to play in many of the underground venues, describes how often artists became famous after their performances at The Village Subway more than thirty years ago. Adams played keyboard and sang for many bands during the 1970s. Among them are local bands Glass Moon and The Fabulous Knobs, who both had regional popularity at the time. The atmosphere of The Village Subway, as described by Adams, was \\"diverse and expansive,\\" with \\"all types of music there, from jazz to international groups.\\" Many artists, both well-known and obscure, performed in the underground venue. Some artists are famous for their performances at Raleigh's The Frog and Nightgown, including Paul Jeffrey, known for working with Thelonious Monk. He spent 10 days in North Carolina performing at the Village Subway in 1970. At a later concert of his, excerpts from his set in the Raleigh club were played. The Frog and Nightgown served as Raleigh's only jazz club at the time. Jazz music was popular in Raleigh, and audiences had to keep an eye on who was performing frequently because performers were not often announced in advance. finding her niche in jazz music, artist Lenore Raphael connected with Peter Ingram, owner of the Frog and Nightclub from 1968 until 1975. Both jazz players, they performed together. Some artists though, like Dave Adams, performed frequently at events such as \\"Rock Night,\\" which took place every week. Many other up and coming bands played in the basement venues, from R.E.M. to Jimmy Buffett. The first known concert footage of R.E.M. was recorded in 1982 at The Pier. In addition, Sonic Youth recorded the live track \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\", a Stooges cover, at The Pier for its album Confusion is Sex. The Connells also found their start here, performing at Cafe Deja Vu and other underground clubs in The Village Subway during their early years. They lived in close proximity to Cameron Village, and were able to walk to some of the shows, carrying their equipment with them. Cameron Village Regional Library today. The Village Subway was located directly underneath.  Petition and plans  The interest in The Village Subway was rekindled after a Candid Slice article, written by Heather Leah, reminded people of the vacated area. Upon being shown blueprints of the area by a friend, Leah expressed her interest via her online article. More than five hundred thousand people read the article since July 2013, and the nostalgia associated with the underground club scene caused a petition for a revival of The Village Subway. The groups were asking to bring back the popular nightlife location instead of allowing the space to go unused. The current president of York Properties is G. Smedes York. Fresh Market signed a lease March 28, 2014 to use the old The Village Subway space for food preparation. John Pharr, the senior vice president of Regency's Southwest Region said, \\"This was an unusual situation because The Fresh Market has been at the shopping center a long time, but it's one of their smallest stores. Right now, they are fenced in by the library next door, so it was go vertical or go below. They decided to go below.\\" The Fresh Market Underground will not be open to the public. Fresh Market has one of the two remaining entrances to the underground, the other being behind the Party Shop.  Farewell events  On April 25, 2014, music returned briefly above The Village Subway in an event called \\"Cameron Village Live.\\" The Love Language were performers. This vacant space then reopened one time for a special event on May 16, 2015, to benefit local charities; as reported by the Raleigh News & Observer. The event included a fashion show, live music and a chance to view historic photographs. After this event, an undefined renovation is planned. The underground space is a wide open shell at present, because the structures that enclosed the various clubs and stores have been removed in the past. The article remarks that the prices for admission are not equivalent to those in the 1980s. To gain admission to the event beneath Cameron Village, VIP passes would be $125 and general admission would be $85. The admission tickets sold out within four hours, Indy Week reported; $25,000 was to benefit the Inter- Faith Food Shuttle. There was some criticism in an article by Indy Week after the event, that none of the bands who created the original scene were invited to play again. A wedding band, Crush, was the only live music. As well, Rod Abernethy, a past member of Arrogance, who played at least 75 times in the Underground, said he knew \\"few people\\" from past bands who would be attending because they \\"couldn't afford it\\". When asked if he would be attending, he remarked: \\"No, I didn't buy a ticket. They cost too much for me.\\" See also *Music of North Carolina *Red Hat Amphitheater *Urban exploration *Hopscotch Music Festival *Duke Energy Center for the Performing Arts References External links  *The Underground Comes Alive One Night Only: May 2015 Category:Buildings and structures in Raleigh, North Carolina Category:Entertainment districts in the United States Category:Underground cities Category:Defunct tourist attractions in the United States Category:Music scenes Category:Shopping malls in Raleigh, North Carolina ","title":"The Village Subway"},{"id":"41934714","text":"Jahanabad-e Olya (, also Romanized as JahƒÅnƒÅbƒÅd-e ‚ÄòOlyƒÅ; also known as JahƒÅnƒÅbƒÅd-e BƒÅlƒÅ) is a village in Jahanabad Rural District, in the Central District of Hirmand County, Sistan and Baluchestan Province, Iran.

She was co-founder, with Rosie Boycott, of the feminist Spare Rib magazine in 1972. Early life Born in Sydney, Australia, and raised on the North Shore of Neutral Bay, Rowe's father was an engineer. After a typing course at a Sydney technical college, she worked for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), then based in the grounds of Sydney University. Rowe was a secretary for Oz magazine from 1964 when it was based in Sydney, its original location. Because Rowe was under 21, editors Richard Neville and Richard Walsh had to persuade Rowe's father to allow her join the staff. \\"I saw the freedom, the opportunity to make satire, the (editors') lack of reverence for authority,\\" she told Helen Trinca of The Australian in 2013. \\"I was still rather mentally restricted in terms of authority, but I could see how they were so funny and mentally stimulating. I learnt a lot from OZ -- how to start a magazine and do it yourself. Where do you go for new ideas and thinking?\\" Her period at the Sydney OZ lasted until 1966. Rowe then worked for the Australian edition of Vogue, but found fashion journalism a restrictive area in which to work. Counterculture in London Rowe settled in London in 1969, but at first disliked the city because of the pervading attitude to expatriate Australians. During her six-months in Greece which soon followed, the regime of the Colonels politicised her, and she returned to London. Now employed on the London edition of OZ, one of the magazine's London editors, Felix Dennis later described Rowe as the publication's \\"anchor\\" in this period. When the three editors (Neville, Dennis and Jim Anderson) were tried at the Old Bailey for obscenity in Schoolkids Oz, Rowe was part of the defence team and responsible for typing documents for the defence each evening. \\"I hated having to be a secretary. But I really did have a sort of idea that maybe women were there to support men\\", she told Andy Beckett in 2005. \\"In the counter-culture we still did all that stuff the men didn't\\". However, when the three male editors were away, Rowe was not left in charge. When Neville co-founded the short-lived Ink in 1971, Rowe joined him, but resigned over the male domination of the venture after a few months. Three female typists, she had hired, were sacked by the men when the publication acquired new office equipment. She was aware of what some of the women had passed on to work for Ink; it had no trade union representation.Stephen Alomes (p. 183) writes it was two of the three female typesetters who were removed. It appeared to her, and underground press colleague Louise Ferrier (who was romantically connected to Neville at the time), that sexual freedom for men still meant women were objectified and excluded from the editorial process. With Michelene Wandor also involved, they organised a series of meetings for other women involved in the underground press. Fifty people turned up at the first meeting in December 1971 at Rowe and Ferrier's basement flat in Notting Hill. At the third meeting, Rowe has said she suggested women should establish their own magazine.Beckett, p. 224 An American in London, Bonnie Boston, had suggested the idea to her, but according to Stephen Alomes, the only other supportive voice came from Rosie Boycott.Alomes, p.184. Founding Spare Rib Boycott and Rowe founded Spare Rib, the feminist monthly magazine, the first edition appearing in June 1972. Intended as \\"the alternative news magazine for women\\", Rowe has written that while it was \\"seen as the public face of the women's movement\\", the magazine \\"was not synonymous with the movement\\". The 20,000 print run of the first two issues sold out, helped by the publicity received from the refusal of W. H. Smith to stock it. Boycott and Rowe, however, had significant differences and the formation of a collective to run the magazine, at Rowe's suggestion, led to Boycott being marginalised, and she resigned not much more than a year later after the launch. A Spare Rib Books imprint (soon to be renamed Virago Press) was founded in 1973 by Carmen Callil whose own company had assisted on publicity for the magazine's launch. Rowe and Boycott became directors of the new company, but both resigned the following year. Later life Rowe, after herself leaving Spare Rib, became a freelance editor commissioning books for feminist publishers and writing her own works. Rowe collaborated on The Characters of Fitzrovia with Felix Dennis and Mike Pentelow which was published in November 2001.

Grant's presidency and through the presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes. He also served as a member of the Wisconsin State Senate in 1865 and 1866. Biography Bentley was born in Kingsbury, New York, to Cornelius and Mary Brayton Bentley. As a boy, he worked on his father's farm and attended public schools in the vicinity. He studied law under Judge Enoch H. Rosekrans, of the New York Supreme Court, and Orange Ferriss, who would later serve in Congress. He graduated from Albany Law School in 1857 and was admitted to the New York State Bar Association. He established a legal practice in Glens Falls, New York, where he remained until 1859. In March of 1859, he traveled to the state of Wisconsin, first establishing himself at Manitowoc, then moving to Sheboygan. In 1864, he was elected to represent Sheboygan County in the Wisconsin State Senate on the National Union ticket. He left the senate after a single two-year term and became President of the Sheboygan and Fond du Lac Railroad. In 1876, he was appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant to be United States Commissioner of Pensions after the brief term and resignation of fellow Wisconsinite Charles R. Gill. Bentley went on to serve through the remainder of Grant's term and through the four years of the presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes, relinquishing his office when a successor was appointed by President James A. Garfield. After leaving office, he moved to Denver, Colorado, and restarted his legal practice. Family and personal life On September 5, 1861, Bentley married Isabella J. Peat (1837‚Äì1917).Isabella J Peat Bentley at findagrave.com They had one son, William R. Bentley (1867‚Äì1941).

She discovered important physical evidence for the concept of independent assortment, vital to modern understanding of genetics.  Early life and education  Carothers was born on December 4, 1882 in Newton, Kansas. She studied at the Nickerson Normal College and went on to earn her Bachelor of Arts degree and her Master's degree from the University of Kansas, in 1911 and 1912 respectively.  Research career  She began her career as a Pepper Fellow at Pennsylvania State University, where she stayed from 1913‚Äì1914. That year, she was appointed an assistant professor of zoology there, and graduated with her Ph.D. in 1916. Carothers stayed on as assistant professor until 1936, though she also had an overlapping appointment as an independent investigator for the Marine Biological Laboratory, which lasted from 1920 until 1941. In 1936 she moved to the University of Iowa and was a research associate there until 1941. Her work there was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. While studying and teaching at the University of Pennsylvania, Carothers traveled to the southern and southwestern regions of the United States on research expeditions, held in 1915 and 1919. During her time at the University of Iowa, she completed her most important work, in the field of genetics and cytology, using grasshopper embryos to study the independent assortment of heteromorphic homologous chromosomes. This was the first physical evidence that homologous chromosomes separated independently during meiosis, which is one source of genetic variation in sexually- reproducing organisms.  Later life  Carothers with a microscope Carothers retired from the University of Iowa in 1941 and moved from Iowa to Kingman, Kansas, where she continued to conduct research for the Woods Hole Marine Biological Lab. In 1954, she moved to Murdock, Kansas, where she lived and researched for the remainder of her life. Carothers died in 1957 at the age of 75.  Awards and honors  In 1921, Carothers was awarded the Ellen Richards Research Prize by the Naples Table Association. She received a starred entry for her work on grasshopper embryos in the fourth edition of American Men of Science, published in 1927, a rare and significant award for a female scientist at the time. Carothers was also elected to the National Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.

He chairs the Danish UN Association‚Äôs Peace and Conflict resolution committee and serves on the executive board. He is best known in the Danish public for arguing that Denmark should not participate in military actions without a UN mandate. He strongly supports Danish participation in the UN's efforts to promote peace including establishing a permanent UN peace force. He grew up in Malm√∂ in Sweden but is from a Danish-Norwegian family. Lave Knud Broch has a Master of Science degree in Political Science from University of Copenhagen. He is also a member of the Danish Social Liberal Party and was a European Parliament candidate for the first time in 1994.  Political views  Lave Broch is a social liberal. His opinions are for example: A living and involving democracy with openness in the government must be promoted and defended. He believes that the best society can be created if all humans are empowered and have access to high standards of welfare, education and social security. Human life and the nature is precious for him. Therefore conflict prevention or soft military peace solutions should be attempted in the worlds conflict areas. For Lave Broch international cooperation is crucial. He is a strong supporter of the UN but building an EU super state he believes is the wrong path. The EU contains little to no democracy and works for interests that are damaging to peace, welfare and the environment, which is why Denmark needs to opt out and seek a united Scandinavian/Nordic solution and EFTA membership instead. Lave Broch was also active in the Danish euro referendum and does not support that kronen (the Danish currency) is tied to the euro. And lastly Lave Broch is pro ecology and green solutions for example sustainable energy over nuclear plants and against EU initiatives that weaken national standards for organic products and the environment. Conflict resolution Lave Broch's is against the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and warned that it would lead to many civilian casualties and that no sustainable solutions were presented. He was also against the Iraq war because the lack of a UN mandate. The fight against Taliban in Afghanistan is for example wrong because the western coalition cooperates with suspected war criminals, the civil losses are too great and the use of torture as a means of interrogation. Which is why Lave Broch argues for undeniable human rights in war and any other circumstances, that cannot be bent in times of distress without consequences. Lave Broch also argues that EU actions have been damaging in different conflict situations. For instance he mentions that the EU did not listen to the UN secretary general concerning the recognition of Croatia. Even though the UN secretary general warned that a fast recognition could lead to \\"the most terrible war\\" in Bosnia and Hercegovina. Therefore Lave Broch would rather see issues which are currently solved by military means solved by conflict prevention and arbitration or at the very least a united UN military force, that do not promote special, national or economical interests. The first step is humanitarian aid with food, camps etc. The second step is objective UN observers in conflict zones. And the third step is negotiations. Lave Broch also opposes the EU's close connections to the European weapons industry. Where accelerating export of weapons is common practice, selling weapons to dictators is common practice, and the EU being the second largest exporter of weapons globally is a fact according to Lave Broch. Scandinavian cooperation Lave Broch would rather see a united Scandinavian/Nordic cooperation than EU and he believes that a Nordic league could be an advantage for the development in the world. The united Nordic cooperation would with a combined view on environment, legal policy, foreign policy and trade increase the collected voice of Nordic countries, BT (a daily Danish newspaper) writes about Lave Broch in an article in 2014 after a poll showed that 47% of Denmark would prefer such an arrangement. Ecology Lave Broch thinks ecology and sustainable energy is a must if future generations are to survive and in order to protect nature. This is why Lave Broch in a blog on Altinget is troubled by EU's constant invasion of national sovereignty, because in Denmark's case it weakens the current standards for no apparent reason by force undermining the Danish organic brand \\"√ò-m√¶rke\\". In order to promote ecology the national state needs to set standards in their own pace and not by the EU lowering Danish standards.

As such, it became involved in the Manhattan Project's program of testing bombs and aircraft under the codename Project W-47. History By early 1944, the role of the United States Army Air Forces had moved away from defense and preparing new units. Some 90 per cent of the planned units had been activated, and three-quarters of them had already deployed overseas. The Air Forces therefore shifted to the training of replacement aircrew and special projects like the Boeing B-29 Superfortress program. It was found that the existing system of units with fixed establishments was not sufficiently flexible for the Air Forces new roles, so in February 1944 Army Air Forces Headquarters ordered the units at each installation to be consolidated into Army Air Forces Base Units. The 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit was formed at Wendover Army Airfield in Utah, where it supported the 72d Fighter Wing, a formation responsible for training pilots of P-47 Thunderbolts. The base covered , and was the largest bombing and gunnery range in the world. By September 1944, when Lieutenant Colonel Paul Tibbets visited Wendover for the first time, this training program was ending, and there was only one aircraft left. Tibbets had recently been selected to command the 509th Composite Group, although it had not yet been formed, and Wendover was one of three bases offered to him. He was shown around the base by Captain Thomas L. Karnes of the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit. Tibbets was particularly impressed by Wendover's remoteness. He noted that the runway was long enough to handle the B-29, and the hangars and maintenance facilities were good. The only drawback in his mind was that the base housing was inadequate. Tibbets selected Wendover without examining the other two sites. Tibbets established his headquarters at Wendover on 8 September, and the 393d Bombardment Squadron followed three days later. The 509th Composite Group was not activated until 17 December. At this point, some 800 personnel were transferred to the new group from the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit, including Karnes, who became the 509th Composite Group's adjutant. Wendover, codenamed \\"Kingman\\", became the Manhattan Project's Site K. A new commander, Colonel Clifford J. Heflin, arrived in January 1945 to assume command of the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit, and relieve Tibbets of some of his administrative burden. Like Tibbets, Heflin was a veteran pilot, having commanded the 801st Bombardment Group (Provisional) and the 492d Bombardment Group. As part of Operation Carpetbagger, this unit had air dropped agents, weapons and supplies to resistance fighters in German-occupied Europe.Dvorak. pp. 14‚Äì27 The 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit's special activities in support of the Manhattan Project were codenamed Project W-47. These were carried out by two special elements within the unit. Flight Test Section In February 1945, Heflin created the Flight Test Section to carry out testing with prototype bombs in the shape of the Little Boy and Fat Man bombs. It was originally equipped with five Silverplate B-29s, three flight crews and five maintenance crews. The Flight Test Section was commanded Major Clyde \\"Stan\\" Shields, who had piloted the \\"Pullman\\" prototype Silverplate B-29 in the initial drop tests at Muroc Army Air Field in February and March 1944. The Flight Test Section received five new Silverplate B-29s in April 1945. It retired three of its aircraft, and kept another three, leaving it with eight test aircraft. Test drop missions were initially flown by Shields and Heflin.To help out with an increasingly demanding schedule, four crews from the 393d Bombardment Squadron were made available. The Flight Test Section carried out 24 drop tests in June and 30 in July. About two-thirds of the June tests were with Fat Man shapes and the rest with Little Boy ones. In July, all but four of the tests were with Fat Man shapes, some with explosive-filled Pumpkin bombs. Test drops were carried out at Wendover, at the Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, and at Naval Auxiliary Air Station Salton Sea. Testing continued up to the last minute, with the Fat Man firing unit, known as the X-unit, only being successfully tested at Wendover on 4 August, and a final test of the X-unit was carried out six days later. One of the three B-29s that carried Fat Man assemblies to Tinian was from the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit's Flight Test Section. Special Ordnance Detachment To assemble bombs for the Flight Test Section, the 1st Ordnance Squadron, Special (Aviation) was activated on 6 March 1945 under the command of Captain Charles F. H. Begg. However, as part of the 509th Composite Group, it was scheduled to accompany the group to the Pacific Theater to assemble atomic and Pumpkin bombs for combat missions. The 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit began forming and training a Special Ordnance Detachment in January 1945 under the command of Captain Henry Roerkohl to take over the role of supporting the Flight Test Section. The two units worked together until the 1st Ordnance Squadron departed for Tinian in May 1945. In all, the Special Ordnance Detachment assembled 71 bombs between May and August 1945. It moved to Oxnard Field in September, where it was transferred to the Manhattan District's 9812th Technical Services Unit on 17 December 1945. This was later designated Sandia Base. The Special Ordnance Detachment took with it its special tools and equipment, and even some of its buildings. The test program resumed at Sandia in January 1946. For its services, the Special Ordnance Detachment was awarded a Meritorious Service Unit Plaque on 19 December 1945.

It is one of the best-preserved brochs in Scotland. Location Dun Troddan () stands on a level rock platform north of the Abhainn a‚ÄôGhlaine Bhig, in the lower reaches of Gleann Beag. It lies just north of the minor road leading south from Glenelg. It can be accessed via a steep path. The neighbouring broch of Dun Telve lies to the west, whilst the \\"semi-broch\\" known as Dun Grugaig is around to the southeast. History Dun Troddan was first sketched in about 1720 when it was still an intact tower. It is thought that it was over high in 1720, and it was described as being \\"by far the most entire of any in that Country\\". It was robbed for stone in 1722 during the construction of Bernera Barracks in Glenelg. The broch was visited by Thomas Pennant in 1772, and it was still a substantial structure, although it had lost the upper gallery by this time. It was cleared of \\"debris\\" without any supervision and consolidated by the Office of Works in the years between 1914 and 1920. The broch is now in the care of Historic Scotland. Description The broch consists of a drystone tower which measures around in diameter, and currently stands to a maximum height of . The external walls are thick at the base. The entrance is on the southwest side, and is now roofless. On the left side of the entrance passage is a small side-chamber, sometimes called a \\"guard cell\\". The broch has features now missing from Dun Telve; these include a number of postholes in the floor and a hearth. Built into the hearth is a broken quern-stone. The central court is an almost perfect circle with a diameter of . An internal doorway in the remaining high part of the wall provides access to a stairway. From here it is possible to ascend nine stairs to a first floor landing. The landing is long, at a height of above the central court. At the end of the landing can be seen the first step which would have led up the next flight of stairs.

Completed in 1948, it is the second in a series of six heads, painted from the winter of 1948 in preparation for a November 1949 exhibition at the Hanover Gallery, London.Russell, 38 The figure seems half human, half animal, and has disintegrated to an extent that, like the preceding Head I of the series, the entire upper head has disappeared leaving only mouth and jaw. The figure is set in a shallow pictorial space, and is positioned behind curtains that borrow from Titian's 1558 Portrait of Cardinal Filippo Archinto. The curtains are fastened at one point by a safety pin. John Russell sees the curtains as enclosing the figure, as if the walls of a prison or execution dock. Remarking on their dreary and drab appearance he further speculates that they seem \\"stiffened by fifty year's crasse of a tenth rate lodging-house; or they could be sliding shutters that has been pulled apart to admit a new victim.\\"Russell, 35 The painting's overall grisaille appearance give the impression of x-ray photographs, and the look may have been inspired by K.C.

The preserve contains oak woodlands, savanna, riparian areas, grassland, vernal pools, and an Ecology Pond, all of which support more than 200 bird species and numerous mammals, amphibians and reptiles. Location The CNP is located within Los Angeles city limits. The preserve's western edge abuts Los Angeles County's western border with Ventura County. The preserve is in the foothills of the Simi Hills. The following San Fernando Valley neighborhoods surround the preserve: Chatsworth, Chatsworth Lake Manor, and West Hills.Google Maps ‚Äì Chatsworth Nature Preserve The preserve is located at the former site of Chatsworth Reservoir, a former Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) water-storage facility. Nearby points of interest include Stoney Point, Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park, Santa Susana Field Laboratory, Burro Flats Painted Cave, and Minnie Hill Palmer House. Nature preserve designation In the 1990s, former Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, other community leaders, and environmental organizations worked together to create the Chatsworth Nature Preserve. The Los Angeles City Council passed City Ordinance #169723City of Los Angeles, Office of the City Clerk ‚Äì Ordinance 169723 (the Chatsworth Open Space Ordinance) in 1994, limiting use of the area encompassing the former Chatsworth Reservoir property to a nature preserve and related scientific studies and education. Key features=Wildlife More than 200 bird species inhabit the CNP. Resident bird species are greater roadrunner, California quail, woodpeckers, herons, egrets, orioles, ash-throated flycatchers, acorn woodpecker, Nuttall's woodpecker, western kingbird, great horned owl and others. Migratory birds include Canada goose, western meadowlark, tricolored blackbird, sapsuckers, and a variety of ducks and shorebirds. Raptors populating the preserve include ferruginous hawk, red- tailed hawk, prairie falcon, and many others. Notable amphibians and reptiles include western spadefoot toad, slender salamander, western skink, ring-necked snake, and red racer. The preserve's wildlife population includes large and small mammals: desert cottontail rabbit, gray fox, coyote, and raccoon, plus occasional bobcats, mountain lions, and mule deer.Carla Bollinger, Mark Osokow. Chatsworth Nature Preserve, Santa Susanna Mountain Park Association Newsletter, Fall 2012 , p. 2 Terrain Among the CNP's various natural habitats are oak woodlands and savanna, riparian areas, chaparral, grassland, pond water and fringing marsh, seasonal ponds, and vernal pools created by seasonal rains and streams, including Woolsey Canyon Creek and Box Canyon Creek, which drain into the preserve from the steep rocky Simi Hills. Inside the preserve, the now-channelized Chatsworth Creek, a tributary of the Los Angeles River, joins with Box Canyon Creek, Woolsey Canyon Creek, and additional unnamed creeks. Rocky hills rise out of the preserve, and earthen berms from former water-retention dams arc across the terrain. Ecology Pond The CNP Ecology Pond provides the only permanent source of water within the preserve and draws wildlife from throughout the area. In recent history it has served as habitat for a variety of dabbling ducks, diving ducks, herons, egrets, grebes, coots, cormorants, and shorebirds. The pond is the core for a complex of habitats along its shores, including mudflats during lower water periods, a fringing marsh of cattails, bulrushes, nettles, and other water-associated plants. On slightly higher ground, the pond waters also support dense thickets primarily of mule fat and willows that could not exist in drier areas. The pond, mudflats and marsh provide foraging, roosting, and nest sites for numerous bird species, and are used by various mammals, reptiles and amphibians. The thickets support breeding bird species.Chatsworth Nature Preserve/Reservoir Ecology Pond The Ecology Pond is also used as an emergency water supply source for fighting nearby wildfires. Fire department helicopters refill their water tanks with the pond's water. Designated Historical Site Chatsworth Reservoir Kiln Site The CNP contains Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #141,Office of Historic Resources ‚Äì Historic- Cultural Monument (HCM) List thus designated on April 2, 1975 by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission. Also known as the Chatsworth Calera, monument #141 is a centuries-old kiln used for burning limestone in the making of lime for concrete, mortar, and whitewash, a step in the construction of bricks and tiles. The monument now looks like a hole in the ground with walls of vitrified limestone and brick. It measures about fifteen feet deep and six and a half feet across. The kiln was in use during early California history (Spanish/Mission and Mexican periods). Rich in oak trees and lime deposits, the location was ideal for kiln operation. Several such lime kilns were in operation around the edge of the San Fernando Valley. The word \\"Calera\\" is Spanish for \\"limestone quarry\\" or \\"limekiln\\". Land management The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) owns and manages the CNP. A chain-link fence encloses most of the preserve's grounds. The LADWP limits general public access to the enclosed portion of the CNP to a once-yearly Earth Day celebration. History The CNP contains evidence of at least 1,000 years of human culture: native tribes made sacred use of the land, and the Fernande√±o and Chumash people ground acorns and seeds in the sandstone outcroppings. Spanish missionaries processed limestone for use in plaster coatings of adobe buildings, and in the 19th century the land was used by Mexican cattle ranchers and Basque sheepherders. Chatsworth Reservoir In the early 20th century, the City of Los Angeles developed a linked chain of 19 water-retention basins to store and manage water imported via the Los Angeles Aqueduct system from the Owens Valley. Chatsworth Reservoir was the last of these, and occupied the now-current CNP lands.Frank Moore Colby, Allen Leon Churchill. Google Books ‚Äì New International Yearbook: A Compendium of the World's Progress, p. 38 Placed into service in 1919, the reservoir was created by two large earth-filled dams and two smaller dikes spanning gaps between hills. From 1920 to 1950 it was the main water storage facility for the western San Fernando Valley, primarily serving agricultural irrigation needs. During that period, dam improvements increased water capacity from the initial 7,400 acre-feet to 9,840 acre-feet. As the West San Fernando Valley shifted away from agriculture toward suburban housing, reservoir use shifted toward domestic water supply, requiring reservoir improvements to address water quality issues related to storm water runoff, algae and aquatic plant growth in shallow bays, and wind-propelled waves which stirred up mud. Construction related to these improvements began in the spring of 1969. After the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, the California Department of Water Resources Division of Safety of Dams directed a stability investigation of all hydraulic-fill dams in California, including the Chatsworth Reservoir dams. The analysis determined that the Chatsworth dams would have to be completely rebuilt in order to be safe during a major earthquake. In 1972 the reservoir was drained and taken out of service. No schedule for reconstructing the Chatsworth Reservoir has been established.Welcome to Chatsworth Reservoir ‚Äì History and Status of Chatsworth Reservoir Film history The CNP was a popular filming location, as was true for several neighboring areas and ranches. The locale's rugged rock outcroppings, boulders, canyons, majestic oak trees, grasslands and lake featured prominently in \\"B\\" westerns, also known as \\"oaters\\". Movies filmed on the land now designated as the CNP include The Ten Commandments, Donovan's Brain, The Palomino, Susanna Pass, Sioux City Sue, Man from Rainbow Valley, Out California Way, Home on the Range, Hell's Angels, Tess of the Storm Country, Three Word Brand, and The Karate Kid. Television shows filmed there include The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin, Rin Tin Tin II, and The Dukes of Hazzard.

When the funding came through years later, he was forced to re-cast because of Smollett's busy schedule on Empire, and struggled to find a black male actor who would portray a gay love story on screen. However, he later met Julian Walker, who is openly gay, and chose to cast him despite his lack of acting experience. Polk discussed, in an interview with BuzzFeed, the need for more stories featuring gay men who aren't white: > \\"Through my years of filmmaking, we have seen the gay coming-of-age story > from every possible white male point of view ... We‚Äôve seen it over, and > over, and over.‚Äù  Release  The film had a successful run on the film festival circuit, winning awards at several LGBT-oriented festivals including Outflix Memphis, Atlanta‚Äôs Out On Film Festival, and the Crossroads Film Festival in Polk‚Äôs native Mississippi.

Construction The San Esteban Apedreado was a fifth- rate frigate built in the Guarnizo shipyard near Santander, Spain, by Lorenzo Arzueta. Her length was , keel , beam and depth in the hold . She displaced 625 tons. She carried eighteen 12-pounder guns on the lower gun deck, eighteen 8-pounder guns on the upper gun deck, and four 4-pounder guns on the quarterdeck. As of 1741 she had a crew of 350. Career The San Esteban Apedreado was acquired by the Spanish navy in 1726. In 1730 she was stationed at Havana. She sailed from Havana on 26 May 1731 carrying 4,000,000 pesos and reached C√°diz on 14 July 1731. In October 1731 she carried troops from Cadiz to Livorno with the fleet of the Marquis del Mari. She returned to Cadiz to be careened in February 1732. The San Esteban Apedreado left Cadiz in 1736 and sailed to Buenos Aires. On 18 August 1736 she was engaged with a Portuguese ship carrying 60 guns for two hours. On 26 August 1736 she captured the Portuguese frigate Madre de Dios. On 15 January 1737 she was back at Buenos Aires. In April that year she was in the Rio de la Plata with the Hermione, San Francisco Javier and Paloma Indiana. She left for Spain with the Hermione in 1739 carrying 600,000 pesos. The San Esteban Apedreado and Hermione reached Ferrol, Galicia, in 1740 and entered Cadiz in April 1740. Last voyage The San Est√©ban Apedreado left Ferrol on 7 October 1740 in Vice-Admiral Jos√© Alfonso Pizarro's squadron, but was forced back due to bad weather, The squadron left Ferrol again on 21 October 1740. In 1741 a fleet under Commodore Anson left England to attack the coasts of Chile and Peru. The Spanish government ordered General Jos√© Pizarro to respond with his squadron consisting of the ships Asia (64), Guip√∫zcoa (74), Hermione (54) and Esperanza (50) and the frigate San Est√©ban (40). At the end of February the squadron was just west of Cape Horn when it was dispersed by a violent storm. With continuing poor weather the San Est√©ban was forced to return to the Rio de la Plata. On her arrival she ran ashore. She was recovered, but had been badly damaged. She was broken up in 1744.

Although VideoBrain generated major excitement and strong orders when it was introduced at the January 1978 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), consumers did not adopt it as readily as hoped. The company halted manufacturing in the spring of 1979 and was folded into the structure of its largest financial backer, the Cha Group. History Umtech was founded in 1976 by Dr. Albert Yu, an integrated circuit engineering manager at Intel who became Umtech‚Äôs President, and Dr. David Chung who led development of the F8 processor for Fairchild Semiconductor. It was based in Sunnyvale, California.The company was backed financially by Dr. Yu‚Äôs father-in-law, Cha Chi Ming, the principal of the Cha Group headquartered in Hong Kong. Some employees of the company later became minor shareholders through the exercise of employee stock options.Haynes The company created the name VideoBrain for the computer it developed and then used the name VideoBrain Computer Company in marketing.Haynes Technology=Integrated circuits The company developed two chips to facilitate displaying the computer‚Äôs output on a standard color television set. The UM1 chip controlled sixteen rectangular objects on the screen that could be manipulated in size and shape, placement on the screen, and image within the rectangle. Software could designate the color of the image and of the remaining space within the rectangle, usually the background color of the display which was also software selectable. The UM1 was in turn controlled by an F8 processor. The UM1 fed a stream of pixels into a FIFO buffer which passed them along to be converted into signals that were delivered to the RF antenna input of a television set. Because the UM1 delivered the pixels needed for every line on the raster scan of the TV, rather than using the same pixel stream for every two or more adjacent lines as in then current video games, the VideoBrain produced finer display resolution than most television sets could support. The UM1 chip (Patent #4,232,374) was designed by John Cosley and Len Chen under the direction of Dr. Chung.Cosley A second chip, the UM2, was developed to serve as a clock for the entire system and to produce the NTSC (USA) and PAL (Europe) scanning video frames for the TV set. The PAL version of the UM2 was never manufactured or brought to market. Though a much simpler chip than the UM1, getting the UM2 into manufacturing was difficult because any flaw in timing, even once in millions of cycles, could bring the entire system down.Cosley The masks used to create the proprietary chips were drawn by hand. The company tested its chips using its own stepper and chip tester. Hardware and system design Cartridge Carrier Open Like the later Apple MacIntosh, the VideoBrain did not allow the user to open the case and insert hardware components. Like the Commodore PET the keyboard was built into the computer. Taking a lesson from videogames, VideoBrain was the first home or personal computer where software programs were stored on ROM chips and loaded into the system in cartridges. This was much easier and more reliable for consumers than loading software from cassette tapes or the notoriously fallible 5.25‚Äù diskettes.VideoBrain User Manual Bottom View of Cartridge In addition to the F8 processor and the proprietary chips, the system contained 1K of RAM and 1K of resident software on ROM. Though the computer‚Äôs capabilities were very limited by today‚Äôs standards, it is impressive how much the developers were able to accomplish with this seemingly minuscule amount of memory.Cosley VideoBrain featured a non-standard keyboard with 36 keys and a reset button labeled ‚ÄúMaster Control‚Äù. The keys were level with each other and had very little travel when they were struck. This made typing somewhat difficult and also emphasized to anyone familiar with computers that the system‚Äôs capabilities were limited.Haynes Back Panel of Computer The system supported four plug-in joysticks and a port on the back that could connect to an extender product using proprietary signaling over an RS-232 physical interfaces. The extender product, and ROM cartridge that turned VideoBrain into a timeshare terminal, were sold in very small quantities. Other connections on the back panel were to the television display and to the external AC transformer. A switch on the back panel directed the TV signal to channel 3 or channel 4.VideoBrain User Manual The motherboard was enclosed in a metal shield to meet Federal Communications Commission requirements for limiting radio frequency emissions. The external case was molded plastic, designed for low-cost high-volume manufacturing.Cosley Software Software Cartridge with Box and Manual The code was written in F-8 Assembly language, and then run through a translator/assembler on a Hewlett-Packard minicomputer to produce binary machine code. The resident 1K ROM contained basic start-up and operating code, images of letters and numbers, and four user-accessible programs ‚Äì text, clock, alarm, and color.Shapero Umtech developed and marketed fourteen software programs, six in the Education Series, six in the Entertainment Series, and two in the Money Management Category. The company developed but never offered for sale a cartridge with 1k of onboard RAM that made the computer programmable in a variation of the APL language, and an educational program called Old Regime that allowed users to simulate being a wealthy landowner in seventeenth century France.Haynes/Shapero A list of software programs can be found here Packaging, distribution, and marketing The company never sold the computer by itself but always packaged it as a ‚Äúsystem‚Äù with some software cartridges. The System 100, with three cartridges, sold for $500. The systems were initially delivered in a colorful, consumer-oriented box. The box was later changed to a larger, plainer, box to better protect the computer from shock.Haynes The progress of marketing and sales can be seen in the following timeline:Haynes * January 1977 ‚Äì Marketing research trip to Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Chicago * Spring, 1977 ‚Äì Umtech first meets with a manufacturer‚Äôs rep and with Interstate Electronics, an electronics distributor that becomes an important business partner Traveling Prototype for Demonstrating Capabilities * April 1977 ‚Äì Umtech meets with a German distributor at the Hannover Messe industrial fair. Presents a mockup of the product and demonstrates software capabilities using a portable breadboard. * June 1977 ‚Äì Umtech meets with RadioShack and other retailers in a hotel suite at the CES show in Las Vegas. * January 1978 ‚Äì Umtech introduces VideoBrain to an enthusiastic response on the show floor at the winter CES show in Las Vegas. All aspects of marketing are high quality and professional ‚Äì product packaging, show booth, brochures, displays, and employee presentations. The company garners more orders at the show ($2.5 million) than Apple.Moynihan Orders come from Federated Department Stores (Macy‚Äôs, Bloomingdale's), Associated Dry Goods (Lord & Taylor, Robinsons, Goldwater's), Nordstrom and from many other department stores, computer stores, and electronics retailers.Moynihan * February 1978 ‚Äì VideoBrain, presented by a representative of Interstate, appears on The Today Show with Jane Pauly. The computer is introduced at retail with a special promotion in a dedicated room at Macy's San Francisco.Haynes Macy's later reports that it was the biggest sales day in the electronics department in the history of Macy's.Moynihan * March 1978 ‚Äì VideoBrain begins shipping but many department stores have cancelled their orders due to the absence of shipments since January. * June 1978 ‚Äì VideoBrain appears again in a booth at the CES show. * January 1979 ‚Äì VideoBrain does not appear on the floor at CES. Some manufacturer‚Äôs reps do not even pick up their commission checks from the Umtech hotel suite. Umtech was introduced to Interstate Electronics, a distributor of consumer electronics located in Chicago, Illinois, and to a major distributor of consumer electronics in Germany by a Hong Kong businessman, Raymond Koo of Raitronics, who sold other products to these companies. Umtech also sold directly to some computer stores, like Computerland, and through manufacturer‚Äôs representatives. The rep that may have achieved the most success sold VideoBrain to military PX‚Äôs. Umtech‚Äôs first advertising agency was Regis McKenna in Palo Alto, which also handled advertising for Intel and Apple. After the 1978 CES show, Apple insisted that the agency resign the Umtech account, which it did. Umtech then hired Wilton, Coombs & Colnett of San Francisco. To pull the product through retailers, Umtech advertised the product in popular and computer-oriented magazines. VideoBrain's first position as a \\"family computer\\" was changed to \\"home computer\\" during 1978. In both cases the suggestion of multiple users within a household sought to justify the price of the product. Facilities and manufacturing The company began research and development in 1976 in David Chung‚Äôs living room in Palo Alto, California then moved in October to a small space on Sobrante Way in Sunnyvale. In 1977 the company moved to larger facilities on Wolfe Road in Sunnyvale and later added adjoining space in the same building. Here the company began low volume manufacturing. In 1978 Umtech moved to larger space on Patrick Henry Drive in Santa Clara and set up a volume manufacturing facility. When the company cut back its operations and moved to a small space in Palo Alto, it very profitably sub-leased the Patrick Henry facility to ROLM. Employees At one point in 1979 Umtech grew to over 100 employees.Memo to Managers July 26, 1978 Key managers and personnel included the following: * Dr. Albert Yu \\\\- President * David Chung - Vice President of Engineering and Marketing * John Cosley ‚Äì Chief Chip, Hardware, and System Engineer * Len Chen ‚Äì Chip Design Engineer * Bob Frankovich ‚Äì Director of Design Automation * Niall Shapero ‚Äì Senior Software Engineer * Pavel Stoffel ‚Äì Senior Software Engineer * Mike Hall - Senior Software Engineer * Bruce Mackay ‚Äì Director of Manufacturing * Bob Samuel - Manufacturing Engineer * Ed Alemany - Customer Service Manager * Richard Melmon ‚Äì Director of Marketing * Darhsiung (Dash) Chang ‚Äì Product Manager * Ted Haynes ‚Äì Marketing Manager and Product Manager Umtech‚Äôs place in personal computer history VideoBrain was a visionary attempt to skip years ahead in personal computers - before consumers were ready for it and before technology was prepared to support the vision. Although the public was largely oblivious to microcomputers in the late seventies, there were business people who believed passionately that personal computers would be an enormous market with tremendous impact. They were right in the long run but they were ahead of their time. VideoBrain was the first personal computer to make loading and running software easy and reliable. In an era when floppy disks were uncommon and expensive, VideoBrain loaded software via ROM cartridges. VideoBrain was the first personal computer to be packaged and sold through department stores as a consumer product. Unfortunately the idea of buying and using a computer (or even touching it in the store) was intimidating to most consumers. To those familiar with computers, VideoBrain did not offer enough capability and flexibility to be useful. It could not be user programmed, the keyboard was limited, and the 1K of RAM could not be expanded. On the other hand, VideoBrain was too expensive to compete with video games. While consumer channels regrouped after VideoBrain, personal computer manufacturers turned their attention from hobbyists to business. It seems the Apple MacIntosh capitalized on Umtech‚Äôs experience a few years later when it came out as a system where the user was not expected to open the case to add or delete hardware. With glamorous marketing, Apple made consumers comfortable that, as intended for VideoBrain, they could bring a computer home, plug it in, and use it easily.

Benedicks was a professor at Stockholm's technical university, Director of the Institute of Metallography, and was the first to study the yttrium silicate thalenite. In 1926 Benedicks argued to the Nobel Physics Committee that Jean Baptiste Perrin should receive the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work, over 15 years prior, on Brownian motion, a debate which led to Perrin's eventual nomination and award. Benedicks was awarded the Carnegie Gold medal for his work on the cooling power of liquids, quenching velocities, and the constituents of troostite and austenite. Benedicks was critical of the Copenhagen interpretation put forward by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, saying he thought they had resigned themselves to never observing the effects of individual atoms, and that their arguments were no more than that of any pessimist.

In this season's February 19, 2015 episode, \\"The Comic Book Store Regeneration\\", Howard Wolowitz receives a phone call that his mother has died while visiting family in Florida.  Production  In February 2014, CBS CEO Leslie Moonves confirmed an eighth season, when announcing that the first part of the new season would air on a different night, due to CBS acquiring the rights to Thursday Night Football games. In May 2014, CBS announced at its annual upfront presentation, that the series would begin its eighth season on Mondays, before returning to the Thursday slot it has held since 2010 on October 30, once the football games end.  Delay  Production for the season was expected to begin on July 30, 2014, however the start was delayed due to the five main cast members' desire to renegotiate new contracts, with Johnny Galecki, Jim Parsons and Kaley Cuoco seeking approximately $1 million per episode, as well as more backend money. Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar negotiated together, separate from Galecki, Parsons and Cuoco's negotiations. Production was officially delayed on July 30, due to the contract negotiations, and was rescheduled for August 6, 2014. On August 4, Galecki, Parsons and Cuoco signed new contracts, worth $1 million per episode for three years, with the possibility to extend for a fourth year. The deals also include larger pieces of the show, signing bonuses, production deals and advances towards the back-end. The following day, Helberg and Nayyar renegotiated their contracts, giving them a per-episode pay in the \\"mid six- figure range\\", up from around $100,000 per episode they each received in years prior. The first table read for season 8 took place on August 6.  Premiere  The first episode of season 8, \\"The Locomotion Interruption\\", first aired in the US on September 22, 2014. In Australia, season 8 premiered on October 13, 2014. In the UK, \\"The Locomotion Interruption\\" first aired on October 23, 2014.

He is generally referred to as The Elder to distinguish him from his son Eduard, who was also a painter.  Biography  View from M√∂nchsberg to Hoher G√∂ll Schleich was the illegitimate son of the judicial administrator at Schloss Haarbach. In 1833, after the death of his father left him destitute, he went to Munich with the intention of enrolling at the Academy of Fine Arts, but was told he had no artistic talent and was rejected. As a result, he began to paint landscapes on his own, modelling them on the works of Christian Etzdorf, Christian Morgenstern and Carl Rottmann. He then took inspiration from the Dutch Masters, and strove for a greater expression of mood rather than pictorial representation. Travels in Germany, France and Italy broadened his horizons, but he still mostly painted Bavarian landscapes. He increasingly focused on the play of atmospheric processes and objects became the mere carriers of light and color. He often finished a canvas in a single day. In 1851, he took a study trip to Paris, together with Carl Ebert, Dietrich Langko and Carl Spitzweg. He not only wanted to study the old masters in the Louvre, but discover the latest styles then being developed there as well. Eventually, Schleich became a professor at the Academy which had spurned him. He was also a member of the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna and the Academy of Fine Arts Stockholm. In 1850, he was elected to the board of the Munich Kunstverein and oversaw the First International Exhibition at the Glaspalast. Many of his best paintings are in the Neue Pinakothek in Munich. From the 1840s until his death (from cholera), he stayed sporadically at the village of Dachau outside Munich, which was becoming popular with landscape artists and would later have a full-fledged art colony.

His specialty is the making of large cooking vessels called ‚Äúcazuelas,‚Äù traditionally used to cook mole and rice, but he also makes a number of other utilitarian and decorative pieces. His work has been recognized with awards such as the Gran Premio de Arte Popoular from FONART in 1999 and being named a ‚Äúgrand master‚Äù by the Fomento Cultural Banamex in 2003. Life Camacho Quiroz is a fourth generation potter, learning the craft from his parents. Both his parents worked in clay, with his father specializing in the making of incense burners and small items such as cups. His mother specialized in large cooking pots called ‚Äúcazuelas,‚Äù traditionally used for making mole and rice. He began working in clay as a small child, helping his mother create cups and other small vessels which provides most of the family‚Äôs income at the time. They shaped pieces from Monday to Friday, with firing done on weekends and sell and even trade them for other goods at the traditional ‚Äútianguis‚Äù market in Metepec. Camacho Quiroz continued working in ceramics even though he attended university. He left school when his parents died, first his father and soon after, his mother. All of his siblings also learned to work in clay and relied on it for income at some point in their lives, but today only the boys of the family are still potters. Today, the artisan works with his wife and children. His wife, Ivette Camacho Rodriguez, studied ceramics at the Centro Cultural MOA. She makes pieces in Talavera style and has won awards in competitions in Metepec and with FONART. She also teaches her techniques to pre schoolers. His two children also work in ceramics and have participated in artistic competitions for youth organized by the government of Metepec. Career Camacho Quiroz is best known for his large cazuela cooking pots, which are a traditional ware in Metepec. Most of his income derives from them, but most are not sold for cooking but rather as decorative elements and can be found on walls in homes, restaurants and offices. He also makes large and small flowerpots, jugs for serving pulque and various other utilitarian and decorative pieces. Certain pieces, such as trees of life, are made only to order. His work can be found part of the collections of the Frankfurt Museum and other museums in Europe. He regularly competes in Metepec‚Äôs most important competition, the Leyendas Vivientes de FONART. The artisan has won various important recognitions for his work such as the Gran Premio de Arte Popoular from FONART in 1999, and awards at the Premio Nacional de Arte Popular in Oaxaca and the Concurso Nacional de Cer√°mica in Tlaquepaque, Jalisco. He was named a ‚Äúgrand master‚Äù by the Fomento Cultural Banamex in 2003. Artistry Camacho Quiroz works with red and yellow clays mined from the nearby town of Ocotitl√°n. He cleans the masses and along with others in this town, engages in the tradition of laying the clays on the street to be pulverized by passing cars. The final grinding to a powder is done by hand with a heavy stone in small quantities. To work the clay into forms, it is first wetted and then ‚Äúplumilla‚Äù cattail fluff is added as a temper. Certain pieces, such as flowerpots are made using molds, pressing thin ‚Äúpancakes‚Äù of clay into shape. Then pieces are dried in the sun before being smoothed with stones and other tools. Firing is done in a circular kiln. The first time is done terra cotta and the second is done after painting and glazing. His specialty is the making of large, heavy cooking vessels called ‚Äúcazuelas.‚Äù As many of his pieces are used for decoration, motifs are important. Turkeys appear frequently as a decorative element in his work, ‚Äúas a traditional sign of America.‚Äù He also paints butterflies, as symbols of perfection and strength. Other designs include various plants, animals and flowers. He changed to non-leaded glazes in order to be able to sell his ware more widely in Mexico and abroad. He has been experimenting with ceramics of higher temperatures and other techniques, combining them with more traditional ones.

The port is from the border with China and close to the border with North Korea. A railway line from the port connects to railway lines running north to Vladivostok, west to Hunchun of Jilin Province in China where a high speed rail terminus is operational, and south to Rajin in North Korea via Khasan, respectively. It is ice-free year round. History Port of Zarubino originated from the construction of a fishing industry sea port which began in 1972. In June 1973, the Order of \\" Primorrybproma \\" from 06.01.1973 Direction was formed under construction fishing port \\"Trinity\\". In July 1981, the Order of the All-Union Association of the Far Eastern fishery basin ( VRPO \\" Dalryba \\") dated 01.06.1981 in the village formed the Zarubino enterprise Sea Fishing Port Trinity. In December 1988, in accordance with the order of the USSR Ministry of Fisheries from 01.12.1988 ‚Ññ450 Enterprise \\"Sea Fishing Port \\" Trinity \\" \\" was renamed \\"Khasan fishing port\\". In April 1992, the Order of the Government of Russia from 15.04.1992 ‚Ññ 739- p Khasan sea commercial port Trinity Bay was opened to foreign vessels.

Development There are prospects of development of the Zarubino seaport through either the construction of new or expansion of existing port infrastructure. In February 2014 plans were announced for construction of a grain terminal with capacity of 5 million tons in a joint venture of United Grain Company with Dalport, an affiliate of multi-industry holding Summa Group of Russia. It is planned to bring the total volume of cargo handling in the seaport to 10 million tons and to supply grain to the Asia-Pacific region, including by increasing the processing of rolling cargo (cars and other equipment), fish and containers not only Russian export-import, but also for the purposes of transit, from north to south China and from China to Korea.Russian deputy PM supports building grain corridor in Far East In May 2014 Jilin province of China and the Summa Group signed a cooperative agreement about development of the port at the fourth Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA), held in Shanghai. The scheme would expand port capacity to 60 million tonnes of cargo per year. The first phase is due to be completed by 2018 allowing for 500,000 twenty foot equivalent units containers and 10 million tonnes of grain and cargo per year.

The Russian community is a growing population and constitutes a major source of new immigrants to the city. Historically the Russian community was centered in East Baltimore, but most Russians now live in Northwest Baltimore's Arlington neighborhood and in Baltimore's suburb of Pikesville. Demographics In 1920, 4,632 foreign-born White people in Baltimore spoke the Russian language, many of them being Russian-speaking Jews. Russian was the second most widely spoken Slavic or Eastern European language in the city after the Polish language. In the 1930 United States Census, Russian-Americans were the largest foreign-born group in Baltimore. In that year 17,500 Russian-born immigrants lived in the city and more than 24,000 Baltimoreans were of Russian parentage. In 1940, 14,670 immigrants from the Soviet Union lived in Baltimore, many of whom were of Russian descent. These immigrants comprised 24.1% of the city's foreign-born white population. During the 1990s around 8,208 immigrants settled in Baltimore from Russia, Ukraine, and other countries of the former Soviet Union. The Russian community in the Baltimore metropolitan area numbered 35,763 as of 2000, making up 1.4% of the area's population. In the same year Baltimore city's Russian population was 5,526, 0.8% of the city's population. 19,430 Russians live in adjacent Baltimore County and in total 7.2% of the Baltimore metropolitan area's foreign-born population is Russian- American. According to the 2000 Census, the Russian language was spoken at home by 1,235 people in Baltimore. As of 2005, the Baltimore region had the 15th-largest Russian-speaking population in the United States. In 2013, an estimated 5,647 Russian-Americans resided in Baltimore city, 0.9% of the population. As of September 2014, immigrants from Russia were the twenty-sixth largest foreign-born population in Baltimore and the Russian language was the seventh most spoken language other than English. History Shaarei Tfiloh Synagogue, in March 2012. Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church, a Russian Orthodox church in Dunbar, Baltimore, February 2018. Most Russian immigrants to Baltimore have been Russian Jews. In the 1930 United States Census there were 17,000 Russians living in the city, most of whom were Jewish. In comparison to Baltimore's wealthy and assimilated German Jews, Russian Jews were largely poor and lived in slums with other Russians. The German-Russian divide among Baltimore's Jewry lead many Jews from Russia to associate more with the Russian community than the wider Jewish community. Baltimore's Russian community, including Russian Jews, was originally centered in Southeast Baltimore. The largest wave of Russian-Jewish immigrants to Baltimore occurred during the 1880s. A second wave of Russian-Jewish immigrants came during the 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. During the 1930s, Russians were the largest foreign-born population in Baltimore. In the 1960 United States Census, Russian Jews comprised 18.2% of Baltimore's population. By 1940, Russian Jews were the majority in 13 of Baltimore's census tracts. Russian Jews helped establish several synagogues in Baltimore, including the B'nai Israel Synagogue and the Shaarei Tfiloh Synagogue. While most people of Russian descent in Baltimore are Jewish, a significant minority are Christians, mostly from the Russian Orthodox Church. Ethnic Russians from Belarus established the Transfiguration of our Lord Russian Orthodox Church in 1963 in order to serve the needs of the Russian Orthodox community. Russian Orthodox Christians also established the Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church. To facilitate the integration of Russian immigrants into American society, the Baltimore branch of the HIAS established a bilingual Russian-English newspaper titled The News Exchange in May, 1978. In the 1990 United States Census over 30,000 people of Russian descent lived in Baltimore and Baltimore County. At the time, over 400 Russian-speaking people settled in the Baltimore area each year. Ze Mean Bean Caf√© in Fell's Point opened in 1995. It is a restaurant which offers Russian cuisine, as well as other Slavic and Eastern European fare. Culture National Slavic Museum in Fell's Point, June 2014. In 1995 a biweekly Russian language newspaper titled Kaskad (Cascade) was founded by a Russian-speaking Jewish immigrant from Belarus. As of 1995, the Baltimore area was home to several Russian grocery stores, a Russian language magazine, and a Russian language radio program. An annual Russian Festival is held at the Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church in October. The festival celebrates Russian heritage, history, and cuisine. The National Slavic Museum opened in 2012. The museum focuses on the Slavic history of Baltimore, including Baltimore's Russian history. The Lemko House, an apartment complex on South Ann Street, provides housing for Eastern European immigrants. Founded in 1983 by Ivan Dornic, an Eastern Rite priest, the complex is named after Dornic's ethnic group, the Lemkos. The Lemkos are a Rusyn ethnic group inhabiting Lemkivshchyna, a part of Transcarpathia that spans parts of Slovakia, Poland, and Ukraine. Lemko House has opened its doors to low-income residents of any ethnicity, but is still home to many Slavic and Eastern European immigrants, including Russians.

Today, that size, known as standard, is not used by any professional player for professional match play. The Fortissimo was shown in 1972 at the \\"Spoga\\", a sporting goods show in Germany. Its designer is Kurt Klemmer, who made the racquet with an epoxy fiberglass process. The Fortissimo was not produced on a commercial scale, with twelve having been made. Racquet engineer Siegfried Kuebler stated that it did not create a favorable impression with tennis players but was positively received by racquet designers.Siegfried Kuebler - Racquet Collector and Engineer (via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine -- July 18th 2009 snapshot) At the time, there was resistance to large-headed racquets. The belief was that they made the game too easy and were a form of cheating or crutch. This belief was held not only by many amateurs but also by many professionals, such as Martina Navratilova, who, in 1980, argued in favor of banning all racquets larger than standard for making the game too easy. Rod Laver, John McEnroe, and others agreed but tennis authorities allowed even very large-headed racquets. The Fortissimo emerged two years prior to the filing of the influential and lucrative patent for racquets sized 95-135 square inches by Prince Sporting Goods (now Prince Sports and commonly called Prince). This resulted in the disqualification of the patent by the German patent authority.Siegfried Kuebler - Racquet Collector and Engineer (via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine -- July 18th 2009 snapshot) The Prince patent was upheld elsewhere and the company became the only highly-successful seller of oversize racquets in their early history. The first was the very flexible aluminum Prince Classic of 1976. The surprise success of Pam Shriver at the 1978 US Open, where she not only became the youngest finalist in its history but also defeated the number one seed to reach the final, was a key factor in the proliferation of the Prince racquet. Tad Weed introduced the first super- oversize in 1975, to start a line that continues to be sold today.  Materials Shift Impact  Although metal racquets became popular in the 1970s, beginning with the invention of the 1963 Lacoste steel racquet that became the extremely successful Wilson T2000, synthetic materials, beginning with fiberglass and culminating in graphite, would eventually completely displace them from all but the low-budget recreational line sold in generalist stores such as Walmart. The Yamaha Corporation saw success in the marketplace in the 1970s and early 1980s with fiberglass racquets made with the small \\"standard\\" head size such as the YFG 10. Several other companies introduced racquets made just with fiberglass as well, such as Caldon and Head. As with the Yamaha, these were made with the standard head size. The Fortissimo, however, was made with the new oversize head size, using the improved resistance to warpage (when compared with wood) and lighter weight (when compared with metal) of fiberglass. Fiberglass never achieved market dominance, though, as wood racquets with graphite layering and metal racquets, including oversize models, continued to find popularity. Graphite, which offered better stiffness and resistance to cracking than fiberglass, eventually displaced all other materials as the primary constituent material of a tennis racquet. The change from the \\"standard\\" (the smallest) racquet head size, which was used until the 1970s by all tennis players, to larger sizes is considered to be the most dramatic in terms of tennis racquet technology change by some tennis historians. However, the materials shift from soft wood to stiffer, lighter, and more warp-resistant materials (culminating in graphite), which generally accompanied the transition to larger head sizes, also is paramount in terms of impact.An Evolutionary History of Tennis Racquets As oversize wooden racquets have a strong tendency to warp and also lack solidity when produced at a playable weight, only one was produced, the Prince Woodie, which had many layers of graphite to improve its stability. That racquet was used successfully by male and female professionals, such as Gabriela Sabatini and professionals in development, such as Tommy Haas. Although it offered very little power, when compared with a graphite racquet, due to its flexibility, it absorbed ball shock well due to its wood construction, making it an excellent racquet for training. Similarly, fiberglass was quite flexible, like wood. The desire for more power led to graphite eventually completely displacing fiberglass, although graphite racquets with approximately 20% fiberglass were produced long after 100% fiberglass racquets disappeared from the market.  Size Shift Impact  No professional tennis player has used the small \\"standard\\" racquet head size since the 1980s for a professional match, with nearly all players having switched to a midsize or larger frame by 1984. However, even today, few professionals use an oversize racquet, preferring a midplus or super midplus. That size is smaller than that of an oversize (which is typically 110 square inches) and larger than that of a midsize (which is typically 90 square inches). The only active professional player to use a midsize recently is Roger Federer, who switched to a larger racquet at the end of 2013.Seeking Bigger Sweet Spot, Roger Federer Hopes His Racket Will Grow on Him Oversize and larger racquets are generally used by older recreational players, as a way to reduce the impact of aging on their tennis competitiveness.An Evolutionary History of Tennis Racquets The largest legal racquets, which are known as super-oversize frames, have proven extremely rare in professional competition, with only Monica Seles being a top 10 or higher ranked player who used one (a 125 square inch Yonex) during her career at any time. Andre Agassi achieved considerable success with an oversize racquet, a fact that was often noted due to his rivalry with Pete Sampras, a player who used a much smaller midsize frame. Oversize racquets are generally considered to offer more power but less control, a trend that exists from the smallest racquet size (\\"standard\\") to the largest legal size, which is 135 square inches.  Rarity and Mind Share  There were twelve Fortissimo racquets produced and only two are reportedly still extant, both of which are possessed by Siegfried Kuebler, the designer notable for creating widebody racquets.Siegfried Kuebler - Racquet Collector and Engineer (via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine -- July 18th 2009 snapshot) Those led to the very popular and extremely influential Wilson Profile racquet of 1987.Evolution of the Wilson Tennis Racquet Kuebler's first widebody racquet emerged in 1984. As few were produced and the two that were submitted to the German patent authority disappeared for many years, little is known in the tennis world about the Fortissimo.Siegfried Kuebler - Racquet Collector and Engineer (via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine -- July 18th 2009 snapshot) Howard Head and the company formerly known as Prince Sporting Goods (not Prince Sports) received the mind share and market success for oversize racquets in their early years. The article that appeared on the sporting goods company Tennis Warehouse's website in 2005, in which Kuebler provides the historical details regarding the Fortissimo, is now only available via one of the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine snapshots.
