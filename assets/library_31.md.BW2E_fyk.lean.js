Originally recruited from Fish Creek in South Gippsland, he is the son Maurie Dunstan and brother of Graeme Dunstan, both former Collingwood players. He was a tallish ruck-rover with great ability to win the ball and great skill at kicking straight in the direction of goal.Main, Jim and Holmesby, Russell (editors); The Encyclopedia of League Footballers (1st edition); p. 107. His early years with Footscray were nonetheless patchy, and he lost his place in the senior side after a slump in 1974 and again in 1976 ‚Äì though he returned to play well in the last round draw with Carlton and in his only final against Geelong a week later. Paradoxically, it was whilst Footscray were declining from the middle bracket to perennial contenders for the wooden spoon with St Kilda and Melbourne that Dunstan rose to the heights not only of Footscray's top running players, but even to representing Victoria. On 1 July 1978 Dunstan and Kelvin Templeton kicked against St Kilda a record VFL/AFL total for two players in one team of 22 goals 12 behinds (144 points),FOOTSCRAY-WESTERN BULLDOGS: Seven Goals or more narrowly beating the total of Doug Strang and Jack Titus for Richmond against North Melbourne on 9 May 1931.For some data on Strang's feat, see Lovett, Michael (editor); AFL Record: Guide to Season 2005; p. 572 . Of this Dunstan kicked seven goals, three behinds but had over thirty kicks overall, many of which led to Templeton's record total of twenty-four scoring shots, which contributed to Footscray breaking Carlton's 1969 record VFL score. During the last quarter it was said that Dunstan, who never otherwise kicked five in a match, aimed to reach double figures. As a result of this and other performances, Dunstan represented Victoria several times in the last three years of the late 1970s. As Footscray struggled further owing to the club's limited financial resources ‚Äì going from seven wins in 1978 and 1979 to only five in 1980, two in 1981 and three in 1982 ‚Äì Dunstan won three best and fairest awards in 1979, 1981 and 1982 but Footscray's finances and a youth policy caused them to allow Dunstan to cross to North Melbourne for the 1983 season. He did not play a senior match in 1983 owing to injury and his debut for North Melbourne proved to be embarrassing, with the Kangaroos going down by 137 points to Carlton. He played the first three games in the seniors but it was clear his best days were beyond him and afterward he played only three more senior matches. At the end of 1984 Ian Dunstan retired from the VFL and played briefly with Werribee in the Victorian Football Association. He later joined struggling Association club Sunshine where he had the unfortunate fate to be coach of the senior club when it was expelled from the competition mid- season in 1989.

Plot Raised separately in three villages in La Huasteca (a region in the northeastern Mexico), Lorenzo, from Tamaulipas, is an atheistic bronco; Juan de Dios, from San Luis Potos√≠, is a parish priest; while V√≠ctor, from Veracruz, is a captain in the army. Their great physical resemblance is a source of conflict. Juan de Dios tries to solve the problems with his two brothers. Mexican superstar Pedro Infante played in three separate roles as each of these three individual triplets.Chavez, Denise, \\"Loving Pedro Infante\\", Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York, (2001), p. 5. This author states: \\"Some people call [Pedro Infante] the Bing Crosby of Mexico, but he's more, much more than that. He was bigger than Bing Crosby or even Elvis Presley.\\" In the movie, the villain \\"El Coyote\\", whose identity was unknown, was killing and robbing the people in the village Lorenzo lives in. His brother V√≠ctor was transferred to the village in order to catch \\"El Coyote.\\" V√≠ctor also had a romantic interest in a village girl, Marito√±a (Blanca Estela Pavon), who flirts with him at a party while Veracruz song , \\"La Tuza\\" plays. But firmly rejects all his advances after the party. Mar√≠a Eugenia Llamas, who was only four at the time, made her screen debut in this movie as \\"La Tucita\\", a stage name she has used ever since.La Universidad Aut√≥noma de Nuevo Le√≥n She played the daughter of the saloon owning and atheist triplet, Lorenzo. In Tucita's first appearance in the movie, she has a snake and a tarantula as pets, both of which she handles with love. She also pushes around her otherwise hardened father shamelessly. For instance, she shoots at him with a pistol and misses. Then, she starts crying. Her father asks her if she is crying because she got scared. She responds tearfully that no, she is crying because she didn't kill him ‚Äì which doesn't make him mad. In another scene, when she is in bed, she keeps pestering her father for one thing after another, to which he always complies, if visibly annoyed. Finally, she calls to him in the next room that she is thirsty and demands a glass of water. When he grudgingly brings it, she waters her plant with it instead of drinking it ‚Äì which also makes him more frustrated, but not angry with her. It is her father's stoic acceptance (while sometimes visibly annoyed) of everything Tucita does to him that shows the movie audience that he has a soft spot and is not as thoroughly corrupt as he is otherwise portrayed in the first part of the movie. Nevertheless, Juan de Dios takes an interest in the physical and spiritual welfare of his niece, Tucita. He sometimes puts on a false mustache to disguise himself in the movie as his otherwise identical brother to look in on her, which works in fooling her. She just can't figure out why her \\"father\\" is acting so differently. Lorenzo is finally formally accused of being El Coyote. However, V√≠ctor is the one who gets arrested and held in the village jail, because, disguised as his brother, he is mistaken for Lorenzo. A mob tries to get to him in his cell to hang him. Lorenzo and Juan de Dios overcome the real Coyote (Alejandro Ciangherotti), while he is trying to kill them, and get him to confess in writing that he is El Coyote. They place Tucita's pet tarantula on his chest, which scares the confession out of him. Tucita wags her finger at him and righteously tells him off. \\"Tan grandote y tan lloron (So big and such a baby.) That confession, when presented to the authorities absolves Tucita's father and saves V√≠ctor from the clutches of both the mob and the law. After all that, her father turns over a new leaf and takes Tucita to church for the first time. They kneel before the altar and he lovingly shows her how to make the sign of the cross. As the movie ends, V√≠ctor wins over the Marito√±a while Juan de Dios and Lorenzo look on with great joy that all has turned out so well as their brother rides off with his lady love.

Another advantage of an MSC is that it may make terrorist threat mitigation easier by forcing all incoming packages to come through one point of entry, where systems are in place to screen and quarantine any suspicious packages.

He played college baseball for the University of Miami. Career Armstrong originally was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the ninth round of the 1972 draft, but did not sign. He was then drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the first round (24th overall) of the 1974 amateur draft. While still in the minors, Armstrong was traded to the San Diego Padres in 1979. He made appearances in the majors with the Padres in 1980 and 1981, but mainly played in the minor leagues. Prior to the start of the 1982 season, Armstrong was purchased by the Kansas City Royals. There, Armstrong pitched regularly, with over 100 innings in his two years with the team and had an earned run average under 4.00. Armstrong played in the pine tar game between the Royals and the Yankees on July 24, 1983, earning the victory; a victory it took him almost a month to pick up. \\"It was wild to go back to New York and play these four outs in a totally empty stadium,\\" Armstrong said. \\"I'm dressed in the uniform, and nobody's there.\\" He went 10-7 that season in 58 appearances, notching career highs in wins and games. The 6-foot-3 right-hander was traded to the Yankees after the 1983 season in a deal that brought Steve Balboni to the Royals. While Balboni went on to slug over 100 home runs and contributed to the Royals 1985 World Series triumph, Armstrong reported to spring training in 1984 with a sore arm, limiting him to two Grapefruit League appearances. As a result, Yankees owner George Steinbrenner filed a grievance with Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn. Despite efforts to get another pitcher other than him from the Royals, Armstrong remained with the Yankees, though he spent most of his time with their AAA Columbus farm club from 1984 to 1986. Armstrong finished his Major League career with the Cleveland Indians in 1987. Following his playing career, Armstrong remained involved in baseball. He moved to South Boston, Virginia, where he helped found an adult baseball league and ran a local sporting goods store for five years. Then he worked in the construction business and as a painter until he turned 45, when his major league pension kicked in. He moved to Oconee County, Georgia, close to where his second wife Monica was from. A severe car accident left him with a rod in his right leg, but as of 2006, he was still pitching in a wooden bat league.

The 15min film in Singlish, English and Mandarin was produced, written and directed by Jacen Tan, who also starred in the film. The film talks about the lack of soccer fields in soccer crazy Singapore and difficulties of finding suitable fields in land scarce Singapore. It also laments Singaporeans' lack of support for their national soccer and the futility of Singapore's 2010 World Cup goal.

The school accommodates pupils in Reception at the age of 4, before leaving for senior schools at the age of 11. Facilities The school buildings consist of the main site accommodating pupils from Year 2 through to Year 6, and a separate \\"Pre-Prep\\" building, a few minutes' walk from the main site, accommodating pupils in Reception and Year 1\\\\. The facilities at the main site include a 160-seat theatre, a science block and garden, art and music studios, an ICT suite, and library. Interactive classroom whiteboards are provided throughout most of the school. An indoor swimming pool and sports hall are on site; use is also made of rugby and football pitches at St.James' Primary School, and cricket pitches and athletics facilities at Bushy Park. School structure In 2017 the school announced it was to phase out the sitting of the Common Entrance examination at age 13 (Year 8) and the two academic years leading up to them. All boys would select their future schools in Year 6 and, if required, sit 11+ entrance exams for them, and then leave at the age of 11. This change was made in order to follow the trend of senior schools preferring to admit the majority of their pupils at that age. The first 11+ cohort left in the summer of 2019, and the last 13+ cohort in the summer of 2020. Some pupils may go on to the leading London day schools, including St. Paul's School, Hampton School and King's College School. Others go to a wide range of single-sex and coeducational day schools including Kingston Grammar School, as well as state grammar schools including Tiffin. Link with Chitsime School (Malawi) The Mall School has had a partnership with Chitsime School in Malawi since 2009. It is the focus of many fundraising activities, and the boys are motivated to help the school in as many ways as practicable. In particular, in recent years pupils and staff at the Mall have raised thousands of pounds to provide brand new classrooms for Chitsime School.

History  Jermyn was founded in 1902; relatively recently by rural Texas standards. It was also among the last new settlements in Jack County. Named for the son of Scranton, Pennsylvania coal magnate Joseph Jermyn, the community was established as headquarters for local mining. The Gulf, Texas and Western Railroad reached Jermyn in 1909, and by the 1920s the town possessed a school, a church, a bank, several businesses and an estimated population of 213. As the use of coal subsided in favor of oil, Jermyn developed into an agricultural center for local ranchers and continued to thrive into the 1960s. The population high-water mark was reached in 1968, when Jermyn was reportedly home to 1,066 residents. In the 1970s, however, the community began a steep decline and by 1990 the population had fallen to 75, a number it maintained through to the 2000 Census.*  References  Category:Unincorporated communities in Jack County, Texas Category:Unincorporated communities in Texas Category:Ghost towns in North Texas ","title":"Jermyn, Texas"},{"id":"12710352","text":"Potamonautes platycentron is a species of freshwater crab in the family Potamonautidae, which is endemic to Lake Chala in Kenya and Tanzania.

It includes a number of troglobitic species, and the marbled crayfish (marmorkrebs), which is parthenogenetic. Originally described as a subgenus for four species, it now contains 161 species in 16 subgenera. Biogeography The well-known and widespread Procambarus clarkii strain of Procambarus alleni The majority of the diversity is found in the southeastern United States, but the genus extends as far south as Guatemala and Honduras, and on the Caribbean island of Cuba. After United States, the highest diversity is in Mexico with about 45 species. Only two are native to Guatemala (P. pilosimanus and P. williamsoni), one to Belize (P. pilosimanus), one to Honduras (P. williamsoni) and three to Cuba (P. atkinsoni, P. cubensis and P. niveus). Subgenus Ortmannicus is the most widespread, with the range of Procambarus acutus extending as far north as the Great Lakes and New England, as well as south into northeastern Mexico; the subgenus Girardella also extends from the Great Lakes to Mexico, but is distributed further west than Ortmannicus. Scapulicambarus and Pennides are widespread in the southeastern United States, where Remoticambarus also lives, further west (Texas and Louisiana) than Leconticambarus which is centered on Florida and neighboring states. The subgenus Austrocambarus has the most southerly distribution, being found in Cuba and parts of Central America from Mexico to Belize, Guatemala and Honduras. The other subgenera are more restricted in their distributions, including three endemic to central Mexico, and six endemic to small areas in the United States. A few species of Procambarus have been introduced to regions outside their native range, both in North America and other continents. They are frequently categorized as invasive species, representing a threat to natives, including rarer crayfish species. Description Larva Procambarus can be distinguished from other genera of crayfish by the form of the first pleopod in males, which typically has three or more processes at the tip, compared to two or fewer in Orconectes and Cambarus. Ecology Procambarus vazquezae is found only in Laguna Catemaco in Mexico Most Procambarus species live in various above-ground waters such as rivers, streams, lakes, ponds and swamps, but several are troglobitic, living in caves, particularly in karstic areas. In the United States, these include both species in subgenus Lonnbergius (P. acherontis and P. morrisi) and the single species in the subgenus Remoticambarus, P. pecki. Other cave-dwellers in the United States with various levels of troglomorphic adaptions are P. attiguus, P. erythrops, P. franzi, P. leitheuseri, P. lucifugus, P. milleri and P. orcinus, but these are all members of subgenera that also include species from above-ground waters. In Cuba, P. niveus is a cave-dweller. In Mexico, many species have been recorded in caves, but most of these have also been recorded from above-ground waters; only P. cavernicola, P. oaxacae, P. rodriguezi and P. xilitlae are strict cave-dwellers and troglomorphic. Taxonomy The marbled crayfish (marmorkrebs) is parthenogenetic and its taxonomy is disputed Procambarus was originally described by Arnold Edward Ortmann in 1905 as a subgenus of a wider genus Cambarus, and originally contained only four species (P. williamsoni, P. diguieti, P. mexicanus and P. cubensis).

Hugh Smith was the son of Albert John Smith, a butler, and Anne Smith of Sowerby, West Yorkshire. He was educated at Rishworth School, West Yorkshire, and, after a time working as a railway booking clerk, he went to Leeds University where he was awarded 1st Class BA in English in 1924 and a PhD in 1926. His PhD thesis was on the place-names of the North Riding and the study of place-names remained of continuing interest to him, resulting in several publications. He was Vaughan Fellow at Leeds University from 1924 to 1926, and was then lecturer in English at Saltley College, Birmingham from 1926 to 1928. In 1928 he went to Sweden and was English lecturer at Uppsala University, returning to England in 1930 to University College London (UCL) as a lecturer and reader. In 1937 he was awarded a DLit degree at London University. During World War II, he enlisted in the RAF as an intelligence officer and in 1941 joined the Scientific Intelligence Unit of the Air Ministry under R V Jones, ending with the rank of Wing Commander. He was awarded the OBE for his war-time work in 1947. In 1949 he succeeded Raymond Wilson Chambers as Quain Professor of English at University College London. One of his successors was his former student Randolph Quirk. He was director of Scandinavian studies at UCL from 1946 to 1963. In 1951 he took over the Survey of English Place‚ÄëNames, on which work had virtually ceased during the war. He produced a large number of publications and was also joint editor of Methuen‚Äôs series of Old English Library and of the Early English Texts Society's Facsimile of The Parker Chronicle and Laws 1941. His interests beyond literature included cricket, horology and mechanical engineering. He built a printing press to demonstrate bibliographical problems, but it was destroyed in the bombing of UCL during the war. He was described in his obituary in the Times as \\"a most lovable character who appeared to be of more than human stature. He could be maddening alike in matters of scholarship and in personal relations, though one's irritation never lasted long\\". Randolph Quirk (as RQ) in a follow-up letter referred particularly to his \\"hospitality and loyalty\\". He married in 1928 Helen Penelope Tomlinson the daughter of Charles Herbert Tomlinson, grocer of Solihull, and Lucy Florence Tomlinson (n√©e Wilson). They had two children.

Some Rollinia species produce edible fruits, such as biriba (Rollinia deliciosa). The flavor of the fruit is similar to that of a lemon meringue pie. Ripe fruit is very soft and easily bruised, and cannot be stored for long periods of time. It is usually eaten fresh, but it is also occasionally used in Brazil to make wine. Biriba trees are small to medium in size, and require humid, tropical growing conditions. The fruit is round, ripening from green to yellow, and the skin is covered with small protuberances that bruise to black when the fruit is handled. Not widely cultivated, they have gained a small degree of popularity as dooryard and container trees elsewhere in the world. Rollinia sylvatica and Rollinia emarginata - the latter referred to as aratiku - also produce edible fruit, but are comparatively little-known and only very rarely cultivated. A common pest of Rollinia is the giant silk moth (Arsenura armida), which roosts in masses on the trunks of the trees. Selected species *Rollinia amazonica R. E. Fr *Rollinia andicola P.

Background The metropolitan district was one of the new authorities created by the Local Government Act 1972, which completely reorganised local administration in England and Wales. The new district, one of seven in the West Midlands, had an identical area to the existing County Borough of Wolverhampton. The first council was elected as a \\"shadow authority\\", with the reorganisation coming into effect in the following year on 1 April 1974. Subsequent to the election the shadow council successfully petitioned for a royal charter granting borough status, becoming Wolverhampton Metropolitan Borough Council. Elections At this first election all 60 councillors were elected, there being three councillors in each of the 20 wards. In an anomaly of the usual procedure for local elections, the candidate in first place was elected for 5 years, the candidate in second place for 3 years and the candidate in third place for 2 years. This was to allow for the \\"shadow\\" year of 1974 when the Metropolitan Borough Council was operating in shadow of the County Borough. From 1975 elections were by thirds with one councillor retiring in each ward. Following the election the Labour Party had overall control of the council with 40 councillors to the Conservatives 20. Following the final county borough election held in 1972 the two parties had held 40 seats each on the 80 member council.

The tower, with only few small windows, was the perfect environment for a major conflagration. There were no floors separating one level from another, only steel library stacks surrounded by catwalks. The tower was like an oven and the fire spread quickly. Extinguishing it was extremely difficult, with only one entrance and stairwell from the bottom and limited window access. Fire Chief Alfred Eckert dispatched masked firefighters to the highest floor that could be safely reached. The firefighters spread canvas tarpaulins over as many shelves of books as they could, while hook and ladder trucks sprayed water through the highest openings in the tower, cascading down to the fire below. The fire was declared under control at about 7:00 PM, nine hours after it was discovered. Menahem Schmelzer, the librarian at the time, joined Gerson Cohen, the future chancellor of the JTS, and the fire chief, for the initial foray into the damp, charred stacks. The fire had been confined primarily to the upper stacks, which housed mostly second and third copies of books, although some important recent acquisitions had also been kept there. But the water had caused enormous damage and the growth of mold threatened to do more. After rejecting several methods for drying the water-soaked books, the suggestion was brought to Rabbi David Kogen, then-vice chancellor of the Seminary, to place paper towels between the pages of every book to absorb the moisture. Volunteers of all ages were recruited from around the neighborhood and Jewish day school students were brought in to help. The paper toweling was supplied by local retailers and manufacturers. Some 70,000 volumes were destroyed in the fire and many more were damaged.LOST MEMORY - LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES DESTROYED IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY ( ) The library's rare books and manuscripts, which were stored elsewhere, were spared. The library's book collection was rebuilt with the help of donations from private and institutional libraries. The books were moved to a prefabricated building in the JTS courtyard that remained until a new library building was completed in 1984. The library now exceeds 380,000 volumes. With the assistance of the Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation, 35,000 books that were saved from the fire and placed in high-density storage are being restored and catalogued.

Adapted from Cesare Pavese's novel Tra donne sole (1949), the film is about a young woman who returns to her native Turin to set up a new fashion salon and becomes involved with a troubled woman and her three wealthy friends. The film was shot on location in Turin, Piemonte, Italy. Le amiche received the Venice Film Festival's Silver Lion award in 1955, and the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists Silver Ribbon Award for Best Director (Michelangelo Antonioni) and Best Supporting Actress (Valentina Cortese). Plot Returning to her native Turin for the opening of a branch of a Rome fashion salon, the elegant Clelia (Eleonora Rossi Drago) discovers a young woman named Rosetta Savoni (Madeleine Fischer) near death in the next room of her hotel. Rosetta took an overdose of sleeping pills trying to commit suicide. Clelia, who is alone in her hometown, befriends Rosetta and her three wealthy friends. Momina De Stefani (Yvonne Furneaux) is separated from her husband and easily replaces lovers. Nene (Valentina Cortese) is a talented artist becoming successful in her career; she lives with a frustrated painter named Lorenzo (Gabriele Ferzetti) who envies his wife's success. Mariella (Anna Maria Pancani) is futile. Clelia is attracted by Carlo (Ettore Manni), the assistant of the salon's architect, Cesare Pedoni (Franco Fabrizi), but he belongs to the working class living in a different social reality. When Momina and Clelia discover that Rosetta tried to commit suicide because she fell in love with Lorenzo, the cynical Momina encourages Rosetta to stay with him, although he and Nene were supposed to marry soon. This advice leads to tragedy.

Its development began when Izhevsk Machine-Building Plant (IZHMASH), now known as Kalashnikov Concern started working on a new silent, flame-less, compact AK rifle in the early 2000s. When creating the new weapon, the manufacturers have tried to surpass all available competitors, such as the AS Val and SR-3M. The basis for the silent, flame- less shooting complex rifle was designated as the AK-9, where it uses a quick- detachable suppressor. It uses the 9√ó39mm subsonic cartridge. The AK-9 is primarily designed for special units of the Interior Ministry and the Russian Army. It is one of the latest models of the popular Kalashnikov rifle series. It is based on the AK-100 series, which is a modernization series of Kalashnikov assault rifles. A unique feature of the rifle is the use of the special subsonic cartridge 9√ó39mm SP-5, SP-6. According to its characteristics it competes against the 9A-91, AS Val and SR-3M, but has seen limited use compared to these counterparts, which have already seen service in Russian military and police units.  History  In 2006, Russian authorities wanted the Izhmash factory to design a rifle with Kalashnikov properties, but suitable to be used in special operations. Factory manager Vladimir Grodetsky stated that the rifle was for special forces for anti-terrorist operations. Alexei Dragunov, one of the designers of the AK-9, says \\"It shoots virtually without a sound and it can go through a bullet-proof vest\\". The AK-9 is also lighter than earlier Kalashnikov models. From the Vladimir Zlobin interview in February 2013: > We are working on an entire line of various small arms based on the AK-12. > These would be submachine guns and compact assault rifles, automatic > carbines and hand-held machine guns. On the basic AK-12 platform a series of > special-purpose weapons is being developed. For example, the AK-9 was > transferred to this platform. The weapons are going to be tested this > spring. Design The AK-9 is based on the so-called \\"hundred series\\" of Kalashnikov assault rifles, such as the AK-104, but with certain improvements. It is a selective fire compact assault rifle chambered in 9√ó39mm subsonic cartridge. The AK-9 features the same tried and proven gas operated, rotary bolt action and same \\"Kalashnikov-style\\" controls including reciprocating bolt handle, safety/fire selector lever and overall layout with side-folding polymer buttstock. The Polymer furniture is improved with the addition of accessories such as a Picatinny rail on the bottom of the forend and the left side of the receiver is fitted with a Warsaw Pact rail. The barrel can be fitted with a specially designed quick-detachable suppressor (sound moderator), which is especially effective with the 9√ó39mm subsonic cartridge. The magazine is made of black polymer, holds 20 rounds of ammunition and appears to be of proprietary design, not compatible with other (competing) weapons of the same caliber, which are already in service with Russian military and law enforcement. The AK-9 supports wide range of attachments such as a mounted grenade launcher, laser sights, tactical lights and other tactical accessories. The trigger mechanism allows it to fire in semi-automatic fire and fully automatic fire. The firing module is similar to that of the Kalashnikov assault rifle and is located on the right side of the weapon. Like all the Kalashnikov pattern weapons, it is reliable and simple to use.

The regiment was first raised at Aligarh as an irregular cavalry unit in 1857 as the Jat Horse Yeomanry, for the East India Company by Captain John Irvine Murray (later Sir John Murray) then serving with the Gwalior Contingent. It was raised from 250 sepoys and 120 sowars (cavalrymen) recruited from the Jats of the rural areas of Hathras, Mathura, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, and Khurja in UP, and Palwal and Hodal in Haryana, who were offered by Thakur Gobind Singh, a Jat chieftain of Khair in Aligarh, to combat the 1857 uprising, and thus became the first regiment to be manned completely with Jat troops in the British Indian Army. Until 1861, it was paid for by private funds of the British officers and Indian Risaldars. Later the Regimental Centre and Officers' Mess was established at Palwal. It participated in a number of actions in 1857‚Äì58, especially at Meerut, Delhi and Lucknow, but did not qualify for any battle honour. Subedar Pratap Singh was the first Subedar of the HQ Squadron of the regiment in 1857‚Äì61. Murray's Lancers subsequently served in the Bhutan Field Force. The regiment formed part of the cavalry brigade of the Kabul Field Force during the 1878‚Äì79 Afghanistan War. The regiment participated in a difficult cavalry charge over extremely difficult ground and routed the Afghan line at Charasiah, 15 km from Kabul, on 6 October 1879 for which the regiment was awarded the battle honour \\"Charasiah\\" and the theatre honour \\"Afghanistan 1878‚Äì79\\". The regiment was mentioned in despatches by General Sir Frederick Roberts, VC who wrote: The regiment was merged in 1922 with the 15th Lancers (Cureton's Multanis) to form the 20th Lancers which was transferred to India after partition in 1947.Nath (2009), pp 581-583.

Deasy is a member of the Garda S√≠och√°na.

Despite not making an appearance in the 1995 all-Ireland final due to injury, Deasy got an all-Ireland medal as a member of the Dublin panel. Deasy won Dublin Senior Football Championship medals with Ballymun Kickhams in 1982 and 1985. Deasy was born in August 1960 and first played Gaelic football in Sacred Heart BNS in Ballygall and then in St Kevin's Secondary School. His class and school team-mates included Dublin stars Barney Rock, Gerry Hargan, John Kearns and Anto McCaul. These players formed the backbone of Ballymun Kickhams SF team who first won the SF championship under Deasy's captaincy in 1982. Deasy first played for Dublin under Kevin Heffernan in 1982 and played on and off under successive managers up to 1996. Deasy must be unique in that he has played for Dublin in all the centre spots from full-forward, centre-forward, mid-field, centre-half before finding his niche at full back from 1993 to 1996. He gained a regular spot at full-back at almost 33, an age most players retire. Ironically, he replaced the younger Gerry Hargan on Hargan's retirement. During his three and a bit years at the top of Gaelic football, Deasy won four Leinster medals, one All Ireland Medal, received three All Star nominations, winning one. He also won one National Football League medal, also receiving the Man of the Match Award for keeping Tony Boyle, then Ireland's top forward, scoreless in the final and the replay.

It is found in just one spot in Central Otago, New Zealand, which is now a beetle reserve. Description and biology This species was named by Broun in 1904 as Prodontria Lewisii, from \\"three mutilated individuals found by Mr. J. H. Lewis on the sand-hills of the Molyneaux River.\\" Although its species epithet was lewisii, the modernised genitive of Lewis, both lewisii and lewisi are used in the scientific literature; lewisii is slightly more common. This large beetle has pale reddish-brown elytra which are strongly convex and with deep groves passing along their length. Females are longer and wider than males, but males have a longer hind foot and tibia. The beetles live underground. They spend at least one year as larvae, living buried in the sand and feeding on plant roots. Adults emerge on humid nights on spring and summer for a few hours to feed on lichens and plants ‚Äì mostly speedwell (Veronica arvensis), sheep's sorrel (Rumex acetosella), and cushion plant (Raoulia australis) ‚Äì and to mate. Males emerge slightly earlier in the year than females, on average. Habitat and distribution 350x350px The habitat of this beetle is an area of low sand dunes on the Cromwell river terrace, known as the ‚ÄúCromwell shallow sand‚Äù. The dunes are formed by loess originally deposited by the Clutha River. As P. lewisii seems to be adapted to burrowing in these inland dunes, its entire natural range was probably never more than 500 hectares. The species is currently restricted to an 81 hectare nature reserve, between Bannockburn and Cromwell. Regular surveys of the beetle suggest they are only using 12% of the habitat available in the reserve.  Conservation  A male Cromwell chafer beetle on Raoulia australis The river terrace the beetle occupies is also the location of the town of Cromwell. Some of the beetles were found north of the town in 1968, next to a nine-hole golf course, but that population was destroyed when the course was expanded to 18 holes. A block of undeveloped habitat surrounded by streets existed in the town of Cromwell itself by the 1970s; two residents used pitfall traps to catch and relocate the beetles from this block over 1975‚Äì76, before it was levelled for housing. Much of the rest of the beetle's original 500-hectare range was destroyed by the construction of the Clyde Dam in 1979 and the subsequent formation of Lake Dunstan. The remaining surviving population of the Cromwell chafer was a 95 hectare triangular area of undeveloped land immediately south-west of Cromwell. In 1979, an 81 ha area was fenced off to protect the population, and in 1983 it was gazetted as the Cromwell Chafer Beetle Nature Reserve: at the time, the only reserve in the world created solely for an invertebrate. In 1996, after years of being classed as Vulnerable, the Cromwell chafer was declared Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. It currently has the Department of Conservation status Nationally Endangered. The main threats to the Cromwell chafer were formerly habitat destruction, but now are introduced predators. Illustrated by Lesley Alexander The beetle is preyed on by introduced hedgehogs, little owls, and possibly European earwigs. Recently, the species of most concern has been the introduced Australian redback spider, which became established in Central Otago in the 1980s. Redback spiders shelter in rabbit holes in the reserve, and may kill hundreds of chafer beetles a year. The Department of Conservation are controlling rabbits and destroying rabbit burrows in the reserve. There is an annual survey of Cromwell chafer numbers ‚Äì on \\"Cromwell chafer beetle day\\" ‚Äì by DOC and Agresearch, conducted by taking 670 core samples of sand in the reserve and checking them for beetle larvae. Numbers found are usually very low, just a few individuals per survey. The current population of Cromwell chafers is estimated to be approximately 3000 individuals.

Biography Born in Edinburgh, he took an arts degree at the University of Edinburgh and studied composition privately with the Anglo-Canadian composer Healey Willan. From there he developed his career as editor, music critic, and author. Gray first met Philip Heseltine (another writer/critic who also composed music under the name Peter Warlock) at the Cafe Royal in the spring of 1916 and they were soon sharing a studio ‚Äì 2 Anhalt Studios, close to Battersea Park. This led to Gray's first musical venture, the co-sponsoring with Heseltine in 1917 of a concert of works by the then completely unknown composer Bernard van Dieren. Three years later Gray co-founded the early music periodical The Sackbut, also with Heseltine. Gray subsequently worked as music critic for publications including The Daily Telegraph, The Manchester Guardian, and The Morning Post, and occasionally for the Radio Times and The Listener.Foss, Hubert, \\"Cecil Gray, 1895‚Äì1951\\", in The Musical Times Vol. 92, No. 1305 (Nov. 1951), pp. 496‚Äì498 His first published book, A Survey of Contemporary Music, was published in 1924, and was notable for its contrary opinions. Frank Howes, The Times chief music critic, pointed out that the formula \\"so far from the usual view being true, the precise opposite is the case\\" occurs every few pages.\\"Mr Cecil Gray\\", The Times, 19 September 1951, p6 With Heseltine, Gray co-authored the characteristically perverse Carlo Gesualdo, Prince of Venosa: Musician and Murderer in 1926. A full, but equally unorthodox History of Music followed in 1928.\\"Cecil Gray's 'History of Music', The Musical Times, 1 September 1928, Vol.69(1027), pp.833‚Äì833 Gray was also an early advocate of Sibelius, championing his music in the UK from 1923 when it was still all but unknown there. He wrote two books on the composer in 1931 and 1935. His sympathetic portrayal of Heseltine/Warlock in his memoir of 1934 is thought by many to be his best literary work. There were also two collections of essays, Predicaments (1936) and Contingencies (1947), a play about Gilles de Rais and an autobiography, Musical Chairs (1948).Cecil Gray: Musical Chairs Musical works Gray was also a composer,R. Gorer: 'The Music of Cecil Gray', Musical Review, 47 (1947), 188‚Äì96 but preferred to promote the music of his friends Constant Lambert, Peter Warlock and Bernard van Dieren above his own.\\"Bernard van Dieren, Philip Heseltine and Cecil Gray: A Significant Affiliation \\", Davies, Hywel, Music & Letters, 1 January 1988, Vol.69(1), pp.30‚Äì48 Hubert Foss said that not even his most intimate friends knew of his complete worth as a composer.Hubert Foss, \\"Mr Cecil Gray\\", The Times, 26 September 1951, p6 (In his autobiography Musical Chairs, Gray said that he was \\"regarded by musicians as a writer and by writers as a musician\\"). His first work was the Irish opera Deirdre, completed in 1937.Foreman, Lewis. The Quest for Deirdre, BBC Radio 3, 31 October, 1995 It was never performed in its entirety, but Gray did extract from its third act the Symphonic Prelude for Orchestra (1945), which received several performances in England and the United States.Gray, Pauline, introduction to Musical Chairs, 1985 There were two other operas: The Temptation of St Anthony, (after Flaubert) (1937)\\"The Queen of Sheba\\" (from The Temptation of St. Anthony), Alexander Hart, Youtube and The Trojan Women.Frank Howes, \\"Cecil Gray\\" in Grove Music Online, 2001 None of the operas were ever staged, but the BBC did broadcast music from The Trojan Women on 5 April 1944, conducted by Constant Lambert. Radio Times listing Like Heseltine/Warlock, Gray adopted a pseudonym for some compositions to thwart the enemies he'd made as a critic. Syllogism, or Thesis, Antithesis and Synthesis for orchestra and female chorus was composed using the name Marcus Lestrange.British Library archive Gray's friend, the artist Michael Ayrton, remembered other works, including an Overture Roma Nobilis and a setting of Canticle of the Sun, but both appear to be lost. Personal life In 1917 Gray took out a five-year lease on Count House, close to Bosigran Castle in Cornwall (the house is now a climber's club)Wall, Ian. The Count House where he became a neighbour of D. H Lawrence. While there, Gray had a relationship with the American Imagist poet H.D. with whom he had a daughter, Perdita, in 1919.Wade, Francesca. Square Haunting (2020), p 65 In her autobiographical novel Bid Me to Live H.D. portrayed Gray as the character \\"Vane\\". The character \\"Cyril Scott\\" in Aaron's Rod (1922) by Lawrence was also based on Gray. He was married three times, first (in 1927) to Natalia Mamontova, the daughter of Natalia Brasova. Their daughter Pauline was born in 1929. But the marriage did not last and Gray married again in 1936, to the Scottish ballet dancer Marie Nielson. Another daughter, Fabia, was born in 1938. His third marriage, to Margery Livingstone Herbage (previously the wife of the BBC's Julian Herbage) in 1944, ended at her death in 1948. Among his grandchildren, through Perdita, was the author and Beatles biographer Nicholas Schaffner. Gray evidently had difficult relationships with women, something that is partly portrayed by Anthony Powell in his A Dance to the Music of Time sequence of novels ‚Äì in particular the fifth volume Casanova's Chinese Restaurant. The characters of Maclintick and Gossege are said to form a composite portrait of Gray, though Powell also added echoes of Peter Warlock into the mix.Spurling, Hilary: Dancing to the Music of Time, Hamish Hamilton, 2017 A hard drinker with a cocaine habit Gray was a slow talker who warmed up and was not regarded as conventional \\"good company\\". However he maintained close relationships with many writers, poets, painters and musicians. In 1947 he and his wife Margery moved to the island of Ischia, and then to Capri. He became increasingly ill following Margery's death, returning to the UK in 1951 where he died of cirrhosis of the liver in a Worthing nursing home.

Open to the public in summer months, it is owned and operated by Trinity House. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II listed building.  History = Construction  Start Point is one of twenty nine towers designed by James Walker. The lighthouse is in the gothic style, topped by a crenellated parapet. The main tower is built of tarred and white-painted granite ashlar with a cast-iron lantern roofed in copper. The tall circular tower is high with a moulded plinth and pedestal stage and two diminishing stages above that. There are two entrances porches, on the north and south sides. The porch on the south side is blocked and has a 4-centred arch hood mould, whilst the doorway to the north porch has a Tudor arch. Both have raised parapets with Trinity House arms. The inside of the tower includes a cantilevered granite staircase around the inside well of the tower with an iron balustrade completed by a cast-iron newel. The lighthouse originally had the keepers' living accommodation on the ground and first floors but this was removed in 1871 when new keepers' houses were built, either side of the porches to the north and south. In 1882 another cottage was built, detached from the tower, to the east. All three were designed by James Douglass (though the north and south dwellings were rebuilt in the mid-1950s). Other nearby buildings were used by the lighthouse keepers, who originally could only get on or off the lighthouse by boat, such as the well-house and piggery.  Optics  The original main optic consisted of a rotating octagonal array of eight large (first-order) Fresnel lenses, topped by seven tiers of concave mirrors. This was the first time Trinity House had installed a dioptric (i.e. lens-based) optic in one of their lighthouses;Wikisource:1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica/Lighthouse manufactured by Cookson & co. of Newcastle- upon-Tyne, the design was based on the improved dioptric system developed from the work of Augustin Fresnel by Alan Stevenson, engineer to the Northern Lighthouse Board. In 1873, a new lantern was built on top of the tower, designed by James Douglass. In it, a new, more powerful revolving optic was installed, designed by James Timmins Chance: a six-sided symmetrical optic of the first-order, with refracting prisms above and below the central lens elements. At the time its six lens panels (at 60¬∞ to the circle) were 'the widest in azimuth hitherto constructed, except some of those of Flamborough Head'; the increase in power, compared to the old 45¬∞ lenses, was of the order of 3 to 2. Apparatus of the same design were installed the following year in lighthouses at South Stack and Cape Bon. The light was powered by oil until 1959 when it was electrified. At the same time the optic was replaced by a smaller (third-order) catadioptric lens, made up of two groups of three asymmetrical panels, which produced a group-flashing light characteristic. In 2018 this rotating optic was replaced by a two-tier LED lantern; the old lens was put on display in the adjacent visitor centre. In addition to the main light a fixed red subsidiary light is shone from a window in the tower to mark the Skerries Bank. This was commissioned at the same time as the main light (though initially it shone white, not red, and from a higher window). The original light source was a single Argand lamp backed by a 21-inch reflector; but, following the 1873 upgrade, it instead used light diverted by means of prisms from the rear of the main lamp. Work began on the automation of Start Point Lighthouse in August 1992 and was carried out by LEC Marine at a cost of ¬£82,754. It was completed in early 1993. After automation, the south keepers' cottage (which had been damaged in the 1989 the landslip) was demolished. The station is now monitored and controlled from the Trinity House Operations Control Centre at Harwich in Essex via a telemetry link.  Foghorn  The light alone was found to be inadequate in fog, and a bell was installed in 1862; the machinery was housed in a small building which still stands on the cliff face to the south-east of the lighthouse. It sounded 48 times every minute, the mechanism being driven by a weight which fell in a tube running down the sheer cliff. A siren replaced the bell in 1877; (the bell was transferred to the lighthouse on Plymouth Breakwater where it still hangs). The fog siren was housed in a circular building, just to the south of the lighthouse, and sounded (one blast every three minutes) through a roof-mounted horizontal horn which could be turned in the direction of the prevailing wind. The fog signal was upgraded in 1883 by the installation of a two-tone siren; it now sounded thrice every three minutes (high, then low, then high). Around the turn of the century new equipment was installed, including a new pair of 5\\" sirens sounding through a pair of curved vertical copper trumpets. This was in turn replaced by a more powerful 12\\" siren in 1928, again housed in the same building, sounded from a pair of conical horns housed in a cast-iron turret on the roof.Photo showing fog horn building (right) At the same time a pair of Gardner diesel engines were provided to drive the air compressors, replacing an earlier set of engines. In 1989, the erosion of the coast caused the fog signal building to collapse. A lot of the area had to be levelled as a result and retaining walls put in place. An electric signal was instead installed on the gallery of the lighthouse (this is itself scheduled for replacement by a more modern system in 2018). When required the foghorn sounds once every 60 seconds.

Bilkent University. Accessed 9 June 2011. Stanford Shaw and his parents moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1933 because of his father's illness, and they lived there until 1939, first in Hollywood, where Stanford went to kindergarten, and then in Ocean Park, a community on the shore of the Pacific Ocean between Santa Monica and Venice, where his parents operated a photographic shop on the Ocean Park pier. The family returned to St. Paul in 1939, where Stanford went to the Webster Elementary School. After his parents divorced, Stanford went with his mother to Akron, Ohio during World War II, where he went to elementary school. Stanford and his mother remained there until she married Irving Jaffey and moved back to St. Paul. Stanford then attended Mechanic Arts High School in St. Paul, where he graduated in 1947, one out of only five students from a student body of 500 who went to college. Education and early research He went on to Stanford University, where he majored in British history under the direction of Professor Carl Brand, with a minor in Near Eastern history, under the direction of Professor Wayne Vucinich. He received his B.A. at Stanford in 1951 and M.A. in 1952, with a thesis on the foreign policy of the British Labour Party from 1920‚Äì1938, based on research in the Hoover Institution at Stanford. He then studied Middle Eastern history along with Arabic, Turkish and Persian as a graduate student at Princeton University starting in 1952, receiving his M.A. in 1955. Subsequently he went to England to study with Bernard Lewis and Paul Wittek at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London and with Professor H. A. R. Gibb at Oxford University. Following this, he went to Egypt to study with Shafiq Ghorbal and Adolph Grohmann at the University of Cairo and Shaikh Sayyid at the Azhar University, also doing research in the Ottoman archives of Egypt at the Citadel in Cairo for his Princeton Ph.D. dissertation concerning Ottoman rule in Egypt. Before leaving Egypt, he had a personal interview with President Gamal Abd al-Nasser, who arranged for him to take microfilms of Ottoman documents out of the country. Main research In 1956-7 he studied at the University of Istanbul with Professors Omer Lutfi Barkan, Mukrimin Halil Yinanc, Halil Sahillioglu, and Zeki Velidi Togan, also completing research on his dissertation in the Ottoman archives of Istanbul, where he was helped by a number of staff members, including Ziya Esrefoglu, Turgut Isiksal, Rauf Tuncay, and Attila Cetin, and in the Topkapi Palace archives, where he was provided with valuable assistance and support by its director, Hayrullah Ors and studied with Professor Ismail Hakki Uzuncarsili.

Criticism=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey One of Shaw's most prominent works was a two-volume history on the Ottoman Empire, titled History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey. The first volume, subtitled Empire of the Gazis: the Rise and Decline of the Ottoman Empire, 1280‚Äì1808, published in 1976, was met with generally mixed to negative reviews. Many faulted him for producing a work embellished with numerous historical errors and distortions. Colin Imber, a scholar on Ottoman history, noted in his review that both volumes were \\"so full of errors, half- truths, oversimplifications and inexactitudes that a non-specialist will find them positively misleading....When almost every page is a minefield of misinformation, a detailed review is impossible.\\"Imber, Colin. \\"Review of History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey.\\" The English Historical Review 93 (Apr. 1978): pp. 393‚Äì395. Another reviewer, Victor L. M√©nage, Professor of Turkish at the University of London, counted over 70 errors in the work and concluded, \\"One 'prejudice' that has vanished in the process is the respect for accuracy, clarity, and reasoned judgment.\\"M√©nage, Victor L. \\"Review of History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey.\\" Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London 41 (1978): pp. 160‚Äì162. In his extensive review of the first volume, Speros Vryonis, a specialist in Byzantine and Early Ottoman Studies at UCLA, listed a litany of problems he encountered in the work, such as Shaw's assertion that Sultan Mehmed II's forces did not subject Constantinople to a full scale sack and massacre upon its capture and his account of the treatment of the Greeks of Cyprus following the Ottoman conquest in 1571.Vryonis, Speros. Stanford J. Shaw, History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, Volume I: A Critical Analysis. Thessaloniki: Institute for Balkan Studies, 1983. Vryonis also charged Shaw for largely failing to consult the proper primary sources of the period and therefore presenting a distorted picture of the formation of the Armenian and Greek/Eastern Orthodox millets.Vryonis. A Critical Analysis, pp. 88‚Äì112. More troubling allegations were put forward by Vryonis, when he accused the Shaw of wholesale plagiarism, claiming that as much as 90% of the first volume had been lifted from the works of two Turkish historians and a Turkish-language encyclopedia.Lecture delivered by Robert Hewsen. , part of the 2007 Holocaust and Genocide Lecture Series at Sonoma State University (27:24 mark). 17 April 2007. Accessed 17 May 2011. Vryonis presented his findings to the administration at UCLA, but the university declined to carry out any further investigation into the matter. In the second volume of the History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey, which Shaw co-authored with his wife, Ezel Kural Shaw, and which was published in 1977 with the subtitle Reform, Revolution, and Republic: the Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808‚Äì1975, the Shaws denied the Armenian Genocide. Most scholars today believe that the events of 1915 constitute genocide.Why scholars say Armenian Genocide was genocide but Obama won't, Newsweek However, according to Richard G. Hovannisian the Shaws characterize the Armenians as \\"the victimizers rather than the victims, as the privileged rather than the oppressed, and the fabricators of unfounded tales of massacre.\\"Hovannisian, Richard G. \\"The Armenian Genocide and Patterns of Denial\\" in The Armenian Genocide in Perspective, ed. Richard G. Hovannisian. New Brunswick, NJ: Transactions Publishers, 1986, p. 125.

Z√ºrcher of the University of Leiden describes the second volume as \\"a mine of data,\\" though the information not necessarily being accurate. He highlighted the Shaws' treatment of the reigns of Selim III and Abd√ºlhamit II as the book's strongest parts, but observed that the last one hundred years it covers suffers from a \\"Turkish-nationalist bias.\\"Z√ºrcher, Eric J. Turkey: A Modern History, 3rd. Ed. London: I.B. Tauris, 2004, p. 360. The second volume caused a stir among Armenian students attending UCLA and the Armenian community of Los Angeles at large. Matters came to a head when on the night of 3 October 1977, a bomb, placed by unknown assailants, exploded at the doorstep of Shaw's home at 3:50 a.m., although no one was hurt. A phone call placed several hours later by a man claimed that the Iranian Group of 28 was responsible for the bombing. Turkey's permanent ambassador to the UN disputed this, however, and alleged that Armenians were behind the attack. Shaw made light of the situation and attributed the bombing to the fact that he had probably assigned too many F's. But he claimed that Armenian and Greek students had threatened him over the previous two years and canceled the rest of his classes for the remainder of the quarter.Daily Bruin. 4 October 1977, p. 1. With the controversy unabated ten years later, Shaw would claim Armenians were persecuting him not because of his scholarly views but for anti-Semitism, a charge that was refuted by Jewish organizations, including the UCLA chapter of Hillel, on campus, as well as a number of Jewish public figures and scholars.Arkun, Aram. \\"Stanford Jay Shaw, 1930‚Äì2006: An academic who denied the Armenian Genocide.\\" The Armenian Reporter. 23 December 2006.

Turkey and the Holocaust In 1991, Shaw's study on the role of Turkey in providing refuge to the Jews of Europe in the years leading to and during the Holocaust was published.Shaw, Stanford. Turkey and the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in Rescuing Turkish and European Jewry from Nazi Persecution, 1933‚Äì1945. New York: New York University Press, 1993. Shaw claimed that the Republic of Turkey, as a neutral during the greater part of World War II, exerted its diplomatic efforts to the best of its abilities to save Jews of Turkish origins from extermination. The work was particularly receptive among Turkish government circles. It was, however, severely criticized by Bernard Wasserstein in The Times Literary Supplement for factual and methodological errors. Shaw's points have been challenged in a more recent study by Corry Guttstadt, who contests that his work has contributed to \\"an ossified, self-perpetuating myth [of Turkish utilitarianism] which is frequently propagated in international publications,\\"Guttstadt, Corry. Turkey, the Jews, and the Holocaust.

Its members are non-supervisory personnel and include fire-fighters with the Jamaica Fire Brigade, workers at the National Water Commission, non-nursing personnel in the health service, non- teachers in the schools, workers at the National Irrigation Commission and government employees in the 13 Parish Councils.\\"JALGO Working Towards Better Benefits For Workers,\\" Jamaica Gleaner, November 21, 2000. History JALGO was formed in 1940. After a series of labor uprisings, colonial British authorities passed a reform law in December 1938 legalizing trade unionism in Jamaica. The Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (BITU) and the Trade Unions Congress (TUC) both were formed after passage of the trade union law.Black, A New History of Jamaica, 1974; Eaton, Alexander Bustamante and Modern Jamaica, paperback ed., 1995. BITU and TUC quickly elevated the wages of some manual laborers to a point where they were at the same level or even higher than clerical workers in local government. When white-collar workers employed by the city of Kingston began demanding wage increases, the colonial government set up a one-man commission to make recommendations. The white-collar workers consulted with Alexander Bustamante, Noel Nethersole and Frank Hill‚Äîleaders of the nascent Jamaican labor movement‚Äîon what to do. Bustamante and the others recommended the formation of a trade union to empower the workers.\\"A Look At The Early Roots,\\" Jamaica Gleaner, November 21, 2000. On November 16, 1940, Kingston city workers formed the Municipal Officers Association. Although Bustamante and others had counseled an industrial union, membership in the new organization was limited to white-collar workers. Government workers throughout Jamaica flocked to the new union, and parish branches sprung up nationwide. The first general meeting of the union was held in June 1941 and a constitution adopted. The Municipal Officers Association quickly won improved salaries and benefits. Government workers decided that a national organization was needed to coordinate the activities of the parish branches, and the Jamaica Association of Local Government Officers (JALGO) was formed a short while later. In 1961, E. Lloyd Taylor was elected General Secretary of JALGO. Taylor went into government service in 1945 and immediately joined JALGO. He was elected president of the Kingston parish branch in 1955. Taylor fervently believed in industrial unionism, and quickly joined with other militant elements in the branch to push for expansions in the definition of membership. The JALGO executive council opposed the move, and threatened to dissolve the Kingston branch. But Taylor and his followers prevailed, and in 1961 they succeeded in amending the union constitution to allow weekly paid workers to become members. Taylor was elected General Secretary, but it was not until 1966 more far-reaching changes were made. But by 1970, JALGO membership was open to every government worker regardless of their category or status. Along with the changes in membership came a more liberal and activist outlook for JALGO. In the 1970s, JALGO focused on building its membership, securing expanded worker rights, and improving benefits. Taylor was an active proponent of trade union unity, and he pushed JALGO to play a lead role in forming the Joint Trade Unions Research Development Centre (JTURDC) in 1980. Talks between Jamaica and the government of Norway had led to the establishment of JTURDC, which served four major unions: BITU, the National Workers' Union (NWU), the TUC, and JALGO. The JTURDC later evolved into the Jamaica Confederation of Trade Unions (JCTU).Allen, \\"Dwight Nelson: He Is Not Himself If He Does Not Serve,\\" Jamaica Observer, June 13, 2004. But the union suffered significant setbacks in the 1980s. JALGO had nearly 15,000 members in 1980. The Edward Seaga administration restructured local government services between 1984 and 1986, with many local government functions assumed by the national government. More than 8,000 JALGO members at the local level lost their jobs, including a large number of elected leaders. In the midst of these membership losses, JALGO and other unions on the island were forced to call a general strike. As inflation soared to 30 percent, the government offered JALGO a 12 to 15 percent wage increase. JALGO, BITU and other unions representing 250,000 members (roughly 10 percent of the island's population) engaged in a four-day general strike to win higher wages. The strike ended in a stalemate, but significantly weakened the Seaga administration.\\"Jamaica Hit By General Strike,\\" Associated Press, June 25, 1985. Then in 1987 the national government proposed nationalizing fire-fighting departments nationwide. The \\"Fire Brigade Act\\" passed in October 1988, stripping fire-fighters and fire officers of the right to joint a union. Many members of the Fire Brigade refused to end their JALGO memberships, and in 1990 the act was amended to restore the right to join the union.\\"Jamaica: Government to Reconsider Controversial Law,\\" Inter Press Service, September 17, 1987. After 34 years leading the union, Taylor stepped down as General Secretary of JALGO in 1995. Helene Davis-Whyte was elected his successor. Recent activities JALGO faced another threat to its existence in 2000. The Junior Doctors Association, which represented residents and interns in the Jamaican health system, had threatened to strike. The government obtained an injunction against the association. The association appealed, arguing that it was not a trade union as provided for under the law and subsequently could not be sued. In Junior Doctors Association and Attorney General for Jamaica, (Suit No. E127/2000, decided July 12, 2000), the Supreme Court of Civil Appeal ruled that the injunction was indeed void for the reasons set forth by the association. In retaliation, Prime Minister P. J. Patterson announced the government would no longer negotiate with \\"non-legal entities.\\" Thousands of public workers represented by organizations other than formal trade unions lost their representation. JALGO was able to avoid the loss of representation because its members were either represented by registered trade unions at the local level, or because federal law specifically recognized JALGO as the collective bargaining agent.Virtue, \\"'Unions' Side-Step Government Ruling,\\" Jamaica Gleaner, August 13, 2000. JALGO has also struggled recently to maintain its members' wage and benefit gains. The government imposed a wage freeze on public sector unions in February 2004 as part of its effort to rein in inflation. But after prices surged 13 percent in last 10 months of 2004, BITU announced it was pulling out of the \\"Memorandum of Understanding\\" (MoU, the government's collective bargaining agreement with public-sector unions). JALGO General-Secretary Davis-Whyte refused to withdraw from the MoU, helping save the agreement and leading to improved relations with the government.Davidson and Bellanfante, \\"Gov't Moves to Save MOU,\\" Jamaica Observer, May 4, 2005. In 2006, the Patterson administration announced it was ending a wage freeze implemented in the MoU. Davis-Whyte was named to a trade union body (which included representatives from the Jamaica Teachers' Association and Jamaica Civil Service Association) to negotiate the next MoU.Rose and Hepburn, \\"No Wage Freeze - Unions Ready for New MoU Talks,\\" Jamaica Gleaner, January 18, 2006. But six months later, JALGO and two other public employee unions were forced to strike the National Water Commission to increase salaries (which averaged 28 percent below market).Brown and Hines, \\"Water Strike Hits Hard,\\" Jamaica Observer, June 22, 2006. Structure JALGO is governed by its members. The members are organized into parish branches. Members at the parish branch level elect officers of the parish branch as well as delegates, both of which then represent the parish branch on the JALGO national executive council. Members in each governmental agency and occupation also elect delegates to the executive council. The executive council is JALGO's policy-making body. It debates and votes on policy, approves the budget, and engages in other activities which administer the union. A General Meeting is held every two years. Members directly elect the officers of the union. There are six vice- presidents who represent the six geographical regions of the nation, and two officers: the General Secretary and the President. The General Secretary is the union's highest elected office, while the president serves as an aide to the General Secretary. The vice presidents coordinate the activities of the parish branches in their jurisdictions, while the General Secretary and President oversee the day-to-day operations of the union. As of 2007, Stanley Thomas is the president and Helene Davis-Whyte is the General Secretary. JALGO primarily engages in collective bargaining and represents the interests of its members in the workplace (largely through filing grievances and participating in workplace decision-making structures). The union also provides a number of member benefits, including emergency loans to members and competitive educational scholarships. The union's headquarters are in Kingston. It is a member of the Jamaica Confederation of Trade Unions and Public Services International. NotesReferences *\\"A Look At The Early Roots.\\" Jamaica Gleaner.

The college is for students aged 11‚Äì16 and post-16 students go on to local sixth form colleges such as Barton Peveril and Eastleigh College, which are located in the neighbouring town of Eastleigh. It currently has over 1300 students, 95 teaching staff and 80 support staff. History The original village school in Fair Oak at Fair Oak Court catered for pupils aged 5 to 14. In 1935 a new school was built on the Infants School site, and pupils continued at this school until 1958 when it was decided that the 248 pupils should attend a newly created secondary school in Eastleigh. They were joined by Bishopstoke pupils as other Eastleigh secondary schools were overcrowded. As the school was now sited outside its catchment area, all pupils had to travel to and from by bus. Originally, the new school was known as the Eastleigh Secondary School, but within a year the new Headmaster, Robert Blachford, chose the distinctive name of Wyvern with the motto \\"Advance\\". This heraldic dragon has been connected with Wessex since Tudor times and formed the crest of Sir Francis Drake; it also featured on the badge of Blachford's Wessex regiment. However, accommodation became a problem at the Wyvern County Secondary School, and in 1966 the Wyvern arose again at Fair Oak, in the centre of the catchment area which also included the villages of Colden Common, Durley, Horton Heath and Upham. The number on roll had risen to 750. The new school buildings, designed for 450 pupils, were not large enough and the old school in Eastleigh became known as \\"the Annexe\\", with a whole year group being bused to and fro each day. The school leaving age was increased to 16, new courses were introduced and Fair Oak became an increasingly popular residential area. By 1976 the school roll was 1200 and the teaching staff had increased from 10 to 60. However, it was in 1978 before there was sufficient accommodation and \\"the Annexe\\" was no longer needed. Subsequently, throughout the 80's and 90's, all departments were gradually enlarged and suited to facilitate the delivery of the changing curricula. In 1985, the then headmaster George Davies achieved community status for the school. Information Technology then developed rapidly and started to form an integral part of every student's learning experiences and in September 2000, the school was awarded specialist school status and became Wyvern Technology College. The college converted to an academy in June 2012, changing its name to Wyvern College at the same time. Wyvern College has been credited in the past with several national achievements in music, drama and art such the Music for Youth semi-final place earned by the Wyvern Soul Band in July 2015.

Mokvi Cathedral consists of five naves, built in the third quarter of the 10th century, during the reign of king Leon III of Abkhazia. According to a non-extant inscription (found by Patriarch Dositheos II of Jerusalem who visited Mokvi in 1659) the church was painted during the reign of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos and David IV of Georgia.–ê–∫—Ç—ã —Å–æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –ö–∞–≤–∫–∞–∑—Å–∫–æ—é –ê—Ä—Ö–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ—é –ö–æ–º–∏—Å—Å–∏–µ—é (Acts of Caucasian Archeographic Commission), v. 5, pp. 1056-1057, cited by In the Catholicate of Abkhazia Mokvi was the seat of a Bishop at least until the 17th century. Historical -architectural description Over the centuries, Mokvi was a significant centre of the Georgian culture, where manuscripts were copied and old codices were renovated. Up to now preserved are manuscripts from the Mokvi church library, bearing names of the persons active in Mokvi. Among Mokvi antiquities of special significance and artistic value is the famous Mokvi Four Gospels, commissioned by Daniel Mokveli (Bishop of Mokvi) in 1300. Mokvi church, the centre of such a vast cultural activity, was also rich in epigraphic monuments. However, at present, only an inscription on Mokvi bell-tower is preserved. Mokvi Episcopacy was established in the 10th c., but Mokvi, as one of the most significant centre of the Georgian culture, experienced special efflorescence from the 13th c. onwards. Georgian literary sources have preserved names of the bishops of Mokvi, whose contribution to the Georgian culture is hard to undervalue, such as Grigol Mokveli, Daniel Mokveli, Abraam Mokveli, Eptvime Sakvarelidze, Pilipe Chkhetidze and others. Mokvi church has a long history. It was substantially renovated and painted in the reign of David IV the Builder (1089-1125); however, no traces of these murals are left at present in the church. In the 1980s, fragments of the presumably 15th c. murals and numerous other Georgian inscriptions were discovered here. It is a cross-in-square domed church with chapels alongside the naves. East side has three protruded apses. The middle apse of alter is horseshoe shaped from the inside, and has five facets in the outside. The dome is erased on four pillars, which are in the centre of the buildings. The sail is the way to move from the square to dome neck. The dome‚Äôs twelve-facet neck is low. The building is adorned with hewn stone. The facades are simple, without any ornaments. The smooth surfaces are divided into two tiers, by the row of the apertures.

After obtaining his doctorate degree in engineering from the Karlsruhe Technische Hochschule in Germany, Kouwenhoven began his career as the dean at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Kouwenhoven focused his research mainly on improving and saving lives of patients through the application of electricity. With the help and cooperation of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine's Department of Surgery and an Edison Electric Institution grant, Kouwenhoven was able to develop a closed-chest defibrillator. For his contributions to the field of medical science, he became the first ever recipient of an honorary degree conferred by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Two years before his death, Kouwenhoven was also awarded the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research.  Biography = Early life and education  William Bennet Kouwenhoven was born in Brooklyn, NY, on January 13, 1886. Kouwenhoven attended the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn beginning in 1903. As a college freshman, Kouwenhoven was intrigued by the relationship between electricity and medicine, which later became the topics for his English thesis. Three years later, he graduated with a BA in electrical engineering. Then in 1907, he earned his MS in mechanical engineering and began teaching physics and electrical engineering at the institute. In 1910, Kouwenhoven married Abigail Baxter Remsen and traveled to Germany to study at the Karlsruhe Technische Hochschule. Kowenhoven had only one child, whom he named William G. Kouwenhoven. After obtaining his doctorate in engineering in 1913, Kouwenhoven moved back to the United States. He then taught engineering at Washington University in St. Louis for a year.  Career at Johns Hopkins  In 1914, William Kouwenhoven was hired as a professor at Johns Hopkins University's School of Engineering. His research interests consisted of the effects of electricity on the human body and cardiac arrest. By 1919, he worked as an associate professor at Johns Hopkins and was later promoted to full professor in 1930. Kouwenhoven was able to hold that position for 24 years during his tenure at Johns Hopkins. Due to the success of his research, Kouwenhoven was promoted to an administrative position as the Dean of Johns Hopkins University's School of Engineering from 1938 to 1954. During his tenure as dean, Kouwenhoven developed and perfected his most famous project on the electric cardiac defibrillator. At the age of 68, William Kouwenhoven retired as dean but continued to focus on his medical research at Hopkins after retirement. By the end of his career at Hopkins, Kouwenhoven was awarded with two awards for his work at the institution: the Edison Medal (1961) and the Albert Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award.  Personal life  Kouwenhoven's colleagues and family members recall him as a \\"fascinating guy.According to Guy Knickerbocker, one of Kouwenhoven's electrical engineering students, Kouwenhoven's nickname 'Wild Bill' \\"carried some credibility. Being brought up in Brooklyn, he was colorful. On the other hand, he [also] had a generous side.\\" One of Kouwenhoven's grandchildren, Nick Kouwenhoven who currently works for Tessco Technologies in Baltimore, remembers his grandfather to be \\"an extremely intense and competitive man. As a teacher, he was known for being demanding, but...he secretly paid for kids who showed promise to go to school.\\" Further statements by Nick reveal that William Kouwenhoven \\"was a complicated man; he could be charming and then reveal his underlying stubborn nature. [However, he] was always trying to improve upon his work. Many family dinners included his graduate students, and the conversation frequently turned to the subject of their work.\\" Gil Kaisler was amongst one of these graduate students and had helped design the original portable AC generator used to build the closed-chest defibrillator. According to Kaisler, Kouwenhoven was a \\"tinkerer, a builder of things from the ground up. He also excelled as a teacher and administrator, but in the far grander scale, he did something to help countless people.\\"  Electric cardiac defibrillator = Open-chest defibrillator  By the 20th century, electricity was gradually integrated into society. Due to his interest in the field, William Kouwenhoven began to rewire old houses with electricity when he was college graduate. However, a problem arose when utility linemen, who were setting up electricity lines, started to die from ventricular fibrillation (VF).James Jude, William Kouwenhoven, and Guy Knickerbocker William Kouwenhoven's research focused on the effects of electricity on the heart, and he wanted to develop an instrument that would revive or shock the heart without invasive surgery. The first procedures were done on rats and dogs, but both investigations failed to produce groundbreaking results. Then, in 1925, the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health was offered a $10,000 award by the Consolidated Edison of New York in collaboration with Simon Flexner and the Rockefeller Institute to investigate and examine the effects of electricity on the human body. The principal investigator of this Consolidated Edison study, Johns Hopkins neurologist Othello Langworthy, brought William Kouwenhoven, who was currently the professor of electrical engineering, to this team. By 1928, Kouwenhoven and his team were able to observe the effects of DC and AC shock on the heart. They noticed that when low-voltage shocks were applied to the heart, ventricular fibrillation was induced. Kouwenhoven also discovered that high voltage shocks from the electrodes placed on the rats' heads resulted in the heart to stop pumping blood because the lungs had shut down completely. Another method Kouwenhoven used to revive the hearts of rats was by giving CPR and massaging their chests. However, this failed because massaging the chests resulted in the paralysis of the rats due to their crushed cervical spines. By the year 1933, Kouwenhoven switched his research focus onto dogs. He detected that delivering a second surge of electricity, also known as a countershock, led to the restoration of the sinus rhythm and normal heart contraction. The dog's heart originally went through ventricular fibrillation, which occurs when the heart goes through rapid, electric impulses. However, through a process called defibrillation, the heart was able to be revived. The news of Kouwenhoven's finding began altering the approach to cardiac care. Despite the high risks of the procedure, it was used by doctors at Case Western School of Medicine. In 1947, Claude Beck, M.D., became the first surgeon ever to place electrodes directly on a heart that was in ventricular fibrillation during a surgery. Kouwenhoven's studies also influenced the Division of Anesthesiology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. In the 1940s, researchers James Elam and Peter Safir perfected the emergency mouth-to-mouth method of lung ventilation, which is essential for oxygenating the blood when the heart is no longer functioning. left  Closed-chest defibrillator  In 1950, Kouwenhoven began his research on a closed-chest defibrillator. Alfred Blalock, the Chief of Surgery at the time, was dubious at first regarding Kouwenhoven's ideas. However, he soon agreed to provide laboratory space and equipment for Kouwenhoven's studies. At first, Kouwenhoven and his team monitored the effect of electrodes on the opposite sides of the chest. They noted that a brief AC current of 20 amperes was able to jolt a heart from ventricular fibrillation back into a normal sinus rhythm. Samuel Talbot, a surgeon who was studying heart arrhythmias in dogs at the time, asked Kouwenhoven to merge his research on a defibrillator with Talbot's studies. Afterwards, Kouwenhoven observed that the current flowed best vertically instead of horizontally when passed through a dog's heart. By noticing this, he was able to decrease the shock's intensity by 50 percent. By 1957, Kouwenhoven and his team had designed a prototype specifically to work on humans. This novel device weighed approximately 200 pounds and consisted of a small box with two insulated cables with copper electrodes, which administered an AC current. One electrode was to be placed over the suprasternal notch, and the other electrode was to be placed over the apex of the heart. In 1961, Kouwenhoven and his team were able to launch the first truly portable defibrillator with the help and support of Mine Safety Appliance Company of Pittsburg. This new portable device weighed 45 pounds, and it could fit in a small plastic suitcase. Guy Knickerbocker, an electrical engineer working at Kouwenhoven's laboratory, discovered that the copper electrodes caused a rise in blood pressure in the rest of the body when they were pressed down onto a dog's chest even before the current was passed through them. He hypothesized that massaging the chest in a rhythmical manner causes the blood to circulate. This observation paved the path for the third major discovery by Kouwenhoven's team: cardiopulmonary resuscitation also known as CPR.Cavagnaro, Louise, and Barbara J. Kiviat. \\"Simply CPR.\\" Johns Hopkins Magazine Apr. 2000: n. pag. Print. Closed-Chest Defibrillator developed at Johns Hopkins University.  First successful case  In the year 1957, the defibrillator was used for the first time to save the life of a patient suffering from ventricular defibrillation in an operating room at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Around 2 a.m., a patient entered the Hopkins emergency room complaining of indigestion. While undressing for his examination, the patient collapsed when his heart went into ventricular fibrillation. The resident at the time, Gottlieb Friesinger, M.D., had assisted Kouwenhoven in some his studies dealing with the closed-chest defibrillator. As the intern performed CPR on the patient's chest, Friesinger rushed to the laboratory located on the hospital's 11th floor. He managed to persuade the security officer to let him take the defibrillator, which was mounted on a wheeled-cart. After arriving back to the ER, Friesinger administered the first shock, which failed to restart the patient's heart. However, the second shock was able to revive the patient's heart back to a normal sinus rhythm. It was discovered afterwards that the patient had suffered an anterior myocardial infarction. This case became known as the world's first emergency defibrillation for a cardiac arrest. Friesinger later remarked that \\"he was quite a dramatic Saturday morning Grand Rounds presentation.\\"  Awards and accomplishments  After being appointed as the Associate Dean of the School of Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, Kouwenhoven was also offered the position of vice-president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE). He served as the vice-president from 1931 to 1933 and two years later became a member of the AIEE Board of Directors. In 1961, Kouwenhoven received the IEEE Edison Medal presented by the AIEE (now IEEE) \\"for his inspiring leadership in education, for his contributions in the fields of electrical insulation, electrical measurements, and electrical science applied to medicine.\\" In 1969, Kouwenhoven became the first ever recipient of an honorary degree presented by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine for his contributions to the medical science. Two years before his death, in 1973, Kouwenhoven was presented with one of the most prestigious biomedical prizes in America: the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research. When he died in 1975, the New York Times obituary recognized Kouwenhoven's accomplishments and contributions by stating that he had \\"developed the basic cardiac treatment devices and procedures used worldwide.\\" In Kouwenhoven's honor and memory, the Whiting School of Engineering at Johns Hopkins University established the William B. Kouwenhoven Professorship in Electrical Engineering in 1981. The current holder of this Kouwenhoven Professorship is Jerry L. Prince, the associate director for research at the Center of Computer Integrated Surgical Systems and Technology. Prince has worked on co-developing HARP MRI, which provides doctors with the ability to assess the condition of heart muscles within seconds. He is also currently researching image processing and computer vision with primary application to medical imaging.  Publications  Hooker DR, Kouwenhoven WB, Langworthy OR.

In 1661 his superiors sent him, together with the Belgian Father Albert Dorville (D'Orville), to Rome in order to defend Schall's work on the Chinese calendar (He was accused of encouraging 'superstitious practices'). As it was impossible to journey by sea on account of the blockade of Macau by the Dutch, they conceived the daring idea of going overland from Peking to Goa (India) by way of Tibet and Nepal. This led to Grueber's memorable journey (Dorville died on the way), which won him fame as one of the most successful explorers of the seventeenth century (Tonnier). They first travelled to Sinning-fu, on the borders of Kan-su; thence through the Kukunor territory and Kalmyk Tartary (Desertum Kalnac) to Lhasa. They crossed the difficult mountain passes of the Himalayas, arrived at Kathmandu, Nepal, and thence descended into the basin of the Ganges: Patna and Agra, the former capital of the Mughal empire. This journey lasted 214 days. Dorville died at Agra, a victim of the hardships he had undergone. Jesuit Father Heinrich Roth, a Sanskrit scholar, substituted for Dorville and with Grueber carried on the overland journey through Persia and Turkey, reaching Rome on the 2 February 1664. Their journey showed the possibility of a direct overland connection between China and India, and the value and significance of the Himalayan passes. Biographer Richard Tronnier says: \\"It is due to Grueber's energy that Europe received the first correct information concerning Thibet and its inhabitants\\". Although Oderico of Pordenone had traversed Tibet, in 1327, and visited Lhasa, he had not written any account of this journey. Antonio de Andrada and Manuel Marquez had pushed their explorations as far as Tsaparang on the northern Setledj. Emperor Leopold I requested that Grueber return to China via Russia in order to explore the possibility of another land route through central Asia, but the journey ended at Constantinople as Grueber fell seriously sick. He was obliged to return. Though in poor health Grueber lived another 14 years as preacher and spiritual guide in the Jesuit schools of Trnava (Slovakia) and S√°rospatak (Hungary) where he died in 1680. Literature on his journey Statues of the Fifth Dalai Lama and (apparently) G√ºshi Khan seen by Grueber in the lobby of Dalai Lama's palace An account of this first journey through Tibet in modern times by a European was published by Athanasius Kircher to whom Grueber had left his journals and charts, which he had supplemented by numerous verbal and written additions (\\"China illustrata\\", Amsterdam, 1667, 64-67).

Dutch Formosa In 1636, the Dutch started a school for the Sinckan people that not only featured religious instruction, but also provided schooling in Western literature. Because the Dutch advocated missionary work to be done in the native language, the school was taught in the Sinckan language. The missionary Robertus Junius recorded in his 1643 education report that the Sinckan school had enrolled 80 students, of which 24 were learning to write and 8 to 10 had solid penmanship, while in neighboring Baccaluan (modern-day Anding) school there were 90 students, of which 8 knew how to write. Aside from proselytizing, the missionaries also compiled dictionaries and books of religious doctrine; they translated Gospel of Matthew into Sinckan and also compiled a vocabulary of Favorlang, another aboriginal language. These would become important sources for later research. The most important Sinckan documents were the contracts between the Sinckan and the Han settlers. Qing Dynasty Under Qing dynasty rule, many traditional schools were established, mostly studying Chinese classics such as the teachings of Confucius. Education was limited to the children of well-to- do parents, as public and free schools did not exist. \\"Even the paid schools limited their instruction to the usual Chinese curriculum, which is devoted first to the study of the characters, and, if a higher education is desired, to the mastering of the Chinese classics...There were none of the studies which in western lands and in Japan are considered necessary for an educated man, and the general tendency of their training was to increase conservatism and love for ancient customs.\\" Empire of Japan During the Japanese period school attendance for Taiwanese children increased from 3.8% in 1904 to 71.3% in 1943 and literacy in Taiwan became common. Modern schools were formed with widespread establishment of primary schools while higher schooling for Taiwanese people remained rare and secondary schools and colleges were mostly for Japanese nationals. In special cases Taiwanese did receive higher schooling and many went to Japan for further studies. Republic of China After Taiwan came under control of the Republic of China in 1945, education in Taiwan became a synthesis of the Japanese system and the Chinese system implemented by the Chinese Nationalist government. During the first 20 years of Chinese Nationalist rule, mandatory schooling consisted of six years of primary school education, which was also the length under Japanese rule. In 1968, this was extended to nine years.

The final minutes of the game were seen by many people on ABC, after other regional games ended. Background The Cornhuskers, who had won national championships for the 1994 and 1995 seasons, went into the game with an 8‚Äì0 record and a No. 1 ranking in the AP Poll. They had only given up seven points in their last three games and had beaten the Tigers eighteen straight times. The Tigers were unranked with a 6‚Äì3 record, and in the school‚Äôs history, had never beaten a No. 1 ranked team. The Play In the fourth quarter, Tigers quarterback Corby Jones completed a pass to Eddie Brooks to give Missouri a 38‚Äì31 lead, giving Missouri fans hope that they would beat Nebraska for the first time since 1978 and moving coach Larry Smith to tears. The Huskers took possession from a punt after Missouri failed to convert a first down on their own 33-yard line with 1:02 left. In less than a minute, the Huskers moved the ball 55 yards. The Huskers were on the Missouri 12-yard line with only seven seconds left when Nebraska quarterback Scott Frost threw a pass intended for wingback Shevin Wiggins. The ball hit Wiggins directly in the chest near the goal line. The ball immediately shot down and hit a Missouri safety in the foot and popped back in the air. Then Missouri safety Julian Jones tackled Wiggins as time expired. As Wiggins was pulled to the ground, his leg popped up, kicking the ball into the air for a second time. Cornhuskers receiver Matt Davison leaped for the ball, his hands scraping the turf as he managed to make the catch in the endzone for a touchdown. Missouri fans stormed the field in celebration, thinking they had won. The play could have resulted in a 15-yard penalty (illegal kick) if officials had considered the kick intentional. Instead, they ruled the catch a touchdown. Once fans were cleared from the field, Kris Brown kicked the extra point for Nebraska to send the game into overtime. In OT, Frost ran for a touchdown, and Jones was sacked on 4th and seven by Grant Wistrom to give Nebraska a 45‚Äì38 win. Aftermath Missouri finished the season 7‚Äì5 with a loss to Colorado State in the Holiday Bowl. The Tigers did not defeat the Cornhuskers until 2003, ending a 24-game losing streak in the series. After the game, Wiggins claimed to have kicked the ball intentionally to keep the play alive, and some of his statements indicate that he did so to keep the ball away from Missouri defenders. He also at various times and in later interviews claimed to have been trying to kick the ball back to himself for a catch. Regardless, the outcome of the game could not be changed after the fact, despite the kick leading to Nebraska's win. The legality of the play remains in dispute among college football fans and experts, as NCAA rules at the time generally made it illegal for an intentional kick (by players other than kickers and punters) but also allowed players to use any part of their bodies - including feet - to help themselves catch a forward pass. Furthermore, the rules only allowed officials to establish intent to kick only as they could determine clearly on the field of play. Although Nebraska dropped to No. 3 in the AP Poll the following week, they were still undefeated, and national title hopes were still alive. The Cornhuskers defeated Iowa State and Colorado in the last two games of the regular season and beat Texas A&M; 54‚Äì15 in the Big 12 Championship Game. Nebraska went on to defeat Peyton Manning and No. 3 Tennessee 42‚Äì17 in the 1998 Orange Bowl to finish the season 13‚Äì0. The Cornhuskers had a No. 1 ranking in the Coaches Poll, giving them a third national championship in four seasons. However, they had to split the championship with the 12‚Äì0 Michigan Wolverines who defeated No. 8 Washington State 21‚Äì16 in the 1998 Rose Bowl and ended the season topping the AP Poll. Significance The Flea Kicker was ranked No. 11 on The Best Damn Sports Show Period's list of Top 50 Amazing Catches. The Flea Kicker was also being recreated for the Fox Sports Net program Sport Science in an episode called \\"Bet You Can't Do It Again\\".

Distribution This sprite is endemic to South Africa, where it is rare and localised in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga. Habitat Grass-lined or sedge-lined streams in hilly or mountainous country. Much of this riparian habitat has been transformed by cropping, trampling by livestock and invasion by shrubs and trees. The harlequin sprite is, therefore, no longer found in much of its former range, and its survival is threatened. Description Mature male: The face is bright orange, and the top of the head is black with bright orange postocular spots joined by a line of the same colour. The eyes are reddish-brown above and yellow-brown below. The upper thorax is black with orange antehumeral stripes and the sides are green to blue. The abdomen is black above, except for S7 to S10, which are bright blue above. The wings are clear with reddish-brown pterostigmata.

In 1913, the Greenwich Academy Board of Trustees formally approved the decision to accept only girls in the Middle and Upper Schools, and Greenwich Academy was reconceived as a day school for girls. The newly chartered school was led by strong female educators, including Ruth West Campbell, who shaped much of the mission and philosophy of the school. Succeeding heads‚ÄîKatherine Zierleyn, Alexander A. Uhle and Patsy G. Howard‚Äîoversaw impressive growth in the facilities and student body and expanded the academic and extracurricular offerings. In July 2004, Molly H. King, an educator firmly committed to modeling excellence and sustaining the school‚Äôs strong tradition of female leadership, was appointed as head.  Coordination  Since 1971, Greenwich Academy has had a coordinated relationship with the all-boys Brunswick School. Brunswick's upper school is located across the street from GA and high school students take classes on both campuses. As a result, almost all high school classes at GA and Brunswick are co-ed. Together the two high schools offer more than 400 sections of ~200 courses, with 80+ honors and advanced placement classes.  Signature programs = Engineering & Design Lab  Greenwich Academy's Engineering & Design Lab (EDL) was established in 2013 to encourage and foster community using creativity and new technologies across diverse curricula. It is a fully equipped, digital fabrication space with machines including 3D printers, laser cutters, vinyl cutters, and CNC machines. In addition to digital manufacturing capabilities, the space offers carpentry and hand-building tools, microcontrollers, electronics, and a wide variety of materials for building. Students and faculty across divisions have access to the space and support for their projects. The lab's director, Erin Riley, is a Senior FabLearn Fellow out of Stanford University's Transformative Learning Technologies Lab.  GAINS (Girls Advancing in STEM) Network  The GAINS (Girls Advancing in STEM) Network was founded by Greenwich Academy in 2011 to provide an online social platform for young women with a passion for science, technology, engineering and math. Through the network girls connect with each other and with women working and studying in STEM fields to support, encourage, teach and inspire one another. Membership is open to any high school serving girls (public or private, single gender or coeducational). Since 2015, the GAINS Conference has been held each spring in partnership with top research universities and corporations. The three-day conferences have been held at MIT (2015), Duke University and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (2016), Silicon Valley (2017), New York City at the offices of Oath (2018), and University of Pennsylvania (2019). Daedalus Art and Literary Magazine  Daedalus, Greenwich Academy's art and literary magazine was established in 1986 and has earned 22 Gold Medalists from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association, 15 Highest Awards from the National Council of Teachers of English, and 14 Crowns from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association.

(RSI)Reality Simulations, Inc out of Tempe, Arizona, where players, called managers, design and run up to five warriors per team against other managers. The game is one of the longest- running play-by-mail games still operating. It has been cited by Greg Lindahl's PBM page as one that is most talked aboutPlay by Mail Games Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and has been a standard against which other gladiatorial PBM games have been measured. It is credited with inspiring at least one online gladiator game called Gladiator. One of the earliest examples of a massively multi-player role playing computer program, Duel2 turns feature fight results, a newsletter with standings, personal ads, and team spotlights. Players contribute to newsletters in the form of musings, insults, and fiction. Gameplay alternates between tournaments, held about every 3 months, and the arena, which fights every two weeks. Usually 2 tournaments a year are held 'Face-to-Face' and include reading aloud of fight printouts for championship matches. Face-to-Face tournaments also incorporate alliances as teams to share strategy, tactics, and intelligence. In the 1980s, managers were primarily based in Arizona and California, though the game grew worldwide by word of mouth and through trial tournaments held at major gaming conventions.  History  Introduced in the 1980s, the game was initially known as Duelmasters. In 1985, the game tied with Pellic Quest, Power, and Quest of the Great Jewels for Third Place in the 1st Annual Paper Mayhem Awards for \\"Best PBM Game\\". In 1987, reviewer John Kelley noted in Paper Mayhem, a magazine for play-by-mail games, that the game had \\"no peers in its particular PBM genre\\" and it was \\"the finest example of individual combat you'll find short of figuring out how to get back to Rome in about 100 A.D.\\". The game continues to provide a play-by-mail format which gives managers something to look forward to in the mail. Set in the land of Alastari, DUEL2 pits managers against each other through their warriors.  Game Play  DUEL2 consists of managers sending in individual strategies for their warriors which are matched against each other through a computer program to produce a printed battle which puts the player right with their warrior in the arena. After the fight is over, if the warrior is alive, the warrior improves, if possible, and then the player gets another chance to try their strategy again. If a player's warrior dies, then another roll-up is sent to the player to begin a new warrior.  Getting Started  A player receives a roll-up sheet with five warriors on it. The player will name the warriors, determine their attributes, and select a gender and fighting style for their future gladiators. Once this is done, the sheet will be mailed back to RSI. These warriors have seven attributes consisting of: Strength, Constitution, Size, Wit, Will, Speed, & Deftness. Each of these attributes has an initial value between 3 and 21. The total of all of the attributes is 70. The player then gets to assign 14 points to their attributes, with the stipulations that no attribute can be greater than 21 and no attribute can have more than 6 points added to it. The player must also select a fighting style. There are ten total styles that include \\"insane marauder types\\" such as Bashers, Slashers, and Lungers, to finesse styles. These styles are: Bashing Attack, Striking Attack, Slashing Attack, Parry-Strike Style, Lunging Attack, Parry-Lunge Style, Wall of Steel Style, Total Parry, Aimed Blow Attack Style, & Parry-Riposte. Each style has a group of weapons which are best used by that style as well as strengths and weaknesses in the way the warriors fight. Once the information is completed and mailed in to RSI, a team of gladiators is produced in the form of warrior overviews and assigned to an arena. The arena is the local home of the warriors where they will fight on a regular basis and vie for the honor of being called the best warrior in the arena, the Duelmaster. The player is sent the warrior overviews with a copy of their arena's newsletter and turn sheets.Duel2.Com - Content  Playing the game =Regular arenaDuel2.Com - Content The game is played by taking the warrior overview and developing a strategy to beat a player's opponents in the arena. These victories give the warrior a chance at glory and give their managers a chance to gloat. There are several factors that go into this. The turn sheet is the means for submitting the strategy for the warrior(s). Exact format can vary slightly according to what the sheet is intended for, but in general these sheets are half-page documents with printing on both sides. It is up to the individual player to decide whether to fill in both sides or not. The turn sheet requests identifying information for the warrior and the manager first and the strategy second. The individual strategy consists of selecting weapons, selecting Offensive Efforts (OE), Activity Levels (AL), Kill Desires (KD), Attack Locations, Protect Locations, Offensive Tactics, Defensive Tactics, Armor, Head Protection, Desired Training, Challenges, Avoids, and whether the player wishes an alternate strategy for Challenges, whether the player's or another player's. The player gets twenty-two weapons that can be selected, regardless of whether the warrior is capable of wielding them effectively or not. The OE, AL, and KD are a number between 1-10 which the player selects. Attack and Protect Locations are the places where the warrior will try to concentrate their attacks. In the tactics section, warriors can choose to use a tactic for offense or defense or both which will make them concentrate on a particular portion of their overall abilities. The game offers seven types of armor and four choices of head protection, not including the option of fighting with no armor or helmet. Training is either to increase an attribute (except size) or to learn skills. Challenges allow the player to request a fight against up to two specific warriors. Avoids allow the player to request that their warrior not face warriors from up to two specific teams. And in the event that a Challenge goes through, the player may wish to use an alternate strategy and this is what goes on the back of the turn sheet. A sheet is filled out for each warrior and can have the same or different strategies for each. These are sent to RSI. RSI plugs the information into their game and, on a specified day, they run all of the warriors submitted for that turn. The output of the game is individual fights where warriors using managers' strategies have clashed against other warriors using their managers' strategies. Warriors win or lose and, sometimes, kill or are killed. If the warrior survives, the game determines if the warrior gets their stat train or skills. If the warrior dies, a replacement roll-up is sent to the player to fill the gap from their fallen warrior. The warrior also gets some new information at this point. These new factors are a recognition rating, a class ranking, and a popularity rating. The recognition rating is a number on the newsletter which is determined by the system based on several factors such as winning or losing the fight, how the player won or lost the fight, killing their opponent, etc. Based on the number of recognition points the warrior has they fall into a class ranking. Class ranking is important because it dictates who the warrior can challenge and be challenged by. The warrior also gains or loses popularity with the spectators, although there is no number that the player can see for this. The player is told at the end of each fight if their warrior increased or decreased in popularity. All of the warriors who fought that turn are included in a newsletter that is sent to the managers with their fights. The newsletter shows how all the teams and warriors are ranked, gives a spy report summarizing some of the highlights and lowlights of the turn, and also gives a space for managers to taunt, encourage, role-play, or almost anything else. (Please note, RSI reserves the right to delete messages which fall outside of their definition of appropriate.) Armed with the new newsletter and fights, the managers fill out new turn sheets and the process begins again. Depending on the arena, these turns are run every 14 or 28 days. The company also offers an option of placing the teams on 'maintenance' which means they keep rerunning the strategy submitted each turn without challenges or avoids. Warriors progress until they are qualified to enter Advanced DUEL2 (AD). Advanced DUEL2  Once a warrior reaches a certain level of recognition and skill, the Lady Greywand may choose (and always has chosen) to invite the warrior to participate in Advanced DUEL2. Once this invitation is made, the warrior gets one final fight in their regular arena and then are transferred into the AD arena chosen by the player. The player can 'retire' the warrior as well, which is the managers' term for no longer running the warrior. AD has several benefits. Selection bestows immortality to the warrior which means that even being killed will result in their resurrection. The warrior is also given their favorites. Every warrior has a favorite weapon, OE, AL, skill learn, and, sometimes, tactic(s). AD warriors can increase all attributes (except Size) to 25 points. Additionally, warriors now get to face other warriors from across the game, giving the player new opponents. AD strategies are no different from regular arena strategies in the options available, however the level of play is viewed by many to increase. Warriors continue to train their skills and attributes to improve the warriors. Recognition ratings and popularity remain the same, however the classes are new at this level. The official goal of AD warriors is PRIMUS.Duel2.Com - Content PRIMUS PRIMUS is the highest level of play for warriors in DUEL2 at this time. Warriors fighting in PRIMUS gain the ability to learn additional skills and any skills lost due to attribute trains as well as entering a unique ranking format which no longer concentrates on recognition points. In PRIMUS, warriors are ranked from #1 to the lowest warrior and the only way for a warrior to move up is to beat someone above them. The top warrior in PRIMUS is considered the best warrior in DUEL2. At least, for a few weeks they are... Tournaments DUEL2 regularly sponsors tournaments throughout the year. Tournaments allow warriors for every arena to compete against each other. The training in tournaments is only half as effective, but the chances of death are also decreased by half. The basic warriors are grouped according to the number of Fights Experience (FE) they have into Rookies (0 FE), Apprentices (1-4 FE), Initiates (5-10 FE), Adepts (11-20 FE), Champions (21-30 FE), Challengers (31-99 FE). AD warriors are grouped by a system which has not been released to managers, although speculation abounds among managers. The AD classifications are Freshman, AD, Eligibles, Contenders & PRIMUS. When a tournament is announced, managers are sent mini-overviews which specify what tournament their warriors will be fighting in. This information is based on the warrior's status at the time the mini-overview is printed, so a later fight may change the warrior's status. Changes to the warrior's status occur right up to the tournament, since regular arena fights are run up to the day of the tournament in most cases. ;Prizes The lowest level prize is being classified as a Tournament Victor. Tournament Victors get to make a 'T.V. Challenge' each turn in their regular arena which gets precedence over other challenges. The champion of that class is the Tournament Champion. Tournament Champions get a 'T.C. Challenge' each turn and also fight for free for six months. In addition, the Tournament Champion wins a prize for his manager which is announced at the same time the tournament is announced. There are several tournament formats: ;Mail-in Tournament, Normal These tournaments have a double or triple elimination format based on strategies which are mailed in to RSI in advance. The player typically can specify an alternate strategy against up to five fighting styles, although they only get to specify one alternate strategy for all of them. After ten rounds, any warrior who is not eliminated is declared a Tournament Victor. After ten rounds, all non-eliminated warriors compete until only one warrior remains and is declared the Tournament Champion. AD is similar with the single exception that all AD warriors are guaranteed five fights. After their fifth fight, all warrior with too many losses are eliminated and the rest continue. ;Mail-in Tournament, Fools Format These tournaments have a triple elimination format, but any warrior who loses their first two fights goes into a Fools Tournament for each class. Play in the regular tournament progresses like a normal mail-in tournament. The Fools Tournament remains a triple elimination tournament, however the warriors all start at the same point. Remaining through the tenth round still bestows the title of Tournament Victor on those warriors in the Fool's Tournament. AD tournament follows a similar format. ;Mail-in Tournament, Tourney of the Dead These tournaments run like a normal mail-in tournament for 'live' warriors, but another set of basic classes are opened for the dead warriors who wish to compete. In addition to being declared a TV or TC, any warrior who remains in the tournament after the tenth round is resurrected. ;Face-To-Face Tournament These tournaments are double or triple elimination and follow the same format as a normal Mail-in tournament with the exception that the player can actually come to the site where the tournament will be run and submit a new strategy for each round. Managers can also designate proxy's to submit changes for them. Face-To-Face's (FTFs) run over a three-day period and are held at different locations approximately every six months. ;Bloodgames Typically run at FTFs, these tournaments are held with ten new warriors for each player in a format where win-loss does not matter as much as slaying the other warriors. The chances of warriors dying increases significantly, making the games... \\"bloody\\". These tournaments run ten turns and the three highest ranked warriors of different styles are awarded a free pass to AD. These tournaments can be 'mail-in' format or 'FTF' format. Mail-in format means the player gives each warrior one strategy and the games are run. FTF format means the player can change strategies between fights.  Goals  The game was initially created with the goal of being the 'Duelmaster' in mind, but it has evolved to a point where managers can set numerous goals in their gameplay. Some of the more common goals include: Get and maintain a winning record, become Duelmaster of the arena, graduate a warrior to Advanced Duel2, graduate a team of warriors to Advanced Duel2, graduate a warrior from each style to Advanced Duel2, win a Tournament Victor status, win a Tournament Champion status, join an alliance and many more. Reception Reg Reid reviewed Duelmasters in The Space Gamer No. 75. Reid commented that \\"In summary, I would say that this game shows promise and is a good value for the money. For those whose tastes run to one-on-one combat and to narrative exposition, I would suggest that it be given a try.\\" See also List of play-by-mail games  Notes and references =Notes References =Bibliography  * External links *Duel2 Rules *Terrablood's Duel2 Archives Category:Fantasy games Category:Play-by-mail games ","title":"Duel2"},{"id":"12711103","text":"Pseudagrion salisburyense is a species of damselfly in the family Coenagrionidae.

Origins During the 1830s, the Manchester Mechanics' Institute was failing to attract students to its science lectures. On 21 March 1839, a meeting was held at the York Hotel to discuss the possibility of establishing an institution aimed solely at science education. The meeting was chaired by Hugh Hornby Birley, the leader of the troops at the Peterloo Massacre in 1819, who revelealed that the project was to be based on Jacob Perkins' Adelaide Gallery of Practical Science in London and was to:Kargon (1977) pp36-41 *Provide a collection of scientific apparatus \\"combining philosophical instruction and general entertainment\\"; *Present demonstrations of elementary physical principles; *Exhibit progress in the application of science to industry; *Establish awards to foster learning and invention; and *Appeal to young people. William Fairbairn, Eaton Hodgkinson and John Davies were all at the meeting and gave their enthusiastic support. A prospectus was published in the Manchester Guardian seeking to raise capital through a joint-stock company, representing the Gallery as a sound financial investment. A committee was established to create the new Gallery and included, Hodgkinson, Fairbairn, Davies and Richard Roberts, the last three, all founders of the Mechanics' Institute. Annual subscriptions were to be offered at one guinea with two guinea family subscriptions. The admission fee was to be one shilling, beyond the means of most of the Victorian working class and a rival committee held a meeting on 4 April proposing a not-for- profit alternative but without realising any of their ambitions. In due course, William Sturgeon was retained as superintendent of the Gallery and Queen Victoria was prevailed upon to offer her patronage. The Gallery The Gallery opened in June 1840 in the Exchange Dining Room. The exhibition comprised artistic and scientific exhibits including: *Dial weighing machines; *Mathematical instruments designed by William Read; *Fossils excavated during the construction of the Manchester and Leeds Railway; *A model of Wheatstone and Cooke's electric telegraph; *Electromagnets; *A ball and socket valve from Sharp, Roberts and Company; *Surface plates from Whitworth & Co.; *A \\"spectacular\\" electrotype engraving by Sturgeon of Richard I leaving Cyprus.Morus (1998) p.169 The Gallery planned lectures and demonstrations and the collection of a library was started. In February 1841, Sturgeon promoted James Prescott Joule's first public lecture at the Gallery and the directors were sanguine about the Gallery's prospects. However, ultimately, there proved to be insufficient local people willing to pay the admission fee and the Gallery closed in 1842. Joule observed: Aftermath The Gallery's collections were transferred, some sold, some donated, to the Royal Manchester Institution. Sturgeon attempted to revive the concept in the Manchester Institute of Natural and Experimental Science but it failed a shortly after it opened. The Gallery had been one of several similar institutions established in the 1830s and 1840s, all of which quickly closed. It has been suggested that their promoters, such as Sturgeon, had overrated the public's appetite for science and its willingness to pay. Further, \\"electricians\\" such as Sturgeon had alienated themselves from the increasingly professionalised scientific establishment represented by the Royal Society and the Royal Institution, denying themselves the experience and expertise in managing scientific enterprises.Morus (1998) pp122-123 ReferencesBibliography  Category:1839 establishments in England Category:1842 disestablishments in England Category:History of Manchester Category:Scientific organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:19th century in Manchester Category:Educational organisations based in England Category:Education in Manchester ","title":"Royal Victoria Gallery for the Encouragement of Practical Science"},{"id":"12711117","text":"Einar Liberg (16 October 1873 - 9 September 1955) was a Norwegian rifle shooter who competed in the early 20th century.

The device is particularly useful in instances where the radiation fields inside a nuclear facility are unknown but required in order to plan a suitable nuclear decommissioning strategy. The device has been developed by the UK's National Nuclear Laboratory and consists of an inner spherical core made of a radiation sensitive material and an outer tungsten based collimation sheath. The device does not require any electrical supply or communication link and can be deployed remotely thus eliminating the need for radiation exposure to personnel. In addition to this, the device has a very wide target dose range of between 2 and 5,000 rads (20 mGy to 50 Gy) which makes the technology widely applicable to nuclear decommissioning applications. The device The device consists of two constituent parts, a gamma radiation sensitive inner core which fits inside the spherical tungsten outer collimation sheath. The outside diameter of the device is 140 mm (approx 5 ¬Ω inch) which allows deployment in to hard to reach areas whilst providing a 360 degree view of the area. The inner core is made up of material which changes colour when it is exposed to gamma radiation. Therefore, when the device is deployed inside a radioactive environment the collimation device preferentially allows gamma radiation to pass through the collimation holes which deposits tracks within the inner core. These tracks can then be analysed to provide a 3D visualisation of the radioactive environment predicting both source location and intensity. Deployment and retrieval The overall radiation mapping service based on the device consists of six individual steps. Step 1 involves placing the device inside the given contaminated area with a known position and orientation. This can be achieved in a number of ways including deployment by crane, robot, by an operator or (as in most cases) by a remotely operated manipulator arm. The device can be orientated either upright or upside down. Once the device has been placed in position, Step 2 involves leaving the device in-situ to enable dose uptake. Once the device has been left in-situ and has achieved a suitable dose uptake (between 2 and 5,000 rads), Step 3 involves removing the device from the contaminated area. Once clearance has been given, Step 4 involves removing the radiation sensitive core from within the collimation device, ensuring that it has not rotated or moved during the deployment period. Analysis and visualisation Step 5 involves scanning the radiation sensitive core using an optical technique which digitises the information captured by the inner core. Step 6 involves the interpretation of this data set to produce a final visualisation. For each detected track within the inner core special software creates a line of best fit for the data points provided and chooses the direction of the track by using the intensity values. This line of best fit is extrapolated until it intersects with a wall of the deployment volume. This indicates that the radiation source is on the wall at this location or anywhere along the line of site between the device and the point on the wall. If two devices are deployed in different locations within the same deployment area, triangulation can be used to predict where along the extrapolated line the radiation source is. Benefits over existing technology A number of alternative technologies and approaches do exist ranging from the use of GM based detectors mounted on a manipulator and moved around a radioactive cell to heavily shielded and collimated gamma-based camera. The technology tested here does have a number of advantages over the aforementioned. With regards to the GM / manipulator approach, the technology has directional awareness, an ability to distinguish separate sources which are in close proximity, there is no need for a power or data umbilical and the technology can be used in areas where a manipulator is not present. With regards to the heavily collimated gamma camera technology, the technology also has a number of advantages including a much more compact size, less weight, no power and data umbilical as well as offering a lower financial risk should the equipment become contaminated. Deployment history The technology has been successfully deployed a number of times throughout the USA and the UK as described below. Savannah River Site, USA The earliest lab based tests undertaken on the original version of the technology was performed at the Savannah River Site (SRS) Health Physics Instrument Calibration Laboratory (HPICL) using various gamma-ray sources and an x-ray machine with known radiological characteristics. The objective of these preliminary tests was to identify the optimal target dose and collimator thickness of the device. The second set of tests involved the deployment of device in a contaminated Hot Cell in order to characterise the radiation sources within. This work is described in a number of previous publications, primarily in a report commissioned by the US Department of Energy,Farf√°n, Eduardo B., Trevor Q. Foley, Timothy G. Jannik, John R. Gordon, Larry J. Harpring, Steven J. Stanley, Christopher J. Holmes, Mark Oldham and John Adamovics. 2009. \\"Testing of the RadBall Technology at Savannah River National Laboratory Savannah River National Laboratory report.\\" but also in a number of journal publications. and general industrial news outlets.SRNL and NNL Collaborate on RadBall Trials Hanford Site, USA Further testing of the original deceive was undertaken in order to demonstrate that the technology could locate submerged radiological hazards. This study involved, for the first time, underwater deployments at the US Department of Energy Hanford Site. This study represents the first successful underwater deployment of technology and a further step in demonstrating that the technology has the ability to be remotely deployed with no electrical supplies into difficult to access areas and locate radiation hazards. This study was part of ongoing work to investigate whether the technology is able to characterize more complex radiation environments as described previously. Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA A number of trials took place at the US Department of Energy Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) during December 2010 as described previously. The overall objective for these trials was to demonstrate that a newly developed technology could be used to locate, quantify and characterise the radiological hazards within two separate Hot Cells (B and C). For Hot Cell B, the primary objective of demonstrating that the technology could be used to locate, quantify and characterise 3 radiological sources has been met with 100% success. Despite more challenging conditions in Hot Cell C, two sources were detected and accurately located. To summarise, the technology performed extremely well with regards to detecting and locating radiation sources and, despite the challenging conditions, moderately well when assessing the relative energy and intensity of those sources. Sellafield Site, UK More recently during Winter 2011 the technology was successfully deployed on the UK's Sellafield Site in order to map the whereabouts of numerous radioactive containers within a Shielded Cell Facility. This particular project involved the deployment of three devices and represents the first instance in which triangulation was demonstrated. Overall the technology performed well by locating and quantifying around a dozen sources. This work package was undertaken in partnership with Sellafield Ltd.

A shere hog is a castrated ram after its first shearing. History The church was originally dedicated to St Osyth. Sise Lane in the parish uses an abbreviated form of the saint's name. The historian John Stow believed that the later dedication of \\"Benet Sherehog\\" was derived from a corruption of the name of Bennet Shorne, a benefactor of the church in the reign of Edward II. The patronage of the church belonged to the monastery of St Mary Overy until the Dissolution, when it passed to the Crown. Matthew Griffith chaplain to Charles I was rector from 1640 until 1642, when he was removed from the post and imprisoned after preaching a sermon entitled \\"A Pathetical Persuasion to Pray for Publick Peace\\" in St Paul's Cathedral. Destruction St Benet's was one of the 86 parish churches destroyed in the Great Fire of London, and it was not selected to be rebuilt when the 1670 Act of Parliament became law. The parish was united to that of St Stephen Walbrook in the same year, but continued to be represented by its own churchwarden. In 1685, a church report judged the unification a success. Nearly two hundred years later, however, this arrangement was still capable of causing tension. Some of its parish records survive,Genealogical web site and have been collated. The site is now occupied by No 1 Poultry The site of the church was used as a burial-ground for the united parishes until closed by an Act of Parliament in 1853.

Location The church stood in the Walbrook ward, in a narrow lane just to the south of Candlewick Street (now Cannon Street).Seymour 1733, p.479 History St Mary Bothaw was described by Stow as a \\"proper church\\". The dedication is generally derived from \\"boat-haw\\", meaning \\"boat house\\". The church was in existence by 1279, when William de Hamkynton is recorded as becoming rector following the death of Adam Lambyn. It was one of the 13 \\"peculiars\\" within the City under the patronage of the dean and chapter of Canterbury Cathedral. Robert Chichele, Lord Mayor of London, in 1422, was buried in the church. According to some sources, St Mary's also contained the tomb of Henry Fitz-Ailwin de Londonestone, the first Lord Mayor of London, and his coat-of-arms was in a stained-glass window there. John Stow, however, said that he was buried at the priory of the Holy Trinity in Aldgate.Seymour 1733, p.483 Destruction Along with the majority of parish churches in the City, St Mary Bothaw was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666. A Rebuilding Act was passed in 1670 and a committee set up under Sir Christopher Wren to decide which would be rebuilt; St Mary Bothaw was not amongst them. Instead the parish was united to that of St Swithin, London Stone, and some of the materials from St Mary's were used to rebuild that church. The site was retained as a churchyard until the Cannon Street Railway Station was built over it in the nineteenth century.

Being relatively compact in relation to her gun power she was affectionately known as the \\"Little Black Ship\\".Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.41 She was not immediately commissioned for service, but went on to serve during the American War of Independence in a number of theatres. She was initially in the Caribbean, where she fought at the Battle of Grenada, before returning to Britain to join a special expedition under Commodore George Johnstone, to capture the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope. The expedition was surprised by a French fleet at the Battle of Porto Praya and though Johnstone was able to go on and capture several Dutch merchants in the Battle of Saldanha Bay, he did not attempt to attack the Cape. Monmouth, under her Captain James Alms, was sent on with several other warships to reinforce the East Indies station, and she went on to fight in a number of actions under Sir Edward Hughes against French fleets under the Bailli de Suffren. She returned to Britain on the conclusion of the wars and saw no further active service. Renamed Captivity and used as a prison ship from 1796, she served out the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and was broken up in 1818. Construction and commissioning Monmouth was ordered on 10 September 1767, one of the first batch of four ships of the Intrepid class, built to a design drawn up by Sir John Williams in 1765. The order was approved on 22 October 1767, and the name Monmouth assigned in November that year. She was laid down at Plymouth Dockyard in May 1768, under the supervision of Master Shipwright Israel Pownoll and launched from there on 18 April 1772. She was completed at the dockyard between October 1777 and 9 May 1778, after the outbreak of the American War of Independence. Expenditure on the ship by this stage came to ¬£30,586.17.3d, with a further ¬£7,426.15.1d. spent fitting her out. American waters Her first commander, Captain Thomas Collingwood, commissioned her for service in January 1778, and after fitting out she sailed for the Leeward Islands in June 1778 with the squadron under Vice-Admiral John Byron. She came under the command of Captain Robert Fanshawe in 1779, and under him saw action at the Battle of Grenada on 6 July 1779. Monmouth was heavily involved in the fighting with the comte d'Estaing's fleet, and was ordered to Antigua to carry out repairs. She returned to Britain at the end of the year and was refitted and coppered at Portsmouth between December 1779 and December 1780. She recommissioned in late 1780 under the command of Captain James Alms, and was immediately assigned to the squadron under Commodore George Johnstone. Expedition to South Africa and India Johnstone's squadron was dispatched on a secret expedition to capture the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope. Johnstone sailed on his expedition from Spithead on 13 March 1781 in command of 46 ships and 3,000 troops under General Sir William Medows. The French had learned of the expedition's intent through the services of the spy Fran√ßois Henri de la Motte, based in London, and quickly prepared an expedition under Admiral Pierre Andr√© de Suffren to foil Johnstone by beating him to the Cape and reinforcing it. Johnstone at first made for the Cape Verde Islands, anchoring at Porto Praya to take on fresh water. Combat de la baie de la Praia dans l'√Æle de Santiago au Cap Vert, le 16 avril 1781, by Pierre-Julien Gilbert He was surprised at anchor on 16 April by the unexpected arrival of Suffren's squadron, which had also not anticipated finding an enemy force at Porto Praya. The French launched an immediate attack, and it was sometime before the British could respond effectively, eventually driving the French off. Johnstone ordered a pursuit, but his damaged ships were unable to catch up with the French. Suffren sailed directly to the Cape, with Johnstone following after completing repairs. Finding the Dutch forewarned and reinforced on his arrival there, Johnstone did not attempt an attack, instead contenting himself with capturing several Dutch merchants in Saldanha Bay. Johnstone decided to return to Britain with his prizes, detaching the troops and supplies he was escorting for the East Indies station, and sending his best warships under Captain Alms of Monmouth to escort them. East Indies service Depiction of the Battle of Trincomalee on the day of 3 September 1782 by Dominic Serres Alms struggled with adverse winds and high incidences of sickness, eventually forcing him to leave the troopships on the coast of Arabia to bring his warships to reach India in time for the campaigning season. The British fleet rendezvoused with Sir Edward Hughes at Madras on 11 February 1782, and Monmouth went on to be involved in a number of indecisive clashes between Hughes and the Bailli de Suffren; at Sadras on 17 February, Providien on 12 April, Negapatam on 6 July, and Trincomalee on 3 September 1782. Monmouth had a particularly important part in the battle Providien, when she was the second ship in the line to Sir Edward's flagship. At one point in the action, Alms saw that Suffren had put up his helm with a view of boarding Hughes's ship, and brought Monmouth about to defend his commander, the ship receiving heavy fire as he did so. In this engagement, the Monmouth had seven guns dismounted,‚Äîthe wheel twice cleared,‚Äîand two seamen only, besides the captain, left alive on the quarter-deck. Forty-five men were killed, and one hundred and two wounded. Alms himself received two splinter-wounds in the face, and two musket-balls went through his hat. Prison ship and sale Alms brought Monmouth back to Britain at the conclusion of the American War of Independence, and she was paid off in July 1784. She spent a number of years laid up, and was not returned to service on the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars. Instead she was renamed Captivity on 20 October 1796, while laid up at Portsmouth, and was fitted out as a prison ship. She continued in this role for over a decade, serving under a number of commanders, Lieutenant Samuel Blow from December 1796, until his replacement in 1800 by Lieutenant Emanuel Hungerford. She was thereafter commanded by Lieutenant Jacob Silver from September 1801, and then a Lieutenant McDonald from December 1805 until sometime in 1806. She was finally broken up at Portsmouth in January 1818.

Kornbluth. It was first published in 1955 by Ballantine Books and republished in 1986 by Baen Books. Plot introduction The plot is typically topsy-turvy. Whereas in the authors' earlier novel The Space Merchants the world was ruled by advertising agencies, in this novel corporate lawyers, especially the secretive firm of \\"Green, Charlesworth\\", have gained a stranglehold on the world. Business Law is an extremely lucrative career, while Criminal Law pays enough to afford some of the luxuries of life but not enough to save for the future. Success means living in a luxurious automated \\"bubble home\\" constructed by \\"GML\\", a corporation which is nominally public but whose shares are never traded openly. All work contracts include GML housing as part of the pay scale. Not having a contract job means having to live in a community such as \\"Belly Rave\\", originally a post-war suburban development for returning soldiers, now a slum ruled by gangs of teenagers and children. Its original name was \\"Belle R√™ve\\", which is French for \\"Beautiful Dream\\", in ironic contrast to the present ugly reality. For the common people, there are bread-and-circuses entertainments in the form of gladiatorial games of various kinds, with monetary rewards for the winners. Some games pit elderly people against each other armed with padded clubs, but others are more deadly. There are two main protagonists. One is Norvell Bligh, a nebbish designer of game spectacles for a second-rank corporation who is thrown out of his job and his GML home, a victim of office politics. His gold-digger wife, instead of leaving him, returns with him to her roots in the slum, kicking her daughter out to join a gang and bring in some money. The other is Charles Mundin, an attorney scratching out a living in criminal practice, barred from more lucrative commercial work by the licensing monopolies of the large law firms. By chance they encounter siblings Norma and Donald Lavin, who inherited 25% of GML stock from their father, the inventor of the Bubble House. Donald placed the share certificates in a safe deposit box, and then was kidnapped and \\"conditioned\\", as are many common criminals. He can no longer tell anyone where the stock certificates are, and any attempt to obtain duplicate certificates from GML will surely result in more foul play. Helping the Lavins, they discover the truth behind GML and confront \\"Green, Charlesworth\\", whose true nature is more bizarre than anyone could imagine. Plot summary The action takes place in and around a future Monmouth City, New Jersey. The city proper consists of luxurious GML bubble homes which can change shape at the whim of their occupants, and anticipate their every need. At the edge of Monmouth City is the slum of Belly Rave, originally a gimcrack suburb built on a landfill and sold to unsuspecting young couples. Charles Mundin and Norvell Bligh first meet when Bligh is trying to adopt his stepdaughter, mostly at the behest of his upwardly mobile wife, Virginia. Bligh then returns to work on the next gruesomely spectacular Field Day to be organized by his company, while Mundin visits Republican Party headquarters, where he is introduced to the Lavins by his friend, the local Ward Chairman whose brother also knows Bligh. Bligh finds himself tricked out of his job by his assistant, abetted by one of the secretaries who is keen to marry a man with a job whose benefits include a GML home. Bligh is arrested when he tries to drown his sorrows, only to find his company credit card has been cancelled. Mundin uses his political connections to have Bligh freed, but then Bligh and his family are unceremoniously dumped in Belly Rave. Virginia is no stranger to the place, but Bligh needs the help of a local, who calls himself Shep. With Shep's guidance Bligh negotiates the \\"public assistance\\" system which ensures that nobody starves, without actually making life worth living. Shep scrapes together materials so he can paint \\"rainscapes\\", views of Belly Rave in the rain. Other residents indulge in a kind of barter, or petty theft, extortion, and gang crime, or anesthetize themselves with liquor made from the desserts in their ration packs. Virginia, opportunistic as ever, begins eyeing Shep as a replacement for Norvell. Mundin eventually visits the Lavins, who live in a different part of Belly Rave, and meets Ryan, a broken-down corporate attorney addicted to \\"yen-pox\\", an opiate in the form of crude pills. Ryan has a plan for recovering the shares which Donald Lavin hid away before he was brainwashed, but the initial effort at obtaining records from GML result in Norma Lavin being kidnapped. Ryan is strangely elated, as it is evident that GML seems to think their activities are a threat, which could give him some leverage in negotiations. He decides to send Mundin to a shareholder's meeting. This entails buying a GML share on Wall Street, which has become a hybrid stock-market and public casino. Mundin braves the touts and thugs of the market to trick his way to buying a share, normally impossible because of the activities of certain brokers. Hiding out in Belly Rave, he meets Bligh, who has become adept in negotiating with the gangs there. Bligh arranges Mundin's safe passage to the company meeting, in a deliberately obscure building on Long Island. At the meeting Mundin, learning to play off the power brokers against each other, gains access to Norma, who is a \\"guest\\" of one faction. Mundin also gains an ally in Bliss Hubble, a \\"Titan of Industry\\" who sees in the Lavin's shares a way to unseat the faction currently in control of GML. Recruiting a few more Titans to his cause, he takes the entire party to his elaborate GML bubble-house, which is currently configured as a Gothic mansion, thanks to a household servant with a grudge. With Bliss's backing, Ryan and Mundin are suddenly a full-fledged law firm with expensive offices. The plan Bliss hatches is to bankrupt GML rather than indulge in a proxy battle. Mundin is dispatched to sabotage certain GML houses, including the model in the Smithsonian, at the same time spreading rumors through his political connections. Bliss bankrolls some illegal medical treatment for Don Lavin, in order to reverse his brainwashing. After this, they are able to recover the Lavins' stock certificates from a bank in Ohio, where GML was founded. Norvell, meanwhile, is becoming an important man in Belly Rave. His experience catering to crowds in the Field Days allows him to organize the otherwise listless residents to clean the place up and even try some local policing. Shep, meanwhile, has become too close to Virginia, and Bligh has assaulted him with a piece of lead pipe. At this point the much dreaded firm of \\"Green, Charlesworth\\" intervene. They occupy the entire Empire State Building on the otherwise uninhabited island of Manhattan. Rather than send their minions to shut down the plot, they grant Norma Lavin and Mundin an \\"audience\\" at their headquarters. Here they are revealed to be a grotesque pair of ancient human beings, a man and a woman, trapped in husks of bodies in glass cases, but able to exert influence with their minds, their devices, and their money. They own GML and have used it to rule their world. They claim to be centuries old, having \\"fixed Mr. Lincoln's wagon\\" and they threaten to do the same to Mundin and the Lavins. Mundin identifies them as the Struldbrugs described by satirist Jonathan Swift. Returning to their offices, Mundin and Norma find that only Bliss Hubble and the increasingly comatose Ryan are still on their side. They resolve to carry on regardless, but then chaos ensues as listening devices planted by Green, Charlesworth explode around them. In the confusion, Donald disappears, responding to a subliminal signal as if he is still brainwashed. They find him at the Field Day, entered in an event where he walks a tightrope across a pool of piranha while under a hail of rocks from the crowd. Despite their efforts at bribing the mob not to throw anything, aided by threats from Bligh's teenage gangsters, Donald falls into the pool. Bligh is ready to sacrifice himself to save Donald, but instead the tortured artist Shep throws himself in with the fish. Declaring war on GML and Green, Charlesworth, they return to Wall Street, where Mundin starts a run on the market by carefully selling off large chunks of the GML stock. After a while the selling takes on a life of its own, despite the efforts of various people, acting unwittingly on behalf of Green, Charlesworth, to have Mundin arrested on trumped-up charges, or to discourage him from selling. As the market collapses, the plotters are left with large amounts of cash, which they use to buy up GML and other companies at bargain prices. At the end they are counting their riches and savoring their triumph, just as Green, Charlesworth, across the water in Manhattan, destroy themselves in a nuclear explosion. Characters  * Charles Mundin is not a particularly good lawyer, although he can easily out-think the likes of Wilhelm Choate IV, his friend who inherited a large corporate practice from his father Wilhelm Choate III and looks forward to passing the firm and its decades-long bankruptcy cases to his son, Wilhelm Choate V. Mundin is fairly adept at cultivating political contacts, such as his friend Del Dworcas, the Republican Ward Chairman who steers work to him. Del's brother Arnie is an Engineer, which in his case is more of a title than a vocation. Arnie passes Norvell Bligh on to Del, who connects him with Mundin. * Norvell Bligh is a Company man, eagerly organizing the bloody spectacles that keep his boss in business, though the boss chafes at being in a \\"minor league\\" operation and rides his workers hard to compensate. At the beginning of the novel Bligh has to wear a hearing aid, but as he grows as a human being, he suddenly finds that he doesn't need it at all. In parallel he frees himself from his fears of his boss, of his shrewish wife, of his fellow residents of Belly Rave, and finally of Death itself. * Donald and Norma Lavin are the twin children of one of the two co-inventors of the automated, self-maintaining GML House. Donald is naive and childlike as a consequence of being brainwashed. Norma is typical of female characters by the authors, in that she resents the restrictions imposed on her by society, but is even more resentful of being attracted to a man like Mundin who does not treat her like a woman. * Bliss Hubble is rich enough for money not to matter to him. He is instead addicted to power and the pursuit of it. Initially he sees the Lavins as another tool, but when he learns the true nature of Green, Charlesworth he decides that his \\"power\\" was an illusion, and sticks with Mundin and the Lavins after his partners bail out. * Virginia Bligh, the once and future Belly Raver, is a survivor. Sold by her parents, she was lucky to be merely a shill in a pickpocket operation instead of, say, a worker in a brothel. Lying her way into a job as a receptionist, she entices Norvell Bligh into marriage, carefully editing her past to elicit sympathy. She then persuades him to adopt her daughter Alexandra, creating a story of an abusive father. Alexandra is well on her way to becoming an obese parasite when Norvell is outfoxed by his subordinate, who is also being manipulated by a Belly Raver, dumping them back into the slum. Virginia kicks Alexandra out, telling her to join a gang and bring in some money. Alexandra joins \\"Goering's Grenadiers\\", a gang of neo-Nazis. Unfortunately their house is in \\"Wabbit\\" (another gang's) territory. * \\"Shep\\" is a man in the wrong place at the wrong time. Big and beefy enough to survive on the streets of Belly Rave, he wants nothing more than to paint. He spends any money he gets on sending the local gang members to fetch paints from outside the slum. He has entered the Games to raise money for painting, only to find that the emotional trauma of injuring someone to win the money prevents him from painting at all. Virginia Bligh tries to entice him, but Norvell reacts by threatening Virginia and eventually Shep himself. Shep, for his part, is too tortured by his inner demons to be interested in Virginia or to resent Norvell's hostility. The GML House A GML House is an invention, a \\"machine for living in\\" that brings together the \\"high technology\\" of the 1950s, these being plastics, electronics and cybernetics. The house has movable walls, shape-shifting components and an \\"electronic brain\\" allowing it to adjust to its inhabitants' needs, even to cooking meals, and to be configured according to their whims. It was created to satisfy a vision of housing for Everyman, similar to the Levittown ideal. However, the inventors were unable to interest any corporations in building the houses to sell at a price the average person could afford. The operation was taken over by a man named Moffat (the \\"M\\" in GML) who masterminded an operation which leased the houses to large companies to house their workers. Eventually the lease arrangements began to include shares in the client companies, so that GML came to own major interests in almost every company in the world, giving it effective control. In turn the GML house enabled companies to impose terms amounting to indentured servitude on their workers, the alternative being to live in a slum on public assistance. Lavin was cut out of GML business and his stock was impounded on a pretext. He died in poverty, but some time later a legal error allowed his children to regain control of the stock, whereupon Donald was kidnapped and brainwashed to prevent him from revealing where he had hidden the certificates. Reception Groff Conklin praised the novel as \\"a grimly unforgettable item that delivers an extra punch on a second reading.\\"\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, October 1955, p.110 ReferencesExternal links * *Gladiator- At-Law as serialized in Galaxy, parts 1, 2, and 3 at the Internet Archive Category:1955 American novels Category:1955 science fiction novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Novels by Frederik Pohl Category:Novels by Cyril M.

Hoffmeister's military service began in 1914 in the Imperial German army. During the 1930s, Hoffmeister was part of the 'Foreign Armies' () section of the German military and acted as liaison officer with the Soviet Union on the development of mechanised units. Colonel (Oberst) Hoffmeister, as commander of Infantry Regiment 21 of the German 17th Infantry Division, was scheduled to link up with a 131-man Brandenburger commando team during Operation Sea Lion (Unternehmen Seel√∂we) and push up the coast to Dover. Hoffmeister's division was to be part of the German 16th Army's area of operations. Operation Sea Lion was to have been launched in 1940 after the Fall of France, but it was abandoned in September of that same year. Promoted to Lieutenant-General (Generalleutnant), Hoffmeister commanded the German 383rd Infantry Division on the Eastern Front from 1 July 1943 to 20 June 1944, and on 6 October 1943, was awarded a Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Hoffmeister had just been promoted from command of the division to acting command of the formation of which it was a part, the XXXXI Panzer Corps (replacing Artillery General Helmuth Weidling), when it was destroyed in late June 1944. The 383rd Division was given the task of holding Babruysk against an overwhelming Soviet assault during Operation Bagration. Much of the remainder of XXXXI Panzer Corps was also destroyed, along with its parent formation, the Ninth Army. Hoffmeister was taken prisoner by Soviet forces of the 2nd Belorussian Front on 1 July during a breakout attempt from the encirclement at Babruysk. The front's report for 8 July quoted Hoffmeister as giving a bitter and expletive-laden diatribe against the \\"amateurs\\" (i.e. the Nazi regime and senior generals loyal to them) whom he held responsible for the military catastrophe.Soviet report in Russian MOD files, f.254, i.504, 9, pp. 113-115 Later in July, Hoffmeister made a radio broadcast from Moscow on behalf of the National Committee for a Free Germany, again attacking the Nazi regime in similar terms: > \\"The defeat in White Russia is not the only example of Hitler's ineptitude > as a commander. When Field Marshals von Leeb, List, von Rundstedt, von Bock > and von Brauchitsch, Colonel General Haider and many others attempted to > point out these mistakes Hitler dismissed them from their posts [...] The > newer generals, however, such as Rommel, Dietl, Schorner, Keitel and others > who had not gone through a long military schooling failed to perceive these > mistakes\\"\\"New Front\\", Time Magazine, July 31, 1944, at This represented something of a propaganda coup for the Soviets.

In quantum mechanics, the raising operator is sometimes called the creation operator, and the lowering operator the annihilation operator. Well-known applications of ladder operators in quantum mechanics are in the formalisms of the quantum harmonic oscillator and angular momentum. Introduction Another type of operator in quantum field theory, discovered in the early 1970s, is known as the anti-symmetric operator. This operator, similar to spin in non-relativistic quantum mechanics is a ladder operator that can create two fermions of opposite spin out of a boson or a boson from two fermions. A Fermion, named after Enrico Fermi, is a particle with a half- integer spin, such as electrons and protons. This is a matter particle. A boson, named after S. N. Bose, is a particle with full integer spin, such as photons and W's. This is a force carrying particle. Spin First, we will review spin for non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Spin, an intrinsic property similar to angular momentum, is defined by a spin operator S that plays a role on a system similar to the operator L for orbital angular momentum. The operators S^2 and S_z whose eigenvalues are S^2s,m\\\\rangle=s(s+1)\\\\hbar^2s,m\\\\rangle and S_zs,m\\\\rangle=m\\\\hbars,m\\\\rangle respectively. These formalisms also obey the usual commutation relations for angular momentum [S_x,S_y]=i\\\\hbar S_z, [S_y,S_z]=i\\\\hbar S_x, and [S_z,S_x]=i\\\\hbar S_y. The raising and lowering operators, S_{+} and S_{-}, are defined as S_{+}=S_x+i\\\\cdot S_y and S_{-}=S_x - i\\\\cdot S_y respectively. These ladder operators act on the state in the following S_+s,m\\\\rangle=\\\\hbar \\\\sqrt{s(s+1)-m(m+1)}s,m+1\\\\rangle and S_-s,m\\\\rangle=\\\\hbar \\\\sqrt{s(s+1)-m(m-1)}s,m-1\\\\rangle respectively. The operators S_x and S_y can be determined using the ladder method. In the case of the spin 1/2 case (fermion), the operator S_+ acting on a state produces S_++\\\\rangle=0 and S_+-\\\\rangle=\\\\hbar+\\\\rangle. Likewise, the operator S_- acting on a state produces S_--\\\\rangle=0 and S_-+\\\\rangle=\\\\hbar-\\\\rangle. The matrix representations of these operators are constructed as follows: : [S_+] = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\langle+S_++\\\\rangle & \\\\langle+S_+-\\\\rangle \\\\ \\\\langle-S_++\\\\rangle & \\\\langle-S_+-\\\\rangle \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\hbar \\\\cdot \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} : [S_-] = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\langle+S_-+\\\\rangle & \\\\langle+S_--\\\\rangle \\\\ \\\\langle-S_-+\\\\rangle & \\\\langle-S_--\\\\rangle \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\hbar \\\\cdot \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} Therefore, S_x and S_y can be represented by the matrix representations: :[S_x] = \\\\frac{ \\\\hbar}{2} \\\\cdot \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} :[S_y] = \\\\frac{ \\\\hbar}{2} \\\\cdot \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} Recalling the generalized uncertainty relation for two operators A and B, \\\\Delta_{\\\\psi} A \\\\, \\\\Delta_{\\\\psi} B \\\\ge \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\left[{A},{B}\\\\right]\\\\right\\\\rangle_\\\\psi\\\\right , we can immediately see that the uncertainty relation of the operators S_x and S_y are as follows: : \\\\Delta_{\\\\psi} S_x \\\\, \\\\Delta_{\\\\psi} S_y \\\\ge \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left\\\\left\\\\langle\\\\left[{S_x},{S_y}\\\\right]\\\\right\\\\rangle_\\\\psi\\\\right = \\\\frac{1}{2} (i \\\\hbar S_z) = \\\\frac{ \\\\hbar}{2} S_z Therefore, like orbital angular momentum, we can only specify one coordinate at a time. We specify the operators S^2 and S_z. Application in Quantum Field Theory The creation of a particle and anti-particle from a boson is defined similarly but for infinite dimensions. Therefore, the Levi-Civita symbol for infinite dimensions is introduced. :\\\\varepsilon_{ijk\\\\ell\\\\dots} = \\\\left{ \\\\begin{matrix} +1 & \\\\mbox{if }(i,j,k,\\\\ell,\\\\dots) \\\\mbox{ is an even permutation of } (1,2,3,4,\\\\dots) \\\\ -1 & \\\\mbox{if }(i,j,k,\\\\ell,\\\\dots) \\\\mbox{ is an odd permutation of } (1,2,3,4,\\\\dots) \\\\ 0 & \\\\mbox{if any two labels are the same} \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right. The commutation relations are simply carried over to infinite dimensions [S_i,S_j]=i\\\\hbar S_k\\\\varepsilon_{ijk}. S^2 is now equal to S^2=\\\\sum_{m=1}^n S_m^2 where n=‚àû. Its eigenvalue is S^2s,m>=s(s+1)\\\\hbar^2s,m> . Defining the magnetic quantum number, angular momentum projected in the z direction, is more challenging than the simple state of spin. The problem becomes analogous to moment of inertia in classical mechanics and is generalizable to n dimensions. It is this property that allows for the creation and annihilation of bosons. Bosons Characterized by their spin, a bosonic field can be scalar fields, vector fields and even tensor fields. To illustrate, the electromagnetic field quantized is the photon field, which can be quantized using conventional methods of canonical or path integral quantization. This has led to the theory of quantum electrodynamics, arguably the most successful theory in physics. The graviton field is the quantized gravitational field. There is yet to be a theory that quantizes the gravitational field, but theories such as string theory can be thought of the gravitational field quantized. An example of a non-relativistic bosonic field is that describing cold bosonic atoms, such as Helium-4. Free bosonic fields obey commutation relations: :[a_i,a_j]=[a^\\\\dagger_i,a^\\\\dagger_j]=0 :[a_i,a^\\\\dagger_i]=\\\\langle fg \\\\rangle, To illustrate, suppose we have a system of N bosons that occupy mutually orthogonal single-particle states \\\\phi_1\\\\rang, \\\\phi_2\\\\rang, \\\\phi_3\\\\rang , etc. Using the usual representation, we demonstrate the system by assigning a state to each particle and then imposing exchange symmetry. : \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\left[ \\\\phi_1\\\\rang \\\\phi_2\\\\rang \\\\phi_3\\\\rang + \\\\phi_2\\\\rang \\\\phi_1\\\\rang \\\\phi_3\\\\rang + \\\\phi_3\\\\rang \\\\phi_2\\\\rang \\\\phi_1\\\\rang \\\\right]. This wave equation can be represented using a second quantized approach, known as second quantization. The number of particles in each single-particle state is listed. : 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, \\\\cdots \\\\rangle, The creation and annihilation operators, which add and subtract particles from multi-particle states. These creation and annihilation operators are very similar to those defined for the quantum harmonic oscillator, which added and subtracted energy quanta. However, these operators literally create and annihilate particles with a given quantum state. The bosonic annihilation operator a_2 and creation operator a_2^\\\\dagger have the following effects: : a_2  N_1, N_2, N_3, \\\\cdots \\\\rangle = \\\\sqrt{N_2} \\\\mid N_1, (N_2 - 1), N_3, \\\\cdots \\\\rangle, : a_2^\\\\dagger  N_1, N_2, N_3, \\\\cdots \\\\rangle = \\\\sqrt{N_2 + 1} \\\\mid N_1, (N_2 + 1), N_3, \\\\cdots \\\\rangle. Like the creation and annihilation operators a_i and a_i^\\\\dagger also found in Quantum Field Theory, the creation and annihilation operators S_i^+ and S_i^- act on bosons in multi- particle states. While a_i and a_i^\\\\dagger allows us to determine whether a particle was created or destroyed in a system, the spin operators S_i^+ and S_i^- allow us to determine how. A photon can become both a positron and electron and vice versa. Because of the anti-symmetric statistics, a particle of spin \\\\frac{1}{2} obeys the Pauli-Exclusion Rule. Two particles can exist in the same state if and only if the spin of the particle is opposite. Back to our example, the spin state of the particle is spin-1. Symmetric particles, or bosons, need not obey the Pauli-Exclusion Principle so therefore we can represent the spin state of the particle as follows: : 1, ix, 0, 0, 0, \\\\cdots \\\\rangle, and 1, -ix, 0, 0, 0, \\\\cdots \\\\rangle, The annihilation spin operator, as its name implies, annihilates a photon into both an electron and positron. Likewise, the creation spin operator creates a photon. The photon can be in either the first state or the second state in this example. If we apply the linear momentum operator BosonizationFermions Therefore, we define the operator S_i + and S_i -. In the case of the non- relativistic particle, if S_+ is applied to a fermion twice, the resulting eigenvalue is 0. Similarly, the eigenvalue is 0 when S_- is applied to a fermion twice. This relation satisfies the Pauli Exclusion Principle. However, bosons are symmetric particles, which do not obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.

Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314 (1986), is a case decided by the United States Supreme Court. Background Randall Lamont Griffith, who is African American, was indicted for first-degree robbery in 1982 at the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, Kentucky. This Supreme Court decision concerned the retrospective application of judge-made rules. Specifically, the Court had to decide whether a prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges to exclude black jurors, combined with his call to the jury clerk, violated the black petitioner's right to an impartial jury. The Court was called upon to decide whether its previous decision in Batson v. Kentucky was applicable to litigation that was not yet final or that was pending on direct review (that is, on direct appeal rather than a collateral attack such as by petition for a writ of habeas corpus) when Batson was decided. Both Griffith and Batson concern trials in the same courthouse. Question Could retroactive Supreme Court decisions be applied selectively to cases pending direct review or not yet final? Holding The Court held that after a new rule had been decided in a particular case, \\"the integrity of judicial review requires that we apply that rule to all similar cases pending on direct review.\\" The Court reasoned that selective application of new rules violated the principle of treating similarly situated defendants on an equal basis. The Court also refused to make an exception to the rule of retroactivity in cases where there was a \\"clean break\\" with past precedent.

He then served for some years in rabbinical posts, after which he became principal of the Mizrachi Teachers Seminary (1917‚Äì21) and director of the Mizrachi Zionist organization (1921‚Äì24). In 1924 he joined the faculty of the Hebrew Theological College in Chicago, where he served as professor of Hebrew literature and philosophy until his retirement in 1955, also teaching at the College of Jewish Studies in Chicago. He moved to New York where he continued his literary and scholarly activities until his death. Works Waxman is best known for his six-volume tour-de-force A History of Jewish Literature (1960). This work contains a history of Jewish literature from the close of the Bible to the 1950s. The purposes of this history were to make accessible to the broader, literate public the results of Jewish scholarship and research over the past century into the various branches of Jewish literature, and to coordinate and correlate the scattered facts and voluminous data into one comprehensive whole in order to create a complete picture of the productivity of the Jewish genius over the ages. Waxman's method is to first describe the probable date of composition and country of origin. Following this, he gives a brief review of the book's major themes and writing style, as well as several excerpts from the book itself. \\"A History of Jewish Literature\\" covers the whole spectrum of Jewish Literature, including Rabbinics, Poetry, Belles-lettres, Philosophy, History, Biblical Exegesis, etc. The only comparable work is Israel Zinberg's \\"Die Geschichte fun der Literatur bei Yidn\\" written in Yiddish (1972, 12 vols) but with an English title identical to that of Waxman's opus (\\"History of Jewish Literature\\"). Waxman also published hundreds of articles in Hebrew, Yiddish, and English. Many of his articles were collected in volumes of essays, \\"Ketavim Nivharim\\" (2 vols., 1943‚Äì44), \\"Galut u-Ge'ullah\\" (1952), and Moreh ha-Dorot (1963). He wrote studies on the history of Jewish philosophy, including \\"The Philosophy of Don Hasdai Crescas\\" (c.1920) and a translation, with introduction, of Moses Hess' Rome and Jerusalem (1945).

The Shanghai Russians were a sizable Russian diaspora that flourished in Shanghai, China between the World Wars. By 1937 it is estimated that there were as many as 25,000 Russians living in the city, the largest European group by far. Most of them had come from the Russian Far East, where, with the support of the Japanese, the Whites had maintained a presence as late as the autumn of 1922.  Background  In the late 19th century, the Russian imperial government was shifting the focus of its investment to northeast China. It developed the Chinese Eastern Railway first in Heilongjiang linking Harbin to Vladivostok, and later to Port Arthur on the Liaodong Peninsula. As a consequence, China's trade with its northern neighbour soared. As soon as there was a regular ferry service between Vladivostok and Shanghai, the Russian tea merchants started to settle in the commercial capital of China. About 350 Russian citizens resided within the Shanghai International Settlement in 1905. In order to protect their interests, the Russian consulate was opened in 1896. The old building of the consulate, still occupied by the Russian diplomats, ranks among the Bund's minor landmarks. The bulk of the Russian exile community relocated to Shanghai from Vladivostok following the fall of the Provisional Priamurye Government at the close of the Russian Civil War. Admiral Oskar Victorovich Stark's squadron alone brought several thousand White Russians from Vladivostok in 1922. Many Harbin Russians, attracted by the booming economy of Shanghai, moved to the Shanghai International Settlement over the following years. Barred by both distance and money from joining established communities in Paris and Berlin, a large number gravitated towards Shanghai, a freeport at the time, requiring no visa or work-permit for entry. For this same reason it was later to become a refuge for Jews fleeing the Nazis. A group of Russian √©migr√©s arriving in Shanghai. A photograph from the newspaper Shankhaiskaya zarya, 23 February 1930.  Living conditions  Although free, and relatively secure, conditions for the √©migr√©s were far from ideal. For one thing they were all stateless, as the Soviet government had revoked the citizenship of all political exiles in 1921. The only travel document most of them had was the Nansen passport, issued by the League of Nations. Unlike other foreigners in China they did not have the benefits conferred by extraterritoriality, which granted immunity from local laws. If arrested, they would be tried under Chinese law.https://www.rbth.com/arts/2015/09/18/russian_noon_a_look_at_white_emigre_life_in_1930s_shanghai_49337.html This was made worse by the barriers to employment opportunities, which in this international city required a good command of English or French as a minimum requirement. There were whole families that depended on wives or daughters who made a living as taxi dancers (hired dancing partners). A survey by the League of Nations in 1935 reportedly found that some 22% of Shanghai Russian women between 16 and 45 years of age were engaging in prostitution to some extent.Port of last resort : the diaspora communities of Shanghai, by Marcia Reynders Ristaino, Stanford University Press, 2001, page 94 Some did find professional work, teaching music or French. Other women took work as dressmakers, shop assistants and hairdressers. Many men became career soldiers of the Shanghai Russian Regiment, the only professional/standing unit within the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M-d_DwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA63&lpg;=PA63&dq;=Shanghai+Russians&source;=bl&ots;=hcWFE86u7G&sig;=ACfU3U0RnPXue- bDD5QrHaBjgkF- aI0T2A&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjn7aOy6qzqAhXVQUEAHSD_ArM4ChDoATAEegQIARAB#v=onepage&q;=Shanghai%20Russians&f;=false By slow degrees, and despite the many difficulties, the community not only retained a good deal of cohesion but did begin to flourish, both economically and culturally. By the mid-1930s there were two Russian schools, as well as a variety of cultural and sporting clubs. There were Russian-language newspapers and a radio station. An important part was also played by the local Russian Orthodox Church under the guidance of St. John of Shanghai and San Francisco. The cover of Vladimir Zhiganov's album The Russians in Shanghai (1936) Many exiles set up restaurants in the district known as Little Russia (around the Avenue Joffre, now Middle Huaihai Road, in the French Concession), contributing to the development of the local Western-style Haipai cuisine. Russian musicians (such as Oleg Lundstrem) achieved a dominance over the city's foreign-run orchestra. The most famous Russian singer, Alexander Vertinsky, relocated from Paris to Shanghai; and Fyodor Chaliapin was seen on tour. Vladimir Tretchikoff, the \\"King of Kitsch\\", spent his youth in the city. Russian teachers offered lessons in theatre and dancing. Margot Fonteyn, the English ballerina, studied dance in Shanghai as a child with Russian masters, one of whom, George Gontcharov, had formerly danced with the Bolshoi in Moscow.https://www.rbth.com/arts/2015/09/18/russian_noon_a_look_at_white_emigre_life_in_1930s_shanghai_49337.html But it was the contribution that Russian women made to the entertainment industry, dancing and otherwise, that gave the city its exotic reputation, noted in the guidebooks of the day. A fictionalized portrayal of their predicament is presented in the James Ivory film The White Countess (2005). Those who were left became the focus of earnest campaigns by the League of Nations and others to end the \\"white slave trade.\\" Pushkin monument in Shanghai  During the Japanese occupation  The Japanese formed a bureau for the Russian emigrees; it provided identification papers necessary to live, work and travel. The Shanghai Russians were left to choose between a Soviet citizenship or to remain stateless by support of the bureau. The stateless Russians were officially favoured by the regime, but in reality, they were not trusted and exposed to a great risk of being arrested as spies for the Soviet Union. They were also often enlisted in the army for work along the border with the Soviet Union. After 1941, when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union parted, they were in an even more sensitive situation. To separate the anti- Soviet Russians from the Soviet Russians, the former were ordered to wear a badge with the colours of the Czar ‚Äî later a white numbered disk of aluminium.

They were forced to flee, first to a refugee camp on the island of Tubabao in the Philippines and then mainly to the United States and Australia; however, many settled in Hong Kong. The Russian monuments of Shanghai did not escape the ravages of the Cultural Revolution. The Pushkin statue, funded by public subscription and unveiled on the centenary of the poet's death, was smashed by the Red Guards in 1966. It was subsequently restored in 1987. The Orthodox Cathedral of St. Nicholas, consecrated and elaborately frescoed in 1933, was converted into a washing machine factory, and subsequently a restaurant. The municipal government terminated the lease of the cathedral to the restaurant in 2004. The building became a bookshop in 2019.http://www.shanghai.gov.cn/shanghai/n46669/n48081/n48088/u22ai127179.html In the 1967 British film A Countess from Hong Kong, written and directed by Charlie Chaplin, Sophia Loren plays the only child of Russian aristocrats who escaped, during the Russian Revolution, to Shanghai, where she subsequently was born.

Service history The British ships Ruby, Captain Michael John Everitt, (or Eolus), 32, and the sloop , 18, were cruising off Hayti, when on 2 June 1779, in the Bay of Gonave, they fell in with the 36-gun French frigate , Captain d'Escars. Ruby chased Prudente for some hours and was much annoyed by the well-directed fire of the enemy's stern-chasers, by which Captain Everitt and a sailor lost their lives. When within easy range of Prudente, at about sunset, Ruby compelled her to strike, with the loss of two killed and three wounded. The British Navy took Prudente into service under the same name. HMS Ruby (Capt Stanhope) Britain at the Cape, Brenthurst Press 1992 sailed with the first squadron (under Capt John Blankett) to take part in the 1st British Occupation of the Cape, leaving England on 27 February 1795. There she was used on patrols and general duties but saw no action. The Battle of Muizenberg on 7 August 1795 triggered the collapse of the Dutch forces which controlled the Cape of Good Hope at the time.The First British Occupation of the Cape, TD Potgieter, Castle Military Museum, 1997. Representation of the Distressed Situation of His Majesty's Ships Ruby, Hector, Berwick and Bristol when Dismasted in the Great Hurricane, 6 October 1780 On the 25th June, 1807, Tsar Alexander I and Napoleon entered an accord at Tilsit, one of the secret clauses of which entailed the joint seizure of the Portuguese fleet. This led Napoleon to send a large army into Portugal in October of 1807, with a demand that Portugal should detain all British ships and sequester British property. This led to the departure of a Naval Squadron under Sir Sidney Smith to blockade the Tagus estuary. The squadron consisted of the Hibernia (120 guns), the London (98), the Foudroyant (80) and Elizabeth, Conqueror, Marlborough, Monarch, Plantagenet and Bedford (all78s). On arrival Smith arranged for the Portuguese Royal Family, all the serviceable Portuguese fleet and 20 armed merchantmen to leave for Brazil, which they did on the 29th October. Smith and his squadron accompanied them part of the way, leaving Marlborough, London, Monarch and Bedford to escort the fleet to Brazil. On the 30th October a Russian squadron under Admiral Seniavin entered Lisbon, where they became blockaded by the return of Smith's squadron. A few days after the Tsar's hostile declaration became known in London, five ships left Portsmouth to reinforce the blockade. These were the Ganges Defence and Alfred (74s) and Ruby and Agamemnon (64s). On arrival at the Tagus they enabled the Foudroyant, Conqueror and Plantagenet to leave for Cadiz. <\\"The Victory of Seapower\\", Caxton Pictorial Histories, p. 156-7> The blockade continued for some time, as evidenced by this extract from a letter written by a seaman, John Williams, on board HMS Ruby off Lisbon in June 1808 : \\"We are at present at anchor at the mouth of the harbour in sight of our Enemies. We are in sight of all of their Shipping with a naked eye there is of them 13 Saile of the Line of Battle Ships & 25 Sloops and Brigs of War all the Gun Boats we do not know the number of them.

Distribution Riekoperla darlingtoni is found on Mount Donna Buang, a mountain peak in the Victorian Central Highlands which lies in one of the oldest and highest areas of dissected Palaeozoic rocks (formed approximately ) in the Central Highlands of Victoria. The area is also popular tourist attraction throughout the year and the summit is a Scenic Reserve. Habitat The area providing habitat for Riekoperla darlingtoni supports tall sclerophyll forest dominated by alpine ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) with myrtle beech (Nothofagus cunninghamii) as a dominant understory tree species. The surrounding forest is dominated by mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans). It apparently occurs only in the area within of the summit of Mount Donna Buang, particularly on the southern slopes and is restricted to the small temporary streams which flow through forest dominated by alpine ash. The adult stonefly lives within rolled pieces of alpine ash bark suspended in low vegetation along natural drainage courses and in the vicinity of streams. The aquatic nymphs live under stones and in silty gravel in the drainage lines. Of particular scientific interest is the species' ability to survive the annual drying of its habitat, both in the egg stage and by burrowing down to a damper level and its seasonal flexibility in growth and emergence times, which enhances survival during the extremes of climate experienced on mountain tops. The species has not been discovered in other similar areas despite deliberate searches. Relatives The small brown, wingless stonefly, is one of the only two wingless stoneflies in Australia, and the species was first collected by Darlington in 1931 from the Mount Donna Buang area. A distinguishing feature of the species is its long antennae (up to 100% of its body length). Threats The Mount Donna Buang Wingless Stonefly has a very small home range thought to be only 2-4km, this area is protected within the Yarra Ranges National Park but threats still remain. Fuel or herbacide spillages, changes in hydrology and a proposed Mountain Bike Track called the Warburton Mountain Bike Destination directly threaten Mount Donna Buang Stonefly. The Mount Donna Buang Stonefly has recently been reassessed as Critically Endangered under the Victorian State legislation the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988.

History=Beginning Locomotive in Puerto Madryn, 1888. Locomotive and workers in Torre Jos√©, c. 1900. Railway bridge in Rawson, 1920s. Locomotive at Rawson, 1923. Gaiman station, c. 1920. Boca de la Zanja station, c. 1930. In 1884 the Argentine government granted the Welsh immigrant Lewis Jones a concession to build and operate a railway between the valley of the Chubut River and Porth Madryn on the southern side of the Pen√≠nsula Vald√©s. With the help of Asahel P. Bell, an engineer, Jones set up a company in Liverpool, England to finance the construction. In October 1884, Law No. 1539 that allowed company to build the line, was promulgated. Works began in 1886, directed by engineer Jones Williams, in both cities simultaneously, Puerto Madryn and Trelew. Apart of the local workers, several groups of immigrant were brought from Italy, Spain, Syria, Wales among other countries on the Vesta ship. On 11 November 1888, a line 70 km long between Trelew and the quay in Puerto Madryn was opened. It included the first telephone line of the region. Journey time (that were made on horseback) reduced from 20 hours to only 2 hours in train. From Trelew the line was extended 50 km to Gaiman on 31 December 1908 and from there to Dolavon on 12 October 1915. In 1910 a 450-mt. length dock was opened in Puerto Madryn. The railway station would be opened three years after. Nationalisation In 1920 the company was nationalised, being added to Ferrocarriles Patag√≥nicos of Argentine State Railway network. Soon after, the railway extended its tracks to Las Plumas. CCR's track gauge was converted to in 1922, and later the line was extended from Dolavon to Las Plumas. In 1923 the branch to Rawson and Playa Uni√≥n was built. In 1945 another branch from Las Chapas to Florentino Ameghino levee was opened. That branch was used to carry cement from Comodoro Rivadavia, moving around 1,500 ton per month. A project to extend the railway from Las Plumas to Paso de Indios was never carried out. The Government alleged technical issues for that decision. The dismissed project included to extend the CCR line to Trevelin and Esquel (to make a connection with La Trochita to Ingeniero Jacobacci) and then with Comodoro Rivadavia Railway to reach the city of Comodoro Rivadavia as well. It was also expected that the Government acquired diesel locomotives and built a broad gauge line from Puerto Madryn to Sierra Grande, connecting with the Nahuel Huapi railway in San Antonio Oeste. Other plans foresaw to use bus services to help railway lines. According to Clement Dumrauf, the railway was not expanded due to British settlers that were interested in preserve the Patagonia region only for sheep farming. Another version stated that livestock company \\"La Argentina Southern Land Company\\" refused to the construction of a line when they realised about the poor quality of the soil, which would be used to finance the construction. With the railway Nationalisation in Argentina of 1948, the CCR became part of Roca Railway, one of the six divisions of state-owned company Ferrocarriles Argentinos. A report made in 1949 stated that the CCR carried less than half of the number of passengers that the Comodoro Rivadavia Railway did and the same cargo as the Puerto Deseado Railway. The company reached its peak in 1948 with 197,936 passengers carried. It decreased to 161,805 one year later due to a Chubut River flood that interrupted services from July to August. In 1950 the Argentine state acquired a railcar for the Trelew-Rawson line and built 17 houses for workers in Puerto Madryn and 8 in Trelew. The Government also renewed rail tracks and the Puerto Madryn dock's floor. Decline and closure As the railway line had been constructed in narrow gauge (1,000 mm while being Welsh-owned, then changed to 750 mm when it became state-owned), the CRR could not be connected with the rest of Argentine railway network. A 1960 report declared operating costs of A$ 42,876,527.00 and only $7,867,092 of revenue. In 1956 trains carried 70,931 tons, decreasing to 29,339 four years later, due to strong competition with road transport. The line was finally closed in 1958 during Arturo Frondizi's administration. Three years later, part of the rolling stock was sold as spare while the other part was transferred to La Trochita. There was a project to re-open the line in 1964, although it was strongly resisted by local bus companies. While rail tracks were untouched and the rolling stock stored at warehouses in Trelew, 15 coaches were destroyed by fire, which caused the project to be suspended indefinitely. Rail tracks were finally dismantled between 1969 and 1974. Nevertheless, by 1975 some rolling stock was still preserved, such as three Henschel & Son locomotives and some cargo wagons. After the closure, some station buildings were used for other activities, such as Trelew and Puerto Madryn (serving as bus terminus). The former station buildings at Trelew and Gaiman are museums nowadays. while Playa Uni√≥n station is used as a police station.

However, they are more closely related to the genera they parasitize than to each other, and Rossomyrmex is more closely related to Cataglyphis than to Polyergus. Parasite‚Äìhost pairs Each parasite species has a single host from the genus Proformica, thus forming unique coevolving pairs: *Rossomyrmex proformicarum‚ÄìProformica epinotalis *Rossomyrmex quandratinodum‚ÄìProformica sp. *Rossomyrmex anatolicus‚ÄìProformica korbi *Rossomyrmex minuchae‚ÄìProformica longiseta Raids Parasitized nests need to replenish the host workers periodically, and this is done by raiding. The standard process is that after finding a new host nest to invade, the parasite worker marks the way to its nest with pheromones, and afterward fellow slave-makers begin to attract in a few seconds. Then they go quickly to the targeted host nest, attack it, and carry as many larvae and pupae as possible and return to their nest following the same trail marked by the pheromone. Workers of the attacked nest can fight or flee although, in Proformica, the most common behavior is flight probably because hosts always lose fights. Rossomyrmex is the only reported slave-maker that exclusively uses adult transport and single recruitment chain instead of pheromones during raids. This behavior is probably constrained by the arid habitat: raids take place in early summer when soil surface temperature can reach up to 30 ¬∞C, a temperature for which pheromones would quickly evaporate. This condition imposes that Rossomyrmex raids appear as less efficient than those carried out with pheromones; this, together with the usually flee behavior of the Proformica hosts permits the survival of several attacked nests. Finally, another important difference in the raiding behavior of Rossomyrmex is that the return to the parasite nest with the robbed brood takes place on the following day of the assault instead of later in the same day. Reproduction The reproductive behavior of slave-making ants usually consists in synchronous emergence of sexuals followed by a nuptial flight and the invasion of a host nest, but also in some cases females display a mating call around the natal nest to attract males and immediately after mating search for a host nest to usurp. However, the reproductive strategy of Rossomyrmex greatly differs from the one described above. Males and females emerge from the natal nest at a different time during the day and males always fly away short after their emergence. Virgin females of Rossomyrmex show a typical mating call behavior near the natal nest but due to the scarce number of nests and that sexuals are not produced every year in all nests, some females remain virgin and cannot produce new nests despite performing sexual calling chorus for several days. When a male arrives at a female-calling nest, he will mate to as many females as possible, being one of the few cases known of polygamous males in ants, especially when mating occurs out of the nest. In contrast, females are strictly monandrous although there are some reported cases of multiply mated queens. Females recently mated always run to hide in their natal nest after the first copulation and do not seek for subsequent mating. This reproductive behavior seems to be constrained by the low production of sexuals, especially males (which gives advantage to female- calling behavior rather than nuptial flights and multiple mating by males). Newly mated queens search for a host nest to invade and they are unchallenged by host workers and queens thanks to the repellent effect of the Dufour's gland that they have highly inflated before the usurpation. After taking over the host nest by killing the resident queens, the size of this gland decreases. This strategy to invade a host nest contrasts with other extended strategy consisting in newly mated queens embarking in a slave raid with workers, which would facilitate the penetration of the host nest immersed in chaos. In the Proformica-Rossomyrmex system, dispersal ability is quite different for host and parasite species. Proformica is generally polygynous (multiple queen colonies) with wingless queens that found new nests by budding; therefore they are likely to show restricted dispersal and strong population structure, while Rossomyrmex is monogynous (single queen colonies), with both sexes winged and show independent colony founding.

It is a wingless bush cricket, with the body size of up to , which makes it one of the largest European insects and one of the world's largest Orthoptera (grasshoppers, crickets and alike). Colloquially known as the predatory bush cricket, or the spiked magician (due to the \\"enchanting\\" manner in which it waves its forelimbs as it approaches its prey),Blondel, J., Aronson, J., Bodiou, J-Y. and Boeuf, G. (2010) The Mediterranean Region. Biological Diversity in Space and Time. Third Edition. Oxford University Press, Oxford it is uncommon among its kind due to its carnivorous lifestyle, most often preying on smaller insects, with a known tendency towards cannibalism as well. For this purpose, it has strong fore and mid legs, equipped with sharp spines. When these animals are hunting, they move about, catching their prey by suddenly leaping on them and grabbing them with their legs. Their prey is usually killed by biting into the throat, and eating is done at capture. Saga pedo is active at dusk and during nighttime, with activity slowly expanding through the day at the end of the season.  Life cycle  The female attains sexual maturity three to four weeks after hatching and starts laying eggs. A single egg is deposited by stabbing the long, sharp ovipositor into the soil at a suitable site. The female will lay from twenty five to eighty eggs. Development depends largely on the ambient temperature. At or more, the eggs start to develop immediately, the nymphs hatching after approximately 40 to 85 days (again depending on the temperature). At colder conditions, the eggs enter diapause, which is a delay in development and can result in the eggs remaining buried for up to five years (mostly two to three). After hatching, which occurs around May, the nymphs go through six or seven instars before attaining sexual maturity, and live for four to six months after that. Saga pedo is also uncommon in that it mostly reproduces asexually, with parthenogenesis. The population therefore appears to consist solely of females and there is no reliable record of a male of this species. They also have the largest number of chromosomes among members of the genus Saga - 68 - and are probably tetraploid.  Ecology and distribution  Adults are eaten by birds, insectivores, rodents, lizards, frogs, and toads. Nymphs are eaten by spiders, scorpions, centipedes, and preying insects. Saga species inhabit both dry and wet meadows, pastures, shrub by hillsides, gorges, and as well follow grain fields and vineyards in southern Europe and western Asia from the Iberian peninsula across central Europe and central Asia to China. Like other Saga species, S. pedo is comfortable with adverse weather conditions, and can be found in habitats from sea level to altitudes up to about 1500 m, and occasionally higher. The southernmost known locality is Sicily, while the northernmost is in Kurgan Oblast, Russia, at latitude 54¬∫30' N. Its range is vast, but the population is spread thinly, threatened by insecticide use and habitat destruction. Therefore, the species is considered vulnerable at a global scale. Saga pedo was reported as an accidental introduction from Europe into Tompkins Township, Jackson County, Michigan (USA) in 1970. In all, only six specimens were found from 1970 to 1972, during August and September. None have been found since by a reliable authority, so they are considered extirpated from North America. There have been occasional unconfirmed sightings in subsequent decades, and catching of several specimens in Michigan from 2004 on were reported by a local high school teacher in the New York Biology Teachers Association's publication, however, this remains to be confirmed by a scholarly source.

The committee has urged the Dutch government to offer help to ex-Muslims in exile. Ehsan Jami (Labour Party) and Loubna Berrada (People's Party for Freedom and Democracy), founded the committee in 2007, with the help of several advisors and other former Muslims and critics of Islam.

Committee for Ex-Muslims founded, stream of reactions from society, NU.nl, 2 June 2007. During the broadcast, Jami announced a wish to offer a helping hand to Muslims who want to abandon their religion since Islamic society does not allow apostasy. Jami pointed out abandoning Islam is an option in most Muslim societies, as long as it is not spoken out and one continues to act as though one is still a believer. Open apostasy in Islamic societies, Jami explained, leads to expulsion and death threats - a manner of conduct he strongly opposes. Later that week, Jami appeared on Dutch television show 'Schepper & Co' defending his remarks by pointing out he, as a politician, has the duty to verbalise worries that exist in society, thereby making full use of Dutch society's freedom of speech.

Life Born in Hampstead, London on 24 January 1864, to parents Samuel Harraden and Rosalie Lindstedt Harraden, Beatrice Harraden grew up to become an influential feminist writer and suffragette. She studied at Cheltenham Ladies‚Äô College in Gloucestershire, as well as at Queen‚Äôs College and Bedford College in London. In 1883, she received her BA degree as well as an honors degree in Classics and Mathematics, which would have been a noteworthy feat for a woman in this era. Harraden was both a leader of the suffragette movement and a founding member of the Women‚Äôs Social and Political Union (WSPU), befriending new members like Helen Craggs, and she was also an integral member of the Women Writers' Suffrage League and Women‚Äôs Tax Resistance League. Unlike the WSPU, who only welcomed women as members, the Women Writers Suffrage League welcomed men, women and members from diverse political parties. The only dictate for membership to the Writer‚Äôs League, other than having been paid for a literary work, was support of the suffragette cause. These writers were agitators demanding access to the male dominated civic and social institutions, but they used their pens to influence society‚Äôs social scene and the theatre. Harraden therefore turned to this group as the WSPU became increasingly militant and exclusive. She published her work in the suffragette paper Votes for Women and traveled extensively in Europe and the United States due to her involvement in the women‚Äôs movement. This included Holiday Campaigns in the Lake District for Liverpool WSPU organiser Alice Davies, which she took part in with the Australian suffragette Vida Goldstein. She also involved herself as a reader for the Oxford English Dictionary, and this, too is reflected in her fiction: The Scholar‚Äôs Daughter (1906) is set among lexicographers. Harraden spent several summer holidays lodging at The Green Dragon inn at Little Stretton, Shropshire, walking and writing. Her memories of this and the landlady, a Mrs Benbow, led to her writing a short story, At the Green Dragon, published in 1894. Her early works include Little Rosebud: Or, Things Will Take a Turn (1891), as well as Ships That Pass in the Night (1893), a best-seller which sold over one million copies. The love story set in a tuberculosis sanatorium, follows protagonist, Bernadine, an independent teacher, writer and activist, who falls in love with Robert, the Disagreeable man. After recovering and leaving the sanatorium, Bernadine returns to England. The popular novel ends rather tragically with Bernadine dying suddenly in a traffic accident. Though Harraden continued her career as a writer, she failed to achieve similar success with subsequent books which included novels, short stories and books for children. In 1930, she received a Civil List pension for her literary work. She died at Barton-on-Sea on Monday 5 May 1936.  Works  Harraden's commitment to the women‚Äôs rights movement can be seen throughout her writing. Many of her works‚Äîif not directly referencing the suffragette cause‚Äîinclude themes of gender dynamics, male/female power struggles, and address ‚Äúthe alienation of the individual in the modern world‚Äù. Harraden‚Äôs female characters are strong, independent, and highly intelligent and yet remain maternal and sympathetic; her heroines are not afraid to express emotions that may have been considered ‚Äúwomanly‚Äù or weak at this time. In her Hilda Strafford (1897), the protagonist, Hilda, moves to California to marry Robert Strafford, a farmer. After a storm in which much of the farm is destroyed, Hilda tries to comfort the distraught Robert. Robert is inconsolable and, yet Hilda proceeds to tell him she is no longer happy merely being a ‚Äúsettler‚Äôs wife.‚Äù Robert dies of the shock of this news. When Hilda turns to her friend Ben for comfort, he views her as cold and unfeeling and blames her for Robert‚Äôs death. The protagonist Hilda, is characterized as harsh and bitter by the men around her just because of her desire for independence ---an unexpected and formidable trait in a woman in this era. Her play Lady Geraldine‚Äôs Speech, first published in the Women‚Äôs Social and Political Union newspaper ‚ÄòVotes for Women‚Äô in 1909, looks at protagonist, Lady Geraldine, a wealthy socialite who comprehends little about the suffragette cause, and yet is an anti-suffragette. In the play, Lady Geraldine, has agreed to make a speech at an anti-suffrage meeting, but quickly realizes she has little information about the issue and needs a ghostwriter to help develop her argument. Lady Geraldine turns to her old-friend Dr. Alice Romney, a pro- suffragette progressive to help her construct her speech. Throughout the course of the play, Romney's suffragette friends continually arrive at the house for their own meeting. The characters include a famous pianist, a famous artist, a literature professor, a typist, and a maid. Lady Geraldine actually begins to admire these independent, intelligent, and driven women as they all pitch in to help her with her speech. Harraden humorously summarizes the flawed arguments of the anti-suffragist with Romney finishing Geraldine‚Äôs speech by telling her to stress the ‚Äúdegradation of Womanhood. Degradation and disintegration of entire Empire... Emphatic, nay passionate, insistence on your own brainlessness-that is very important.\\" Harraden even cites Shakespeare‚Äôs writings and his strong, independent female characters to suggest he would support the suffragette cause. As the character, Professor Miller, in Lady Geraldine's Speech, lists Portia, Hermione, Cordelia, Rosalind, Beatrice, and Imogen all as \\"women of brain, education, and initiative\\" that the suffragettes model themselves after. The play concludes with Geraldine throwing her speech into the fire and deciding she needs further study of the suffrage movement before she settles on her beliefs. Lady Geraldine‚Äôs Speech provides an exceptional example of Harraden‚Äôs ability to use her quick-witted dialogue and intellect to expose the ignorance of anti- suffragists arguments. She emphasizes the positive aspects of suffragette women and focuses on their intellect, as well as their acceptance of others as can be seen in Lady Geraldine's Speech‚Äîupon meeting an anti-suffragist, the suffragettes, rather than berating her for her ideals, instead choose to help her with her speech and tell her their own personal reasons for joining the suffrage movement.  Theatre in the British women's suffrage movement  As a writer for the suffrage movement at this time, Harraden capitalized on the similarities ‚Äúbetween the stage and the public speaking platform to encourage women to raise their voices in a public forum‚Äù. As seen in Harraden‚Äôs Lady Geraldine‚Äôs Speech, the women‚Äôs movement in Britain in this period used the theatre as a forum for suffrage speeches and conversely used suffrage meetings as a place for theatre, creating a new form of political drama. Famous actress, writer, and journalist during the time, Cicely Hamilton, said in an interview that suffragists \\"had started a new system of propaganda by means of plays, that was so successful that everybody was trying to steal the plays or imitate them in some way.\\" Many of these suffrage-era propagandistic productions hoped to encourage actual audience members to join the cause and challenged them to take action on what they witnessed. However, suffrage playwrights had to have an acute awareness that ‚Äúpublic speaking platforms defied nineteenth-century notions of women's decorum, modesty, and submissiveness and marked them as aggressive and unfeminine‚Äù. In this case, as they called for women to speak up for their right to vote, they also had to address the challenges women faced in speaking in any public setting. The playwrights used the theatrical forum to help women overcome their lack of practice and, hence, nervousness about public speaking; suffrage playwrights were able to employ highly-trained and renowned actresses to speak eloquently on behalf of their cause. In fact, as the suffragette writers were fighting to have a public voice and a venue to be heard, they also struggled to find their public voice. Though these plays may have been well-received by suffrage supporters, the average theatre goers and theatre reviewers at this time often dismissed these plays viewing them as ‚Äúpropaganda rather than art.‚Äù Suffrage playwrights not only used the stage as a platform to promote their political agenda, but also to combat pervasive ideas of femininity. These playwrights were tasked with making powerful, independent, intelligent women seem ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and unthreatening. They attempted to show how women with agency could function in society without the ‚Äúdisintegration of the empire‚Äù as a whole‚Äîwhich was a common anti-suffrage argument. They used their platform to depict women as more than overly emotional, child-bearing entities and instead place them in alternative societal roles. If they were to gain the sympathy of anti-suffrage women and not risk alienating the men with the power to give them the right to vote, they had to cleverly gain support and empathy for their cause.

A diagram of Admiral Howe is sitting at a table in the town, out of sight of his flagship, with his brother General Howe On 7 September 1776, the experimental American submarine , under the guidance of army volunteer Sergeant Ezra Lee, was alleged to have attacked HMS Eagle, which was moored off what is today called Liberty Island, but was unable to bore through the hull. When Lee attempted another spot in the hull, he lost the ship, and eventually abandoned the attempt. British naval historian Richard Compton-Hall stated that the problems of achieving neutral buoyancy would have rendered the vertical propeller useless. The route Turtle would have had to take to attack HMS Eagle was slightly across the tidal stream which would, in all probability, have resulted in Ezra Lee becoming exhausted having only 20 minutes of air. There is no record of the Royal Navy recording an attack.Compton-Hall, pp. 32‚Äì40 In the face of these and other problems Compton-Hall suggests that the Turtle got nowhere near HMS Eagle and the entire story was fabricated as disinformation and morale-boosting propaganda, and that if Ezra Lee did carry out an attack it was in a covered rowing boat rather than Turtle. Eagle went on to take part in the Battle of Cuddalore in 1783.Winfield 2007, p. 105 Eagle was on harbour service from 1790, and was broken up in 1812.

As IPv4 and IPv6 networks are not directly interoperable, transition technologies are designed to permit hosts on either network type to communicate with any other host. To meet its technical criteria, IPv6 must have a straightforward transition plan from the current IPv4.RFC 1726 - IPng Technical Criteria The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) conducts working groups and discussions through the IETF Internet Drafts and Requests for Comments processes to develop these transition technologies towards that goal. Some basic IPv6 transition mechanisms are defined in RFC 4213. Stateless IP/ICMP Translation Stateless IP/ICMP Translation (SIIT) translates between the packet header formats in IPv6 and IPv4. The SIIT method defines a class of IPv6 addresses called IPv4-translated addresses. They have the prefix and may be written as , in which the IPv4 formatted address refers to an IPv6-enabled node. The prefix was chosen to yield a zero-valued checksum to avoid changes to the transport protocol header checksum. The algorithm can be used in a solution that allows IPv6 hosts that do not have a permanently assigned IPv4 address to communicate with IPv4-only hosts. Address assignment and routing details are not addressed by the specification. SIIT can be viewed as a special case of stateless network address translation. The specification is a product of the NGTRANS IETF working group, and was initially drafted in February 2000 by E. Nordmark of Sun Microsystems. It was revised in 2011, and in 2016 its current revision was published. Tunnel broker A tunnel broker provides IPv6 connectivity by encapsulating IPv6 traffic in IPv4 Internet transit links, typically using 6in4. This establishes IPv6 tunnels within the IPv4 Internet. The tunnels may be managed with the Tunnel Setup Protocol (TSP) or AYIYA.RFC:3053 6rd 6rd is a mechanism to facilitate rapid deployment of the IPv6 service across IPv4 infrastructures of Internet service providers (ISPs). It uses stateless address mappings between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and transmits IPv6 packets across automatic tunnels that follow the same optimized routes between customer nodes as IPv4 packets. It was used for an early large deployment of an IPv6 service with native addresses during 2007 (RFC 5569RFC 5569 IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (6rd)). The standard-track specification of the protocol is in RFC 5969.RFC 5969 IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (6rd) -- Protocol Specification Transport Relay Translation RFC 3142 defines the Transport Relay Translation (TRT) method. TRT employs DNS translation between AAAA and A records known as DNS-ALG as defined in RFC 2694. NAT64 NAT64 and DNS64. NAT64 is a mechanism to allow IPv6 hosts to communicate with IPv4 servers. The NAT64 server is the endpoint for at least one IPv4 address and an IPv6 network segment of 32-bits, e.g., 64:ff9b::/96 (RFC 6052, RFC 6146). The IPv6 client embeds the IPv4 address with which it wishes to communicate using these bits, and sends its packets to the resulting address. The NAT64 server then creates a NAT-mapping between the IPv6 and the IPv4 address, allowing them to communicate.RFC 6146 Stateful NAT64: Network Address and Protocol Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers DNS64 DNS64 describes a DNS server that when asked for a domain's AAAA records, but only finds A records, synthesizes the AAAA records from the A records. The first part of the synthesized IPv6 address points to an IPv6/IPv4 translator and the second part embeds the IPv4 address from the A record. The translator in question is usually a NAT64 server. The standard- track specification of DNS64 is in RFC 6147.RFC 6147 DNS64: DNS Extensions for Network Address Translation from IPv6 Clients to IPv4 Servers There are two noticeable issues with this transition mechanism: *It only works for cases where DNS is used to find the remote host address, if IPv4 literals are used the DNS64 server will never be involved. *Because the DNS64 server needs to return records not specified by the domain owner, DNSSEC validation against the root will fail in cases where the DNS server doing the translation is not the domain owner's server. ISATAP ISATAP (Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol) is an IPv6 transition mechanism meant to transmit IPv6 packets between dual-stack nodes on top of an IPv4 network. Unlike 6over4 (an older similar protocol using IPv4 multicast), ISATAP uses IPv4 as a virtual nonbroadcast multiple-access network (NBMA) data link layer, so that it does not require the underlying IPv4 network infrastructure to support multicast. 464XLAT 464XLAT (RFC 6877) allows clients on IPv6-only networks to access IPv4-only Internet services, such as Skype. The client uses a SIIT translator (see above) to convert IPv4 packets (e.g. Skype client software) into IPv6 to send (over an IPv6-only network) to a NAT64 translator (see above) which translates them back into IPv4 to send (over an IPv4-capable network) to an IPv4-only server (e.g. Skype server). The SIIT translator (CLAT: _c_ ustomer- side trans _lat_ or) may be implemented on the client itself (as special software) or an intermediate IPv4-capable LAN (but if it had IPv4 Internet connectivity, 464XLAT would not be needed), and the NAT64 translator (PLAT: _p_ rovider-side trans _lat_ or) must be able to reach both the server and the client (through the CLAT). The use of NAT64 limits connections to a client- server model using UDP, TCP, and ICMP. ;Implementations * There is a CLAT implementation for Android, Android CLAT. T-Mobile USA provides NAT64 with T-Mobile's IPv6-only service. * Orange Poland began IPv6-only (CLAT/NAT64/DNS) service in September 2013.Orange Polska#Mobile network *Android native CLAT implementation appeared in Jelly Bean 4.3. * Windows Phone introduced a native CLAT implementation in 2014 with WP 8.1. * Windows 10 (Creators update) has a native 464XLAT implementation for desktop and mobile. It is enabled for WWAN interfaces when the Mobile Operator has enabled 464xlat on the network * iOS 12.0 features a native CLAT implementation. Additionally, Apple requires all apps submitted to the App Store to work on IPv6 networks. * clatd is a CLAT implementation for Linux. * FreeBSD has had CLAT implementations since 11.3 and 12.1. Dual-Stack Lite (DS-Lite) DS-Lite Dual-Stack Lite technology does not involve allocating an IPv4 address to customer-premises equipment (CPE) for providing Internet access. It is described in RFC 6333. The CPE distributes private IPv4 addresses for the LAN clients, according to the networking requirement in the local area network. The CPE encapsulates IPv4 packets within IPv6 packets. The CPE uses its global IPv6 connection to deliver the packet to the ISP's carrier-grade NAT (CGN), which has a global IPv4 address. The original IPv4 packet is recovered and NAT is performed upon the IPv4 packet and is routed to the public IPv4 Internet. The CGN uniquely identifies traffic flows by recording the CPE public IPv6 address, the private IPv4 address, and TCP or UDP port number as a session.RFC 6333 - Dual-Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion Lightweight 4over6 (RFC 7596) extends DS-Lite by moving the NAT functionality from the ISP side to the CPE, eliminating the need to implement carrier-grade NAT. This is accomplished by allocating a port range for a shared IPv4 address to each CPE. Moving the NAT functionality to the CPE allows the ISP to reduce the amount of state tracked for each subscriber, which improves the scalability of the translation infrastructure. Draft proposals These mechanisms are still being discussed or have been abandoned by the IETF. 4rd IPv4 Residual Deployment (4rd) is a mechanism specified in RFC 7600 to facilitate residual deployment of the IPv4 service across IPv6 networks. Like 6rd, it uses stateless address mappings between IPv6 and IPv4. It supports an extension of IPv4 addressing based on transport-layer ports. This is a stateless variant of the A+P model. MAP Mapping of Address and Port (MAP) is a Cisco IPv6 transition proposal which combines A+P port address translation with tunneling of the IPv4 packets over an ISP provider's internal IPv6 network. , MAP-T and MAP-E are proposed standards. Deprecated mechanisms These mechanisms have been deprecated by the IETF. NAT-PT Network Address Translation/Protocol Translation (NAT-PT) is defined in RFC 2766, but due to numerous problems, it has been obsoleted by RFC 4966 and deprecated to historic status. It is typically used in conjunction with a DNS application-level gateway (DNS-ALG) implementation. NAPT-PT While almost identical to NAT-PT, Network Address Port Translation + Protocol Translation, which is also described in RFC 2766, adds translation of the ports as well as the address. This is done primarily to avoid two hosts on one side of the mechanism from using the same exposed port on the other side of the mechanism, which could cause application instability and/or security flaws. This mechanism has been deprecated by RFC 4966.

There have been a number of 9/11 conspiracy theories with some suggesting that Israel was involved in the attacks and that members of the U.S. government may have deliberately covered-up and falsified events, in order to hide negligence or even complicity, or even having been the perpetrator of the attacks. A number of 9/11 opinion polls have been carried out to assess the prevalence of various opinions and views about questions related to the attacks, both in the United States and in other countries. The size, form and quality of polls naturally vary considerably, as does the range and specificity of questions asked. They range from large, formal polls such as those conducted by Zogby International, to smaller, informal polls of limited scope, and unscientific internet polls. The questions here relate specifically to doubts about the mainstream account, and in all cases were part of a group of questions dealing with wider issues, usually of a political nature. World opinion polls A poll taken by WorldPublicOpinion.org, a collaborative project of research centers in various countries managed by the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland, College Park, polled 16,063 people in 17 nations outside of the United States during the summer of 2008. They found that majorities in only 9 of the 17 countries believe al-Qaeda carried out the attacks. 45 percent of those surveyed said al-Qaeda was responsible, 15 percent said the U.S. government, 7 percent said Israel and 7 percent said some other perpetrator. One in four people said they did not know who was behind the attacks. The summary of the poll noted that \\"Though people with greater education generally have greater exposure to news, those with greater education are only slightly more likely to attribute 9/11 to al Qaeda.\\" Steven Kull, director of WorldPublicOpinion.org, commented \\"It does not appear that these beliefs can simply be attributed to a lack of exposure to information.\\" Of those who said the United States was the perpetrator, Kull says many believe it was an attempt to justify an impending U.S. invasion of Iraq. 500px National opinion polls=United StatesZogby International= The polls that have received the most widespread media attention are those conducted by Zogby International. The Zogby polls have been sponsored by organizations within the 9/11 Truth Movement including 911truth.org. The first one was conducted in late August 2004 on 808 randomly selected residents of New York State. It found that 49 percent of New York City residents and 41 percent of New York state citizens believe individuals within the U.S. government \\"knew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11, 2001, and that they consciously failed to act.\\" The margin of error for this poll was 3.5 percent. The second major Zogby poll on 9/11 was conducted in May 2006. It was a telephone interview of 1,200 randomly selected adults from across the United States, consisting of 81 questions, with a 2.9 percent margin of error. Some of the questions asked include the following: :\\"Some people believe that the US government and its 9/11 Commission concealed or refused to investigate critical evidence that contradicts their official explanation of the September 11th attacks, saying there has been a cover-up. Others say that the 9/11 Commission was a bi-partisan group of honest and well-respected people and that there is no reason they would want to cover-up anything. Who are you more likely to agree with?\\" *Responses: 48% No Cover-up / 42% Cover-up / 10% Not sure :\\"World Trade Center Building 7 is the 47-story skyscraper that was not hit by any planes during the September 11th attacks, but still totally collapsed later the same day. This collapse was not investigated by the 9/11 Commission. Are you aware of this skyscraper's collapse, and if so do you believe that the Commission should have also investigated it? Or do you believe that the Commission was right to only investigate the collapse of the buildings which were directly hit by airplanes?\\" *Responses: 43% Not Aware / 38% Aware - should have investigated it / 14% Aware - right not to investigate it / 5% Not Sure :\\"Some people say that so many unanswered questions about 9/11 remain that Congress or an International Tribunal should re-investigate the attacks, including whether any US government officials consciously allowed or helped facilitate their success. Other people say the 9/11 attacks were thoroughly investigated and that any speculation about US government involvement is nonsense. Who are you more likely to agree with?\\" *Responses: 47% Attacks were thoroughly investigated / 45% Reinvestigate the attacks / 8% Not Sure The third major Zogby poll regarding 9/11 was conducted in August 2007. It was a telephone interview with a target of 1,000 interviews with randomly selected adults from across the United States, consisting of 71 questions, with a 3.1 percent margin of error. The results of the 2007 August poll indicate that 51 percent of Americans want the United States Congress to probe President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney regarding the 9/11 attacks and over 30 percent of those polled seek immediate impeachment. While only 32 percent seek immediate impeachment of Bush and/or Cheney based on their personal knowledge, many citizens appear eager for clear exposure of the facts. In addition, the poll also found that two-thirds (67 percent) of Americans say the 9/11 Commission should have investigated the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7. Only 4.8 percent of the respondents agreed that members of the U.S. government \\"actively planned or assisted some aspects of the attack.\\" =Newsweek magazine polls= The Newsweek magazine poll \\"What America Knows,\\" conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International, regularly asks American citizens a wide range of questions relating to world events both past and present, and a number of more trivial questions of general knowledge. Poll conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International. On five occasions the following question has been asked: :\\"Do you think Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq was directly involved in planning, financing, or carrying out the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001?\\" *September 2003 responses: 47% Yes, 37% No, 16% not sure. *January 2004 responses: 49% Yes, 39% No, 12% not sure. *September 2004 responses: 42% Yes, 44% No, 14% not sure. *October 2004 responses: 36% Yes, 51% No, 13% not sure. *June 2007 responses: 41% Yes, 50% No, 9% not sure. =The New York Times / CBS News polls= The first 9/11 poll carried out by The New York Times and CBS News was conducted in May 2002. The same 9/11-related question was asked again in April 2004 and October 2006. The 2002 and 2006 polls were apparently published for the first time not by the NYT or CBS, but by polling researcher Angus Reid Public Opinion. The 2004 NYT/CBS poll is available at nytimes.com (Question 77). The 2004 poll was conducted by telephone with 1,042 adults nationwide in the United States, with a 3 percent margin of error. The 2006 poll was conducted by telephone on 983 randomly selected citizens of the United States, with a 4 percent margin of error. One of the questions was the following: :\\"When it comes to what they knew prior to September 11th, 2001, about possible terrorist attacks against the United States, do you think members of the Bush Administration are telling the truth, are mostly telling the truth but hiding something, or are they mostly lying?\\" *May 2002 responses: 21% said \\"telling the truth\\", 65% said they are \\"mostly telling the truth but hiding something\\", 8% said they are \\"mostly lying\\", 6% not sure. *3/30‚Äì4/1/04 CBS 24% said \\"telling the truth\\", 58% said they are \\"mostly telling the truth but hiding something\\", 14% said they are \\"mostly lying\\", 4% not sure. *4/8/04 CBS 21% said \\"telling the truth\\", 66% said they are \\"mostly telling the truth but hiding something\\", 10% said they are \\"mostly lying\\", 4% not sure. *4/23‚Äì27/04 24% said \\"telling the truth\\", 56% said they are \\"mostly telling the truth but hiding something\\", 16% said they are \\"mostly lying\\", 4% not sure. *Oct 2006 responses: 16% said \\"telling the truth\\", 53% said they are \\"mostly telling the truth but hiding something\\", 28% said they are \\"mostly lying\\", 3% not sure.

The survey found that 36 percent thought it somewhat or very likely that U.S. officials either participated in the attacks or took no action to stop them because they wanted the United States to go to war in the Middle East. It made some statements relating to some of the 9/11 conspiracy theories and asked respondents to say whether they thought that the statements were likely to be true. :Federal officials either assisted in the 9/11 attacks or took no action to prevent them because they wanted the United States to go to war in the Middle East. :* 59% \\"not likely\\" :* 20% \\"somewhat likely\\" :* 16% \\"very likely\\" Part of survey \\"SHOH33,\\" completed on July 6, 2006. :The collapse of the twin towers in New York was aided by explosives secretly planted in the two buildings. :* 77% \\"unlikely\\" :* 10% \\"somewhat likely\\" :* 6% \\"very likely\\" Part of survey \\"SHOH33,\\" completed on July 6, 2006. :The Pentagon was struck by a military cruise missile in 2001 rather than by an airliner captured by terrorists. :* 80% \\"not likely\\" :* 6% \\"somewhat likely\\" :* 6% \\"very likely\\" Part of survey \\"SHOH33,\\" completed on July 6, 2006. In November 2007, Scripps Howard surveyed 811 Americans about their beliefs in several conspiracy theories and asked this question: :How about that some people in the federal government had specific warnings of the 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington, but chose to ignore those warnings. Is this very likely, somewhat likely or unlikely? :* 32% \\"Very Likely\\" :* 30% \\"Somewhat Likely\\" :* 30% \\"Unlikely\\" :* 8% \\"Don't Know/Other\\" =Other United States polls= Rasmussen Reports published the results of their poll May 4, 2007. According to their press release, \\"Overall, 22% of all voters believe the President knew about the attacks in advance. A slightly larger number, 29%, believe the CIA knew about the attacks in advance. White Americans are less likely than others to believe that either the President or the CIA knew about the attacks in advance. Young Americans are more likely than their elders to believe the President or the CIA knew about the attacks in advance.\\", \\"Thirty-five percent (35%) of Democrats believe he did know, 39% say he did not know, and 26% are not sure.\\" and \\"Republicans reject that view and, by a 7-to-1 margin, say the President did not know in advance about the attacks. Among those not affiliated with either major party, 18% believe the President knew and 57% take the opposite view.\\" A poll reported in The Washington Post in September 2003 found that nearly 70 percent of respondents believed Saddam Hussein was probably personally involved in the attacks. In May 2007 the New York Post published results of a Pew Research Center poll of more than 1,000 American Muslims. It found that 40 percent agreed that \\"Arabs carried out the 9/11 attacks,\\" while 28 percent disagreed. Of the 28 percent that disagreed, a quarter (7 percent) believe that the U.S. government is responsible. In September 2009, a National Obama Approval Poll, by Public Policy Polling, found that 27 percent of respondents who identified themselves as Liberals, and 10 percent as Conservatives, responded \\"yes\\" to the question, \\"Do you think President Bush intentionally allowed the 9/11 attacks to take place because he wanted the United States to go to war in the Middle East?\\" A March 2010 poll conducted by the Angus Reid Public Opinion organization found that 15 percent of respondents found theories that the World Trade Center was brought down by a controlled demolition to be credible. Anywhere between 6 percent and 15 percent of respondents found credibility in claims that United Airlines Flight 93 was shot down, that no airplanes hit the Pentagon or the World Trade Center. Canada In September 2006, an Ipsos-Reid poll found that 22 percent of Canadians believe \\"the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, had nothing to do with Osama bin Laden and were actually a plot by influential Americans.\\" A September 2008 Angus Reid poll showed that 39 percent of respondents either disagree or are unsure that al-Qaeda carried out the attacks. About a third of those surveyed believed the U.S. government allowed the attacks to happen and 16 percent believe the U.S. government made the attacks happen. Mexico The WorldPublicOpinion.org opinion poll conducted during the summer of 2008 found that 33 percent of respondents in Mexico believe al-Qaeda were responsible. 30 percent said the U.S. government were responsible, 1 percent said Israel and 18 percent named another country. 19 percent said they did not know.  Europe  France = The WorldPublicOpinion.org opinion poll conducted during the summer of 2008 found that 63 percent of respondents in France believe al-Qaeda were responsible. 8 percent said the U.S. government were responsible and 7 percent named another country. 23 percent said they did not know. = Germany = The WorldPublicOpinion.org opinion poll conducted during the summer of 2008 found that 64 percent of respondents in Germany believe al-Qaeda were responsible. 23 percent said the U.S. government were responsible, 1 percent said Israel and 2 percent named another country. 9 percent said they did not know. A representative poll conducted in 2003 by the Forsa Institute for the German newspaper Die Zeit found that 31 percent of the Germans under 30 years of age believe that the U.S. government commissioned the attacks. In its January 2011 issue, the German magazine Welt der Wunder published the results of a poll conducted by the Emnid Institute on 1,005 respondents. The poll indicated that almost 90 percent of the Germans are convinced that the government of the United States is not telling the whole truth about the September 11 attacks. = Italy = The WorldPublicOpinion.org opinion poll conducted during the summer of 2008 found that 56 percent of respondents in Italy believe al-Qaeda were responsible. 15 percent said the U.S. government were responsible, 1 percent said Israel and 7 percent named another country. 21 percent said they did not know. = Russia = The WorldPublicOpinion.org opinion poll conducted during the summer of 2008 found that 57 percent of respondents in Russia believe al-Qaeda were responsible. 15 percent said the U.S. government were responsible, 2 percent said Israel and 6 percent named another country. 19 percent said they did not know. A poll placed on the website of Russia Today on September 11, 2008, found that 88 percent of respondents felt that the 9/11 Commission deliberately hid the truth from their report. Only 12 percent felt that they \\"did a great job collecting evidence\\". = Sweden = According to a poll conducted in September 2009 by Novus Opinion on behalf of the television channel TV4, 70 percent of the Swedes believe al-Qaeda was responsible for the attack, while 7 percent said they didn't believe it. Among young people (18-29) the numbers were 58 percent and 15 percent. Asked if they believe the theory represented in the film Loose Change that the U.S. government led by President George W. Bush was involved in the attacks, 64 percent of the public said no versus 8 percent yes, while the numbers for young adults were 51 percent versus 18 percent. One thousand adults were polled, but in order to get a large number of people under 30 years, additional interviews were made.

It is found in Canada and the United States. Its natural habitat is fens. Taxonomy The incurvate emerald was first described in 1918 by Canadian entomologist Edmund Murton Walker, based on specimens from Whitefish Point, Michigan. At the time, he thought it possible that it was only a \\"local race\\" of the closely related forcipate emerald. Description Somatochlora incurvata is a medium-sized, slender, elongate dragonfly about 5.8 cm long. It is larger than many other species in the genus Somatochlora. The thorax and abdomen are metallic brown to black with yellowish brown spots on the sides. The eyes are green. Distribution The incurvate emerald has a relatively restricted range in northeastern North America, ranging from Nova Scotia south to New York and west to Wisconsin. Habitat Incurvate emeralds are found in bogs and fens. The larvae are thought to reside within saturated Sphagnum moss. Eggs are laid in small pools with the breeding habitat, which may even include temporary depressions created by footprints. Adults may be found foraging in a wide variety of other habitats. Life History Like other dragonflies, both larvae and adults feed on smaller insects and other invertebrates. Adults are active in the day from June to October, and the species overwinters as a larvae. Conservation Formerly thought to be rare, more recent surveys have found that the species is reasonably common in parts of its range. Potential threats include peat harvesting, cranberry farming, water pollution, and alteration of water levels. Incurvate Emerald is ranked as globally secure (G5), but is considered rare in many of the states and provinces it is found.

The camp lasts for 4 weeks, usually from mid-July to mid-August. It is based on the campus of Stanford University. Like the Ross Program at Ohio State and the PROMYS program at Boston University, SUMaC does not put emphasis on competition-math preparations but focuses instead on advanced undergraduate math topics. History SUMaC was founded in 1995 by Professors Rafe Mazzeo and Ralph Cohen of the Stanford Mathematics Department and has been directed from the beginning by Prof. Mazzeo, and Dr. Rick Sommer. Dr. Sommer was an assistant professor in the Stanford Mathematics Department and is currently a deputy director of the Education Program for Gifted Youth (EPGY), at Stanford. He designed the Program I course and has been teaching versions of it since the first SUMaC in 1995. The Program II course was designed and has been taught by Prof. Rafe Mazzeo. (In recent years, the course was cotaught by Dr. Pierre Albin, a former Stanford graduate student who currently teaches at MIT, and is currently taught by Dr. Simon Rubinstein-Salzedo, a postdoctoral fellow in statistics at Stanford.) Programs * Program I investigates non- constructibility in geometry, classification of patterns in two dimensions, error-correcting codes, cryptography, and the analysis of the Rubik's Cube. The mathematics that is central to solving these problems comes from the areas of abstract algebra and number theory. * Program II contains an introduction to selected topics in combinatorial, differential, and algebraic topology. The program emphasizes developing ideas from, and problems in, geometric topology where methods from abstract algebra and calculus have proven to be effective tools. Other activities During the camp, there are frequent guest lectures given by internationally renowned mathematicians. These talks are in the areas of current mathematical research. Ravi Vakil, a current Stanford mathematics professor and a 4-time Putnam Fellow, talked to the students in 2007. Also in 2007, Tyson Mao, one of the best cube solvers in the world, taught SUMaC students how to solve the Rubik's Cube. Other speakers in 2007 included Drs. Kay Kirkpatrick (MIT), Ted Shifrin (University of Georgia), and Pete Storm (Stanford). In 2014, John Edmark, professor of art and art history at Stanford, spoke about his current work in mathematics-inspired sculptures, and Brian Conrey, executive director of the American Institute of Mathematics, gave a lecture on the Twin Primes Conjecture and the Riemann Hypothesis. Students at SUMaC also engage in a variety of sports activities during their free time. Such sports include basketball, tennis, badminton, table tennis, and ultimate. SUMaC was the backdrop for Justina Chen Headley's book Nothing But the Truth (and a Few White Lies), a teen novel about a half-Taiwanese girl who finally finds her identity at the math camp. Teaching assistants and counselors Most of the SUMaC residential counselors and teaching assistants are Stanford mathematics graduate students and undergraduate math majors. SUMaC usually has a 1-to-4 ratio of staff to students, with most of the teaching assistants serving in the role of live-in counselors. Many of the SUMaC teaching assistants and counselors return from previous years, and some attended SUMaC in high school. Residence SUMaC students have traditionally been housed in Synergy , a small Stanford-student residence that is a famously vegetarian co-op during the academic year, though there have been years when students lived in Œöappa Œëlpha (KA). Each student has one, two or three roommates, and the floors are divided by sex. Dining takes place at a separate dining hall shared by other summer youth programs at Stanford.

History The Shabelle Media Network was founded in 2002 in Merca, Somalia by a group of young Somali intellectuals. Its mission was to ensure that Somalis around the world remain abreast of developments within the Somali community and in touch with each other. The network's first phase was focused on airing to Africa, Asia and Australia via Thaicom 3 satellite. In 2005, it expanded to include satellite broadcasts to North America and Europe. SMN's Radio Shabelle slowly grew to become one of Somalia's most respected privately owned radio stations, airing from 6 a.m. to midnight. It later relocated its headquarters to the national capital, Mogadishu. Prior to Mogadishu's pacification by the Somali National Army in mid-2011, the independent Radio Shabelle, among other Somali media outlets, was frequently targeted by Islamist militants. Among the casualties during this most volatile 2007-2011 period was Radio Shabelle's acting manager, Bashir Nur Gedi, who was killed on October 19, 2007. In 2009, the station's director Mukhtar Mohamed Hirabe was also assassinated.\\"Media Executive of Prominent Radio Station Assassinated in Mogadishu\\" , Shabelle.net After their ouster, the insurgents resorted to issuing death threats and targeted assassinations in order to discourage reporting on their activities. Due to frustration at the increasing number of expatriate journalists returning to the capital after the relative improvement in security, the militants in 2012 intensified their anti-media campaign, killing four SMN reporters during the year, including director Hassan Osman Abdi. Despite the attempted intimidation, journalists have persisted in covering the war beat. Through membership in the National Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ), reporters are also spearheading a governmental initiative to reform the 2007 Somali media law. Services SMN broadcasts news, business, analysis, culture and sports items via its radio and television network. It airs its own programs and documentaries through both terrestrial and satellite transmissions. The organization also reports on domestic peace initiatives and conferences, provides a platform for the discussion of issues of interest to the Somali community, and offers call-in services wherein listeners and/or viewers can interact with program participants. Shabelle Media Network's main target audience is the Somali community, both within the Horn of Africa and abroad. Its broadcasts are also geared toward local policy makers and international stakeholders. Awards In 2010, Radio Shabelle was awarded the Media of the Year prize by the Paris-based journalism organization, Reporters Without Borders (RSF).Press Freedom Prize goes to Somali radio station Radio Shabelle See also *List of journalists killed during the Somali civil war *Media of Somalia ReferencesExternal links * Somali Shabelle Media Network official site Category:Mass media companies of Somalia Category:Mass media companies established in 2002 Category:2002 establishments in Somalia Category:Television channels and stations established in 2002 Category:Mass media in Mogadishu ","title":"Shabelle Media Network"},{"id":"12711767","text":"Iveria may refer to: Places * Radisson Blu Iveria Hotel, Tbilisi, a hotel Georgia * Iveria, an archaic name for the country of Georgia Other uses * Iverian or Mingrelian language, spoken in Western Georgia * FC Iveria Khashuri, a Georgian football club * VIA Iveria, a Georgian music group from the 1970s‚Äì1980s * Iveria, a magazine edited (1877‚Äì1905) by Ilia Chavchavadze See also * Iberia (disambiguation) ","title":"Iveria"},{"id":"12711768","text":"Russell James Liberman (September 12, 1945)Street Muscle Mag bio (retrieved 30 December 2018) ‚Äì September 9, 1977Dragtimes.ru (retrieved 30 December 2018)) was an American funny car drag racer, nicknamed \\"Jungle Jim\\".

Roberta passed away on December 28 2004, at age 56 in Florence, OR.  Early life  Liberman was born in Pennsylvania. He dropped out of high school in his junior year and began racing when he moved to Northern California.  Drag racing career  He began drag racing in the Stock division at Fremont Raceway in 1964 and made a jump up to funny cars in 1965, driving an injected Nova on nitromethane dubbed Hercules. Later that year he started on the national scene as the driver of Lew Arrington's supercharged GTO Funny Car, Brutus. In 1966, Liberman went out on his own in his first supercharged (steel-bodied) Chevy II, the first to wear the \\"Jungle Jim\\" name.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Favorite Race Car Ever voting: Early Funny Cars\\", written 21 July 2008, at NHRA.com (retrieved 1 October 2018) In 1967, he went on a tour that established him as a household name within drag racing circles across the country. Despite making eight second runs in his Chevy when other top dragracers in factory-sponsored cars made runs in the seven second range, he gained a large fan following. Liberman was more interesting. He won the hearts of the spectators after he did wheelstands for the full length of the track in a two race match race against Don Nicholson. Liberman's success in 1967 prompted him to run a two car team in 1968. His choice as the first driver in his second car was Clare Sanders. Others drivers using Liberman's cars included Ron Attebury, Jake Crimmins, Roy Harris, Russell Long, Pete Williams, and former partner Arrington. The team went on to include a Steve Kanuika-owned and sponsored nine-second heads-up '69 Camaro and a Dutch Irrgang-driven '72 Vega Pro Stocker. Super Stock & Drag Illustrated had a story idea that required the total disassembly of a Funny Car down to the last nut and bolt for a true exploded-view picture. Nearly every leading driver in the category turned down the magazine's request. Liberman complied, and the resulting publicity only added to his legend. Another one of his strengths was that Liberman was the main Chevrolet banner carrier.  Sidekick  His sidekick was \\"Jungle Pam.\\" Liberman met 18-year-old Pamela Hardy two weeks before she graduated from high school in May, 1972 when he spotted her walking while driving his yellow Corvette. Hardy, who had been accepted to West Chester State, intended to major in business. Instead, she became Liberman's girlfriend and toured with him for four years. \\"I ditched the college that had accepted me, and it drove my mother nuts,\\" she later recalled. Liberman, eager to get fan's attention at the track, initially hired Hardy to stage his funny car on the line. Hardy is well-endowed and was always braless. She usually wore a tank top or skimpy halter and jean shorts with \\"zero-inch inseam\\". Her enticing performance gathered a lot of attention. Liberman and Hardy briefly appeared in Vrooom!, a 16-minute documentary directed by Ken Rudolph about a day at a drag race track. They also were featured in several auto magazines with Hardy typically wearing go-go boots, short-shorts, and titillating tops. She appeared on the February 1973 cover of Hot Rod magazine. She earned the nickname \\"Jungle Pam\\" Hardy. She not only staged the car and checked under the vehicle for fluid leaks before a run, but filled the block with water and eight quarts of 70W oil, packed parachutes after each run, and helped Liberman reposition his car on the line after his burnouts.The Legend of ‚ÄúJungle Pam‚Äù Hardy Her presence on the track was described as \\"a stroke of genius\\" and raised the profile of Liberman's team and Funny Car racing in general. She said of Liberman, \\"All that showmanship was his true personality. He just didn't turn that on at the track and then became normal like everyone else at home. He had that sort of flair even when we were just at the house or went out some place. You could always feel his presence wherever he was.\\" She described Liberman as a gifted mechanic and said that before he was killed he was considering building engines instead of racing. After Liberman's death, Hardy never worked with another driver. She later married Funny Car owner Fred Frey and after they divorced, Bill Hodgson, who tunes George Reidnauer‚Äôs Excalibur Corvette Nostalgia Funny Car.  NHRA  Liberman distrusted the NHRA and preferred the barn storming nature of match racing with its guaranteed payouts for three runs, win or lose, over racing on the NHRA circuit. He had one national event win in NHRA competition at the 1975 Summernationals at Englishtown, New Jersey. His second car was driven by Clare Sanders to victory at the 1969 Winternationals. During 1972 and 1973, Liberman attended 100 race meets; this record was matched only by \\"TV Tommy\\" Ivo and Ed \\"The Ace\\" McCulloch.Motorsport.com (retrieved 14 September 2018) Liberman drove a Vega funny car, in three distinct incarnations.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"'Jungle's' Vega: Who knows which nose?\\", written 16 December 2016, at NHRA.com (retrieved 16 September 2018) The first Vega, painted candy blue, appeared in August 1972, was also driven by Pam Hardy, and was on the cover of Hot Rod. Designed by Romeo Palamides, it was bodied by Ron Pelligrini's company, Fiberglass Ltd. The second Vega was driven primarily by Roy Harris, and was painted a darker candy blue than the first. It was the subject of a Revell model kit. The third made its debut in 1974.  Death  Liberman was driving his Corvette street car in West Goshen Township near West Chester, Pennsylvania when he rounded a corner on the West Chester Pike at excessive speed and collided with a SEPTA transit bus head-on September 9, 1977, killing him. The car was wedged under the bumper and underchassis of the bus. It took responders more than 45 minutes to extricate his body from the wreckage.

Murray is an American mining engineer and businessman. He founded and was the chief executive officer of Murray Energy, a mining corporation based in St. Clairsville, Ohio, until it filed for bankruptcy. Murray has received attention for his denial of climate change, his actions following the Crandall Canyon Mine collapse and his consistent support of the Republican Party. Early life Murray claims to have lied about his age so he could work in a coal mine at the age of 16 and provide for his family. He alleges he experienced multiple mining accidents including a head injury involving a large beam. Murray says he has one scar running from his head down his back from a separate accident and at one time was trapped in a dark mine for 12 hours before being rescued. Murray was the valedictorian of the Bethesda High School class of 1957. Murray received a Bachelor of Engineering in Mining from Ohio State University. Thereafter, he attended a six-week management program at Harvard Business School. Career Murray began his mining career at the North American Coal Corporation (NACC). He served in a variety of capacities at NACC, winning election to vice president of operations in 1969. From 1974 to 1983, Murray was president of NACC's Western Division and presided over four of its subsidiaries in North Dakota. In 1974, a strike took place at the Indian Head Mine in Zap, which North American was attempting to close. In 1983, he became president and CEO of North American. Murray is a member of the boards of directors of the National Mining Association, American Coal Foundation, National Coal Council, Ohio Coal Association, and Pennsylvania Coal Association. He is a trustee and former president of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers, Inc., and the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration, Inc., as well as past president of The Rocky Mountain Coal Mining Institute.Murray Energy Corporation Web site Murray Energy Murray started his company in 1988 with the purchase of a single continuous mining operation with an annual output of one million tons per year. Murray Energy Corporation's strategy involves acquiring high sulfur coal reserves and aiming to be the low-cost producer in primary coal-sourcing regions of the United States. This strategy was based on Murray's belief that the transportation of low-sulfur coal thousands of miles from the Powder River Basin to meet the growing demand for electricity in some parts of the country was not a viable long-term solution. Murray also claimed to be inspired to open the mine when a squirrel told him: \\"Bob Murray, you should be operating your very own mines.\\" At the helm of Murray Energy, he began accumulating reserves that were strategically located near customers, near favorable transportation, and high in energy content (BTU per pound). Murray told the White House in a letter dated August 4, 2017, that without an emergency order to restart coal-fired electrical generating plants, his company and a major customer, power plant operator FirstEnergy Solutions, would declare bankruptcy. Murray Energy Holdings, Co. filed bankruptcy in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio on October 29, 2019. Murray was replaced as CEO the same day, although he remains chairman of the board of the new entity, Murray NewCo, while his nephew Robert D. Moore will be president and CEO. Employees expressed concern about losing their pensions and/or medical benefits. Murray is the last major coal contributor to the United Mine Workers of America's pension plan. Crandall Canyon Mine collapse In August 2007, six miners were trapped at the Crandall Canyon Mine in Utah, of which Murray Energy independent operating subsidiary UtahAmerican Energy had been a part-owner for 12 months. Prior to the collapse, the Crandall Canyon Mine had received 64 violations and $12,000 in fines. Murray himself claims that the Crandall Canyon Mine collapse was triggered by a natural 3.9 magnitude earthquake, and that the practice of retreat mining was not responsible. Responding to reports of retreat mining, Murray said: \\"I wish you would take the word retreat mining out of your vocabulary. Those were words invented by Davitt McAteer, Oppegard, who are lackies for the United Mine Workers, and officials at the United Mine Workers, who would like to organize this coal mine.\\" However, expert seismologists and government officials dispute this claim, stating that the mine collapse was the cause of a coal mine bump caused by the mine's use of retreat mining. Richard E. Stickler, the government's top mine safety official, said: \\"It was not‚Äîand I repeat, it was not‚Äîa natural occurring earthquake.\\" An analysis by seismologists at the University of California, Berkeley demonstrated that the seismic event was \\"consistent with an underground collapse\\". Researchers at the University of Utah also confirmed that the tremor was not triggered by an earthquake as Murray had claimed. On July 24, 2008, the U.S. government's Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) announced its highest penalty for coal mine safety violations, $1.85 million, for the collapse. The government fined Genwal Resources $1.34 million \\"for violations that directly contributed to the deaths of six miners last year,\\" plus nearly $300,000 for other violations. The government also levied a $220,000 fine against a mining consultant, Agapito Associates, \\"for faulty analysis of the mine's design.\\" Robert Murray was heavily criticized for his actions during the rescue attempt. The MSHA cited his volatile behavior, especially at daily briefings for family members. MSHA reported that he \\"frequently became very irate and would start yelling,\\" even making young children cry. He told family members that \\"the media is telling you lies\\" and \\"the union is your enemy.\\" Political activity From 2005 to 2007, the Murray Energy PAC donated over $150,000 to Republican candidates, including donations totaling $30,000 to Senate candidates such as George Allen, Sam Brownback, and Katherine Harris. Donations to Republicans surpassed $1 million from 2005 to 2018. The Ohio Valley Coal PAC, another group affiliated with Murray Energy, donated $10,000 for George W. Bush's 2000 Presidential campaign. In addition to serving on the board of directors of the National Mining Association (NMA), Murray actively lobbies for pro-industry legislation through his company's political action committee. In 2001, he testified on behalf of the NMA before a House Ways and Means subcommittee in favor of proposed tax cuts. In the wake of 2006's Sago Mine disaster, lawmakers in West Virginia and Ohio proposed legislation requiring mine workers to wear emergency tracking devices. Murray lobbied against the laws, calling them \\"extremely misguided.\\" He said that politicians were rushing to pass laws and thus \\"playing politics with the safety of my employees.\\" Murray said that rather than create \\"knee-jerk\\" state laws after the disaster, such as in the case of West Virginia, which passed the law in less than one day after it was proposed, the federal government should host a panel which would study the industry and make recommendations for safety measures. Murray claimed that the federal government should be involved for uniform standards and because tension between unions and companies created difficulty in reaching private agreement on safety standards. Murray maintained that the personal tracking devices to be mandated in the state laws, called PEDs, did not work under certain common mining conditions (such as below in depth), and better devices needed to be developed in order to effectively guard miners in case of accident. He said: \\"The will is there. Unfortunately, the technology isn't.\\" Murray has stated that he supported federal mandates for drug testing and fire prevention. On August 14, 2012, Murray hosted Mitt Romney at Murray Energy's Century coal mine in Beallsville, Ohio. Several miners contacted a nearby morning talk radio host, David Blomquist, to complain that they were forced to attend the rally without pay. Murray chief operating officer Robert Moore said: \\"Attendance was mandatory but no one was forced to attend the event.\\" Murray closed the mine the day of the rally and suspended pay to workers, arguing that the rally was important to the coal industry and that attending was in the workers' \\"best interest.\\" Murray and his corporation were a major donor to Romney and other Republicans, and employees report frequent instances of political pressure from management. In October 2012, the non-profit group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission against Murray and his company alleging violations of federal campaign law in which employees of Murray Energy were required to give one percent of their salary to the company's political action committee. On November 9, 2012, three days following the presidential election, Murray laid off 156 workers, citing a supposed \\"war on coal\\" by the Obama administration as the reason for his decision. During the 2016 American presidential election, Murray Energy donated over $300,000 towards candidate Donald Trump's inauguration. A memo from Robert Murray itemized a list of 16 energy actions he desired, including giving subsidies to nuclear and coal plants, reducing mine safety regulations, and reducing environmental oversight. The memo was given to Vice President Mike Pence, a similar memo was given to Department of Energy head Rick Perry, and Murray said he gave the memo to Donald Trump. Murray has continued to actively lobby on energy matters at both the state and national levels. Lawsuits= Journalists and the press  Murray has filed over a dozen defamation lawsuits against journalists and newspapers, none of which reached judgment in his favor. As an example of the repeated lawsuits against journalists, Robert Murray and Murray Energy filed a lawsuit on August 27, 2012, against environment reporter Ken Ward Jr. and The Charleston Gazette.  Last Week Tonight  In June 2017, Murray Energy issued a cease and desist letter to the television show Last Week Tonight following the show's attempt to obtain comment about the coal industry. The show went ahead with the episode (June 18), in which host John Oliver discussed the Crandall Canyon Mine collapse and expressed the opinion that Murray did not do enough to protect his miners' safety. Three days later, Murray and his companies brought suit against Oliver, the show's writers, HBO, and Time Warner. The lawsuit alleged that, in the Last Week Tonight show, Oliver \\"incited viewers to do harm to Mr. Murray and his companies.\\" The ACLU filed an amicus brief in support of HBO in the case; the brief has been described as \\"hilarious,\\" and the \\"snarkiest legal brief ever.\\" The brief also included a comparison of Murray with the fictional character Dr. Evil that was used in the Oliver show, with the explanation that \\"it should be remembered that truth is an absolute defense to a claim of defamation.\\" On August 11, 2017 a federal district court judge ruled that Murray Energy suits against The New York Times and HBO could each proceed in a lower state court. The suit against HBO was dismissed with prejudice on February 21, 2018. In November 2019, John Oliver discussed the implications of the lawsuit on his show after Murray dropped the suit. Oliver noted that Murray was able to incur little risk to himself by filing his lawsuit in West Virginia, a jurisdiction that neither Oliver nor Murray lived in and that did not have any anti-SLAPP legislation. HBO was forced to cover $200,000 in legal fees, which smaller media outlets would not be able to absorb, discouraging negative coverage of Murray. Murray's reputation for litigiousness may have deterred other media outlets from covering him, including sexual harassment charges against him. The 2019 episode ended with a musical number, led by Oliver, telling Murray to \\"eat shit\\", in which a series of intentionally outlandish and obviously false accusations were leveled at Murray, citing a statement by Jeffrey D. Cramer ‚Äì the circuit court judge in the case between Murray and Oliver ‚Äì noting that the Supreme Court has long upheld \\"'loose, figurative' language that cannot reasonably be understood to convey facts\\" as protected speech. The song's telling Murray to \\"eat shit\\" was a reference to a 2015 incident where, in response to a bonus program implemented at one of Murray's mines which union members feared would undermine safety, a miner voided his bonus check, wrote \\"Eat Shit Bob\\" on the back of it, and returned it to management, which Oliver covered in his original 2017 episode on the coal industry.  Workplace harassment  In 2019, two lawsuits were filed against Murray for sexual harassment and misconduct against his employees. In one of the corroborated claims, Murray asked a female assistant to search for the kidney stone he passed. Murray denied the allegations. Global warming In June 2007, Murray told the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works that \\"the science of global warming is suspect.\\" He also wrote in a May 2007 MarketWatch editorial: \\"The actual environmental risk associated with carbon emissions is highly speculative.\\" In a 2007 speech to the New York Coal Trade Association, Murray called Al Gore \\"the shaman of global gloom and doom\\" and added: \\"he is more dangerous than his global warming.\\" Murray is a particular opponent of proposed global warming legislation in Congress, saying: > We produce a product that is essential to the standard of living of every > American, because our coal produces 52% of the energy in America today, and > it is the lowest cost energy, costing one-third to one-fourth the cost of > energy from natural gas, nuclear and renewable energy resources. And without > coal to manufacture electricity, our products will not compete in the global > marketplace against foreign countries, because our manufacturers depend on > coal, low-cost electricity and people on fixed incomes will not be able to > pay their electric bills. Every one of those global warming bills that have > been introduced into Congress today eliminates the coal industry and will > increase your electric rates, four to five fold. Following the presidential election in November 2016, Murray pressed for Donald Trump to withdraw the United States from all international agreements on climate change and stated: \\"so-called global warming is a total hoax.\\" These claims were made in spite of near-universal agreement in the scientific community that climate change is a real, progressing, and primarily human- caused phenomenon. Personal life Murray resides in Moreland Hills, Ohio with his wife, Brenda Lou Moore. They have three children.Tizon, Thomas Alex (August 9, 2007). \\"Mine's part-owner sings praises of the work as he reports on collapse that has trapped six\\". The Detroit News.

In September 2020, he filed application for black lung benefits with the U.S. Department of Labor. While running coal mining companies, Murray disputed claims filed by miners for black lung benefits, and was an advocate against federal regulations intended to reduce black lung.

History The club was formed in 1927 by the initiative of a group of important citizens of Lajkovac and was initially named as Sport Klub ≈Ωelezniƒçar (SK ≈Ωelezniƒçar). The first matches took place only in 1929 the year when the first field was made. The chairman of the club was Mr. Aleksandar Dra≈°koviƒá who was the person who brought the first football to the town and was also in this initial period the club's main player. Since the owner of the field didn't allowed the tree that was standing in the halfline to be cut the club had to move to a new one. But, it was soon, after this anegdotical event, that the club settled in a new definitive field in 1933, when the new club president, Dr. Eng. Miroslav Markoviƒá was already in charge. That year the club was registered in the Football Federation of Belgrade and it qualified to the league of the county of Kolubara. Between 1934 and 1937 the club had some difficulties to form a squad, but it was in 1938 that the club returns to competition. The locals remember with enthusiasm the train travels they made to follow the team in their visiting matches. In the season 1938‚Äì39 three players are called to represent the team of the Kolubara county: Miladin Iliƒá, Jakov Vidoviƒá and Dunda Kuƒçenoviƒá. However, the best club player of this period was Stanko Milovanoviƒá, nicknamed Pop (\\"The priest\\"), who played at the higher lever with several times national champions, Belgrade's SK Jugoslavija and later for FK Partizan. The Second World War marked a period when in the town other clubs were formed: Omladinac in 1943, and ≈ΩAK in 1944. In the latter played the Yugoslav national team player Broƒáiƒá. During the war, ≈Ωelezniƒçar had been disbanded, but with the liberation of Yugoslavia in 1945 and by the initiative of the citizens of the town, the club was formed again and Omladinac was merged with all their players joining the club. By the end of 1946 and beginning of 1947 the town lives a sports revival. The Serbian Gymnastics Federation opens its branch in the town, and there is created a section dedicated to athletics named \\"Partizan\\". ≈Ωelezniƒçar also creates sections dedicated to chess and handball. As curiosity, many players that were Serbian handball champions in 1947 were also footballers in the club. That year, the football club begins competing from beginning, in the league of the sub-federation of Valjevo. Thanks to the Serbian Gymnastics Federation sports and physical culture gain massive impulse in the town. The school centers and the clubs are modernized and ≈Ωelezniƒçar receives a new field to develop. In this period the work with youth teams gets special attention. In 1953 the club achieves promotion to League of the Belgrade sub-federation. In this decade the club usually competed at this level, and the important players worth naming beside the club's top scorer Kalman Sabov and the captain Dr. Miodrag Bankoviƒá, are Milorad Ivanoviƒá and Radomir Iliƒá. Since the 1960s until the breakaway of Yugoslavia the club competes mostly in the league of the sub-federation of Kolubara.History at official club website. It is perhaps in the late 1990s until 2002 that the club achieved its maximum success by participating in the Second League of FR Yugoslavia. The participation of the club in national level several consecutive seasons gave to the club some prestige that was missing earlier. But by the middle 2000s the club has fallen again to further lower leagues managing to return in 2007 to the Srpska Liga West (3rd national tier) a level that has been maintained for four consecutive seasons, by 2011.League stands between 1998 and 2010 at clubs page at Srbijafudbal.

Their preference is for sandy to somewhat gravelly soil and are considered a sand obligate species. They are found associated with the roots of local sunflower species, Ambrosia sp. and Encelia sp. Despite the arid environments in which they are found, they prefer high humidity and are most commonly observed following winter or spring rainstorms.beneath surface debris. During the hot and dry summer they pass daylight hours in deep burrows, only occasionally being found on the surface at night. Their preference for the western edge of the valley, which is cooler and more moist than the eastern part, may mean that they have a highly restricted range. Their food preference is for tubers, roots, and various plant detritus, but have also been observed consuming dead animals and are occasionally cannibalistic.

It lies on the Midland Highway, roughly halfway between Hobart and Launceston, carrying over two million vehicles per year. It is said to have been designed by James Blackburn, architect to Melbourne and a convict himself. It was constructed of 1,250,000 handmade bricks on dry land, and after its completion the river was diverted to flow under the bridge.

It is native to Southern California in the United States, and northern Baja California in northwest Mexico. Description This fairy shrimp, Streptocephalus woottoni, lives in vernal pools or other seasonal pools at least 30 centimeters in depth, and can be observed in January through March. It feeds on microscopic organisms such as bacteria and protozoa. The eggs are cysts that can tolerate drying and persist in the soil through the dry seasons until pools are formed by rainwater. The shrimp then hatches and completes its life cycle in 7 or 8 weeks.USFWS. Streptocephalus woottoni Five-year Review. September 2008. Conservation This organism can only be found in: five locations in southern California in Riverside County and San Diego County; and two in northern Baja California. Some known population occurrences have been extirpated, including the type locality in Murrieta, in the Peninsular Ranges foothills. The shrimp is threatened by the loss, degradation, and fragmentation of its habitat. Streptocephalus woottoni is a federally listed endangered species of the United States. In December 2012, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service identified 1,724 acres of critical habitat of the shrimp.

She was the last of the 15 vessels, which were built to a design by John Williams. Early career She was commissioned in September 1782 under Captain William Dickson, and recommissioned in March 1783 as a guardship at Plymouth. She was recommissioned in September 1786 under Charles Chamberlyane, still as a guardship, and paid off in February 1788. In April 1795 she was recommissioned under Captain Joseph Ellison, for Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren's squadron for the Quiberon operation. Standard sailed for the East Indies on 28 February 1796, temporarily under the command of Captain Lukin. By October she was in the North Sea. In February 1797 she was under Captain Thomas Parr, and then in September under Captain Thomas Shivers. From mid-April to mid-May, Standard was one of the many vessels caught up in the Nore Mutiny. On 5 May the crew had taken over the ship and trained cannon on officer‚Äôs country over the issue of pay in arrears. After the mutiny collapsed, William Wallis, one of the leaders on Standard, shot himself to avoid trial and hanging. William Redfern, her surgeon's mate, was sentenced to death for his role in the mutiny, later commuted to transportation for life to the colony of New South Wales.Richards, p.1610 She was recommissioned in February 1799 as a prison ship at Sheerness under lieutenant Thomas Pamp. In November she was fitted as a convalescent ship at Chatham. One month later she was recommissioned under Lieutenant Jacques Dalby as a hospital ship at Sheerness. Mediterranean Between March and May 1801 Standard was re-fitted at Chatham as a 64-gun ship, being commissioned in April under Captain Charles Stewart, for the North Sea. She was paid off, repaired, fitted at various times, and recommissioned in August 1805, Standard was recommissioned under Captain Thomas Harvey. She then sailed to the Mediterranean to join Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Louis's squadron. Duckworth's squadron forcing the Dardanelles While in the Mediterranean she served during Vice Admiral Sir John Duckworth's unsuccessful 1807 Dardanelles Operation.Howard, pp.15-20. On 19 February, Standard suffered three wounded while forcing the Dardanelles. Near a redoubt on Point Pesquies the British encountered a Turkish squadron of one ship of 64 guns, four frigates and eight other vessels, most of which they ran aground. Marines from spiked the 31 guns on the redoubt. Standard and destroyed three Turkish frigates that had run ashore. On 27 February Standard had two men wounded assisting a Royal Marine landing party on the island of Prota. On the way out, the Turkish castle at Abydos fired on the British squadron. Granite cannonballs weighing and measuring in circumference hit , Standard, and . The shot itself killed four men on Standard. It also started a fire and explosion that led four seamen to jump overboard. In all, Standard lost four dead, 47 wounded, and four missing (believed drowned). In all, the British lost 29 killed and 138 wounded. No ship was lost.James (1837), Vol. 4, pp. 296-312. On 26 March 1808, she and the 38-gun frigate Active captured the Franco-Italian brig , which they took to Malta as a prize. Captain Richard Mowbray of Active took possession of Friedland after a chase of several hours. The brig might have escaped had she not lost her topmast. She was one year old and was armed with 16 French 12-pounder guns. Active took her prize to Malta, together with the prisoners, who included Commodore Don Amilcar Paolucci, commander in chief of the Italian Marine and Knight of the Iron Crown. On 16 June, Standard was sailing off Corfu when she encountered the Italian gunboat Volpe, which was armed with one iron 4-pounder, and the French dispatch boat Legera. When the wind fell, Harvey sent his pinnace, his cutter and his yawl in pursuit. The British caught up with their quarry after having rowed for two hours. They captured Volpe despite facing stiff resistance and ran Legera aground about four miles north of Cape St. Mary. The French crew took to the rocks above their vessel and kept up a continuous small arms fire on the British seamen who took possession of the vessel and towed her off. They then burned both vessels. Despite the resistance and small arms fire the British had suffered no casualties. Last years In 1809 she served in the Gunboat War in the Baltic under Captain Aiskew Hollis. On 18 May a squadron consisting of Standard, the frigate , and the vessels , , , and captured the island of Anholt. A landing party of seamen and marines under the command of Captain William Selby of Owen Glendower, with the assistance of Captain Edward Nicolls of the Standards marines, landed. The Danish garrison of 170 men put up a sharp but ineffectual resistance that killed one British marine and wounded two; the garrison then surrendered. The British took immediate possession of the island. Hollis, in his report, stated that Anholt was important in that it could furnish supplies of water to His Majesty's fleet, and afford a good anchorage to merchant vessels sailing to and from the Baltic. However, the principal objective of the mission was to restore the lighthouse on the island to its pre-war state to facilitate the movement of British men of war and merchantmen navigating the dangerous seas there.James (1827), p. 130. On 19 December 1810 Standard sailed for the Mediterranean again. In February 1811 she was on the Portugal station, temporarily under Captain Joshua Horton. In May she was under the temporary command of Captain Charles Fleming. Fate Standard was paid off into ordinary in 1813. She was broken up in 1816.

Known as Bypass Road, the state highway runs from a dead end adjacent to the junction of U.S. Route 13 (US 13) and US 113 north to MD 756 within Pocomoke City. What is now MD 359 and unsigned MD 250A was part of a bypass of the center of Pocomoke City for the southernmost part of US 113 that was constructed in the mid-1930s. US 113 originally followed MD 756 to its southern terminus at what is now US 13 Business. The bypass was itself bypassed in the 1970s when US 113 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway to end at US 13. Route description View south along MD 359 at MD 756 near Pocomoke City MD 359 begins at a dead end adjacent to Worcester Post 93 of the American Legion. The state highway heads north as a two-lane undivided road and meets American Legion Drive (unsigned MD 359B), which provides access to US 113 near its southern terminus at US 13. MD 359 continues north through a mix of residences and farms, meeting Carter Road, Byrd Road, and Groton Road at a five-way intersection. The state highway reaches its northern terminus at an oblique intersection with MD 756 (Old Snow Hill Road), a short distance west of MD 756's end at US 113. History US 113 presently follows its third alignment in Pocomoke City. The first alignment, to which US 113 was assigned in 1927, began at US 13 (now US 13 Business) within the city limits, following Sixth Street and Linden Avenue to the western end of what is now MD 756. US 113 then followed MD 756 to its present intersection with US 113. The second alignment is followed by present-day MD 250A and MD 359 between US 13 (now US 13 Business) and MD 756, and MD 359A north of MD 756. This bypass was completed in 1936. The present US 113 four-lane divided highway was constructed in 1974, cutting off the second alignment's direct access to US 13, which had moved to its own four-lane divided bypass of Pocomoke City in 1963.

He served as pastor of churches in Alabama, Florida, Kentucky and Indiana prior to joining the faculty of SBTS in 1994 as founding dean of the Billy Graham School of Missions, Evangelism and Church Growth. Also while serving at SBTS, Rainer founded and served as president and CEO of the Rainer Group. In September 2005, Rainer was unanimously elected by the trustees of LifeWay Christian Resources to succeed James T. Draper as the ninth president of LifeWay, one of the world's largest Christian resource providers.

Great Commission resurgence In the 2005 Spring edition of the Southern Baptist Journal of Theology, Rainer published a tribute and a review of the Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence after 25 years. The article entitled \\"A Resurgence Not Yet Realized,\\" noted that, though a theological turnaround had taken place in the Southern Baptist Convention, there was little indication that a resurgence of evangelism had taken place in the churches. In the article Rainer called for a \\"great commission resurgence\\", a phrase that would become the nomenclature for a renewed Great Commission emphasis in the SBC years later. Awards and recognition In the spring of 2004, Rainer was invited to be a member of the Society of Fellows for the R. G. Lee Center for Christian Ministry at Union University. In 2008, Rainer received the M. E. Dodd Denominational Service Award from Union University. The Dodd Award is the highest denominational service award Union gives.

The award is given annually to a leader within the SBC who displays excellence and leadership in Southern Baptist life, as well as friendship and commitment to Union University. Past recipients include Jimmy Draper (2004), Adrian Rogers (2005), Morris Chapman (2006) and Frank Page (2007). On November 11, 2010, Rainer received the Donald A.

Life Born in Santiago de Guatemala, present day Antigua Guatemala, towards the end of the 17th century, Quir√≥s had a religious education while pursuing his musical apprenticeship and reaching the level of a journeyman. Having taken Franciscan orders, he was put in charge of the Franciscan press, where he served until 1738, when he was appointed chapel master of the cathedral choir and orchestra. He served in this capacity for 27 years, until his death in 1765. As chapel master, he was in charge of the education of choir boys and apprentices, besides conducting the cathedral liturgical music. Among his pupils, the most outstanding was Rafael Antonio Castellanos. Quir√≥s is the first musician in the New World to receive a critical review. On the occasion of the ceremonies that elevated the Bishopric of Guatemala to the rank of an Archbishopric, Quir√≥s provided liturgical music during the nine days of celebration in November, 1745. Writer Antonio de Paz y Salgado, a high official in the Spanish colonial government, published his enthusiastic review of these musical performances two years later in Mexico City. A considerable number of Quir√≥s' works are contained in the archive at Guatemala Cathedral. Works Besides arranging a sizable amount of music sent from Spain, Lima, and Mexico City, Quir√≥s also provided a number of original villancicos, sacred songs, and cantatas for matins of different feasts of the Catholic year: * C√°ndidos cisnes, solo voice, continuo * Oigan una xacarilla, solo voice, continuo * Una escuela de muchachos, 4 voices, horns, violins and continuo * Venid, venid a las aras de Dios y de Juan, solo voice, continuo * Yo la tengo de cantar, solo voice, continuo * Cantad, gilguerillos, 2 treble voices, continuo * Clarines suaves, 2 treble voices, continuo * Jes√∫s, Jes√∫s, y lo que subes (1743), 2 treble voices, continuo * Hoy que en las sacras aras, 2 voices, continuo * Oh admirable sacramento, 2 voices, continuo * Vagelillo que al viento, 2 voices, 2 violins, continuo * Ay ni√±a bella, 2 voices, continuo * Joseph Antonio, tus dos nombres, 2 voices, continuo * Oigan los triunfos de Domingo Santo, 2 voices, continuo * Qu√© bien, chorus, continuo * Ay Jes√∫s, chorus, continuo * A el pan de los cielos den adoraciones, chorus, continuo * Lucid fragante rosa, chorus, continuo (1741) * Un hombre Dios, 4 voices, continuo * Luz a luz, y gracia a gracia * El baratillo (1758) ;Liturgical works on Latin texts * Cor mundum, voice, two violins, continuo * Liberame, voice, two violins, continuo * Auditi meo, two choirs, continuo * Ne recorderis, chorus, continuo * Iod manum suam, solo voice, continuo * Parce mihi Domine, two choirs, continuo * Laudate pueri Dominum, SATB chorus, 2 violins, continuo * Sanctus Deus (1760), chorus, continuo ;Negrillos * Digo a Siola Negla (1736) * Pues que de pascuas estamos (1745) * Amotinados los negros * Jesuclisa Magdalena (1745) * Vengo turo flanciquillo (1746) References * Dieter Lehnhoff, Creaci√≥n musical en Guatemala.

The object of the game is to maneuver ones pieces around barriers and into the opponents starting spaces. The game is long out of production. History The game was invented by Philip Slater and published by Lakeside in 1975. The company went bankrupt in 1983 and ceased production. In fact, Philip Slater invented Cul-de-sac and Blockade around 1975. Here are some sources: Sources Video Blockade game : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZVwIz_uOeg Sources web game : http://www.pergioco.net/blockade.html ; https://www.spiele- check.de/10471-Blockade_Arxon.html ; http://jeuxsoc.fr/?principal=/jeu/bloc2 ; http://ludovox.fr/jeu-de-societe/blockade-1447/ ; https://www.jedisjeux.net/jeu-de-societe/blockade Gameplay and rules Two players are each given two pawns, nine green walls (which are placed vertically), and nine blue walls (placed horizontally). Pawns are placed on their starting locations on each of the four corners of the 11√ó14 board. One team's starting location is at [4,4] and [8,4] and the other at [4,11] and [8,11]. The object of the game is for each player to get both their pawns to the starting locations of their opponent. The first to do so wins. On each turn, a player moves one pawn one or two spaces (horizontally, vertically, or any combination of the two) and places one wall anywhere on the board (useful for blocking off their opponent's move). Walls always cover two squares and must be placed according to their color (vertically or horizontally). Pawns may jump over other pawns that are blocking their path. Once players are out of walls, they keep moving pawns until one wins.

Because it lives underground, it is white in color and eyeless. This species is threatened by the degradation of its urban habitat. Heavy metals have been detected in the area. Other forms of pollution could occur, such as oil spills, sewer leaks, and fertilizer runoff. Flooding may destroy individuals and remove the microhabitat they inhabit.

Early life Liz was born Mary Elizabeth Altemus in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania. She was the daughter of Elizabeth Dobson Altemus and Lemuel Coffin Altemus, a wealthy entrepreneur who made his success in the textile business. \\"Liz\\", as she would become known throughout her life, developed a love of horses and equestrian competitions at an early age. A 1939 TIME magazine article describes her as \\"a spirited, devil-may-care rider who has been winning blue ribbons on the horseshow circuit for 15 years\\" and whose \\"riding technique became the very pattern for aspiring horsewomen.\\"  Thoroughbred horse racing  Liz Altemus owned and raced Thoroughbred horses before she married. In 1930, her horse Capstone ran fifth in the inaugural running of the Wilson Stakes at Saratoga Race Course.After her marriage to Jock Whitney she remained active in Thoroughbred racing. She set up her own operations and made her Llangollen home a major breeding and training center, constructing a variety of equine fittings, including a famous horseshoe-shaped barn, stud barn and broodmare sheds, tack rooms, paddocks, and a training track on the property. In the 1930s, she owned a string of successful racehorses, winning the 1931 Adirondack Stakes with her filly Brocado and with Stepenfetchit, won the 1932 Latonia Derby and ran third in the Kentucky Derby. With her colt Singing Wood, Liz won the 1933 Belmont Futurity Stakes, the 1934 Withers Stakes and Queens County Handicap. In 1936, Singing Wood won the Toboggan Handicap at Belmont Park in Elmont and when her husband's business interest took the couple to Hollywood, the colt raced there and won the 1936 Santa Margarita Handicap. Following her divorce from Jock Whitney, TIME, in its March 1942 issue, reported that she planned to concentrate on racing and would sell all but one of her show horses. Nonetheless, she remained active in the sport for many years, racing horses in both flat racing and steeplechase events under the name of Llangollen Farm. She imported bloodstock from Europe for breeding purposes and over the years expanded operations to breed horses in Ocala, Florida and in Ireland. Whitney worked with notable trainers such as future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Henry S. Clark who got his first stakes win with her colt, Blue Cypress. Other trainers of note who conditioned Llangollen Farm horses were James W. Healy, Stanley T. Greene, Frank H. Merrill Jr. and another future Hall of Fame trainer Charlie Whittingham who ran her California stable. In 1953, Whittingham trained his first Champion in the form of her two-year-old colt, Porterhouse. She bred Sherluck, winner of the 1961 Belmont Stakes. Saratoga, New York She purchased a farm property on Fitch Road in the town of Saratoga, New York. The house, built in the 1770s, was used as her residence during the racing season at nearby Saratoga Race Course where many of America's horse racing elite gathered each summer. Sold in 1971, the property today is owned by McMahon of Saratoga Thoroughbreds, LLC. Her stable colors of purple and pink on farm structures in time have given way to the more modest colors for McMahon of green and white. Personal life Through her social standing and involvement with horses, Liz Altemus met and married John Hay \\"Jock\\" Whitney (1904‚Äì1982), a member of the extremely wealthy Whitney family of New York. Jock Whitney's grandfather, father and uncle were all heavily involved in Thoroughbred horse racing. They divorced in June 1940, and Liz retained the Virginia estate. In June 1948, she married for a second time to Dr. Edward Cooper Person Jr., a surgery professor, in Upperville. At the wedding, her matron of honor was Lillian Bostwick Phipps, the wife of Ogden Phipps, and her husband's best man was Dr. William Harding Jackson, the president of New York Hospital. He died in 1952. In November 1954, she married for the third time, to Richard Lunn (d. 1962), a forty-year-old public- relations man and step-son of U.S. Senator Wallace H. White, in Washington, D.C. They divorced five years later, and he died shortly thereafter in 1962. Her fourth, and final marriage, took place in 1960, and was to Col. Cloyce Joseph Tippett (1913‚Äì1993), who headed the Lima, Peru, office of the International Civil Aviation Organization. This marriage, her longest, lasted until her death in 1988. Tippett died of cancer in 1988 at Llangollen Farm. In 2004, she was inducted posthumously in the Virginia Thoroughbred Association Hall of Fame. Llangollen estate For their 1930 marriage, Jock Whitney bought his bride Llangollen estate, a large and historic property off Trappe Road west of Upperville, Virginia at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Eight miles from the village of Middleburg, the area had long been home to many horse farms and since the mid-19th century, a center for equestrian events. By the early part of the 20th century Thoroughbred breeding operations were gaining importance and in 1930, Liz Whitney would be one of the first of a number of prominent personalities in Thoroughbred horse racing who would develop substantial and important breeding operations. Others who came to the area include heiress Isabel Dodge Sloane, who built the highly successful Brookmeade Stud, the prestigious Rokeby Farm of Paul Mellon, Jack Kent Cooke's Kent Farms, and the Newstead Farm of Diana M. Firestone and her husband Bertram. Since the early 1960s, for two days each year more than ten horse farms and centers in Upperville and Middleburg open their gates to visitors. A prominent part of the hunt set, Liz Whitney was a member of the Upperville Colt and Horse Show for many years and has a place on the organizations Wall of Honor. At her Llangollen estate, Liz Whitney entertained celebrities and politicians as well as personalities involved in the racing world such as Bing Crosby, Eddie Arcaro and Prince Aly Khan. Always a free spirit, in a 2001 book titled The Middleburg Mystique, author Vicky Moon recounted how Whitney hosted wild hunt balls and of the time when she brought her favorite horse into the mansion's great room. Moon's book also says that she kept thirty-five dogs with the most beloved ones stored in her deep freezer after they died. Racehorses owned Some other successful racehorses owned by Liz Whitney Tippett included: * Corn Husker - won L. E.

The series went through a series of schedule changes, as ITV attempted to rebrand its weekday output, and episodes were broadcast on two consecutive nights of the week. The final episode won Cold Feet the BAFTA for Best Drama Series.  Episodes Production The final episode of the third series drew 9.1 million viewers, the highest audience figure for the programme. By then the fourth series was already in pre-production, and it was decided by the production crew and the cast that the show should end after the fourth to stop it from \\"going stale\\". Fay Ripley left Cold Feet during this series, not wishing to spend months away from her home filming the series. She believed Jenny had nowhere left to go in terms of character development, having already given birth to a child and separated from Pete. During the development stage of this series, she encouraged Bullen to write Jenny out by severely maiming her, though they both came to the agreement that Jenny would take a job in New York, leaving open the possibility that she could return in the future.Smith, p.76 To fill Ripley's place in the cast, the producers scouted for a new actress. Spencer Campbell went to Los Angeles and auditioned former Home and Away actress Kimberley Joseph, who was looking for work in America. Campbell soon hired her as Jo Ellison. Bullen had originally planned for Jo to be a \\"big fat truck- driving lesbian type\\", but the character was toned down when he met Joseph.Smith, pp. 170 ‚Äì 171 Victoria Smurfit reprised her role as Jane Fitzpatrick for two episodes, while Sean Pertwee joined the series in the recurring role of Mark Cubbit for the last four episodes. Baxendale did not appear in the sixth episode, filmed in July and August; she took time off filming during the late stage of her pregnancy. Rachel's absence was explained away by having her visiting Jenny in New York.Smith, pp. 193 ‚Äì 195 Despite it being established in the third series that Rachel was unable to conceive a child because of her abortion, Helen Baxendale's pregnancy meant a \\"twist\\" was needed in the plot, and the apparently miraculous conception was worked into the storyline. Initially, the pregnancy was to be revealed in the sixth episode, but when Baxendale began showing early, the plot was moved forward by two episodes.Smith, pp. 12 ‚Äì 13 Bullen wrote a scene showing the social worker crying after turning down Adam and Rachel's adoption application to show a positive portrayal of the profession, against what appeared in media at the time. While taking advantage of the location for filming, the eighth episode was written as a normal episode \\"about [the] characters who happened to be in Australia\\". The breakup of the Giffords' and Marsdens' marriages allowed Bullen to combine different characters in scenes who aren't often seen together, in particular the third episode, which saw Pete and Karen clubbing together. By this series Bullen was writing the characters as more like the actors who played them, compared to basing them on his friends as he did when Cold Feet began. Filming was scheduled between April and October 2001, though did not begin until late May. Spencer Campbell produced episodes 1‚Äì3 and 7‚Äì8 and Emma Benson, a script supervisor on previous series, produced the other four. Between the third and fourth series, Bullen and Harries did a speaking tour in the Far East and Australia, where they decided to work a trip to Sydney into the storyline for no reason other than it was \\"a nice place to go\\". The main cast, Pertwee and a skeleton production crew were flown out to Sydney to film on location, filming for 18 days in Sydney in October 2001. A local film crew was hired as flying the regular production crew to Australia would have been prohibitively expensive. A stunt team co-ordinated the fight scene between Mark and David, but could not convincingly choreograph a headbutt between Mark and David. Pertwee, already experienced in stunt fighting, and the stunt coordinator agreed Pertwee would get a better reaction from Bathurst by almost hitting him straight on his face, instead of \\"hitting air\\". Bad scheduling meant the time for filming in Manchester ran out, so scenes depicting the characters at Manchester Airport were shot in Sydney. Banners promoting the 2002 Commonwealth Games were hung up for authenticity. Scenes featuring Rachel's hotel room were shot at the Lowry Hotel in Salford, while the exteriors used the GMEX Centre. Broadcast In an effort to draw the ABC1 demographic to Sunday nights, ITV's director of channels David Liddiment moved the series from Sunday to Monday, replacing it with two \\"upmarket\\" dramas. Shortly before the first episode was broadcast, it was rescheduled to both Sunday and Monday nights to compete with a BBC costume drama and Dalziel and Pascoe. Reception The first episode had 8.9 million viewers, beating a BBC One adaptation of The Way We Live Now. Episodes shown on Monday had lower ratings than the Sunday episodes, averaging only 6.9 million, due to the scheduling of the game show Shafted as a lead-in. ITV moved Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? to Shafted's timeslot and Cold Feet's ratings picked up, with the eighth episode getting 8.5 million and a 37% share. The fifth episode was the series highest rated episode, with final ratings of 9.87 million, making it the 13th most-watched drama of the year. Comparing the series to The Way We Live Now, Andrew Billen wrote in the Evening Standard that Cold Feet was \\"the real way we live now\\", citing the emotional relationships in the series as examples of real-life behaviour. Despite this, the series was regarded as not on par with previous ones; Billen wrote in New Statesman that the series was \\"running on half a tank\\" and James Nesbitt said it \\"wasn't great\\". The series was awarded the BAFTA for Best Drama Series for the wedding episode and Most Popular Comedy Programme at the National Television Awards. The scene in which Pete meets Rod for the first time was voted \\"Best Dramatic Moment\\" at the BBC's annual \\"TV Moments\\" ceremony in 2002.

Life Born in Guatemala City to German settlers, 1955, Dieter Lehnhoff Temme has been a pupil of Klaus Ager, Gerhard Wimberger, Josef Maria Horv√°th, and Dr. Friedrich C. Heller in Salzburg. His musique concr√©te work Requiem was premiered in 1975 at the Austrian Broadcasting (ORF). He earned his master's (M.A.) and doctoral (Ph.D.) degrees with distinction at the Benjamin T. Rome School of Music of The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he was a graduate student of Conrad Bernier and Helmut Braunlich (composition), Donald Thulean (conducting), Cyrilla Barr, Ruth Steiner, and Robert M. Stevenson (musicology). Recent works His original compositions have been performed in Europe and the Americas. His Misa de San Isidro (2001) for a cappella chorus was premiered in Tenerife, the Canary Islands, Spain, in 2002, and has been performed by different professional choirs at festivals in Medell√≠n, Tokyo, and New York City. His Piano Concerto No. 1 (2005), dedicated to the Russian pianist and teacher, Alexandr Sklioutovski, was premiered in June, 2006 at the National Theatre in Guatemala City by Jos√© Pablo Quesada as soloist and the Millennium Orchestra, the composer conducting. In 2007, it was performed to critical acclaim and great enthusiasm at the National Theatre in San Jos√©, Costa Rica, again with pianist Quesada and the composer conducting the National University Symphony Orchestra. Quesada also performed it at the 15th Latin American Music Festival in Caracas, Venezuela in May, 2008, with the National Philharmonic Orchestra of Venezuela. Lehnhoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 (2007) was very successfully premiered in August, 2008 in Guatemala City by concert pianist Sergio Sand√≠, with the combined Millennium Orchestra and Bachensemble Leipzig, the composer conducting. The concertos are written in a personal, highly original post-modern style in which contemporary art-music idioms and techniques, but also blues, tango, and jazz influences can be traced. His aphoristical twelve-tone Hai-kai for piano have attracted the attention of scholars such as the distinguished musicologist Dr. Tamara Sklioutovskaia, and have been performed by international pianists. His piano and chamber music has been performed at numerous festivals in Europe, North- and South America. His diptych Escenas primigenias was published on CD and served as a model for cinematic development. His stage work in progress Satuy√©, on an own multilingual libretto, is about the Afro-Caribbean Garinagu (or Garifuna) people and their arrival at Central American shores. Revival of historical music His research of the Music of Guatemala has revealed a previously unknown musical wealth, including the Maya, Renaissance, baroque, classical, romantic, 20th century, and current trends. From the early 1980s on, Dieter Lehnhoff had become interested in searching for music composed in Central America and specifically Guatemala during the Spanish rule (1524‚Äì1821). His research initiatives brought to light a number of compositions by Renaissance masters Hernando Franco, Pedro Berm√∫dez, and Gaspar Fern√°ndez, as well as Guatemalan baroque composers Manuel Jos√© de Quir√≥s, Rafael Antonio Castellanos, Pedro Antonio Rojas, and Jos√© Eulalio Samayoa. A first anthology was published in Antigua Guatemala in 1984. The music was revived in a number of concerts conducted by Lehnhoff, thus surprising the musical world with a new repertoire of high quality. The first series of digital recordings (1992‚Äì99), which spanned from the late Maya times to the end of the 20th century, was released as part of the monumental Historia General de Guatemala, an encyclopedic publication in six volumes written by over 150 specialists in every historical area. The series of seven CDs included premiere recordings of music from every historical period. The revival of the historic Music of Guatemala through Lehnhoff's concerts, writings, and recordings had a significant effect on the strengthening of the cultural identity of Guatemalans in times of civil confrontation and turmoil. The dissemination of his musical and historical findings at more than 40 international festivals, concerts, congresses, and meetings also helped to restore the cultural image and prestige of the country. As a conductor, he has founded and directed various instrumental groups, orchestras, and choral groups. He has been invited to perform as a conductor, composer, lecturer, or leader of his Millennium Ensemble at over forty international festivals and concerts in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Germany, Guatemala, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Spain, the United States, and Venezuela. He has produced a series of compact discs with premiere recordings of works by Guatemalan composers of all times. Academic programmes In the academic field he also pioneered by establishing and directing several institutions and programmes devoted to the strengthening of musical culture in Guatemala. Thus, he proposed and carried out the design and establishment of the Music Department at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, which offered, for the first time in the country, a Bachelor's degree and a teaching license in Music. He also established the Institute of Musicology at the Universidad Rafael Land√≠var , which is under his direction, and which is primarily devoted to musicological research. He has taught numerous courses in musicology, music theory, applied music, and composition. He has also been an invited professor at the doctoral programme of the National University of Costa Rica. For his extensive writings he was made a corresponding member of the Royal Spanish Academy, being also invited to join the Academies of History of Argentina, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, Spain, Uruguay, and Venezuela. He is founder and president of the Guatemalan Music Council, affiliated to the International Music Council.

In 2006 his death while in the custody of Portland law enforcement officers caused an outcry over civil rights and an examination of the lack of mental health crisis management training given to Portland police officers. At the time of his death, he was living in an apartment in downtown Portland and had been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Death James Chasse, surrounded by police and medical personnel. He would later die of the injuries inflicted during his arrest. Chasse died after a physical confrontation with two Portland Police officers and a Multnomah County deputy on September 17, 2006. Officers at the scene described Chasse as a homeless person and said that he ran away from them and fought with them. He was beaten and a Taser was employed multiple times on him. After the incident, Chasse was cleared medically by fire and ambulance personnel. He was then restrained and driven to jail, where nursing staff refused to admit him because of his injuries. The officers were told by jail staff to drive him to a hospital across town. He died en route. Chasse suffered fractures in 16 of his ribs and had a total of 26 broken bones, as well as a punctured lung, broken collar bone and torn spleen. The Multnomah County Medical Examiner ruled the cause of death to be both \\"accidental\\" and the result of \\"blunt force trauma\\". Over 500 friends and family members remembered Chasse at a candlelight vigil and memorial on October 14, 2006. Reports After three years and public pressure, the Portland Police Bureau released an internal investigation on the death of James Chasse. The investigation included six items, a \\"detective notebook\\" with six photos by witness Jamie Marquez, two separate two page disciplinary letters to Portland Police officers Kyle Nice and Christopher Humphreys, suspending them for 80 hours without pay. Both were disciplined for unacceptable conduct, violation of Taser policy. After arbitration in July 2012 with the police union, both letters were revoked and Nice and Humphreys were repaid for time lost. \\"IAD\\" or \\"Internal Affairs Division\\" is a 389-page report including witness, expert and officer interviews, case chronology and exhibits. Detectives included Portland's training manual about mental illness, and a 623-page narrative (archived here in three parts) review of Chasse's killing with redacted training materials. The city's auditor commissioned an investigation on the investigation of the death of James Chasse in July 2010. Public outcry Chasse's death produced an outcry in the Oregon media, with hundreds of news stories, editorials and front page articles following the case, and from civil rights and health advocates. Although Multnomah County District Attorney Michael Schrunk failed to bring an indictment against the officers, he did release all testimony presented to the grand jury. Portland mayor Tom Potter apologized to the Chasse family, convened a Mental Health Task Force to review the city's policies, and implemented a crisis intervention training program to improve the way in which city and county police respond to situations involving mental illness, but failed to discipline the officers who beat Chasse: Kyle Nice, Christopher Humphreys and Bret Barton.

To qualify as an application (rather than simply as a data warehousing tool), these tools should promote some form of automation. The maturity level of this automation is as follows: * reading data from a nominated operational system (ERP, CRM, SCM, etc.) into a data warehouse optimized for analysis (data led automation), * reports, dashboards and scorecards based on that data structure (reporting led automation), * what-if analysis and scenario-modeling (predictive or analytic led automation).

This location, particularly on Strawberry Spit, is a winter haul-out area for the Harbor seal. Pressures of urban development at Strawberry Point along with increases in small boat traffic have diminished the use of this lagoon for seal haul out, noted as early as 1990. Harbor seal presence The entire Harbor seal population of the San Francisco Bay has been estimated at approximately 500 individuals, of which up to 100 animals have been observed within Strawberry Lagoon, hauling out at Strawberry Spit.

An Earth Metrics Inc. study of 1990 provided for more protection of the seals by constructing an earthen berm on the southern part of Sanctuary Island and landscaping this area with shrubby native grasses to provide enhanced privacy for the Harbor seals.

Kiely also won junior championship honours with Brickey Rangers and √âire √ìg. Inter-county Kiely first came to prominence on the Waterford senior inter-county team in the late 1940s. He played in the first round of the Munster Championship in 1948, however, in spite of no further appearances that year, he was still eligible to receive both Munster and All-Ireland medals following Waterford's victories over Cork and Dublin respectively. It would be 1957 before Kiely won his first Munster title on the field of play. Waterford later played Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final, however, victory went to the men from Leinster on that occasion. The team would later come to rue this defeat as an All-Ireland title that they should have won. Waterford lost their provincial crown in 1958, however, the team bounced back in 1959 with Kiely collecting a second Munster title. Once again Waterford subsequently lined out in the championship decider and, once again, Kilkenny provided the opposition. The game ended in a draw, however, when the two sides met for the replay a few weeks later the men from Waterford made no mistake in defeating their near rivals and Kiely collected his first All-Ireland medal on the field of play.

After selling his magazine, Burkhardt moved in 1996 to Los Angeles to commence an acting career. He signed a contract with a Talent Agency and was coached by Ivana Chubbuck and Robert Easton. But thanks to a feature in a film magazine he got his first modelling job. More modelling work awaited him in Milan, New York, Tokyo, Paris and London. He became Newcomer of the Year, working for labels such as Prada, Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana and Moschino.

At club level he played for Erin‚Äôs Own, captaining the club on a number of occasions, and was the captain of the Waterford senior hurling team that won the 1948 All-Ireland Championship. Widely regarded as one of the Erin's Own club's all-time greats, Ware's career lasted for over twenty years. During that time he won 12 Waterford Senior Championship medals, including a record nine championships in-a-row between 1927 and 1935. Ware made his first appearance for the Waterford senior hurling team during the 1927 Munster Championship and enjoyed his greatest successes as a goalkeeper over the following two decades. In 1948, at the age of 40, he became the oldest player to lift the Liam MacCarthy Cup when Waterford won their first All-Ireland Championship, having earlier captained the team to the Munster Championship title. Ware was selected as goalkeeper on the Waterford Hurling Team of the Century in 1984. Ware's brother, Charlie, played on the first Waterford team to reach an All-Ireland final in 1938, while his nephew, also called Charlie, was a substitute on the Waterford team that won the 1959 All-Ireland Championship. Early life James Patrick Ware was born on 23 February 1908, at 84 Barrett's Buildings in Gurranabraher on the northside of Cork, to Mary (Murphy) Ware (1875-1937) and Charles Ware (1869-1947), a shoemaker. Both his parents were Corkonians, however, the family moved to Waterford shortly after Ware's birth. He was educated at the De La Salle College. Playing career=Erin's Own In 1924, Ware joined the newly-established Erin's Own club. Just four years later, he was goalkeeper on the Erin's Own team that won their first Waterford Senior Championship after an 8-02 to 0-05 defeat of reigning champions Dungarvan. It was the first of nine consecutive championship titles for the club, with Ware lining out in goal for all the subsequent victories over Tallow (1928, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1935), Lismore (1929), Dungarvan (1930) and Dunhill (1933). Ware won his 10th championship medal, after a lapse of seven years, on 18 October 1942 after a defeat of Lismore in the final. Ware ended his club career by winning back-to-back championship title in 1946 and 1947 after defeats of Brickey Rangers and Clonea. Waterford Ware made his first championship appearance for Waterford on 29 May 1927 in a Munster Championship semi-final against Clare. After one of the forward missed a last- minute goal chance to equalise the game, Waterford lost by 8-01 to 6-05. On 11 August 1929, Ware lined out in goal in his first Munster Championship final. Cork were the opponents and, in spite of having home advantage, Waterford were still defeated by 4-06 to 2-03. It was the first of five Munster final defeats for Ware. Ware captained Waterford for the first time on 13 June 1943 in a Munster Championship first round defeat of Tipperary at Fraher Field. He was reappointed captain of the team for the 1947 and 1948 championship campaigns. On 1 August 1948, Ware won his only Munster Championship medal when Waterford defeated reigning champions Cork by 4-07 to 3-09 in the final at Thurles Sportsfield. He came in for individual praise after making a number of spectacular saves. On 5 September 1948, Ware became the first Waterford player and the oldest player to lift the Liam MacCarthy Cup after a 6-07 to 4-02 defeat of Dublin in the All-Ireland final. Ware played his last game for Waterford on 12 June 1949 in a 3-08 to 3-03 Munster Championship semi-final defeat by Limerick. Munster At the age of 35, Ware was first selected as goalkeeper for the Munster inter-provincial team. On 17 March 1944, he won his first Railway Cup medal after a 4-10 to 4-04 defeat of Connacht in the final at Croke Park. A year later, Ware won a second successive Railway Cup medal after a 6-08 to 2-00 defeat of Ulster. In 1949, Ware was appointed captain of the Munster team. He won his third and final Railway Cup medal on 17 March 1949 after a 5-03 to 2-09 defeat of Connacht. Personal life Ware married Alice O'Donnell (28 April 1912 - 8 June 1998), a poet and playwright, at the Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity in Waterford on 24 September 1938. They had three daughters - Colette, Christine and Catherine. Ware worked as a bookbinder at Harvey's for nearly 55 years until his retirement in 1978. Ware died at Ardkeen Hospital in Waterford on 18 July 1983.

Semi-elective surgery is a surgery that must be done to preserve the patient's life, but does not need to be performed immediately. By contrast, an urgent surgery is one that can wait until the patient is medically stable, but should generally be done within 2 days, and an emergency surgery is one that must be performed without delay; the patient has no choice other than immediate surgery if permanent disability or death is to be avoided. Types Most surgeries necessary for medical reasons are elective, that is, scheduled at a time to suit the surgeon, hospital, and patient. These include inguinal hernia surgery, cataract surgery, mastectomy for breast cancer, and the donation of a kidney by a living donor. Elective surgeries include all optional surgeries performed for non-medical reasons. This includes cosmetic surgery, such as facelifts, breast implants, liposuction, and breast reduction, which aim to subjectively improve a patient's physical appearance. LASIK procedures can be elective, where a patient weighs the risks against increased quality of life expectations. LASIK is currently the top elective surgery in the United States. Preparation Preoperative carbohydrates may decrease amount of time spent in hospital recovering. Urgency When a condition is worsening but has not yet reached the point of a true emergency, surgeons speak of semi-elective surgery: the peccant part must be dealt with, but a delay is not expected to affect the outcome. In a patient with multiple medical conditions, problems classified as needing semi- elective surgeries may be postponed until emergent conditions have been addressed and the patient is medically stable. For example, whenever possible, pregnant women typically postpone all elective and semi-elective procedures until after giving birth. In some situations, an urgently needed surgery will be postponed briefly to permit even more urgent conditions to be addressed. In other situations, emergency surgery may be performed at the same time as life- saving resuscitation efforts. Semi-elective procedures are typically scheduled within a time frame deemed appropriate for the patient's condition and disease. Removal of a malignancy, for example, is usually scheduled as semi- elective surgery, to be performed within a set number of days or weeks. Urgent surgery is typically performed with 48 hours of diagnosis. Emergency surgery is performed as soon as a surgeon is available. Many surgeries can be performed as either elective or emergency surgeries, depending on the patient's needs. A sudden worsening of gallbladder disease may require immediate removal of the gallbladder by emergency surgery, but this surgery is more commonly scheduled in advance. An appendectomy is considered emergency surgery, but depending upon how early the diagnosis was made, the patient may have more time before the appendix risks rupturing or the infection spreads. Also, in certain emergency conditions, even ones like a heart attack or stroke, surgery may or may not need to be utilized.

Walsh made his first appearance for the team during the 1956 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement after the 1970 championship. During that time he won one All-Ireland medal, three Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. In 1959 Walsh captained the team to the All- Ireland title. At club level Walsh enjoyed a lengthy career with Mount Sion, winning twelve county club championship. In retirement from playing Walsh became involved in team management. He trained the Waterford senior hurling team in the early 1970s before later serving as manager of the Mount Sion senior hurling team in the early 1990s. Biography Frankie Walsh was born in the city of Waterford in 1936. He showed a great interest in the game of hurling and was hugely influenced by the great John Keane, a distant relative, and others from the 1948 All-Ireland winning team. The year after this great victory Walsh began hurling with Mount Sion CBS in the street leagues in the city. He captured his very first medal that same year when defeating Roanmore in the street league final. In 1953 Walsh was a member of the Mount Sion team that competed in the Dr. Harty Cup competition. Mount Sion defeated St. Flannans College of Ennis in the final to take the title. Walsh later worked as a welder in his native Waterford. Playing career=Club Walsh played his club hurling and football with the Mount Sion club and enjoyed much success in a career that spanned three decades. After winning a county minor championship medal in 1953, Walsh joined the Mount Sion senior hurling team in 1954. That year the club won the championship after a defeat of Erin's Own, however, Walsh was an unused substitute and didn't receive a medal. By 1955 Walsh was a regular member of the Mount Sion starting fifteen. A 2‚Äì10 to 3‚Äì4 defeat of Abbeyside gave Walsh his first championship medal on the field of play. It was the first of seven successive championships for Walsh as Mount Sion continued to dominated club hurling in Waterford. During this period Walsh also lined out with the Mount Sion senior football team. In 1956 he won his first championship medal as Dungarvan by 3‚Äì2 to 2‚Äì4. Three years later in 1959 Walsh added a second championship medal to his collection as De La Salle were accounted for. He won his third and final football championship medal in 1961 as Stardbally were defeated by 3‚Äì5 to 2‚Äì3. A record-breaking ten-in-a-row proved beyond the Mount Sion hurling team as Erin's Own bested them in the championship decider of 1962. In spite of this Walsh's side bounced back the following year to record a 4‚Äì6 to 3‚Äì4 defeat of Ballygunner. The victory began another great run of success as further defeats of Abbeyside and Ballygunner gave Mount Sion a hat-trick of championship titles. After several years out of the limelight, Mount Sion returned to the top of the championship pile once again in 1969. A huge 7‚Äì11 to 2‚Äì13 defeat of Abbeyside gave Walsh his eleventh championship medal. Three years later Walsh was in the twilight of his club hurling career as Mount Sion reached the championship decider. A 2‚Äì10 to 2‚Äì8 defeat of Dunhill gave Mount Sion the title and gave Walsh a remarkable twelfth championship medal. Inter-county Walsh first came to prominence at inter-county level as a member of the Waterford minor hurling team, however, he had little success in this grade. He subsequently made his debut for the senior team in a National Hurling League relegation game against Kilkenny and later made his championship debut against Cork in 1956. Ironically, Walsh's first championship game could easily have been his last as he received a fractured skull from a swinging hurley. In spite of his injury Walsh was back on the team again in 1957. That year he lined out in his first provincial decider with reigning champions Cork providing the opposition. Waterford were the underdogs going into the game, however, at the long whistle Walsh ended up with a Munster medal following a 1‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì6 victory. The men from the D√©ise later lined out in the All-Ireland final with Kilkenny providing the opposition. Over 70,000 spectators turned up at Croke Park to see an exciting game of hurling. With fifteen minutes left in the game Waterford led by six points. Two quick goals for \\"the Cats\\", together with a great point by captain Mickey Kelly reversed the trend and gave Kilkenny a 4‚Äì10 to 3‚Äì12 victory. Waterford lost their provincial crown in 1958 but the team bounced back in 1959 with Walsh, who was now captain of the side, collecting a second Munster medal following a 3‚Äì9 to 2‚Äì9 win over Cork. Once again Waterford subsequently lined out in the championship decider and, once again, Kilkenny provided the opposition. The game was another exciting affair and with ninety seconds left in the game Kilkenny were ahead by three points. Just then S√©amus Power scored the equalising goal to force a 1‚Äì17 to 5‚Äì5 draw. The replay was another great game with both sides giving it their all. Waterford scored three goals in the opening thirty minutes while Walsh scored a spectacular eighth point to help his side to a 3‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì10 win. It was his first, and only, All-Ireland medal while he also had the honour of collecting the Liam MacCarthy Cup. Four years later in 1963 Walsh added a National Hurling League medal to his collection before winning a third Munster title following a victory over the great Tipperary team of the decade. For the third successive time Kilkenny turned out to be Waterford's opponents in the subsequent All-Ireland final. Things weren't going well for Walsh's side and at one stage Waterford were eleven points in arrears. The men from the D√©ise clawed back this deficit to two points but an expert display by Eddie Keher proved the difference as Kilkenny won by 4‚Äì17 to 6‚Äì8. Walsh continued playing with Waterford until 1970. Inter-provincial Walsh also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition and enjoyed much success. He first lined out with his province in 1957 and collected a Railway Cup medal that year as Munster defeated arch-rivals Leinster. Walsh was captain of the side in 1960 as Leinster were accounted for again in Railway Cup final. It was the first of two in-a-row for the southern province and for Walsh. After defeat in 1962 he collected two more Railway Cup medals in 1963 and 1966.

The Montana Railroad was an American railroad built and operated between the towns of Lombard and Lewistown, Montana, a distance of approximately 157 miles. The railroad connected with the national railway network via a connection with the Northern Pacific Railway at Lombard. The Montana Railroad line was constructed between 1895 and 1903, and operated independently until 1908, when it was acquired by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (\\"the Milwaukee Road\\"). The railroad was colloquially known as \\"the Jawbone\\", because of the contrast between the promising statements of the line's promoters and the company's perennially-weak financial position. History The Montana Railroad was the brainchild of Richard A. Harlow, a Helena, Montana attorney and entrepreneur, who envisioned the construction of a railway eastward from Helena to serve the mining and agricultural regions of central Montana. His first attempt at such a project, the Montana Midland, began construction in 1893, but almost immediately failed due to the onset of the Panic of 1893. Undeterred, in 1894 Harlow organized the Montana Railroad, a project with similar goals. Construction work on the Montana Railroad began in 1895 at Lombard, a station on the Northern Pacific Railway 53 miles east of Helena. The Montana Railroad route proceeded eastward from Lombard up Sixteen Mile Canyon towards the mining districts of the Castle Mountains, in southeastern Meagher County. The railroad reached Leadborough, at the southern end of the mining district, in November 1896; unfortunately for the railroad, however, the region's mines were already past their peak by then. In the face of the declining mineral production in the Castle area, Harlow realized that his railroad needed a larger and more diversified traffic base. He therefore announced plans to extend his railroad still farther, and in 1899 railway construction crews began working eastward down the Musselshell River valley. The Montana Railroad was completed to the new town of Harlowton (named after Harlow) in 1900. The line's tracklayers then turned northward, finally reaching Lewistown in 1903. In 1908, the Montana Railroad was purchased by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, which was then in the process of constructing a new transcontinental line through the state of Montana. The Lombard-Harlowton segment of the Montana Railroad became a part of this new Milwaukee line, although nearly all of the original route was heavily rebuilt, to reduce curvature and raise the Sixteen Mile Canyon trackage above the flood-prone canyon floor. Work to electrify the line began in 1914. The Montana's Harlowton-Lewistown route became a secondary main line for the Milwaukee; it was later extended to Great Falls and several branch lines were built. Nearly all of the Milwaukee Road's trackage in the area was abandoned in 1980, and today only a short segment of the former Montana Railroad (near Moore) remains in service. Most of the former grade can still be seen, however. Scenes from the line, including steam trains, are captured in the 1930 film Danger Lights. The landslide scene is said to have been recorded in 16 Mile Canyon east of Lombard. This section required heavy engineering with many bridges and tunnels but the exact location of the scene remains a mystery.

Geographic range Found in the United States in eastern Kansas, extreme southeastern Nebraska and a large part of Missouri. The type locality given is \\"10 miles south of McLouth, Jefferson County, Kansas.\\" Venom The venom of Agkistrodon contortrix phaeogaster is similar to the venoms produced by other species of the Agkistrodon genus. The exact ratio of toxins to each other varies among species and gender, as does the overall potency of the venom (the ratio of active toxins to other constituents of the venom). The venom is most potent between the late-spring and mid-summer months, this rise in toxicity commences 2‚Äì3 weeks prior to reaching peak toxicity. While the initial reduction of potency occurs over approximately one month, the snake's venom remains slightly more toxic throughout the late-summer months until beginning a slow descent to reach its original toxicity by mid-fall. Danger to humans The bite of the Osage copperhead is considered a medical emergency and the victim should be brought to a hospital immediately for the best prognosis (an ambulance should be called if the victim is alone, as driving is highly dangerous after an envenomation). The effects of the toxic venom present with a predictable course of symptoms until treatment is received. Immediate and severe pain, oozing of blood from the fang punctures, considerable edema, epistaxis, bleeding of the gums, marked hematuria, general petechiae, shock, renal failure, and local necrosis. These effects are attributed to the various haemotoxins and necrotoxins contained in the venom. Many other toxins are present in the venom in small quantities and are not clinically significant due to their extremely low concentrations. Treatment CroFab antivenin has been used successfully to treat Osage copperhead bites, although a lack of complete cross-tolerance requires careful administration and close supervision during the full course of treatment to ensure that the lowest effective dose is administered (a lower dose would not fully treat the envenomation, and a higher dose may be particularly dangerous to children, the elderly, and infirm adults). Not uncommonly, opiate/opioid narcotic analgesics (ex. morphine, fentanyl), muscle relaxerss (ex. diazepam, tizanidine, orphenadrine), and broad-spectrum antibiotics are administered. A few days' supply of weaker analgesics and muscle relaxers may be prescribed for the patient to control pain after he or she returns home as the pain resolves completely within one to three days. Patients also receive a prescription for an intensive antibiotic therapy, which much be taken until the supplies are depleted, giving the drug enough time to fully treat any opportunistic infections resulting from the bite wounds or other transmission methods which the victim's weakened immune system cannot defend against. Failing to take the antibiotics until the prescription is depleted can cause the bacteria to \\"rebound\\" in a new form, possessing a greater resistance to antibiotics (MRSA developed through this process). Antivenin availability CroFab antivenin is effective in treating A. c. phaeogaster bites, but it may cause severe anaphylactic shock and should not be used in any individuals allergic to anything contained within the formula, unless the allergy is limited to nonlethal grievances such as rashes and itching. One other exception to this occurs when the envenomation is so severe that the victims' doctors determine this risk of death from envenomation outweighs the risk of inducing anaphylaxis in a critically ill patient. A major shortage of CroFab existed in the U.S., and the vials which are available are exorbitantly priced, leading many doctors to negate the use of the antivenin in many patients whose bite resulted in extreme suffering, but does not present any life-threatening symptoms (in these situations, palliative care and symptomatic/supportive treatment approaches are used, instead).

It is found in coastal marine and brackish waters, and tolerates colder temperatures than the other Asian horseshoe crabs (Tachypleus gigas and Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda), although juveniles still need water warmer than to moult. Description Horseshoe crabs are not crabs at all, but are most closely related to spiders and scorpions, and may even be arachnids themselves. The cephalothorax is protected by this single large, horseshoe-shaped plate, and neither it nor the abdomen is visibly segmented. The tail bears a long spike, known as the telson. Like other horseshoe crabs, the carapace of T. tridentatus consists of a larger frontal one (the prosoma) and a smaller, spine-edged rear one (the opisthosoma). There are six pairs of prosomal appendages/legs, consisting of a small frontal pair in front of the mouth and five larger walking/pushing legs on either side of the mouth. The book gills are located on the underside of the opisthosoma. Both the common name tri- spine horseshoe crab and the scientific name tridentatus refer to the three small spiny processes on the rear part of the opisthosoma (one spine in the middle above the tail and one on either side), while other species only have a single spine (in the middle). The tri-spine horseshoe crab is the largest of the living horseshoe crab species. Like the other species, females grow larger than males. The largest females of the tri-spine horseshoe crab can be as much as long, including their tail. On average in Sabah, Malaysia, females are about long, including a tail that is about , and their carapace (prosoma) is about wide. In comparison, the average for males is about long, including a tail that is about , and their carapace is about wide. There are significant geographic variations in the size, but this does not follow a clear north‚Äìsouth or east‚Äìwest pattern. The largest are from the Kota Kinabalu region in Malaysia where the average carapace width is about and in females and males respectively. The smallest are from Zhoushan region in China where the average carapace width is about and in females and males respectively. Intermediate average sizes, ranging from in females and in males, have been reported from Imari in Japan, Xiamen in China, the Philippines, and Manado, Tarakan, Padang and Sibolga in Indonesia. Females typically reach maturity at a carapace width of about and males at . Females weigh and males . In addition to the difference in size, males' two front pairs of walking legs, prosomal appendages two and three, have hooks (they are scissor-like in females) and they have six (three in females) long spines on either side of the rear carapace. Juveniles (both sexes) also have six long spines on either side, similar to adult males. From the eggs hatch to adulthood takes 4 years and involves 15 instar phases (14 moults). Ecology Mating pair, with the smaller male having grasped the larger female Like other species of horseshoe crabs, T. tridentatus is an omnivore and feeds on molluscs, worms, other benthic invertebrates and algae. Large batches of eggs are laid in holes dug in sandy beaches in special nursery areas off the coast. On hatching, the larvae remain in the nest over winter, feeding on the yolks of their eggs for several months, remaining in this nursery area during the next spring and summer. As juveniles they remain buried in the sediment during high tide, emerging at low tide to feed on the exposed surface. They have limited opportunities to disperse widely. Adults move offshore for the winter, hibernating buried in the seabed at depths of around , coming inshore again when the water warms up the following year. As a poikilotherm, this horseshoe crab is much affected by rising seawater temperatures, reacting by burying itself deeply in the sediment and sometimes going into diapause. Status Female The tri-spine horseshoe crab are at risk from over-fishing, pollution and the loss of their breeding grounds. Populations have declined for decades, and the species was granted protection in Japan in 1928. In China it has become less common and, from being once abundant in Taiwan, it is now seldom seen inshore there. As of 2019, the International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies the species as \\"Endangered\\" based on recent population and habitat declines.

AFNSEP's eight-person ACCE team coordinated all Air Force, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units helping with firefighting efforts. AFNSEP also dispatched six C-130 Hercules aircraft which dumped over 3,000 gallons of fire retardant on blazes, to help with the firefighting effort. (Reported by Maj. Gen. Hank Morrow, AFNORTH Cmdr.) Background The AFNSEP program was originally developed due to President Ronald Reagan's 1988 Executive Order 12656. This order identified a need to expand the military's role beyond defense to responding to national emergencies and supporting civilian needs in natural disasters. Since their formation, AFNSEP has supported more than 125 major disasters, including the 1989 Exxon Valdez Oil Spill, several California wildfires, the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, several hurricanes to include Andrew and Katrina, and typhoon relief across the United States and the Pacific region. After Hurricane Katrina, AFNSEP was re-aligned to, according to an order issued by the Secretary of the Air Force, more closely support civilian authorities during times of national emergencies and disasters by allowing more contiguous command, control and support from US Air Force forces. Operations The role of AFNSEP is to train and deploy Emergency Preparedness Liaison Officers (EPLO). EPLOs are normally senior Air Force Reserve Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) officers, who coordinate military assistance to federal agencies and state government when homeland support is requested. NASA support AFNORTH provided the manpower for U.S. Northern Command's Joint Task Force-Space Transportation System, responsible for the search and rescue of NASA astronauts and recovery of or crisis response of the Space Shuttle.

It was discovered by Swiss myrmecologist Heinrich Kutter. The species is unusual for lacking a worker caste, the queens and males living entirely off the care of the pavement ant. It has been called \\"the 'ultimate' parasitic ant\\" by myrmecologists Edward O. Wilson and Bert H√∂lldobler. Taxonomy Kutter described the species in 1950, naming it Teleutomyrmex schneideri and designating it the type species of its newly-circumscribed genus. He named it after his teacher and friend Otto Schneider-Orelli. Kutter discovered the holotype himself; the species's type locality is Saas-Fee, Valais, Switzerland. The genus name, \\"Teleutomyrmex\\", meant \\"last\\" or \\"final\\" ant. In a 2015 revision of the subfamily Myrmicinae, Philip S. Ward, Se√°n G. Brady, Brian L. Fisher, and Ted R. Schultz classified the genus Teleutomyrmex as a junior synonym of Tetramorium. They created a nomen novum for this species, T. inquilinum, due to the presence of a senior homonym: Tetramorium schneideri ; Carlo Emery had named this species after a different individual, Oskar Schneider, who had collected the holotype. Ward and colleagues' replacement specific epithet refers to the species's inquiline behavior (). This synonymy is contested by some myrmecologists, on the basis of the monophyly of the Teleutomyrmex complex and its very specific biology. Distribution This species has been found in the Swiss Alps, the French Alps, the French Pyrenees, Spain, and Turkmenistan. Morphology The body shape of Tetramorium inquilinum is specifically adapted. The queens average 2.5 mm in length, and have a concave form and large pads and claws. Tetramorium inquilinum is frail and unable to care for itself, with mandibles too small and weak to handle anything but liquid food, sting and poison glands small, and glands that produce food for larvae and protection against bacteria are completely absent. Its exoskeleton is thin and its brain and central nerve cord are small and simplified. Behavior Tetramorium inquilinum constantly sends chemical signals that trick host ants into accepting them as full members of the colony. Being ectoparasitic, Tetramorium inquilinum spends most of its adult life clinging to the backs of its hosts, especially queens. As many as eight have been observed piggy-backing onto a single host queen, leaving her immobile. Diet Tetramorium inquilinum lives entirely on food regurgitated by its hosts, even the liquid meant for the host queen. Reproduction Nourished and nurtured well by its hosts, Tetramorium inquilinum has high fecundity. Older individuals lay an average of two eggs every minute.

Tetramorium was first described in the same publication as Monomorium. These ants are also known as pavement ants. Description Workers of most species have a ridged clypeus, an appendaged stinger, mandibles with 3 or 4 teeth, and antennae with 11 or 12 segments or with 3-segmented clubs on the tips. The genus is divided into several species groups defined by various characters. Distribution Most species are distributed throughout the Afrotropical and Oriental regions. Ten species have been recorded from Japan. The pavement ant, T. caespitum, is native to Europe and was probably introduced to North America starting in the 18th century.Jacobs, S. Pavement Ant. Penn State Extension. 2014. Biology Most known species nest in the soil, in decaying wood, or in leaf litter. Some live in trees or in termite nests.

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed August 15, 2011 tributary of the Youghiogheny River beginning in Acme, Pennsylvania and draining at its mouth in the town of Jacobs Creek into the Youghiogheny River. Jacobs Creek is the southwestern border of Westmoreland County and the northwestern border of Fayette County. The area was a major producer of rye whiskey in the decades before Prohibition. Geography Jacobs Creek, between Chaintown and its mouth, cuts a deep gorge through the Fayette Anticline, exposing many rock outcroppings and even exposures of the Freeport Coal seam. The geography of Jacobs Creek allowed early civilization in the Jacobs Creek Valley as early as 1768 when western Pennsylvania was opened to settlement by the Treaty of Fort Stanwix. According to Rambling in the Valley of Jacobs Creek (Medsger & Rowe): > Various industrial enterprises have been associated with the history of this > valley. Among the first were the manufacture of salt and iron. By the treaty > of Fort Stanwix in 1768 this region was opened for settlement and many > people from the eastern part of the state were locating in this \\"land of > promise\\". Both salt and iron were in demand, they were expensive and hard to > procure, hence men of enterprise naturally sought means to supply these > demands. George Dallas Albert in his \\"History of Westmoreland County\\", says > that, \\"Foremost of the wants of these early settlers was the want of salt.\\" > He also states that \\"in the Youghiogheny region, twenty bushels of wheat was > not thought an unfair exchange for a bushel of salt; or a cow and calf for a > similar amount.\\" Other geographic features of the valley include two waterfalls: Freeman Falls and Creek Falls.Ramblings in the Valley of Jacobs Creek History Upstream from Alliance Furnace Jacobs Creek was named for Chief Jacob, a Native American. The valley of Jacobs Creek is home to an abundance of colonial and industrial history, including the home of the Alliance Furnace, the oldest standing iron furnace west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Alliance Furnace was built before ownership of the land was obtained by William Turnbul, John Holker, and Peter Marmie on July 13, 1789. The furnace was blown in 1802. Starting in the 1790s Jacobs Creek attracted a number of Mennonite farmers. One of those Mennonites was Henry Oberholtzer (anglicized to \\"Overholt\\"). In 1800 Henry and his son Abraham cleared 150 acres near West Overton to start a farm. The farm grew rye for distilling into whiskey. The whiskey later became known as Old Overholt. Western Pennsylvania was a major producer of rye whiskey in the decades before Prohibition. Other sources of industry along the valley include salt mills, grist mills, coke ovens, strip mining, and iron ore mining.Alliance Furnace On December 19, 1907, an explosion in the Darr Coal Mine killed 239 men and boys. Recreation Recreation along Jacobs Creek includes smallmouth bass and trout fishing, seasonal whitewater kayaking, and swimming. It has been the inspiration of the guide Ramblings in the Valley of Jacobs Creek.

It is unusual in flying among the falling water and spray from waterfalls in moist tropical or subtropical forests in Costa Rica. Taxonomy Thaumatoneura inopinata is a highly distinctive species, making up a monotypic genus (Thaumatoneura) and subfamily (Thaumatoneurinae). It has been sometimes placed in the flatwing damselfly family Megapodagrionidae, but as a result of molecular phylogenetic studies by Dijkstra et al. in 2013, the genus Thaumatoneura is now considered one of two extant genera in the family Thaumatoneuridae. The species was first described in 1897 by the English entomologist Robert McLachlan, but he did not know the origin of the specimen that he had bought as part of an insect collection. It later transpired that the damselfly was from the New World when another specimen was brought back from Panama. The American entomologist Philip Powell Calvert visited Costa Rica and researched the species. The adult insects were seen in the vicinity of waterfalls, and nymphs were found on vegetated wet rocks, but it was some time before it was certain that these were of the same species. The matter was settled when one nymph was observed transforming into an adult. As the haemolymph was being pumped into the wings to expand them, the wings were at first pale green with blackish veins, and with the greenish body, the insect looked like a trembling, green leaf, exactly resembling the foliage close by. Distribution and habitat The giant waterfall damsel is found in Costa Rica and Panama. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests and rivers where it is usually found in close vicinity to waterfalls. Description Male giant waterfall damsels have two forms, one with entirely clear wings and the other with broad black bands across the wings. Females have clear wings with brown wing tips. In both sexes, the nodus (a notch in the leading edge of each wing) is closer to the base of the wings than is the case in most other damselfly species. When perched, the wings are held vertically above the abdomen, which allows water to drip off. Behaviour The giant waterfall damsel can be seen flying among the falling water and spray produced by waterfalls. The eggs are laid among the mosses and tangled roots beside the cascade which are constantly kept wet by the water. The nymphs develop among this vegetation and do not normally enter the torrent. When their development is finished and they are ready to emerge, they climb onto a rock, their skin splits and the winged adults climb out. Status The International Union for Conservation of Nature used to classify this species as \\"threatened\\" but more recently it has been found at an increasing number of locations in Costa Rica and although nowhere common, it is now assessed as being sufficiently numerous to be classified as \\"least concern\\". The chief threats it faces is deforestation, which alters stream habitats, and global warming which may cause some streams and waterfalls to dry up.

Arts County Fair was the largest student-run event in Canada; organized, produced, and promoted by the students of the Arts Undergraduate Society of the University of British Columbia. Event It combined several bands of different musical genres, one hundred and fifty volunteers, and fifteen thousand patrons to create the most widely-anticipated campus event at the University of British Columbia. The fair was not held on a specific date each year, but instead on the last day of classes at UBC. This usually put the fair during the first and sometimes second week of April each year. It has been estimated that over 160,000 people have attended the event. It usually ran from 12 noon to 8pm, and was attended by students from across British Columbia, by members of the local music and recording industries, as well as the general public. Arts County Fair was a charity event, and each year the proceeds from the concert were donated to two local or national charities. Production In preparation for the fair, the organizing committee used to commit one week to full scale preparation for the event. A group of 40-50 individuals, mostly composed of past and serving members of the Arts Undergraduate Society council, took to the field of Thunderbird Stadium. Preparations included setting up concession tents, placing plywood and covering over the entire field to prevent grass damage, and assisting with the set-up of fences. On the day of the fair, the volunteers then committed to a fifteen-hour work shift, fulfilling such essential jobs as safety patrols and drink distribution. The preparations for ACF 11 were filmed in an attempt to document the event for training purposes, but the finished video was never delivered. The partial video is available on YouTube Food and Beverage ACF was often heralded as the year's biggest beer garden, with alcoholic beverages being the staple at every fair. Because this caused issues with minors attending the event, ACF organizers tested out two options over the years. One is having the event completely closed off to minors, such as ACF 14. And the other to have a special beer garden section and a minors sections, such as at ACF 15. The latter option worked well with both groups of people being able to enjoy the concert. There used to also be a large section of concession stands that serve non-alcoholic beverages and various types of food. Bands It was the goal of the ACF organizers to represent as many genres of music at their concerts as possible. This involved frequent inclusions of rock, country and hip-hop acts in the show. Although the Fair did not exclude non-Canadian acts, ACF advertises itself as a showcase of local Canadian talent. The stage has seen many big-name bands, some before they met commercial success: The Barenaked Ladies, Crash Test Dummies, The Philosopher Kings, Matthew Good Band, Great Big Sea, Swollen Members, De La Soul, Treble Charger, K-OS, The Weakerthans, The New Pornographers, Stabilo, Sam Roberts, and Metric.

Biography Tadamasa was born in Osaka as the second son of Y≈´ki Hideyasu. His childhood name was Toramatsu (ËôéÊùæ) later become Toranosuke (Ëôé‰πãÂä©). In 1607, he was received in audience by his grandfather, Tokugawa Ieyasu and uncle Tokugawa Hidetada. Hidetada took a liking to the boy, and ordered that he be raised in the Tokugawa household by Eish≈ç-in together with Tokugawa Yorinobu. In the same year, he was assigned a fief of 10,000 koku, and became daimy≈ç of Kazusa-Anegasaki Domain. He was noted for his skill in the martial arts, and accompanied Hidetada during the Siege of Osaka, where he was frustrated that he would not be allowed to participate in the battle due to his youth. He strongly petitioned Hidetada to perform his genpuku ceremony before the start of the Osaka summer campaign, and Hidetada agreed, granting him a kanji from his name and Court rank of Senior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade and the courtesy title was Iyo-no-kami. He subsequently distinguished himself in combat with his prowess with the spear, which later became an heirloom of the Echizen-Matsudaira clan. As a reward for his actions in battle, he was transferred to Shimotsuma Domain in Hitachi Province (30,000 koku) in 1615, but the following year he replaced the disgraced Matsudaira Tadateru at Matsushiro Domain in Shinano Province (120,000 koku). In 1619 he was transferred again, this time to Takada Domain in Echigo Province (250,000 koku). In 1623, he replaced his elder brother Matsudaira Tadanao as daimy≈ç of Fukui Domain (500,000 koku) In 1626 his court rank was raised to Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade. In 1634, he accompanied Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Iemitsu to Kyoto, and Fukui Domain reached its peak kokudaka of 505,600 koku. In 1637, he was disappointed that no order came to lead his troops during the Shimabara Rebellion, so he visited the battle in a private capacity with only twelve retainers. In 1643, he ordered the rebuilding of Mikuni Harbor as the main port of Fukui Domain. He died in 1648 at the domain's residence in Edo. On his death, seven of his senior retainers also committed junshi. His grave is at the temple of Eihei-ji in Fukui. He had a magnificent upper residence (kamiyashiki) constructed outside Edo Castle.

Listed at . 170 lb., he batted left- handed and threw right-handed. He was born in Jenison, Michigan. McCoy was 22 years old when he entered the majors in September 1938 with the Detroit Tigers, appearing in seven games while hitting a .200 batting average (3-for-15). In 1939, though he played just two months for Detroit after Charlie Gehringer was injured, McCoy hit .302 with 33 runs batted in and 38 runs scored in 55 games played. At the end of the season, he was dealt by the Tigers to the Philadelphia Athletics in exchange for Wally Moses. McCoy was among 91 Detroit minor league players declared free agents by baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. The Tigers had been blocking players in their minor league system for years, players with major league skills, which was a fairly common practice in those days as there were only 16 big league clubs and precious few jobs. For a middle infielder, McCoy was a very good offensive player, but Detroit had Gehringer and he was blocked in the minors. With the deal canceled, McCoy had bids from ten major-league clubs. The Washington Senators offered him a bonus of $20,000, the New York Giants raised it to $25,000, the Brooklyn Dodgers to $35,000, and the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati Reds to $40,000. McCoy, who got $15 for his first major league season and thought his $5,000 in 1939 was big money, accepted the Philadelphia Athletics'offer: a $45,000 bonus, a two-year contract at $10,000 a year, and a regular job at second base under the tutorial guidance of manager Connie Mack. His was not only the biggest bonus in major league history, $20,000 more than the previous top, given Rick Ferrell by the St. Louis Browns in 1929, but it made McCoy the highest-paid bigleaguer of the year. His 1940 income of $55,000 will be more than the salary of Joe Di Maggio, Jimmy Foxx or Hank Greenberg. McCoy played in 1940 and 1941 with the Athletics. His most productive season came in 1941, when he hit .271 with 61 RBI and posted career-highs in games (141), hits (140), walks (95), runs (86), home runs (8), and triples (7). He spent the next four years in the US Navy during World War II. When he returned from service, his skills had eroded and he never played another game. In a four-season career, McCoy was a .269 hitter (327-for-1214) with 16 home runs and 156 RBI in 337 games, including 182 runs, 327 hits, 52 doubles, 18 triples, and eight stolen bases. A selective and patient hitter, he posted a solid .384 on-base percentage and a respectable 1.56 strikeout-to-walk ratio (190-to-122). McCoy played in the National Baseball Congress with the St Joseph's Autos team in 1946. Before his death, he was recognized as one of the oldest living major league ballplayers. McCoy died on his 96th birthday on November 9, 2011.

The bridge is listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 and is located next to Lyons Ferry Park. Original construction It was originally constructed in 1927 and known as the Vantage Ferry Bridge, where it carried the North Central Highway over the Columbia River in Vantage, replacing a four-car ferry. By 1923, the ferry was transporting 50,000 people across the river annually, and it was clear that a bridge was needed to replace it. Originally planned to be a privately constructed toll bridge, it was strongly opposed by Washington Governor Louis F. Hart because it would be a toll bridge on a taxpayer-supported highway. Not only that, but the state also stood to lose $900,000 in federal funds for the North Central Highway if a toll bridge were to be built. Instead, the state approved funding for its own bridge. However, the construction of the Wanapum Dam downriver of the bridge in the 1960s flooded the town of Vantage, and state officials decided to replace the existing two-lane bridge, which had become unsafe for high volume traffic, with a new four-lane bridge. The old bridge was dismantled and put into storage. Meanwhile, at Lyons Ferry, crossings of the Snake River were done by ferry, but the construction of the Lower Monumental Dam caused the river to slow, thus increasing crossing time. State officials then decided to reconstruct this bridge at that location.

During the colonization of America, del Canto explored the northeastern part of Mexico, and founded several cities, such as Saltillo, of which he was the first mayor (1577). He was one of the main enemies of the native Chichimeca peoples. He took numerous prisoners to work as slaves in the mines of Santa Lucia, Monterrey, and San Gregorio, Cerralvo, Nuevo Le√≥n. This resulted in his arrest in 1578 by the Inquisition for slavery. He escaped and was able to hide out, among the same Chichimecas that he was charged with enslaving, until the charges were dropped. In 1581 in Saltillo, del Canto had an affair with do√±a Juana Porcalla, wife of Diego de Montemayor (founder of Monterrey). Upon learning of the affair, de Montemayor killed his wife and vowed to kill del Canto as well.

In the isopod's natural habitat the thermal waters ranged in temperature from . In 1947, when the spring was diverted to supply the city of Socorro with drinking water, the isopods ended up living in an old water supply pipe that led to a horse trough and two small, old, concrete bathing pools. In 1988, the wild population became extinct when a tree root burst the pipe and cut off water flow to the concrete pools. Existing captive populations were bred to restore the isopod community near the spring and they were reintroduced into eight new concrete pools (tanks). As of 2006, captive populations are kept at the Albuquerque Biological Park, the Minnesota Zoo, the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish Laboratory in Santa Fe, and by the Department of Biology at New Mexico Tech. Thermosphaeroma thermophilum engage in cannibalistic interactions, meaning these species feed on other individuals which belong to the same species as a source of food.
