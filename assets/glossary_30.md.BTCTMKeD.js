To create a true in vitro protein evolution technology his laboratory developed ribosome display of whole proteins. In his research group Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) were created as a robust alternative scaffold for binding proteins (antibody mimetics). DARPins are derived from naturally occurring ankyrin proteins, a protein class that mediates high-affinity protein-protein interactions in nature. DARPins (Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins), one of the most common binding proteins in nature and responsible for diverse functions, such as cell signaling and receptor binding. To obtain highly stable G protein-coupled receptors that can be used for structural studies and in drug screening, his research group developed new directed evolution technologies. Honors and awards He won a Young Investigator's Award of the German Chemical Industry Trust (Fonds der chemischen Industrie). In 2000, he received the Karl-Heinz- Beckurts Award (Munich, Germany).

Lead guitarist Saul Adamczewski was previously the frontman of indie pop band the Metros, which also featured Fat White Family's bass player, Joe Pancucci. They released their debut album, Champagne Holocaust, in 2013, on UK label Trashmouth Records. It was released in 2014 in the U.S. on Fat Possum Records. The band released Fat Whites/Taman Shud, a split EP with Taman Shud, on 11 December 2013 on Trashmouth. On 10 March 2014, Fat White Family issued their first single, \\"Touch the Leather\\", on Hate Hate Hate Records. In early 2014, the band launched a PledgeMusic campaign to fund their show at the South by Southwest festival, with a subsequent US tour. Pledgers were given the self-released EP Crippled B-Sides and Inconsequential Rarities. Next was the single \\"I Am Mark E Smith\\" (referencing singer Mark E. Smith of the Fall), released 15 December 2014. Their second album, Songs for Our Mothers, was released in 2016 by the Without Consent label. Lias Saoudi described the album as an attempt to ‚Äúreally to get at the shittiness lurking in the core of my own soul, and in everybody else's.‚Äù It was promoted with a single for \\"Whitest Boy on the Beach\\", which was later chosen for the closing credits of the 2017 film T2 Trainspotting. Fat White Family's next single, \\"Breaking Into Aldi\\", was released on 16 August 2016. On 9 January 2019, Fat White Family announced that their third album, Serfs Up, would be released on 19 April 2019 on Domino Records. This was followed by the singles \\"Feet\\" and \\"Tastes Good With The Money\\", the latter featuring spoken lyrics by Baxter Dury, and a video directed by R√≥is√≠n Murphy.

The grand house was built in a Palladian- influenced design in approximately 1740.The History of Cornwall, Civil, Military, Religious By Richard Polwhele It was reputed to be the most expensive houses built in Cornwall, at that time. According to Davies Gilbert the historian: \\"The basement story was built of granite, the upper part with a light coloured slate, or killas, and the whole lined with brick; the door cases, windows, pediment and balustrades were of the Ionic order. The chimney pieces, which were finished in Italy, were remarkably elegant, in respect of the richness of the marble, the delicacy of the design, and the excellence of the sculpture. The library occupied two rooms, the longest of which was 36ft in length, 24ft broad and 16ft high; and all the other apartments were equal in design, and finished throughout in a style in which elegance and comfort were alike combined.\\" Hoblyn Family The last person of the direct line of Hoblyns to live at the property was a Robert Hoblyn. Following his death, the property passed to a relative, known as the Rev Robert Hoblyn of Bath. He had nine children. The Fire, November 1803 In 1803 during the tenure of Rev Hoblyn the main house was destroyed by fire. It is reputed that the fire was caused by an oil lamp knocked over by a servant boy. No lives were lost in the fire, that burned for three days.

The party was historically part of the pro-Carlos Hugo wing of the Carlist movement. The party was not legalized until late 1977.  Organization and ideology  The EKA defines itself as a federation of the Carlist parties of each of the four Basque provinces (Navarre, √Ålava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay), each of them fully autonomous in their respective territories. At the state level, the EKA is confederated with the Carlist Party of Spain (or the Spains according to the traditional terminology of the movement), one of the parties that claims to be the direct heir of the historic Carlist movement. The party has an official magazine, Montejurra, which it is also the name of the mountain where they celebrate their annual feast. After the general assembly of October 2008, the party appointed Jos√© Maria Porro Sa√≠nz (exmilitant of the Grupos de Acci√≥n Carlista and one of the leaders of Uni√≥n Sindical Obrera in Navarre) as its secretary general and Feliciano V√©lez (who after the municipal elections of 2007, was elected mayor of the Navarrese town of Puente la Reina in the lists of the Agrupaci√≥n Electoral Puentesina) as organization secretary. Ideologically, the party defends a model of socialism based in workers' self-management inspired by Yugoslav socialism and a federal Euskal Herria in a confederal Spain.Izu Belloso, Miguel Jos√© (2001). Navarra como problema. Naci√≥n y nacionalismo en Navarra. Madrid: Biblioteca Nueva. p. 342.  History  The EKA was one of the organizers of the 1976 Aberri Eguna in collaboration with the various parties of the Basque independentist left (including ETA(m), ETA(pm), EHAS and LAIA) and the Spanish revolutionary left (MC, LCR and ORT). In February 1977, the party participated in the creation of the Euskal Erakunde Herritarra. Initially, the Frente Obrero was linked to the Workers' Commissions, but due to the influence of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) in them the EKA eventually opted for the Uni√≥n Sindical Obrera, with which it shared common aspirations regarding self-management socialism as its social project. In April 1977, 150 EKA members occupied the Diputaci√≥n of Navarre in protest against the violation of human rights by the Spanish state.¬´Por la presencia de Su√°rez en la ONU. Los carlistas toman la Diputaci√≥n navarra¬ª. Diario 16. 28 April 1977. The same year, the government denied the legalization of the party that presented a list to the elections called Agrupaci√≥n Montejurra. The position of the party in the constitutional referendum of 1978 generated an intense and complicated internal debate. Finally, the party asked for an affirmative vote, but they lost a relevant number of members due to this decision.¬´Partido Carlista de Euzkadi: \\"Todo lo que no sea el s√≠ es irresponsable\\"¬ª.

In 1996, the party published a pacifist manifest calling for both the end of ETA and repression. In 1998, it signed the Pact of Estella.  Institutional presence  Until 1987, the EKA had about ten councilors in the town councils of several medium-sized urban areas like Tolosa (Gipuzkoa) or Sang√ºesa (Navarre).Elecciones Municipales en Euskadi y Navarra 1979-2015 In smaller rural towns, the party always supported or created diverse local platforms, like Agrupaci√≥n Electoral Puentesina in Puente la Reina (Navarre). In the local elections of 2003, the following Navarrese carlists were elected as councilors: Gerardo Montoya (Noain), Feliciano V√©lez and Aurelio Laita (Puente La Reina ‚Äì Gares), J. Joaqu√≠n Urra (Artajona - Artaxoa), Federico Salcedo (Andosilla), Cruz Barandalla and Roberto Beruete (Zirauki) and Carlos Garc√≠a (Tabar). The only institutional representation the party ever got other than local representatives was a Navarrese member of parliament (Mariano Zuf√≠a Urrizalqui) in 1979‚Äì1983.

Since such a board can be constructed by pushing together four standard 8√ó8 boards, Betza also gave this variant the alternative names of four-board chess or chess on four boards. Game description Chess on a really big board was created as an outgrowth of Betza's ideas on three-dimensional chess, after he noted that an 8√ó8√ó8 board for 3D chess would have 512 spaces, more than any large version of chess that had previously been invented; he then considered two-dimensional very large (or, in his word, \\"huge\\") chess games, mainly on the 16√ó16 board because such a board requires no non-standard equipment to construct, and while much larger than the 8√ó8 board, it was not so big as to make an unplayable game. This idea eventually came full circle in the development of the 16√ó16√ó16 three- dimensional version of chess on a really big board, which he called \\"impossibly large\\".3D Chess on a Really Big Board at The Chess Variant Pages The standard rules of chess apply, except for the following cases: * An unmoved pawn can move one step, up to the middle of the board (in the case of the 16√ó16 board, the eighth rank), or anything in between. Thus, 1.i8 is a legal opening move, and so are 1.i3, 1.i4, 1.i5, 1.i6, and 1.i7. Once it has moved for the first time, it can only make one step at a time. (In the case of an 8√ó8 board, this is exactly the same as in standard chess). Such a long initial pawn move allows the moving pawn to be captured en passant by an enemy pawn as if it had stopped on any one of the squares it had passed through. * In castling, the rook moves the same distance as it does in chess. Thus, the king moves further; if it castles kingside, it ends on the second-rightmost file, and if it castles queenside, it ends on the third-leftmost file. On the 16√ó16 board, 0-0 leaves the rook on the n-file and the king on the o-file, and 0-0-0 leaves the rook on the d-file and the king on the c-file. * The 50-move rule becomes at least a 100-move rule. Generally, if each of the board's dimensions is multiplied by n, the number of non-capturing or non-pawn moves allowable before draw claims become possible must also be multiplied by at least n. * There are extra fairy chess pieces that move differently, although the orthodox pieces are retained. Their movements are given below using Ralph Betza's \\"funny notation\\". In physical play, these six types of fairy pieces may be represented by pieces from mismatched chess sets. Note that Betza did not specify icons or designs for the fairy pieces for diagrams, instead using letters to represent them: the diagrams here use common renderings for the archbishop and chancellor, an inverted knight for the rose, and Omega Chess pieces for the remaining three fairy piece types.Golden Age Chess on a Really Big Board at The Chess Variant Pages The reason for Betza's inclusion of the rose in his initial setup was that it was a piece especially suited for a large board: it cannot display its full power on boards smaller than 13√ó13. Furthermore, its already large move still cannot reach all the way across the board, contributing to the large feeling of the game along with the ability of the riders to attack from a large distance away. Gameplay Betza described his choice of pieces as \\"a very basic and logical selection of the fundamental geometrical moves, except for my idiosyncratic insistence on including the Rose in the lineup of pieces. These are largely the basic units of chess, and anybody who designs a [16√ó16] game with 32 pieces is bound to come up with something reasonably similar, at least if they want it to be like chess but a bit less tactical.\\" In fact, his original plan was to include FD along with the complementary WA (the phoenix from chu shogi), but this leaves the c- and n-pawns undefended in the initial position. His final assessment was that the game was \\"rather chesslike\\". Betza divided the pieces into three classes: seven long-range pieces (the rooks, bishops, queen, archbishop, and chancellor), two mid-range pieces (the rose and superknight), and six short- range pieces (the knights, FD's, and WFA's). He opined that the short-range pieces, though the weakest, were crucial as they take time to get into the action, but are very important for opening up specific lines for attacks. =Sample opening phase of a game= The following sample game fragment was constructed by Betza. :1.i8 i9 :2.Qp9 The 16√ó16 analogue to the Wayward Queen Attack (in orthodox chess, 1.e4 e5 2.Qh5). On such a large board, this opening move becomes much sounder, as it is more difficult to attack the queen, and from this position it bears down onto the centre from a long distance. :2...h10 :3.j8 Oh11 Black defends his i-pawn; White attacks it again (her j-pawn being defended by the chancellor on j1); Black defends it again, moving his rose from f16 via e14 and f12 to h11, where it defends the pawn on i9. Trading pawns would be disadvantageous and lead to the loss of a tempo by the initiator, but at some point White's chancellor must be developed. Currently, White has no immediate threats. Attacks on Black's h-pawn with Bb4 (moving the d-pawn away first), or his rose with Bo4 (moving the m-pawn away first) are easy to counter. Hence she decides to bring a short-range piece to attack, though this will take several turns. :4.Ji4 Ai15 :5.Jh6 Ak14 Attacking White's queen. :6.Qp10 Ji13 :7.p8!? Threatening to lift the king's rook to the h-file to contest the centre. :7...An11!? Continuing to attack White's queen. This region could also be used as an advanced base: the n11 square can easily be defended by the rose or the m-pawn, and a natural follow-up would be 8...Qn10. :8.Ql6 Ak8 The White queen retreats and attacks the Black i-pawn again, but Black defends the pawn with the archbishop while attacking the queen again. The archbishop itself, though attacked by White's superknight, is protected by Black's rose. :9.Qo3 If 9.Qk7, then 9...Al9 may win a pawn. :9...Ql12 Threatening 10...Al6. =Sample games= The following are some of the only complete games of chess on a really big board played on The Chess Variant Pages, and are not intended as representative examples of good play.

Two FDs on different colours can force checkmate without their king's help.The FD by Ralph Betza, The Chess Variant Pages The endgame of queen versus rook is drawn on the 16√ó16 board. (In fact, it is generally won only on 5√ó5 through 15√ó15 square boards.)The contributions of Marc Bourzutschky to chess endgame knowledge, John Beasley (January 2015) Sub- variants=Golden age chess on a really big board= Betza also created a second 16√ó16 variant, which he termed golden age chess on a really big board. He wrote: \\"This game is designed to create an open position in which development, initiative, and attack are all-important, the positions are too complex to calculate so you must play by intuition, and you never count Pawns -- in other words, a return to the Golden Age!\\" The inverted knight in the diagram is the rose from chess on a really big board, and the superknight and archbishop remain the same. The other pieces are as follows: The shortest possible checkmate is: :1.Wa13 i9 2.Wi13 Ai15 3.Wi12# The shortest game ending in quadruple check and mate is: :1.Wa3 Np8 2.Wi3 Nxm2 3.Al3 Nk1 4.Bn5 Nxi2 5.Rxi2 i9 6.Rh3 i8 7.Bh5 i7 8.Wi2+ i6 9.Axi6 h14 10.Ad11# =Nine-board chess= Betza also proposed a 24√ó24 version of chess on a really big board, although he did not fully design it. His description of the game was \\"Push 9 boards together in a [3√ó3] square, symmetrically replicate all the unique pieces from the four-board chess lineup, add a W beside the K, two Fs flanking the K [and] W, and you have a game.\\" The W and F are here the wazir and ferz. This description is however not unique: the positions of the roses, superknights, archbishops, chancellors, and queens are not determined, as some of them are equidistant to the king in the four-board chess initial position, and it is not clear if the king should be on the l-file or the m-file.) The addition of such weak pieces was intended to balance the duplication of the more powerful pieces. =Four-board Shatranj= Betza also suggested a version with even fewer tactics that would eliminate many of the riders, replacing bishops with alfils and queens with , turning archbishops into knight-alfil compounds, and turning chancellors into either rook-alfil or rook-ferz compounds. =Rule changes= Betza remarked that the rules of most chess variants, such as cylindrical chess or avalanche chess, could be applied to chess on a really big board; nonetheless, he considered applying the rules of cylindrical chess to the 16√ó16 board \\"silly\\" because it made distances feel even larger, recommending Avalanche chess instead as it shortens the game. Betza also thought favourably of applying the rules of momentum chess to the 16√ó16 board. Another possibility Betza mentioned is the rules of Viennese Kriegspiel, where the middle of the board (the line between the 8th and 9th ranks) is blocked by a screen and players can move their pieces freely up to their first six ranks. Once both players are satisfied with their arrangement (this can be enforced with a timer), the screen is removed and normal play resumes. It would also be possible to play without the screen, which Betza called \\"Sighted Viennese Kriegspiel\\". A further possibility Betza entertained was a 3D version of chess on a really big board on a 16√ó16√ó16 board, which brought its inspiration full circle. On each level, the 2D setup would be repeated, and the pieces' moves would be translated into three dimensions just as in his idea of 8√ó8√ó8 3D chess. Nevertheless, he commented on it: \\"What an awful idea. Each player has 256 Pawns and 256 pieces. The average length of a game is likely to be more [than] 2000 moves.\\" =Different starting positions= Betza also considered starting positions with 16 (one chess set) or 64 (four sets) pieces instead of 32 (two sets), but eventually rejected them. They are as follows: =Three dimensions= Betza suggested a 16√ó16√ó16 three-dimensional adaptation of the rules of chess on a really big board, which would be formed by pushing eight 8√ó8√ó8 boards into a cube and then translating the moves into 3D following how he did so for his version of 8√ó8√ó8 3D chess, although he expressed reservations about the likely game length. =Unrealised suggestions= Betza also suggested \\"Four Board Great Chess\\", which would have more pieces than the rose that could not make their full moves on smaller boards, and having pawns on the third rank and about 24 pieces in the two rows behind them; and similarly, \\"Four Board Great Shatranj\\", where the pieces would be weakened further. Another suggestion of his was four-board chess with different armies, suggesting that one player could use knights and the other could use fibnifs (fbNF; moves forward or backward as knight, or as ferz in all directions), though noting that creating completely new armies was not possible in 1996 as the values of long-range pieces on 16√ó16 boards were not yet known to much precision. However, none were developed beyond ideas. A further variant Betza considered is \\"Sixty-Four Board Chess\\", which would be played on a 64√ó64 board with 4096 squares (the same as 16√ó16√ó16 chess). Betza's comment was: Similarly, he considered a 64√ó64√ó64 3D variant, which he put forward as a possible world record for the largest chess variant (having 262144 cubes), although he did not completely specify the rules, beyond stating that the standard opening setup for orthodox chess would simply be repeated to fill the 64√ó64 boards.

Early life and education Von Behrens was born on May 14, 1977, in Mattoon, Illinois, to Tina (Zike) Von Behrens. He grew up in the small town of Stewardson, Illinois. He graduated from Stewardson-Strasburg High School in the class of 1995 and later attended Lake Land College in Mattoon. In his youth, Von Behrens played baseball and wanted to eventually play at the college level. As a teenager, Von Behrens hit .400 for the Stewardson-Strasburg High School Comets and wanted to play for the Chicago Cubs. Ryne Sandberg was his hero. By age 17, he was diagnosed with oral cancer. His battle with cancer forced him to give up his dream of becoming a major league baseball player.  Personal life  Von Behrens‚Äô cancer went into remission when he was 23. He then married Sara M.

He traveled across the United States working as a national spokesman for Oral Health America's National Spit Tobacco Education Program. As part of his efforts, he spoke to high school and junior high school children in all 50 states and 10 Canadian provinces. In 2010, he testified before a U.S. Senate hearing about the dangers of tobacco in professional sports. In 2012, Von Behrens testified at a Maryland legislative hearing, urging lawmakers to increase the tobacco tax on cigars and smokeless tobacco to 70%, the same level as the tax rate on cigarettes. He also participated in tobacco awareness campaigns, such as the Campaign for Tobacco-free Kids and The Truth Campaign.  Health and death  Before and after photo of Gruen Von Behrens Von Behrens started dipping at age 13 and was diagnosed with mouth cancer by age 17. Von Behrens said the cancer began as a white spot, the size of a pinpoint, on the side of his tongue. He said he didn't give it a second thought because white spots are not uncommon among chewing tobacco users. But it didn't go away. In one of his interviews, he was quoted saying that one day, his tongue actually split in half because the cancer was inside the tongue and then split it. He subsequently endured more than 40 operations on his face, neck, and mouth, radiation treatments and chemotherapy. Doctors removed half of his tongue muscles and his jaw. They also took out half of his neck muscles. Doctors took sections of healthy skin from his legs and grafted them to his face and neck. Because of radiation treatments, all of his teeth were removed, and at age 19, he had to start using dentures. His lower jaw was replaced with fibula bone from his lower leg. He was left severely disfigured by the surgeries. After a long battle with mouth cancer, Von Behrens died in his home in Stewardson, Illinois, on September 8, 2015, at age 38.

The building is situated on Paradisgade in the central Indre by neighbourhood.  History  The Aarhus Craftsmen's Association was established in 1848 and it still exists today. The purpose of the association was originally to generally safeguard the interests of the craftsmen in the city and license and test new craftsmen. On 2 December 1848 an asylum foundation was established on the association's general meeting. The foundation was tasked with collecting funds for old and weak craftsmen or their widows. In 1867 enough funds had been collected and construction for a new asylum building began. The asylum was placed in Paradisgade next to the association building and was finished in 1868. In 1980 the building was listed.  Architecture  The buildings was designed by Vilhelm Theodor Walther and is reminiscent of some of his other works such as Holme Church and the adjacent Caftsmen Association building. It's a 3 story building constructed of red brick topped with a hip roof of winged brick. Cornices of masonry rings the top of the building.

A peace conference called the Inter-Congolese Dialogue was held Pretoria, South Africa on December the 16, 2002, with hundreds of members from Congolese civil society participating in the dialogue. The peace conference brought together the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the political opposition, the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD); the Mai-Mai militia; the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC); members of civil society; the Congolese Rally for Democracy/Liberation Movement (RDC/ML); and the Congolese Rally for Democracy/National (RCD/N) to find a solution which would promote national unity after the wars and conflicts in the country. The result of the Inter- Congolese dialogue was the Sun City accord which was an agreement that the transitional government would establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission as part of its mandate to promote national healing and unity. Conflicts The First Congo War referred to by some as the Great Wars of Africa or the African World Wars, began in 1996 with an invasion of the Congo-Zaire by its bordering states and Congolese rebel groups. The eastern part of Congo suffered destabilization as a result of the Rwandan genocide, as many rebels, refugees and war criminals fled across the border from Rwanda in order to escape consequences of the conflicts during the genocide. As Mobutu Sese Seko's regime lost control of the eastern part of the country, a Congolese leader named Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila sought help from neighboring states in order to overthrow Mobutu's dictatorship. After successfully removing Mobutu from power with the help of Hutu and Tutsi forces in 1997, Kabila proclaimed himself president and renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Disagreements between Kabila and his former allies Rwanda and Uganda over compensation and the future relationships of the neighboring states led to a growing sense of vulnerability as the Rwandan and Ugandan armies used to defeat Mobutu's army now stood uncontested in the capital Kinshasa. The Second Congo War began in 1998 as alliances shifted. Kabila and his former allies grew apart due to Rwanda and Uganda shifting their support to a new rebellion under the banner of the Rally for Congolese Democracy. Kabila forged new alliances with Angola, Zimbabwe, and Namibia and in 1999 negotiations resulted in most countries involved withdrawing their forces from the state. Foreign interest in the resource rich nation had always been at the source of the conflicts, going back to the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, Laurent Kabila's assassination was supported by foreign powers and orchestrated by Lebanese nationals. While the assassination succeeded, the coup d'√©tat ultimately failed, as DRC's regime managed to maintain control over the state and promptly put Kabila's son Joseph in power. Joseph Kabila serves as the president in the transitional government, but the Great African Wars have grown very complex, and the east remains destabilized with conflicts flaring up periodically. Various parties, armies, rebel groups, and international actors remain involved and invested in the Congo today. Mandate and composition The Comprehensive Peace Agreement created institutions to help the country transition to peace including the Truth and Reconciliation commission, aimed to help those affected by the conflicts in the eastern provinces. The mandate of the commission was to promote national unity by examining the socio-economic and political conflicts since independence in the 1960s. Using Articles 154 ‚Äì 160 of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the truth commission was tasked with the re-establishment of peace in the state by establishing a narrative of truth from the conflicting accounts of history. The commission was led by Bishop Jean-Luc Kuye Ndondo wa Mulemera and had a total of 21 members. The 21 members represented on the panel came from the various groups involved in the conflict. The commission was made up of Congolese civil society such as social scientists, religious leaders, non- governmental organizations, victims, and perpetrators. Of the 21 members, 8 officers and 13 provincial representatives were selected. Results Multiple issues caused the commission to suffered a slow start and as a result much of the goals were not met during the 4 year mandate. Issues including the selection process and criteria for membership of commissioners, and the training process for the positions made it difficult for the commission to start any work mandated by the accords. Issues with the selection process further complicated things because commissioners were selected almost a year before the commissions terms of reference had been set. This was controversial due to the lack of confidence the selected commissioners inspired. Many believed that the many candidates lacked the credibility needed to effectively run a truth commission. Efforts began to begin the various training sessions around the country for the various people who would be part of the commission, but the truth commission barely made it past this stage and thus the truth commission accomplished very little work. Another obstacle for the truth commission was that its mandate to tackle issues which began from the colonial period to today, was perhaps too large of a task for one commission to attempt to resolve. Ongoing disputes between various sections of Congolese society, including political and ethno-cultural disputes, and the pending elections would ultimately prove to be too grand an endeavor. The commission fell victim to a degree of politicization due to the ongoing political climate, tense political rivalry from both internal and international actors made the truth commission less of a priority compared to the battle over who would win the elections and dictate which direction the country would go into. The political climate dictated the direction in which the commission went, this is in part due to issues with the power-sharing climate in which the commission was operating under. Many people who were directly involved in the conflict were selected to be commissioners in order to represent their respective side of the conflicts. The commission ended and assessed their work in 2006 and unanimously agreed that a second truth commission was needed after the elections of 2006 in hopes that with a more settled political climate, the new commission would be better positioned to more effectively tackle the issues. While the commission operated for 4 years, the final report was only 84 pages long. No concrete or substantive findings were reported and only general recommendations were proposed instead. Ongoing conflicts limited the ability to do any investigations, and thus no victims, perpetrators, or witnesses were included in the reports. Limited information about procedures, tasks, targets, methodology or impact where detailed. The commission's work was relatively restricted to mediating the political struggle between the various factions involved in the conflict. In 2007 the former chair drafted a proposal for a second commission, but enthusiasm died down as the political climate stabilized in the country. Donors and policy makers also lost confidence in the commissions ability to effectively tackle these issues because of how politicized the first one became. Other more important issues such as the ongoing conflict in the east of Congo, economic developments, and new economic and social initiatives from the newly elected government took precedence over the truth commission and as a result attempts to start a new truth commission continue to this day. Assessment The truth commission's success depended on a number of factors which were not in the favor of reconciliation, in the analysis of Priscilla Hayner and Elena Naughton. The Congo's wars and ongoing conflicts involve a complex array of parties with different stakes and goals in the region. The eastern part of Congo is a proxy battle field in which both regional and international actors are fighting for control of the resources rich nation. Due to this investment, international support for a resolution of the conflict has not been very strong, as world powers support and fund various regional actors involved in the conflict. Further, the commission's link to the transitional government, and the political climate which attempted to apply a democratic power sharing structure, prevented any real progress due to the power struggles between the various parties trying to steer the destiny of the country. As many people involved in the conflict were part of the commission, it made little effort to investigate, condemn, or punish perpetrators of war crimes, which resulted in a sort of impunity for those responsible for the atrocities. The ongoing conflicts also made it impossible to do any effective work despite the government's efforts to try to establish a degree of stability and peace. The broad mandate which is clearly the cause of the conflicts, made it difficult to effectively tackle the issues which the commission was tasked to resolve. Because of the transitory government, eventual elections and ongoing conflicts, the truth commission was involuntarily reoriented towards conflict prevention and mediation instead of its mandated truth seeking work.

Andre did try to write a guest verse, but he failed to do so. The track was released as a promotional single from the album as part of West's GOOD Fridays program. Composition and lyrics \\"30 Hours\\" heavily samples the 1986 track \\"Answers Me\\" by Arthur Russell. The song also includes a sample of drums from the 1973 single \\"Joy\\" by Isaac Hayes. The album version has an outro similar to that of \\"Last Call\\" from West's debut studio album The College Dropout (2004). By the time that all the changes had been made to The Life of Pablo in June 2016, the track had been crafted by West to sound like the original version. The song interpolates Nelly singles \\"E.I.\\" and \\"Hot in Herre\\". Release Prior to the release of the song, \\"Real Friends\\" and \\"No More Parties in LA\\" had already been released for streaming as part of the GOOD Fridays program. The track was released as a promotional single just like they were, so West made it solely available for free streaming on SoundCloud instead of sites like iTunes or Amazon Music where it had to be paid for. \\"30 Hours\\" went on to be removed from SoundCloud, despite the two promotional singles \\"Facts\\" and \\"No More Parties in LA\\" still being available on the site. The Life of Pablo was scheduled to be titled \\"Waves\\" at one point and the track was set to be a part of Act 2 on one of the track lists for the album. On the day that the song was released, West announced via Twitter that the featuring album was being mastered and set for release later on in the day, alongside promotion of the single ‚Äì however, the release was delayed by two days due to Chance the Rapper fighting to keep the track \\"Waves\\" as part of it. Two days after The Life of Pablo's release, West tweeted out thanks to Drake for helping him write \\"30 Hours\\" along with \\"Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1\\" and also promised more music with both Drake and Future. Recording Photography of background vocalist Andre 3000 in the studio alongside other rappers with West working on the album was posted on 2 Chainz's Instagram in January 2016. When Andre was on his way to the studio in Los Angeles, he decided to bring a random Uber passenger with him. Andre revealed that he was expecting to drop a guest verse on \\"30 Hours\\" and that others expected one from him, though the collaboration fell through. Critical reception When reviewing The Life of Pablo for Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield viewed \\"30 Hours\\" as \\"the most stunning track here\\". Gavin Haynes of NME described West's sampling of \\"Answers Me\\" in the track as where \\"he pulls off the most masterful of these high-low art juxtapositions\\".

The film stars DuVall, Melanie Lynskey, Natasha Lyonne, Vincent Piazza, Jason Ritter, Ben Schwartz, Alia Shawkat and Cobie Smulders. The Intervention had its world premiere at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2016. It was released in a limited release and through video on demand on August 26, 2016, by Samuel Goldwyn Films and Paramount Pictures. Premise A weekend getaway for four couples takes a sharp turn when one of the couples discovers the entire trip was orchestrated to host an \\"intervention\\" on their marriage. Cast * Clea DuVall as Jessie; an independent-minded career woman and the girlfriend of Sarah. DuVall wrote the character of Jessie with the intention of playing the role herself, although she said after the film's release that she would not cast herself again in a film she was directing due to the stress of directing and acting at the same time. Being an open lesbian herself, Duvall wrote Jessie as gay because she wanted to normalize gay relationships and feature \\"a gay couple in a movie where it's not about them being gay\\". * Melanie Lynskey as Annie; a neurotic, insecure and alcoholic woman who is the mastermind of the \\"marriage intervention\\" and Matt's fianc√©e. DuVall wrote The Intervention for Lynskey, who is a close friend of hers. She wrote the role of Annie with Lynskey in mind, and Lynskey read DuVall's drafts of the screenplay as she wrote it. Lynskey had three therapy sessions before the film went into production to prepare herself for working with her friend and communicating with each other professionally as actor and director. She said afterwards, \\"I didn't want anything to happen to our friendship and a big challenge was being able to stick up for myself and my perspective in regard to the script and this character.\\" * Alia Shawkat as Lola; a free-spirited hippy-type woman and girlfriend of Jack. Shawkat was also a longtime friend of DuVall's. She was the second actor to be cast, after Lynskey. * Cobie Smulders as Ruby; the long-suffering wife of the career-minded Peter. Smulders broke her leg shortly before filming was scheduled to begin. Instead of replacing her or choosing camera angles that would hide her injury, DuVall chose to include it in the story. Smulders felt that it \\"added more vulnerability\\" to her character and DuVall later described it as \\"one of [her] favorite things about the movie\\". * Natasha Lyonne as Sarah; Jessie's girlfriend. Lyonne, DuVall and Lynskey had been close friends since appearing together in the 1999 comedy But I'm a Cheerleader. DuVall felt that their history of playing lovers in But I'm a Cheerleader, as well as their real-life friendship, \\"really lent itself to be able to play girlfriends in a way that felt authentic\\". * Jason Ritter as Matt; Annie's fianc√©e. Ritter is Lynskey's real-life partner. DuVall cast him as Matt because she had difficulty writing the part and trusted that he could \\"make it feel like a complete character\\". * Ben Schwartz as Jack; a free- spirited hippy type and Lola's latest boyfriend. * Vincent Piazza as Peter; a workaholic businessman and Ruby's husband. DuVall described Piazza as \\"one of the sweetest guys I've ever met in my entire life\\" and said that because of his nature, \\"there were times [during filming] he would be too nice, and I would have to convince him to be an asshole.\\" Production DuVall started writing The Intervention in 2012. The idea for a story based around a marital intervention came partly from DuVall's own life; she said that she was too judgmental of her friends' lives and reluctant to face her own problems. She did not initially intend to direct the script she had written for The Intervention, but changed her mind while trying to find another director. The film was produced by Sam Slater and Paul Bernon of Burn Later Productions, along with Sev Ohanian. Bernon and Slater became involved after asking DuVall's agency if they had any film projects in need of financing, and Ohanian was brought to the project by Mel Eslyn, who served as an executive producer. DuVall said that the process of finding investors was fast and relatively easy, which she attributed to the film's very low budget. The film's financing was secured six months after DuVall had finished writing the script, and filming began three months later. Four members of the main cast (Lynskey, Lyonne, Ritter and Shawkat) were friends of DuVall's, while the other three (Smulders, Piazza and Schwartz) were cast through \\"a connection to someone else in the cast\\". The film was shot in Savannah, Georgia, over the course of 18 days in the summer of 2015. It was filmed in particularly hot weather, which caused the cinematographer, Polly Morgan, to develop heat stroke. The house where the majority of filming took place repeatedly lost power, leaving the cast and crew without air conditioning and running water on set. DuVall later said that the heat and the problems it caused \\"probably helped add tension to the scenes\\". Each scene was shot with two cameras simultaneously, with one focused on the speaking character and the other focused on those who were not speaking. The filmmakers chose not to have playback monitors on set in order to save time and money; DuVall said that this made it difficult to act and direct at the same time since she was unable to watch scenes that required her to be in front of the camera. The film was scored by Sara Quin of Tegan and Sara, making her debut as a film composer. DuVall had collaborated with Tegan and Sara several times before as a director of their music videos. She wanted Quin to create a \\"non-traditional\\" film score, saying, \\"A big reason why I wanted to work with Sara on the score is because she hasn't done it before. I wanted something that didn't sound like the scores I am used to hearing.\\" Tegan and Sara also wrote and performed a song for the film, titled \\"Fade Out\\". When DuVall approached her about The Intervention, Sara Quin had already written a rough version of the song; she rewrote some of the lyrics to fit with the film. DuVall chose to only feature songs with female vocalists on the film's soundtrack. Release The Intervention had its world premiere at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2016, where Lynskey received a Special Jury Award for Individual Performance. Two days after the premiere, it was announced that Paramount Pictures had acquired worldwide distribution rights for around $2.5 million. The film screened at the Seattle International Film Festival on May 28, 2016, and served as the opening night film for Outfest on July 7, 2016. It was released in a limited release in theaters and on video on demand through iTunes on August 26, 2016. Its theatrical run lasted for a single week; it grossed $32,919 from 17 theaters. Reception The Intervention received mostly positive reviews from critics. It currently holds an 78% \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 51 reviews, with an average rating of 6.41/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"The Interventions familiar plot is enlivened by complex character dynamics and a likable cast.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 57 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Dennis Harvey of Variety gave the film a positive review, writing, \\"Clea DuVall's debut as writer- director breaks no new ground in themes or execution, but is pleasingly accomplished on all levels.\\" IndieWire's Kate Erbland gave the film a B+ rating, describing it as \\"a sharp-tongued and smart observational comedy\\" and praising DuVall's \\"crisp and smart\\" direction. Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times found the film \\"unfussy, dryly amusing and sincere\\", and praised the performances of Lynskey and Smulders. Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times called the film \\"confident and accomplished\\" and compared it favorably to The Big Chill. In a review for Entertainment Weekly, Kevin P. Sullivan gave the film a B rating, writing, \\"The script wobbles between heavy-handed and touching, but the result is a pleasantly nostalgic throwback that's saved from its copy-cat tendencies by charismatic actors.\\" On the other hand, The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy found the film \\"bland and without consequence\\" and opined that DuVall ought to have brought on a co-writer to \\"create more distinctive characters and dialogue\\". Nigel M. Smith of The Guardian gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, criticizing DuVall's \\"misjudgment of tone\\" in writing it as a comedy rather than fully exploring the \\"messed up\\" characters. Writing for Slant Magazine, Diego Semerene called the film's premise unoriginal and formulaic, ultimately describing it as \\"intolerable\\".

It is in the community of Eglwyswrw and the parish of Nevern, and is on the B4329 road between Crosswell and Tafarn y Bwlch. Afon Brynberian flows through the village under an ancient bridge and joins the River Nevern to the north. History In medieval times Brynberian was in the ancient cantref of Cemais, under Norman control from about 1100 until 1326. The hundred of Cemais was created in 1536. Freeholders of Cemais held pasture rights on the Preseli Mountains from the 13th century. Brynberian was one of the last places to be enclosed and probably began to be settled around the time of the establishment of the Independent Chapel in 1690. The bridge is mentioned by George Owen of Henllys as existing c.1600. During the 19th century there was a woollen factory and mill and most of the present buildings in the village are 19th century. An 1888 map shows a number of buildings. The mill is a Grade II- listed building, as is one of its outbuildings. The village is in the south of the parish of Nevern. It previously had a shop, Post Office and school, but these are now closed. The school, Llwynihirion, became Brynberian Community Centre. Chapel Chapel burial ground Brynberian Independent Chapel is a Grade II listed building and may have been built, as others were, to serve the settlement which was some distance from the parish church. The chapel was founded in 1690, one of the earliest in the locality, and the movement spread from Brynberian to other local settlements. It was rebuilt in 1808. The present building dates from 1842 and the interior from 1882. Chapel records are held by Dyfed Family History Society.

Location The halt is listed in the 1904 Railway Clearing House Handbook of Stations as \\"Camerton Colliery\\". It also appears in three authoritative works, but does not appear in Jowett's railway atlas, nor can it be identified on any Ordnance Survey Map, although both collieries and their connections to Camerton's railways are plain to see.Camerton and its collieries, via National Library of Scotland{ Camerton No. 1 colliery was situated in the valley bottom, north of the river, east of the Cockermouth and Workington Railway station and near that company's line to Cockermouth, to which it was connected. It appears to have closed in the early 1930s. Camerton No. 2 colliery was situated to the north west of the village, on higher ground above the valley next to the road to Seaton, almost 1 km from No.1 Colliery by foot. In February 1890 it was connected to the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway's (C&WJR;) \\"Northern Extension\\" which ran between and via . The specialist work on the line and the specialist work on unadvertised stations agree that the C&WJR; provided the halt. The former does not give a location except in a large scale map, but the latter give its map reference as NY037313 which is where the Flimby Road crosses that company's line, some 650 metres east of No.2 Pit, but slightly nearer No.1 Pit. The line's specialist work omits the halt from its Track Diagrams. Opening and closure The halt opened on 24 March 1887, but its closure is acknowledged as unclear. As it was never publicly advertised standard works such as Bradshaw's Guide are silent. The C&WJR;'s 1920 Working Time Table (WTT) makes no mention of the colliery or the halt. What appears to be the only on line mention of Camerton's collieries appears to suggest that Camerton No.2 was abandoned in 1911, which would explain it not being in the WTT or on OS maps from the 1930s.Abandonment Map Index, via Durham Mining Museum Services Access to a C&WJR; WTT for any date between 1890 and 1910 would give clear evidence of the halt's location and services. History The C&WJR; was built in the late 1870s, being one of the fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century, specifically being born as a reaction to oligopolistic behaviour by the London and North Western and Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railways. It was originally intended to drive the line northwards across country to meet the Caledonian Railway and cross into Scotland by the Solway Viaduct, but an accommodation was made with the LNWR leading to the intended northern extension being greatly watered down to three lines: * a link from to which opened in 1880 * a link from Cloffocks Junction to the CKPR line which opened in March 1885, and * the \\"Northern Extension\\" on the high ground past Camerton to Linefoot. All lines in the area were primarily aimed at mineral traffic, notably iron ore, coal and limestone, none more so than the Northern Extension, which passed through open country. Passenger services were provided calling at Great Broughton, but they were so unsuccessful they petered out after a mere two months. The C&WJR; earned the local name \\"The Track of the Ironmasters\\". The founding Act of Parliament of June 1878 confirmed the company's agreement with the Furness Railway that the latter would operate the line for one third of the receipts. All C&WJR;'s lines were heavily graded. Almost all of the first three miles of the Northern Extension from Calva Junction past Camerton was rising at 1 in 70, with gentler slopes thereafter to the extension's summit at Great Broughton This favoured loaded coal and coke trains heading for Workington.. The Northern Extension became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at the Grouping of 1923. Like any business tied to one or few industries, the C&WJR; was particularly at the mercy of trade fluctuations and technological change. The Cumberland iron industry led the charge in the nineteenth century, but became less and less competitive as time passed and local ore became worked out and harder to win, taking the fortunes of the railway with it. The peak year was 1909, when the C&WJR; handled 1,644,514 tons of freight. Ominously for the line, that tonnage was down to just over 800,000 by 1922, bringing receipts of ¬£83,349, compared with passenger fares totalling ¬£6,570. The high water mark for tonnage on the C&WJR; was 1909, the high water mark for progress was 1913, with the opening of the Harrington and Lowca line for passenger traffic. A chronology of the line's affairs from 1876 to 1992 has almost no entries before 1914 which fail to include \\"opened\\" or \\"commenced\\". After 1918 the position was reversed, when the litany of step-by-step closures and withdrawals was relieved only by a control cabin and a signalbox being erected at Harrington Junction in 1919. The line north of Buckhill was closed in 1921 and subsequently lifted. Buckhill colliery closed in 1932, depriving the line of purpose. Nevertheless, it became a remarkable survivor, because the Admiralty, attracted by a remote area with rail and sea access, chose part of the site of Buckhill Colliery and the surrounding area to build a rail- served armaments depot which opened in 1938 and closed in 1992, taking the line with it. After the closure of the C&WJR; south of Workington Central in 1965 all trains past the site of the halt to the armaments depot travelled south from Siddick Junction past Calva Junction, where they reversed towards Seaton. Afterlife By 2013 the trackbed through the site of the halt was a public off-road trail.

It has been recognized as a Geographical indication by the Government of India in 2005-06. History In the late nineteenth century, competition from British made textiles led Indian weavers to invent new types of garments. In Bhavani, a community of weavers called Jangamars weaved a type of blanket using colored coarse threads called Jamakkalam. The popularity of the product led to the production of jamakkalams by other weavers replacing the production of traditional sarees and other cloths. Types Two types of jamakkalams are produced in Bhavani. The first type is made from coarser cotton threads capable of producing carpets with colored bands. As the thread was coarser, designs could not be weaved on to this type of carpet. Hence, a second softer variety of jamakkalams were introduced that were made of artificial silk threads enabling weavers to weave different kinds of border designs. Jamakkalams are also used to make fashion products such as backpacks. Community Traditionally, jamakkalams were weaved by independent weavers in their houses. Later it moved into a system where jamakkalam is weaved by weavers on hand-looms supervised by master weavers. The master weavers lease hand-looms and contract weavers. The hand- looms are owned by trade merchants who procure raw materials such as thread from neighboring cities of Coimbatore, Salem and Karur. About 1500 workers are involved in the production of jamakkalams with women forming two-thirds of the work force. Weaving loom A pit loom is used to weave jamakkalams. The looms are made of wood with the threads stretched horizontally from end to end. The weaver sits in a pit dug in the ground, on level with the weaving surface. The weaver operates two pedals with his legs while enabling the hands to move the shuttle across to produce the weaving pattern. Exports The jamakkalams manufactured in Bhavani are exported to various countries such as Sweden, Germany, Italy, U.K., U.S. and Singapore. In 1993, Swedish major IKEA started procuring jamakkalams from Bhavani to be sold across its stores. Competition Since the 2000s, the hand weaved jamakkalams from Bhavani have faced competition from power-loom products. The Government of Tamil Nadu offers subsidy to weavers and has enacted laws to outlaw the use of power- looms. The government also sells the blankets through government run Co-optex stores. Competition from blankets produced in Solapur, Maharashtra and cheap imports from neighbors China, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka has resulted in drop in demand for Bhavani jamakkalams. Geographical Indication In 2005, the Government of Tamil Nadu applied for Geographical Indication for Bhavani jamakkalams. The Government of India recognized it as a Geographical indication officially since the year 2005-06.

Planned in mid-December 1969 by the U.S. Ambassador to Laos, the planned interdiction of the newly constructed Chinese Road, Route 46, was aimed at halting the road's progress toward the border with Thailand. The offensive by guerrilla raiders was delayed six months for operational reasons. When it was finally ready to be launched, it was pre-empted by the furor caused by the Cambodian Incursion. Fearful that Operation Snake Eyes would arouse even greater publicity, the Central Intelligence Agency handlers of the guerrillas canceled the operation on orders of the White House. Attempts to limit Chinese expansion toward the south would be left to future operations, such as Operation Phalat and Operation Sourisak Montry. Overview The Kingdom of Laos was freed by the French at the end of the First Indochina War. From its inception, Laos was troubled by a communist insurrection. The United States stepped in to provide foreign aid to Laos, to aid in quelling the uprising.Castle, pp. 9-13. In March 1961, the Geneva Conference of 1954 reconvened with wider participation to reconsider the neutralization of the Kingdom of Laos. Since the 1954 Agreement was signed, a Pathet Lao insurgency had burgeoned, threatening the national sovereignty. This would eventually result in an attempt to settle the Laotian Civil War, the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos signed on 23 July 1962.Stuart-Fox, pp. 118-120. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma curried favor with the People's Republic of China by striking a road construction deal with them in January 1962. The Chinese government committed to building a network of roads connecting Yunnan Province with northern Laos despite the developing Laotian Civil War.Stuart-Fox, p. 56.Conboy, Morrison, p. 313. At the time the agreement was announced, the Battle of Luang Namtha was being fought on the Lao/Chinese border to spark the Laotian Civil War.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 67-73. Background The Chinese originally built a road across northern Phongsali Province in 1962 and 1963 as a foreign aid project. They then began an entirely new road construction project in early 1966, extending south from Yunnan Province past Luang Namtha, down the Pakbeng Valley. As Route 46, the new road gathered ever more attention the further south it progressed. The Royal Thai Government worried it might be extended across trackless northwestern Laos to the Thai border. The presence of 25,000 Chinese troops and 400 antiaircraft guns along the new road raised anxiety not only in the Thai and Lao governments, but also in Washington.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 313, 315, 320. The American government had a vested interest in Thailand; the Kingdom was a major American supporter in the ongoing Vietnam War.Kislenko, Arne, Summer 2004. \\"A Not So Silent Partner. Thailand's Role in Covert Operations, Counter-Insurgencey, and the Wars in Indochina\\", The Journal of Conflict Studies, Volume XXIV No. 1, pp. 1-25. Operation In mid-December 1969, U.S. Ambassador G. McMurtrie Godley had suggested that the Central Intelligence Agency's guerrilla forces might block Route 46. Three guerrillas platoons from Nam Yu were infiltrated 50 kilometers south of Luang Namtha to spy on the road construction; they were dubbed Teams 37A, 37B, and 37C. Even though Godley was in charge of all U.S. military and paramilitary activity in the Secret War, his aggressive suggestion was rejected in Washington. He countered with a plan to scale the suggested Operation Snake Eyes back to a passive road watch program spying on Chinese activities. His argument for the operation was that if the U.S. did not take action to support its allies in the war, they might act unilaterally. In January 1970, as the road watch proposal was being bruited about in Washington, two Thai mercenary pilots of the Royal Lao Air Force bombed a Chinese convoy on Route 46, destroying 15 trucks.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 315-316. A week later, in response to the Thai bombing, the original Snake Eyes proposal to block Route 46 was approved, but with one proviso: Laotian Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma would have to cease waffling and publicly oppose the road construction to give justification for the attack.Conboy, Morrison, p. 315. As events turned out, Operation Snake Eyes was put on hold for six months so that it would begin in the rainy season against a skeleton crew of Chinese workers. It would be supported by the Royal Thai Air Force. CIA-sponsored hill tribes road watch teams augmented by Chinese Nationalists from nearby Burma would spy on the builders in the meantime. In the meantime, a company of Commando Raiders was recruited in Luang Prabang and trained to monitor the road. They took up road watch duties in June 1970.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 314-315. When the time rolled around to stage Operation Snake Eyes, two separate guerrilla units were poised for a pincer movement. The Nam Yu contingent already had the three teams in place, and would push southeast to join them. A second unit would move west from the direction of Luang Prabang, under the command of Captain Xieng Manh Noy Sirisouk. When Operation Snake Eyes was again scheduled, the Cambodian Incursion intervened. There was such public furor over that invasion that the White House decided not to risk further publicity by staging Snake Eyes. After all this hesitation, Sirisouk was primed for combat. He was disgusted with the latest postponement order, angry at his CIA advisor, and refused to return the unit's weapons to the adviser. He marched his troops on the royal capital of Luang Prabang, then veered off short to cross the Mekong River and encamp them on an obscure mountaintop. Operation Snake Eyes ended when Captain Sirisouk quit the Laotian Civil War because of the White House order.Conboy, Morrison, p. 316. Aftermath The failure to launch Operation Snake Eyes to check Route 46's extension south led to the later necessity for operations to defend the Thai border, such as Operation Phalat and Operation Sourisak Montry.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 318-319.

He is currently professor of citizen participation at the University of Essex and emeritus professor of social policy at Brunel University London. Much of his work has centred on including the viewpoints, lived experience and knowledge of disabled people, mental health and other long term service users in public policy, practice and learning. Biography=Childhood and Education= Peter Beresford was born in Frensham, Surrey. After his father died when he was four, he moved to Battersea where he attended school at Wix's Lane Primary School, Battersea and then Emanuel School London. He was awarded an 'Open Exhibition' to University College, Oxford, where from 1964-67 he studied Modern History. In 1968 he wrote a dissertation on homeless single people as part of a diploma in social and administrative studies at Barnet House, Oxford University and subsequently did research on vagrancy in Britain. He was awarded a PhD on Citizen Involvement in Public Policy by Middlesex University in 1997. =Personal life= Peter Beresford married Suzy Croft in 1976. They have worked and written together since that time. She is senior social worker at St John‚Äôs Hospice, London. They have four daughters. He is also a member of the BSA (motorcycle) Owners Club. Life and work Between 1975 and 1977 Beresford was lecturer in Social Administration at Lancaster University, but left because of his growing concerns about the non-participatory nature of public policy. He was appointed senior lecturer in Social Policy at the West London Institute for Higher Education (WLIHE) in 1990. WLIHE was absorbed into Brunel University London where he was promoted to Professor of Social Policy in 1997. Together he and his partner, Suzy Croft, established a local community project, Battersea Community Action, in 1978 and a national initiative, the Open Services Project, in 1987. Each of these were participatory projects concerned with advancing the theory, policy and practice of participation through the production of publications, pamphlets and developmental research. In 1997, he founded and began directing the first UK Centre for Citizen Participation. A major theme of Beresford's work has been the participation of people as members of the public, workers, patients and service users in their lives, communities, society and in services affecting them. Much of his work has focused on advancing public participation, and the involvement and empowerment of long term users of health and social care. He has long term personal experience of using mental health services and also of the welfare benefits system. This resulted in his close involvement in the disabled people's and psychiatric system survivors movements. He is also actively involved in Disability Studies and Mad Studies. Beresford's theoretical policy and practical concern has been how disabled people and other long term health and social care service users can be equally involved in society and have an effective voice in their lives. This focus has resulted in the exploration of new approaches to occupational practice, policy formation, research and evaluation and the political process. It has also extended to the development of new approaches to epistemology which highlight the role of service users' lived experience as a knowledge source. Beresford was also co-founder and chair (and subsequently co-chair) of Shaping Our Lives, the independent, national disabled people's and service users‚Äô organisation and network that is committed to improving the quality of support available to service users and increasing their say and control over their lives. Shaping Our Lives has pioneered the development of user involvement in professional education and also of user controlled research. It has been the UK partner of PowerUs, an international partnership to take forward this work. He has been a trustee of the Social Care Institute for Excellence, the National Skills Academy for Social Care and Skills For Care as well as being a member of government advisory groups and committees. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2008 New Year's honours list, ‚Äòfor services to social care‚Äô. He was appointed Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in 2006. He is emeritus professor at Brunel University London, visiting professor at Edge Hill University and the University of East Anglia and Fellow of the School of Social Care Research. Since December 2015, he has been professor of citizen participation at the University of Essex. He is Executive Editor of the leading disability peer reviewed journal, Disability & Society. In July 2017, Beresford was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Science (Hon.D.Sc.) by Edge Hill University '‚Äòin recognition of his distinguished academic and professional career within the fields of social work, social policy and citizen participation\\".  Awards  Beresford is identified as an award-winning leader in social work and social care: * He was voted 2nd for social care in poll of the \\"Top 100 people in Health and Social Care\\" in 2005. * He has been identified as one of the \\"Power 100 Britain‚Äôs Most Influential People with a Disability or Impairment\\" by the Shaw Trust in 2015 and 2016, identified as one of disabled academic * He is identified as the 2nd most influential person in social care for adults and 9th overall in a Community Care survey of the \\"Top 20 Most Influential People in Social Care\\". Beresford's work was described as ‚Äòextremely useful and inspirational‚Äô. * He was awarded the FusePR Award for Research of Social Impact for examining the barriers facing disabled people. * He was awarded 1st place in the National Conference for University Professors Essay Prize in association with Times Higher Education Supplement in 2004.

Gregoriana was initiated by Reinier van der Lof in 2002. Since its foundation Gregoriana has been directed by Geert Maessen.The first years of the ensemble are sketched in Zijlstra (2004). Since 2006 Gregoriana also has a female branch, initially called Virga. Gregoriana‚Äôs home is the Amsterdam Obrechtchurch where every third Saturday of the month (except in July and August) at 17:00 Gregorian Vespers (or Meditations) are sung.  Notation and repertoire  Gregoriana preferably sings from the so-called Fluxus notation, a musical notation in which the oldest, tenth-century notation is placed on lines.See Zeegers & Hakkennes (1998) for an early discussion of this notation and Maessen (2011) for an edition. Unlike more common notations, in the Fluxus notation all nuances (rhythmic, stylistic and ornamental) remain readable in an obvious way. Gregoriana is particularly fascinated by those parts of the repertory which are rarely performed, but may nevertheless be regarded constitutive for the repertoire: the great responsories of the Night Office and the offertories with verses.A critical study of over 900 responsories is Helsen (2008). On the Cantusdatabase over 100 medieval Office manuscripts are indexed. An online edition is Dominique Crochu, both sites accessed 28 January 2016.A comparison and edition with Old Roman offertories is Maloy (2010). A handsome online edition is Anton Stingl, accessed 28 January 2016. Over 2,000 medieval responsories are preserved. In these chants the Gregorian composition techniques are reflected in an exemplary manner. In the verses of the approximately 100 tenth-century offertories, the most virtuoso parts of Gregorian chant can be found, which among other things is reflected in the longest melismas, the largest ambitus and most text repetitions.See Hankeln (2007). Gregoriana has also paid special attention to the contemporaneous repertoires that were mostly eliminated by the standardization of Gregorian chant.See Hiley (1993) 524-562 and McKinnon (2000). Some of these repertoires, however, may be much older and at the base of Gregorian chant. Notably: Old Roman, Ambrosian (Milanese), (Old) Beneventan, Gallican and Mozarabic chant. In particular, Mozarabic chant is high on Gregoriana‚Äôs priority list. This tradition existed from the sixth to the eleventh century on the Iberian Peninsula and southern France, but was officially abolished and replaced by Gregorian chant in 1085.Rojo and Prado (1929), Fern√°ndez de la Cuesta et al. (2013). Over 5000 chants of this tradition have been preserved in pitch- unreadable musical notation only.Randel (1973). Gregoriana has performed dozens of computer aided reconstructions of Mozarabic chant.Maessen (2015) 237-260.  Cooperation, publications and radio  Gregoriana has worked with imams, chazans and other representatives of several religions, as well as musicians from several musical traditions; classical, improvised and folkloristic.See Vroom-Barnard (2009). Gregoriana has released eight CDs, including two in collaboration with the Egidius Kwartet. Additionally Gregoriana has published five books, including Calculemus et Cantemus about the lost Mozarabic tradition. From 2010 to 2016 Gregoriana's director has compiled radio broadcasts on Gregorian chant for the Dutch Concertzender.Lists and streams are available at Gregoriana and Concertzender both accessed 28 January 2016. Many of these programs were about closely related traditions to Gregorian chant. All episodes can be streamed on the internet.

Akshar II is an American Republican politician from the State of New York. Since November 2015, Akshar has represented District 52 in the New York State Senate. Background Akshar grew up in Afton the Southern Tier region of New York. He graduated from Broome Community College as well as the FBI Academy. A law enforcement officer, Akshar worked at the Chenango County Sheriff's Office and the Broome County Sheriff's Office. His work in law enforcement spanned 15 years, and he served as Captain of the Law Enforcement Division at the Broome County Sheriff's Office. Akshar was named undersheriff of Broome County in June 2015. Prior to his election to the New York State Senate, he also served on the Crime Victims Assistance Center Board and the Broome Opioid Abuse Council. New York State Senate In 2015, long-serving State Senator Tom Libous forfeited his Senate seat after being found guilty of lying to the federal authorities. As a result, a special election was called in Senate District 52, and the Republican Party nominated Akshar (a political novice) to replace Libous. While Democrats targeted the seat and ran former Broome County Executive Barbara Fiala against him, Akshar received nearly 78% of the vote and defeated Fiala easily. He was re-elected in 2016 and 2018. In July 2018, Akshar's staff confirmed that Akshar was \\"in a relationship with Jessica Williams, who until last week was on Akshar's payroll as his director of administration.\\" A report indicated that Williams had \\"received eight salary increases and three promotions during her roughly 2¬Ω years on Akshar's payroll, rising from a part-timer making $32,600 in 2015 to a full-timer making $85,000 today\\". Akshar was appointed chair of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee in December 2018, replacing Sen. Catharine Young. Young had attempted to oust Senate Republican Leader John J. Flanagan from his leadership position in November 2018, and Akshar had supported Flanagan. In January 2019, The New York Times noted Akshar's frustration with the continuing push for transgender rights; when \\"State Senator Jessica Ramos...said lawmakers should go even further to help transgender New Yorkers,\\" Akshar responded, \\"Jesus Christ! Further?\\" On January 23, 2019, Akshar voted against the NY DREAM Act, which passed both houses of the State Legislature. The bill would extend state financial aid to undocumented immigrant students who were brought to the United States as children. Personal life During his 2015 campaign for New York State Senate, Akshar's opponent accused him of unethical behavior in connection with a 2009 motor vehicle accident involving the nephew of his then-girlfriend, Kate Newcomb. Akshar denied wrongdoing, and no charges were filed following an investigation. In November 2016, PressConnects.com described Kate Newcomb, a captain in the Broome County Sheriff's Office, as Akshar's longtime girlfriend. As of July 2018, Akshar was dating former staffer Jessica Williams. He announced his engagement to Jessica Fiacco (also known as Jessica Williams) in December 2018. In April 2019, Akshar was accused of engaging in an inappropriate relationship with the mother of a murder victim. At that time, Akshar acknowledged having had a \\"brief, consensual relationship\\" with Mirella Masciarelli some years earlier. Masciarelli was the mother of Mario Masciarelli, whose 2013 murder Akshar had helped to investigate; Akshar also testified at a pretrial hearing in the case. Masciarelli described Akshar as a \\"predator\\" who \\"'interjected himself into [her] life in a way that...was not professional as a captain in the Broome County Sheriff's Office'\\" and took advantage of her grief over the loss of her son. Akshar denied any wrongdoing and accused Masciarelli of engaging in an \\"attempted smear campaign\\". As of January 2019, Akshar resides in Endwell, New York.

Cicilia is married to Barbara Rubio, the older sister of U.S. Senator Marco Rubio. Drug ring The federal indictment alleged that the ring had been in operation for some 10 years, smuggling $75 million worth of cocaine and marijuana into Louisiana and Florida. It also alleged that members of the ring had become aware that one of their group, Larry Nash, had become an informer for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms. Nash was murdered, and his body was cut up with a chainsaw and burned. Cecilia, described as a \\"second-tier associate\\" of the drug ring's kingpin, Mario Tabraue, was sentenced to 25 years in prison; Cecilia was released in 2000, after serving 12 years and also being an informant. Mario recently appeared, commenting on the murder, in the Netflix series Tiger King. Univision Cicilia's wife, Barbara, is the sister of Marco Rubio, who was in high school at the time Cicilia was arrested. In 2011, Rubio, was a United States Senator whose name was frequently mentioned as a Vice-Presidential nominee on the Republican ticket, and Univision wanted one of its star journalists, Gerardo Reyes, to tape an in-depth Rubio interview. In the course of negotiations over the interview, Rubio's staff learned that Univision had uncovered the details of Cicilia's history as a drug dealer, and asked Univision not to broadcast it, arguing that it was an unfair intrusion into the lives of private citizens. Reyes argued that since Rubio had made his personal story part of his political campaigns, it was legitimate to explore how the arrest had shaped Rubio's life and career. Ultimately, Rubio refused to do the interview, and, in July 2011, Reyes broadcast the story of Cicilia's arrest on Univision. Three months later the Miami Herald ran a detailed report on Cicilia's arrest and Rubio's attempt to kill the Univision story by Marc Caputo and Manny Garcia \\"The inside story: Univision's war with Rubio over immigration and drug story\\" on page one. The Herald alleged that Univision had offered to kill or soften the story about the Senator's brother-in-law if Rubio would do an interview with Jorge Ramos on Al Punto. Writing in the Columbia Journalism Review, Erika Fry concludes that several aspects of the Herald's assertion that Univision offered a quid pro quo, \\"don't add up.\\" Real estate license Cicilia's criminal past came back into the headlines in 2015, when, with Rubio running for the Republican Presidential nomination, the Washington Post revealed that while he was majority whip of the Florida State Legislature Rubio wrote a letter of recommendation supporting Cecilia's application for a Florida Real Estate license. Rubio did not mention in the letter that Cicilia is his brother-in-law. Failing to disclose the relationship in the letter is not illegal, but can be construed as a conflict of interest. Ex-convicts are permitted to hold Florida real estate licenses.

His work is mostly influenced by his graffiti background. He started painting around 1989 in his neighborhood mostly on train tracks and highway walls. \\"Eltono focused mainly on the railway lines to the northwest of the city, painting in the traditional silver and black, block letter Parisian style.\\" He lived in Madrid from 1999 to 2010 (where he got his pseudonym), then in Beijing from 2010 to 2014 and since 2014 lives in the south of France. In 1999, while living in Madrid, he started painting abstract symbols with tape and acrylic paint. \\"It was then that he developed the colorful geometric box patterns for which he is now known.\\" \\"As Eltono himself suggested, his move away from traditional graffiti was produced so as to find a harmony with both the material and the social body of the city (integrating both its architectonic and societal elements in a more consensual manner).\\" \\"Eltono also rejects conventional letterforms in favor of a minimalism device with which to negotiate space.\\" Eltono's work is mainly influenced by the urban environment and questions the limits between public and private space. He uses the term \\"public space artist\\" to describe his practice. When showing his work in galleries and museums, he focuses on finding a coherent way to show street art in private spaces. \\"[Eltono's] career in both the street and the galleries [], is an example of a certain ethic of sustained work, oblivious to everything, which creates its own parameters and builds its own audience.\\" He has collaborated with artists such as MOMO (artist), Nuria Mora (http://nuriamora.com/), Luce and is part of Equipo Pl√°stico art collective (alongside Nuria Mora, Nano4814 and Sixeart) and Noviciado9 (alongside 3ttman, Remed, Spok, Nano4814 and Luciano Suarez).

Protection in this sense means guaranteeing the confidentiality, integrity, and the availability of the information stored in the system (\\"SYSTEM\\"), and its elements or components. Unlike endpoint security, network security, web application security, and Internet security, Fabric of Security Systems assume that attacks will be successful, and cannot be averted. Therefore, the emphasis shifts from attempting to prevent unauthorized access to that of minimizing the time to detect the unauthorized access, the time to isolate the unauthorized access from doing harm, and finally, the time to remove the offending process and reconfiguration of the system back into a \\"SAFE\\" state. Security essentials Security refers to processes and systems designed to protect the assets of an individual, system and/or organization from harm. Computer Security (a.k.a. cyber security) refers to processes and systems designed to protect computer and/or information system assets from harm. In general, such assets are: (1) information/ data, (2) programs and applications, and (3) services. Protecting assets from harm means: Confidentiality ‚Äì assets are used/access only by authorized parties (also refer to as secrecy or privacy) Integrity ‚Äì assets can be modified only by authorized parties and only in authorize ways (‚Äúinsider threat‚Äù) Availability ‚Äì assets are available to authorize parties at time to. =Lampson's Protection Model= In 1971, Butler Lampson in his now classical paper Protection, introduced the general model of protection of computer or information system assets which has withstood the passage of time. By enlarge, all protection systems implemented to date follow Lampson's original formulation shown here in Figure 1 entitled \\"Access Control Model of Protection\\". Fundamentally the universe is divided into two classes Principals, who access Resources. A Resource is an object for which a protection policy has been established. Access to Objects is restricted via a protection system, called a reference monitor, that implements the protection policies of the system. Namely the reference monitor or \\"Guard System\\" must: (1) identifies the identity of the Principal claiming access to an object - Principal is identity, (2) authentication - validates that the Principal claiming access to an object is who he/she/it claims to be, and (3) authorization - is the principal claiming access to an object authorized to access said object. Attack timeline and actionsFabric of security principles and architecture In the past, the protection model that most organizations applied to protect their infrastructure was simply the \\"Everything but the Kitchen Sink\\" model‚Äîmeaning, add devices that protect the enterprise network perimeter (Trusted Zone), add devices that protect mobile devices, add devices that protect the database. In essence, this model simply advocated for the accumulation of security devices. As pointed out earlier, see section 1.0, this model has failed. In addition, the idea that cyber- attacks can be stopped at the periphery of the network has become a fool's errand. In today's circa 2020 computing environment and cyber-threat landscape, individuals as well as corporations have recognized the fact that (i) threats are often distributed in nature both in time and space, making detection extremely difficult, and (ii) the working assumption is not that the user can prevent infections (the goal of 100% prevention is no longer practical), but rather, given that the user's \\"system\\" will be compromised, how quickly can the user detect the breach and how does the user minimize the impact of such an event? In the future, the basis of competition for security products and services will be the ability to provide early warnings and execute countermeasures that minimize damage from cyber-attackers. The problem is not about single or even multiple independent security devices each providing some amount of absolute protection. Rather, information from all the user's security products and services need to be correlated, scrutinized and transformed into wide-angle actionable information in order to minimize the most likely threats of damage by cyber-attackers in the user's specific enterprise environment, see Figure 3. We call this approach the ‚ÄúFabric of Security.‚Äù It is a layered model that easily accommodates distributed deployment of security in multi-vendor environments. =FOSA Architecture= In 2013, the Wireless Systems Security Research Laboratory (WSSRL) started the development of a first-reference implementation of the Fabric of Security called FOSA. The purpose of FOSA was to use proven techniques from the areas of distributed processing, computer architecture and clustering algorithms, to build a viable, real-time security system capable of protecting the corporate infrastructure of the Circa 2020 computing model. FOSA was intended to be the first implementation of the Fabric of Security architecture, while at the same time remedying some of the limitations of current security system implementations. Specifically, the stated goal for the design was to avoid stand-alone solutions while incorporating the ability to deal with reliability issues, meaning, the best security product/solution is no good if either it fails to operate as specified (Fault Tolerant) and/or is compromised by the attacker (Resilient to Attacks). It must be able to withstand attacks directly against itself, and be able to protect itself from being compromised or disabled. Description of the FOSA Architecture In this section, we provide a brief overview of the FOSA system and its major components. However, in this manuscript we will not cover the reliability and adaptability elements of the architecture, and the use of Byzantine Agreement, see [4], to build resiliency into the system. Fabric Of Security Architectural Layers Fabric of Security Architecture The architecture of FOSA is shown here in Figure 4. FOSA is a distributed system based on layer component architecture. In each FOSA node, a set of components in a hierarchical structure provide the traditional security functions found in most implementations. At the lowest level of the hierarchy, Layer0, we find the traditional data gathering component or SENSORS/Probes. Unlike other systems, SENSORS in FOSA can be custom data collectors or simply gather data from other security systems, such as FIREWALLS, and AV systems. In the latter case, SENSORS gather the data by monitoring the output of a variety of systems outputs, such as Snort, and the syslog file on Linux. The data collected by the SENSORS serve as input to the next layer in the hierarchy, Layer1, the S-Event Generator or SEG. The SEGs function as a data abstraction layer. They collect the data from the SENSORS, filter it, convert it into a platform independent format, and provide the aggregated, filtered data to the next layer of the hierarchy, the Secure Host Manager or SHM in the form of events. The events are queued for further analysis by the SHM. In addition to this, the SEGs start and stop the SENSORS. In this context, the SHM can be consider as the local IDS/IPS that makes decisions about all activities that it monitors both host- or network-based. A critical component of the SHM is the Analysis Engine AE. The AE retrieves events from the Event Queue, processes them, and makes a final determination as to the probability that a successful attack will be launched, and/or an attack is in progress at the local level. This probability falls into one of three ranges. These are: 0 ‚â§ p{Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } ‚â§ Œ¶1 - No ATTACK Œ¶1 ‚â§ p{ Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } ‚â§ Œ¶2 - There is insufficient data at the local level to make a decision. In addition, in some situations this is an indication that the local node has been compromised. Œ¶2 ‚â§ p { Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } - ATTACK detected In the first case, the SHM is sure that the events processed do not represent an attack or elements of an Attack, and therefore the system continues operation without further actions. However, in the next two cases a potential attack has taken place or is in progress. In such a case, the SHM immediately initiates countermeasures. The first of which is to stop all further processing of events, disable all remote access to the node, and notify the next level of the hierarchy, the Distributed Threat Intelligence Manager/Engine (DTIM), that a potential failure or attack is in the making. Further, in the case that the SHM is sure the host has been compromised, then, the SHM also sends a ‚Äúlast gasp‚Äù message to the DTIM. Once it sends the ‚Äúlast gasp‚Äù message, the SHM stops the SEGs, stops processing data from the SEGs and launches countermeasures to restore the node to a healthy state. 2.1.2 Distributed Threat Intelligence Manager/Engine (DTIM) As previously mentioned, FOSA is a real-time, distributed system based on the concept of autonomous agents. Its structure is similar to the architecture proposed in the AAFID system. However, it differs from it in at least three significant ways. These are: # It is fault resilient. It can protect itself from traditional hardware and software failures, as well as malicious attacks. # It has a learning engine capable of integrating new knowledge into its decision matrix. # Attack Detection/ Prevention occurs at two levels. At the local level, SHM represents the traditional IDS/IPS system. However, decisions that affect the health of the entire system, or decisions concerning a distributed attack, are made by correlating information among all security devices in the system using a Byzantine Agreement Protocols or BAP. In the architecture, the Distributed Threat Intelligence Engine/Manager (DTIM) consists of two major components: (1) the Distributed Trust Manager (DTM) which performs the critical functions of Fault Tolerance and Attack Resilience, and (2) the Distributed Threat Intelligence Correlation Engine (TICE) that performs the function of Threat and Event detection globally. 2.1.2.1 Distributed Trust Manager (DTM) The DTM performs several essential functions. These are: * Formation and maintenance of a ‚ÄúTrust Domain‚Äù(TD). The TD is a network of trusted security devices that have been deemed ‚Äúsafe.‚Äù Roughly, ‚Äúsafe‚Äù means that all nodes are running the same/latest revision of software and hardware, they have not been compromised and they have obtained a unique identifier or token certifying their identity to the Trust Domain * Delivery of a ‚Äúlast gasp‚Äù message to other nodes in the TD * Using Byzantine Agreement, and upon receipt of a ‚Äúlast gasp‚Äù message, the DTM initiates the determination as to the presence or absence of an attack/intrusion; * In the case that an attack/intrusion has been confirmed, the DTIM is responsible for removing the offending node from the TD, issuing the necessary countermeasures and re-constituting the TD with the remaining nodes in the system * Finally, the DTM prevents the Trust Domain from being partitioned. The creation of a Trust Domain and the formation of an initial group have been discussed in a previous work, see [2] in detail. However, because nodes can be compromised and their status can change over time, the DTIM must have the capability of expelling members and reconfiguring itself. This process of reconfiguration is initiated by either the receipt of a ‚Äúlast gasp‚Äù message from a member or when the DTM reconfiguration timer expires. The basic process works as follows. Upon receipt of a ‚Äúlast gasp‚Äù message, every node in the Trust Domain will initiate the reconfiguration by: ‚Ä¢ Sending a set of test patterns to the node suspected of being compromised. The test pattern matrix consists of a set of known intrusion vectors, as well as a set of non- intrusion patterns. Upon formation of the initial group, and every time that membership in the Trusted Domain changes, the matrix is reconstituted and distributed among all members. The matrix is distributed in such a way that no single member group of members colluding (as long as k, k N-1)/ 2; where k is number of colluding members), has complete knowledge of all test patterns * Each member of the TD will record its opinion of the suspected node based on answers received * All members of the Trust Domain, except for the suspected node, initiate the BAP, and arrive at a consensus as the status of the suspected node * Based on the consensus decision, the necessary countermeasures will be invoked, and the offending node isolated for either manual or automatic repair 2.1.2.2 Distributed Trust Manager component of the DTIM in FOSA- An Abstract Model One of the key components of the Distributed Threat Intelligence Manager/Engine is the Distributed Trust manager of DTM. The DTM is built upon the principles of replication, consensus, and the ‚Äùwisdom of crowds.‚Äù In order to understand the behaviors of the FOSA system, it is important that an abstract model of the Trust Domain (TD) is presented. Here we present such a model. Let M = {C, Cnew, P, X, Œ±}, be an abstract representation for a Trust Domain. This model allows us to reason as to the correctness of the DTM component of the Threat Intelligence/Engine. One potential side benefit of the model is that it will allow us to identify holes in our design. The basic components of the model, C, P, X, and Œ± are defined below. C = {c1, c2, c3, ..., cn}, for some finite integer n, is the set of nodes in the Trust Domain. A node within this context is any Security Device that is collecting data and making decisions about the possibility of an attack. While n could be very large, for practical purposes associated with the implementation of DTM, we limit n to 16. cnew = cj cj ‚àà/ C, which is a node that is trying to join a Trust Domain. The state, w, of cnew is unknown at the time that cnew declares its intention to join a Trust Domain. That is, cnew may be a node whose behavior is in accordance with the Trust Domain admission and security policies (‚Äúuncompromised node‚Äù) or it may be compromised. Œ± = {Œ±1, Œ±2, Œ±3, ..., Œ±m} is the set of actions that a node may perform. A node is essentially a deterministic finite automaton. Thus, it has a finite set of states, a finite set of input symbols and a transition function [3]. The transition function is analogous to the set of actions a node may take based on the input the node receives. Since the input alphabet is finite and the number of states is finite, the set of actions, Œ±, which a node may take, is finite. P = {p1, p2, p3, ..., pk} is a security policy which describes the acceptable behaviors of a Security Device in the Trust Domain. Each pi is a rule composed of a subject, an object and an action that the subject may perform on the object. We note that security policies are rarely defined completely, as it is difficult to list every possible rule that is acceptable. Thus, we accept that we will have to add new rules to the policy as new acceptable actions that a node may perform on an object are discovered. It should be clear that P ‚äÜ Œ±. We also note that ¬¨P ‚à™ P = Œ±. X is a capability matrix, which indicates what actions the subjects can perform on the objects and/or on each other. The subjects here are the nodes. The objects are the data and the services running on the nodes. Xij represents all the actions that subject subjecti can perform on object objectj . In other words, for each object oj on computer nodek, Xij gives the set of actions, Œ±l ‚àà Œ± that computer nodek can execute on behalf of subjecti on object 0j . Using this model, we defined a capability and policy matrix for our experimental Trust Domain, see Figure 5, with corresponding security policy P ={p1, p2, p3, ..., pk } below. 2.1.2.3 Security Policy We define several variables and constants that are necessary to define the security policy, P. The variables are: OSi =the current operating version on nodei FOSAi = FOSA software version nodei responsei,x = the response nodei gives to nodex in the TD when it is interrogated opinioni,x = the belief of nodex in the TD about whether nodei is compromised majorityi,x = the majority belief of all the nodes in the TD about whether nodei is com- promised after the parallel Signed Message Algorithm has been completed messageTamperedi = whether messagei has been tampered with The constants present in the security policy are: OST = the minimum acceptable O/S version for a node to join the TD FOSAT = the minimum acceptable version of the FOSA software responsec = the correct response of a node to an interrogation compromised = the majority belief that the node trying to join the TD is compromised uncompromised= the majority belief that the node trying to join the TD is safe Using this model, we defined a capability and policy matrix for our experimental Trust Domain, see Figure 5. The corresponding security policy P ={p1, p2, p3, ..., pk } is defined below. Based on these definitions, the security policy can be described as follows: p1: Given a node, ci ‚àà Cnew, that is attempting to join a TD, then, if the value of OSi < OST, then ci is not allowed to join TD p2: Given a node, ci ‚àà Cnew, that is attempting to join a TD, then, if the value of SAFEi < SAFET, then ci is not allowed to join TD p3: Given a node, ci ‚àà Cnew, that is attempting to join a TD, and a node cx in the TD, then, if the value of responsei,x = responsec, then opinioni,x = compromised p4: Given a node, ci ‚àà Cnew, that is attempting to join a TD, and a node cx in the TD, then, if the value of responsei,x = responsec, then opinioni,x = uncompromised p5: Given a set of nodes, c1, ..., cx, in a TD, a node ci not in TD, and a majorityi,x = compromised, then, cx does not open a socket connection to ci (preventing ci to join TD). p6: Given a set of nodes, c1, ..., cx, in a TD, a node ci not in TD, and a majorityi,x = uncompromised, then, cx opens a socket connection to ci (thus allowing ci is to join TD). p7: Given nodes cx and cy are nodes in a TD, and cx receives messagei from cy, such that messageTamperedi = T rue, then, cx discards messagei as if it was never received. 2.1.3 Threat Intelligence Correlation Engine (TICE) TICE or the Threat Intelligence Correlation Engine is a global engine whose inputs are the events generated by the SHM module at a lower level of the hierarchy, local information as to the configuration of the environment under protection, global information as to the current threat level in the particular region and the corresponding and pertinent threat landscape at the time of the events. The output of TICE is threat evaluations, actionable intelligence, and threat countermeasure recommendations. Similar to its lower level counterparts at Layer2 - the SHM, TICE evaluates & correlates events and ascertains the correlation of such events into three distinct possibilities: 0 ‚â§ p{Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } ‚â§ Œ¶1 - No ATTACK/Intrusion Œ¶1 ‚â§ p{ Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } ‚â§ Œ¶2 - Insufficient Data Œ¶2 ‚â§ p { Attack in Progress or a Compromise has occurred } - Attack/ Intrusion present The values of Œ¶1 and Œ¶2 are tunable. 2.1.4 Logging and Presentation Services - Issuance of Countermeasures (LAPIS) LAPIS represents the top layer of the architecture, and it is the module where actionable intelligence is presented to an administrator for further action and/or where automatic countermeasures are issued throughout the protected environment. In the simplest implementation of the FOSA architecture, LATIS is the equivalent of a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) module. It provides visual information to the security officer/administrator as to the state, real time threats that have been detected and the overall integrity of the protected environment. Typical SIEM capabilities such as: (1) Security Event Management (SEM), (2) File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), (3) Configuration Management Database (CMDB), and (4) Availability and Performance Monitoring (APM) are part of this layer. However, unlike your typical SIEM, the LAPIS layer provides for automatic countermeasure generation, repair and recovery, as well as manual mode where forensics and countermeasure issuance is based on a probabilistic model with tunable Œ¶1 and Œ¶2 parameters.

The calvary at Plougastel-Daoulas is a listed historical monument since 1889. Calvaire  The parish church of Saint-Pierre  The church was built in 1870 and designed by Joseph Bigot. Badly damaged by Allied bombing on 22 and 23 August 1944 during the push to capture Brest it was restored and partially rebuilt and re- commissioned in 1950. A new master altar made from Mayenne marble was executed by Dom de Laborde, a monk from Solesmes Abbey, and consecrated on 2 September 1957. Notable furnishings in the church include  The Rosary altarpiece  This can be seen in the south transept area and was executed by the Brest sculptor Jean Berthouloux in 1654 to 1656. Four twisted columns support a pediment with a niche holding a sculpted study of Sainte Anne and her daughter the Virgin Mary. The central panel of the altarpiece has the 15 medallions, painted and in high-relief which traditionally form part of Rosary altarpieces and in niches in the base are statues of Christ holding a book and Gamaliel.  The altarpiece of the Saint Pierre altar  This 17th-century altarpiece also has four twisted columns and an arched pediment with a niche holding a statue of Christ holding a globe. In the centre is a statue of Saint Pierre and seven polychrome medallions. Further panels on the column's socles have depictions of the Angel Gabriel and Saint Mark on the right side and the Virgin of the Annunciation and Saint Matthew on the left. These sculptures are also by Jean Berthouloux.  The Notre Dame de Piti√© altarpiece  This altarpiece dates to 1651 and panelling has a depiction of the crowning of the Virgin Mary in the centre.  Baptismal fonts  These date to the 16th- century and came from a church at Meilars. The basin is decorated with six carved panels.  Stoup  The church has a 1715 stoup in kersanton stone with godrons carved on the sides.  Stations of the Cross  The church has a \\"chemin de croix\\" dating to the 20th century by an artist called des Abbayes.  Notre Dame de Piti√©  See gallery of images below.

Australis is widely considered responsible for popularizing barramundi to North America. History Australis CEO Josh Goldman first began experimenting with closed-containment aquaculture in the 1980s, when he was a student at Hampshire College. After graduating, he founded one of the first commercial aquaponics farms, and went on to spend the next fifteen years in commercialize closed containment-farming technology as an entrepreneur and consultant. In the early 2000s, Goldman spent three years prospecting for new types of fish to farm and was introduced to barramundi by an Australian entrepreneur. After testing over 30 species of fish in order to determine which was optimal for aquaculture, Goldman chose barramundi because of its low environmental impact and ability to breed in captivity, in addition to what he believed to be an appealing taste and exceptional nutritional value. The company was founded in 2004 in Turners Falls, Massachusetts, where it first began producing barramundi using recirculating aquaculture system technology in Western Massachusetts. Although Australis was able to raise barramundi successfully, one of the largest challenges the company faced was popularizing a relatively unknown fish in the American market. Goldman said: ‚ÄúWe were reaching out and building relationship with top chefs who were passionate about sustainability, dietitians who were trying to get people to eat more fish (but often worried about contaminants), and environmentalists whose mission was to protect the oceans.‚Äù In 2004 Australis Aquaculture established its first barramundi farm in Turner Falls, Massachusetts. In 2007, the company expanded its production into Van Phong Bay, in central Vietnam. In September 2018, Australis sold one of its US farms to Great Falls Aquaculture.Lauren Kramer, Smaller RAS farms say size isn‚Äôt everything, Aquaculturealliance.org, 24 February 2020 Activities Australis once used Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) technology in their land-locked Turner Falls facility to raise barramundi. Australis‚Äô Vietnamese operation uses a combination of on-shore closed containment tanks with off-shore cages in the open ocean. Australis harvests and processes their fish, selling under its own brand, as well as private labels. The company‚Äôs Vietnamese facility produces primary flash frozen filets which are sold to foodservice distributors and prominent retailers, including the restaurant French Laundry which first carried Australis Barramundi in 2008, Whole Foods and HelloFresh.Matt Craze, Australis Barramundi, Vietnam, Undercurrentnews.com, 15 August 2019 Environmental impact Part of the barramundi‚Äôs sustainability comes from the fact that it can be raised on a predominantly plant-based protein diet without sacrificing the nutritional benefits of the product. According to The Atlantic, ‚Äúthey have the rare ability to transform vegetarian feed into sought-after omega-3 fatty acids. Salmon require as much as three pounds of fish-based feed to put on a pound of meat. Goldman‚Äôs barramundi need only a half pound, the bulk of which is made from scraps from a herring processing plant.‚Äù The founder Josh Goldman also launched the venture Greener Grazing he launched to develop Asparagopsis cultures to feed livestock and significantly reduce the associated methane gas emissions.Lauren Kramer, Beefing up seaweed production to green up beef, www.aquiaculturealliance.org, 14 October 2019 Australis Aquaculture is a longtime partner of the seafood sustainable program Ocean Wise.In search of \\"the better fish\\": Barramundi, Aquablog.ca, 5 November 2019 ReferencesFurther reading *Paul Greenberg Four Fish (2010) Penguin Books, hardcover: , 2011 paperback: External links *The Better Fish Category:2004 establishments in Massachusetts Category:American companies established in 2004 Category:Aquaculture in the United States Category:Companies based in Franklin County, Massachusetts Category:Seafood companies of the United States ","title":"Australis Aquaculture"},{"id":"49219295","text":"Sewri Flamingo Point, Bombay, India Sewri Flamingo Point Bombay, is a place near Sewri locality in Maharashtra state of India.

The game was developed in multiple parts, of which the first was released on January 15, 2016. The second part was released as a free update on September 24, 2016. The third and final part was released as a free update on September 27, 2017. Gameplay The player acts as a structural engineer, tasked with inspecting infrastructure in and around the Scandinavian city of Stalburg. The player is equipped with only a camera, which is used to photograph structural damage, and a flashlight. Though taking photographs is optional, it affects the game's endings. Gameplay primarily consists of solving puzzles to progress through each environment, and photographing any damage or relevant documents discovered along the way. During this exploration, the player will come across potentially lethal situations (such as rockfalls or electrified water), which become increasingly more dangerous as the city's infrastructure begins to fail. Some puzzles, such as choosing to fully repair a facility, are optional and can be bypassed at the cost of missed photo opportunities. To complete the game, the player must solve many mechanical and electrical puzzles and make choices to either save one's life or save the city. Plot Infra is set in the fictional city of Stalburg, somewhere in the vicinity of the Baltic Sea, which recently emerged from a corruption scandal. The player, Markku Siltanen, is a structural analyst & engineer. He is tasked with surveying the Hammer Valley Dam, and discovers that the infrastructure is in poor condition. He soon accidentally causes the water tunnels to collapse, becoming trapped underground. Along the way, he begins to discover evidence of a conspiracy between the city's business magnates, ultimately resulting in many of the infrastructure failures. Markku escapes the underground. His boss, Paul, directs him to the Pitheath Water Treatment plant, to check on water pressure levels from the collapsed tunnels. He discovers that water flow has stopped, and travels via metro tunnels back to the office. However, his journey is interrupted by more collapsing infrastructure. Due to the water tunnel blockage, a high level of pressure is put on the derelict dam, causing it to burst. By the time he returns to the city, most powerplants have failed and the city is flooded. He meets up with his coworkers, who travel to the Black Rock Nuclear Power Plant in anticipation of flood damage. They discover that the reactor is at risk of melting down. The player must quickly solve a final puzzle, either successfully shutting down the reactor and saving the city, or failing to prevent the meltdown. The game's epilogue is dependent on how many pictures were taken - both photos of structural damage, and photos of evidence relating to the conspiracy. If the player saved the reactor, but took below 50% of photographs, they will be living in a tenement with a roommate. If above 50%, they will be on vacation, and receive an offer from Paul to investigate 'Whiprock Island', a former prison. However, if the player was unable to prevent the nuclear meltdown, they will live in a rural cottage, suffering from radiation sickness - many areas of Stalburg were irradiated, resulting in thousands of deaths. Other details in the epilogue are determinant on player choices, such as optional puzzles - if the player repaired all three water treatment plants, the CEO of Stalburg Water is ousted & the city's potable water becomes safe. If the player ignored the puzzles, Stalburg is facing a water crisis, bottled water is mandatory, and 40,000 citizens become ill from contaminated water. Other details appear from optional puzzles & side characters. Development The developers were inspired to create the game after watching the 2009 documentary The Crumbling of America. The game was later Greenlit on Steam. Reception Rock, Paper, Shotgun recommended purchasing the title, and Christopher Livingston from PC Gamer stated he enjoyed the game. Engineering.com, a trade publication, called the game \\"The Civil Engineering Game We've Been Waiting For.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:2016 video games Category:Construction and management simulation games Category:Exploration video games Category:Photography simulation games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Finland Category:Video games set in the 2010s Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Steam Greenlight games Category:First-person adventure games Category:First-person video games ","title":"Infra (video game)"},{"id":"49219307","text":"Anton Holenkov (); Anton Golenkov (; born 17 December 1989) is a Ukrainian (until 2014) and Russian football midfielder.

Saul was one of several professionals working there, but telegraph boys were also recruited for part- time work. In 1889, when one of the boys was questioned at the General Post Office regarding how he obtained a sum of money in his possession, the Cleveland Street scandal broke, creating news stories around the globe. The first trial that resulted was a libel action by Lord Euston, heir to the Duke of Grafton, against Ernest Parke, editor of the North London Press. Parke had alleged Euston had been a visitor to the male brothel at the centre of the scandal. It came to court in January 1890, and Saul was called as a witness for the defence. Saul delivered his testimony in a manner described in one newspaper report as \\"brazen effrontery that reduced the court to shocked silence\\" and detailed his sexual encounter with Euston in the brothel in explicit language that shocked the court.Hyde, H. Montgomery The Cleveland Street Scandal,p146-7 He was also sharp, witty, and defiant.Aronson, Theo Prince Eddy and the Homosexual Underworld, John Murray, London, 1994, pp154-61 The line of questioning and his responses included: > \\"And were you hunted out by the police?\\" ‚Äì \\"No, they have never interfered. > They have always been kind to me.\\" > \\"Do you mean they have deliberately shut their eyes to your infamous > practices?\\" ‚Äì \\"They have had to shut their eyes to more than me.\\" In the assessment of one scholar \\"Saul refused to play the role assigned to him.\\" Unlike the messenger boys, he was a professional prostitute, and upended the hitherto simplistic narrative of one-sided exploitation of victimised youths.Coleman, Jonathan Rent: Same-Sex Prostitution in Modern Britain, 1885-1957, University of Kentucky, 2014, p59 At one point of the proceedings, a newspaper report noted that Saul \\"referred to himself as having nothing in his face but shame, and here he took out a handkerchief.\\"The West-End Scandals, Daily News (London), Thursday, January 16, 1890; Issue 13660 In his summing up, the judge asked the jury to assess whether they could possibly accept the word of a \\"loathsome object\\" against that of Lord Euston. Parke was found guilty of libel and imprisoned. However Saul's testimony is likely to have been the truth, as Euston was well known in the homosexual underworld and was later subject to repeated blackmail. Despite Saul's confession of prostitution on the witness stand, the Attorney General declined to prosecute him. The reason is unknown. Given Saul's revelations and manner as a mere witness ‚Äì which had been considered shocking enough, and the unproven rumour then circulating in high society and police circles that Prince Albert Victor had visited the brothel, it may be that the authorities were concerned over what he would have said, or whom he may have implicated, had he been placed in the position of having to defend himself. One scholar has suggested his deposition alone was so inflammatory it may have protected him.Cohen, William A. Sex Scandal: The Private Parts of Victorian Fiction, Duke University Press, 1996, p124 The Euston libel trial was Saul's last appearance in the press. He became a servant at a small family-run hotel, the Marlborough, at 23 Villiers Street in the Strand, before returning to Dublin, where in 1901 he was registered as a butler.Chandler, Glenn; The Sins Of Jack Saul, Grosvenor House Publishing, 2016, , p255-72 In the Euston trial he confessed to having been in hospital several times, and in 1904 he was admitted by his younger brother James to Our Lady's Hospice, Harold's Cross, where he died of tuberculosis aged 46. He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery in an unmarked grave.Chandler, Glenn; The Sins Of Jack Saul, Grosvenor House Publishing, 2016, , p272-3  The Sins of the Cities of the Plain  The alleged memoirs of Saul were published in an anonymously authored and clandestinely published 1881 erotic book The Sins of the Cities of the Plain or Recollections of a Mary-Ann, With Short Essays on Sodomy and Tribadism. It is more likely to be an early form of the non-fiction novel,Gunn, Drewey Wayne Gay Novels of Britain, Ireland and the Commonwealth 1881-1981: A Reader's Guide, McFarland and Company, North Carolina, 2014, pp5-7 although Saul may have contributed. In the words of one scholar: \\"Although some of the details of Sins...are exaggerated for effect, it is based upon fact.\\"Hyde, H. Montgomery The History of Pornography, p141. It has been suggested that Simeon Solomon, who knew the publisher William Lazenby, was involved. Another author who has been suggested is James Campbell Reddie,Cook (2003) p. 19.Ditmore (2006) p. 443. who had been convicted of public indecency in 1873 and disgraced.Peniston (2004) pp. 77‚Äì78. This is less likely as Reddie died several years before the book's publication, and was ill with poor eyesight prior to that. Saul's character is described as possessing \\"a fresh looking beardless face, with almost feminine features, auburn hair and sparkling blue eyes‚Ä¶and endowed by a very extraordinary development of the male appendage\\". Asked by a prospective customer to provide this name, his character replies: \\"Saul, Jack Saul, Sir, of Lisle Street, Leicester Square, and ready for a lark with a free gentleman at any time.\\"Anon: Saul, Jack The Sins of the Cities of the Plain or the Recollections of a Mary-Anne, Vol I, 1882 In the book Saul is picked up on the street by a 'Mr Chambon' who, charmed by his looks and story, pays him five pounds a week to write his memoirs. Chambon lives \\"in the Cornwall Mansions close to Baker Street Station\\". William Simpson Potter, who was a friend of William Lazenby the publisher, did live at Cornwall Residences, a now-demolished block of nondescript Victorian flats near the Station,Cornwall Mansions: The Rise and Fall of 7K and Its Neighbours, The Gissing Journal, Vol XLIV, No4, October, 2008 from about 1877 until his death in 1889. Potter was the 'compiler' of another anonymous piece of the erotica A Letter from the East (1877) as well as Letters from India during HRH the Prince of Wales' Visit in 1875/6 (1876).Cornwall Mansions: The Rise and Fall of 7K and Its Neighbours, in The Gissing Journal, Vol XLIV, No4, October, 2008 Mr Chambon could be based on Potter, who was also a friend of Henry Spencer Ashbee, and it is possible Potter may have been the connection to the real Saul. Saul's cross-dressing persona 'Evelina' appears in the 1883 sequel Letters from Laura and Eveline, Giving an Account of Their Mock-Marriage, Wedding Trip, etc. Published as an Appendix to Sins of the Cities.  Legacy  A biography of Saul, The Sins of Jack Saul by Glenn Chandler, the writer of television detective series Taggart, was published in 2016, with a revised 2nd edition issued later the same year. It revealed hitherto unknown details about Saul's life before and after Cleveland Street. A musical of the same name based on the book, written by Chandler with lyrics by Charles Miller, premiered in London in May 2016, in which Jack McCann originated the role of Jack Saul. No photograph of Saul is known to exist. However, in 2020 Glenn Chandler was contacted by a reader of his biography who owned a paper-mache head of a smiling young male which had been purchased in a Paris flea market years before. It bears a metal plate reading \\"Jack Saul 1890\\". While possibly an authentic likeness, it has also been suggested it may be a shop dummy head: an objet trouv√© repurposed. Saul has also featured prominently in a large number of academic studies, and histories, including Morris Kaplan's Who's Afraid of John Saul?, Neil McKenna's The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde and Fanny and Stella: The Young Men Who Shocked England, and three books on the Cleveland Street Scandal, including Theo Aronson's Prince Eddy and the Homosexual Underworld. Saul also partially inspired Jonathan Kemp's novel London Triptych.Kemp, Jonathan London Triptych, Myriad Editions, 2010 See: Afterforward He appears as an embittered older prostitute and narrator in the 2011 stage show Cleveland Street: The Musical by Glenn Chandler and Matt Devereaux.

The magazine was published with black and white photos, drawings and cartoons by renowned artists such as Elli Marcus or Hans Friedrich, in which arty individual photos were printed on stronger cardboard. Although the magazine was discontinued at the end of 1931, there were some new editions in the years 1935 and 1936, but the magazine was set up in a much more simple way, consisting largely of short and serial stories.Illustrierte Presse ‚Äì Kriminal-Magazin on the website: Illustrierte Magazine der Klassischen Moderne References Further reading  ‚Ä¢ R√∂ssler, Patrick (1998a): Moderne Illustrierte ‚Äì illustrierte Moderne.

Early Life  Patterson was born from James and Anna Patterson in a family of 5 children on a farm near Piqua, Ohio on November 3, 1878. As a child he attended a nearby county school, completing 9 grades before contracting pneumonia. He returned to his studies in his late teens at a school in Ada, Ohio. in 1900 he began his studies as a B.A. undergraduate at the College of Wooster. He had aspired to study medicine and as such enrolled at the University of Chicago to better prepare himself. But there he was only allowed to study zoology as they were the only courses available in the summer quarter. He was persuaded to stay on as a researcher and subsequently completed his Ph.D. in June 1908. While teaching at Buena Vista College he met his future spouse Alice Jane Tozier, a teacher in English and Latin, with whom he bought a house in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.  Career  At the University of Texas Patterson undertook his first problem, an investigation of the embryology of the Armadillo. He organised collections of fauna specimens through expeditions to the west coast of the USA as well as Central America. Through these he managed to study over 150 species. Alongside his research he also undertook the task of lecturing zoology students at the university, earning himself the nickname \\"Dr. Pat\\" through his close ties to his students and what they described as his \\"friendly\\" and \\"helpful\\" attitude. His first significant contribution was a problem proposed by Professor Charles Otis Whitman, titled 'the process of gastrulation in the pigeon's egg. Through his research he managed to prove the mechanism by which a pigeons embryo will form. He helped make many reforms to the course structure at the University of Texas, ensuring adequate training was given to undergraduates through the use of an integrated series. He also helped the university to form a department Library for Biology students. In 1928 Patterson was designated Director of Research in Zoology at the university. When Muller managed to prove that X rays prove mutations in Drosophilia, Patterson shifted his focus towards the field of genetics and speciation. Patterson used the X rays on larvae to prove that embryos mutate following irradiation. He published papers on the subject from the years of 1932 to 1935. In 1937 he was appointed Distinguished Professor of Zoology at the University of Texas and the year after he was given an honorary D.Sc. by his alma mater College of Wooster. He served as President of the American Society of Zoologists in 1939. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1941 and made the Vice President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Section F. In 1947 he received the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal for his paper on isolation mechanisms and elected Constitutional President of the International Society for the Study of Evolution. In 1952 Patterson published, with coauthor Wilson S. Stone, his greatest work, entitled Evolution in the Genus Drosophila detailing geographic isolation's role in genetics. In 1954 he was elected President of the Genetics Society of America. He was very active in his research, publishing a total of 122 papers between the years of 1907 and 1954. Mostly in embryology and generics, with a few dealing with the topics of local fauna and Indian artifacts.

It was written by Mary Murillo based upon the 1895 novel Patience Sparhawk and Her Times by Gertrude Atherton and released in October 1918 by First National. Plot As described in a film magazine, Patience Sparhawk (Petrova) is an orphan who has been reared by a dissolute stepmother. An inheritance of good character, however, has kept her from being contaminated and when she gets the opportunity to break away and become the ward of Miss Tremont, a wealthy woman, she does so. Out of gratitude she agrees to marry Tremont's nephew, Beverly Peale (Steele). Soon after the ceremony she discovers that her husband is a user of drugs and her married life is unhappy. It ends abruptly when Beverly is found dead from an overdose of drugs. Patience is accused of murder and put on trial. She is defended by noted criminal lawyer Garon Bourke (Fellowes), who is in love with her and whom Patience loves. Despite Garon's strenuous efforts, his client is convicted and sentenced to die in the electric chair. The evidence of Honora Maris (Reed), who was enamored of Beverly, was the deciding factor. The day of the scheduled execution arrives and at the eleventh hour Garon obtains a confession from Miss Maris that she committed perjury on the witness stand. Garon makes a desperate race to the prison with a reprieve and saves Patience just as she was in the electric chair and the executioner was preparing to throw the switch.

The player takes the role of a fighter jet pilot defending an English coastland against an enemy invasion, having to fight off aerial, ground and naval forces while Allied bases evacuate. The display shows the plane's instrumentation and cockpit view. The game was well-received and, despite various issues, it was lauded by critics as one of the best air combat simulators of the time and particularly praised for its accessible gameplay. The game was developed with a budget of ¬£40k by the small UK-based Cascade Games, who later produced two sequels to the game.  Narrative  The game is set on the Southern coastland of England during an enemy invasion against the remaining Allied forces. The player takes the role of a fighter plane pilot, who must defeat the invasion. To accomplish this, the player pilots one of the three available Mark 2.1 AWAT (All-Weather All-Terrain) combat aircraft and is charged with defending the last three Allied airbases being evacuated in front of the enemy's advance. Despite being the lone defender and greatly outnumbered, they must fight enemy forces on all fronts: aerial, ground and naval. The player progresses through the game engaging different contingents of the invaders. Initially, they must intercept enemy fighter planes, helicopters and landing ground forces, including tanks, land bases and SAM sites. Once the enemy is sufficiently driven back, the player can engage the naval fleet.  Gameplay  A screenshot of the game showing the player performing aerial refueling using boom and receptacle system. At the start of the game, the player is presented with a range of options that determine the experience. The game offers nine selectable levels of difficulty, including a tutorial difficulty in which the enemy forces do not fire back. Among the options, the player can choose to play either in summer or winter time and either daytime or nighttime, altering the scenery. The player must choose from the range of weapons that will be mounted on their AWAT plane. These include air-to-air, air-to-ground, air-to-sea and multipurpose missiles, depending on what enemies the player chooses to engage. In addition, the plane is equipped with a machine gun and decoy flares against hostile missiles. In-game screen shows the cockpit view split between top half for plane's front view and bottom half for plane's instrumentation. The control panel shows planes crucial data, including speed, altitude, thrust, fuel, roll/pitch indicators and a compass. The panel also features a radar that provided an overview of important nearby objects. An onboard screen displays various flight information and warning messages, and features a speech synthesizer that occasionally announces dangers, such as approaching enemies or missile attacks. Finally, a small rear-view camera allows the player to observe enemies and missiles on their tail. The game also features a two player mode, where one player flies the plane and the other aims and fires the guns. At the start of the game, the player has to take off the runway at an Allied base. Afterwards they can fly around and look for enemies to engage. The player can open their Satellite Intelligence Map, which shows a live map of the immediate coastline with items of interest, such as, friendly bases, enemy positions, and refuelling locations. The player can perform various flight manoeuvres and stunts mid-air, such are loops, rolls, or dummy stalls. Flying, especially at high altitudes, spends the plane's fuel and the player must either return to their base or perform an aerial refueling. To refuel mid-air, the player has to rendezvous with a refuelling plane at the specified coordinates and perform a boom and receptacle refuelling manoeuvre. The game ends in defeat if the player crashes, runs out of fuel, or is shot down by taking too much damage. The player can also eject, but can only do so safely over Allied territory. The player is victorious if they defeat all enemy forces. During the game, points are awarded and displayed in the control panel for destroyed enemies and on game end tallied up in a high score table.  Development and release  The game was developed by Cascade Games founded in 1983 by Guy Wilhelmy and Nigel Stevens. Wilhelmy had a pilot's license and had experience with aircraft control and responsiveness, while Stevens' father had been in British Royal Air Force. Wilhelmy explained that he wanted to create a fast-paced flying game with responsive graphics that other games of the time struggled with. Cascade hired programmer Ian Martin and graphics designer Damon Redmond to work on the project in 1985. The first version known as A.C.E.: Air Combat Emulator was released in 1985 for the Commodore 16 and VIC-20 home computers. Martin describes that an advertisement erroneously promising a Plus/4 version forced them to develop it under threat of action by Advertising Standards Agency. Martin recalls that afterwards the team had creative freedom to pursue different ideas for the planned Commodore 64 version, and after several months of development and a small delay, the C64 version called simply ACE was released in September 1985. ZX Spectrum version followed the next year. An Amstrad CPC version was announced and Cascade Games promised a quick delivery with \\"speed and smoothness exceeding previous simulators\\". Having sold over half a million copies on 8-bit machines, the game's port was announced for Amiga. ComTec was tasked with porting the game to Amstrad PCW and Amiga (for AmigaDOS). The game was marketed to America, and the C64 and Amiga versions were released and published in US by UXB in 1986. Before the release of Ace, Cascade Games was infamous for their Cassette 50 (1983) game compilation that featured simplistic and subpar games. Stevens points out that without the income from the compilation, the project would not have been possible. The developers estimate the production cost of Ace at ¬£40k. Following the release of Ace, Cascade moved into mainstream AAA game development. Wilhelmy says that Cascade boasted over a million GBP in turnover over the following years. The company produced two sequels, Ace 2 (1987) and ACE 2088 (1989), and various other games before closing down in 1990.  Reception  The first version for C16 and Plus/4 received positive reviews. Commodore Horizons awarded 8 stars to gameplay, describing it is \\"as good as anything\\" within the C16's limitations. Commodore User noted the C16 version for fast, but involved action. Their review of Plus/4 described it similarly, and called it one of the best dedicated Plus/4 games, only giving sound a lower score. Computer Gamer gave both the C16 and Plus/4 version 5 out of 5 stars and described Ace as easy to use and understand. They later noted that Plus/4 version was the best yet among the available platforms. Your Commodore criticized the Plus/4 version for poor innovation, but scored it highly on gameplay and graphics, describing them as \\"realistic\\". The expanded C64 and ZX Spectrum versions received the highest critic attention and praise on release. Zzap!64 rated Ace 90% and described it as the most exciting flight simulator on C64 to date. They noted good instruction, many available options, and easy controls. Computer and Video Games rated C64 version very positively, awarding gameplay 9/10 points calling it the new title for the best of flight simulators. They described it as very well presented with a clear layout. Commodore User lauded Ace for having found the right balance between simulation and action. Crash rated it 81%, criticizing quite sound and calling out the graphics and overall quality as average for the genre. Sinclair User awarded the game 5/5 stars and praised the game's intentionally accessible gameplay as the high point. They felt the environment graphics were not great, while important objects and effects stood out well. Your Sinclair gave the game 8/10 noting it as unrealistic for a simulator, however easy to get into and addictive. Your Computer gave Ace 4/5 points calling it a simulation that would appeal to arcade players. However, they gave the sound 1/5 points. ZX Computing review labeled it a \\"monster hit\\" and called it a quality flying experience praising good sound, excellent graphics with use of horizon line, and well-defined objects. Several reviewers regarded Ace as one of the best available flight simulators of the time. Overall, the critics agreed that the game's arcade- like gameplay was easy to get into and play, but ultimately difficult to master and challenging to finish. Reviewers also negatively remarked upon the inclusion of Lenslok copy protection system where the game would display a garbled image and the player would need to use the provided colored lens to view the two-letter code. ZX Computing and Computer Gamer reviewers had trouble getting it to work and pass. Retro Gamer called it \\"notorious Lenslok\\" in retrospect. Computer Gamer gave the Amstrad version 85%, praising the gameplay and graphics. They noted that it was an approachable flight simulator that can be played without reading the manual. Amstrad Action rated this version at 54% calling it challenging, but lacking in action. They described environmental detail and fighting as the high points, but criticized sound as poor and graphics as slow. The game was later sold at bargain prices, bundled with Ace 2 and received several retrospect reviews. Commodore User rated the C64 bargain game 8/10 comparing it more to aerial combat simulator than just a flight simulator. They noted plenty of gameplay and some simulation to keep the player occupied. Computer and Video Games awarded the game 90% for C64 and 87% for the Spectrum version praising the game and describing it as \\"essential purchase\\". Zzap!64 gave Ace 67% and felt that, while the original reviewer's opinions held true, the game did not stand up to time, with graphics being tacky and sparse and having programming issues. Commodore Force later gave the game 57% and noted that, although receiving praise during release, its lacking gameplay did not age well. On the other hand, Commodore Format gave the game 3/4 points and lauded the game even by 1991's standards. While they noted simple start, they also noted good graphics, fast-paced gameplay with superb dogfights and basic simulation. Commodore Format rated the Ace and Ace 2 bundle at 89% calling it an \\"indisputable bargain\\". They praised the fast and uncluttered gameplay with simple objectives, while remarked that the graphics were not the best. Your Commodore rated the bundle 87/100 describing the bundle as closer to arcade games rather than flight simulators, concluding that they were good games \\"with a few bugs\\".

Although it was not an official party, it was a successor to the Watani (National) party and home to several important Iraqi Cabinet and Parliament members, including Ja‚Äôfar Abu al-Timman, Hikmat Sulayman, Kamil Chadirji, and Mohammed Hadid. Perhaps more importantly, its history illustrated the often complex task of navigating reform in the ideological and socio-political climate that predominated under the monarchy. It transformed from a radical left youth organization, to a more moderate reformist group under the aforementioned senior politicians, to an unfortunate accomplice in the Bakr Sidqi coup, and finally dissolved in protest over said coup's brutality and disregard for reform. Formation and Ideas The Ahali group was formed in the 1930s during a period of expanded education and, consequentially, the proliferation of youth and student political clubs. It was formed by ‚ÄòAbd al-Fattah Ibrahim and Mohammed Hadid, both law students whom had studied abroad and adopted socialism, and though the latter came from a wealthy Mosulite family most of its ranks were from an expanding middle class of youth with no hope of participating in formal politics. Thus, although the group spoke much about political and economic reform, it initially saw this as springing from a new, more ethical and intellectual mass culture. It saw itself as a \\"school for the people,\\"Batatu, pp.301 and focused on bringing about an expansion of civil society through pushes for enhanced democratic rights and something akin to British Fabian socialism‚Äîall based in non-sectarian cooperation. Socialism and related ideologies had a negative stigma attached to them, so al-Ahali adopted the term Sha‚Äôbiya (Populism) for their at times vague intellectual orientation. In general, it emphasized equal rights regardless of social status (and democratic representational governance), welfare reform on a sort of collectivist model, and their growth from traditional institutions like family, religion, and patriotism. It condemned nationalism as imperialist. Because it could not participate directly in politics, the group initially turned its energies elsewhere‚Äîto newspapers and informal associations. Al-Ahali quickly grew to be one of the most respected papers in Iraq. However, it is important to note that despite its ostensible goal of educating Iraqis and home-growing a civil society the Ahali group was hindered by its intellectualist bent and the fact that it focused more on Western than indigenous culture. Its first paper detailed the history of Western political thought from the Greeks to Russian revolution. Members enjoyed equally astounding success organizationally. In September 1933 they formed the Association for Combatting Illiteracy and thereby converted individuals not only in Baghdad to their cause, but members from Basrah, Nasiriyyah, Kufah, Ba‚Äôqubah, and Hillah‚Äîthat is, more \\"provincial\\" locales that were notoriously hard to access. This, they accomplished with the aid and aegis of Ja‚Äôfar Abu-Timman‚Äôs assistance and blessing. Political Turn When Ahali‚Äôs Baghdad Club was disbanded by the authorities, members became increasingly convicted that they could not continue as vulnerably as before. By dropping the term \\"Sha‚Äôbiya\\" they were able to draw in politicians such as Kamil al-Chadirji whom had departed the Party of National Brotherhood either because they were too progressive, or because of disputes with the Yasin- Rashid regime, such as Hikmat Sulayman‚Äôs. Given Ja‚Äôfar Abu al-Timman‚Äôs leadership it also signified something of a successor to his dissolved Watani Party. These senior politicians formed an executive committee in March 1935, but elected to keep contacts with nonpolitical societies such as the Society to Combat Illiteracy, older politicians, and army officials through secret meetings rather than to form a political party. Inevitably, this broadening of Ahali‚Äôs horizons entailed moderation of its ideology, which became, rather hazily, \\"reform\\" broadly construed. However, Communist and Sha‚Äôbiya advocates remained active in the group. Opposition to the Yasin-Rashid administration The group grew yet more entangled in politics with the ascent of the Party of National Brotherhood and the Yasin-Rashid administration. Yasin al-Hashimi and Ali al-Rashid had established the harshest restrictions on freedom of the press and political activity of any prior cabinet under the monarchy, and Hashimi had intimated that he sought to stay in power beyond his tenure (albeit not explicitly). In April 1936 the Ahali group published one issue of a paper titled al-Bayan accusing the administration of neglecting promises for reform, and instead selling control of the Iraqi economy to the British with a railway agreement. The paper was suppressed after the first issue. The Ahali group thus issued subsequent petitions to King Ghazi through the Syrian paper al-Qabas and the Lebanese paper al-Masa. It was this that caused the group to join with the Bakr Sidqi coup and provide him much needed legitimacy through their popular appeal. This was not a premeditated move. Rather, Hikmat Sulayman had developed a close relationship with Sidqi owing to their mutual admiration of Mustafa Kemal‚Äôs reforms in Turkey, and foisted the connection upon the rest of the al-Ahali group. He acted as the sole liaison to Sidqi and the officers. The rest of the group hardly knew the general's face. As such, though the Ahali group obtained half the portfolios in government and were able to form the Association of People's Reform in 1936, they never had any power under the subsequent government. The group left government in June 1937. Shortly thereafter Bakr Sidqi suppressed their paper and the Association of People's Reform. The group's leaders and followers were scattered. Post-coup After the Rashid Ali coup, the reigning Cabinet recognized that it needed to give the opposition constitutional channels to operate in order to foster stability. The Ahali group's members thus re- constituted themselves in the form of al-Chaderchi's democratic socialists (the National Democratic Party) and the socialists led by ‚ÄòAbd al-Fattah Ibrahim in the National Union Party.

Synopsis In 1940, the Atlantic Ocean has become a strategic \\"highway\\" from the New World to Great Britain. The numerous ships that ply the Atlantic sea lanes during World War II head for nameless English ports where they unload their precious cargo of troops, war mat√©rial and supplies.

The unseen enemy that the convoys face are the U-boats that wait for any stragglers from the convoy. When an alarm is sounded that enemy U-boats are thought to be nearby, the destroyers launch high-explosive depth charges and charge ahead at full speed, reaching 37 knots, turning back the threat. Once the convoy reaches its destination in England, the Canadian destroyers quickly turn around and head back to their home ports to escort a new convoy, heading for England. Production Atlantic Patrol was part of the Canada Carries On series, produced with financial backing from the Wartime Information Board. The documentary was created as a morale boosting propaganda film during World War II.Morris, Peter. \\"Film Reference Library: Canada Carries On.\\" Canadian Film Encyclopedia.

As there were problems with combustion of the copper ore during the sea voyage to Wales or Australia, tenders were called in 1848 for the erection of a copper mine smelter. The Auckland architect Walter Robertson designed a simple building completely built of WaitematƒÅ sandstone. Opened in July 1849, it was New Zealand's first smelting house. The smelter was no longer functioning in September 1855, and shortly after that, the mine closed altogether. After the Battle of Rangiriri, which was part of the Invasion of the Waikato, the building briefly housed the 183 MƒÅori prisoners taken in that battle. Guarded by just six wardens, they escaped in September 1864 and eventually returned to the Waikato. The smelter site was purchased as a reserve in 1977. The ruins were registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (now called Heritage New Zealand) on 24 November 1983 with registration number 10. The ruins have a category I listing. As of 2015, about 50% of the walls remain standing on three sides of the building. The site can be visited by boat only.

Most sources have attributed the role of composer to Will E. Dulmage and lyricist to J. Fred Lawton, as it is credited on the sheet music cover. One source has their roles reversed, and another source claims both composed the music. The song was published by Chas E. Roat Music Co. of Battle Creek, Michigan. On the cover is a soldier with a head wound, pointing. Behind him are British, French, and American flags. It was written for both voice and piano. The song's lyrics conveys the message to listeners that they haven't done enough on their part to help the war effort. Only those who have actually fought in battle can say they have sacrificed for America. For those who are unable to fight, they are told they must give as much time and money as they can, because \\"to loaf on Uncle Sammy is a crime.\\" The chorus is as follows: :Have you had a gun up on your good right shoulder? :Have you ever slept out in the mud? :Have you performed your duties :among the rats and cooties? :Have you ever shed a drop of blood for Uncle Sammy? :Have you ever charged out there on No Man's Land? :Have you ever heard your captain call :Over the Top Till :you know how bullets sing :how they ring :how they sting :Say you haven't sacrificed at all The sheet music can be found at the Library of Congress and Pritzker Military Museum & Library.

The clay moulds are prepared in different shapes and are backed in kiln. Later these clay wares are washed with powdered vegetable matter and are rubbed with mustard oil. They are decorated with floral and geometric patterned grooves using sharp twigs. They are smoke fired with rice husks in enclosed kilns which gives its unique shiny black surface. They are again rubbed with oil and baked in kiln. The grooves on clay wares are then filled with silvery powder of Zinc and Mercury, washed with water and polished again. Lead or Tin Amalgams are also used. The silver powder gives shiny hue against black background of clay. Sometimes they are coated with lacquer when they are still hot to give them shine. The variety of household and decorative items are made including vases, plates, pots, lamps, tea-pots, bowls, vessels, incense stick holders and statues of Hindu religious figures. Surahi, a long- necked water pot, is a popular item. History The craft originated from Kutch region of Gujarat state. Some potters of the region migrated to Nizamabad during the Mughal rule of Aurangzeb. The silver patterns are inspired from Bidriware of Hyderabad which decorates pots using silver wires. Around 200 families are involved in the craft in Nizamabad and majority of their works are exported. Still their condition remains abysmal.

It was given the Geographical Indication status in 2006. Description In the 1960s, Coorg orange was grown in land of 24,000 hectare area. In recent years the cultivation area has come down to less than 2,000 hectares. Coorg orange was mainly cultivated in the districts of Kodagu, Hassan and Chikmagalur as a secondary crop in coffee plantations for more than 150 years. Coorg oranges are regarded as man-made hybrids of mandarins (Citrus reticulata). Greenish-yellow in colour, they have a tight skin and a sweet- sour taste, unlike Nagpur oranges which are known to have loose skin and sweet taste. Coorg oranges are said to have longer shelf life compared to other varieties. The hilly terrain with well-drained soil and heavy rainfall in the region of cultivation are regarded as the reasons for the unique characteristics of this variety. Coorg orange cultivation has decreased in recent years due to diseases, emergence of Nagpur orange, among other factors. The yield of each plant has come down to around 10kg which was once more than 50kg. The average production of the fruit is over 45,000 tonnes.

Homologues are present in a large number of Gram-negative and Gram- positive bacteria, with at least one member classified from archaea (TC# 2.A.42.1.7, Thermococcus barophilus). Structure Proteins of the HAAAP family possess 403-443 amino acyl residues and exhibit eleven putative or established transmembrane Œ±-helical spanners (TMSs). These proteins exhibit topological features common to the eukaryotic amino acid/auxin permease (AAAP) family (TC# 2.A.18). These proteins also exhibit limited sequence similarity with some of the AAAP family members. A phylogenetic relationship has been proposed between members of the HAAAP family and APC family since they exhibit limited sequence similarity with one another. As of early 2016, there is no crystal structural data available for members of the HAAAP family in RCSB. Members of the HAAAP Family The HAAAP family includes three well- characterized aromatic amino acid:H+ symport permeases of E. coli: a high affinity tryptophan-specific permease, Mtr (TC# 2.A.42.1.2), a low affinity tryptophan permease, TnaB (TC# 2.A.42.1.3), and a tyrosine-specific permease, TyrP (TC# 2.A.42.1.1), as well as two well-characterized hydroxy amino acid permeases, the serine permease, SdaC (TC# 2.A.42.2.1), of E. coli, and the threonine permease, TdcC (TC# 2.A.42.2.2), of E. coli. SdaC of E. coli (TC# 2.A.42.2.1) is also called DcrA, and together with a periplasmic protein DcrB (P37620), has been reported to play a role in phage DNA uptake in conjunction with an outer membrane receptor of the OMR family (TC# 1.B.14). Thus, FhuA (TC #1.B.14.1.4) transports phage T5 DNA while BtuB (TC# 1.B.14.3.1) transports phage C1 DNA (Samsonov et al., 2002). DcuB is a putative lipoprotein found only in enteric bacteria. All members of the HAAAP family can be found in the Transporter Classification Database. Transport Reaction The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by proteins of the HAAAP family is: Amino acid (out) + nH+ (out) ‚Üí Amino acid (in) + nH+ (in).

It had a range of six octaves, and its tone was similar to that of the harmonium. After its invention around 1800, several modifications were made, including the aeolsklavier, aeolomelodicon or choraleon, and aeolopantalon, but all versions had largely disappeared by mid- century. History There is some controversy as to its original inventor; most authorities attribute it to Jean Tobi√© Eschenbach of Hamburg, who is said to have first made it in 1800. Various improvements were subsequently made by other musicians, among whom may be named Schmidt of Pressburg, of Schweinfurt, Sebastian M√ºller (1826), and of Suhl (1833). This instrument was entirely superseded by the harmonium. Related instruments=Aeolsklavier= A modification of the aeolodion was the aeolsklavier, invented about 1825 by Karl Friedrich Emanuel Schortmann of Buttelst√§dt, in which the reeds or springs that produced the sound were made of very thin wood instead of metal. For this reason, the quality of tone was made softer and sweeter. It was equipped with a keyboard and with a pedalSachs, Curt (1913).

The instrument was unsuccessfulKvifte, Tellef (1988/2007). Instruments and the Electronic Age, p.38. . and appears to have been soon forgotten. =Aeolomelodicon (Choraleon)= A further modification was the aeolomelodicon or choraleon, constructed by Fidelis Brunner at Warsaw, about the year 1825, from the design of Professor J. F. Hoffmann in that city. It differed from the √¶olodion in the fact that brass tubes were affixed to the reeds, much as in the reed-stops of an organ. The instrument was of great power, and was probably intended as a substitute for the organ in small churches, especially in the accompaniment of chorals, whence its second name choraleon. It has taken no permanent place in musical history. =Aeolopantalon= In the aeolopantalon, invented about the year 1830, by Joz√© Dlugosz of Warsaw, the √¶olomelodicon was combined with a piano, so arranged that the player could make use of either instrument separately or both together. A somewhat similar plan has been occasionally tried with the piano and harmonium, but without great success. It is chiefly remembered because Fr√©d√©ric Chopin played this instrument at various recitals.

CHOA formed in 1998 when Egleston Children's Health Care System and Scottish Rite Medical Center came together becoming one of the largest pediatric systems in the United States. In 2006 CHOA assumed responsibility for the management of services at Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital growing the system to three hospitals. Today the growing pediatric healthcare system consist of the following: *Three Hospitals: Egleston Children's Hospital, Scottish Rite Children's Hospital and Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital *Current hospital under construction: CHOA Arthur M. Blank Hospital *27 neighborhood locations throughout metro Atlanta * Six Urgent Care Centers and facilities that offer primary care, sports medicine, rehabilitation and surgical services *Marcus Autism Center  History  During the 1990s the United States healthcare industry changed dramatically. Hospitals throughout the county faced colliding pressures, such as reimbursement issues, insurance coverage changes and staff shortages. Egleston Children's Health Care System, which included the Henrietta Egleston Hospital for Children and Scottish Rite Medical Center were among the hospitals that had struggled to continue providing care for sick and injured children and their families. Both hospitals were faced with the possibility of closure, Atlanta leaders urged Egleston and Scottish Rite to unite to preserve pediatric healthcare for the region. Then in 1998, the two hospitals merged to form Children‚Äôs Healthcare of Atlanta. The new organization improved its standing immediately by eliminating redundancies and reducing costs. Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Children‚Äôs went on to achieve even greater financial improvements, reaching $38 million in savings in just 24 months‚Äîwhen the original goal had been $30 million over a five-year period. In addition to exceeding the organization's original financial targets, Children‚Äôs achieved new benchmarks for customer service and employee satisfaction. In 2006, they merged with Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital;Children's Hospital of Atlanta: \\"Our History\\" retrieved February 5, 2017 the transaction was facilitated by a $20 million donation from philanthropist Diana Blank.Atlanta Business Journals: \\"A longtime anonymous donor reveals her identity\\" by Maria Saporta Sep 18, 2015 During the year of 2006, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta launched a comprehensive, five-year campaign to raise funds for the largest proposed healthcare facility expansion and renovation project in the State of Georgia‚Äôs history. Called the One to Grow On Campaign, the campaign raised a total of $294 million which surpassed the original goal of $265 million. The campaigns success was in part due to the generous support of the Atlanta area community.

It got the Geographical Indication tag in 2015. Bangalore rose onions at a market stand History Bangalore rose onions are grown in the districts of Bangalore Urban, Bangalore Rural, Chikkaballapur and Kolar. They were also grown in Tumkur, Hassan, Davanagere, Dharwad and Bagalkot. Rose onions are not cultivated in any other place in India. Appearance and use The onions of this variety have bulbs with flat base and are spherical. The other characteristics which make them unique are their deep scarlet red colour, anthocyanin, phenols and high pungency. They are also known to contain higher levels of protein, phosphorus, iron and carotene. The ideal conditions for growing rose onion are: soil with pH between 6.5 and 7, atmospheric humidity of 70 to 75% and average temperature of 25 ¬∞C to 30 ¬∞C. As these conditions are found around the Bangalore region, the variety is grown exclusively there. The pungent property of these onions make them suitable to be used in pickles. Export Bangalore rose onions are rarely used in India, but exported in large quantities to other countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Bahrain, UAE, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. During the financial year of 2010‚Äì11, over 22,000 tonnes of Bangalore rose onion were exported to other countries. This was lower compared to more than 36,000 and 32,000 tonnes exported in 2003‚Äì04 and 2005‚Äì06 respectively. More than 500 crore worth of rose onion was exported in five years after an AEZ (Agri Export Zone) was set up for the crop in Karnataka. Geographical Indication Bangalore rose onion was granted the Geographical Indication status in 2015. This allowed the Bangalore Rose Onion Growers' Association headquartered in Chikkaballapur to get patent rights to cultivation of the variety.

Early life Mary Teresa Conway was born on 29 May 1925 in Ballivor, Co. Meath, Ireland, the eldest of eight children. She used the Irish form of her name, M√°ire Treasa N√≠ Chonmhidhe, while attending convent school, where she showed talents for mathematics, science and music, and at University College Dublin where she studied physics. She earned BSc and MSc degrees, in 1945 and 1946, respectively. Astronomer Mary Conway was a postgraduate at the University of Edinburgh, in Scotland, where she carried out research in solar astrophysics, culminating in the award of a PhD in 1950. Her doctoral supervisor was Mervyn Ellison, then a principal scientific officer at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. Conway returned to Dublin to work at the Dunsink Observatory. The observatory had reopened as a research institute in 1947 when it was transferred to the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, and the German-born astronomer Hermann Br√ºck (1905‚Äì2000) had been appointed as the new Director. Conway and Hermann Br√ºck, a widower with two children, married in 1951, after which she took the name Mary Br√ºck. She had three additional children with him. Hermann Br√ºck was appointed Astronomer Royal for Scotland in 1957 and the family moved to Edinburgh. Mary Br√ºck was appointed a part-time lecturer at the University of Edinburgh in 1962. She subsequently became a full-time lecturer and was promoted to a senior lecturer. Mary Br√ºck carried out research into stars, the interstellar medium and the Magellanic Clouds. Some of this made use of photographic observations from the United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope at Siding Spring in Australia. She used the numbers, brightnesses and colours of stars in the Magellanic Clouds to study the structure and evolution of these nearby galaxies. She published widely in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, the Publications of the Royal Observatory Edinburgh, Nature and Astronomy and Astrophysics.Search for Br√ºck as an author in the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System at http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abstract_service.html.

Historian of science Mary Br√ºck collaborated with her husband on a biography of the 19th-century Astronomer Royal for Scotland, Charles Piazzi Smyth. She developed a reputation as an historian of science, specialising in the work of women in astronomy, and the history of astronomy in Scotland and Ireland. She published articles in several different journals, including the Irish Astronomical Journal, the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, the Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage and the Antiquarian Astronomer. She sat on the editorial board of the Antiquarian Astronomer. Mary Br√ºck wrote a book on Agnes Mary Clerke, the prominent 19th-century Irish woman astronomer, author and commentator on science, Agnes Mary Clerke and the Rise of Astrophysics. This was followed by Women in Early British and Irish Astronomy: Stars and Satellites, which described the work of women astronomers, many of whom had been overlooked previously.

Sleet was reported in Okinawa for the first time on record, and many other regions saw their coldest temperatures in decades. Snowfall and frigid weather stranded thousands of people across four countries. At least 85 people in Taiwan died from hypothermia and cardiac arrest following a sudden drop in temperature during the weekend of January 22‚Äì24. The cold claimed a further fourteen lives in Thailand, and snowstorms resulted in six deaths across Japan. This event was driven by a fast Arctic warming that occurred within the troposphere, forcing the Arctic Oscillation to change phase rapidly from positive (in late December) to negative (in late January), facilitating the atmospheric blocking and associated Siberian high buildup.Wang, S.-Y.

Hong Kong On 24 January, the temperature at the Hong Kong Observatory fell to ,The Weather of January 2016 the coldest in 59 years. Hundreds of people hiked up Tai Mo Shan for sightseeing, where temperatures fell to a record low of . Many were also on Tai Mo Shan participating in a 100 km marathon. 129 required rescue and 67 were hospitalised for signs of hypothermia. The Fire Services Department (FSD) deployed 53 fire appliances, 39 ambulances and more than 300 personnel. The Government Flying Service evacuated eight patients by helicopter from Tai Mo Shan and Sunset Peak to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital and the airport. The FSD also responded to 130 calls at Kowloon Peak. In addition, the Civil Aid Service and Hong Kong Police Force were mobilised. Classes were cancelled for more than 510,000 students of kindergartens, primary schools, and the English Schools Foundation on 25 January. The closure was suggested by the Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union and it is believed to have been the first time the Education Bureau has ever cancelled classes due to cold weather. In the face of some criticism the government noted that most schools do not have heat. The vice chairman of the Aided Primary School Heads' Association stated that the decision was justified as slippery roads could endanger school buses, which in Hong Kong are not fitted with winter tyres. Japan Snowstorms across Japan killed six people and injured 100 others. More than 600 flights were disrupted across the nation. Okinawa observed sleet for the first time since reliable records began. Amami ≈åshima saw snow for the first time in 115 years. Record snowfall blanketed portions of the mainland, with Nagasaki observing . On Honshu, the main island of Japan, of snow was recorded at Kitahiroshima, Hiroshima and at Suzu, Ishikawa. Temperatures in Tokyo fell to , the lowest recorded since 1984.

Mainland China Snow and sleet were reported in parts of Guangzhou, the first time these had been observed since 1967 and 1956 respectively. Snow also fell on Shenzhen, a rare occurrence for the region. At least four people died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a heating system in Guangzhou. Farther north, the minimum temperature in Shanghai fell to , with light snow falling on the morning of 23 January. Twenty-four weather stations observed all-time record lows. Temperatures across Inner Mongolia fell to a record low of . Korean Peninsula Snow and cold weather forced the cancellation of 1,200 flights on Jejudo, off the southwestern tip of the Korean Peninsula, stranding approximately 90,300 passengers. Ulleungdo was blanketed with of snow. Temperatures in Seoul fell to , the lowest in 15 years.

Yangmingshan, the Matsu Islands, and Kinmen all observed their coldest temperatures on record at , , and , respectively. Due to the subtropical climate, many homes do not have central heating or insulation, and residents struggled to cope with the temperatures. Overall, at least 85 people died from hypothermia and cardiac arrest in Taiwan, including 66 people in Taipei and Taoyuan, and another 16 in Kaohsiung. The majority of victims died in their homes. The Ministry of Health subsequently claimed only three people died and 45 were admitted to hospital emergency wards,In Su'ao, Yilan measured , Touwu, Taoyuan measured , and Hsinchu City measured . Snow accumulated to on Jade Mountain. The cold weather caused severe damage to crops, with losses exceeding NT$20 million (US$600,000) in Miaoli County alone. President Ma Ying-jeou declared the crop damage a national concern. South and Southeast Asia Temperatures in Bangkok, Thailand fell to , and down to in Chai Nat Province. 14 people across Thailand died, many of whom were reportedly suffering from chronic or respiratory diseases. In Hanoi, Vietnam, the lowest temperature recorded was , the coldest temperature measured in the city in over 20 years. Snow fell across the mountains of L√†o Cai Province in Northern Vietnam. In Laos, temperatures in Houaphanh Province dropped to and some upland areas experienced frost, causing the death of several buffaloes in Xam Neua District. In the Batanes islands of the Philippines, temperatures dropped below 10 ¬∞C, a record low for the Philippines at sea level. In the mountainous city of Baguio, where tourists typically flock because of the cooler weather, temperatures dropped to 9 ¬∞C (48 ¬∞F), the city¬¥s coldest recorded temperature in 2016.

Located just south of United States Route 302 and east of Pine Street, it consists of a multibay service building and the remains of a railroad turntable which provide access to the service bays. Built in 1887-88, it is a reminder of the historic importance of the railroad in the local economy. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. Description and history The Bartlett Roundhouse stands on the west side of Bartlett village, a short way east of the crossing of United States Route 302 and the railroad tracks of the Maine Central Railroad. It is a tall single-story wood-frame structure, in an arched configuration with four service bay entrances on the east side. Its exterior is finished in wooden clapboards and it is covered by a flat roof. The area in front of the service bays contains the foundational remnants of a railroad turntable. The roundhouse was built in 1887-88 by the Portland and Ogdensburg Railway, as a service point for extra steam locomotives needed to power trains up the steep grades of Crawford Notch. The Portland and Ogdensburg was acquired by lease in 1888 by the Maine Central Railroad. The facility was used by the Maine Central, and was taken out of service after regular passenger service was ended on the line in 1958. Two bays were lengthened in 1913 to accommodate larger engines, and two other bays were demolished about 1950, as usage of the facility declined. It was then sold to the state, which used it as a sand and storage shed until the 1980s. It is now undergoing restoration by a local non- profit organization.

The idea behind the bomb was rejected by most scientists, but during the Cold War, American intelligence managed to trick the Soviet Union into conducting research on this topic, which resulted in several years of wasted labor by one of the Soviet nuclear weapon research bureaus. Origins Mesons (hadronic subatomic particles composed of one quark and one antiquark, bound together by the strong interaction) were proposed to form a nuclear weapon as early as the 1940s. Early speculation suggested that the resulting bomb would be the most powerful nuclear weapon yet to have been developed. American physicist Ernest Lawrence used the potential military applications of mesons to obtain funding for its synchrocyclotron built between 1940 and 1946 at the University of California, Berkeley. Soon, however, the scientific consensus was that construction of such a bomb would be impossible; and in 1968 physicist M. Stanley Livingston wrote that \\"no responsible scientists would attempt to justify support in this field with predictions of an 'anti-matter engine,' or a super 'meson bomb,' or a 'hyper-drive' for spaceships.\\" Soviet research In the 1960s, however, the Soviet Union became convinced that the United States had already developed the meson bomb, and devoted considerable resources to developing its own. In 1994, Russian physicist and chief constructor of nuclear weapons bureau KB-11 (Design Bureau No. 11, set up in 1946) Arkadiy Brish stated that their work on the meson bomb was prompted by intelligence. Even though physicists Yuliy Borisovich Khariton and Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich agreed that the reports were nonsensical, the directors of the Soviet atomic bomb project decided to pursue this line of research, which resulted in several years of fruitless labor. Brish attributed this to American disinformation.

Unraced as a juvenile, he finished third on his debut in 2011 and then went on a five race winning streak, culminating in a victory in the Grade II National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame Stakes. After winning one minor race as a four-year-old he emerged as a top-class turf performer in 2013 when his wins included the United Nations Stakes and the Sword Dancer Invitational Stakes. His only win of consequence in 2014 came in the Lure Stakes but he returned to his best as a seven-year-old in 2015 winning the Fort Marcy Handicap, a second United Nations Stakes and the Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Invitational Stakes. Apart from his victories he finished second in the Arlington Million and third in the Breeders' Cup Turf. His performances earned him the title of American Champion Male Turf Horse for 2015. Background Big Blue Kitten is a bay horse bred and owned by Kenneth and Sarah Ramsey. He was sired by the Ramsey stallion Kitten's Joy the U.S. Champion Male Turf Horse of 2004. His dam, Spent Gold made no impact on the track, failing to win in three races as a two-year-old in 1999. She was a granddaughter of Mystical Mood who won the Schuylerville Stakes and produced the Citation Handicap winner Fair Judgment. The Ramseys sent their horse into training with Chad Brown. Although Big Blue Kitten is an entire male horse he is officially described as a ridgling, as he has an undescended testicle. The \\"Big Blue\\" part of his name is a reference to the sports teams of the University of Kentucky, Ken Ramsey's alma mater. Racing career=2011: three-year-old season= Big Blue Kitten began his racing career by finishing third in a maiden race at Gulfstream Park on February 21 and then opened his winning account in a similar event over nine furlongs at the same track on 20 March. He went on to win a minor turf race at Keeneland in April, and gained further successes at Belmont Park in May and July to take his winning run to four. On August 12 at Saratoga Race Course, Big Blue Kitten was stepped up in class for Grade II National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame Stakes and started second favorite in a seven-runner field. Ridden by John Velazquez he tracked the leaders before moving up on the rail, taking the lead in the straight and winning by one and a quarter lengths from Perregaux. Commenting on the horse's successful step up in class, Ramsey said \\"We‚Äôve offered this horse for a claiming price three times and no one claimed him. No more claimers!\\" The colt was then off the course for four months before finishing third in a minor race at Gulfstream in December. =2012: four-year-old season= On his 2012 debut, Big Blue Kitten was moved up to Grade I level for the Gulfstream Park Handicap and finished third behind Get Stormy and Hollinger. In the Ben Ali Stakes at Keeneland in April he finished a distant second to the five-year-old gelding Wise Dan. He was then sent to England to contest the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. Starting a 50/1 outsider, he briefly took the lead a quarter of a mile out before fading in the final furlong to finish tenth of the eleven runners behind So You Think. On his only other start of the year he won a minor race at Gulfstream in December. =2013: five-year-old season= In 2013, Big Blue Kitten began his campaign by finishing third to Mucho Mas Macho in the Fort Lauderdale Stakes and then won minor events at Gulfstream in March and Churchill Downs in May. In June he moved to Monmouth Park where he was partnered for the first time by Joe Bravo, who became his regular jockey. He finished second to Boisterous in the Monmouth Stakes and then contested the Grade I United Nations Stakes over one mile three furlongs on 6 July. The Breeders' Cup Turf winner Little Mike started favorite, with Big Blue Kitten second choice in the betting at odds of 2.5/1 and the 2011 winner Teaks North on 7.6/1. After being restrained by Bravo in the early stages he made rapid progress on the rail in the straight, took the lead in the closing stages and won by one and a quarter lengths from Teaks North. Chad Brown described Bravo's ride as \\"one for his highlight reel\\" and added that \\"this horse will run as far as you want\\". On August 17 Big Blue Kitten was one of twelve horses to contest the Grade I Sword Dancer Invitational Stakes over one and a half miles at Saratoga. His opponents included Boisterous, Twilight Eclipse (Pan American Stakes), Stormy Lord (Connaught Cup), Al Khali (Bowling Green Handicap) and Optimizer (Kent Stakes). After racing towards the rear of the field he began to make progress on the inside but failed to obtain a clear run in the straight. Bravo switched him to the outside in the final furlong and Big Blue Kitten produced a strong late run to take the lead and won \\"readily\\" by a length from Twilight Eclipse. Brown said that he had been \\"super confident\\" before the race while Bravo commented \\"the happiest I was was turning for home. I'm looking at each rider and they're riding their horses, and I hadn't even asked the Kitten yet\\". Big Blue Kitten started odds- on favorite for the Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Invitational Stakes at Belmont Park on September 28 but in a closely contested finish he was beaten a nose into second by Little Mike. On his final appearance of the year he finished eighth behind Magician in the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa Anita Park on November 2. =2014: six-year-old season= Big Blue Kitten missed the first half of the 2014 season, making his debut in the Listed Lure Stakes at Saratoga on 12 August. Starting the 1.7/1 favorite he came from well off the pace to take the lead in the last 50 yards and won by three quarters of a length from Bio Pro. Brown was delighted with the performance, saying \\"What a great horse. I wasn't quite sure if I had him fit enough off the layoff. I told Joe if he won, it'd be terrific, but as long as he finished well we had some big plans for this horse later in the year. Lo' and behold, he got through anyway on heart\\". Later that month he finished second at Monmouth and in September he finished fourth to Main Sequence in the Joe Hirsch Turf Classic. In October he was sent to Toronto for the Canadian International Stakes in which he finished second to the British colt Hillstar. On his final start of the year he started favorite for the Red Smith Handicap in November but was beaten into second place by Dynamic Sky. =2015: seven-year-old season= Big Blue Kitten began his fifth season in the Grade III Fort Marcy Handicap at Belmont on May 2. Ridden as usual by Bravo, he started favorite in an eight-runner field and won by two and a quarter lengths from Howe Great with the Travers Stakes winner V E Day in sixth. Bravo explained his tactics by saying \\"if you just point him at horses, he'll run them down. And ever since the first time I rode, that's all I've done‚Äîpoint him at horses.\\" In the Grade I Manhattan Handicap at the same track in June, he struggled to obtain a clear run in the straight before finishing second, two and three quarter lengths behind his stable companion Slumber. Big Blue Kitten and Slumber met again in the United Nations Stakes on Monmouth on July 5, where the other contenders included Main Sequence, Twilight Eclipse and the San Luis Rey Handicap winner Ashleyluvssugar. After being restrained by Bravo as usual, he produced a strong late run to take the lead a furlong out and won the race for the second time, beating Slumber by a length and a half. Joe Bravo described the winner as \\"just like an old glass of wine, he keeps getting better with age\\". In August Big Blue Kitten was sent to Chicago to contest the Arlington Million and started 3/1 joint favorite alongside Slumber and the Stars and Stripes Stakes winner The Pizza Man. He was held up for his customary late charge but failed by a neck to catch The Pizza Man. On September 26 Big Blue Kitten made his third attempt to win the Joe Hirsch Invitational Stakes at Belmont. He started second favorite behind the Bowling Green Handicap winner Red Rifle in a field which also included Slumber and Twilight Eclipse. He was held up as usual before overtaking the pace-setter Shining Copper in the last quarter mile. He opened up a clear advantage and held off the late challenge of Slumber to win by three quarters of a length. The winning time of 2:23.9 was a new turf track record and the fastest mile and a half ever run at Belmont, beating Secretariat's 2:24.0 on dirt in the 1973 Belmont Stakes. Big Blue Kitten ended his season in the Breeders' Cup Turf at Keeneland on October 31. He proved the best of the North American horses as he finished a close third to the European challengers Found and Golden Horn. In the Eclipse Awards for 2015, Big Blue Kitten was named American Champion Male Turf Horse, taking 134 of the 261 votes to win from Golden Horn and The Pizza Man. =2016: eight-year-old season= Big Blue Kitten went winless in three starts as an eight year old. He began his sixth year of racing in the Woodford Reserve Turf Classic, finishing fifth behind Tourist (who would go on to win the Breeders' Cup Turf Mile), Slumber, World Approval, and winner Divisidero. He then ran in the Manhattan Stakes, finishing sixth. After running last in the Northern Dancer Turf Stakes, the decision was made to retire him. Big Blue Kitten retired to Calumet Farm. His 2017 fee was set at $15,000. Pedigree *Big Blue Kitten is inbred 4 √ó 4 to Roberto, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

Opened in 1937, and still in use as an elementary school, it was the first school building commissioned by the prominent Durham firm Huddleston & Hersey, whose principal, Eric Huddleston, designed many buildings for the University of New Hampshire as the first campus architect. The grounds of the school are also notable as the burial site of Obo II, considered the father of the American Cocker Spaniel breed of dog. The property was listed with statewide significance on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. Description and history The Rollinsford Grade School stands in a residential area south of Rollinsford's town center, at the junction of Locust and Willey streets. The school is a two-story structure, built with a steel frame with walls of terra-cotta tiles veneered with brick. It is Colonial Revival in style, with a particularly fine entrance surround. Modern aluminum-and-glass doors are flanked by Corinthian pilasters, and topped by a transom window and arched pediment. Its gable roof is topped by a functional cupola, a signature element of its architect, Eric Huddleston. The original main block is extended to the rear by two additions, made in 1965 and 1998. The interior retains most of its original finishes. Prior to the school's construction the property was used for agriculture. It was built in 1936 to consolidate the town's village school and two district schoolhouses into a single location. It was designed by Huddleston & Hersey of nearby Durham. It was the first major school commission of that firm, serving as a prototype for numerous schools and civic buildings in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and southwestern Maine. It was one of two structures in the town built with funding support from the Public Works Administration, a New Deal jobs program. Although it initially housed grades one through eight, it now houses grade one through six. Students in the higher grades are sent to the schools of adjacent towns. Near the rear of the grounds of the school is the grave of Obo II. It consists of a marble marker set on a granite plinth. The marker is engraved with the following inscription: \\"Obo II / A.K.C. Number 4911 / Died January 2, 1895\\".

It is a three-story brick Georgian Revival building, constructed in 1927 on the site of New Hampshire's oldest high school. It was designed by Charles Greely Loring, and served as a high school until 1956 and an elementary school until 2007. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015. Description and history The former Somersworth High School building stands in a generally residential area on a ridge overlooking downtown Somersworth, on an irregularly shaped lot bounded by Grove, Grand, Highland, and Prospect Streets. It is a three-story masonry structure, built out of brick with stone trim, and faces southeast toward Grand Street. It is roughly H-shaped, with front and rear wings joined by a wide central connector. Windows are generally set in rectangular openings with stone sills and lintels, and a stone cornice is topped by a low brick parapet, obscuring the flat roof. The front facade is fifteen bays wide, with the main entrance at its center, recessed in a square stone-faced opening. Somersworth built New Hampshire's first municipal high school, on this site in 1849. That aging structure was replaced by the present Georgian Revival structure in 1927, and was considered a state-of-the-art high school at the time. It was enlarged in 1939, adding space for vocational training and a biology laboratory. It was used as a high school until 1956, when the city built a new high school. It was then adapted for use as an elementary school, a role it served until closing in 2007.

During World War II, he commanded two panzer divisions on the Eastern Front. He later commanded the 242nd Infantry Division which was stationed in the south of France. He died from wounds received during the Battle of Toulon. Biography Born in 1892, B√§√üler joined the army of Imperial Germany in early 1914 and was commissioned a leutnant (second lieutenant) in the infantry. He participated in World War I and afterwards was among the personnel retained in the postwar Reichswehr (Imperial Defence). By 1935, he was the Chief of Operations, or 1a, of the 1st Panzer Division. Promoted to oberst (colonel), from 1938 to 1939, he commanded the 4th Panzer Regiment, which was part of the 2nd Panzer Division. Upon the outbreak of World War II, B√§√üler was serving as Chief of Staff of XI Army Corps and participated in the Invasion of Poland in this capacity. He remained on the staff of XI Corps through the Battle of France, the Invasion of Yugoslavia, and Operation Barbarossa, the latter as part of Army Group South, until February 1942. In April 1942, and now a generalmajor, he was given command of 9th Panzer Division which was then operating on the Eastern Front, around the town of Shchtschigry, to the east of Kursk. In July 1942 the division was involved in heavy fighting to secure the German northern flank around Zemlyansk, northwest of Voronezh, when B√§√üler was seriously wounded and had to leave his command on 27 July 1942. Following recuperation from his wounds, on 16 November 1942, B√§√üler took command of 14th Panzer Division which, at the time, was engaged in the Battle of Stalingrad. He led the division until 26 November 1942 at which time he was again wounded and evacuated from the city. He thus avoided capture when the Germans surrendered the city in early 1943. B√§√üler returned to active duty in July 1943 when he was appointed commander of the newly formed 242nd Infantry Division. His new command was initially based in northeastern Germany before being transferred to Liege in Belgium for training and occupation duties. In October 1943, the division, intended to be a static unit with little organic transport, was moved to the south of France and the following February, B√§√üler was promoted to generalleutnant. The day after the launch of Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of Southern France in mid-August 1944, B√§√üler and his division were ordered to hold the city of Toulon. The division resisted the french forces in the Battle of Toulon for ten days before B√§√üler, who had been critically wounded, surrendered it on 26 August 1944. Although initially made a prisoner of war, he was repatriated to Germany shortly after his capture. He died of his wounds in a hospital in Vienna on 27 November 1944.

The film is narrated by broadcaster Lorne Greene.  Synopsis  In 1943, during the Second World War, three great powers come together at the Tehran Conference to decide the state of the Allied war effort. One of the three powers that has emerged as a key player is the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, led by Joseph Stalin. The effectiveness of their Allied cooperation depends heavily on the United States and the United Kingdom having an understanding of the nature and history of their other partner, the Soviet Union. In First World War, after the October Revolution of November 1917, Communist Party leader Vladimir Lenin overthrew the last Russian Tsar, Nicholas II. The Soviet Union was subsequently officially established in December 1922. After Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin emerged as the new leader. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, with great sacrifices made by the working class and peasants, the Soviet Union was transformed into the world's second greatest industrial power. In the later 1930s, faced with the prospect of war with Germany, Stalin signed a non-aggression pact, but Soviet factories turned out armour, aircraft and ships, building up their defences. In 1941, despite their binding treaty, Nazi forces attacked the Soviet Union but were met by a fierce resistance. With sweeping gains leading them right to the capital city, Moscow, Nazi armies were stalled by an unusually harsh winter and met their first defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad. With the end of the war in sight, the ordinary Soviet citizen is now envisioning the work ahead. First, after years of destruction, will come rebuilding cities, town and industries. Next, with the prospect of a different society in the Soviet Union, a new peaceful world will also have to be rebuilt.

Korherr eventually held the rank of SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer.Deutschen Nationalbibliothek - Dr. Richard Korherr, SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer, Chef der Statistik beim SS- Reichsf√ºhrer Himmler √ºber die Ermordung der Juden Europas / Institute of Documentation in Israel. Hrsg. von T. Friedman Korherr received his doctorate in 1926 and worked for the before Hitler's rise to power. He served as chairman of the Bavarian anti-separatist Reich und Heimat Committee in 1930-33, and became member of the Catholic Bavarian People's Party. On 1 January 1934 his department was taken over by the Bavarian Statistical Office, and he was transferred there. In 1935-40 Korherr was Director of the Statistical Office of the city of W√ºrzburg. (also in) Following the invasion of Poland at the onset of World War II, on 9 December 1940 Himmler brought Korherr to Reichsf√ºhrer-SS office, to study the progress of resettlement for him. Korherr's incredible problems with the SS began only when the German advance on the Russian front had been halted, resulting in the most damning statistic often attributed to him. Korherr Report During World War II Korherr was commissioned by Heinrich Himmler to calculate the number of Jews in Europe subject to \\"special treatment\\" (Sonderbehandlung, an SS code name for mass murder) from 1937 to December 1942. Korherr completed his Korherr Report in January 1943 and handed it over to SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer Dr. Rudolf Brandt on the 23 March of that year. It was a 16-page document on the progress of the Holocaust as reflected in the dwindling numbers of Jews in Germany and German-occupied Europe. It included a seven-page supplement about the deportations in the first three months of 1943. The report was released under the title Die Endl√∂sung der Judenfrage (). Korherr calculated that the number had fallen by 4 million, of whom 1,274,166 victims were delivered to camps for 'special treatment'. The exacting number of 1,274,166 Jews appeared in the Telegram sent by SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Hermann H√∂fle on 11 January 1943 suggesting that both of them used data collected by the German Transport Authority. Himmler returned the document to its author and demanded a more innocuous word in place of the \\"Sonderbehandlung\\" to divert and obscure the crimes. Korherr replaced the phrase with \\"Durchgeschleust\\" suggesting that the quoted numbers of Jews had \\"passed through\\" the so-called Durchgangslager (transit camps). A summary of his report was delivered to Adolf Hitler by Brandt. In 1945-46 he was under so-called 'automatic arrest' as state functionary, however he did not face the Nuremberg Trials, because his Report was not revealed and he later claimed he never heard about the extermination before 1945.Ernst Klee, Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich, Frankfurt 2005, , p. 331. Later Korherr worked at the Federal Ministry of Finance in West Germany. He also lectured at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in 1959‚Äì62.

Early life and education Cardas was born in San Francisco, California. He studied at Gonzaga University and Pomona College. Career Cardas worked for General Telephone (Verizon) in the 1960s doing telephone installation, central office maintenance and transmission line design. In 1969, he left to pursue a career in racing. Over the next few years he had many inventions relating to engine design and automotive racing fuels. In 1977, Cardas returned to the phone company, managing the conversion of electo- mechanical switching telephone offices to digital switching. After the telephone company's conversion to digital, he applied his knowledge of transmission lines and metals to the world of high fidelity sound, with inventions in the areas of transmission lines, cables connectors, microphones, electronics and loudspeakers. Cardas' cable designs incorporated Litz conductors, in which each strand in a multi-strand conductor is insulated. These conductors were composed of multiple gauges (AWG) of copper wire, with each successive gauge having a 1:1.618 ratio between itself and the next. This use of the Golden Ratio in the design of an electrical conductor was granted.US Patent 4628151 Cardas' Matched Propagation patent addressed a core problem (identified at the turn of the 19th century) intrinsic to all transmission cables. It matches the signal propagation velocity of the conductor to that of the cable dielectric using a progressive layered golden ratio conductor geometry. George Cardas started Cardas Audio, a high-end audio cable manufacturer, in the 1970s in California. As of 2018 it has 16 employees and is based in Bandon, Oregon.

Description E. amplicauda has a chitinous exoskeleton, with overlapping, articulated dorsal plates, common to members of the order isopoda. This species exhibits strong sexual dimorphism. Females lack the dorsal tubercles present on the pereonites of the males. Males also have a larger pleotelson and uropods. The largest male measured 8.4 mm, the largest female 7.5 mm. E. amplicauda is morphologically similar to E. russellhansoni. It can be distinguished by the lack of tubercles on the pereonites of the latter, as well as differences in the structure of the appendix masculina. Distribution and habitat This species has been found in Marin, Sonoma, and San Mateo Counties, California. It inhabits the intertidal zone where it clings to the underside of rocks. Taxonomy E. amplicauda was first described by William Stimpson in 1857. Stimpson's type specimens for the species are likely lost. In addition, his descriptions do not allow for a definitive identification, as five morphologically similar species exist in the same region. As a result, in 2015 a neotype was designated to stabilize the taxon, as well as to preserve the original species concept. In the same paper, the type specimens for Sphaeroma octonctum Richardson, 1899 were examined. They were found to be indistinguishable from female E. amplicauda and were subsequently placed into junior synonymy with that species.

Nothing At The End Of The Lane Magazine Issue 4 The recolourisation work was completed to a tight deadline and consequently employed some shortcut techniques, including flat colour washes for certain elements such as clothing, which would not normally be employed by Humphryes. Colourisation process Most commercial colourisation processes involve the use of either masks, layers or the segmentation method. The process used by Humphryes however, is unusual in that it does not employ these methods of separating colour to produce each key frame but instead each individual frame is colourised as a single completed image. A consequence of this means that although the finished product can achieve greater realism the work is very labour-intensive, with around 7000 fully colourised key frames required to produce 20 minutes of footage. This equates to an average of 1 in every 5 frames being fully colourised as key frames for PAL video.

The Panama Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) is a piece of mine-clearing equipment used by the British Armed Forces. Design The Panama ROV consists of a Snatch Land Rover modified for remote control operation, with a large piece of mine-detection equipment mounted to the front. It was created by Defence Equipment and Support, part of the Ministry of Defence, in conjunction with PA Consulting Group as a low-cost solution to mine detection in the War in Afghanistan. Before the introduction of the Panama, an average of one person every week was killed, with five or six more being severely injured. The Panama vehicle is towed behind another vehicle ‚Äì usually a Buffalo MRAP vehicle. It can be unhitched from the towing vehicle without the crew having to expose themselves, and remotely driven to search for explosive devices. A single system consists of two Panama vehicles and a control station. They usually work as part of a Talisman team, which consists of two Buffalo Rummage and four Mastiff 'Protected Eyes' vehicles; two micro unmanned air vehicles (MUAV); two HMEEs; and two Talon UGVs. The vehicles are considerably cheaper than a bespoke solution, as they make use of the SN2A Snatch Land Rover, which was rendered obsolete due to poor armour protection. The military had approximately 200 of these vehicles awaiting disposal. The vehicle has been in use in Afghanistan since early 2011. History The project took 11 months to move from procurement decision to operational use, and cost ¬£50m in total, ¬£9m less than expected. The use of the Snatch Land Rovers awaiting disposal, rather than a new vehicle, saves an extra ¬£8m over the length of the contract. The programme was managed by the DE&S; itself ‚Äì with assistance from PA Consulting ‚Äì which is unusual for procurement in the United Kingdom. However, despite the unorthodox method, the Land Rover was accepted as a solution. Lieutenant Colonel Adrian Parker of the Royal Engineers said of the choice, \\"There is a whole generation of technicians who are trained in their maintenance. There is a supply chain for the parts, all the manuals are written and all those thousands of parts are already codified to NATO standards.

The Bhagavata is a devotional account of the Supreme Being and His incarnations. The third book of the Srimad Bhagavata covers the teachings of Rishi Maitreya to Vidura, Vishnu's Boar incarnation, the curse of Vishnu's attendants, and the teachings of Kapila Muni. This book consists of 33 chapters. The Bhagavata is authored by Veda Vyasa and the source material for this summary is the translation presented by Swami Tapasyananda.Swami Tapasyananda. Srimad Bhagavata Additional material and analysis is included.Gita Press. Srimadbhagavat MahapuranaGita Press. PadmapuranaGita Press. Narada Purana For the events leading up to this point, see Srimad Bhagavata Book 2. Chapter 1 * At the end of Book 2 of the Bhagavata, Raja Parikshit asks Suka Rishi for more information about the creation of the universe. * Suka Rishi continues his narration to Parikshit by relating the conversation between Vidura (Dhritarashtra‚Äôs Prime Minister) and Rishi Maitreya, where similar topics about the creation of the universe were discussed *Vidura‚Äôs history is given, especially the incidents where Vidura gave correct advice, but Dhritarashtra rejected it and hurt the Pandavas to favor his own children * Vidura leaves the palace and goes on a pilgrimage * Vidura meets Uddhava (Krishna's great devotee and helper) and inquires about the welfare of Krishna and His people Chapter 2 * In response to Vidura's questions about Krishna, Uddhava, who had been greatly devoted to Krishna since childhood, spoke to Vidura overcome with emotion for Krishna * Uddhava is greatly disappointed to tell of Krishna leaving His earthly form * Uddhava is also saddened that the citizens of Dwaraka, Krishna's relatives, treated Krishna as an ordinary person, and not as the Supreme Lord incarnate ** The Yadavas did not realize that the Supreme Being was living with them, and kept asking Krishna to fulfill petty tasks for them. * Uddhava reminisces about Krishna's acts and glories * Uddhava tells the first part of Krishna's story with deep love and devotion, covering Krishna's birth and His time in Gokula and Vrindavana ** Even those who were Krishna's enemies attained Krishna's Supreme State simply because they were killed by Krishna ** Krishna subdued Indra‚Äôs pride by stopping the sacrifices made to Indra. When Indra retaliated, Krishna then protected His people from Indra's anger (heavy rain and thunderstorms) by lifting Mount Govardhana with one hand to shield them. Chapter 3 * Uddhava continues his description of Krishna's acts and glories ** Krishna (as a 10-year-old boy) destroys Kamsa and the best wrestlers (all of whom were demons incarnate) ** Krishna's family life and children ** Krishna's wars, and His actions to lighten the burden of the Earth by destroying the bad rulers, who had become corrupt and selfish Chapter 4 * Uddhava describes how the Yadavas were cursed by Holy Men, and how the Yadavas destroyed themselves as a result. ** Krishna could have nullified the curse, but chose not to, as this was the best way to destroy the Yadavas. The Yadavas had become excessively strong and arrogant because of Krishna's strength, and would try to conquer and plunder the earth after Krishna left. * Uddhava could not bear separation from Krishna at the end of Krishna's time on Earth. Uddhava follows Krishna, and sees Krishna ** With a blue complexion ** In a completely peaceful form and demeanor ** Having 4 arms and a yellow cloth * Krishna gives Uddhava the Highest Knowledge about Bhagavata Dharma (supreme devotion) * Vidura asks Uddhava to give him this Knowledge, but Uddhava tells Vidura that Krishna had instructed Rishi Maitreya to teach this knowledge to Vidura ** Vidura feels blessed that Krishna remembered him before departing from Earth. * Uddhava was appointed by Krishna to continue His mission after He left * Vidura leaves Uddhava to learn the Highest Knowledge from Rishi Maitreya * Uddhava leaves for Badrikashrama, where his mind is merged into Krishna in Samadhi Chapter 5 * Vidura is Yama reborn on earth as he was cursed. * Vidura asks Rishi Maitreya about devotion to the Supreme, the creation of the universe, and Vishnu's sportive actions. * People with desires act to create happiness and remove unhappiness. However, their actions often end up having the opposite effect. * Rishi Maitreya begins to answer Vidura's questions. ** Anyone who hears/reads about Narayana's glories with devotion will be freed from sadness and suffering. * Rishi Maitreya begins to describe the creation of the Universe. ** Initially, only the Brahman (the non-dual essence) was present. Everything was dissolved in Him by His will. ** The Brahman was not able to observe this, as there was no creation for the Brahman to reflect in. This is because the seer and the seen are two different entities. (Without a mirror), the eyes cannot see themselves. By this same logic, the body and the Atman must be different. ** The Brahman, through the power of Maya (illusion that leads the Jiva, which is an aspect of Brahman to think that He is involved in the play of Nature), began the process of Creation, resulting in the primordial Universe. ** This further led to the creation of the Mahattattva (great element), from which all the categories/elements of creation came. ** Then, the elements, sense perceptions, sense organs, organs of action, I-sense, Deities, etc. were created. ** However, these elements existed in an uncombined inert state. ** All the Deities praised Mahavishnu as the one who can save beings from Samsara (the cycle of birth and Death). Chapter 6 * Rishi Maitreya continues his teachings to Vidura. * Mahavishnu enters into the categories and gives their combinations life. This resulted in the creation of the Virat Purusha (entire universe represented as one being). ** This Virat Purusha is the first incarnation of the Brahman. * The Virat Purusha has 3 powers: ** Consciousness (the divine spirit) ** Action (the Prana, or life- breath) ** The ability to enjoy actions. * Each limb (organ) of Virat has one Deity, one power, and one function. ** For example, the first part to form is the mouth. ** The Deity of the mouth is Agni. ** The power and function of the mouth are speech. * The various parts of the Virat Purusha then become the universe and its constituent worlds. ** For example, the head of the Virat Purusha is Heaven, and the feet are earth. * The Glories of the Lord are Infinite. This description of the Creation of the Universe is just an infinitesimal sample. Chapter 7 * Maya (Mahavishnu's illusive power) is the power that makes the Jiva (which is really the Infinite Atman) think it is a finite body ** This illusion is removed by devotion, dedication of actions to God, and knowledge of the Truth * Difference between the Jiva and Iswara ** Comparison of life to the dream state *** Iswara (God) is in the state of spiritual realization *** Jiva (the individual soul) is in the state of material life *** The material experiences ‚Äòexperienced‚Äô by the Jiva are no more real to the Atman than the dream state is to the waking individual ** The way to overcome this illusion is devotion of God * Vidura's questions ** How were the worlds/people created ** Why are people grouped into Varnas and Ashramas and what are each one's duties ** What are the rewards and punishments for actions Chapter 8 * Rishi Maitreya presents another story of the origin of the Bhagavata ** Sankarshna (a form of Vishnu) taught the Bhagavata to the Sages when they asked Him about this knowledge * Before creation, Mahavishnu was ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù on Shesha in the Causal Waters, with the proto-universe present in a dissolved condition latent in Him * Mahavishnu's power of Time (as per Mahavishnu's instructions) awakened Mahavishnu ** This led to the start of creation in the form of a Lotus Bud. * Brahma was created from this Lotus. * Brahma tried to see where the Lotus came from, but could not find its start. * After unsuccessfully searching outside, by searching in the Causal Waters, Brahma found its origin by inward Meditation * Brahma gets a vision of Mahavishnu resting on Shesha in the Causal Waters ** Brahma saw Mahavishnu's smile which spreads happiness and removes sadness from all Chapter 9 *Brahma praises Mahavishnu as the source and support of the entire Universe ** People do not truly know Mahavishnu ** Nothing exists besides Mahavishnu ‚Äì everything visible or invisible is just an aspect of Mahavishnu's cosmic form ** All material objects are the products of Maya ** The sense of ego and attachment should be decreased until it goes away. This can be accomplished by Devotion to Mahavishnu. ** Life is full of sufferings, which can be mitigated and even avoided by Devotion. ** All works are far better (both materially and spiritually) when offered to Mahavishnu. ** Everything (all beings, objects, states, and actions) in the world has an end *** However, offerings made to Mahavishnu will exist forever, as Mahavishnu is eternal. ** As long as people act incorrectly, they will be destroyed by Time (Death). * Mahavishnu's reply to Brahma and His blessings ** Until an individual develops Devotion to the Supreme, God cannot be realized. Once Devotion is developed, God can be (quickly) realized. ** Action without attachment does not bind an individual. ** Rajas (the middle of the 3 Gunas) is the cause of sin, as it has desire and greed *** Rajas is involved in the creation of anything ** Doing actions fully dedicated to Mahavishnu results in no accumulation of sins *** Therefore, as long as actions are dedicated to Mahavishnu, actions, work, duty, and even reasonable enjoyments do not result in the creation of sins or bondages. Actions dedicate to Mahavishnu do not trap an individual in Samsara. ** Whoever reads Brahma's praises of Mahavishnu daily will soon achieve Mahavishnu's grace. Chapter 10  * The second part of the creation of the Universe (Visarga, Brahma's creation) * The entire Universe came from the expanding Lotus-bud. ** The entire universe was there in a latent state all along, and Brahma was to bring it into a visible form. * First the 3 worlds were created ** Bhu (the Earth) ** Bhava (the atmosphere) ** Swah (Heaven) ** These 3 worlds are for beings in the cycle of Samsara. * There are 4 worlds created by Brahma above these 3 ** These are for beings on the path to gradual salvation. ** These are Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapaloka, Satyaloka. * Time, as Mahavishnu's aspect of creation, preservation, and destruction is beginningless and endless * 10 Aspects of creation ** The first six are created by Mahavishnu directly, and are the fundamental structure of the Universe *** Mahattattva ‚Äì the great element *** Ahankara ‚Äì the ego (I-sense; sense of difference between me and you) *** Tanmatras ‚Äì the subtle aspects of the 5 elements (earth, water, fire, air, space) *** Organs of knowledge (senses) (5) and action (limbs, ...) (5) *** Mind and the presiding deities over the organs *** Avidya ‚Äì Ignorance about the spiritual nature of the Atman ** The last four are created by Brahma, and form the secondary creation *** Plants *** Animals *** Humans *** Devas * Brahma is an aspect of the Supreme, given the duty of Creation Chapter 11 * The nature of Time. ** The smallest particle is termed a Paramanu. It cannot be subdivided, and all ‚Äúother things‚Äù are just combinations of it. * The subtle aspect of Time is Sri Hari's power to control the universe. ** The Time that we see is its gross aspect. ** Units of time ranging from a fraction of a second to millions of years. * Everything should be seen in terms of irreducible units. * Surya (the sun) is another form of Narayana, as a visible form of Time * There are 4 ages of Time ** In descending order of morality, Krita, Treta, Dwapara, and Kali ** The current age is Kaliyuga ** In Krita, Dharma (proper conduct and duty) is observed fully. *** Dharma decreases in each age. * At the end of each cycle, all the worlds are destroyed. They are re-created at the start of the next cycle. * The units of Time have no meaning with respect to the Supreme, as the Supreme is above any notion of finiteness. * The entire Universe is like an infinitesimal particle to Mahavishnu. Chapter 12 * Brahma created 5 types of ignorance ** Not knowing one's own True Nature as the Infinite Atman ** Association with the notion of ‚ÄòI‚Äô with respect to the body/mind/senses ** Insatiable longing for enjoyments ** Anger at any obstructions when seeking enjoyments ** Dejection at the loss of enjoyments * Brahma is disappointed after creating these sources of spiritual ignorance and material destruction. * To remedy this, Brahma creates 4 very great sages ‚Äì Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana, and Sanatakumara ** Brahma asked them to populate the worlds, but they refused as they were established in the Atman. * Creation of Rudra from Brahma's anger, when the sages did not populate the worlds. ** Rudra has a ferocious, aggressive form. ** Rudra created beings like himself. ** Rudra then performed tapas, in order to create better beings. * Brahma created more beings in order to begin the procreation of the universe * Brahma created the Vedas * Brahma created the 4 parts of Dharma ** Learning ** Charity ** Austerity ** Purity * Brahma creates the 4 Ashramas (states of life) ** Brahmacharin (student living with the Guru, not thinking of pleasures) ** Householder ** Vanaprastha (the first stage of renunciation) ** Sannyasin (complete renunciation) ** Each Ashramas has 4 sub-categories depending on how well one performs it * Knowledge has 4 ends ** Moksha (freedom from the cycle of Death) ** Dharma (duty and righteousness) ** Artha (wealth) ** Kama (pleasure) * Brahma creates language and sound * Brahma creates man and woman in order to populate the world ** The first man was Swayambhuva Manu ** The first woman was Satarupa Chapter 13 * Vidura asks Rishi Maitreya to hear more about the Manu's story ** The glories of listening to stories about Mahavishnu's devotees, as they generate devotion to Mahavishnu. * Brahma gives Manu the work of populating the Earth and protecting Dharma and the Vedas * Work is only meaningful and fruitful if Mahavishnu is pleased by it. * Manu cannot perform the work given to him by Brahma as the Earth was submerged in the Causal Waters. * Brahma thought about Mahavishnu to solve this problem, and Mahavishnu incarnated as a very small Boar that immediately grew to a huge size. * Mahavishnu (the Lord of Yajna [sacrifice]) rescued the Earth and destroyed Hiranyaksha (a very powerful demon) * The Rishis praise this Incarnation. ** Each part of the body of Mahavishnu's incarnation as a Boar has a symbolic meaning in the Vedas/Yajnas. ** It is impossible to find the end of Mahavishnu's excellences. * Those who hear or narrate with devotion the story of this incarnation of Mahavishnu quickly receive Mahavishnu's grace and blessings.

It operated in the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Red Sea, and briefly in the Mediterranean Sea. Sources Not much is known about the Sasanian navy, which never really became a major force. Information about the Sasanian navy is mostly in oriental sources, i.e. works of Arab, Persian, Chinese, and Armenian authors. There is little information in the Roman/Byzantine sources, and almost no iconographic information. Organization and role The Sasanian naval forces were established since the time of the empire's founder, Ardashir I. The main role of the Sasanian navy was to protect Sasanian economic interests, not military expeditions, as the coasts of the Persian Gulf were already under rule of Sasanians or their vassals.https://www.academia.edu/29100946/T._Daryaee_The_Sasanian_Mare_Nostrum_The_Persian_Gulf_International_journal_of_the_society_of_iranian_archaeologists_2_3_2016_40-46 According to V. A. Dmitriev, the role of the navy was to enhance the military, political, and commercial influence of the empire in the north of the Indian Ocean. The navy was mostly active in the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and the Arabian Sea. The Sasanians did not emphasize the development of their navy due to their geopolitical interests as well as the fact that their military was highly influenced by the land-based military of the Parthian Empire, and that, unlike the Achaemenids, the Sasanians failed to capture the ports of the Eastern Mediterranean. The leader of the navy allegedly bore the title of navbed. Vessels The vessels used by the Sasanian military were exclusively transport landing ships used to transport land forces, and possibly also merchant ships to transport cavalry. The dhow-type vessels were used in the Indian Ocean basin, while the Byzantine-style sailing-rowing dromons and chelandions were used in the Mediterranean, but only for the purpose of transporting troops. The Persians were able to construct large ships suited for long voyages as far as the marginal seas of the north of the Indian and west of the Pacific Oceans. Operational history There were two distinct areas of operation for the Sasanian navy: the Indian Ocean basin (against the Arabs and the Ethiopians) and the Mediterranean (against the Byzantines). Sasanian navy played an important role in Ardashir I's conquest of the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf as well as in Shapur II's Arab campaign. The peak of the navy's activities was during the reign of Khosrow I (r. 531-579), who sent a force of eight ships (kashtƒ´g) under Vahrez to conquer Yemen‚Äîeach ship could carry 100 men. Six of the ships managed to reach Yemen safely. An attempt by Khosrow I to establish a Sasanian fleet in the Black Sea via the ports of Lazica in 540s, which was able to directly threaten the heart of the Byzantine Empire, was thwarted by the defeats at Petra and Phasis in the last stage of the Lazic War. During the climactic Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 602‚Äì628, the Sasanian navy tried naval expeditions in the Mediterranean Sea‚Äîalthough not very successful, they managed to capture the island of Rhodes in 622/3 and several other islands in the eastern Aegean around the same time. Since the Sasanians did not use to have a fleet in the Mediterranean, it has been suggested that their forces were transported either by the captured Byzantine ships in the newly conquered ports (e.g. Alexandria, Antioch, and Rhodes) or by vessels built in Egyptian or Syrian shipyards especially for them. Later in that war, they were forced to rely on monoxyla of their allied Slavs in order to transport the 3,000 troops across the Bosphorus which they had promised the khagan of the Avars. The weakness of the Sasanian navy is considered a key factor in their failure to defeat the Byzantines in the last war between them. After the Muslim conquest of Persia, the Sasanian navy forces joined the Muslim armies and participated in the wars against the Byzantines and elsewhere. For example, according to the Chinese source Old Book of Tang, Guangzhou was ravaged and burned during the joint naval expedition of the Arabs and the Persians in 758.

She was one of the teachers who was shot during the teacher's protest which occurred on 25 June 1944. She was one of the founders of the women's rights group Comit√© Pro-Ciudadan√≠a. Biography Laura Zachrisson Descamps was born on 26 November 1920 in Guatemala City, Guatemala, to Julia Mar√≠a Descamps Aldana and Carlos Oscar Anselmo Zachrisson Padilla, who was at one point mayor of Guatemala City and finance minister under both president Jos√© Mar√≠a Orellana and L√°zaro Chac√≥n Gonz√°lez. She married Carlos Francisco Federico Bendfeldt J√°uregui and became a teacher. Zachrisson Descamps was one of a group of teachers who led a protest of the presidency of president Jorge Ubico on 25 June 1944. The 300 women, led by the teachers, gathered in silent protest walking the streets dressed in black with black veils. They were attacked by a cavalry squadron and fired upon with machine guns. Bendfeldt received gunshot wounds, along with Ella Alfaro de Castillo, Esperanza Barrientos, Julieta Castro de Rolz, Dolores Gallardo, Beatriz Irigoyen, Cristina Paniagua, Sally Rau, and Soledad Samayoa. Their colleague, Mar√≠a Chinchilla was killed in the gunfire. Zachrisson Descamps, leading a group of teachers from the Catholic Teacher's Association (), tried to secure a mass for Chinchilla's funeral at the Cathedral, but was denied by officials who did not want to appear politically involved. The police also denied their request for a mass having no authority to order the church to perform a mass, nor wanting to expose students to more potential violence. Bendfeldt then approached the interim president, writing a letter and going to the presidential palace, but again was denied. The following day, the teachers gathered at the cathedral and formed a funeral procession which wound its way to the cemetery and a prayer was offered up by poet, Angelina Acu√±a. Shortly after these events took place, in October 1944, Bendfeldt applied for a scholarship to attend university in New York.

Location The halt is listed in the 1904 Railway Clearing House Handbook of Stations as \\"Buckhill Colliery\\". It appears in two authoritative works, but does not appear in Jowett's railway atlas, nor can it be identified on any Ordnance Survey Map, although the colliery and its connection to the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway's \\"Northern Extension\\" is plain to see on successive OS Maps.Buckhill Colliery and connection, via National Library of Scotland{ The standard work on the line makes many mentions of the pit, its opening, closing and traffic, but no reference to a halt at, or workmen's services to the colliery. The company's 1920 Working Time Table lists the mine as a destination for mineral trains, but makes no mention of workmen's trains to or from it. Opening and closure The connection to the colliery opened with the line on 24 March 1887, but its passenger services and closure are unclear. As it was never publicly advertised standard works such as Bradshaw's Guide are silent. The pit closed in 1932 and part of the site was later used as part of RNAD Broughton Moor. Services Access to a C&WJR; WTT for any date between 1884 and 1919 could give clear evidence of the halt's location and services. History The Cleator and Workington Junction Railway (C&WJR;) was built in the late 1870s, being one of the fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century, specifically being born as a reaction to oligopolistic behaviour by the London and North Western and Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railways. It was originally intended to drive the line northwards across country to meet the Caledonian Railway and cross into Scotland by the Solway Viaduct, but an accommodation was made with the LNWR leading to the intended northern extension being greatly watered down to three lines: * a link from to which opened in 1880 * a link from Cloffocks Junction to the CKPR line which opened in March 1885, and * the \\"Northern Extension\\" on the high ground past Buckhill Colliery to Linefoot. All lines in the area were primarily aimed at mineral traffic, notably iron ore, coal and limestone, none more so than the Northern Extension, which passed through open country. Passenger services were provided calling at Great Broughton, a mile north of Buckhill Colliery, but they were so unsuccessful they petered out after a mere two months. The C&WJR; earned the local name \\"The Track of the Ironmasters\\". The founding Act of Parliament of June 1878 confirmed the company's agreement with the Furness Railway that the latter would operate the line for one third of the receipts. All C&WJR;'s lines were heavily graded. Almost all of the first three miles of the Northern Extension from Calva Junction to Buckhill was rising at 1 in 70, with gentler slopes thereafter to the extension's summit at Great Broughton This favoured loaded coal and coke trains heading for Workington. The Northern Extension became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at the Grouping of 1923. Like any business tied to one or few industries, the C&WJR; was particularly at the mercy of trade fluctuations and technological change. The Cumberland iron industry led the charge in the nineteenth century, but became less and less competitive as time passed and local ore became worked out and harder to win, taking the fortunes of the railway with it. The peak year was 1909, when the C&WJR; handled 1,644,514 tons of freight. Ominously for the line, that tonnage was down to just over 800,000 by 1922, bringing receipts of ¬£83,349, compared with passenger fares totalling ¬£6,570. The high water mark for tonnage on the C&WJR; was 1909, the high water mark for progress was 1913, with the opening of the Harrington and Lowca line for passenger traffic. A chronology of the line's affairs from 1876 to 1992 has almost no entries before 1914 which fail to include \\"opened\\" or \\"commenced\\". After 1918 the position was reversed, when the litany of step-by-step closures and withdrawals was relieved only by a control cabin and a signalbox being erected at Harrington Junction in 1919. The Northern Extension was closed north of Buckhill in 1921 and subsequently lifted. Buckhill Pit closed in 1932, but the line to its site became a remarkable survivor because the Admiralty, attracted by a remote area with rail and sea access, chose part of the site of Buckhill Colliery and the surrounding area to build a rail-served armaments depot which opened in 1938 and closed in 1992, taking the line with it. After the closure of the C&WJR; south of Workington Central in 1965 all trains past the site of the halt to the armaments depot travelled south from Siddick Junction past Calva Junction, where they reversed towards Seaton. Afterlife By 2013 the trackbed through the site of the halt was a public off-road trail.

He is best known for his contribution in the field of next-generation sequencing of DNA (that subsequently resulted in Solexa, a high-speed DNA sequencing company that he co-founded), nanopipette-based scanning ion-conductance microscopy, and super-resolution microscopy. Education Klenerman was educated at the University of Cambridge where he was an undergraduate student of Christ's College, Cambridge and received his BA degree in 1982. He earned his PhD degree in chemistry in 1986 as a postgraduate student of Churchill College, Cambridge and was supervised by Ian William Murison Smith. Career and research After his doctorate, Klenerman went to Stanford University as a Fulbright scholar to work on high-overtone chemistry, with Richard Zare. After his postdoctoral research at Stanford, he returned to United Kingdom to work in BP Research for seven years. Then, in 1994, he joined the University of Cambridge, as a faculty member of the Department of Chemistry and a fellow of Christ's College. Klenerman, along with Shankar Balasubramanian, invented a method of next-generation DNA sequencing which is commonly known today as the Solexa sequencing or Illumina dye sequencing. The method is based on the detection of fluorophore labelled nucleotides as they get incorporated in the DNA strands. This sequencing by synthesis method gained popularity, and is currently regarded as the most widely used platform to replace conventional Sanger sequencing technique, despite its comparatively low multiplexing capability of samples, as it offers several key advantages: it is automated, quick, highly accurate, capable of sequencing multiple strands simultaneously via massive parallel sequencing, and economically cheaper in case of whole genome sequencing. He is also known for exploring nanopipette-based (instead of conventional micropipette-based) scanning ion-conductance microscopy methods. His research group was successful in achieving very high resolution topographic images of live-cells, in hopping mode imaging, in precise delivery of small molecules to cell, and in studying real time detailed cell- functioning. Most recently, his group is focusing on 3D super-resolution microscopy to develop new insights on protein misfolding and neurodegenerative diseases. =Commercial activities= Klenerman and Shankar Balasubramanian commercialised their invention on the single-molecule-fluorescence based high- speed DNA sequencing and jointly founded Solexa in 1998. Later, in 2007, this company was acquired by Illumina for $600 million. In 2004, Klenerman co- founded another spin-out company, Ionscope, to supply assembled scanning ion- conductance microscopes to the research community that looks for high- resolution 3D images of live cells. As per the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, as of February 2014, Ionscope sold 35 SICM units worldwide. =Awards and honours= The major awards and honours that Klenerman received in recognition of his research work: * 2007 awarded RSC Interdisciplinary Award by the Royal Society of Chemistry. * 2008 delivered the British Biophysical Society Lecture at the University College Dublin. * 2012 elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). * 2015 elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci). * 2018 awarded the Royal Medal by the Royal Society.Royal Medal 2018 * 2019 knighted in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to science and the development of high speed DNA sequencing technology References Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Members of the University of Cambridge Department of Chemistry Category:Alumni of Christ's College, Cambridge Category:British chemists Category:Fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences Category:Fellows of Christ's College, Cambridge Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Living people Category:1959 births ","title":"David Klenerman"},{"id":"49222031","text":"Tine Urnaut (born 3 September 1988) is a Slovenian volleyball player, a member of the Slovenia men's national volleyball team.

Kallay was able to communicate to the Allies that Hungary was open to switching sides again should they make it to Hungary‚Äôs border and offer Hungary protection from German and/or Soviet occupation.‚Äù The story is told through the experiences of Tak√°cs‚Äô mother, Laura-Louise Veress and her second husband, Hungarian diplomat, Lazslo Veress. Veress played a role in the Hungarian government‚Äôs efforts to extricate Hungary from her alliance with Hitler. The title, ‚ÄúClear the Line‚Äù refers to Winston Churchill's order to keep the lines of communication open in order to receive the Hungarian surrender to the British. In Winston Churchill‚Äôs six volume book series, The Second World War, he relates his own directions from the telegram he sent concerning Hungary‚Äôs offer of surrender in September 1943. ‚ÄúMost Immediate ‚Äî Clear The Line The position of the Magyars in Hungary has been maintained over many centuries and many misfortunes and must ever be regarded as a precious European entity.

Scheiber (January 31, 1922October 8, 2014) played an influential role in the development of regional government in the United States, as the first executive director of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (1966-1991). During his leadership of the council, he led a number of cooperative regional initiatives on issues including air and water pollution, housing and cooperative purchasing; his advocacy to Congress helped support the creation of the Metro transit system in the Washington, D.C. area. The Washingtonian called him \\"the primary architect of regional planning and cooperation in Washington.\\" On his retirement in 1991, a Washington Post editorial referred to him as a \\"'consummate professional, a superb diplomat,'\\" who was \\"held in the highest regard by professional colleagues across the country.\\" He played a key role in founding the National Association of Regional Councils (NARC) and, having spent a decade before joining MWCOG as a city manager, was very active in the International City and County Management Association (ICMA). Early life Scheiber was born in New York, New York, the oldest of three children of Israel Ben Scheiber, an attorney and labor arbitrator, and Augusta Abramson Scheiber, a concert pianist. He attended New York's High School of Music & Art and attended Swarthmore College from 1941 to 1944, where he majored in political science; he was awarded a bachelor's degree in political science as part of the combined class of 1944-46. In 1944, Scheiber enlisted in the U.S. Army. As a Technical Sergeant, he flew 35 bombing missions as a radio operator and turret gunner on a B24 crew. Following his discharge he enrolled at Columbia University School of Law, receiving his L.L.B. in 1947. Scheiber married Barbara Gair Scheiber in 1948. They have four children. Career=City Management= Scheiber left the private practice of law to pursue a Masters in Public Administration at the University of Pennsylvania's Fels Institute of Government. In 1955 he became City Manager of Grove City, Pennsylvania for three years. He then moved to Rockville, Maryland where he worked as City Manager from 1958-1964. While Rockville City Manager, Scheiber served as the first president of the Maryland City Management Association, from 1960 to 1962. From 1964 to 1966, he worked as Vice President of DANAC, a real estate development company. =Regional Government= In 1966, Scheiber was hired as the first Executive Director of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (MWCOG). The organization had begun in 1957 as a rudimentary consortium of city and county leaders in Washington, D.C. and the surrounding areas of Maryland and Virginia. At the time of his hiring, Congress had just passed an amendment to the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1954, Section 701G, authorizing two-to-one matching funding for regional government councils. Over the next ten years, the number of Councils of Government, or COGs, grew from about 50 nationwide to nearly 500. Under Scheiber's leadership, the Council staff provided testimony before Congress in favor of the Air Pollution Control Act (1970) and the Safe Streets Act (1970). The fields of air pollution control and water pollution amelioration became a major area of activity for the organization, as it brought together interested parties to accomplish the cleanup of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers. Scheiber's advocacy to Congress helped to secure substantial additional Federal funding for the construction of the Metrorail mass-transit system. A Washington Post article appearing at his retirement characterized Scheiber as \\"using a low-key, behind-the-scenes approach that encouraged area officials to use COG‚Ä¶ to iron out differences and pool resources.\\" \\"He created a climate where the jurisdictions knew they had to work together,\\" according to David Robertson, the executive director of MWCOG from 2002 to 2012. Scheiber secured funding for the first national conference of COGs, held in 1967, which led to the formation of the National Association of Regional Councils (NARC). He served as the first president of NARC, and later as president of the ICMA (1982). Another initiative he undertook affected the participation of minorities in the fields of city management and regional government. In the mid-1970s, Scheiber approached the Department of Housing and Urban Development, along with Mark Keane, then executive director of the ICMA. Noting the growing number of African Americans achieving local elective offices, they persuaded HUD to allocate part of its Section 701g funding for financial support to African American students to receive graduate degrees in city administration. The program, which ran in Washington D.C., Atlanta, Dallas, Denver and San Francisco, has allowed thousands of minority students to enter the field. =Awards= Scheiber received the Winston Churchill Fellowship of the English Speaking Union in 1973. He was named a \\"Washingtonian of the Year\\" in 1974, and was selected as the outstanding local government career official in the United States and Canada in 1976 by the honorary society of Lambda Alpha. Retirement and Legacy After retiring from MWCOG, Scheiber served on the Montgomery County Ethics Commission (Chair, 2000), and chaired the transition team for Doug Duncan on Duncan's election as Executive of Montgomery County, Maryland in 1994. His efforts led to the purchase of land and the construction of a permanent home for MWCOG, co-owned with the ICMA at 777 N. Capitol Street in Washington, D.C. Each year, the National Association of Regional Councils bestows the Walter Scheiber Leadership Award on an executive director whose work has significantly affected the local, state and national level.

The farm was originally built for Countess Wedel-Jarlsberg. The farm consists of the main two-story building and an outbuilding. The main building was constructed in 1798 and lightly remodeled in 1820. The center of the building is split in a small living room with an adjacent garden room. The eastern section has one large room while the western part is divided in a kitchen and two smaller rooms. From the central living room stairs adorned with classical balusters lead to the upper floor which has a bathroom and a number of smaller rooms. The house contains an iron stove from B√¶rum Ironworks in Norway from 1820. The main building is painted white with red winged brick.

A fitness-minded individual, Lancaster continued to focus on sporting endeavours after retiring from his professional football career, training in long-distance running. He broke several world records for endurance and speed in 1954 and 1955 and narrowly missed out on competing for his country in the Olympic Games. However, his training regimen lowered his immune system enough to produce an onset of tuberculosis, which forced him into an isolation clinic, and when he resumed running again after recovery, he chose to start training others rather than focusing on his own performances. Opting to pursue a career as a trainer, Lancaster variously worked for both the great footballing rivals Manchester City and his former club, Manchester United. He notably formulated the fitness regime of Manchester City's successful team of the 1960s and 70s. While his strict training schedule was initially unpopular, it would eventually come to be recognised by their players as the chief cause of their incredible fitness, leading them to a number of trophies. Following his retirement from sports training he moved into journalism, setting up a sports news agency for which he freelanced for a variety of local and national publications, in which capacity he travelled around the world including to report on five Olympic Games.

Holder, 727 F.3d 735 (7th Cir. 2013), is a precedent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit addressing an alien's motion to reopen after the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) had denied her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and for relief under the convention against torture. Judge David F. Hamilton wrote the opinion for the three-judge panel which granted the petition for review and remanded the case to the BIA for further proceedings.  Facts  The case concerned Tatsiana Boika, a citizen of Belarus, who entered the United States legally in 2006 but subsequently overstayed her period of authorized stay. Boika was placed in removal proceedings. In proceedings, she conceded removability but applied for asylum under 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1159, for withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1231(b)(3), and for relief under the convention against torture. Boika's request for relief was based on past persecution for her political involvement in Belarus. Boika's husband made parallel claims that were derivative to her claims. The Immigration Judge hearing the case denied her application for asylum on the ground of inconsistencies in her testimony and corroborating documents. The denial was affirmed by the BIA, and the Seventh Circuit deniedBoika v. Holder, No. 10-2504 (7th Cir. June 6, 2011) courtesy of Google Scholar Boika's petition for review. Boika's moved to reopen proceedings under 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii) was based on allegations of materially changed conditions in Belarus. Specifically, she cited the Belarusian government's crackdown on political opposition and related human rights abuses following the reelection of President Alexander Lukashenko in 2010. The BIA denied Boika's motion to reopen on finding that the evidence that she presented did not represent a \\"material change of conditions\\" in Belarus and that the evidence did not show a prima facie claim for eligibility for asylum. The BIA denial devoted a single, conclusory sentence to explaining why it found that the evidence Boika submitted was insufficient to merit reopening proceedings.  Holding  In a decision by Judge David F. Hamilton, the Seventh Circuit granted Boika's appeal from the denial of her motion to reopen proceedings under 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii) and remanded the case to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with the Seventh Circuit decision. In the first point of the decision, the Seventh Circuit held that the BIA had failed to address \\"potentially meritorious evidence\\" submitted by Boika to show materially changed conditions in Belarus. The decision noted: > The Board's terse explanation said only that 'the Evidence proffered with > the respondents' present motion does not reflect the changed country > conditions in Belarus that materially affect their eligibility for asylum, > withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Quoting from its decision in Kebe v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 855, 857 (7th Cir. 2007),Kebe v. Gonzales 473 F.3d 855, 857 (7th Cir. 2007) courtesy of Google Scholar the decision stated: > We have frequently remanded cases when the BIA's or the IJ's failure to > discuss potentially meritorious arguments or evidence calls into question > whether it adequately considered these arguments. The Seventh Circuit took no position on whether the evidence that Boika submitted warranted reopening. Rather, it saw it necessary to remand the case to the BIA because the BIA \\"did not appropriately explain why it rejected her evidence of changed country conditions.\\" The BIA, in denying Boika's motion to reopen, had held that Boika had not established a prima facie case for asylum eligibility because the evidence of changed country conditions did not demonstrate that the Belarusian government was personally interested in Boika. However, the Seventh Circuit explained, the BIA's rationale was \\"not complete or correct\\" because 8 U.S.C. 1208.13(b)(2)(iii) required only that Boika show \\"a well-founded fear of persecution upon return to Belarus by showing that she belongs to a group that is currently being persecuted.\\" Accordingly, the Seventh Circuit found that the BIA had abused its discretion by requiring Boika to show that she would have been personally targeted upon returning to Belarus. Finally, the Seventh Circuit rejected the government's argument that the prior adverse credibility finding rendered the BIA's lack of explanation harmless because \\"it would have been an abuse of discretion for the Board to rely only on the prior adverse credibility finding to discredit Boika's new evidence without a proper evidentiary hearing.\\" The Seventh Circuit affirmed the principle that an applicant may be granted reopening by demonstrating changed circumstances even if there was a prior adverse credibility finding.

He was the premier bass singer at the Paris Op√©ra from 1785 to 1804 and took alternative operatic roles with another great singer, Auguste-Athanase Ch√©ron (1760-1829); afterwards he became choirmaster at the opera. In March 1822 Martin-Joseph succeeded Lain√© as professor of declamation at the √âcole royale de musique. Unfortunately, he did not live long to enjoy his new position. Martin-Joseph died November 1822. Some critics considered Martin-Joseph's voice to be too harsh. However, he was an excellent actor. Martin-Joseph's musical talents did not stop with signing. He was also a composer. There are two surviving songs which deal with the aftermath of the French Revolution and foreign invasion. The first was entitled Hymne √† la Victoire (1795) and the second hymn to the martyrs for liberty. Martin Joseph Adrien In 1813, Martin-Joseph married the Baroness Gabrielle-Constance de Philippy de Bucelly d'Estr√©es (1782-1854), daughter of Albert Philippi de Bucelly du Tronquoy, Baron d' Estr√©es (1745-1808) and Catherine Georgia (1753-1810). Martin-Joseph and Gabrielle-Constance issued two equally talented musicians: Atala Th√©r√®se Adrien (1814-1865), wife of the French composer Pierre-Fran√ßois Wartel (1806-1882) and Rosine-Charlotte Adrien, the wife of renowned music teacher Fran√ßois Alexandre Nicolas Ch√©ri Delsarte (1811-1871). The artistic legacy of the Adrien brothers continued on to the next generations. In particular, the children of Delsarte become involved in painting and sculpting and so did his grand-children. Among DelSarte's notable descendants stands out the painters Marie Magdeleine Real del Sarte,n√©e DelSarte, (1853-1927) and Th√©r√®se Geraldy (1884-1865), and the sculptor Maxime R√©al del Sarte . Family Martin-Joseph came from an artistic family. He was the son of Martin-Joseph Adrien and Marie-Th√©r√®se Cantillon. In total, he had five siblings, many of them musicians. Martin-Joseph's two other brothers Arnold-Michel Adrien dit Adrien l'Ain√© (1756-1814) and Jacques-Fran√ßois- Ferdinand Adrien (1760-1830) were also involved in the Paris musical world.

Mass was initially said in his house in Capel Terrace.History from shwos.co.uk, retrieved 24 January 2016 The main benefactor of the church was Helen Tasker (1823‚Äì1888). She resided at Middleton Hall, Brentford in Essex and was made a countess by Pope Pius IX in 1870. She was the daughter and inheritor of businessman Joseph Tasker, of the United Mexican Mining Association.The Nobilities of Europe ed. Marquis de Ruvigny, from Internet Archive (Edinburgh: Ballantyne Press, 1909), 160. =Construction= On 8 October 1868, Helen Tasker laid the foundation stone of the church. The architect was Thomas Goodman and the building firm was Wilkins & Son from Chatham. Goodman designed the church to be in the Gothic Revival style with inspiration from E. W. Pugin. The carvings in the church were done by Thomas Earp. Construction of the church cost ¬£1,700. In October 1869, after the nave, chancel and sacristy were completed, the church was opened by the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Manning. As the remainder of the church had not been built, temporary screens were erected to block the view of the rest of the construction being undertaken. In 1887, a presbytery was built, the architect was Leonard Stokes. Stokes went on to design a wing of the neighbouring convent, which later became St Bernard's High School. Benedict Williamson also designed an extension on to that convent.Westcliff-on-Sea - Our Lady Help of Christians and St Helen from English Heritage, retrieved 24 January 2016 In 1895, a new high altar was installed.

The architect for these extensions was Alexander Scoles. On 12 August 1919, the church was consecrated by the first Bishop of Brentwood, Bernard Ward.

After successfully exhibiting her work, Schradi began travelling throughout Germany to conduct workshops and readings. These workshops are designed to inform people on how to use her comics to fight prejudice. __TOC__  Career  After completing her Psychology diploma in Erlangen and Amsterdam, Schradi practiced as a psychologist for several years. In addition, she completed degrees in Communication Design and Media Author in Nuremberg and Stuttgart. Eventually, she returned to sketching comics, a childhood passion, spending several years self-publishing them. Some of her comics have been released as the book Oh, I see?! (Ach, so ist das?! in the original German title) with the publishing company Zwerchfell. = Oh, I see?! = Schradi noted discussions in the province of Baden-Wuerttemberg on the implementation of LGBT*I themes in the school curriculum as catalyst for Oh, I see?!. The comics are a collection of true stories about people ages 20‚Äì68 in the LGBT*I community. Different themes are found throughout the comics including coming out stories, anonymity at work and experiences on how peers at school view homosexuality. A book was first published in 2014, but many of the comics can also be found on the official website for Oh, I see?!, available in German, English, Spanish and Russian. A Chinese translation is in preparation Beyond being a collection of people's lives, it is an anti- discrimination project supported by the Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth in a project titled Toleranz f√∂rdern ‚Äì Kompetenz st√§rken(Promoting tolerance-strengthening competence), the Human Rights Office of the City of Nuremberg, and the Hannchen-Mehrzweck-Stiftung. More details on this project are given in a chapter which Schradi co-authored in the book Teaching Gender. = Pedagogy in Germany = After discussions in Baden-Wuerttemberg concerning the inclusion of LGBT*I themes in the school curriculum were met with backlash, Schradi began collecting stories from people and sketched them. Studies demonstrating how many people are still too afraid to out themselves at work also inspired her to do her work. In addition to this, many teachers still do not react to homophobic behavior in the classroom. The success of the comics gave her opportunities to be involved in how LGBT*I themes can be incorporated in the classroom. Beyond her work as a cartoonist, Schradi has been published, alongside Christine Burmann, in a chapter of Teaching Gender? titled Ach, so ist das?! Ein Antidiskriminierungsprojekt zu LSBTI* auch fuer die Schule (Oh, I see?! An anti-discrimination project about LSBTI* even for school). There they discuss how comics can offer insight into the life of the LGBT*I community on a textual and visual level. More specifically, how these comics can inform people at workshops as well as further educate teachers for their curriculum. The work's relevance is cited in the prevalence of homophobia in modern-day Germany. An online questionnaire showed that almost half of the participants had been discriminated against in the previous year, and a third were closeted at their school. Until 2015, she was in charge of the blog Infothek Lehre, which is funded by the German ministry of education and research. It is a platform dedicated to informing teachers, and professors about current publications in the field of teaching. Schradi herself conducted interviews with people in the German education system from different fields where their ideas, methodologies, and goals were discussed.  Activism  Schradi has made it her mission to expose people to the daily lives and trials of people in the LGBT*I community. This mission has been realized after her work was successfully exhibited in Nuremberg. Since then, she has introduced her work throughout Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Finland, Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine. A funding by the ministry of family has helped the team around Christine Burmann and Martina Schradi develop methodologies showing how teachers can discuss LGBT*I themes in their classrooms. In 2015, she had the opportunity to introduce her work at notable events such as the Proud At Work (PAW) conference. Ways in which comics, such as Oh, I see?!, may be used as teaching material are discussed in workshops. Oh, I see?! is already being used at the Friedrich-Alexander University in conventions and workshops for the further education of teachers. Schradi also worked as federal manager for Lambda e.V. an organization that acts on behalf of LGBT*I youth in the political and public spectrum. It also offers youth an opportunity to discuss their feelings in a non-judgmental environment, where they can be themselves.

Until 2011 she worked as an artist under her given name Gabriele-Maria Scheda. She lives and works in Berlin and in New York City, United States  Personal life  Jonny Star spent her first ten years in D√ºsseldorf and the surrounding area before moving to the Hochsauerland region (North Rhine- Westphalia) with her parents and two sisters. There her parents opened an alternative hotel which became the vacation destination of the D√ºsseldorf art and theater scene in the 1970s. Jonny Star's mother belonged to the scene as part of the circle of the American theatre director and theatre manager Ernest Martin from the late 1960s on. In 1982 Jonny Star left her home and became part of the West Berlin subculture. In 1990 she passed her A-levels in an all women's class at the School for Adult Education (Schule f√ºr Erwachsenenbildung) in Berlin and studied Psychology at the TU Berlin from 1991 until 1996. From 1985 to 1992, Jonny Star co-operated the legendary cult bar Caf√© Anfall in Berlin-Kreuzberg and had extended stays abroad in France, Spain, Portugal, the US, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Morocco, Algeria, Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger before starting to work professionally as a visual artist in 1996. From 1997 to 1999, she learned Mold making and the process of bronze casting in the prestigious Berlin based fine art foundry Bildgie√üerei Hermann Noack. In the years 1999 to 2005, followed numerous stays in Portugal. In addition to her artistic work, she initiated and curated international exhibitions and art projects like Showroom Berlin (1996‚Äì1998), JONNY'S (2007‚Äì2009), SWEET HOME (2011‚Äì2012) and SUPERUSCHI (since 2013). Since 1996 Jonny Star has exhibited internationally.  Artistic work  In her artistic work, Jonny Star uses various materials and media which she often combines, such as bronze, photography, fabric and installation elements. Star usually creates series of works that develop over several years in parallel. In early bronze sculptures like the series Dear Germaine (1998) or and suddenly (1998‚Äì99) she creates humanlike imaginary creatures that deal with the counterpoints of heaviness and lightness, movement and stagnation and with themes like imprisonment, exposure or suffering. In the bronzes of the series alle zusammen (2001), suchen eine reise (2003), and wachen sein tot (2009‚Äì10) the artist additionally uses found objects from nature. In some work series, such as JETZT KOMM ICH (2007) or in the soft objects, cushion-like objects for the wall like My Flowerself (2010), Jonny is Back (2011) or komm ruh' dich aus (2012), Jonny Star deals with her own biography embedded in a private everyday aesthetics. With the change of her name from Gabriele-Maria Scheda to Jonny Star in 2011, occur more frequently topics like sexuality, physicality, identity, gender roles and their social reception. In Sex Sells (2013),Interview by Virginia Villari, Creaminology, New York, 2013 , Toy Girls (2014), Toy Boys (2014) or Free Your Soul (2015) Star accesses heterosexual and homosexual Internet pornography. She transfers video stills that she photographs from the screen or photos from pornographic magazines on fabric and collages them on doilies, or on self-made fabric objects and tapestries to reveal discriminatory gender clich√©s or sexual taboos that exist in our society. Many of her works of art criticize the structures of the global art market that should be  Curated exhibition series  Jonny Star develops group exhibitions in private homes, such as her own, or in gallery and project spaces, where Star creates spatial interventions to imitate the intimacy of private spaces. Star's main interest is to form of a participatory community of artists and visitors of the exhibition, as well as creating a greater awareness of the necessity of art in everyday life. She sees herself not necessarily as a curator, but rather as someone who brings The exhibitions are not profit-oriented and were supported by the Berlin Senate Chancellery for Cultural Affairs among others or financed through crowdfunding campaigns. = Jonny's (2007‚Äì2009) = Ostensibly, Jonny Star's arts project Jonny'slink to Jonny's on Superuschi Website is a Portuguese shop (later with Caf√©) in a part of the artist's ground-floor apartment in Berlin-Kreuzberg. Most of the delicacies sold there were obtained directly from the manufacturers in Portugal and had an unusual, anachronistic packaging design. In fact, Jonny's was an expansive art installation, also hosting exhibitions of different artists. On the shelves, between the food and household goods, bronze sculptures, collages and paintings were shown. Life and art were considered equal here.

Out of these interests grew the New Zealand kit and replica car industry with the introduction of fibre-glass car bodies in the 1950s. Beginnings Saker GT In the early 1950s, with the advent of fibreglass bodied cars, a new opportunity arose for local companies associated with car enthusiasts to create car bodies. Among the first of these early manufacturers was Weltex Plastics Limited of Christchurch, which imported a Microplas Mistral sports car mould and began making bodies and chassis in 1956, along with Brian Jarvis. They were followed in 1957 by Frank Cantwell's Puma, the Ching, F10, and Falcon.Historic Racing Cars of New Zealand, Graham Vercoe, Reed Books, Auckland 1991, Also in New Zealand during this period, Ferris de Joux was constructing a variety of sports racers. De Joux is noted in particular for his Mini GT from the 1960s. The Everson brothers, who were noted for making New Zealand first indigenous twin engined mono-plane, between 1935 and 1937 created a small two-seater rear engined car called the Everson Cherub. Three different one-off models were made by the brothers. Ernest's son Cliff built a variety of Everson models from the 1960s to the 1980s. The most successful was his eight Cherubs that were similar in design to the Mini Moke. Ross Baker's Heron Cars started in 1962 making racing cars and eventually began producing kit cars in 1980. Bill Ashton,and Ted George in the 1960s and moulded Tiki fibreglass bodies at their firm George and Ashton Limited in Dunedin.Three were known to have been made. Graham McRae with Steve Bond of Gemini Plastics imported a replica Le Mans McLaren M6B styled GT mould in 1968, The cars were made and sold by Dave Harrod and Steve Bond of Fibreglass Developments Ltd, Bunnythorpe as the Maram. McRae went on to make a very good Porsche Spyder replica in the 1990s. A number of new companies entered the market in the 1980s - Almac 1985, Alternative Cars (1984), Cheetah (1986), Chevron (1984), Countess Mouldings (1988), Fraser (1988), Leitch (1986), and Saker (1989). Some recent ones are Beattie (automobile) (1997), which became Redline in 2001, and McGregor (2001). Two companies which specialise in making replicas of various models to order are Classic Car Developments (1992) and Tempero. Both of these companies were noted for the quality of their workmanship.

One of these has been in the United States since 2003.1955/6 Ashley 750 Cantwell Puma Sports No.1 retrieved 4 March 2016 =Cheetah Cars= Cheetah Targa Rally car Cheetah Cars is a New Zealand based kit car company that commenced in 1986 and produced a kit loosely based on the Jaguar E-Type shape. It ceased constructing cars in 1991. This car is not to be confused with John Bush of Oamaru's Cheetah Sports from the early 1960s. Gideon de Lautour suggested the idea of creating a kit car based on a picture in the 1981 January‚ÄìMarch issue of the Australian Sports Car World magazine. It was a BRG Jaguar E-Type S1 convertible that had been stripped of all chrome, had a roll bar installed, a set of lake pipes out the side and flared wheel arches and was being used for classic car racing. Gideon had extensive experience working on exotic machinery in the United Kingdom. The body style was to be based on the E-Type with Triumph 2000/2500 chassis and running gear. The HQ Holden was suggested as a better option because they were plentiful and cheap. Also, there were numerous variants from six cylinders to 350 V8s. The running gear was robust and the brakes exceptional for the period. The track was a little wider than the S1/S2 E type. Maximising the use of the donor vehicle for parts was also a key factor. Work started in 1986 in Gideon's garage with the purchase of an HQ which was stripped for parts. The rear floor pan was cut from the body and a central space-frame was constructed that connected the rear floor pan to the front sub-frame. On this was constructed a buck to be used for taking body moulds. An incomplete prototype was presented at the 1988 New Zealand Car Show in Epsom, Auckland. Some sales were generated as was a lot of skepticism. During construction of the first car fibreglass sills, doors, and windscreen surround were decided upon to reduce the workload. Tron Cars on Auckland's North Shore were given the task of mould making due to their quality work on a Lamborghini Countach replica and an RX7 based car called the Mountach. Two more vehicles were sold during this period and delivered in 1989 as rolling chassis. Also, four chassis were made for the Company Directors to test and improve the assembly manual. Three events had a negative impact on the company. The 1987 share market collapse, the changed rules in 1989 for importing second hand vehicles, and rumours about possible changes to Government regulations that could add considerable cost to building a kit car. These rumours later proved incorrect but in the interim all kit car sales plummeted. The Directors decided to close down the operation in 1990, sell the prototype and see how the market performed. The existing chassis were taken away and completed by the Directors. Before the operation closed an order was received from Australia. The kit was completed and sent to Launceston, Tasmania in November 1991. In total 9 vehicles were made. * 1 Prototype Currently being used as a NZ Targa competition vehicle * 2 Road registered, complete * 3 The current owner has installed a Nissan 3.0 straight six engine in the vehicle and to be road registered again * 4 Road registered * 5 Director‚Äôs car, Road registered, complete * 6 Director‚Äôs car, Road registered, complete * 7 Was road registered.

The first new road was built from Mengla, Yunnan Province, PRC to Phongsali, Laos; it was completed on 25 May 1963. The next major road built was Route 46, begun in the 1966 dry season and stretching from the southern tip of Yunnan Province southward toward the border of the Kingdom of Thailand. As 25,000 Chinese troops and 400 antiaircraft guns came to be posted to defend Route 46, and Thai support of American war efforts in both the Laotian Civil War and the Vietnam War became widely known, there was uneasiness among both Thai and American intelligence communities concerning Communist China's intents in constructing the all-weather highway. American interest in the new road extended up to the White House. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) trained guerrillas spied on Route 46, and there was an attempt to block it with the abortive Operation Snake Eyes. However, Chinese antiaircraft fire upon overflying aircraft and steady increases in Chinese troops guaranteed its security from attack. In turn, while there were some preemptive joint military operations during 1972 by troops of both the Royal Lao Army and the Royal Thai Army along the Lao/Thai border just south of Route 46, the road was not used to invade Thailand. The Chinese did chase the local Lao population from the Pak Beng Valley verging on the road to expedite Chinese occupation, but stopped the road at the Mekong River short of the Lao/Thai border. While there were several theories about China's intent in building Route 46, the only firm conclusion was one by an anonymous American military intelligence analyst: \\"Northern Laos has a new border.\\" Background The Kingdom of Laos gained independence from French colonial rule at the end of the First Indochina War. From its inception, Laos was troubled by a communist insurrection. The United States stepped in provide foreign aid to Laos, to aid in quelling the uprising.Castle, pp. 9-13. In March 1961, the Geneva Conference of 1954 reconvened with wider participation to reconsider the neutralization of the Kingdom of Laos. Since the 1954 Agreement was signed, a Pathet Lao insurgency had burgeoned, threatening the national sovereignty. This would eventually result in an attempt to settle the Laotian Civil War, the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos signed on 23 July 1962.Stuart-Fox, pp. 118-120. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma curried favor with the People's Republic of China by striking a road construction deal with them in January 1962. The Chinese government committed to the foreign aid commitment of building roads connecting Yunnan Province with northern Laos despite the developing Laotian Civil War.Stuart-Fox, p. 56.Conboy, Morrison, p. 313. At the time the agreement was announced, the Battle of Luang Namtha was being fought on the Lao/Chinese border.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 67l-73. Activities=Phongsali Province= The location of Meng La, China, where road construction began, is approximated by the airfield marker on the left edge of the map. The first road constructed by the Chinese was begun by 10,000 laborers in 1962, following a deteriorated route from Meng La, China to Phongsali, Laos. The 80 kilometer dirt track was completed on 25 May 1963. It was dubbed the Laotian-Chinese Friendship Highway and given to the Pathet Lao. The new road washed out in that rainy season. A repair and washout cycle followed for the next two years. The only military activity connected with this road was some training of Patriotic Neutralists officers by the Chinese army in Phongsali later, in 1965. After completion of the Friendship Highway, the Chinese did not consult the Royal Lao Government (RLG) before beginning to survey other road alignments.Castle, p. 72. At the time, the CIA was running a covert paramilitary operation from Nam Yu, Laos, somewhat southwest of this original road and near Luang Namtha. CIA sponsored Royalist guerrillas had cut the Route 32 Pathet Lao supply line between Moung Sing and Luang Namtha. The CIA thought fighting between their guerrillas and the Pathet Lao along the border may have sparked this road construction. During the dry season of the first few months of 1966, Chinese crews began constructing three more roads within Yunnan Province, but pointed towards the Laotian border. Route 411 ran southwest from Meng Mang. Route 412 stretched toward the border village of Batene. Route 4023 split from 412 with a southeasterly heading. After a rainy season break, the road crews resumed construction in late 1966, extending the three roads to the border by early 1967. Chinese porters helped restore the broken Route 32 logistics link. By late 1967, People's Liberation Army forces began making one- and two-day incursions into Laos along the border. Route 12 was now defended by 17 antiaircraft guns.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 313-314 The resident CIA case officer now sent road watch teams from Nam Yu into China to spy on the construction as the work continued into 1968. The Lao loss of the Battle of Nam Bac southeast of the construction in January seemed to spur the Chinese on in their endeavors. There were now six companies of the PLA stationed within Laos. However, on 16 June 1968, road work was halted because of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. It resumed in mid-August with the arrival of a convoy of 208 trucks. By the end of August, Route 412 had been extended to join the existing Route 31. In turn, this hooked to Route 4. By mid-October there were 1,000 combat troops guarding 2,000 construction workers on Route 4; they were equipped with ten bulldozers and a steamroller. Their expressed purpose was the upgrading of Route 4 into a six meter wide extension of their road network to Moung Sai. There it would meet both Route 45 and Route 46.Conboy, Morrison, p. 314.Anthony, Sexton, p. 239. In January 1969, the new road segment was completed to Moung Sai. The remainder of the dry season was spent by the Chinese in building a road northeastward to Moung Sai to connect with the old Route 45. By April, the rains again halted construction. Later that year, dry weather brought on a resumption of road work. The new segment to Route 45 was restarted, though at a low level of activity. The Chinese emphasis became Route 46. Meanwhile, Route 45 had been extended to Moung Khoua on the Nam Ou; a ferry dock was built to transfer traffic across the river to Route 19, which connected to Dien Ben Phu. A battery of antiaircraft guns was installed at Muang Khoua. =South toward Thailand= The terminus of Route 46 (since renumbered as Route 2) is shown in the top middle of this map. The old French Route 46 alignment south down the Pak Beng Valley to Pakbeng on the Mekong River ended just a short distance from the border with the Kingdom of Thailand. Improvement of this road threatened the security of Thailand. As the Thai Deputy Prime Minister stated, with only some exaggeration, \\"Chinese and North Vietnamese Communists...only three hours by motor vehicle drive from the border.\\" If the news that Route 46 had reached Moung Houn by early November 1969 was not sufficiently perturbing, the movement of antiaircraft guns that far south garnered attention. In December they fired upon the unarmed Douglas C-47 of General Ouane Rattikone proving that the Chinese would ward off intrusions. The Royal Lao Government began to worry also, and King Sisavang Vatthana urged Souvanna Phouma to take military action against the construction. In mid-December, U.S. Ambassador G. McMurtrie Godley cabled for approval to take military action in the next dry season. Approval was promptly refused. However, despite Washington's refusal, Royalist guerrillas were already spying on the construction. For added expertise, a few Nationalist Chinese were lured away from the opium trade in nearby Burma to augment the road watch teams.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 314-315. As 1970 began, Communist forces began to drive the Royalist guerrillas from the Pak Beng Valley all the way south to the Mekong. A couple of checkpoint posts on the Thai-Lao border were seized. Ambassador Godley cabled Washington proposing that Operation Snake Eyes become a road watch team passively gathering military intelligence before the Royalists could mount an attack. As he awaited an answer, two Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) T-28s struck the road in early January 1970. Two Thai mercenary pilots, instigated by their government, flew out of Vientiane and struck a Chinese convoy, destroying 15 trucks. At about this time, recruitment of Commando Raiders for operations against the Chinese construction began in Luang Prabang.Conboy, Morrison, p. 315. One week later, Operation Snake Eyes was authorized on the proviso that Souvanna Phouma, who was a Neutralist, come out as opposed to the Chinese road construction through the Kingdom. With only an inactive skeleton crew stationed along Route 46 for the wet season, the actual launch date for the operation was postponed to six months thence. However, three platoons of guerrillas from Nam Yu were infiltrated 50 kilometers south of Luang Namtha to spy on Route 46; they were dubbed Teams 37A, 37B, and 37C.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 315-316. The six month setback proved to be unfortunate timing for operations against the Chinese Road. As the postponement ended, the Cambodian incursion by the U.S. raised such international furor that Operation Snake Eyes was again ordered on hold to avoid calling attention to the U.S. covert operations in Laos. By April 1971, Route 46 had been asphalted to Moung Houn, making it an all-weather road. During the first four months of 1971, the North Vietnamese moved in 400 antiaircraft guns along Route 46, along with 30 fire direction radars. The 400 antiaircraft guns, along with 25,000 troops, made the Chinese Road foreign aid project one of the most heavily defended spots in Southeast Asia. Thai reaction to this extension was a clearing sweep along the border called Operation Phalat.Conboy, Morrison, p. 318. In early August, U.S. President Richard M. Nixon closed down Nam Yu's cross-border incursions and placed an 11 kilometer no-fly zone around Route 46; this was a prelude for his later trip to China. The Chinese bulldozers were cutting the last segment of Route 46 that led into Pakbeng. The town now contained a Pathet Lao base camp. As apprehension mounted about penetration to the Thai border, on 11 September the American embassy requested a U.S. Air Force strike on the Pathet Lao base camp.Conboy, Morrison, p. 319. The prohibition of USAF flights over Route 46 did not prevent defensive fire on civilian airplanes by Chinese antiaircraft gunners. A Royal Air Lao DC-3 and an Air America C-123 were shot down during December 1971. In January 1972, an Air America pilot lost a leg to Chinese antiaircraft fire. Beginning in March 1972, Chinese troops began filtering down Route 46. By Autumn 1972, Route 46 had been extended to within 15 kilometers of Pak Beng. Much of it was dual lane paved road. Chinese forces in Laos now totaled 25,000, including a regiment of PLA infantry regulars. By now, nervous Thai authorities stationed some of their Project Unity troops along their border south of Pakbeng. This would lead into a series of clashes that became Operation Phalat and Operation Sourisak Montry. The Thais were not only intent of defending their border; they wished to combat Thai Communist insurgents.Conboy, Morrison, p. 320. Politico-military implications of the Chinese Road The implications of the Chinese Road's construction remain obscure. Originally, the CIA could not discern a reason for building this Phongsali road segment. However, it theorized that the Chinese were willing to let the North Vietnamese carry the brunt of waging war in Laos, but that security of the Lao/Chinese border was still a concern. U.S. military intelligence analysts speculated about the purpose of the Road. Was it an infiltration route to aid the Thai communist insurrection near the northern Thai border? Or was it built to counter any possible PAVN influence in the Mekong Valley? Postwar Zhou Enlai indeed insinuated to Henry Kissinger that the Chinese Road was a ploy to deny North Vietnamese any influence along the Mekong. However, he did not confirm that.Ahern, p. 202 note 64. By late 1971, international politics impinged on the Chinese Road. President Nixon was intent on capitalizing on dissension between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. To cozy up the Chinese leadership, Nixon halted the cross-border intelligence missions being staged out of northern Laos. He also barred any USAF flights within 11 kilometers of Route 46. When aircraft impinged on the construction and came under fire, he ignored the incidents. An anonymous CIA intelligence analyst drew the sole conclusion from the situation in a pithy observation: \\"Northern Laos has a new border.\\" Postwar Although Chinese road builders remained in Laos through the end of the Laotian Civil War, Routes 45 and 19 were never quite linked, so the North Vietnamese could not transit Laos to its far northwest. The new Chinese routes were not extended to Luang Prabang. After the war's end, the Lao People's Democratic Republic invited a Chinese extension of their road construction to the former royal capital. The Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia soured the deal in 1979, with the Chinese road builders invited to leave Laos. Post 1990, the political climate had warmed enough for the Lao to invite roadwork bids from Chinese firms in Yunnan. By 1993, there was a seasonal dirt track connecting the Chinese Road with Luang Prabang.Hopkins, p. 177.

The service was launched in 1972, and after initially failing it was relaunched three years later. The service gained a following, and by 1981 had hit a peak of 50 million calls in a year. Sports Phone began in New York City, but expanded to offer programming in numerous other locations, including Chicago and Detroit. The rise of sports radio stations and score tickers on television broadcasts helped reduce the popularity of Sports Phone, before an increase in Internet usage led to its demise in 2000. Callers to Sports Phone heard messages of one minute or less, with up to 30 scores provided in a given update. In addition to scores, the service's programming included news and interviews, along with a sports trivia game. Some information was recorded specifically for certain markets. The announcers for Sports Phone included future broadcasters of several franchises in the major U.S. sports leagues. History Sports Phone was first introduced on November 1, 1972, after a month of service testing. The original owner was New York Telephone employee Jack Goodfellow. Customers were charged 10 cents per one-minute phone call, with New York Telephone the recipient of all charges and a fee from Sports Phone for each call. Goodfellow's intention was for the service to make money from advertisements included with the service's updates, but the business model proved unsuccessful. In 1973, Air Time Inc., a media entity, purchased rights to the service. New York Telephone later allowed for information service operators to retain part of the call fees, and Sports Phone was relaunched in 1975. The service used multiple telephone numbers, including at least one alternate number, but the most well- known was 976-1313 (changed from 999-1313). Future broadcaster John Giannone claimed that, among New York City sports enthusiasts, \\"Everyone 45 and over can recite\\" the number. By 1976, Sports Phone was receiving an average of 65,000 calls daily. It appealed strongly to sports bettors, as it allowed users to access updates on games from the West Coast of the U.S., which frequently ended after broadcasts of television news programs. The service experienced a record period of activity in 1977, as the New York Mets were completing a trade with the Cincinnati Reds in which Tom Seaver was sent to the Reds. Sports Phone had 600,000 callers over a three-day span. The growth in Sports Phone's usage continued in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Daily call figures moved up to around 100,000 in 1979, with peaks of three times that figure on some weekend days when college or pro football games were being held. By 1981, New York Telephone was making $3 million from Sports Phone over a year; 50 million calls were made to Sports Phone that year; the only Dial-it service that received more activity was the one for off-track betting. The service expanded to markets outside New York City as well. In 1977, Sports Phone introduced a line with updates that focused on Chicago; two years later, Detroit received its own line. New Jersey and Buffalo were later added as markets with their own numbers. Daily call numbers in Chicago had hit around 65,000 by 1984, although they reportedly peaked at 175,000. Sports Phone had competition in the field by 1983, as a three-year-old national rival service, Dial-It, was receiving approximately 350,000 calls weekly. By 1985, Sports Phone's business model had changed, as its parent company, Phone Programs, was earning 2 cents per call from New York Telephone and making more than $1 million in revenue; this replaced a previous model in which Sports Phone received payments from AT&T; before the breakup of the Bell System. Atlanta, Miami, and New Orleans had updates that were aimed at those markets by 1986. Calls to Sports Phone numbers cost 50 cents by 1986. The service was facing increasing competition nationally from providers such as JD's National Score Phone, Dial Sports, and a line from USA Today. Sports Phone indicated that it planned to increase call lengths to 90 seconds following the beginning of the football schedule; this matched the time of Dial Sports' calls, which cost customers 10 cents less. A radio station dedicated to sports programming, WFAN, debuted in New York City in 1987. The initial concept for the station included score updates every 15 minutes, which were inspired by Sports Phone. WFAN positioned itself to compete against Sports Phone for the attention of the service's callers. One of the station's first promotional advertisements contained the line \\"We just made Sports Phone old news.\\" Sports Phone employee Cory Eisner said, \\"We knew right away (WFAN) was going to come after us.\\" At the same time that sports radio was reducing the service's business, it was affected by an increase in the use of pagers by sports bettors and a rise in number blocks by businesses in the New York City region. Television stations also moved to provide scores to viewers, as both CBS and NBC added periodic score updates to their pro football telecasts. A Boston-area number was introduced in 1988, to coincide with the Mike Tyson vs. Michael Spinks heavyweight championship fight. Services were also provided to the Cleveland and Phoenix markets, but proved unsuccessful. By 1990, Sports Phone had received nearly one billion calls over the service's life. By this time, though, cable television sports stations were providing score updates. In future years, the Internet would offer scores and news in real time. Caller activity at Sports Phone fell to 1,000 or less daily. The service's last general manager, radio broadcaster Don La Greca, said of Sports Phone's decline, \\"Technology that helped us update then became available to the general public, and so there was no reason to have us.\\" The service was shut down in 2000. Programming In the earliest incarnation of Sports Phone, each one-minute call allowed the caller to hear 46 seconds of sports scores. The remaining 14 seconds of the call were taken up by two commercials, each of which lasted seven seconds. When the service was reintroduced in 1975, the length of a call fell to between 57 and 58 seconds. The reduction in time allowed customers to hang up within 60 seconds, the length of a message unit as defined by the Federal Communications Commission. Recordings were not extended in cases when the announcers had not finished reciting scores; as many as 30 game scores could be fit into the required time frame. Updated score readings were usually done approximately once every 10 to 15 minutes through the conclusion of a night's sports events. For Sundays in which pro football was being played, the rate was much quicker, with just two minutes between updates. Sports Phone announcers initially received scores through ticker tape, but later placed employees in press boxes at events for quicker reporting times. Reporters who cooperated with Sports Phone by providing updates were paid at a rate of $20 per night; alternatively, staffers at Sports Phone would place calls into press boxes seeking updates. Employees also sought to record interviews with players, which were incorporated in Sports Phone's updates. Some interviews were recorded on-site, while others were done by announcers at the service's headquarters; the latter approach was used in 1976 by Howie Rose, who interviewed hockey player Darryl Sittler after he had posted a 10-point game. Sports Phone had various kinds of filler programming that it aired during days, when there were generally fewer sporting events to report on than nights. In the beginning, updates in the daytime were recorded less frequently than during the night, at 30-minute intervals. Along with updates on baseball games that were in progress, announcers incorporated news and editorial content, in addition to interviews. During the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, when Sports Phone was suffering from a lack of content, the service reported the results of a fictional best- of-seven series between the 1961 New York Yankees and 1969 New York Mets, which was simulated with the Strat-O-Matic tabletop game. According to announcer Mike Walczewski, the series led to a 400 percent spike in Sports Phone's call volume. By 1982, daytime updates had been sped up to occur about every 15 minutes. Other information that the service provided included statistics, harness racing results, and listings of pitchers in upcoming baseball games. One other type of programming that gained a following was a sports trivia game known as the \\"Quickie Quiz\\". An announcer asked a trivia question during an update, and callers contacted a different phone number to answer. Winners were given 15 seconds of air time on a Sports Phone update to discuss a topic of their choice. Some content was added in certain locations' updates to appeal to the local markets. Different sports were mentioned in updates, along with reports on teams of local interest. This included listings of golf course and tennis court wait times as well. The New York City operations center handled updates for multiple cities in the southern part of the U.S. As the popularity of Sports Phone started to decline, a new feature was launched that provided more detailed play-by-play information on games. Customers were charged 99 cents per minute for the calls, which did not have the regular service's time limit. La Greca once provided three consecutive hours of baseball play-by-play to one caller; the announcer stated that the target market for the play-by-play line was \\"the degenerate gambler.\\" In the final years of Sports Phone's existence, announcers often obtained score information on the Internet before recording updates. Announcers Writer Joe DeLessio described Sports Phone as \\"a launching pad for young voices looking to break into broadcasting.\\" The employees who announced updates for the service included future television broadcasters of the Mets and New York Yankees baseball clubs, and the New Jersey Devils and New York Islanders of the National Hockey League. La Greca, after beginning his career at Sports Phone, became a radio broadcaster for the New York Rangers and an ESPN Radio host in New York City. Mets announcer Howie Rose, who began working for Sports Phone in 1975, likened his position to \\"anchoring the CBS Evening News\\".

It is located between Podgor, Podrimlje, Drenica and Lapu≈°nik. It stretches mainly over the basin area of two rivers, lower Klina and Miru≈°a, and includes ca. 40 settlements. Orahovac is the centre of Llapusha. The area is predominantly inhabited by Albanians. Geography Llapusha is one of the parts of Metohija. It is located between Podgor, Podrimlje, Drenica and Lapu≈°nik. It is a hilly region that includes the landscape on the left riverbank of Beli Drim, from Podgor to the watershed of Miru≈°a and Klina; spreading from the western rim of southern Drenica, on the left side of the Beli Drim. It stretches mainly over the basin area of two rivers, lower Klina and Miru≈°a, and includes ca. 40 settlements. Orahovac is the centre of Llapusha. It includes the municipalities of Orahovac, Klina, Mali≈°evo and northern Suva Reka. History Part of Llapusha was included in the 1455 defter of the Brankoviƒá lands. Serbs massively migrated from the region after the Serbian Revolution and during the Serbian‚ÄìOttoman War (1876‚Äì78). During the Balkan Wars, the Serbian Army crossed Drenica and Llapusha without problems from the Albanian population thanks to local leader Sadik Rama. Llapusha was settled by Serb colonists by the Yugoslav government. Demographics Llapusha is predominantly inhabited by Muslim Albanians. Velika Hoƒça is a Serb enclave located in Orahovac municipality. There is a small Romani community. Anthropology According to ethnographical studies published in 1912, Llapusha had 44 villages with 231 Serb, 457 Albanian Muslim, 108 Catholic and 14 Muhajir families. Svetozar Raiƒçeviƒá studied Metohijski Podgor and Llapusha, publishing preliminary results in 1935. He described that: Podgor takes up the northern part of Metohija and extends from Peƒá to the village of Rudnik on the road between Peƒá and Kosovska Mitrovica. Llapusha is south of this region, on the left side of the Drim, and reaches to the Miru≈°a river. The old Serb population was almost entirely displaced, and one part was Albanianized. The Serb population in these regions, at that time, were mostly settled from the Dinaric areas. He noted that the ethnic movements in these areas were not yet completed. Serbs were more numerous than the Albanians. There were clean Serb villages and those where Serbs and Albanians lived together, only little villages with clean Albanian population. Catholic Albanians were only present in the municipality of Zlokuƒáane and in ƒêurakovac; the rest of the Albanians are all Muslims. Apart from Serbs and Albanians there were Gypsies, of two types, the Maƒëupi and Gabelji, Muslims. A special group of people were the ƒåitaci, in the villages of ƒåitak and Broƒána, who \\"don't know their ancestry, their mother tongue is Albanian, and they also know a little Serbian\\".

The procedure is a single cosmetic surgery combining abdominoplasty (a.k.a. a \\"tummy tuck\\") and liposuction.  Procedure  Some abdominoplastic procedures, while removing flesh from the abdomen, do nothing to correct for shaping around hips, thighs, and \\"love handles.\\" Alternatively, the desired look can be achieved through multiple procedures: tummy tuck first, liposuction after. Lipotuck adds to a more traditional \\"tummy tuck\\" procedure with significant liposuction to the abdomen, hips, and thighs. This procedure is engineered to create flattering curves according to traditional notions of female beauty. Lipotuck also includes a repositioning of the patient's belly button, as the excess skin removed generally includes the original one. One plastic surgeon in Australia describes Lipotuck as a procedure that \\"tends to be safer\\" because it uses tumescent liposuction, a procedures that \\"numbs and softens the fat,\\" which \\"avoid[s] bleeding.\\" Lipotuck is also more routine, and can be done as an outpatient procedure. Lipotucks can have the risk of seroma, which happens when some fluid collects in the surgical area that requires a small incision to drain afterwards. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons does not currently recognize the term \\"Lipotuck\\" as an FDA-approved brand name for specific plastic surgery treatments. However, the term was successfully trademarked in 2006 by A. H. Ahmadi, a cosmetic surgeon in Sugar Land, Texas.  Current Usage  The Lipotuck procedure is commonly used by plastic surgeons around the world; many procedures now use a combination of abdominoplasty, liposuction, and buttock contouring. Practitioners have also begun to offer \\"mommy makeovers,\\" which generally include a combination of liposuction and abdominoplasty among other enhancements, most commonly breast augmentation. These have been called the \\"mommy makeover trifecta.\\" See also * Abdominoplasty * Liposuction * Plastic surgery  References  Category:Plastic surgery Category:Surgical removal procedures ","title":"Lipotuck"},{"id":"49222807","text":"Shen Yunpu () (1916‚Äì1991) was a People's Republic of China politician.

This holy ring is worn during the rituals of pithru bali, or the prayer for the dead ancestors of the person. This ring was traditionally made of Dharba grass. However, the modern Pavithra Mothiram is made of gold. The shape of the ring is unique and it looks like a knot. Silver is also used for making the ring. It is worn on the right ring finger while performing poojas for the dead ancestors. History The origin of the holy is associated with the history of the Payyannur Subramanya Temple. The temple used to insist on wearing grass rings while performing holy rites. Later on, the priests switched to gold rings for the purpose of durability. A traditional craftsman take a whole day to one ring. They cannot eat meat or drink alcohol during their lifetime to become a holy artisan. Etymology The word 'pavithram' means 'purity' and 'Mothiram' means 'ring'. Both these words are from the Malayalam language which is the local language of the Kerala state in India. Shape There are three lines on the outer surface of the ring and they represent three rivers of human body: Ida, Pingala and Sushumna. The combination of these three rivers can awaken the vital energy or 'Kundalini Sakthi' in human beings. Trimoorthi Chaithanyam According to the belief of Payyannur Hindus, the wearing of the sacred ring can awaken the power of three gods of Hinduism: Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu. There are rigorous rituals to be followed by the maker of the ring and the person who is wearing them. They cannot eat any meat and alcohol is totally prohibited. Women have to remove the ring during menstruation. The ring is given to the customer only after being sanctified at Subramanya Temple in Payyannur. Popularity Payyannur Pavithra Mothiram is being exhibited in many museums around the world. The noted freedom fighter of India Shri C.V. Kunhambu was an expert in making this holy ring. Yoga connection According to the ancient Indian wisdom of yoga, there are three rivers of energy in human body and the smooth flow of these rivers ensure health and prosperity of the person. # Pingala on the right side of the body represent solar energy. # Ida on the left side of the spinal chord represent energy of the moon. # Sushuma in the middle represent cosmic energy. The Kundalini Shakthi lies at the bottom of these three rivers and it can evoke powerful emotions in the human body. Indians believe that the ring can arouse divine powers because of its unique design. It can be worn only on the ring finger of the right hand. A person who wears this ring is supposed to have a higher level of intelligence, happiness and wisdom. Commercial aspects The concept of the Payyannur Holy Ring has been commercially utilized. Many jewellers claim to make original Payyannur Pavithra rings. The vendors claim that the ring can bring a higher level of enlightenment and inspiration in the person using it. One holy ring can cost from $400 to $1,500 according to the quality and range. Nowadays the ring is made of 22 karat gold. How to wear The Pavithra Mothiram can be worn only on the right hand and that too only on the ring finger. According to Hindu Shasthras, each finger of the human body has different meanings and functions: # The thumb represents fire # The index finger represents the sky and the flowers. # The middle finger represents fire and holy lamps. # The ring finger represents water # The little finger represents earth and sandal paste.

It deals with the murder, of a young girl, which bears peculiar resemblance to numerous preceding deaths and puts the female protagonist, Dr Kay Scarpetta to stare in the face of what could possibly be a deep-seated, high-profile bureaucrat conspiracy and a plot which risks her own life at the mercy of a psychopathic serial killer. Teaserhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dust-patricia- cornwell/1114980126#productInfoTabs A body, oddly draped in an unusual cloth, has just been discovered inside the sheltered gates of MIT, and it's suspected the identity is that of missing computer engineering grad student Gail Shipton, last seen the night before at a trendy Cambridge bar. It appears she's been murdered, mere weeks before the trial in her $100 million lawsuit against her former financial manager, and Massachusetts Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta doubts it's a coincidence. She also fears the case may have a connection with her computer genius niece, Lucy. Characters in Dust *Kay Scarpetta - Chief Medical Examiner of Massachusetts and Director of the Cambridge Forensic Center (CFC) *Benton Wesley - FBI Profiler. \\"He was FBI right down to his Florsheim shoes, a sharp featured man with prematurely silver hair suggesting a mellow disposition that wasn't there. He was lean and hard and looked like a trial lawyer in his precisely tailored khaki suit and blue silk paisley-printed tie. I couldn't recall ever seeing him in a shirt that wasn't white and lightly starched. He had a master's degree in psychology and had been a high school principal in Dallas before enlisting in the Bureau, where he worked first as a field agent, then undercover in fingering members of the Mafia, before ending up where he'd started, in a sense.\\" *Lucy Farinelli - Kay's niece. Described as \\"a genius, an impossible little holy terror of enigmatic Latin descent whose father died when she was small. She had no one but my only sister, Dorothy, who was too caught up in writing children's books to worry much about her flesh-and-blood daughter. *Pete Marino - Detective Sergeant in the Cambridge Police Department. Described as \\"pushing fifty, with a face life had chewed on, and long wisps of greying hair parted low on one side and combed over his balding pate. At least six feet tall, he was bay-windowed from decades of bourbon or beer.\\" *Luke Zenner - Deputy chief medical examiner, at CFC *Dorothy Farinelli - Kay's sister and mother of Lucy. Kay says of her that, \\"narcissistic, male-addicted only sibling, who's guilty of criminally neglecting her only child, Lucy.'' Plot summary The plot opens with Kay Scarpetta receiving a phone call from Marino informing her about a body, later identified as Gail Shipton, recovered in a field adjoining Massachusetts Information Technology (MIT) campus. As detailed by witnesses, the body was found wrapped in an unusual white cloth, a picture of which brings back to memory a similar scene from 'Capital murders‚Äô- a case of triple killings in the capital city Washington- something that Benton had shared with her (albeit without FBI authorization) in lieu of her expertise. Haley Swansen, the boyfriend of the deceased is interrogated and it is revealed that he is transgender. The Capital murders were temporally separated, the first in April and the last two around Thanksgiving, each body clad only in panties belonging to the prior victim and posed in an open field stone's throw away from a rail track. Ed Granby, Benton's boss and head of Boston division, had refused to release key information pertaining to these cases under the pretext 'to avoid replication of this murder-style‚Äô. It is learned that the deceased had filed a $100million lawsuit against her financial advisor : ‚ÄòDouble-S‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, a firm with 6 other lawsuits - none of which reached the court since referred to as ‚Äòfrivolous‚Äô by CEO Dominic Lombardi - and under probation from SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) for irregularities. Gail Shipton's body, upon close inspection by Kay Scarpetta, was found to be wrapped in a white cloth made up of a low-stretch synthetic fabric, with conspicuous absence of injury marks (not even those incurred from defending oneself) except for pinpoint conjunctival hemorrhages, covered in fluorescent glitter and characteristically clad only in an ill-fitting panty. Benton claims that this scenario bears striking resemblance to the Capital Murders and theorizes that the killer is audacious, learned from a fact that he purposefully left the tool-box containing the cutter (to gain entry through the locked field-gate) close to the crime scene. Benton confides in Kay that a person named Martin Lagos, possibly dead, has been announced as being responsible for the triple murders. The accused's DNA had matched the blood sample from the 3rd victim's panties which Kay herself had previously confirmed to be menstrual specimen that had matched to the 2nd victim. Going by logic that the killer dresses each subsequent victim in his prior victim's panty, Kay begins to think that the DNA sample could have been tampered to frame the accused on purpose. In a twist of events, the CFC is rocked by the news of 3 additional murders which have occurred in the Double-S firm. Haley Swanson, Gail Shipton's boyfriend, is said to have been seen escaping the premises, identified not by his face but by the same hoodie that he was wearing (while previously being interrogated in light of Gail Shipton's murder.) Upon reaching the latest crime scene the 3 bodies are identified as belonging to Dominic Lombardi, his secretary and the 3rd, to everyone's surprise, Haley Swanson himself! The person who absconded with his hoodie who also happens to be the serial killer is still at large at that moment. Detailed search about the reason why Martin Lagos was framed leads them to Daniel Mrse, Martin's friend. Martin‚Äô s mom who worked as a curator at the white house was found dead in her bath-tub (in 1996), a definite murder scene made to look like an accidental death. But with evidence strongly pointing towards Daniel Mrse, Kay through phone records, realizes that Dr Geist had a phonic conversation with Ed Granby prior to the body being discovered, prompting her to doubt the intent of the phone call. Now, certain of Ed Granby's involvement, an hacked email reveals that money has exchanged hands to conceal & falsify the identify of the killer. The killer himself is later identified as Daniel Mrse - the biological son of Dominic Lombardi and thus explains the father's repeated attempts to cover up the murders. Daniel Mrse is tracked down to Florida, working in a circus. A raid of his vanity car reveals the presence of face masks made of clay, representing each of the women that he had murdered and also providing the reason for the fluorescent glitter. Further, the temporal gap in the murders coincides with the circus traveling to Cambridge and Washington.

The work was jointly commissioned by Radio France, The Proms, and the National Symphony Orchestra with contributions from Bill and Solange Brown. It was first performed on January 16, 2009 at the Salle Pleyel, Paris by the violinist Frank Peter Zimmermann and the Orchestre philharmonique de Radio France under the conductor Andrey Boreyko. Composition The concerto has a duration of roughly 19 minutes and is composed in a single movement. Thomas described the work in the score program notes, writing, \\"Flowering across a 20-minute arch, Violin Concerto No. 3, can be thought of as a series of poetic outgrowths and variations, which are organic and, at every level, concerned with transformations and connections. The violin solo is present for almost 100% of the sweeping arc, serving as the protagonist as well as fulcrum point on and around which all musical force-fields rotate, bloom and proliferate.\\" She added: =Instrumentation= The work is scored for solo violin and a large orchestra comprising piccolo, two flutes (doubling alto flute), two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, bass clarinet, bassoon, contrabassoon, four horns, four trumpets, two trombones, bass trombone, tuba, six percussionists, piano, celesta, two harps, and strings. Reception Reviewing the North American premiere by the violinist Jennifer Koh and the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington D.C. on June 9, 2011, Anne Midgette of The Washington Post praised the concerto, despite noting a lukewarm reception by the audience. She wrote, \\"Augusta Read Thomas writes music that is dense and smart but also listenable. Thick with complex rhythms, bright with textures, dappled with particular shades of dissonance alternating with snatches of melody, it doesn‚Äôt blatantly try to seduce the hearer, but it doesn‚Äôt want to be off-putting, either.\\" The work was also lauded by Tim Smith of The Baltimore Sun who wrote, \\"Structured in a single, 20-minute span, the vividly orchestrated score 'juggles' ideas and rhythms to create an absorbing dialogue between soloist and orchestra.

Hong Gildong, an illegitimate son of a nobleman and his lowborn concubine, is the main character of the story. Gifted with supreme intelligence and supernatural abilities, he steals from rich and corrupt aristocrats, which has drawn him comparisons to famous bandits like the English folk hero Robin Hood and Australia‚Äôs Ned Kelly. Historical sources point to the existence of a bandit named Hong Gildong who was arrested in 1500, but the historical inspiration for the character was the Korean bandit and folk hero Im Kkeokjeong, who lived in the early 16th century. Joanna Rurarz (2009). Historia Korei. Dialog. . P.237 Since the novel first appeared, the character of Hong Gildong has become a mainstay of Korean culture and literature. In Korea today, Hong Gildong is a common placeholder name, similar to John Doe in the United States.DBDic.com (ÎîîÎπÑÎîïÎã∑Ïª¥) (2001). Neo geugeo ani? ÎÑà Í∑∏Í±∞ ÏïÑÎãà? (Did you know that?). . Retrieved September 22, 2006 from Naver Books. Charles Montgomery of the website Korean Literature in Translation explains, ‚ÄúIn Korean literature Hong Gildong is legion. He is a fixture from one of the most important early novels in Hangul ‚Äì he is the first truly ‚ÄòKorean‚Äô main character.‚Äù Professor Minsoo Kang writes in the foreword to his translation, ‚ÄúThe Story of Hong Gildong is arguably the single most important work of classic (i.e., premodern) prose fiction of Korea, in terms of not only its literary achievement but also of its influence on the larger culture.‚ÄùKang, Minsoo. The Story of Hong Gildong. ‚ÄúIntroduction.‚Äù New York: Penguin, 2016. NPR‚Äôs Ari Shapiro explained on Fresh Air, \\"Sometimes, a single character can help define a country's sense of self. Here in the U.S., you might think of Jay Gatsby in The Great Gatsby or Superman. In North and South Korea, it's Hong Gildong.‚Äù Plot Various versions of Hong Gildong jeon exist, each including different details but following the same skeleton and timeline. The story is usually divided into three equal parts, each occurring in different settings. The first part is set in the residence of the Hong Family. After waking from an auspicious dream, the High Minister, Hong Mo, lies with a lowborn maid, who conceives Hong Gildong. The story then shifts to Gildong‚Äôs childhood where he masters his physical, mental, and magical abilities. The first part concludes with Hong Gildong stopping an assassin‚Äôs attempt on his life and then leaving the Hong residence, unsatisfied with his status as a secondary son. In the second part, Hong Gildong becomes the leader of a band of outlaws whom he names Hwalbindang (‚Äúleague of those who help the impoverished‚Äù).Kang, Minsoo. The Story of Hong Gildong. ‚ÄúIntroduction.‚Äù New York: Penguin, 2016. Gildong and his band steal from locations where wealth is held throughout the country, like storehouses and temples. As his robberies become bolder and more frequent, he draws the attention of the King and ultimately ends up leaving the country in self-imposed exile. The third part takes place in the country of Yul. Hong Gildong starts over with the Hwalbindang at the island of Jae and then overthrows the King of Yul to become King. He rules as a benevolent king and begins his own family at Yul, in which he treats his secondary and primary sons equally. Literary context, themes and history Authorship of the novel is generally attributed to Heo Gyun (ÌóàÍ∑†), a radical intellectual who long dreamed of changing Korea into a fair society with less strict class hierarchies. The first attribution to Heo Gyun is from the writings of Yi Sik (1584‚Äì1647), his former student. Furthermore, Heo Gyun is said to be the author because of his radical ideas of political revolution, which are projected in Hong Gildong‚Äôs journey from secondary son to king. It is believed Heo Gyun wrote the book during the late 16th or early 17th century. However, in recent years, emerging scholarship has contradicted previously accepted theories on the authorship of Hong Gildong jeon. In a 2013 article in Azalea: Journal of Korean Literature & Culture, Minsoo Kang argues that the claim for Heo Gyun as author of the novel is based on flawed and biased scholarship. He proposes instead that the extant version of the novel was written around the mid-19th century, or not long before that, \\"by an anonymous writer of secondary or commoner status.\\" Hong Gildong is often viewed as a reflection of its time. Depending on the Heo Gyun authorship model or the one that Kang proposes, this perspective differs. Kang suggests that peace and prosperity in 18th century Korea under the rule of Yeongjo and Jeonjo allowed for increased social mobility and literacy. This led to the development of a market for popular fiction, and Hong Gildong jeon is exemplary of these kinds of novels. There are more than 34 existing manuscripts of Hong Gildong jeon. Scholars are uncertain which, if any, is the original manuscript, but some evidence suggests that the pilsa 89 manuscript is the oldest surviving version. Cultural legacy In addition to its reputation as a literary work, Hong Gildong jeon has become widely known in Korean culture through various adaptations across different mediums. The story has inspired films, TV shows, comics, literary re-tellings, and video games, and continues to be frequently adapted. There is a Hong Gildong theme park in Jangseong County, traditionally thought to be the character‚Äôs birthplace, and a Hong Gildong festival is held in Jangseong each year.

Biography As Yusuf was an eunuch, he was given the title of ƒÄghƒÅ (also spelled Aqa), which was common amongst eunuchs who served at the court. He enjoyed great prestige in the harem of king Abbas I. Apart from being the \\"master of the hunt\\" (mƒ´r shekƒÅr-bƒÅshi) which he was appointed as in 1629, he was also the master of the gholams of the royal harem, as well as the representative of the interests of the Armenian community of Isfahan, and was in fact the most powerful person in the Safavid harem until the reign of king Safi I (r. 1629‚Äì1642), when he and his family were purged. As Yusuf Agha was the supervisor of the Armenian community in the capital, he has been linked to the great rise of the Armenians in the Safavid bureaucratic and mercantile organ. His position made him the center point of the Safavid silk production and cultivation, as not only was he the representative of the merchants who traded it, but his own relative, Qazaq Khan Cherkes, was the governor of Shirvan at the time, while one of his intimates, Manuchihr Khan administered Gaskar in Gilan ‚Äì chief production centers of Safavid silk. Being the \\"master of the hunt\\", he acted as the liaison (or, contact) between the court and the Armenians of the capital, and presented their grievances and requests to the king. As the Armenians had grown to a powerful and rich faction within the empire by that time, they were willing to fund those causes lavishly which they deemed as important. Yusuf Agha himself was one of those who highly benefitted from this, as when he was executed in 1632 under Safi's reign, the exorbitant sum of 450,000 tomans was found in his possession.

Although it is estimated that around 8000 people have taken scientology-related courses in Norway, the church only has around 100 active members. Scientologikirken has only one official church, in Oslo, which has located and relocated among various places within the capital, ranging from fashionable offices in a thriving city center on Karl Johans gate and Tollbugata, to its current location on Gr√ºnerl√∏kka, in strong contrast to other Church of Scientology headquarters. The church is currently located at Torggata 28 next to Youngstorget in downtown Oslo. Scientologikirken has a history of settling legal cases out of court, it was sentenced to refund 600.000 Norwegian kroner worth of course fees to a former member, in addition to the unsuccessful 6-year-long legal battle to grant it status as a religion. Due to the small amount of active members and no governmental subsidies, the church has an overall small income, relying mostly on participants paying for single courses. In August 2015,a banner was placed covering the front facade of the Scientologikirken, saying \\"New homes, coming soon\\", indicating the church longer being present there. They have since moved back to their old headquarters in Tollbugata, but leaving behind nine months (292,434 Norwegian kroner, or $33,707) of unpaid rent.  Controversies  The church was also accused of contributing to murder in the high profile case of Kaja Ballo's suicide. Ballo was the daughter of parliamentary minister Olav Gunnar Ballo. As a result of the bad light that was shed upon the church, it has become vastly unpopular and controversial in Norway. Members usually keep a low profile and are reluctant to share their religious beliefs. Norwegians in general regard Scientologikirken as a cult. Despite low membership numbers, the Norwegian community has made a name for itself among opposition-groups. There are often protests outside of the Oslo church, with Anonymous being very present. This is not the only reason; Andreas Heldal-Lund is a known critic of Scientology, and is the founder of xenu.net and Operation Clambake.

In 1918, Irish land surveyor Arthur Oliver Wheeler named the mountain because of its castle-like appearance, which seemed to stand guard over the southern portion of the Columbia Icefield. Castleguard was first ascended in 1919 by the Interprovincial Boundary Commission, which determined the exact location of the boundary between British Columbia and Alberta along the continental divide. Author Lewis Freeman, in his 1925 book Roof of the Rockies, described the view from the summit: Geology Castleguard is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Castleguard is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. ReferencesFurther reading * Robert W.

He is also the son of the famous Qurayshite statesmen, Suhayl ibn Amr and brother of Abu Jandal ibn Suhayl.  Life  Abdullah ibn Suhayl was born in approximately 594 and was the son of Suhayl ibn Amr from Banu Amir branch. His mother, Atika bint Awf was from Banu Amir also.  Biography  Abdullah had become a Muslim before the Battle of Badr, but did not have a way to join the Muslims in Medina. Leaving Mecca and being openly Muslim was difficult for Abdullah because of the powerful influence of his father and his esteemed place in Quraysh. Abdullah concocted a plan to switch sides and join forces with the Muslims at Badr. He rode to Badr with the rest of the pagan Quraysh and his father and waited until the two forces camped close enough to each other that they were both within eyesight of each other. With the Muslim camp so close, Abdullah escaped to the side of Muhammad and fought alongside them the next day. His relatively early conversion to Islam and his participation in the Battle of Badr as a Muslim places him in the esteemed position of the Sahabah. He is said to have emigrated to Ethiopia in the first migration. Abdullah ibn Suhayl also participated in the Battle of Uhud, the Battle of the Trench, and the Battle of Yamama.  Death  Abdullah was martyred at the Battle of Yamama at 38 years old in 632 CE. His brother in law, Abu Hudhayfa ibn 'Utba, foster nephew, Salim Mawla Abu Hudhayfa, and second cousin, Zayd ibn al-Khattab were all killed seconds after him. After his death, Khalid ibn al-Walid said that he had fulfilled his duty and that God's messenger was pleased with him when he died, and prayed for him to go to the highest heaven. He was mourned deeply by his brother, Abu Jandal ibn Suhayl and his father, Suhayl ibn Amr. His father would sometimes pray to Allah to grant mercy and to bestow his grace to Abdullah.

It premiered on FOX on February 9, 2015 and was written by Ken Woodruff, and directed by Nick Copus. In this episode, Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) continue following Dr. Crane's killing spree. The episode was watched by 5.63 million viewers and received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the ending as scary but felt the subplots were weak. Plot Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) has been captured and is locked up in a rowdy prison-like area. Meanwhile, Dr. Gerald Crane (Julian Sands) continues experimenting with his fear toxin. This time he tests it on himself to re- experience his greatest fear: his wife being killed in a fire. Falcone (John Doman) decides to put an end to Cobblepot's (Robin Lord Taylor) debt to Maroni (David Zayas). He meets with him and Maroni agrees to end his feud with Falcone and forswears vengeance on Oswald, as long as he receives the services of a judge in Falcone's pocket. Falcone tells Cobblepot he also has to redecorate the nightclub, as Falcone is giving it to him to run. Falcone reminds Oswald that without cash flow, they lose influence, and without influence, their organization becomes a house of cards. After receiving information from Nygma (Cory Michael Smith), Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) realize Crane created the toxin after his wife's death, hoping that people use it to overcome their deepest fears. Bruce (David Mazouz) goes on a trip to the forest to challenge himself, but runs into difficulties. He's then joined by Alfred (Sean Pertwee), who tells him that he came looking for him, but decided to let him crawl the last hundred yards up the hill on his own, to let Bruce develop his independence. Cobblepot is visited later by Maroni, who tells him that when Falcone dies, Cobblepot will die too. In a cabin in the woods, Dr. Crane injects his son Jonathan (Charlie Tahan) with a high level of the toxin, causing him to have a breakdown featuring the cabin's scarecrow. Gordon and Bullock locate them, and when Gerald opens fire and proclaims himself without fear, Gordon and Bullock return fire, killing him and take Jonathan to a hospital. In the prison, Mooney kills Mace, the prisoner's leader, and promises to protect the other prisoners, who, it turns out are having their organs harvested for sale. In the hospital, Gordon is notified by the doctor that because of the high levels of toxins, Jonathan (while he will live) may never overcome his fear. The episode ends as Jonathan is tormented by visions of scarecrows. Reception=Viewers= The episode was watched by 5.63 million viewers, with a 1.8 rating among 18-49 adults. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 8.39 million viewers, and a 3.0 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Critical reviews= \\"The Scarecrow\\" received generally positive reviews. The episode received a rating of 64% with an average score of 6.0 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: \\"What should have been an exciting examination into the origins of an infamous villain becomes a tedious and polluted rendering of legendary Batman folklore in 'The Scarecrow'.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.0 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"'The Scarecrow' gave us a freaky bit of Jonathan Crane backstory and a good Bruce/Alfred bonding moment, but the rest either didn't make sense, was boring, or worked to undo and deflate previous set ups.\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"C\\" grade and wrote, \\"Week in and week out, I've been saying that the reason Gotham fails so miserably from one episode to the next is because it never commits to a specific tone or genre, and has a haphazard approach to character development. While I think that still holds true, the critique may need a little modification at this point. For a while, Gotham was failing to walk a fine line between being a cartoonish comedy about pre-Batman Gotham, and a police procedural with some gritty, but also fun elements. One episode would see Bullock and Gordon doing the buddy-cop schtick, and the next would see Gordon dealing with his own personal issues or going toe-to-toe with the corruption within the GCPD. With 'The Scarecrow,' the show seems to have more fully committed to its procedural stylings. The wild tonal shifts are still present, but it seems as if the show may have decided what it wants to be.\\" References External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 1) episodes Category:2015 American television episodes ","title":"The Scarecrow (Gotham episode)"},{"id":"49223633","text":"Tembilahan (Jawi:ÿ™ŸÖÿ®ŸäŸÑÿßŸáŸÜ ) is a town and district of Indragiri Hilir Regency, Riau province of Indonesia.

Concept In 2078 A.D., there is a Great Extinction Event. Five teenagers are cryogenically frozen as part of Project Guardian. They awake in 41,740,659 A.D. (expressed as \\"41 million years later\\") to a wildly different Earth. With the help of a robot they must resettle the planet, opposed by another preserved human with an army of robots. They were supposed to be frozen for 50 million years but an earthquake contaminated their cryogenic pods and caused an early emergency-release. Their parents are still trapped in contaminated cryo-pods and cannot be released safely so the teens must rebuild civilization alone. They are tasked with finding a replacement accelerator ring (protected by a cloaking field) so that their base can regain enough power to facilitate repairs. They wear crystal-driven power suits which enhance their strength and speed and protect them from the elements as they venture out into a mutant wilderness. They also carry energy guns with a stun setting. Their suits have buttons which summon a hovercycle or put on a protective helmet (another button removes it, collapsing into a back storage compartment) or shoot a grappling hook with retractable cord to pull them up instead of climbing. There are giant Herbivores who resemble Sauropods except they are mammals.

It is in a remote location with rocky outcrops, old growth forests and views of the surrounding hills.Virginia's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1999 The area is part of the Mountain Lake Wilderness Cluster. Location and access Boundary of the Mottesheard wild area as identified by the Wilderness Society Mottesheard is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia about 5 miles west of Waiteville, West Virginia. Waiteville Rd (WVa 17) is on the northwest of the area, Limestone Rd.(WVa 15) and Old Waiteville Rd (Va 636) is to the southwest, Mudlick Rd. to the southeast, and Crowder Rd. (WVa 20) to the northeast. There are gated forest roads and abandoned jeep trails passing through the area. Access is possible from Wilson Creek Road that intersects Limestone Road southeast of Waiteville. There are no official trails within the area, but there are roads that can be gated when the Forest Service wants to limit access. The roads are shown on National Geographic Trail Map 788. Natural history The habitat of the southern Appalachians is rich in its biological diversity with nearly 10,000 species, some not found anywhere else. This diversity is related to the many ridges and valleys which form isolated communities in which species evolve separately from one another. The region lies south of the glaciers that covered North America 11,000 years go. To escape the glaciers, northern species retreated south to find refuge in the southern Appalachians. When the glaciers retreated, many of these species remained along with the southern species that were native to the area. The diversity includes trees, mosses, millipedes and salamanders. Tower_mustard plant, \\"Arabis glabra\\"Mottesheard contains the tower-mustard plant, listed by the state as rare, and streams in the area flow into creeks inhabited by the James River Spinymussel, a federally endangered species. The tower-mustard plant (Arabis glabra) has creamy white flowers that bloom from May to June. The James River spinymussel is a small fresh water mussel slightly less than three inches long with occasional short spines on each valve. Topography Mottesheard is in the Ridge and Valley Province of the Appalachian Mountains. The province consists of a thick layer of sedimentary rock that has undergone folding and/or faulting to create a series of ridges and valleys. During the sedimentation process fossils were formed leaving evidence of life existing millions of years ago. The fossils can be seen in rock exposures throughout the mountains. The topography is typical of the Central Appalachian Province, with long ridges dissected by steep draws and limited flat areas along streams. Elevations range from valleys at 2200 ft to Arnold Knob at 3932 ft and Mottesheard Mountain at 3740 ft. It is lies on both sides of Potts Mountain, a ridge that extends along the West Virginia-Virginia border. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Mottesheard was included in the inventoried roadless areas, and therefore protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The area includes several types of Forest Service management prescriptions‚Äî\\"Black Bear Habitat\\", \\"Remote Backcountry‚ÄîNon-Motorized\\" and \\"Old Growth With Disturbance\\". \\"Black Bear Habitat\\" is managed to maintain a natural, forested appearance with a minimum of roads to provide a secluded habitat. Motorized use is restricted during the spring to late summer to reduce disturbance of females with cubs. \\"Remote Backcountry‚ÄîNon-Motorized\\" is managed for recreational opportunities in large remote areas where users can obtain a degree of solitude. And \\"Old Growth With Disturbance\\" is managed with an emphasis on protection and restoration of the old growth forest with associated wildlife, botanical, recreational, scientific, educational, cultural and spiritual values. Nearby Wildlands Mottesheard is in the Mountain Lake Wilderness Cluster. Nearby wildlands recognized as one of Virginia's \\"Mountain Treasures\\" by the Wilderness Society are: * Hickory Flats * Cascades (conservation area) ReferencesExternal links * Topographic map of area * Driving Directions to intersection of Routes 635 and 613 from Pembroke, VA.

She was the daughter of Carel van Cracauw, the Dutch envoy to Copenhagen, a rich heiress and related to rich bankers. In 1647, she married the rich Swedish merchant Magnus Durell, who had been ennobled not long before their wedding. She followed her spouse to Sweden and settled on his recently acquired country estate, Vallen Castle near Laholm. The family of her spouse had, two years before her wedding, been given a contract from the crown to provide the Swedish army with knitted socks, which had not yet been fulfilled. The contract formally belonged to her spouse, but as he was often absent and busy with his position as country governor and president of G√∂ta Court, Birgitta Durell was given the responsibility to organized and manage this business. Birgitta Durell was described as initiative and thrifty. She organized the entire enterprise around the Vallen Castle. She held lessons for her staff, and then had them in turn give lessons to the surrounding peasantry, in the art of knitting known as binge, which was therefore introduced by her. Next, she imported and bought wool, which was distributed to the peasantry of Halland, who were then employed to knit socks for the army on her commission. The Vallen Castle or Laholm industry was hugely successful, and the contract with the crown belonged to the same family for decades: after the death of Birgitta Durell, it was managed by her daughter Magna Birgitta Durell (1653‚Äì1709), then by the widow of her grandson, Clara Sabina Lillieh√∂√∂k (1686‚Äì1758), thereafter by her great granddaughter Magdalena Eleonora Meck (1717‚Äì1766), until the family lost the contract and it was taken over by Charlotta Richardy over a hundred years later.

After starting up POW!, he and his team considered making a TV series based on such a super power. Neil Biswas then took Lee's original idea and wrote the pilot episode, developing the central character and the world around him. With the help of his writing team, Biswas developed the mythology for the first series: Stan Lee's original idea of a lucky charm that is given to a compulsive gambler became an ancient bracelet that Harry Clayton wakes up with on his wrist after a night spent with the mysterious Eve. With his gambling addiction having cost him his wife and daughter, and being in debt for thousands of pounds to a casino owner, Clayton soon begins to use the bracelet to his own advantage. The series is executive produced by Richard Fell and Gareth Neame, with Stan Lee (who has one cameo per season) and Gill Champion serving as co-executive producers. Neil Biswas, who was the lead writer of the first season, also co-executive produced and was credited as co-creator of the show.

Harry also runs across the Wu Chi triad, a deadly gang that is intent on destroying the bracelets, believing they are an abomination. Samuel Blake, an operative with MI6, is the adopted son of the leader of the Wu Chi, using his double connections to frame Harry for the murder (rather than suicide) of Isabella Augustine. With Harry's access to his own support group of police and family now limited, Blake works to retrieve Harry's bracelet.

He is also the brother of Abdullah ibn Suhayl and son of Suhayl Ibn Amr, the orator of Quraysh.  Biography  Abu Jandal was an early convert to Islam, following the lead of his brother Abdullah ibn Suhayl. Due to the position of their father Suhayl ibn Amr in the leadership of Quraysh, Abu Jandal and Abdullah were persecuted and hid their conversion. Abdullah converted to Islam and cleverly rode with the vanguard of Quraysh to Badr where he switched sides and joined the Prophet and battled against the pagans of Quraysh and his father the next day. When Suhayl learned that his second son was a Muslim, he had him beaten and locked at home. Abu Jandal remained in this state under close watch and harsh punishment for several years until the time of the Treaty of Hudabiyyah. Hearing that the Prophet Muhammad was near Mecca and coming, Abu Jandal, bound in chains escaped and ran to the camp of the Muslims at Hudaybiyyah. The Muslims were shocked to see his condition.Islamiat for O levels by Farkhanda Noor According to the treaty, any Meccans who attempted to become Muslim and flee to Medina without the permission of his guardian(s) would be returned to Mecca. Upon seeing his son and understanding that he was attempting to flee to the security of the Prophet, Suhayl pointed at his son and informed them that he would be the first person returned to Quraysh. Abu Jandal exclaimed to the Muslim people that they would return him to the polytheists when he comes to them as a Muslim. Unfortunately, the Prophet had to return Abu Jandal but encouraged him to remain steadfast. After some time, Abu Jandal and the other people who had been returned to Mecca thought that they would simply escape from Mecca and settle somewhere other than Medina. In doing this, they were able to escape their persecution and allow the treaty to stay intact and keep themselves from being returned to Mecca. Abu Jandal and others led by Abu Baseer gathered at a small town near the Jeddah coast called Ghufar, and their news spread to others wishing to escape Mecca as Muslims. Eventually, this group of about 70 men with Abu Baseer and Abu Jandal formed a raiding party to ravage the Meccan trade caravans on their way to and from Syria. For almost a year, Quraysh was unable to get passed Abu Jandal and his peers, crushing the Meccan economy. Quraysh then wrote the Prophet in Medina asking him to please welcome the men at Ghufar into Medina and allow them to join him away from the Meccan caravans. Abu Baseer died soon after reading the Prophet's invitation to Medina, and Abu Jandal led the caravan of men and all of the wealth they had amassed to Medina. When they arrived at Medina, Abu Jandal greeted and reunited with his brother, Abdullah. For some time, Abu Jandal, Abdullah and every other companion of the Prophet remained in Medina. But some time later, Abdullah and Abu Jandal come back to their home in Mecca and persuaded their father to meet the Prophet and convert to Islam and they succeeded. Later, in 632, Abdullah went to and was martyred in the Battle of Al-Yamamah. Abu Jandal heard the news of his brother's martyrdom and informed his father of it. Both Abu Jandal and his father, Suhayl, mourned Abdullah and then decided to join the Muslim army. Therefore, they fought in all or almost every following battle, such as the Battle of Al-Yarmuk.  Death  Al- Dhahabi reported that Abu Jandal died in the Plague of Emmaus in present-day Jordan in 18 AH or 639 CE.

It premiered on FOX on February 16, 2015 and was written by series developer Bruno Heller, and directed by Jeffrey Hunt. In this episode, James Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Lee Thompkins (Morena Baccarin) go on a date to Haly's Circus, and end up investigating the murder of one of the performers. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne (David Mazouz) sets to investigate Wayne Enterprises. The episode was watched by 6.19 million viewers and received generally positive reviews. While Fish Mooney's storyline was criticized, Cameron Monaghan's performance was universally acclaimed. Plot Barbara Kean (Erin Richards) returns to her penthouse apartment to see Selina Kyle (Camren Bicondova) and Ivy Pepper (Clare Foley) squatting there. Selina adds James Gordon (Ben McKenzie) left his keys and Barbara says \\"screw him\\". Gordon and Lee Thompkins (Morena Baccarin) have a date at the Haly's Circus. However, during a performance, several performers have a fight between their respective families, the Graysons and Lloyds. Gordon and Lee visit the supposed reason for the fight, snake dancer Lila Valeska, in her trailer only to be received by her son, Jerome (Cameron Monaghan), who reports he had not seen her since the morning. They then discover her corpse in a cart and Gordon accuses the ringmaster (James Monroe Iglehart). The ringmaster admits having discovered the corpse earlier, but did not say anything so as to not interfere with the show, planning on giving her a funeral later. In the prison, Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) acts as the leader of the inmates so they can break free of the prison. When the guards arrive to escort a prisoner for organ harvesting, Mooney has her crew beat the prisoner to death so it's now worthless as an organ donor. When Fish defies the jailer's orders, they say the \\"manager\\" would like to talk to her. Alfred Pennyworth (Sean Pertwee) discovers Bruce Wayne (David Mazouz) investigating Wayne Enterprises, claiming he's discovered corruption within the company. Gordon and Lee then interrogate circus psychic Paul Cicero (Mark Margolis), who claims to hear Lila from \\"beyond\\". They bring Jerome too, where Gordon accuses him of murdering Lila, as Cicero had been trying to mislead the police with clues about the murder weapon, and Jim figures he's protecting someone. Jerome denies everything, but when it is revealed that Cicero is his father, he begins to laugh maniacally. He finally admits he killed his mother for being a \\"whore\\", and Gordon arrests him. Later, the two warring circus families reconcile when John Grayson and Mary Lloyd get engaged. Barbara tries to get Gordon back, but changes her mind when she sees him kissing Lee in the police station locker room. In Oswald Cobblepot's nightclub, Victor Zsasz (Anthony Carrigan) visits Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) to tell him that Carmine Falcone is unhappy with how business at the club has been going, and that Oswald may not be the right person to manage the club. Cobblepot seems afraid for his safety, until Victor reveals a brainwashed Butch Gilzean (Drew Powell) and says he is now in service to Cobblepot, having worked on him on \\"his basement for a few weeks\\". Bruce visits the Wayne Enterprises board to confront them about the cases of corruption and their involvement in Arkham Plan, although they deny everything. In the prison, the guard Thomas Schmidt (Elliot Villar) tells Mooney that the manager wants to meet with her. Reception=Viewers= The episode was watched by 6.19 million viewers, with a 2.1 rating among 18-49 adults. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 9.25 million viewers, and a 3.4 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Critical reviews= \\"The Blind Fortune Teller\\" received generally positive reviews, especially for Monaghan's performance as a character widely interpreted (but never officially confirmed) as a younger version of the Joker. The episode received a rating of 61% with an average score of 7.3 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: \\"The action and use of the ensemble in 'The Blind Fortune Teller' add excitement to an otherwise disappointing introduction of an iconic Batman villain.\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"C+\\" grade and wrote, \\"'The Blind Fortune Teller' is another dull, convoluted, poorly-written hour of television, but there are a few performances that stand out. Watching Gotham every week is such a frustrating experience because of how banal the procedural elements are and how shallow and haphazard the narrative is; but it's also frustrating because there are moments when characters shine, or when a certain sequence plays out with wonderful tension and patience. So many episodes of the show have given hints as to what Gotham could be if only it could find some narrative depth and focus, and 'The Blind Fortune Teller' is another one of those episodes.\\" References External links  * * Category:2015 American television episodes Category:Gotham (season 1) episodes Category:Matricide in fiction ","title":"The Blind Fortune Teller"},{"id":"49224084","text":"Uranotaenia is a genus of mosquitoes containing at least 270 species.

The complex was built in 1938 and was listed in the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 9 December 2013. The buildings represent one of the most significant and important examples of early 20th-century functionalist architecture in Aarhus. The complex is situated on a hill slope immediately south of the Riis Skov urban forest in the Skovvejskvarteret neighbourhood of the inner city. It consists of two 6-floor apartment buildings facing the road Skovvejen and the Bay of Aarhus respectively, with two older villas placed between them in an atrium garden. The villas are from 1896 (Villa H√∏jbo) and 1900 (Villa Sunhill) and were remodeled in the years 1936‚Äì38 when the apartment blocks were built. The complex is today a condominium.  History  In the early 20th century the ideals of historicism were replaced by functionalism which in Denmark became popular after the Stockholm Exhibition of 1930. Functionalism broke with the former historical imitations and use of decorations to focus on materials and their function. Attention was paid to use of materials that could be mass-produced and tying form, function and technique together. In Aarhus the style is best exemplified by the University by C.F. M√∏ller and Kay Fisker, the City Hall by Arne Jacobsen and Erik M√∏ller and Klintegaarden by Hans Ove Christensen. Today the complex fits into the surroundings with many buildings of similar size but at the time it was built it towered above the city as one the tallest buildings in it on a hill high above it. Architecturally the buildings were unique for the time with simple features and a clean white exterior. The engineer Ove Christensen had previously designed four other functionalist developments in the city and he made Klintegaarden one of the most modern residential buildings at the time.  Facilities  The complex is designed with community and collectivism in mind. The two villas on the property were remodeled and fit into the new complex as community units with banquet room, billiard rooms, playrooms for children and guest rooms. There was a small restaurant where it was possible to eat or order food to the apartments and a cleaning service. The space between the apartment blocks and around the central villa was made into a garden with fountains and trees from the former gardens of the villas. The interior was modern for the time with refrigerators, garbage chutes for every unit, central heating in all rooms and both hot and cold water in both kitchen and bathroom ‚Äì a luxury in the interwar period. In the building facing the Bay of Aarhus there was elevators and in the basements electrical washing facilities and an underground parking garage so cars and bicycles were removed from the street. The overall vision with the many communal facilities was to create a community where the residents lived close and had a clean safe, environment to play in while everyday life wasn't hampered by daily chores. The cost of the facilities was covered through the rent which added a collectivist aspect. Over time the public facilities have disappeared. The villas have been made into private homes and the apartments changed from rents to condos. The original ideals were unique for the time and an experiment which drew much attention but it did not last.  Architecture  The apartment complexes are 6 stories of concrete elements topped with a flat roof. The windows sit flush with the facade in vertical rows broken by exterior or interior balconies. On the side facing the water, the balconies are round while they are rectangular towards the courtyard and street. The apartment complexes are made of thin elements which is very visible in the exterior, giving the massive buildings a lightness. On the water-facing side, the buildings have many maritime elements highlighting the relationship with the water and port below. On the roof height differences have been used to create a displacement reminiscent of a ship's bridge and the long communal rooftop terrace is guarded by a slender rail with round windows on the walls behind, inspired by the sundeck on an ocean liner. The narrow hallways inside have rounded windows to the outside given the feel of a cabin hallway. Klintegaarden 4.jpgThe roadside facade of Klintegaarden.

Life and career=Birth, education and early career= FitzGerald was born in Hobart, Tasmania in 1938. He was educated at the Launceston Church Grammar School, graduating in 1956. Between 1957 and 1960, FitzGerald attended the University of Tasmania. One of the courses FitzGerald took, Asian History run by New Zealander George Wilson, helped him to develop an interest in Asia. FitzGerald joined the Australian Public Service in the Department of External Affairs in 1961. He learnt to speak Chinese at RAAF Point Cook. He arrived in Hong Kong in 1962 on official duties, which he described as the \\"centre of China-watching\\". He enjoyed his time there immensely, but did feel uncomfortable with the city being still being a British colony. He resigned from the external affairs department in 1966 when he disagreed with the then government's support for the United States' military intervention during the Vietnam War and also the government's refusal to recognise the Communist government of China. FitzGerald received his PhD from the Australian National University. During his studies, in 1968, he visited Quanzhou, Shanghai and several other cities on a student tour at the height of the Chinese Cultural Revolution‚Äîthe streets were filled with posters, loudspeakers and truck-loads of drummers broadcasting to pedestrians. His thesis discussed contemporary China‚Äôs relations with overseas Chinese. In 1971, FitzGerald was appointed Fellow in Far Eastern Studies at the Australian National University. =China: FitzGerald becomes advisor then ambassador= In 1971, FitzGerald, as China adviser, was a key member of a political delegation to China led by then Labor opposition leader Gough Whitlam.

In 1988, FitzGerald was the Chairman of the Committee to Advise on Australia‚Äôs Immigration Policies which submitted a report, known as the FitzGerald Report. The committee found that Australian immigration policy had become captive of migrant lobbies.FitzGerald quoted in That year he also championed Asian studies in the context of national education policy. He gave the 1990 Buntine Oration, which he titled \\"Asia, Education and the Australian Mind.\\" In 2015 FitzGerald released his book Comrade Ambassador: Whitlam's Beijing Envoy. Author Billy Griffiths, reviewing the book, wrote that it was thoughtful and engaging, covering a transformative period of Australian history.

The church functions both as a road church and is the parish church for Bryn. History Chancel in Bryn Church The church was built in 1861 based on plans by the architect Peter H√∏ier Holtermann.Bakken, T. J. 1961. Bryn kirke, 1861‚Äì1961. Oslo: V. B√¶rums menighetsraad.The church was consecrated during a major ceremony on June 28, 1861. Gunder Kristensen Krydsby from Lommedalen transported the two church bells from Oslo by horse and wagon. The newspaper Ringeriges Ugeblad (now Ringerikes Blad) wrote that: \\"Already early in the morning, crowds were seen along all the roads heading to the church. About 800 admission tickets were given out. The church opened at 9:30, and those that had tickets were able to enter and take their place. At 10:00 the procession set out from the Bryn farm. It consisted of ten priests from the deanery. The town's new and very attractive church was consecrated.\\" The church is made of brick and can accommodate 400 people. There is a cemetery next to the church.Kjernlie, Eira. 2015. Slipper gravstell med fellesordning. Budstikka (August 24). An urn with the remains of the film director Rasmus Breistein is kept at the church.Norsk biografisk leksikon: Rasmus Breistein. Some of the church's furnishings were newly purchased, some were received as gifts, and some were transferred from the medieval Tanum Church. The chancel decoration was created by Emanuel Vigeland, the brother of the better known Gustav Vigeland. The church was restored in 1959‚Äì60 by the architect Finn Bryn (1890-1975). In 2007‚Äì2008 the church spire was repaired, and an old scroll was found in the soffit relating how the church's foundation stone was laid, who had participated in the construction of the church, and who had paid for the work. The cemetery, measuring 70 m√•l (), is planned to be expanded by 60 m√•l () and excavation work has started. The digging has revealed a number of archaeological finds from the early Iron Age from 500 BC and from the Middle Ages, including graves and traces of settlement from the Iron Age.

Plot A 42-year-old writer finds that a small octopus has attached itself to the head of his aging dachshund, Lily. Background Rowley, a 43-year-old paralegal and screenwriter, had sold several unproduced screenplays before writing a short story about the death of his dachshund, Lily, to cope with his grief. Rowley's boyfriend encouraged him to expand it into a novel. Rowley wrote Lily and the Octopus in 100 days and submitted it to approximately 30 literary agents, who all declined to represent him. Rowley said of the manuscript, \\"I was proud of it as a piece of writing, but I never thought that this was going to change my life.\\" Intending to self-publish, Rowley hired freelance editor Molly Pisani, who later pitched the novel to her former colleague, Karyn Marcus of Simon & Schuster. Impressed by the quality of the book, Marcus forwarded it to Simon & Schuster editor-in-chief Marysue Rucci. According to Marcus: In April 2015, Publishers Weekly reported that Marcus had acquired the novel for Simon & Schuster in a \\"nearly seven-figure\\" book deal. The Hollywood Reporter noted that the offer \\"was made with unusual speed\\", with The New York Observer calling it \\"a timeline unheard of in the slow-paced publishing industry\\". Publication Lily and the Octopus was published on June 7, 2016. Reception Booklist praised Lily and the Octopus as \\"an exceedingly authentic, keenly insightful, and heartbreakingly poignant tribute to the purity of love between a pet and its human\\". Publishers Weekly called the novel \\"sensitive, hilarious, and emotionally rewarding\\", adding that \\"in generous helpings of bittersweet humanity, Rowley has written an immensely poignant and touchingly relatable tale\\". Kirkus Reviews wrote, \\"In his funny, ardent, and stanchly kooky way, Rowley expresses exactly what it's like to love a dog.\\" Sara Gruen called Lily and the Octopus \\"A quirky and deeply affecting charmer of a novel [that] is funny, wise, and utterly original in its exploration of what it means to love any mortal creature.\\" Julie Klam of The Washington Post described the novel as \\"heart-wrenching but ultimately breathtaking\\", and Garth Stein praised it as \\"a profound exploration of grief\\". In June 2016, Lily and the Octopus made the American Booksellers Association's IndieBound Bestseller List. The Washington Post put the novel on its list of \\"Notable Fiction in 2016\\".

As the uterus returns to its nonpregnant size, its muscles contract strongly, which can cause pain. Fundal massage can be performed with one hand over the pubic bone, firmly massaging the uterine fundus (the top of the uterus), or with the addition of one hand in the vagina compressing the two uterine arteries. Routine use of fundal massage can prevent postpartum or post- abortion hemorrhage and can reduce pain; it may also reduce the need for uterotonics, medications that cause the uterus to contract. It is used to treat uterine atony, a condition where the uterus lacks muscle tone and is soft to the touch instead of firm.

In 1791 he joined an infantry regiment and spent several years in Corsica. Transferred to the Army of Italy in 1799, he became an aide-de-camp to Louis-Gabriel Suchet. He fought at Pozzolo in 1800. He became aide-de-camp to Marshal Nicolas Soult in 1805 and was at Austerlitz and Jena where his actions earned a promotion to general of brigade. From 1808 he functioned as Soult's chief of staff during the Peninsular War, serving at Corunna, Braga, First and Second Porto. During this time he sent a letter to Soult's generals asking them if the marshal should assume royal powers in Northern Portugal. When he found out, Napoleon was furious and he sidelined Ricard for two years. In 1811 Soult got Ricard reinstated and he fought at Tarragona. He participated in the 1812 French invasion of Russia, was promoted general of division and fought at Krasnoi. In 1813 he led a division in the III Corps at L√ºtzen, Bautzen, Leipzig and Hanau, briefly leading the corps that winter. In 1814 he led a VI Corps division at La Rothi√®re, Champaubert, Montmirail, Vauchamps, Gu√©-√†-Tresmes, Laon, Reims, F√®re-Champenoise and Paris. During the Hundred Days he went into exile with Louis XVIII, after which he was made a count by the restored king. He led troops in the 1823 French invasion of Spain. His surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 26. Early career Ricard was born on 31 December 1771 in Castres, France in what later became the Tarn department. In 1791 he joined the French Royal Army as a sous-lieutenant in the Le F√®re Infantry Regiment. Within a year he was promoted to captain. He was soon transferred to Corsica for several years. In 1799 he emerged as an aide-de-camp to Louis-Gabriel Suchet. That year Suchet was made chief of staff to Andr√© Mass√©na in June and soon after chief of staff of the French Army of Italy under Barth√©lemy Catherine Joubert. When Joubert was killed at the Battle of Novi, Suchet was at his side. Suchet continued as chief of staff under Jean √âtienne Championnet who lost the Battle of Genola on 4 November. Championnet fell ill and died of fever on 9 January 1800. Ricard's promotion to Adjutant General Chef de brigade came through on 31 December 1799. Ricard fought at the Battle of Pozzolo in December 1800. After the war ended, he was given assignments in the 12th Military Division. Later he served at the Camp of Bruges before going to the Camp of Saint-Omer in 1803. Under Soult In 1805 Ricard became aide-de- camp to Marshal Nicolas Soult and participated in the campaigns of the War of the Third Coalition. In 1806 his noteworthy actions at the Battle of Jena in October earned him an elevation in rank to general of brigade. The promotion came on 13 November 1806. This was followed by being awarded the Commander's Cross of the L√©gion d'Honneur on 7 July 1807 and being named a Baron of the Empire on 7 June 1808. When Soult was sent to Spain to take command of the II Corps, Ricard was his chief of staff. After his long pursuit of a British army across northwest Spain, Soult was defeated at the Battle of Corunna on 16 January 1809. After the Royal Navy evacuated the British army, Napoleon ordered Soult to invade northern Portugal and the marshal began his march south on 4 March. In the Battle of Braga on 20 March, the French routed a large but poorly armed body of Portuguese militia, inflicting severe losses. On 29 March, Soult's corps attacked the Portuguese defenders in the First Battle of Porto and the slaughter was even worse. The French easily broke through the Portuguese defenses and 7,000‚Äì8,000 Portuguese were killed or drowned in the massacre and stampede that followed. Before Braga, the French captured Chaves, where Soult proclaimed himself the viceroy of Portugal. Historian Charles Oman believed there was ample evidence that Soult's ambitions included crowning himself King of Northern Portugal. Since Napoleon appointed Marshal Joachim Murat the King of Naples in 1808, it did not seem so far fetched that a French general could become a monarch. There was a small pro-French faction which would have supported Soult's royal claim and the marshal did his best to curry favor with the local Portuguese leaders. In Oporto posters were put up on the walls declaring that Soult should be appointed king. One witness claimed that, for a week, Ricard threw coins to the crowds from the balcony of Soult's headquarters as they shouted, \\"Long live King Nicolas\\". On 19 April 1809, Soult directed Ricard to send a circular letter to his generals of brigades and divisions that encouraged them to cooperate with the program of making the marshal a king. The letter was careful to note that there would be no disloyalty to Napoleon if the movement was a success. The proceedings were interrupted when Arthur Wellesley, later known as Wellington appeared with a British army. On 12 May, Wellesley's army defeated Soult in the Second Battle of Porto and drove the French out of the city. After a week-long retreat that included two hair-raising escapes, Soult's corps avoided destruction, though it lost 5,700 men killed or captured. When Napoleon received a copy of Ricard's letter, he became enraged and wrote to Soult, harshly rebuking the marshal. The angry emperor pointed out that Soult had no right to assume royal powers without his permission. Napoleon ended by favorably recalling Soult's past battlefield performance, \\"I remember nothing but Austerlitz\\". Ricard did not get off so easily and was recalled from Spain in disgrace. 1811‚Äì1812 Ricard went into semi- retirement at Villefranche-de-Rouergue. He was restored to favor when Soult asked for his services in 1811. He returned to Spain where he fought under Suchet's command at the Siege of Tarragona. In the French invasion of Russia he served as a brigade commander in Charles Louis Dieudonn√© Grandjean's 7th Infantry Division which was part of Jacques MacDonald's X Corps. Beginning on 24 July 1812, MacDonald's command operated against Riga in the north. Ricard's brigade included two battalions of the 13th Bavarian Regiment and four battalions of the 5th Polish Regiment. His troops occupied the Russian camp of D√ºnaburg in August. He was promoted general of division on 10 September 1812. Two months later he assumed command of the 2nd Infantry Division in I Corps and led the troops at the Battle of Krasnoi where he was wounded. This action was fought on 14‚Äì18 November. 1813 Ricard fought under Marshal Ney in 1813. For the 1813 spring campaign, Ricard took command of the 11th Infantry Division in Marshal Michel Ney's III Corps. The 1st Brigade consisted of the 3rd and 4th Battalions of the 9th Light Infantry and two battalions each of the 17th and 18th Provisional Regiments. The 2nd brigade was made up of four battalions each of the 142nd and 144th Line Infantry. There were 7,608 infantrymen, 175 gunners, 152 sappers and 305 wagon drivers. Both attached foot artillery companies were armed with six 6-pounders and two 5¬Ω-inch howitzers. In the Battle of L√ºtzen on 2 May 1813 the Russo-Prussian army achieved surprise when it attacked the III Corps. Joseph Souham's 8th and Jean-Baptiste Girard's 10th Divisions absorbed the force of the initial assault. Girard's artillery was not immediately available so the guns of Antoine Fran√ßois Brenier de Montmorand's 9th Division and Ricard's division were utilized in support. Savage fighting revolved around four villages which were repeatedly taken and retaken. Ricard's troops recaptured the village of Kaja in the afternoon. In the Battle of Bautzen on 21 May 1813, the III Corps was ordered to envelop the Russo-Prussian right wing. The maneuver almost succeeded when Souham's division seized the key village of Preititz at 11:00 am, but then lost it to Allied counterattacks. At this time, Ney faltered, ordering his divisions to halt. Three divisions, including Ricard's, recaptured Preititz at 3:00 pm. By this time, the Allied right wing succeeded in escaping Napoleon's intended trap. Between 25 April and 31 May, the III Corps dwindled from 49,189 men to 24,581 men due to combat losses and sickness. Though part of the III Corps was at the Battle of Katzbach on 26 August, Ricard's division was not engaged. Ricard's division fought at the Battle of Leipzig on 16‚Äì19 October 1813 with a strength of 4,357 men and 12 guns. On the 16th, Napoleon intended for the III Corps, now led by Souham, to aid his attack to the south of Leipzig. However, when fighting unexpectedly broke out to the north of the city, Ney held the corps back then later changed his mind. Consequently, Napoleon launched his main assault without III Corps, and it was only in the evening that Ricard's division belatedly intervened on the southern front. The division participated in the Battle of Hanau on 30‚Äì31 October. Subsequently, Napoleon's wrecked army retreated across the Rhine River. The III Corps, now led by Ricard, was at H√∂chst on 1 November. Crossing the Rhine on 3 November, the III Corps took position at Bechtheim. 1814 Battle of Vauchamps, 14 February 1814 On 30 December 1813, Ricard commanded the 3,000-man 1st Division in Marshal Auguste Marmont's VI Corps. That day his troops left Koblenz and moved south, to be replaced by Pierre Fran√ßois Joseph Durutte's division. During this transfer, the Allies launched a successful crossing of the Rhine on 1 January 1814 and threatened to capture the isolated French. By hard marching, Ricard and Durutte managed to elude the Allies and reach Saarbr√ºcken. On 14 January, believing he was about to be surrounded, Ricard evacuated Pont-√†-Mousson without orders. His worst mistake was not destroying the bridge over the Moselle River. The French forces withdrew toward the Meuse River. On 19 January Ricard's rear guard ambushed some Prussian cavalry in a brisk skirmish at Manheulles. When Napoleon arrived at the front on 26 January 1814, Marmont's 12,051-man command included Jean- Pierre Doumerc's I Cavalry Corps and the VI Corps with the divisions of Ricard and Joseph Lagrange. Hoping to surprise Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher's army, Napoleon launched an advance in three columns. The right column led by √âtienne Maurice G√©rard consisted of the divisions of Ricard and Georges Joseph Dufour. Marmont guarded the army's rear with Lagrange's division. On 1 February the Allies with 120,000 troops defeated Napoleon with 45,000 at the Battle of La Rothi√®re. Only 85,000 Allies came into action. G√©rard's ad hoc corps held Dienville on the right flank with 8,300 men. Their opponents were the Austrian III Corps under Ignaz Gyulai with one division on the west bank of the Aube River and the brigade of Franz Spl√©ny de Milh√°ldy on the east bank. The west bank division briefly captured Dienville's bridge before being thrown back. The Austrians only took Dienville at midnight after G√©rard abandoned the village. Both sides suffered about 6,000 casualties in the battle, but Napoleon lost 60 field pieces and was forced to retreat. A battle map showed Dufour in the first line and Ricard in the second line. A Russian attempt to cut off the French retreat the next day was blocked by Emmanuel Grouchy's cavalry and Ricard at Piney. Napoleon with 30,000 troops pounced on Bl√ºcher's widely separated army in the Six Days' Campaign. On 10 February, the French attacked Nicolay Dmitrevich Olssufiev's 4,000 Russian infantry and 24 guns. Stung by recent criticism, Olssufiev unwisely stood his ground against overwhelming odds in the Battle of Champaubert. About 11:00 am Marmont's corps began the assault with the divisions of Ricard on the right against Baye and Lagrange on the left against Bannay. Despite stout resistance, the villages were seized by 3:00 pm and French cavalry was advancing on both flanks. Belatedly Olssufiev ordered a retreat but 1,000 men and nine guns were surrounded at Champaubert and forced to surrender. At most, 1,700 Russians escaped through the woods east to √âtoges and Olssufiev became a French prisoner. There were 38,000 Allies under Fabian Wilhelm von Osten-Sacken and Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg to the west and Bl√ºcher's 19,000 to the east. In the Campaign of 1814, Ricard fought at La Rothi√®re, Champaubert, Montmirail, Vauchamps, Gu√©-√†-Tresmes (just north of Meaux), Laon, Reims, F√®re-Champenoise and Paris. In the Battle of Montmirail on 11 February, Napoleon moved against Sacken's 18,000 Russians and 90 guns west of Montmirail with Ricard's division and some cavalry. After being driven out of Marchais at 11:00 am, Ricard's division was ordered to recapture the village. After a furious struggle that raged until 2:00 pm, Marchais remained in Russian hands. By this time Ney's corps arrived to put more pressure on the Russians. The French finally captured Marchais and most of its defenders were cut down by French cavalry as they fled. Escaping to the north with difficulty, Sacken lost 2,800 men, six colors and 13 guns while Yorck's Prussians sustained 900 casualties. The French lost 2,000 killed and wounded. At Montmirail Ricard's division consisted of the one battalion each of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 9th and 16th Light Infantry and the 22nd, 40th, 50th, 65th, 136th, 138th, 142nd, 144th and 145th Line Infantry. Ricard missed the Battle of Ch√¢teau-Thierry on the 12th. The Battle of Vauchamps was fought on 14 February 1814 between Napoleon and Bl√ºcher. As Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten's 5,700-strong Prussian vanguard emerged from Vauchamps, it found it was facing Marmont's 5,000-man corps. By this time, Ricard's division had shrunk to a strength of 800 men. Nevertheless, Marmont ordered it forward and Ricard's men were driven back. When the Prussians pursued, they were met by Lagrange's infantry in front and Grouchy's cavalry charging in from the right. Zieten's division was nearly destroyed with very heavy losses. By the end of the day Napoleon had badly beaten Bl√ºcher who lost 4,000 Prussians, 2,000 Russians and 16 guns. The French counted only 600 casualties. Ricard's next action was the Battle of Gu√©-√†-Tresmes on 28 February 1814 in which the French defeated Friedrich Graf Kleist von Nollendorf's Prussian II Corps. The 14,500 French under Marmont inflicted 1,035 casualties on the 12,000 Prussians while sustaining losses of 250. At this time Ricard's division numbered 790 light and 2,000 line infantry. The Battle of Laon was fought on 9‚Äì10 March and resulted in Napoleon's defeat. On the evening of the 9th, Marmont's corps was surprised by the Prussians and routed, suffering a loss of 3,500 casualties, 45 guns and most of its wagons. Napoleon mauled an Allied corps in the Battle of Reims on 13 March, capturing 22 field pieces. Casualties numbered 900 French, 1,400 Russians and 1,300 Prussians. The Russian commander Emmanuel de Saint-Priest with 14,500 men did not know Napoleon was present with 20,000 troops and took up a bad position outside Reims. The French attack was led by two cavalry divisions followed by Ricard's infantry. Saint-Priest was fatally wounded by a cannon shot and his troops chased from the city. In the Battle of F√®re- Champenoise on 25 March 1814, Marmont and √âdouard Mortier, duc de Tr√©vise with 17,000 foot, 4,000 horse and 84 guns were defeated by 28,000 Allies, most of whom were cavalry, and 80 guns. The French cavalry were overwhelmed, leaving the infantry to be hustled from Soud√© to F√®re-Champenoise by the Allied horsemen. French losses numbered 2,000 killed and wounded plus 4,000 men, 45 guns and 100 caissons captured. The Battle of Paris was fought on 30 March by which time Ricard's division numbered only 726 men. The 107,000 Allies defeated the 42,000 French defenders who abandoned the capital that evening. In consequence, Napoleon abdicated his throne on 6 April. Later career Under King Louis XVIII, Ricard was awarded the knight's cross of the Order of Saint Louis and given command of the 10th Military District at Toulouse. In 1815 he was sent to the Congress of Vienna to convince the Allies that France's army was loyal to Louis XVIII. This mission was rendered moot when Napoleon overthrew the Bourbons during the Hundred Days and Ricard traveled to Ghent to join the king in exile. In 1817 Ricard was ennobled as a count. In the 1823 French invasion of Spain he served as a division commander in Jacques Lauriston's corps. He led the Royal Guard infantry division from 1829 to 1831, when he retired from the army. He died on 6 November 1843 at Recoules, Aveyron, France. RICARD is inscribed on the south side of the Arc de Triomphe.

In its day, it was one of the most complete and modern lumber mills on the Mississippi River, employing about 400 men during the working season, and between 200 and 300 men in the logging end of the business. History The Musser Lumber Company of Muscatine, Iowa, was incorporated in February, 1881, with a capital stock of $200,000. Peter Musser was elected president; Richard Musser, vice-president; P. M. Musser, secretary and treasurer; and C. R. Fox, yard and planing mill superintendent. This company was an outgrowth of the pioneer lumber firm of R. Musser & Company, which was established by Peter and Richard Musser and Edward Hoch in 1855. These gentlemen began by buying rafts of lumber in the river, which they yarded and sold by retail and Wholesale. They also established a lumber yard at Iowa City in 1856, where Peter Musser resided, it being managed by that gentleman until he went to California, in April, 1864. Hoch continued in the firm for three years until 1858, when he retired, and the firm became R. Musser & Company. In 1864, P. M. Musser bought into the business, without any change of firm name; he assumed charge of the Iowa City yard, which he conducted until 1873, when he and John Porter purchased the interest of R. Musser & Company in the branch yard at Iowa City. They carried on under the firm name of Musser & Porter, with P. M. Musser still retaining his interest in the business in Muscatine. In 1870, having returned from California, Peter Musser joined his brother, Richard, together with C. R. Fox, a former employee, and P. M. Musser, in the organization of the firm of Musser & Company for the purpose of building and operating a saw mill and carrying on the lumber business at Muscatine. In the spring of 1871, they completed their mill at a point on the Mississippi River, since known as Musserville, which was included in the corporate limits of the city of Muscatine, and began the manufacture of lumber. The mill cut about of lumber a year. In 1873, Richard Musser retired from the business, selling his interest to P. M. Musser, and the firm became P. M. Musser & Company. Three years later, Richard Musser renewed his connection with the company, and the firm name of Musser & Company was again adopted. In 1877, the company enlarged their mill, putting in improved machinery and increasing its capacity materially. Four years later, the proprietors decided to organize under an act of incorporation, which was done in February, 1881, under the name of the Musser Lumber Company, the incorporators being the original proprietors, R. Musser, P. Musser, P. M. Musser and C. R. Fox of Muscatine, and John Musser of Adamstown, Pennsylvania, and the officers elected being the same as given above. During the same year, the company rebuilt and enlarged the mill, which they fitted with the most modern and improved machinery, making it one of the most complete and capacious saw mills on the Mississippi River, with capacity for manufacturing of lumber, of lath and of shingles for the working season. The power was furnished by two engines, the combined force of which equaled 500 horse-power. In 1882, the company erected a planing mill, detached from the saw mill, which afforded facilities for dressing lumber and the manufacture of flooring, siding and boards. The business of this company was strictly wholesale, and their trade was principally located in the states of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Colorado and Dakota. The number of people employed at their mills and yards was about 300. The Musser Lumber Company owned large tracts of pine lands along the Chippewa in Wisconsin and in the Minnesota lumber region; their logs were cut by contract and were rafted by the Chippewa Logging Company and the Mississippi River Logging Company, two large lumber corporations, of which the Musser Lumber Company was one of the incorporators,. For about 12 years, this company owned and operated its own rafting steamers, it having operated the ‚ÄúSilver Wave‚Äù and ‚ÄúLe Clare Belle\\" during all that time, and the steamer, ‚ÄúMusser,‚Äù for two years. All were sold during the season of 1888 to Capt. S. R. Van Sant. The company‚Äôs plant covered an area of thirty-five acres, and the yards were stocked according to the season of the year, in the amount of of lumber and a proportionate amount of lath and shingles. To convey an idea of the growth of the business from the date of its origin with the firm of Hoeh & Musser, it was reported that the amount of business done the first year was about US$100,000, while the 1898 annual business of the company exceeded $750,000. This corporation had its own system of water-works, which was established in 1872, and in which a Duplex pump and Cameron pump, was used. This company also had one of Barry‚Äôs Niagara rotary hydrants, which could throw a three-inch stream a distance of about and to a height of , and thus the supply of water and force was equal to emergencies which might arise. The Mussers were also the original incorporators of the Mississippi River Logging Company and Chippewa Lumber and Boom Company; they were also largely interested in the Musser-Sauntry Land, Logging and Manufacturing Company of Stillwater, Minnesota, among the largest pine land owners and logging companies in the world. The aggregate cut of the mills at Muscatine was reported in 1875 at 38,000,000 feet, with 21,000,000 shingles; that of 1880 at 55,000,000 feet, with 18,000,000 shingles, while that of 1897 reached 110,000,000 feet of lumber, 30,000,000 shingles and 25,000,000 lath. The Musser Lumber Company, one of Iowa's pioneer lumber concerns, closed up its business at Muscatine on November 28, 1916. Following a meeting of the directors of the lumber concern, it was decided to dissolve the company and formal announcement of the dissolution was made on that date by P. M. Musser, president and treasurer. The officers of the company up to the time of the dissolution were: P. M. Musser, president and treasurer; William Musser, vice-president, and R. Drew Musser, secretary.

Kangra tea is a tea from the Kangra district in Himachal Pradesh, India. Both black tea and green tea have been produced in the Kangra Valley since the mid-19th century. Kangra tea was given the Geographical Indication status in 2005. History Tea was first grown in the Kangra region in the mid-19th century. After a feasibility survey in 1848 showed the area of being suitable for tea plantation, a Chinese variety of Camellia sinensis was planted across the region. The production turned out to be successful in Palampur and Dharamshala, despite failing in other locations. By the 1880s, the Kangra tea was considered to be superior to tea from other places, and was bought in Kabul and Central Asia. In 1882, the Kangra District Gazette described Kangra tea as \\"superior to that produced in any other part of India.\\" In 1886 and 1895, the tea received gold and silver medals at International conventions held in London and Amsterdam. Locals and tourists alike take walks through a tea estate in Dharamsala. However, the 1905 Kangra earthquake caused thousands of deaths and destruction of factories, forcing the British to sell the plantations and leave the area. In the decades that followed, only small quantities of Kangra tea were produced by the new owners. After a further decline of produce in the 21st century, research and techniques are being promoted, aimed at reviving the brand by increasing the produce. In 2012, the then Union Minister for Commerce & Industry, Anand Sharma, laid the foundation stone for the Palampur regional office of the Tea Board of India, marking a significant step towards the re-integration of the Kangra region into the mainstream of the Indian tea industry. Description Although Kangra cultivates both black tea and green tea, black tea constitutes around 90 percent of the production. As of May 2015, there are 5,900 tea gardens in the area covering about 2,312 hectares of land between Dharamsala, Shahpur, Palampur, Baijnath and Jogindernagar; with an annual output of 8.99 lakh kg. Mann Tea Estate, owned by Dharmsala Tea Company, located in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, about half an hour from McLeodganj. Kangra tea is known for its unique color and flavor. The unique characteristics of the tea is attributed to the geographical properties of the region. It was granted the Geographical Indication tag in 2005 by Office of the Controller-General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks, Chennai, as per Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999. Flavour is indeed the unique selling proposition of Kangra tea. The Chinese hybrid variety grown here produces a very pale liquor, which is the reason why Kangra does not produce any CTC (crushed, turned, curled) tea‚Äîthe staple tea of India. Tea tourism Towa Tea Estate, owned by Dharmsala Tea Company, lies at an altitude of over 6,500 ft. Tea tourism is slowly beginning to gain ground in and around Kangra. Several of the tea estates and tea factories in Palampur and Dharamsala offer factory tours as well as home stays for those interested in learning more about the tea. The Dharmsala Tea Company offers guided tours of its factory and tea gardens, starting from its factory in Mann Tea Estate. Similarly, the Palampur Cooperative Tea Factory offers factory tours and homestays.

It is a small corridor between Lahaul's Chandra Valley and the Kullu valley of Himachal Pradesh, India. The nomenclature of the trek was derived from Hamta Village, located below Sethan village, as part of the trek route. This pass is frequently used by shepherds of the lower Himalayan region, seeking high altitude grasslands in the summer, when the dry cold desert of Lahaul is barren.  About the Hamta Pass trek  Numbers of wildflowers and herbs grow at the altitude between 3000 meters to 3800 meters. Vertical rock walls, waterfalls, hanging glaciers, pinewoods, rhododendron forests, open meadows, tiny lakes and peaks rising above 6000 metres are the main characteristics of this trek. The trek begins in the green Kullu valley and crosses over, through Hamta Pass, into the drier region of Lahaul. The trek takes climbers over glaciers, fast-flowing rivers, and challenging terrain, but is nevertheless regarded as suitable for fit beginners. Beyond Hamta Pass, trekkers can choose to extend their trek towards the beautiful Chandrataal lake.Lonely PlanetNational Geographic Traveller India The nearest hub is Manali, in Himachal Pradesh. Most itineraries include transport from Manali to Jobri, from where the trek begins. Depending on the trek itinerary, it takes 3‚Äì4 days to complete the trek.

The episode was watched by 6.53 million viewers and received positive reviews. Critics praised the Red Hood gang and Bruce's storyline. Plot The Red Hood Gang are thugs, commit a bank heist, and the bank guard shoots at one of them; all miss their mark. Gus Floyd (Michael Goldsmith) wants the public crowd to swarm as a distraction for the arriving police so he tosses part of the loot. Police investigators Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) review bank surveillence footage. They speculate that there was a test staged of police response time with a smoke bomb and where they could be found since one of the gang wore a Kleg's Auto shop uniform. The gang reconnoiters for the shop and Floyd says that whoever wears the red mask should lead the gang. Gang member Clyde Destro (Jonny Coyne) kills Floyd and takes the mask as a prize. Gordon and Bullock discover in a refrigerator at the shop Floyd's corpse. Destro is identified by a witness, and Gordon and Bullock use his release as a ploy to trail him to the gang. Destro is wounded by a member of the gang, and the red mask is taken as a prize. Gordon and Bullock find Destro who turns on the gang and reveals all about them. The GCPD get into a shootout and all the gang are killed. Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) is brought to an office manager (Jeffrey Combs). He says he is not the official owner of the prison as the real doctor, \\"Dulmacher\\", is away in Gotham. When he tells her that her eyes would be of high value and tries to extract one, she removes her eye herself with a spoon and steps onto it, making it now worthless. In Wayne Manor, Alfred (Sean Pertwee) receives the visit from an old SAS friend Reggie Payne (David O'Hara), who had been arrested for sleeping in the streets. Bruce (David Mazouz) lets him stay a few days. However, at night, Payne steals some files from Wayne Enterprises and Bruce's notes. Alfred finds him and while they argue, Payne stabs him and flees. Bruce takes Alfred to the hospital. Payne later gives the information to the Wayne Enterprises Board, for which he receives a payment. In the streets, a boy finds the red mask and upon wearing it, he mimics shooting at the police. Reception=Viewers= The episode was watched by 6.53 million viewers, with a 2.3 rating among 18-49 adults. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 9.73 million viewers, and a 3.6 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Critical reviews= \\"Red Hood\\" received positive reviews. The episode received a rating of 77% with an average score of 7.4 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: \\"With 'Red Hood,' Gotham finds its footing as a breeding ground for supervillainy, crusaders, and risk, unafraid to throw in a walloping surprise of grotesque proportions that couldn't be seen coming.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.4 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"Even though the Red Hood gang story will only pay dividends in our minds, it felt more like a fun, harmless one-off rather than a big, heavy 'this is where it all begins' ground zero moment. And I liked that. Also working this week was the visit Alfred and Bruce got from Reggie Payne, as it helped shade in Alfred's past and raise up Wayne Industries as a corporate villain. Fish and Penguin however continued to flounder in stories that, respectively, don't tonally line up and seek to undo established character traits from earlier in the season.\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"For perhaps the first time this season, Gotham actually feels like a show that's about the city, and how that city might come to produce not only hardened supervillains, but also a caped vigilante. There are two central storylines that drive the episode, and they share thematic territory. In one storyline, Bullock and Gordon investigate a series of bank robberies executed by the newly-named Red Hood Gang. In another, an old Secret Service buddy of Alfred's tracks him down in the hopes of getting his life back on track. The storylines aren't connected on the surface, but both serves to deepen our understanding of Gotham and the central characters. They both speak to issues of identity, power, and corruption in a meaningful, subtle way, something that the show hasn‚Äôt been able to pull off so far this season.\\" References External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 1) episodes Category:2015 American television episodes Category:Red Hood ","title":"Red Hood (Gotham)"},{"id":"49225005","text":"Gender-responsive prisons (also known as gender-responsive corrections or gender-responsive programming) are prisons constructed to provide gender- specific care to incarcerated women. Contemporary sex-based prison programs were presented as a solution to the rapidly increasing number of women in the prison industrial complex and the overcrowding of California's prisons. These programs vary in intent and implementation and are based on the idea that female offenders differ from their male counterparts in their personal histories and pathways to crime. Multi-dimensional programs oriented toward female behaviors are considered by many to be effective in curbing recidivism.  History  The 19th century was important because instead of relying on corporal methods of punishment, incarceration was seen as the main tool of punishment. In the United States, authorities began housing women in correctional facilities separate from men in the 1870s. The first American female correctional facility with dedicated buildings and staff was the Mount Pleasant Female Prison in Ossining, New York; the facility had some operational dependence on nearby Sing Sing, a men's prison. Unlike prisons designed for men in the United States, state prisons for women evolved in three waves. First, women prisoners were imprisoned alongside men in \\"general population,\\" where they were subject to sexual attacks and daily forms of degradation. In an attempt to address these issues, women prisoners were removed from general population and housed separately, wherein they did not receive the same resources as men in prisons. In the third stage of development, women in prison were then housed completely separately in fortress-like prisons, where the goal of punishment was to indoctrinate women into traditional feminine roles. The history of the contemporary gender- responsiveness movement can be traced back to a selection of works written by Barbara Bloom and Stephanie Covington in the early 2000s. Their case for, and articulation of gender-responsiveness, forms the theoretical backbone from which many others develop theories and/or criticisms of gender-responsive prisons. Many of the suggestions and implementation strategies forwarded in these texts were integral in constructing what we think of today as gender- responsive prisons. Effect on youth Gender-responsive prisons also deal with children in detention centers. According to research conducted between 1991 and 2003, the percent of girls being put in detention centers has increased by 98%. Advocates for gender-response detention centers use statistics as a form of backing. Research has also presented 35% of girls in detention centers have experience with sexual abuse and 40% have been involved in cases involving domestic abuse. A study conducted in 2015 analyzed the different effects that gender-responsive programming has on boys and girls. In the findings, it was shown that gender-responsive programming works for young girls with a history of emotional trauma or mental issues. Their needs are met more closely as a sense of trust within the prison community is built. Within gender-responsive programs, abused girls are given the chance to talk about challenges and safety issues, while they are promoting self-cultivation and accepting personal responsibility. However, for young girls that do not have these issues, rather they are more influenced by general factors, research shows that behavioral reinforcement programming or traditional based programming are better methods in preventing recidivism. Gender-responsive programming does not appear to reduce the overall rate of boys re-entering the juvenile facilities upon release because gender-responsive programming fails to consider the unique, gendered issues of young boys.  Assessment  The two most popular approaches to understanding the needs of female offenders are known as the pathways perspective and the gender-responsive perspective. Gender-responsive prisons provide sociocultural and therapeutic interventions through treatment and skill building within the criminal justice system. The pathways theory has been evaluated as the unique circumstances that women are involved with, differing from those related to male offenders because of their gender, race, and class that result in criminal activity. Although it has been reviewed as a series of generalizations and criticized for its dismissal of the complex and heterogeneous circumstances that influence female offenders, Kristy Holtfreter and Katelyn Wattanaporn describe the pathways approach has been widely adopted in the field of criminology and prison reform. The pathways approach to gender-responsive treatment has been criticized by others in the field of criminology and prison reform, because it classifies female offenders as either victims of trauma, [physical and substance] abuse or mental illness; or as caretakers, mothers, and wives. It is hypothesized that a multi-dimensional program oriented towards female behaviors is crucial for rehabilitation and a general improvement of all criminal justice phases. As part of this hypothesis, there are six 'guiding principles' that are fundamental for effective gender-responsive services. They are as follows: (1) acknowledge that gender makes a difference; (2) create an environment based on safety, dignity and respect; (3) address substance abuse, trauma and mental health issues through comprehensive, integrated, and culturally relevant services and appropriate supervision; (4) develop policies, practices and programs that are relational and promote healthy connections to children, family and significant others; (5) provide women with opportunities to improve their socio-economic conditions; (6) establish a system of community supervision and re-entry with comprehensive, collaborative services.\\" A 2012 study was conducted to understand the experiences of a new cognitive skills program that compares and contrasts a gender-responsive approach with a gender-neutral approach. The study involved a focus group of males and females that measured cognitive skills such as impulsivity, decision-making, interpersonal problem-solving, and influence in others. It concluded that participants were most receptive to gender-specific programs and evaluated the quality of current intervention and rehabilitation programs and whether they catered to their needs. Another study conducted in 2010 focuses on gender- responsive programs for the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment (RSAT) program in a women's correctional facility in Michigan. Data was gathered to determine how the program aids substance abusers can break their cycle with the rehabilitation program that utilizes philosophy catered to women in an effort to address the differences in perspective and process the emotional and mental information. A 2008 study focuses on the need for gender-responsive programming, but acknowledges the lack of research regarding the outcome of implementing gender-responsive prisons. The study is trying to understand whether gender-responsive needs contribute to poor prison adjustment and community recidivism. Data included the observation of women's needs that are being neglected within the prison complex. =Reproductive oppression= Reproductive oppression, in the context of the carceral state, is a form of gendered violence that refers to the intentional imprisonment of women during their reproductive years, neglectful healthcare, and coerced or non-consensual sterilization procedures. Gender-Responsive prisons in part were created as a response to the mistreatment experienced by women who suffered from reproductive oppression. Policy-makers and reformists argued on behalf of gender-responsive prisons by asserting that they are better able to consider the specific health needs of women. However, critics of gender-responsive prisons have claimed that regardless of how reformed a prison is, the very nature of incarceration during one's reproductive years can be considered a form of reproductive oppression. Critics also note that increased punitive policies that criminalize both perpetrators and victims of violence against women have not only increased the number of women but the frequency of reproductive oppression. Women are more likely than men to experience parental terminations, poverty, and substance addiction, and they tend to support the notion that incarcerated women value relationships, especially familial and parental bonds. Gender-responsive prisons advocate for gender-responsive treatment that allows for women to communicate relational issues, giving them the opportunity to mend broken relationships and decrease incidents of misconduct in prison.  Opposition  Limitations to the current criminal justice system have set precedence to how marginalized individuals are criminalized and unable to receive proper treatment within the prisons and outside prison walls. One criticism of the gender responsiveness model, is that it simply replaces the male prison norms it seeks to escape with female norms by categorizing and homogenizing women's experiences. = Intersectionality = Kimberl√© Crenshaw, a well-known scholar who coined the phrase intersectionality, states her findings on racialized gender violence and anti-Black racism in the carceral state in her 2012 article, From Private Violence to Mass Incarceration. The current framework of mass incarceration ignores the spatial fluidity of its own persistent nature and the industrialized commodification of marginalized people. Not only that, Crenshaw also explicates the lack of intersectional lens of the framing of incarceration in regards to racialized gender and gendered race in that the dominant frame is male-focused while the focus of gender-responsive approaches to address the needs of explicit gender differences often neglects the racialized realities of particular marginalized women. While gender-responsive prisons purport to be response to the unique needs of women, often the \\"woman\\" whose needs are in question is imagined as white, straight, and middle class. In reality, the racialized nature of the prison industrial complex results in relatively high incarceration rates of women of color. When the prison is understood as a site for imposing gender norms, it is easy to imagine it as a site of imposed gender conformity and heteronormativity, white supremacy, and xenophobia on women who do not fit into this paradigm. Thus, theory of intersectionality in prison reform highlights the need to become aware of and accommodating to the experiences of oppressed individuals rather than create a punitive system of disproportionate structural disadvantage. Despite the inclusion of women in correctional facilities, there has been little focus on the impact of the carceral system intergenerationally through family and loved ones, particularly on women. Incarcerating women is not a trauma solitarily felt; oftentimes these women are mothers, separated from their families. The physical, emotional, and mental separation enacts an intergenerational trauma known as natal alienation, which serves to interrupt the stability of families and their reproduction. This interrupted history, and internalized belief that their families are not worth maintaining contributes to the social death of the individual. While gender-responsive prisons claim to have motherhood programs, their very existence is a weapon against the motherhood of the women of color it targets. = Queer and trans politics = Gender-responsive prisons become especially problematic for those incarcerated people who present as gender non-conforming or transgender. Trans and queer people, especially those of color or those from low-income backgrounds, are directly targeted for imprisonment. This may partly be due to the criminalization of people who do not conform to norms of white heteropatriarchy. Another potential explanation is, because queer, trans, and gender non-conforming people face stigmatization, they are more likely to experience discrimination and violence that places them proximate to illicit activity and poverty. Problems may arise when determining in what gender prison to place the individual. Once placed, that person may encounter traumatic experiences from strip searches by a police officer of an alternate gender, or increased rates of rape and assault. By using the gender binary to order the prison system, it the prison enacts an additional violence on non-binary people by placing them in an environment where their bodies are made hyper-visible, and thus more susceptible to violence. The discussion of queer and trans liberation politics in relation to the carceral state is important in understanding the widespread and interconnected nature of state violence on marginalized people, and presents a potential for an abolitionist framework. In discussing the relation between gender-responsive prisons and individuals who identify as gender non- conforming or transgender, research has been presented in bringing forth injustices within the prison setting. Research introduced has presented the term gender outlaws, a term in reference to individuals who do not commit to gender specific action. In the fight for Queer & Trans Politics, the Sylvia Rivera Law Project works with people regardless of their racial and gender background in ensuring a discrimination-free environment. = Penal politics = Gender-responsive (GR) penal policies allow for gendered governance where gendered punishment dictates how women should behave, targeting and governing females through the penal structure. Furthermore, GR penal policies coerce women to adhere to parenting and motherhood ideals belonging to the normative, white middle-class values. GR penal codes are also argued to be punitive rather than rehabilitative; thus, a possible solution may include collaboration between state institutions as well as the local community. = Rehabilitation = Bloom suggests that certain crimes committed by women do not merit incarceration but instead should be 'treated' with psychological assistance and therapy. In a study conducted in 2007, focusing on women in prison with alcohol problems, gender-responsive models are noted as important. Mendoza, a professor at the National Autonomous University, presents how social structures evident within gender-responsive prisons have limited the access and resources women are given in dealing with alcohol addiction. Gender-responsive treatment (GRT) calls for clinically trained workers to establish a women-focused program where the aim is to facilitate rehabilitation and prevent drug relapse. The Helping Women Recover program is organized in four modules: self module, relationship module, sexuality module, and spirituality module. Calhoun, Messina, Cartier, and Torres, members of Integrated Substance Abuse Programs (ISAP) at UCLA, discovered that incarcerated women expressed interest in learning the reasons for their drug use, specifically how their familial relationships and childhood traumas impacted their substance abuse. = Health = A constant topic in gender responsive prisons discusses the role mental has within gender responsive prisons. Studies addressing the mental health process of women have determined that at least 60% of women in state prison have disclosed going through some sort of physical or sexual abuse.Bureau of Justice Statistics.(1999). Women offenders: Special Report. Washington, DC. U.S. Department of Justice. These statistics provide a foundation for individuals in support of gender- responsive prisons in presenting that individuals are faced with different forms of abuse in the prison system. Studies have shown that women tend to use drugs as a form of self-medication for depression and anxiety, which result from traumatic childhood and adolescent experiences. Saxena and Messina, Ph.D. scholars in the Integrated Substance Abuse Programs (ISAP) at UCLA, and Christine Grella, a professor for ISAP, argue that gender-responsive treatment's (GRT) multimodal approach allows for inclusivity in which the monolithic Therapeutic Community (TC) treatment lacks. = Abolitionist approaches = Advocates of prison reform suggest that the current criminal justice system does not prevent criminal activity and is therefore broken. Abolitionists, on the other hand, argue that the system is not \\"broken,\\" but rather is working perfectly by its own logic of a system that is racist, classist, homophobic, etc. Abolitionists seek to shift discussions surrounding gender-responsive prisons toward their existence as reformist reforms. By sanitizing the appearance and rhetoric of the prison, gender-responsiveness programs allow the carceral state to achieve greater sustainability by supporting violence, criminalization, and deportation. Reforming the criminal justice system leaves unadressed systemic issues such as poverty and inaccessibility to healthcare or education. Therefore, abolitionists affirm using transformative justice to reimagine a world that does not support incarceration including surveillance, deportation and detention centers, criminalization, and violence. Abolitionists critical of gender-responsive prisons specifically contend that the use of gender-responsive prison programs propagates the myth of individual rehabilitation, and that it takes what it, in essence, structural inequality and transforms it into a problem with a prison focused solution. Abolitionist Bree Carlton expands on her criticism of gender-responsive programs in her article \\"Pathways, Race and Gender Responsive Reform: Through an Abolitionist Lens\\". She takes a four-stage approach to addressing the problem of gender-responsive programs specifically in Victoria, Australia; these four stages include: addressing the significance of the adoption of the 'pathways approach' and its use of the rehabilitation defense of prisons, discussing the constructions of race and culture in gender responsive discourses, acknowledging the disproportionate number of Vietnamese women incarcerated in Victoria and the racialized implications of the 'pathways approach,' and finally a reflection on the issue of prison reform.

In 1937, he and his brother moved to Perth to live with their Aunt and Uncle in Midland, going to school at Midland Primary. After finishing school in 1946, Digby went to Trade School. He soon became interested in technical drawing rather than Trade School and applied for a draughtsman cadetship in the public service. Twelve months too young to undertake the cadetship, he started working as a trainee junior clerk in the Forests Department until he was old enough to enter the cadet program.

The house was built in 1606 and was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency on 2 September 1994. The building complex is situated in the central Indre By neighbourhood on Fredens Torv by the Aarhus River. It is one of the oldest preserved buildings in the city with a history of many different uses. The listing includes the main building of the former manor built in 1606 and an adjacent former warehouse building from 1850.  History  The building was built in 1606 for Christence Bryske, the widow of Thomas Fasti of the Katholm Castle manor. Christence Bryske died in 1639 and the family of her brother, Karl Bryske, inherited the house. In 1663 King Christian V bought the estate in order to turn it into a granary. In the early 1700s the buildings were bought by royal surveyor of provisions Christen Wegerslev for 1040 rigsdaler. The next owner was assessor J√∏rgen Pedersen Westergaard who owned a merchant estate in Vestergade 49 and a number of small half-timbered houses in Fiskergade. In 1761 Trods Katholm was owned by Westergaard's widow and the ground floor was used as a private residence while the upper floor was used for storing grain. In 1764 manager of Aarhus County Jens Thygesen bought Trods Katholm on auction. In 1801 tax registers show the estate covers a main building 14 beams wide in two stories with 8 iron stoves. Compared to the registers of 1791 the building is 6 beams shorter and two floors lower. In 1801 a smaller outbuilding with rooms and kitchen and a number of other buildings for stables, wash rooms, scullery and servants quarters was noted. Another larger one story outbuilding 24 beams long contained various rooms, study and 7 iron stoves. In the garden there was a hexagonal brick pavilion. In the mid-1800s Trods Katholm was owned by a company owned by three men; distiller S√∏ren Thomsen, the owner of Moesg√•rd Thorkild Christian Dahl and procurator Jens Christian Hee. In 1853 Thomsen bought Trods Katholm for himself and sold off the garden on which Fredens Torv was subsequently established. Thomsen incidentally also built Stykgodspakhuset from 1847 which is also a listed building today. In 1857 Edwin Friedleif Rahr bought Trods Katholm and 40 years later his son Viggo Ludvig Rahr inherited it. In 1900 Rahr put the buildings through an extensive renovation and in 1911 he sold it to state attorney Kier who later gave it to his sons Wilhelm and Aage Kier. In 1975 the brothers sold Trods Katholm to the company Bruun & S√∏rensen. In 1988 the building was owned by an insurance company that eventually sold it off in apartment units. Trods Katholm was listed in 1994.  Architecture  Trods Katholm is an example of classical architecture with a strong symmetry. It is believed to be the first brick building south of the Aarhus River, built on the edge of the city as it was expanding towards the coast. Originally the building was both longer and taller and today only the two bottom floors are preserved.

Construction, acquisition, and commissioning Intrepid (YP-71)-a yacht built in 1929 at Neponset, Massachusetts, by George Lawley & Son, -was acquired by the Navy on 16 July 1940. She was renamed Sylph and redesignated PY-12 three days later. After conversion in New York City by the Sullivan Drydock and Repair Corporation, she was commissioned on 1 October 1940. Service history After commissioning, she remained at New York, assigned to the 3d Naval District to train reserve midshipmen. Soon after America's entry into World War II, Sylph was fitted with sound gear and depth charges and assigned to Tompkinsville, New York, to help patrol for German U-boats. On 10 February 1942, she was reassigned to New London, Connecticut, whence she continued to hunt for submarines. While at New London, Sylph also helped periodically to train sonarmen-so sorely needed in the Battle of the Atlantic. Future Hollywood actor Ernest Borgnine served as a U.S. Navy gunner's mate aboard Sylph during its antisubmarine warfare patrols of the North Atlantic. In the fall of 1943, Sylph ceased to patrol for submarines. Assigned to Quonset Point, Rhode Island, she gave her full attention to training sonarmen and to the development of equipment and techniques for finding and sinking submarines. In October 1944, Sylph and her unit, the Surface Division of the Atlantic Fleet's Antisubmarine Development Detachment, shifted base to Port Everglades, Florida. She continued to train sonarmen there and assisted in the antisubmarine warfare research effort through the end of World War II. In September 1945, Sylph was ordered to the Commandant, 6th Naval District, at Charleston, South Carolina. She arrived at Charleston on 8 November and was decommissioned on 19 December. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 8 January 1946, and her hulk was sold by the War Shipping Administration on 31 December 1946. http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/s21/Sylph-iv.htm ReferencesExternal links Category:Patrol vessels of the United States Navy Category:World War II patrol vessels of the United States Category:Ships built in Boston Category:1929 ships ","title":"USS Sylph (PY-12)"},{"id":"49225188","text":"Sir Ganga Ram Hospital may refer to: * Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (India), Delhi, India * Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (Pakistan), Lahore, Pakistan ","title":"Sir Ganga Ram Hospital"},{"id":"49225218","text":"Eremophila galeata is a flowering plant in the figwort family, Scrophulariaceae and is endemic to Western Australia. It is a shrub with sticky, shiny leaves, unusual sepals, a dull pink and brown, spotted petal tube and which grows in stony red soils. Description Eremophila galeata is a shrub growing to between tall with very sticky branches, leaves and sepals due to the presence of large amounts of resin. The leaves are mostly long, wide, lance-shaped to narrow elliptic and have a stalk long. The flowers are borne singly or in pairs in leaf axils on a stalk long. There are 5 sepals which closely surround the petals and which differ greatly in size, enlarging after flowering. The sepal at the rear is egg-shaped, long, has a distinct raised ridge, and encloses the other sepals. The other sepals are long. All the sepals are sticky and usually greenish-brown to reddish-purple. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The tube is white, dull pink, yellowish-grey and pale lilac, spotted with reddish brown or purple on the inside of the petal lobes and the tube. The tube is covered with glandular hairs except for the inside of the petal lobes. The four stamens extend beyond the end of the petal tube. Flowering occurs from May to October and is followed by fruits which are dry, oval shaped and ridged with a pointed end and are long.Newman Taxonomy and naming Eremophila galeata was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The specific epithet (galeata) is a Latin word meaning \\"cover with a helmet\\" referring to the helmet-shaped sepal of the flowers of this species. Distribution and habitat This eremophila occurs between Leonora, Newman, Meekatharra, Wiluna and Mullewa areas in the Carnarvon, Gascoyne, Gibson Desert, Little Sandy Desert, Murchison, Pilbara and Yalgoo biogeographic regions Conservation status Eremophila galeata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture This eremophila has attractive, large, dark green, glossy leaves but its flowers are unremarkable. It is similar to E. fraseri except that it more frost resistant than that species.

The road was constructed in the 1950s by the Atomic Energy Commission to provide access for individual prospectors intent on mining uranium deposits for use in nuclear weapons production during the Cold War. Large deposits had been found in similar areas within the region; however, the mines along the White Rim Road produced very little uranium and all the mines were abandoned. The road surface consists of loose dirt, sandy dry washes and sandstone rock formations. Four-wheel drive vehicles and mountain bikes are the most common modes of transport though horseback riding and hiking are also permitted. Typical excursions at a modest pace take two days by four-wheel drive vehicle and three days by mountain bike. Street-legal, registered motorbikes are also permitted to travel on the road. The National Park Service (NPS), which administers the park and maintains the road, recommends bicyclists have a motorized support vehicle to carry extra water. No potable water is available anywhere along the road and there are few river access points. The Green River is accessible at spots along the western end of the road but Lathrop Canyon is the only access point to the Colorado River near the eastern terminus. Hikers may access the White Rim from the Island in the Sky by hiking down steep trails leading to seven points along the road. Roads leading to the White Rim Road are Mineral Bottom Road, also called Horsethief Trail, in the park's west side and Shafer Trail in the park's east side. Both roads are junctions off the Island in the Sky park road, which is an extension of Utah State Route 313. A shorter alternate from Moab is Potash RoadUtah State Route 279in the east side of the park which connects at the junction of White Rim Road with Shafer Trail. Like the Shafer Trail, White Rim Road is also sometimes referred to as a trail since a common term for a four-wheel drive road is a Jeep trail.  Features  Green River from Hardscrabble Hill Starting on Shafer Trail from the Island in the Sky mesa, a traveller will encounter hairpin turns, steep grades and cliffs with no guardrails. After a short distance along relatively flat terrain at the base of the mesa, the end of Shafer Trail is reached and the White Rim Road begins at the junction with Potash Road. The first river view is at the Gooseneck Overlook which offers a glimpse into the Colorado River canyon at the end of a round-trip hike. There is no access to the river from the cliff at the overlook. Subsequent features include Musselman Arch, Airport Tower butte, Monster Tower, and Washer Woman Arch, all visible from the road. A steep spur road leads down to the Colorado River through Lathrop Canyon. Back on the White Rim Road, one passes Buck Canyon, Gooseberry Canyon and Monument Basin with its rock pinnacles, followed by the White Crack campground spur road. The next challenge occurs at the steep Murphy Hogback which marks the approximate halfway point on the road. Soon after the Hogback, the Turks Head butte appears in the middle of an oxbow bend of the Green River. Candlestick Tower and Potato Bottom are next, followed by a round-trip hiking trail to Fort Bottom Ruin and then a steep, rocky section of road at Hardscrabble Hill. Finally, a spur road leads to two rock towers called Moses and Zeus. After crossing sandy dry washes, or arroyos, the White Rim Road ends just outside the national park boundary at the junction with Mineral Bottom Road and its hairpin turns leading one back up to the Island in the Sky.  Permits  Monument Basin Since September 2015, permits have been required for both day-use and overnight trips, whether by motor vehicle or bicycle, along the White Rim Road. The demand for permits frequently exceeds the number available in spring and fall months, especially March, April, May, September and October. Visitors are advised to make advance reservations. A maximum of 100 day-use permits are issued per day, with 50 reserved for motorized vehicles and 50 for bicycles. A total of 25 permits of each type are available as advance reservations, while the other 25 permits are available on the day of a trip. Each vehicle and bicycle in a group requires its own permit, including any stowed bicycles that are expected to be ridden at any point along the road. Group sizes are limited to three motor vehicles and 15 bicycles. Larger groups are required to leave 30 minutes apart to minimize dust and the potential convergence of several groups in one area. The limits were decided based on statistics gathered over a ten year period from 200414 when an average of 40 vehicles per day entered on the east side of the White Rim Road and an average of 26 vehicles per day entered on the west side. The limits are intended to provide a better wilderness experience for all visitors, and to minimize impacts on the natural surroundings. , no fees are required for day-use of the White Rim Road, though the park entrance fee still applies to all visitors in all park areas. No permit is required for traveling Shafer Trail or Potash Road, which are the only two roads that connect to the White Rim Road on its east side. The park service may institute day-use permit fees in future years to pay for administrative costs and backcountry patrols, according to a statement made by the Southeast Utah Group Superintendent of the NPS in 2015. Visitors staying overnight must camp in one of twenty sites within ten campground areas scattered along the road and some of its spurs. All overnight stays require a backcountry permit and a $30 fee for the full stay, up to 14 consecutive nights.  Regulations  Murphy Hogback The NPS requires all motorized vehicles including motorbikes be registered, street- legal and operated by licensed drivers only. ATVs, UTVs and OHVs are not permitted. All vehicles and bicycles must remain on the road surface. Pets are not permitted regardless of whether they could be kept inside a vehicle at all times. Campfires are not permitted. A high-clearance, four-wheel drive vehicle with a low gear range is required by park regulation since July 2014 on many backcountry roads including the White Rim Road. Front or rear-wheel drive only vehicles, as well as automatic all-wheel drive and low-clearance vehicles are not permitted. All drivers should be cautious at all times and be aware that towing fees usually exceed $1000 from the most remote areas. The road is rated moderately difficult for high-clearance, four-wheel drive vehicles in good weather conditions. The most difficult sections are the switchbacks of the Shafer Trail and Mineral Bottom Road, the Lathrop Canyon Road (an optional spur road), Murphy Hogback, and Hardscrabble Hill. Portions of the road near the Green River may be flooded during high water events. Horses and pack animals such as burros and mules are allowed on all backcountry roads with a permit. Day-use limits are no more than ten people and ten animals per group, and overnight limits are seven people and ten animals per group. Day-use permits are free and overnight trips incur a $30 backcountry fee. All animals must be fed only pelletized food for two days in advance of a trip and for the duration of the trip to reduce the chance of spreading non-native plant seeds through manure. No park vegetation may be consumed and all food and manure must be packed out on exit.

He had an advanced university education, therefore, and, considering his career, it must have been in law. For what it is worth, there was a fellow Piedmontese in the College of Cardinals, the influential Henry of Segusio, \\"Hostiensis\\", the most celebrated canon lawyer of his day, who had been a Professor at Bologna and Paris.Mauro Fattorini, De claris archigymnasii Bononiensis professoribus I, pars 1 (Bologna 1769), pp. 360-366. Nothing is known about Uberto Coconati's ecclesiastical status, except that he was an Apostolic Subdeacon. There is no evidence as to whether he proceeded to the Diaconate, the Priesthood, or the Episcopate. Early career In November, 1257, Uberto Coconati was present in Viterbo as a witness when Cardinal Stephanus (Istvan B√°ncsa), Bishop of Palestrina, issued a final ruling in a dispute between the Archbishop of Canterbury, Boniface of Savoy (1241-1270), and the Prior of the Convent of S. Trinity in London. He is called Magister Uberto de Coconato and is identified as a Papal Chaplain.W. Dugdale, J. Caley, H. Ellis, and B. Bandinel, Monasticon Anglicanum VI, part 1 (London 1830), p. 103 no. 22. On 23 December 1257, Pope Alexander IV granted to the Commune of Perugia the farmland (contado) in the neighborhood of Gubbio which belonged to the Roman Church for a period of five years, understanding that the Commune of Perugia would pay the annual assessment of 200 small Sienese pounds. Magister Uberto de Cocanato, Apostolic Subdeacon and papal chaplain, was appointed Executor on 28 December to convene a general assembly in Perugia to appoint a Syndic with appropriate powers to oversee the arrangement; he was also to swear the People of Perugia to obey the terms of the agreement under oath, with a penalty of 10,000 silver marks if they violated the agreement.V. Ansidri and L. Giannantoni, Bolletino di storia patria per l' Umbria 10 (Perugia 1904), pp. 74-77, 81. Ignazio Ciampi, Documenti di storia italiana, Tomo V: Cronacha e statute della Citt√† di Viterbo (Firenze 1872), pp. LXI-LXII. Magister Uberto then appointed the Bishop of Perugia as his Executor Subdelegate to oversee the transfers. Cardinal Uberto Coconati was one of seven cardinals created by Pope Urban IV in a Consistory of 17 (or 24) December 1261. He was assigned the Deaconry of San Eustachio.Eubel, p. 8 and p. 49. Cardinal Uberto was able to benefit his nephew, Alberto, when Vivi√°n, the bishop-elect of Calahorra presented himself at the Roman Curia at Orvieto, and was obligated to resign his Archdeaconry of Guadalajara.J. Guiraud, Les registres d'Urbain IV III (Paris 1904), no. 1787 (22 June 1264). Peter Linehan, The Spanish Church and the Papacy in the Thirteenth Century (Cambridge 1971), p. 288 and n. 2. Alberto also received a canonry and prebend in the Cathedral. But when he died at Asti in 1263, the benefices were handed on by papal favor to another of the Cardinal's nephews, Bonifacius de Coconato, clericus Verzellensis ('cleric of Vercelli').When Bonifacius de Coconato died in 1285, his canonry and prebend at York Minster were illegally seized by Master John de Cadomo. Pope Nicholas IV intrervened with King Edward I: Potthast, no. 22943. Another nephew, Rainerius, was confirmed as a prebendary of the Church of Leon in Spain, during a process ordered by Pope Urban IV to reduce the number of papal appointments in that Church from twelve, which had been granted by Alexander IV, to six.J. Guiraud, Les registres d'Urbain IV III (Paris 1904), p. 143 no. 1206 (1 December 1263). Peter Linehan, The Spanish Church and the Papacy in the Thirteenth Century (Cambridge 1971), p. 299 and n. 3. The large number of appointments included \\"expectancies\\", that is, appointments contingent upon the death or resignation of the incumbent. In 1265 Cardinal Uberto became the Protector of the diocese of Salamanca. When Bishop Domingo Dominici of Salamanca died on 30 January 1268, he left in a codicil to his Will 150 maravedis al cardenal don Uberto de Cucunato.Peter Linehan, The Spanish Church and the Papacy in the Thirteenth Century (Cambridge 1971), p. 308 and n. 4. The codicil is dated 1267. In 1267 Cardinal Uberto was named Auditor (judge) in the case of the confirmation of an Abbess for the monastery of S. Trinit√© de Ca√´n in the diocese of Bayeux.E. Jordan, Registres de Cl√©ment IV (Paris 1893), p. 172 no. 534 (Viterbo, 9 December 1267). Gallia christiana Tomus XI (Paris 1759), pp. 433-434. Council of Lyon He travelled to Lyon in 1273, and was present at the opening session of the Second Ecumenical Council of Lyon on 1 May 1274.Isidorus Carini, \\"Brevis Historia Concilii Lugdunensis,\\" in Specilegio Vaticano di documenti inediti e rari estratti dagli Archivi e dalla Biblioteca della Sede Apostolica Volume I (Roma: Ermanno Loescher 1890) pp. 250-251. Cardinal Uberto de Coconati was one of thirteen cardinals who attended a Consistory in Lyons on 6 June 1274, when the Pope and Cardinals received the Chancellor of Rudolf, King of the Romans, who had come to Lyons to arrange for papal recognition of Rudolf's election as Emperor.Augustinus Theiner, Codex diplomaticus dominii temporis Sanctis Sedis 1 (Romae 1861), p. 186. He was not, however, one of the cardinals who accompanied Pope Gregory X on his return journey to Italy; he was not present in Lausanne on 20 October 1275, when Pope Gregory received the Oath of Feudal Loyalty of Rudolf, King of the Romans. In 1275, while he was in Lyons, Cardinal Uberto became involved in the beginning phase of the long dispute between Tedisio de Camilla and his opponents, the Archbishops of Canterbury, first Robert Kilwardby (1273-1278) and then John Peckham (1279-1292). Both Primates of England disliked the idea of clergy holding multiple benefices which involved the care of souls at the same time, and particularly when they were foreigners appointed by the Roman Curia. Tedisio (Theodosius), an Italian from the territory of Genoa, was a cousin of Cardinal Ottobono Fieschi, who had been Apostolic Legate in England from 1265 to 1268. At the time the conflict began, Tedisio was Rector of Wingham (the King's Chapel) and Terringes as well as Dean of Wolverampton. He tenaciously refused to surrender his benefices and repeatedly appealed to the Pope. At one moment, Cardinal Uberto was appealed to, and he issued a letter advising Archbishop Kilwardby to desist. His letter is mentioned in a mandate of Pope Gregory X to the Archbishop to do nothing further about Tedisio until the Pope sends him further instructions.W. H. Bliss, Calendar of Entries in the Papal Registers relating to Great Britain and Ireland I (London 1893), p. 450. Gregory X actually authorized Tedisio to found a college at Wingham. On 13 November 1276, Pope John XXI dispensed Tedisio with respect to his benefices. He was instructed, however, to resign the parish of Wistanestea and Frondingham in the diocese of Lincoln, and the parish of Archexea in the diocese of York.W. H. Bliss, Calendar of Entries in the Papal Registers relating to Great Britain and Ireland I (London 1893), p. 451. Tedisio later became Bishop of Turin (1300-1319). It is clear that Tedisio had powerful friends at the Roman Curia, and that the policy of the English Archbishops interfered with papal prerogatives. It also is revealed that Tedisio was not an ordained priest, and he was dispensed from that requirement as well. Cardinal Uberto and eleven or twelve other cardinals participated in the Conclave of 20‚Äì21 January 1276, which followed the death of Pope Gregory X and which elected Pierre de Tarantaise as Pope Innocent V.Sede Vacante of January, 1276 (Dr. J. P. Adams). Cardinal Uberto also participated in the Conclave of 2‚Äì11 July 1276, which followed the death of Pope Innocent V and which elected Ottobono Fieschi as Pope Adrian V.Sede Vacante of June-July, 1276 (Dr. J. P. Adams). He ruled for thirty-nine days, was never ordained a priest, consecrated a bishop, or crowned as Pope. Cardinal Uberto Coconati was one of the cardinals who was present, according to Pope John XXI in his decree \\"Licet felicis\\", when Pope Adrian V suspended the Constitution of Pope Gregory X on conclaves, \\"Ubi Periculum\\".A. Tomassetti, Bullarum, Diplomatum et Privilegiorum Sanctorum Romanorum Pontificum Taurensis editio Volume IV (Turin 1859), pp. 37-38 (30 September 1276). The Consistory could only have taken place in Rome on 11 July, the day of his election, or perhaps 12 July. Pope Adrian was already in Viterbo on 23 July, when he signed his only bull.Augustus Potthast, Regesta pontificum Romanorum II (Berlin 1875), p. 1709 no. 21149. This decision to suspend the Conclave regulations had dire consequences over the next thirty years, since it facilitated the manipulation of cardinals in Conclave by outside parties, especially King Charles I of Naples. Death Cardinal Uberto Coconati died in Rome on 13 July 1276, two days after the election of Pope Adrian V (Ottobono Fieschi).Annales Veronenses, in Antiche croniche Veronesi I, ed. C.

Prior to her appointment as Chief Justice, Mambilima was the Chairperson of the Electoral Commission of Zambia. In this position, she presided over Zambia's 2006, 2011 presidential and parliamentary elections, and the January 2015 presidential by-election. She has been part of several election observer missions including in Liberia, Kenya, Mozambique and Seychelles. Other past international assignments have included serving as Sessional Judge of the Supreme Court of The Gambia. Mambilima sits on the International Board of the International Association of Women Judges (IAWJ) as a Director of the Africa Region. She is also a member of a number of professional associations including the Zambia Association of Women Judges, the Editorial Board Council of Law Reporting, the Child Fund (Zambia), Women in Law Southern Africa, and the Council of the Institution of Advanced Legal Education. Mambilima's appointment as Chief Justice was unanimously ratified by the Zambian Parliament in February 2015, making her the country's first female Chief Justice.Mambilima Appointment Ratified. Zambia Daily Mail, 27 February 2015  Education and background  Justice Mambilima holds a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) from the University of Zambia, a Post Graduate Diploma in Law Practice from the Law Practice Institute (now known as the Zambia Institute of Advanced Legal Education, ZIALE), and a Master of Laws (LL.M.) from the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. She was admitted to the Zambian Bar in 1977 and in the same year appointed State Advocate under the Attorney General's Chambers. She rose through the ranks, working in various capacities including as Director of Legal Aid, High Court Judge, Supreme Court Judge and Deputy Chief Justice.  Supreme Court  In 2002 she was elevated to the Supreme Court bench. While serving as a Supreme Court Judge, she was seconded to the Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ) as Chairperson in 2005. In that capacity, she presided over the 2006 General Elections. In 2008 she was recalled from ECZ and appointed as Deputy Chief Justice.Mambilima Appointment Ratified.

She was appointed as Chief Justice in February 2015 and took the oath of office at State House on March 2, 2015. = Early decisions = Two of Justice Mambilima's most high-profile decisions have centred on the tribunals constituted to investigate alleged corruption and abuse of office by the former Transport and Communications Minister in the Rupiah Banda administration and the former Director of Public Prosecutions in the Michael Sata administration. The tribunal to investigate Dora Siliya, former Transport and Communications Minister, was established to investigate allegations that she awarded contracts to two firms without following laid down procedures in violation of Parliamentary and Ministerial Code of Conduct Act.Acting Chief Justice to set up tribunal to probe Siliya. Lusakatimes, 27 February 2009 The tribunal was set up in February 2009, and it's published findings found Ms. Siliya in breach of multiple statutes, but left the resolution in the president's hands. Siliya did not face prosecution. In the case of the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Mutembo Nchito, on March 16, 2015 Justice Mambilima swore in four members of the tribunal appointed by President Edgar Lungu to investigate him for alleged misconduct.Nchito tribunal members sworn in.

The tribunal proceedings remain unresolved.  Electoral Commission of Zambia = Chairperson = Justice Mambilima was first appointed as chairperson of Electoral Commission of Zambia (ECZ) in 2005, a position she held until March 2008. She had previously served as member of the commission between 1994 and 1996. She was later re-appointed as Chair in February 2011Judge Mambilima goes back to ECZ.

Lusakatimes, 28 February 2011 Mambilima's re-appointment by President Rupiah Banda was seen as a move to restore confidence in the commission, though speculation abounded that government fanned the confusion to force out Justice Mumba; a charge government denied.Jitters as Banda Picks Electoral Agency Boss. Africa Review, 16 February 2011. Various opposition party leaders and the leading private newspaper saw Justice Mambilima as government friendly, and this was illustrated in the run up to the 2011 general elections when she and the commission came under heavy criticism for the decision to print ballot papers in South Africa. Government Printing Department indicated its lack of capacity to complete the task, and in the subsequent procurement process Universal Print Group (Pty) Ltd. of Durban, South Africa was awarded the tender. This move was seen as a scheme by the ruling MMD to print pre-marked ballots in a bid to rig the elections in their favour. There were multiple allegations of corruption but no official investigations were launched or validated by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), and ECZ stood by its decision to use the firm.ECZ Chairperson Mambilima happy with printing of ballots. QFM Zambia, 30 August 2011 = 2006 General Elections = The 2006 general elections were held on 28 September. Opposition leader Michael Sata took an early lead in the count but as the majority of results came in his position slipped to third with the incumbent President Levy Mwanawasa taking a commanding lead. This announcement triggered protests by Sata's supporters in the country's capital, Lusaka and later spread to Kitwe, an industrial city in the copper mining region.Riots Spread as Incumbent Widens Lead in Zambia Vote. New York Times, 3 October 2006. The protests were met with force by armed police. And the electoral commission delayed the announcement of more results because of the violence. Sata alleged fraud citing that 400,000 votes in his strongholds were unaccounted for in the ongoing tally, and vowed to challenge the results. Justice Mambilima confirmed that the commission would investigate the complaints but none were substantiated.Poll Victory for Zambia President. BBC News, 2 October 2006. Mwanawasa emerged victorious, securing a second term in office with 1,177,846 votes to Michael Sata's 804,748. The president's ruling party, Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD), secured 45% of the seats in parliament, with the remainder split among the remaining parties. He was sworn into office on October 3, 2006 serving until his death on August 19, 2008. = 2008 Presidential By-Elections = Following the death of President Levy Mwanawasa in office, a special presidential by-election was called to fill the vacancy. The main contenders were the country's vice-president Rupiah Banda, Michael Sata and Hakainde Hichilema. Once again there were allegations of rigging by the ruling party, aided by the electoral commission. Justice Mambilima did not oversee these elections as ECZ chair as she had taken up her new position as Deputy Chief Justice. Her successor Justice Florence Mumba defended the commission's work in difficult and unprecedented circumstances, and assured the nation that the elections would be conducted in a credible manner.ECZ Denies Vote-Rigging Claims. IOL News, 22 October 2008 Rupiah Banda won by a narrow margin, and opposition protests similar to those in 2006 ensued. This did not change the outcome or compel the commission to call for a recount.

In her ruling, Justice Mambilima threw out the petition, declaring \\"...the application is refused...with costs.\\"Zambia Court Rejects Recount Bid. IOL News, 11 March 2009. The court deemed the petition premature since no evidence was given to support a recount. Sata discontinued his court action. = 2011 General Elections = Zambia went to the polls on September 20, 2011 and as early results came through opposition leader Michael Sata was in the lead. Later it was shown on ECZ's official website that Sata had widened his lead in 133 out of 150 constituencies but the site was later taken offline with the commission claiming it was hacked and that the results weren't official. This led to an outcry that the commission was indeed working with the ruling party to rig the election in Rupiah Banda's favour. Justice Mambilima later appeared on national television to confirm the election results,Zambia Opposition Leads Incumbent in Presidential Election. Bloomberg News, 21 September 2011. a first for a sitting ECZ chairperson. She also appealed for calm as tallying continued through the night. On September 23, 2011 Michael Sata was confirmed as the duly elected president of Zambia. Days later it was revealed that outgoing president Rupiah Banda resisted conceding defeat and Justice Mambilima threatened resignation in protest. This is largely unverified but accepted lore among Zambians despite Justice Mambilima's protestations. After the new government was ushered in, she called for them to help decentralise ECZ, allowing them to hire full-time employees at district level to improve efficiencies and be funded appropriately. In the aftermath of these polls Mambilima was largely praised for the commission's conduct. She was seen as tough and unyielding in the face of political pressure. However, with a slew of parliamentary results later overturned through the courts on various grounds such as electoral malpractice it has been questioned whether ECZ and other bodies were correct in declaring the polls free and fair.2011 General Elections were Free and Fair. Lusakatimes, 28 March 2014. = 2015 Presidential By-elections = A presidential by-election was held on January 20, 2015 following the death of President Michael Sata. The election was tightly contested between the ruling Patriotic Front (PF) and opposition United Party for National Development (UPND), the parties that eventually finished first and runner-up, respectively. With a charged atmosphere and violence seemingly imminent, Justice Mambilima took a firm stand and warned the two front-runners against trying to intimidate electoral staff. Justice Mambilima, who is sometimes called Zambia's 'iron lady' in reference to her firmness, also warned against claiming electoral victory before the official announcement and inciting premature celebration among supporters. The UPND wrote to Justice Mambilima claiming electoral malpractice by the PF and asking her not to declare a winner, a request the Commission did not indulge. When Edgar Lungu was declared winner, the UPND accused the Electoral Commission of conniving with the PF to manipulate the results, an allegation that Justice Mambilima dismissed. She argued that the process had been transparent and the UPND had been represented at every stage and would therefore also be party to the rigging they were accusing the Commission of. The following month, the UPND supported Justice Mambilima's ratification as Chief Justice.

She is a third-generation Chicana from Stockton, California.  Early life  Felix was born in Stockton, California on March 15, 1953. Her mother was from Fresno, California and her father was from Texas. Her parents were second-generation Chicanos from farm-working families. She attended San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton, where she learned to DJ. She worked at Intel while at San Jose University in San Jose. She later started her own business, Felix Computers, building computers at home while in San Francisco.Hidalgo de la Riva, Osa. Chicana Spectators and Mediamakers. Spectator 26:1 (Spring 2006): 21-26  Activism  Diane Felix attributes her passion for activism to the various events that she experienced including the murder of the Chicano journalist, Ruben Salazar, by police during the National Chicano Moratorium March against the Vietnam War. = United Farm Workers (UFW) = Felix became involved with the United Farm Workers (UFW) after Cesar Chavez gave a talk at her high school. She helped organize the grape boycott in San Francisco and Los Angeles. = Gay Latina/Latino Alliance (GALA) = In 1975, the Gay Latina/Latino Alliance (GALA) was officially formed. The organization meant to tackle the racism present in the LGBT community, demand political change, and provide a community for gay Latinos. They partook in and coordinated an assortment of events, including a march against Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a, the 73rd and 76th Nicaraguan president as well as various dance parties. Felix first became interested in the group that was to become the Gay Latina/Latino Alliance after reading an ad in the Bay Area Reporter. The ad called for a meeting between gay Latinos who were interested in political organizing. Her trip to San Francisco to attend the second general meeting of the group resulted in her permanent relocation to San Francisco from San Jose. She became one of the three lesbians in the group, alongside Al√≠ Marerro and Mat√∫ Feliciano, and played a large role in the development of the group. She formed a Women's Caucus and proposed the official name change from Gay Latino Alliance to Gay Latina/Latino Alliance.Ramirez, Roque, and Horacio N. ‚Äú‚ÄòThat‚Äôs My Place!‚Äô: Negotiating Racial, Sexual, and Gender Politics in San Francisco‚Äôs Gay Latino Alliance, 1975-1983.‚Äù Journal of the History of Sexuality 12, no. 2 (2003): 224‚Äì58. However, despite her efforts to address the misogyny in the group, the sexism only escalated when two GALA members, Anthony Lopez and Manuel Quijano, sold their house to buy a bar. The bar, Esta Noche, served to further marginalize queer women in queer spaces. In an interview with Horacio Roque Ram√≠rez, Diane Felix revealed, > Because he [the owner] had hired women bartenders, and we would have > meetings and we would tell them, there's a lot of straight Latino men coming > in and they're harassing the women, they're harassing the lesbians. [He'd > say,] \\"Well, this isn't a political organization, we don't want to hear that > anymore, this is a business, this is a bar.\\" The group eventually disbanded due to internal issues, including sexism. = Community United in Response to AIDS/SIDA (CURAS) = In 1983, Felix co- founded the Community United in Response to AIDS/SIDA (CURAS). It was the first grassroots Latino community response to the AIDS outbreak in San Francisco. She began as a volunteer, but later became office manager for the group. She later moved into a new position, working as an outreach member for the project. Later, she transitioned into the role of the coordinator of outreach. She was a health educator for the organization before it lost its funding and finally dissolved in 1992. She also created the program Curanderas, which was later renamed to Mujeres Unidas and Activistas, to address health education and provide health services to immigrant women in the Mission District in San Francisco. = Proyecto ContraSIDA Por Vida (PCPV) = In 1993, Felix co-founded Proyecto ContraSIDA Por Vida (PCPV), a community- based organization dedicated to providing sex-positive health education to queer communities. While there, she held various positions, such as Program Director, Coordinator of Women's Programs, and Coordinator of LYBRES.Rodr√≠guez, Juana Mar√≠a. Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces. New York: NYU Press, 2003. Felix coordinated various projects while at the agency to address Latina lesbian and bisexual health, including the project Lesbianas y Bisexuales Respondiendo con Educaci√≥n Sexual (LYBRES). LYBRES passed out contraceptives at bars to promote safe sex and also held workshops and discussion for women. Another project she oversaw was the educational performance group called ¬°Sinverg√ºenza! The group performed skits about their experiences, sexual health, and other relevant topics the last Saturday of every month at Felix's club, Colors. Proyecto ContraSIDA Por Vida stopped serving the community in August 2005.  Art = Media mixing = Diane first began DJing in the early 1970s while at San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton. She was able to secure a position with a Chicano Station, KUOP as a DJ. She has played on the Latin Stage of the San Francisco Gay and Lesbian Parade for seven years. She has also played at Circus and The Arena in Los Angeles, California. = Theatre = In 1971, she wrote two of the three plays selected for a theatrical series at San Joaquin Delta College. The first play which was titled, La Macha, is about a high school Chicana grappling with the misogyny she faces at home from her family. After deciding she is fed up with it all, she has a dream about a world in which gender roles are reversed. She dreams of herself coming home from work in a suit to her homemaking husband. The second play was a romance about two star-crossed lovers. One of the characters is the son of a farm owner and the other character is a Chicana protesting the labor conditions existing at the farm with the United Farm Workers. They are unable to be open about their interests in each other because of their roles so they sneak around and only communicate publicly via exchanges of glances and material possessions. She was first involved with El Teatro Campesino in Juan Bautista, but later joined Teatro de la Gente when she moved to San Jose. She talks about her relationship with Teatro de la Gente in her interview with Osa de La Riva, > I joined Teatro de la Gentre in San Jose. But because I was a dyke, they did > not want me in the group. And they gave me a lot of bullshit and put me > through a lot of unnecessary drama. So I walked away. She became involved in theatre again at a city college.  DJ & club promotion  Diane Felix began to DJ at A Little More on Potrero Hill, a predominantly Filipina club, in 1976. This club had its own softball team called Un Poquito Mas, composed of Women of Color. In an attempt to create spaces for queer women of color, she hosted the first club night for queer Latina women in the Mission District in 1986 and called it, \\"Colors.\\" It closed in 2000. Since arriving in San Francisco, she has been a pivotal person in producing, hosting, and promoting queer Latino-themed club nights in the Bay Area including: Cream (at Space 550) and Kandy in the Castro, Octopussy in San Jose; the dance parties, \\"Delicious\\" at The Cafe in San Francisco, and Pan Dulce, an all-gender queer Latino dance party.

Hellerstedt, 579 U.S. ___ (2016), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court decided on June 27, 2016. The Court ruled 5‚Äì3 that Texas cannot place restrictions on the delivery of abortion services that create an undue burden for women seeking an abortion. On June 28, 2016, the Supreme Court refused to hear challenges from Wisconsin and Mississippi where federal appeals courts had struck down similar laws. Other states with similar laws may also be impacted.  Background  In 2013, Texas passed a law, H.B. 2, placing a series of restrictions on abortion clinics within the state. In November 2013, one of H.B. 2's requirements that abortion providers have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles took effect. In the time since the admitting privileges requirement took effect, the number of abortion clinics in Texas declined from 42 to 19. The law also required abortion providers to meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers and to upgrade their building, safety, parking, and staffing to meet the standards of a hospital room. Whole Woman's Health, however, has deemed these requirements unnecessary and expensive as well as an attempt to limit abortion access rather than provide safety to women. This part of the law was enforced in Texas in the beginning of October 2014, but its enforcement was suspended pending the outcome of this case. Texas had waived some or all of the surgical-center requirements for 336 of the 433 (78%) licensed ambulatory surgical centers in Texas,Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , slip. op. at 12 but had not waived any part of the surgical-center requirements for any of the abortion clinics in the state.Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , slip. op. at 5 =First lawsuit= A group of plaintiffs including Whole Woman's Health sued, bringing a facial challenge to the admitting-privileges provision. On October 28, 2013, the day before the law was to take effect, Judge Earl Leroy Yeakel III of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas in Austin, Texas granted the plaintiffs an injunction invalidating the provision.Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 951 F.Supp2d 891 (W.D. Tex. 2013). Three days later, a motions panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit made of Circuit Judges Priscilla Owen, Jennifer Walker Elrod, and Catharina Haynes, granted an emergency stay of the injunction, allowing the law to go into effect.Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 734 F. 3d 406 (5th Cir. 2013). On November 19, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to vacate the stay, with Justice Scalia, joined by Justices Thomas and Alito, writing a concurrence and Justice Breyer, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan, writing a dissent.Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. v. Abbott, 134 S. Ct. 506, 571 U.S., 187 L. Ed. 2d 465 (2013). On March 27, 2014, Circuit Judge Edith Jones, joined by Judges Elrod and Haynes, upheld the challenged provision.Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. v. Abbott, 748 F. 3d 583 (5th Cir. 2014). Whole Woman's Health did not petition the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. =Second lawsuit= On April 6, 2014, Whole Woman's Health filled a new lawsuit, now seeking to block the admitting-privileges provision as applied to the Whole Woman's Health in McAllen, Texas and the Nova Health Systems in El Paso, Texas, as well as to block the surgical centre provision throughout Texas. The court held a four-day bench trial and on August 29, 2014, Judge Yeakel issued a state-wide injunction barring enforcement of both provisions.Whole Woman's Health v. Lakey, 46 F. Supp. 3d 673 (W.D. Tex. 2014). On October 2, 2014, Circuit Judge Elrod, joined by Judge Jerry Edwin Smith and with Stephen A. Higginson dissenting in part, stayed the lower court's injunction pending appeal.Whole Woman‚Äôs Health v. Lakey, 769 F. 3d 285 (5th Cir. 2014). On October 14, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the Fifth Circuit, reimposing the injunction blocking the law, over a dissent by Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito.Whole Woman's Health v. Lakey, 135 S. Ct. 399, 574 U.S., 190 L. Ed. 2d 247 (2014). On June 9, 2015, Circuit Judges Edward C. Prado, Elrod, and Haynes, in an anonymous per curiam decision, found on the merits that the two provisions were constitutional.Whole Women‚Äôs Health v. Cole, 790 F. 3d 563 (per curiam), modified, 790 F. 3d 598 (5th Cir. 2015). The Fifth Circuit reversed the court order protecting the El Paso clinic but upheld the order protecting the McAllen clinic. The three-judge panel upheld the majority of the Texas law.Whole Woman's Health v. Cole, No. 14-50928, slip. op. at 56 (5th Cir. 2015) (per curiam). The panel held that the law was constitutional under Planned Parenthood v. Casey's undue burden standard because the law \\"does not place a substantial obstacle in path of those women seeking an abortion\\".Whole Woman's Health v. Cole, slip. op. at 55 (5th Cir. 2015).  Supreme Court  Before H.B. 2 could take effect, the petitioners requested a stay from the Supreme Court. On June 29, 2015, the court granted a temporary stay by a 5‚Äì4 vote, and it later granted an indefinite stay. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito would have denied the stay. On November 13, 2015, the court granted a writ of certiorari to review the Fifth Circuit's holding. Over eighty amicus curiae briefs were filed with the Court, including one signed by prominent female lawyers stating that they had each had an abortion and the decision had paved the way for their legal careers. Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, Br. Am. Curiae of Janice Macavoy et al., filed Jan. 4, 2016 (\\"‚ÄúTo the world, I am an attorney who had an abortion, and, to myself, I am an attorney because I had an abortion.‚Äù) A competing brief in support of the Texas law was filed on behalf of women who said they suffered psychological or physical harm due to their abortions. On February 13, 2016, Justice Scalia died, leaving eight justices to hear the case. Ninety minutes of oral arguments were heard on March 2, 2016, with Scott Keller, the Solicitor General of Texas, appearing for the state, Stephanie Toti of the Center for Reproductive Rights appearing for Whole Woman's Health, and Donald B. Verrilli Jr., the Solicitor General of the United States, appearing as a friend of the court in support of the clinic. During the questioning phase of the oral arguments, the liberal side of the court, including Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan, questioned the true intention of the law and Texas's justification for it. Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller argued that women living far from Texas abortion clinics‚Äì‚Äìdue to the closure of many abortion clinics struggling to comply with the requirement's standards‚Äì‚Äìwere not unduly burdened in gaining access to abortions because they could access clinics in New Mexico, a state with more lenient standards. In response, Justice Ginsburg noted: \\"So if your argument is right, then New Mexico is not an available way out for Texas, because Texas says: To protect our women, we need these things. But send them off to New Mexico... and that‚Äôs perfectly all right.\\" =Opinion of the Court= Justice Stephen Breyer was the author of the Court's opinion. On June 27, 2016, the Court ruled by a 5‚Äì3 vote that Texas cannot place restrictions on the delivery of abortion services that create an undue burden for women seeking an abortion, and therefore the sections of Texas law H.B. 2 challenged here are invalid. In an opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer, the court struck down key provisions of the law‚Äì‚Äìthose requiring doctors who perform abortions to have difficult-to-obtain \\"admitting privileges\\" at a local hospital and requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities‚Äì‚Äìas violating a woman's right to an abortion. Observing that these provisions do not offer medical benefits sufficient to justify the burdens upon access that each imposes, the majority concluded: \\"Each places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a pre- viability abortion, each constitutes an undue burden on abortion access, and each violates the federal Constitution.\\" The majority opinion struck down both provisions \\"facially\\", that is, the very words of the provisions are invalid, irrespective of how they might be implemented or applied. According to the ruling, the task of judging whether a law puts an unconstitutional burden on a woman's right to abortion rests with the courts and not the legislatures. Justice Breyer wrote, \\"We have found nothing in Texas‚Äô record evidence that shows that, compared to prior law (which required a ‚Äúworking arrangement‚Äù with a doctor with admitting privileges), the new law advanced Texas‚Äô legitimate interest in protecting women's health.\\" He noted that, when asked at oral argument whether Texas knew of a single instance in which the new requirement would have helped even one woman obtain better treatment, Texas admitted that there was no evidence in the record of such a case.Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , slip. op. at 23 He found that, if H.B. 2 were allowed to take full effect, the number of Texan women living more than 200 miles from the nearest abortion clinic would increase from 10,000 to 750,000.Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , slip. op. at 6 Justice Breyer dismissed the state's claim that the Pennsylvania case of Kermit Gosnell justified additional regulation: \\"Gosnell's behavior was terribly wrong. But there is no reason to believe that an extra layer of regulation would have affected that behavior. Determined wrongdoers, already ignoring existing statutes and safety measures, are unlikely to be convinced to adopt safe practices by a new overlay of regulations. Regardless, Gosnell‚Äôs deplorable crimes could escape detection only because his facility went un-inspected for more than 15 years. Pre- existing Texas law already contained numerous detailed regulations covering abortion facilities, including a requirement that facilities be inspected at least annually.\\"Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, , slip. op. at 27 =Concurrence= In a two-page concurrence, Justice Ginsburg wrote, \\"Many medical procedures, including childbirth, are far more dangerous to patients, yet are not subject to ambulatory surgical-center or hospital admitting- privileges requirements. ... Given those realities, it is beyond rational belief that H. B. 2 could genuinely protect the health of women, and certain that the law 'would simply make it more difficult for them to obtain abortions.' ... When a State severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners. ... [L]aws like H. B. 2 that 'do little or nothing for health, but rather strew impediments to abortion' cannot survive judicial inspection.\\" =Dissents= Justice Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, stating that the majority \\"reimagines the undue-burden standard\\" for abortion access, creating a \\"benefits-and-burdens balancing test\\" that courts should have instead deferred to the legislatures to resolve. Justice Alito, joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas, filed a second dissenting opinion, arguing that there is no direct causal link between the Texas law and the closings of abortion clinics, and they may have also been affected by the withdrawal of state funds, declining demand for abortions, and retirements of doctors. Alito also stated that Texas might well have been motivated to protect women by the Kermit Gosnell case in Pennsylvania, in which a doctor had been convicted on three charges of murder and one of manslaughter. Subsequent developments=Reception= Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised the decision as a victory for women, saying \\"By striking down politically motivated restrictions that made it nearly impossible for Texans to exercise their full reproductive rights, the Court upheld every woman‚Äôs right to safe, legal abortion, no matter where she lives.\\" President Obama issued a statement applauding the Court's decision and reiterating his commitment to \\"women's health, including protecting a woman's access to safe, affordable health care and her right to determine her own future.\\" Senator Bernie Sanders applauded the decision, calling it a \\"decisive victory for women across the country.\\" Senator Ted Cruz expressed disappointment with the ruling, saying \\"the Supreme Court sided with abortion extremists who care more about providing abortion- on-demand than they do protecting women‚Äôs health.\\" He also vowed to fight for \\"unborn life.\\" A statement issued on behalf of the Catholic Church bishops in Texas said the decision \\"puts women at grave risk\\" because \\"Surgical abortion is an invasive procedure that poses numerous and serious medical complications. The state has a legitimate interest in ensuring the maximum level of safety for the woman subjected to the procedure and that viable emergency care is available if complications such as hemorrhage, infection, uterine perforation, blood clots, cervical tears, or allergic reactions occur. It is irresponsible for physicians to perform this procedure without being able to provide follow-up treatment for the associated complications.\\" The decision may impact similar restrictions on abortion access in other states.Steve Vladeck, a professor of law at American University Washington College of Law, stated: Vladeck also added that =Other cases= At the time of the decision, five states required abortion clinics to operate under \\"hospital-like\\" standards: Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Tennessee, though in the last of these a court order prevented enforcement. Nine states required doctors to have hospital admitting privileges, of which three were enforcing that requirement (North Dakota, Missouri, and Tennessee) and six were not (Wisconsin, Kansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama). A few hours after the Supreme Court announced its ruling, Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange announced he would drop his appeal of a U.S. District Court ruling that had invalidated the state's hospital admitting privileges requirement for abortion providers. On June 28, 2016, the Supreme Court declined appeals in related cases from Wisconsin and Mississippi. It let stand a ruling that the state of Washington can require pharmacists to fill prescriptions for contraceptives to which they have religious objections. Justice Alito, in a dissent joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Thomas, wrote: \\"If this is a sign of how religious liberty claims will be treated in the years ahead, those who value religious freedom have cause for great concern.\\" The court also rejected appeals by Mississippi and Wisconsin that sought to require abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges. Louisiana had passed Act 620 in 2014, modeled after Texas' law that would require doctors to have admission privileges at a hospital within 30 miles, effectively reducing the number of legal clinics to one at the time of passage. The law was challenged by abortion clinics and doctors in June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo, and while the District Court ordered an injunction to prevent the law going into effect, the Fifth Circuit reversed the injunction. The plaintiffs were able to obtain an emergency stay on the Fifth Circuit's decision from the Supreme Court to be held under Whole Woman's Health was under litigation. Following this case's decision, the Louisiana law was declared unconstitutional by the District Court on rehearing on the basis of Whole Woman's Health, but the Fifth Circuit again reversed the decision. Plaintiffs have again sought an emergency stay order from the Supreme Court. On February 7, 2019, the United States Supreme Court granted a stay and temporarily enjoined the state of Louisiana from enforcing the law while the plaintiffs appeal the decision of the Fifth Circuit. The Supreme Court ruled on June 29, 2020 that the Louisiana law was similarly unconstitutional, with Roberts as the deciding vote. Roberts maintained his position of dissent in the opinion of the court but upheld the judgement of unconstitutionality as found in Whole Woman's Health as a matter of past court precedent.

It is a circular plate made as a gift item. It is a handicraft consisting of metals such as silver, bronze, and copper embossed with figures of gods and goddesses at its center. The artwork has been registered for protection under the Geographical indication of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. It is listed at item 63 as \\"Thanjavur Art Plate\\" of the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India, with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks. Only the size of the article is permitted to be different while other metal compositions and particularization have to remain the same as per GI approval. History The Thanjavur Art Plate or plaque was introduced by Rajah Serfoji-II (1777-1832) during the Maratha rule in Thanjavur. It was made as an exclusive gift item by the artisans of Thanjavur at the suggestion of the Rajah. The artifact is crafted exclusively by the community of Vishwakarmas, which consists of a few goldsmith families of Thanjavur. It is an inherited art, and is a way of living for them. It is a declared cottage industry as it is made in the houses of the craftsmen. Its manufacture is the prerogative of the menfolk only. A plaque made in the 20th century was displayed at the Government Museum in Thanjavur during 2011. This plaque made of the prescribed metals has in the relief images of Nataraja, the sage Pathanjali, and the goddess Sivakami in a standing posture over a lotus flower, encrusted at the plate's central part. Process of manufacture The artifact consists of three components: the base plate, a circular plate of metals with primary relief, and the secondary relief. Sheets of brass are used to make the base plate, silver sheets to craft the reliefs, lead to create moulds to project the three-dimensional images, and an asphalt or wax board to fix the plate. The base plate is prepared first by craftsman specialized in heavy metals. Then the crafting of designs or reliefs is done by jewelers, and the encrusting of the relief is the prerogative of the diamond-setting expert. The procedure of manufacture involves the making of the base plate followed by the casting of the copper plate, preparing moulds, and crafting the motifs on copper plates and dyes. The base plate is also covered with motifs. Floral and other designs are carved on the reliefs, and the product is then finished by polishing. The art plates are marketed within the country and also exported. They are marketed by the artisans themselves or in handicraft showrooms and through exporters.
