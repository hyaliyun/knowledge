Biography  Mencia was born in Villa de Medellín, Badajoz (Spain) daughter of Alonso Calderón and Ana Ocampo, belonging to a noble family of Extremadura. She was married to Juan de Sanabria, a noble Spanish expeditionary who died shortly before leaving for New Spain. Through his mother, Mencía Calderón, was related to Francisco Pizarro and Hernán Cortés, belonging to noble Castilian families. On April 10, 1550, Mencía Calderón embarked to America. In the expedition traveled 300 passengers, among which there were captains Salazar and Saavedra, Calderon's daughters, 50 eligible maidens, the wives of various conquerors, 80 sailors, and adventurer Hans Staden, who would write the chronicle of the expedition. The fleet survived storms and attacks by French corsairs before managing to reach the isle of Santa Catalina. From there, they made their way to the coast of Brazil, where they settled for a year while repairing their ships and building new, more fit ones with what was left of the others. After this period of rest they left to Asunción. The arguments between Salazar y Saavedra became constant, and it was Mencía who managed to organize the expedition and keep the group together. Mencía took the rank of Adelantada upon herself and guided an expedition of men and women across 1.600 km of rainforest, following the same path that years before had followed Alejo García and Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca. They reached Asunción in 1555, where some problems erupted when the women who had come to meet their husbands found them already remarried to indigenous women, and with mestizo children, some of which were already in their teens.Benítez, Luis G.; en \\"Historia del Paraguay.

It is their first independent release after departing from their previous record label Red Blue Records. It was recorded at The Square Studio in Syracuse, New York with producer Steve Sopchak and was released on March 1, 2013. The album was funded by fan donations through an extremely successful Kickstarter campaign. Kickstarter On September 27, 2012, The Venetia Fair announced on AbsolutePunk that they were leaving Red Blue Records, who they had been signed with for three years, and that they would be releasing their next album independently. On October 22, 2012, they launched a Kickstarter campaign to crowdfund the recording and release of 'Every Sick, Disgusting Thought We've Got In Our Brain'. They released two videos explaining the campaign on YouTube. They set an original goal of raising $8,000 to cover the minimal cost of recording and releasing the album. They surpassed this goal within four days and set additional 'stretch goals' of $11,000 and $15,000 to fund additional costs including making music videos and bringing in outside musicians to be featured on the album. The band offered 30 different reward option for donating fans. Reward options included $5 for a digital download of the album, $50 for a personal thank you note and drawing from guitarist Michael Abiuso, or more expensive options for the more dedicated fans such as $200 for the costumes members wore for their first music video The Ringleader in 2009, $225 for bassist Mr. Chark's hair collection, $9,975 for one of drummer Chris Constantino's two pinky fingers, or $10,000 for one of Mr. Chark's three pinky fingers. On November 21, 2012, The Venetia Fair had raised a total of $17,657. Recording/production The Venetia Fair began recording the album at Square Studio in Syracuse, NY. This was their second time working with producer Steve Sopchak AKA The Internet AKA The Dew Master, who also produced their 2011 EP 'The Pits'. The outside musicians that were brought into the studio for the album were Chris Nolan of the band The Action on trumpet and French horn, Dan King on trombone, Jake Weinreb on xylophone, Stephanie Babirak on harp, and Asspoop AKA Jeff Eckert on backing vocals. Concept Six of the songs on the album are part of a story line called The Scientist And The Painter about a man who is a scientist who believes that if God is a ubiquitous being, he must exist in the only infinite thing we know of which is the capacity of the human mind (I: We Used To Worship The Moon). The man then meets a woman with a 'questionable past', falls in love, and begins painting a portrait of her (II: The Dirt Won't Keep Your Secrets). She inevitably betrays him and leaves. In his heartbreak, he starts to go insane and dedicates his time to his two passions: searching for the truth about God through his research, and creating the portrait he started painting of the woman (III: Go On, Paint Me A Picture). He uses his memory as the only reference for the portrait, but can never get the color of her lips right. At one point, he tried to use his own blood as paint, and still can't get the color correct. (V: You Never Looked Like This). He continues trying to find God. Claiming it's for the greater good and will eventually pay off, he begins killing people and bringing them back to his lab to literally search their brains to find God, because the mind is infinite just like God purportedly is. The man is disgusted with himself, but he loves it (IV: The Saints Of Gomorrah). The painting of the woman begins to look less and less like the actual woman, and becomes a portrait of his idealized vision of her in his memory, blocking out all of the negative things about her. During one of his outings, he meets the woman again but doesn't recognize her. He kills her and brings her back to his lab and only then realizes who she is. He isn't too bothered by his actions because he's fallen more in love with his memory of her and the portrait than the actual woman herself (V: You Never Looked Like This). After killing her, he finds that she was pregnant with his child. He then breaks down further and believes he hears his unborn son speaking to him. The son explains to his father that God can't be inside the infant's brain because no one was able to place him there. He convinces his father that the only place left that God could possibly be is the man's own brain. The man then kills himself by cracking his head on the concrete floor to release God into the world (VI: I Could End My Search Tonight).

Early life and education Mitchell was born in 1940 in Englewood, New Jersey, the son of James A. Mitchell (1896 – 1967), an early civil rights activist. He left home as a teenager and studied in Europe at the Sorbonne and the University of Madrid before returning to the States. He graduated from Columbia University in 1967 with a degree in comparative literature. Career Following graduation he worked in the field of environmental education and then began freelance writing. In 1973 Mitchell was hired by the Massachusetts Audubon Society and in 1980 founded and edited the Society’s award-winning journal Sanctuary. Mitchell’s first book, Ceremonial Time: Fifteen Thousand Years on One Square Mile, was published in 1984 and went on to become something of a cult classic, thanks partly to his inclusion of Native American history in the narrative. This was followed by a series of books collected together as The Scratch Flat Chronicles. The books focus on Mitchell’s continuing fascination with the idea of place and time and the interrelationship between human culture and nature. Other books deal with travel and gardens, and a memoir, The Rose Café, the story of Mitchell's sojourn working in Corsica as a young man during the Algerian War. In 2005, he published Looking for Mr. Gilbert, his account of his discovery of the glass plate negatives and life of Robert A. Gilbert, the first African American landscape photographer. Mitchell received a number of awards for the body of his work, including travel grants, and an honorary doctorate from Fitchburg State University. In 2000 he won the New England Independent Bookseller’s Award for the body of his work, and was also recognized for his earlier work in book design and his Sanctuary essays. In 1993 he received the Outstanding Natural History Essay award from the John Burroughs Association for his essay \\"Of Time and the River.\\" Ceremonial Time was Editor's Choice at the NYT'S Book Review; most of his other works were favorably reviewed in the Times, the Boston Globe, Washington Post, L.A. Times, London Times Literary Supplement, etc. Six books based on the square mile of land featured in Ceremonial Time have been republished by the University of New England Press, collected together as The Scratch Flat Chronicles. Stray Leaves, a collection of his Sanctuary essays, was published in 2015.

P. Lovecraft, in November 1967. The songwriting is credited to band members George Edwards, Dave Michaels, and Tony Cavallari. Acting as the opening song on the second side of their debut LP, H. P. Lovecraft, it was the album's longest track, and an edited version was also released as the band's second single. The name and theme of the song derive directly from author H. P. Lovecraft's short story, \\"The White Ship\\". Despite its failure to chart nationally, it is widely considered to be H. P. Lovecraft's most accomplished piece, and helped establish the group, who were originally from Chicago, in the West Coast music scene. Background In 1967, H. P. Lovecraft spent much of their pre-recording time rehearsing intensively for several hours at a time. After a few months processing through personnel changes and rehearsal sessions, the band had both a relatively solidified line-up and personalized sound. With assistance from the band members, George Edwards, a creative force within the band, developed the haunting ambiance, and vocal harmonies featuring himself and Dave Michaels, almost total juxtapositions of one another, that made the band synonymous with the psychedelic music scene. Michaels, a classically-trained musician, was a standout for his four-octave span which blended in harmonies reminiscent of Jefferson Airplane. The band finally commenced a tour within the Chicago area and, following the replacement of rhythm guitarist Tom Skidmore with Jerry McGeorge, furthered their development of what would become future tracks recorded in studio sessions. Recording In mid-1967, weeks after recruiting McGeorge, the band started recording at Universal Recording Studios in Chicago under the production of George Badonsky. \\"The White Ship\\" was composed by Edwards in between intermissions of recording, in a matter of just 15 minutes. Although the initial concept of the song and its melody were devised by Edwards, contributions were made by other band members and Edwards allowed joint writing credits to co-singer Michaels and guitarist Cavallari as a part of his idea of \\"communal sharing of the creative collaboration.\\" Michaels said that the initial version given to the band by Edwards and Badonsky was \\"instantly moulded into a new entity\\" by the band as a whole: \\"By itself, the baritone melody and chords are merely a bare-bones beginning. Adding the harmonies, the feedback effects on lead guitar, and conceiving the 'bolero' rhythm all came into being in a group setting...\\". Dunwich production company executive Bill Traut played a role in the song's recording, contributing the chiming of an 1811 ship's bell heard at the opening of the composition to add a perceived ghost-like experience. Recording of the track required more time than some of the group's other tracks, but, thanks to past rehearsals and the band's familiarity with the studio, the song was quickly produced, virtually live, on four-track. The song has been described as baroque in nature, for its harpsichord passages and droning feedback. \\"The White Ship\\" draws comparisons to that of the author H. P. Lovecraft's short story while retaining the psychedelic influences of the late 1960s. The band's musical version focuses on the wonderment of the journey of the white ship, and ignores the horrific conclusion experienced by the story's character, Basil Elton. A scholar of Lovecraft's writings and heritage, Gary Hill, describes the song as having \\"... a weird ambient tone that calls to mind both some of the descriptions of sonic oddness that Lovecraft himself described and also the psychedelic chemical influence so common to this musical genre. As it moves forward the cut begins to take on a slow moving, ballad like structure... The cut moves off into weird spacey jamming later that includes sounds that seem to convey an Eastern mystic tone, which would be somewhat in keeping with much of Lovecraft's writing...\\" Release In November 1967, \\"The White Ship\\" was released in the U.S. on the Philips label (catalog number, 40506). The song was already a favorite among the H.P. Lovecraft followers, which made its distribution a practical maneuver by the group. Initially, the single featured both an edited version of the song that was only two minutes and 58 seconds in length, and the complete version that extended to six and a half minutes. The original pressing was withdrawn, and in February 1968 a second single, featuring the completed version and \\"I've Been Wrong Before\\" as the B-side, was released in both the US and UK. The single failed to chart nationally; nevertheless, the song was solidified as a favorite on the underground circuit. The track also appeared on the album, H. P. Lovecraft, and the edited version was included on the 2005 compilation album, Dreams in the Witch House: The Complete Philips Recordings.

Under standard conditions, FePt NPs exist in the face-centered cubic phase but can change to a chemically ordered face-centered tetragonal phase as a result of thermal annealing. Currently there are many synthetic methods such as water-in-oil microemulsion, one-step thermal synthesis with metal precursors, and exchanged-coupled assembly for making FePt NPs.Hyie, K. M.(2010). “Synthesis of Iron-Platinum Nanoparticles in Water-in-Oil Microemulsions for High-Density Storage Media Application”. 1-9. An important property of FePt NPs is their superparamagnetic character below 10 nanometers. The superparamagnetism of FePt NPs has made them attractive candidates to be used as MRI/CT scanning agents and a high-density recording material. Properties The various properties of iron-platinum nanoparticles allow them to function in multiple ways. In standard conditions, FePt NPs exist in the face-centered cubic phase with a 3 to 10 nanometer diameter. However, once heat is added the structure becomes a face-centered tetragonal and superparamagnetic. The nanoparticles become superparamagnetic because the addition of heat makes the particle smaller and iron rich, since it removes any impurities in the particles. As a result, the nanoparticles are used in CT or MRI scans.Iron-Platinum Nanoparticle Lattice Physical properties of FePt NPs Plant viruses, known as Cowpea mosaic virus and Tobacco mosaic virus, enlarge the average radius of the FePt NPs through direct mineralization. The virus template acts as a natural and benign method to monodisperse the nanoparticles up to 30 nanometers in diameter. The size increase of the bimetallic nanoparticles entitles it to a wider range of biological applications. Synthesis Platinum nanoparticles have a stronger chemical stability with the addition of iron, cobalt, or nickel. The platinum alloys also have a better detection range and catalytic activity than their counterpart. These magnetic metal additions to platinum reduce the overall sensitivity to oxidation while maintaining the desirable magnetic properties. Combined, FePt nanoparticles are synthesized for medicinal applications. One method of synthesis uses incident laser technology to irradiate solutions containing iron and platinum to combine the two alloys. A laser beam is emitted onto a 4:1 mixture of iron (III) acetylacetonate and platinum (II) acetylacetonate dissolved in methanol. The black precipitates are then washed and dried on silicon substrates to be characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction. Synthesis of Iron-Platinum Nanoparticles An alternative method of synthesis involves the coreduction of chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) and iron (II) chloride in water-in-oil microemulsions. In this process, the normal face- centered cubic structure is transformed to a face-centered tetragonal configuration, offering a higher density product useful for many storage media applications. Applications FePt NPs are promising materials for ultra-high density magnetic recording media due to their high coercivity. Higher coercivity indicates the material cannot be demagnetized easily. After annealing at 700 °C, the film can have up to 14KOe coercivity compared to common hard drives that have 5KOe coercivity.And nanoparticles have been grown with coercivities up to 37 kOe. FePt Coercivity Due to their superparamagnetism and controllable shape, size, and surface, iron-platinum nanoparticles have great potential for advancing medicine in many fields, including imagining, pathogen detection, and targeted cancer therapy. The NPs can be conjugated with antibodies for tissue-specific delivery, providing a systematic way to customize for either technology. FePt NPs are compatible for CT scans because of their strong ability to absorb x-rays.Page for X-Ray Mass Attenuation Coefficients for Pt. . FePt NPs also provide a non-toxic, more persistent alternative to iodinated molecules that are harmful to the kidney and survive in the body for only a short time. The superparamagnetic properties of the nanoparticles and the systematic method for conjugating ligands to the FePt surface makes them viable vehicles for detection of pathogens such as gram-positive bacteria. Antibodies for the bacteria conjugated to the FePt NP bind to the bacteria and magnetic dipoles are used to detect the FePt NP-bacteria conjugate. By attaching peptides to the surface of the face-centered cubic FePt NPs, cytotoxic iron can be delivered to specific locations and taken up with high selectivity.

The first railway project of Derbyshire civil engineer Benjamin Outram (1764–1805), the line was originally a horse-drawn and gravity-driven plateway, a form of tramway that Outram popularised. Unlike modern edgeways, where flanges on the wheel guide it along the track, plateways used \\"L\\" shaped rails where a flange on the rail guided the wheels. The line was constructed in 1793, with the construction of Fritchley Tunnel, now believed to be the world's oldest railway tunnel, being required to go under a road junction at Fritchley. A steam locomotive using a walking mechanism, known as the Steam Horse locomotive, was trialled on the line in 1813. In the 1840s, upgrading took place to accommodate steam locomotives, and part of the original line was moved. The railway remained in use until 1933.

Scott (1838–1910) by Gutzon Borglum, sometimes called Harvey Scott or Harvey W. Scott, was installed on Mount Tabor in Portland, Oregon, United States, until being toppled in October 2020. Modeled in 1930 and sculpted in 1933, the statue is among Borglum's final works and was donated by Scott's family. The memorial's dedication ceremony was attended by 3,000 people, including Governor Julius Meier, Portland mayor Joseph K. Carson, and Chester Harvey Rowell, as well as members of Scott's family, who created a maintenance fund during the 1940s. The statue has been administered by the City of Portland's Bureau of Parks and Recreation, and later the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the Regional Arts & Culture Council. The sculpture has been vandalized multiple times and has been featured in many Portland guides as a feature of Mount Tabor. Description Gutzon Borglum's two-ton bronze statue depicts a \\"scowling\\" Harvey W. Scott (1838–1910), an American pioneer and long-time editor of The Oregonian newspaper, wearing a knee-length coat and pointing his extended right arm westward toward Downtown Portland and the future. The memorial is installed in Mount Tabor Park, a city park on Mount Tabor, a dormant volcano in southeast Portland's eponymous neighborhood. The statue of Scott is displayed on the summit's southern side and faces southeast, toward Mount Scott; the \\"towering\\" statue sits on a basalt terrace with two concrete benches and steps. It measures approximately , and has a granite base measuring approximately . An inscription of the plinth's side edge reads; and its back edge bears the inscription; . The front of the base reads: . History The statue of Scott is among Borglum's final works; it was modeled in Borglum's studio in 1930 while he was also working on Mount Rushmore, South Dakota, and sculpted in 1933. It was gifted by Scott's wife Margaret, who left a $20,000 bequest upon her death in 1925, and other family members. In 1928, a resolution accepting a statue was presented to city council, and Leslie M. Scott confirmed six installation sites were being considered, including Mount Scott Park, the North and South Park Blocks, Terwilliger Boulevard, and Washington Park. On August 31, The Oregonian said Borglum planned to complete and install the work \\"within a year\\"; once finished, the design or a model would be inspected by the council, who would help determine an appropriate site. Leslie Scott and Ambrose B. Scott served as executors of the estate, and were tasked with presenting the statue to Portland. Construction and site selection Borglum and Portland's arts commission selected Mount Tabor, a dormant volcano seen here between Downtown Portland and Mount Hood, as the memorial's installation site The Scott family selected Borglum to complete the memorial, and the monument's site was chosen by the sculptor and the city's arts commission. Borglum selected the location in 1928 during a visit to Portland with his son Lincoln as guests of Leslie Scott and Colonel A. E. Clark; Borglum believed the city had many suitable sites for the monument and selected Mount Tabor as \\"... the most poetic, the most beautiful of all\\". During his visit, he told The Oregonian: The newly-formed arts commission approved the dormant volcano's south slope as the installation site in May 1930. In October, Leslie Scott confirmed the statue would be larger than the original design and The Oregonian reported May 1931 as the planned unveiling date. By then, Borglum had spent three months creating the clay model from which casts in plaster were made, following a series of clay models. The molds were shipped to Chicago to be filled with bronze. Boglum was assisted by Ivan Houser, and the sculpture was cast by New York's Kunst Foundry. The Oregonian also described plans for the monument's pedestal and base: Inscriptions on the base When the statue arrived in Portland on April 10, 1931, work on the construction of a temporary wooden base had already started. Several days later, the sculpture was displayed on the wooden structure at Mount Tabor's summit to allow arts commission members to finalize the design for the permanent granite base. The statue's exact placement and orientation were determined in February 1932 by the arts commission, members of Oregon's American Institute of Architects chapter, and Leslie Scott, who spent hours testing options. Two temporary bases were used while final placement decisions were made. Dedication and subsequent maintenance The monument arrived in July 1933 and was dedicated at an \\"impressive\\" ceremony that was attended by 3,000 people, including \\"numerous out-of-town notables\\". Speakers included Governor Julius Meier, San Francisco Chronicle editor Chester Harvey Rowell, and Joseph Schafer, the superintendent of the Wisconsin Historical Society, who described Scott's impact on the Pacific Northwest. Leslie Scott formally presented the statue, which was unveiled by Scott's granddaughter Elizabeth and received by mayor Joseph K. Carson. Clark served as the program's general chairman and an invocation was delivered by J. Whitcomb Brougher, pastor of Boston's Tremont Temple Baptist church. Also in attendance were members of Scott's family, who in the 1940s created the Scott Statue Memorial Fund with $5,000 to be used for future maintenance. In 1953, the statue was placed into temporary storage while the original pedestal, which had developed a crack, was replaced with a new bronze one. The work was surveyed and deemed \\"well maintained\\" by the Smithsonian Institution's \\"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\\" program in 1993, when the statue was administered by the City of Portland's Bureau of Parks and Recreation. The sculpture was later administered by the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the Regional Arts & Culture Council (RACC). In 2010, RACC oversaw an $8,000 restoration of the monument that was partly funded by the Oregon Cultural Trust. Vandalism The statue, toppled in October 2020 The statue was vandalized in May 2019 and graffiti removal was required. In November the same year, the artwork was again vandalized by an unknown perpetrator, who wrote \\"No Thanks Land\\" and \\"Chinook Land\\" in red paint. The statue was toppled in October 2020, following a series of statue removals in Portland during the George Floyd protests. Earlier in the year, demonstrators toppled statues of Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, and the statue of Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, Rough Rider were toppled during the Indigenous Peoples Day of Rage (October 11). Reception In 1931, The Oregonian said Scott is depicted with a \\"powerful pose, symbolizing the idea of the man of vision\\", and Leslie Scott was quoted as saying, \\"Borglum has done a fine piece of modeling, and I think our people here will value it both as a work of art and as a good standing portrait\\". The newspaper's Janet Moore described the statue as \\"heroic\\" in 1951 and wrote, \\"Portland is fortunate to possess this excellent specimen of Borglum's work\\". In 1965, John Painter Jr. of The Oregonian called the statue \\"dramatic\\" and said most Portland residents were unfamiliar with the \\"dilemma\\" over the artwork's installation site. In his \\"fascinating history of 25 Portland public-art gems\\" (2017), the newspaper's Douglas Perry said the sculpture \\"is further proof that Borglum liked to think big\\", with Scott \\"[having] the stance and look of a radical politician\\".

Briefly in the running to be the territorial capital of Kansas, it was located roughly one mile away from Centropolis. Today, hardly anything remains at the original site. Location Minneola was located roughly one mile east of Centropolis. Today, the site rests on both the north and south sides of Stafford Road, between Kentucky and Iowa Roads. The site is currently on private property, and in 1988 consisted of \\"little more than a few ruins and half a dozen farms.\\" History The ghost town can trace its origins to the earlier settlement of St. Bernard, founded in 1855. The town's postmaster, J. M. Bernard, was pro-slavery, and he angered many of the men in the area, who had anti-slavery leanings. Eventually, after Bernard was convinced to leave the settlement, St. Bernard developed into Minneola. At this time, Minneola became the chief rival of nearby Centropolis, as both were hoping to be the newly appointed territorial capital of Kansas. After Kansas free-state voters overcame the pro-slavery faction in 1857, the government voted against naming Centropolis as the capital of Kansas, since the town had pro-slavery leanings. However, the newly free-state government still wished to move the territorial capital from Lecompton, and so the legislature convened at Lawrence to decide a new location. Perry Fullera man who had been successful in establishing Centropolis as a cityand several associates purchased 14 quarter sections of farm land near Minneola, hoping to expand the small town into the future capital. Around this time, Centropolis's newspaper, the Kansas Leader was brought into Minneola, and renamed to the Minneola Statesman. Bribing the legislature with free town stock and land lots, Fuller was successfully able to get his town voted as the new capital on February 10, 1858. However, Kansas territorial governor James W. Denver vetoed this choice. Fuller appealed to Jeremiah S. Black, Attorney General of the United States, who ruled that the legislative bill had been a violation of U.S. statues, and was therefore invalid. Despite this, the legislature voted to meet at Minneola on March 223, 1858 to draft up a new constitution. Following this bill, work began on Minneola, and several buildings were constructed, including a potential governor's house, and a seven-story hotel. The city was also planned to be a hub for rail lines. However, once the legislature convened at the new town, they quickly moved to adjourn to Leavenworth. A later court ruling officially judged the legislative act establishing Minneola as the capital void. The town—despite being bereft of its chance as a capital—still managed to be prosperous for a few years, largely due to the promise of coming railroads. It even briefly served as the county seat. However, after a destructive drought, the city was soon dismantled. Eventually, the Statesman, was suspended and some buildings were carted off elsewhere; for instance, the proposed legislative hall was moved to Ottawa in 1864, where it served a variety of purposes until it was relocated for a second time and burned. Other buildings were simply destroyed. Today, hardly anything identifiable remains.

He was going to be in 3rd place, but because of this problem he finished in 20th place, losing $44,175 in prize money. In 2017 Brent withdrew from the Yukon Quest 1000 mile race, at a checkpoint, he also withdrew, prior to the race from the Iditarod. Focus is on health of dogs and kennel.

The plot follows Mary Shelley's first love and her romantic relationship with the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, which inspired her to write her 1818 novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. An international co-production, the film stars Elle Fanning as Shelley, with Maisie Williams, Douglas Booth, Bel Powley, and Ben Hardy in supporting roles. The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2017. It was released in the United States on May 25, 2018, by IFC Films, and in the United Kingdom on July 6, 2018, by Curzon Artificial Eye. Plot Mary Godwin was the daughter of the pioneering feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft and her husband, the publisher and political philosopher William Godwin. Mary Wollstonecraft had died shortly after giving birth, and when the film opens 16 years later Mary Godwin is living with her father, her stepmother (with whom she has a strained relationship), and her stepsister and close confidante Claire Clairmont. On an extended visit to Scotland, Mary meets and falls in love with the radical and unconventional poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, who is already married. The couple elope, taking Claire with them. Shelley has little money of his own, but borrows against his wealthy father's estate to set themselves up in lavish style in Bloomsbury. At a dinner party, Shelley flirts with Claire, and Mary is propositioned by one of Shelley's friends. When she complains, Shelley tells her that in his view lovers should be free. He wants her to take other partners, and demands the same freedom for himself. He calls her a hypocrite, and she expresses her disappointment in him. Later, Mary, Claire and Shelley attend a public display of galvanism in which a dead frog is made to twitch by the application of electricity. Also in the audience is the handsome and famous poet Lord Byron. Claire introduces herself, and is smitten. One night, Shelley's creditors arrive unexpectedly, and Mary, Claire and Shelley have to flee. They take up cheap lodgings. Mary gives birth, but her baby does not survive for long. Claire announces that she is pregnant by Byron, and that he has invited them all to stay with him at a villa near Geneva. When they arrive, Byron makes it clear that the \\"invitation\\" is little more than Claire's wishful thinking. He asks them to stay in any event. The poor weather keeps them indoors for days, and one evening Byron challenges the group to write a ghost story, a task which captures Mary's imagination and causes her to dream of galvanism. A message arrives for Shelley informing him that his wife has just drowned herself. Throughout the visit, Byron treats Claire with increasing contempt. She loses patience and confronts him, but he laughingly responds that his affair with her was a mere dalliance, and that he has no interest in her. He says that he will provide financially for her baby, but nothing more. The three return to their lodgings in England, and Mary starts to write a novel, Frankenstein. The stresses drive Mary and Shelley apart. No publisher will take the work under Mary's name as it is considered unsuitable subject-matter for a lady, but with the addition of a foreword by Shelley it is eventually accepted for anonymous publication. The book is a success, with Shelley initially being given the credit until he publicly discloses the name of the true author. The couple reconnect. Mary's father arranges for a second publication of her novel under her own name, ensuring that she derives an income from it. In the last scene of the film Mary, dressed in black, is seen walking with a young son. An afterword explains that Mary and Shelley had married, and that they stayed together until Shelley's death at the age of 29. Mary never married again.

Using the tagline “a 90s CRPG in every way but the release date”, The game resembles several classic games such as Fallout, Baldur's Gate, and Darklands. The game is notable for being \\"brutally old- school\\", lacking several features seen in modern RPGs such as introductory or tutorial levels, automatically updated journals and quest-markers. It also has a distinct pixelated graphics style. The game uses the Unity Technologies' Unity engine. In Serpent of the Staglands, you assume the role of Necholai, a lesser God who has descended to earth to take part in a festival in his honor. However, once the festivities are over, some unseen force prevents you from leaving your mortal form and returning to your home. Therefore, you disguise yourself as a spice merchant, trying to move unnoticed throughout the land in an endeavor to find out who is blocking your passage to the astral planes to finally reclaim your immortality. The game was the subject of a successful Kickstarter campaign raising $28,058 from 1,092 backers. It was released via the Whalenought website as well as GOG.com, Steam and Humble Store on 28 May 2015. Josh Sawyer and Feargus Urquhart from Obsidian Entertainment were among the backers. An expansion pack is currently under development. Despite initially being \\"almost completely ignored by the specialized press\\", favorable reviews and impressions are starting to appear.  Gameplay  The game features a classless role-playing system reminiscent of the SPECIAL system used in Fallout. The player is free to create builds using any combination of the magic, combat and aptitude skills available. You create your character at the start of the game, and might optionally create up the five more. Alternatively, you recruit companions you meet in the game world. A noteworthy feature is the ability to bind the souls of these companions to the will of the player character, making sure that they will not leave your party later on. Similarly reminiscent of Fallout, the game allows open world sandbox exploration, meaning that the player is free to move about the map as he chooses and solve quests in any order desired. The game also features a non- linear storyline, with multiple endings according to the choices made by the player. Combat has been noted by reviewers to be \\"especially brutal\\". It uses real-time with pause, as popularized by Infinity Engine games such as Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, as well as the more recent Pillars of Eternity. The player is encouraged to pause often to take tactical decisions, using the abilities of the different party members. While one reviewer noted that he died \\"repeatedly despite learning how to manage combat\\", he nevertheless described combat as \\"strategic\\" and \\"fun\\".  Setting  Serpent in the Staglands takes place in the world of Vol. Despite being a fantasy world, it is inspired by the actual Bronze Age and heavily influenced by medieval Transylvania. Despite the presence of classic fantasy elements such as magic, the game is known for its gritty, realistic and dark tone. This makes many gamers draw parallels to Darklands. \\"Featuring a chosen party of five, you take the role of Necholai, a minor god of a celestial body, who descends to the Staglands for a moonlit festival only to find his way home blocked and immortality slipping out of his grasp. Seeking answers and aid, he takes on a mortal body and the guise of a traveling Spicer\\".  Development  Serpent in the Staglands was developed by Whalenought Studios, which is a husband-and- wife team consisting of Joe and Hannah. Joe takes care of art and animation duties, while Hannah is responsible for programming and writing. While based in Chicago during development, the company moved to Seattle after its release. The initial game design for Serpent in the Staglands started in winter 2013. The Kickstarter campaign ran over a 30-day period from 27 March 2014 until 26 April 2014. It exceeded the initial $10,000 funding goal, allowing for several streach goals to be reached including the expansion pack. Serpent in the Staglands was created using Unity 3D. Parts of the Kickstarter funds went towards buying Unity 3D Pro, which featured more efficient path finding technology and optimized lighting solutions. Joe and Hannah appeared on Matt Chat episodes 284-286 to discuss the making the game.  Release  The initial planned release date was winter 2014. The game was postponed until 28 May 2015, however, to allow for additional bug testing and polish.  Expansion pack  As announced during the Kickstarter campaign, an expansion to the game is currently in development. It will be made available for free to those who purchased the game, either prior or subsequent to the Kickstarter campaign. Reception While Serpent in the Staglands was initially \\"almost completely ignored by the specialized press\\" at the time of release, reviews and impressions from (mainly smaller) gaming sites have since appeared. Niche Gamer awarded the game 8/10. He finds that \\"deep below all of that frustration is an amazing RPG that deserves to be played\\". He highlights the main positive points as the story and the freedom when forming a party. He mentions the general difficulty of the game, saying \\"like any good European CRPG, Staglands isn’t looking to hold your hand or babysit you\\". Combat is \\"especially brutal\\" with \\"no scaling or helpful placement of adequately leveled enemies\\". He notes that the game requires some time to get into, speaking of a \\"“five hour wall” that surrounds the game, since the early going is so rough that you need to have almost superhuman patience to overcome it\\". Noting the weaker points of the game, he states that there are \\"some incredibly ancient gameplay conventions that even I found intolerable at times\\", notably criticizing the lack of features on the journal function and \\"not being able to resurrect fallen allies, not getting any clues as to whether killing an NPC will ruin your quest, and not being told if an enemy requires a certain level of weapon to do damage against it\\". True PC Gaming lauds the variety of character creation options, emphasizing that \\"there’s a nice selection of races and subcultures to pick from, with unique bonuses attached to each. These choices are supplied with a staggering amount of back history for both alike\\". He also notes that \\"Serpent in the Staglands is one gorgeous game\\", and that \\"the music composition is fantastic and perfectly suits both the feel and art style of the game\\". He is critical about the user interface, however, stating that the \\"old fashioned HUD tries to fit a large number of buttons so close together that it often confused me what each one did, even after many times using them\\" and misses the option to compare items. He concludes; \\"I’ve played some difficult games in my time, but I can’t remember any that left my lead character crumpled in a bloody heap on the cold ground so frequently as Serpent in the Staglands. It’s quite a task to nail down a solid conclusion about this game, as I feel like the overall enjoyment experienced will vary drastically based on the type of player. That being said, there’s much to be appreciated by all audiences, and I wholeheartedly recommend traditional RPG fans to buy this game now\\". Richard Cobbett describes the game in an article for Rock, Paper, Shotgun. He finds that \\"the needlessly frustrating opening\\" is to the game's detriment because stat descriptions \\"largely assumes you’re coming to the game from things like Dungeons and Dragons\\". He goes on to say that \\"this game painfully, desperately needs a Getting Started type guide. There’s a manual, which is not optional, but even that is a weak introduction\\". To the game's credit, he goes on to say that \\"the frustrating/good thing is that behind all of this waits a surprisingly good RPG. It’s bursting with carefully designed areas and clever ideas, as well some really fun gimmicks. You can start with just yourself, or use your god powers to create a few extra empty shells to back you up until you find suitable NPCs to fill slots. When they’re recruited, you can either take them warts and all or use your power to just straight up steal their souls, removing their tiresome free will\\". In conclusion, he finds that \\"there’s a lot of really good stuff here, and the game is mostly excellent, but the path to actually getting into the damn thing is far more frustrating than it is rewarding. Once past it, the amount of freedom it offers in everything from character builds to your path around an open world designed to reward exploration is all great, and knowing the carrot is there does help. Even so, do be sure you have the dedication to keep chasing it while being brutally beaten with the stick\\". Finally, the game was also reviewed by two Greek gaming sites, Greek Gamer and Ragequit.gr. The latter awarded the game 90/100.

The series is directed by Eiichi Sato, with character designs by Takeshi Mamezuka. The series' opening theme was composed by Yoko Kanno and performed by May'n. The series began airing in July 2015. In North America, Funimation simulcasted the anime as it aired in Japan. The series was added to the Crunchyroll catalog on June 15, 2017. This series follows an entirely new storyline, unrelated to the previous entries in the franchise. Plot Twelve thousand years ago, human voices had defined the true nature of all things, yet the invention of text changed the status quo which created a \\"Logos World\\" between the realities of voice and the truth. Up until the modern day, advancements of civilizations have made the Logos World too big to control texts down to their very concept. Seeking to upset this fragile balance is a mogul and sorcerer named Sōgon Kenzaki, who creates monsters called the MJBK (Menace of Japanese with Biological Kinetic energy) who threaten the modern society. To counter the MJBK, a group of young people blessed with the power of \\"Verbalism\\" is assembled by the organization DEAVA (Division of EArth Verbalism Ability) to pilot the vector machines, which are used to form the mechas dubbed \\"Aquarions\\", and among them, a boy and self-proclaimed savior named Akira Kaibuki living in Asagaya. Characters Verbalism Club ; : :The main protagonist, Akira is a stoic and level-headed youngster who behaves according to his belief that he is bent into become a \\"savior\\", although not even he remembers why or when he started doing so. He is the grandson of a famous calligrapher and pilots the all-around, red-colored Vector-01, which he nicknames as \\"Savior-go\\". After his vector is destroyed, he obtains another ancient vector known as Vector-ga, far increasing his powers. ; : :Trained since childhood to be Subete's partner, she grew up blindly following Sōgon's teachings until her first sortie when she is forced to combine with Akira and defeat the M.J.B.K. she was supposed to protect. After being held prisoner by DEAVA, she obtains a chance to return to NESTA, but Sōgon instead instructs her to pretend that she switched sides in order to investigate Akira further. However, she eventually learns to think by herself and joins forces with Akira and the others against Sōgon to defeat him instead. She pilots the purple- colored Vector-02, focused on air superiority. :She is a human created from Verbalism Power with the purpose of awakening the Aquarion Logos and destroy the world. She met Akira once when they were children and he promised her to become the savior who would save the world so Maia was allowed to live on. ; : :A shy girl who can barely talk, Kokone lost her ability to talk with confidence after a tragic event from her childhood. She aims to become an actress and joined the Verbalism Club in order to improve her speech and eventually falls in love with Akira, but views Maia as a rival, believing that she is also infatuated on him as well while she was just following him around by Sōgon's orders. She pilots the white-colored Vector-03, specialized in enemy disruption and rear support. ; : :A cool-headed young man who aims to become a politician like his late father, and just like Tsutomu, joined the Verbalism Club seeking to improve his speech for his own sake, and his will to develop detailed strategies before acting usually puts him at odds with Akira, who usually acts without much thinking. He pilots the blue-colored Vector-05, focused on mobility and high speed. ; : :A young aspiring comedian whose older brother is a famous comedian himself, and despite knowing that he is not near as talented as him, he seeks his own form of comedy, performing unusual sketches that so far earned him only one avid fan. He joined the Verbalism Club seeking to make use of the training against the M.J.B.K. to improve his comedy skills, and pilots the attack-oriented, yellow-colored Vector-04, specialized in hit and run tactics. ; : :The youngest member of the team, Karan is a little girl who was aiming to become an idol and joined the Verbalism Club seeking support for her career, until Akira realizes that she wanted to be an idol just to please her mother's selfish desires and when he helped them reconcile, she started pursuing her true dream, which is to become a voice actor. She pilots the pink-colored Vector-06, specialized in reconnaissance and ambush. DEAVA ; : :Sakurako was Sōgon's secretary until realizing the true nature of his plans, thus she betrays him and defects to the Japanese Government taking the Vectors and several other equipment from NESTA which she uses to establish DEAVA. Since then she is DEAVA's chief of operations, monitoring and instructing the members of the Verbalism Club during battles. She also manages the Shirobaco Maid Café which serves as a front for DEAVA's headquarters and as a place for Akira and the others to run several activities to train their Verbalism skills. ; : :Sakurako's aid who works at DEAVA. She was scouted at first to be part of the Verbalism Club, but later it was revealed that she has no Verbaism power at all, which is a strange fact itself as it is said that every individual has some kind of Verbalism on itself, albeit weak. Later it is revealed that said trait was a Verbalism power in itself, which was used to break free those under control of Subete's Verbalism skills. She also becomes Tsutomu's girlfriend and then assumes command of Vector-04 after his death. ; : :Sakurako's right hand man who also works as Shirobaco's cook. NESTA ; : :The heir of NESTA Communications and Sōgon Kenzaki's son, he always tried to please his father to no avail. Upon giving up trying to find emotional support on him, he started trying to bond with Maia, the partner he was assigned to defend the MJBK's with. However, when Maia was forced to join DEAVA's side, he started desperately looking for a way to bring her back to his side by all means possible, including developing a dangerous method of increasing his powers by fusing his black-colored Vector-00 with the MJBK's themselves, risking his own body in the process. In the final battle against Sōgon, Subete is ultimately rejected by Maia, who disapproves his behavior. He later reappears, having learned the powers of the Book of Verbalism from his father to increase his power, and determined to destroy the world as Akira's self-proclaimed nemesis. ; : :The CEO of NESTA Communications. He was the major antagonist for the first half of the series, creating MJBK's to destroy the written culture, and by consequence, the world in order to have it start over again. He claims that with the advent of Internet, the use of words was banalized to the point of doing more harm than good to society, thus it would lead to its eventual downfall. He is eventually stopped and defeated by the Verbalism Club in a final battle inside the Logos World and crushed to his death by a falling boulder. ; : :NESTA's chief researcher who developed the Vectors and remained loyal to Sōgon after Sakurako's betrayal. After Sōgon's death, he remains working at NESTA, now supporting Subete. MJBK The minions of Sōgon, the MJBK are monsters formed from the Logos World upon a text receiving his mystical syringes spawned from his book of magic. Upon formation the text they form in the real world will dissipate following their birth before using their meaning to cause physical destruction. Upon reaching full power the MJBK will erase the concept of their meaning in the collective minds of humanity, irreparably damaging their ability to communicate and think. *Maki: Appears in episode 1.

In 2010, Serene Oasis was set up at 2A Kwun Tong Road in Choi Hung. And up to May 2013, around 850 patients have their mental conditions improved by the therapeutic services. What’s more, around 270 people had received certification of horticultural therapy through the training programmes. Features Serene Oasis advocates green life in Hong Kong. It aims to enable people to appreciate the greenness of nature and experience the fun of planting in the urban city. Meanwhile, the site was regarded as a pioneer to promote horticultural therapy, which is a new type of treatment from the developed countries. Through creating experiences and activities related to nature, horticultural therapy has a positive impact on patients’ recovery from mental or physical problems. Horticultural therapy's design for clients In the horticultural therapy, Serene Oasis owned around 100 types of plants, which are used to shape a natural environment for the enhancement of clients' sensual experience. With the immersion in nature using human's five senses, it is expected that the participants can acquire a sense of calm and comfort in the process.Blend of greenness and social services For instance, the sound of trickle renders an aural experience of the flowing water; the vanilla may stimulate the sense of touch and smell when its light fragrance flows into the lungs. Moreover, the sense of taste may also be stimulated with plants like passion fruits. All these are to cultivate a peaceful mind for patients. Concepts Plants have life just like human beings. Generally speaking, their life processes include seed germination, stem elongation, flower development and maturity, which also require human effort to look after. This treatmentProgramme DesignProgramme Design focuses on the interaction between people and plants. From the stage of sowing, nurturing, irrigation to growth, from the sapling to the well-developed form, participants are given a chance to witness the plants' growth and thus attain a sense of achievement. Furthermore, participants can acquire the knowledge regarding the life cycle of plants and know more about farming. Operation Funding Recently, Serene Oasis is basically relying on four sources of capital for operation. The sources include revenuesFinancial Run from some of the activities it organizes, sponsorships from the business community, donation from the public, as well as the monetary support from some regular donors. Challenges Though with the generous support from various parties, Serene Oasis faced several challenges in its operation and future development. First, it has only a limited number of staff to manage the enormous site. Therefore, it is facing a shortage of workers. In light of this, the site and organization organized training programmes to recruit volunteers. The duties of the volunteers include taking care of the growing plants, facilitating the horticultural therapy and teaching some DIY handcraft workshops etc. Serene Oasis requires their volunteers to be keen on farming, helpful, and to be willing to share his/her own knowledge and skills with other community members, so that they can help reduce the burden of the existing staff. On top of the trainingTraining for volunteers. SereneOasis.com programmes, as a social organization, Serene Oasis also recruited volunteersCorporate voluntary services SereneOasis.com from the collaborative projects with several popular corporations centering their businesses in Hong Kong, such as Bossini and Town Gas. From these collaborations, not only the site can receive assistance, but the corporations may also enhance the cohesion of their labours. Besides recruiting volunteers to complete the necessary work, experts were also being invited to the site and help with the technical part of the operation. For example, when Serene Oasis was still under its early stage of development, professors from the Biology field went to give advice on the growth of plants, and experts from the architecture field were invited to help with the design and construction of the small farmlands. Therefore, with the assistance from the members in the community, Serene Oasis can generally maintain its operation without excessive monetary burden. The second factor restricting the development of Serene Oasis is the limitation of land utilization. Due to the fact that the urban land is limited, it is necessary to make an efficient disposition of land. Although the land in Serene Oasis is already being highly utilized, it is not yet enough for further developing their activities in order to expand the range of social services. The third one is the lack of experts specializing in horticultural therapy. Since this therapy is still a rather new developing type of treatment in Hong Kong, there are not so many specialists in this field. As a results, it is difficult for Serene Oasis to have more professionals and improve the efficiency of their therapy. Transportation Serene Oasis is west to, and several minutes’ walk from, the A2 exit of the Choi Hung Station. An underpass outside the station is available for steps to Serene Oasis. It is locatedHow to get to Serene Oasis. SereneOasis.com just between the underpass and the Richland Gardens.

She was one of the first feminists and influenced the generation of young women who fueled the first wave of feminism in Mexico. Biography Rita Cetina Gutiérrez was born 22 May 1846 in Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico to Colonel Don Pedro Cetina and Jacoba Gutiérrez. Cetina's father was murdered when she was 14 and a benefactor assisted her in attaining her education. She studied under two noted scholars from Cuba, Domingo Laureano Paz and Félix Ramos y Duarte, who were living in Mérida. She wrote poetry from about 1860 which was published in many local journals and newspapers, sometimes using the pen name Cristabela. Typical themes were love, a desire for justice, education and patriotism. With the support of Gertrudis Tenorio Zavala and Cristina Farfán, on 3 May 1870 Cetina opened La Siempreviva (Everlasting), an institution consisting of Mexico's first secular school for poor girls as well as an art college for young women. She established simultaneously a scientific and literary society and a newspaper of the same name, specifically written for ladies and young women. Teaching at the girls school covered reading, grammar and geography, as in other girls schools of the period, but surprisingly it also included religious history, reflecting Cetina's own faith. The curriculum of the art college included literature, drawing, reciting, music (piano) and theater. In addition to publishing her own paper, Cetina was listed as an editor of the newspaper El Federalista (The Federalist). She rejected the idea that women's studies should include only domestic skills and offered a curriculum including astronomy, constitutional law, geometry, geography, history, and mathematics. As well as discussions on children, \\"the double standard\\", female sexuality, love, and marriage. Seven years after founding her school, the Instituto Literario de Niñas (ILN) (Literary Institute for Girls) was created by Governor Manuel Cepeda Peraza and Cetina was asked to become its Director. She agreed because the school offered women the opportunity to have both secondary education and teacher's training in a normal school. La Siempreviva remained open operating as a private school until it merged with the ILN in 1886. Cetina's lasting legacy and contributions to the feminist movement of Yucatán at the turn of the twentieth century, is clearly seen in some of the pupils she taught: Susana Betancourt Yucatecan representatives at the Pan-American Conference of Women in Baltimore in 1922; Elvia Carrillo Puerto elected as a Yucatán State Deputy in 1923; Raquel Dzib Cicero elected as a Yucatán State Deputy in 1923; Leonarda Gómez Blanco who served as Director of Education in both Campeche and Tlaxcala Beatríz Peniche Barrera elected as a Yucatán State Deputy in 1923; Gloria Mireya Rosado Yucatecan representatives at the Pan American Feminist Congress in Baltimore in 1922; Elena Torres founder of the first Montessori School in Mexico; Rosa Torre González first woman elected to any office in Mexico elected to the Mérida City Council in 1922; and Consuelo Zavala head of the organizing committee of the First Feminist Congress. Cetina retired in 1902 and died in Mérida on 11 October 1908.

Biography She was born in Peru in 1909 and died in New York City in 1943. She was educated in a convent, but continued her studies after leaving the convent. Marrying a well-to-do man, she left her girlhood home at Trujillo, Peru and moved near Lima. When her husband lost his fortune, she became a fashion editor of a bi-monthly magazine, the Illustracion Peruana, and then editor of a magazine for children. The small magazine met with unprecedented success, and she eventually tried writing original articles, and translating French and Italian novels for the daily papers. Pinillos never used her own name. \\"It would have hurt the papers and magazines,\\" she explained, \\"to have it known that the articles—except the fashion articles— were written by a woman, and besides, it was never done.\\" When the editor of Illustracion died, Pinillos took his place, editing the magazine for a year, but still secretly. Later the magazine was discontinued. Seeing no literary future for herself in her own country, Pinillos came to the United States— \\"where women could work'\\"—bringing with her a little daughter. Her work began in New York City with the Butterick Publishing Company, in the Spanish edition of their fashion sheet. She went on to do translations, both newspaper articles and pamphlets published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. She ten edited Revista del Mundo, the Spanish edition of The World's Work before she became editor of Inter America. She continued translating contemporary fiction into Spanish, including a translation of the five volumes of Frank Simonds' History of the World War (Historia de la guerra del mundo). She represented the American Association for International Conciliation at the Pan American Union.

The two end up having a one-night stand, only for Dante to reconcile with Lulu and Valerie briefly dates Lulu's ex-boyfriend Dillon Quartermaine (Robert Palmer Watkins). Storylines Looking for answers about Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary)'s mental state, his daughter Lulu (Emme Rylan) and his ex-wife Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot) go searching for his estranged older sister Pat, and find her daughter Valerie instead. As she is held hostage by a gun wielding Luke, Valerie tells them Pat is dead. Luke ties Valerie up and threatens to kill her when he finds out she lied about her mother being dead. They struggle over his gun and Luke escapes leaving Valerie unconscious and she is discovered by Lulu and her husband Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna). Valerie reveals that Pat is alive and living in a nursing home because she suffers from Multiple sclerosis and Luke has gone after her. Dante and Valerie find Pat (Dee Wallace) at her childhood home in Port Charles with the rest of the Spencers only for their reunion to be cut short when Pat suddenly passes away. Blaming Luke for her mother's death, Valerie tries to kill him, but Dante talks her down. Valerie temporarily moves in with Dante and Lulu, and she bonds with him over being raised by single moms. Lulu becomes insecure about their growing closeness though Valerie and Dante maintain they are just friends. Valerie moves in with Lulu's brother Nikolas (Tyler Christopher) to give them space. However, Dante and Valerie become even closer when she starts working for the police department as an administrative assistant. Meanwhile, Valerie bonds with her aunt Bobbie (Jacklyn Zeman) when Bobbie tells her about their childhood. Later, Aunt Bobbi will encourage Valerie to go after her cousin Lulu's husband Dante. Valerie also moves in with her cousin and Bobbie's daughter Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright). On Independence Day, Dante and Valerie end up sleeping together after a drunken Dante is mistakenly led to believe that Lulu is having an affair with her ex-boyfriend Dillon Quartermaine (Robert Palmer Watkins) while Valerie is grieving her mother. Valerie admits that she took advantage of a drunken Dante the morning after the tawdry one night stand. Dante and Lulu reconcile while Valerie agrees to keep quiet about the affair despite having feelings for him. Valerie later begins dating Dillon. Valerie clashes with Lulu's best friend Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms) who accuses her of going after Dante. They later reconcile and help Carly pick jewelry for her wedding. Valerie however is forced to leave the wedding early because she isn't feeling well. When Dante's father Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) gets shot, Valerie wants to comfort him and Dante's partner Detective Nathan West (Ryan Paevey) warns her to keep her distance. Nathan reveals that he knows about their tryst and calls her out about her feelings for Dante. He advises her to devote her attention to someone else and Valerie turns to Dillon who quickly calls her out on using him to cover her feelings for Dante. However, Dillon admits to using her to cover up his residual feelings for Lulu. They agree to keep each other's secrets and decide to remain friends. Valerie is shocked when Dante later confronts her believing she is pregnant, thanks to Nathan. Valerie clears up the misunderstanding and promises she has no residual feelings for Dante. Valerie later announces that she is starting the police academy. Valerie is blindsided when Dillon intentionally shows video footage of Valerie's confession at Lulu's Halloween Party publicly humiliating all involved. Valerie assures that she and Dante are over and blames Lulu for her and Dante's one night stand. After the revelation, Valerie goes to Lante's loft to comfort Dante—although she gives the excuse that her visit is talk to Lulu. Lulu returns to the loft to find Valerie and Dante sitting next to each other and assumes the affair is still on. Later, new police cadet Valerie gets paired with Dante on a stakeout. On Thanksgiving Day, Valerie drops off a pie for a distraught and grieving Dante who is spending the day alone having gotten separation papers from Lulu and has just signed them. Valerie again takes advantage of the situation to seduce Dante. The next morning, Lulu, who has decided to patch things up with her husband, shows up at the loft to find a fully clothed Dante and a towel-clad Valerie.

Valerie agrees to enter a secret hook-up relationship with Dante, after Dante tells Valeries that that is all he is capable of at the moment. After Christmas, Valerie asks Dante for another secret hook up, and Dante tells her that he is busy. When Valerie probes Dante, Dante admits that over the Christmas holidays, he and Lulu didn't fight so much. At this point, Valerie ends things with Dante, which produces a palpable expression of relief on Dante's face. Later after befriending the mysterious Greg (Brandon Barash), who helped repair her car when Valerie was stranded on the side of the road, Valerie meets up with him again, but this time Greg is having car trouble and asks Valerie for a ride. Greg then kidnaps her when Valerie realizes he is actually an escaped fugitive Johnny Zacchara. Johnny leaves Valerie trapped in an abandoned cabin that catches fire and she is rescued by Lulu. Valerie discovers that Johnny has been working on Lulu's behalf and exposes her to Dante. While she does not press charges, Valerie can't forgive Lulu for almost killing her. In February 2016, Valerie meets Curtis Ashford (Donnell Turner) and after a game of pool, he asks her out. However, their Valentine's Day date is interrupted by his sister-in-law Jordan who warns Valerie that he is trouble. Curtis confesses that he has struggled with drug addiction in the past but is now clean. On their next date, Valerie and Curtis bond over losing their mothers and later team up to win the Crimson magazine contest and split the $1000 cash prize. They share their first kiss and Curtis convinces her to agree to another date. In June 2016, Valerie graduates from the police academy and Curtis throws a surprise for Val and her fellow graduates. Development Scream queen Dee Wallace best known for her appearance in the 1982 Steven Spielberg film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial portrayed Valerie's late mother Pat Spencer whom Valerie spends most of her life caring for because of her illness. Casting and creation Brytni Sarpy originated the role of Valerie Spencer on March 20, 2015. Sarpy had auditioned for the series several times over the years. The actress first auditioned for the short lived role of Taylor DuBois in the spring of 2013. While Sarpy made it through the casting process, she was ultimately too old for the role of the 16-year-old Taylor. In late 2013, Sarpy auditioned for the role of Jordan Ashford—for which she was too young because Sarpy would have been playing mom to a teenager. However, Sarpy made an indelible impression on the casting department. Sarpy was sure she'd land in daytime because she had actually auditioned several times for NBC's Days of Our Lives. \\"I kind of knew it was going to be one or the other\\" the actress said to Soap Opera Digest. In January 2015 the series put out a casting call for a \\"beautiful,\\" \\"dynamic\\", and \\"charismatic\\" African American actress in her 20s for a contract role due begin taping in late February. When Sarpy returned to audition for the role of Valerie with casting director Mark Teschner despite the lack of information in the original casting call. Sarpy described the casting process for Valerie as \\"pretty quick\\" because within the next few days, she had a callback with some of the producers, including executive producer Frank Valentini. She then screen tested the following Monday and within \\"a week and a half,\\" Sarpy had booked the role making General Hospital the actress's first major professional gig. Sarpy admitted that finding the \\"right\\" roles had been difficult, \\"but the role of Valerie Spencer, was effortless for me.\\" Head writer Ron Carlivati explained that with the introduction of Valerie's mother Pat (Dee Wallace) as the long lost Spencer sibling, the writers questioned if a new character of that age could \\"have an ongoing purpose on the canvas?\\" And out of those discussions came the character of Valerie. Carlivati thought, \\"why go to all that trouble just to kill of Pat?\\" Valerie's survival after Pat's departure \\"made it more interesting to [the writers] and brought it into the present.\\" In December 2016, Sarpy was downgraded to recurring basis. In February 2019, it was announced that Sarpy had joined the cast of The Young and the Restless. On March 28, 2019, it was announced that Paulina Bugembe had been cast in the role of Valerie, and had already had her first day on-set; she made her first appearance on April 23, 2019. Characterization Sarpy explained that Valerie would \\"always\\" be defined by her relationship with her mother. While it wasn't originally scripted, Valerie's introduction immediately answers the question about her being biracial. Sarpy said \\"We felt it was important to answer the question of Valerie's mixed ethnicity head on.\\" During an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Sarpy revealed that she and Valerie actually have several similarities. Like Valerie, Sarpy also has a diverse ethnic background and was primarily raised by a single parent—her father, while Valerie was raised by her mother. Valerie is her mother's caretaker during her battle with Multiple sclerosis while Sarpy's father Mel suffers from Parkinson's disease. \\"The way Valerie took care of her mother, I definitely related to it.\\" Because of this, Valerie possess a certain \\"maternal quality.\\" Sarpy said her character's iconic heritage speaks for itself. \\"Valerie is a Spencer through and through.\\" She described Valerie as a \\"passionate\\" \\"go-getter\\" who \\"wears her heart on her sleeve.\\" Valerie has \\"hero qualities\\" and is a \\"good girl.\\" Valerie is a \\"fighter\\" Sarpy declared. She is very \\"sincere.\\" Sarpy further described Valerie as being \\"strong\\" and \\"courageous.\\" Sarpy also characterized Valerie as being very \\"conscientious.\\" \\"She's a moral character so she cares about what she's doing.\\" Though she loves her mom, Valerie didn't have much time to live her own life because she was devoted to Pat. Introduction The character's introduction is far from a gradual one but said the character brings a \\"new energy to the Spencer clan.\\" Legendary anti-hero Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary) has suffered a severe breakdown which his family has linked to his childhood which he never discusses. The Spencer family goes seeking out Luke's estranged older sister Pat Spencer—and instead find her daughter, Valerie—who is immediately thrust into the middle of the drama. Upon her introduction, Valerie struggles to find her place in Port Charles and in her family because it is all so unfamiliar to her and she doesn't have Pat by her side. Still suffering through the trauma of losing her mother, Valerie struggles to find her place in town and in the ranks of her iconic family because it is all so unfamiliar to her. \\"She's come in with quite a lot on her plate\\" Sarpy said. However, the circumstances of her introduction makes for a lot of \\"raw emotion and character development\\" Sarpy explained. Relationships After losing her mother, Valerie develops an immediate connection with Dante Falconeri (Zamprogna), who is married to her cousin Lulu (Rylan). Sarpy said that Dante and Valerie's relationship is \\"very nurturing\\" and he stands up for her in way that no one else does. They also share a kindred spirit because of them were raised by single mothers. Dante has a \\"soft spot\\" for her and Valerie needs really needs that when they first meet. Sarpy insisted that Valerie's intentions were pure. The series immediately hinted at the possibility of Dante and Valerie's relationship causing trouble for Dante and Lulu. The two eventually have a one-night stand and Sarpy said it \\"adds layers to her character\\" and makes for great drama. However, Dante and Valerie's relationship isn't \\"over sexualized\\" and they never intended to hurt anyone. Sarpy admitted that she saw the story coming because she auditioned opposite Dominic Zamprogna in the chemistry read. The actress explained that she was a bit \\"apprehensive\\" about Valerie's relationship with Dante which made her take it more seriously. \\"I think we made it very believable\\" Sarpy said. \\"This is all new terrain for her.\\" Because Valerie's life has been about her mother, \\"she's green to a lot of things\\" and she is bound to \\"make some mistakes\\" as she tries to develop new relationships. Sarpy credited Zamprogna with making her feel comfortable during the usually awkward filming process for the love scenes. In 2016, Sarpy admitted that Dante and Lulu's loft, where Valerie and Dante's affair occurred is her least favorite set to work on considering the history between the characters. \\"Ugh, just the idea of Valerie being Lulu's cousin makes it awkward!\\" Reception Sarpy received mostly negative feedback from fans on social media. The actress received a great deal of push back from fans. Carol Banks Weber of SoapHub initially disapproved of the writing for the biracial Valerie believing the writers had refused to tap into the character's full potential though Valerie was \\"clearly loaded with baggage\\" and could be \\"outrageous fodder in the hands of a creative, careful head scribe.\\" Instead, Weber had come to see Valerie as an annoyance because the writing hadn't provided a real reason for viewers to invest in the character. Weber felt the character at times would \\"turn on a dime\\" to fit the plot driven writing. However, Weber praised Sarpy for her portrayal of Valerie in scenes in which she discusses being racially profiled and praised Sarpy's chemistry with Dominic Zamprogna. By August 2015, Weber had completely changed her tune about Valerie strictly based on Sarpy's portrayal. Weber said, \\"no other GH newcomer comes as prepared to unleash an entire bio-pic on a bare-bone story.\\" She further praised the actress and said Sarpy \\"infuses Valerie, a Lante third wheel we're supposed to reflexively hate, with breathtaking, accessible, empathetic humanity.\\" Weber continued, \\"There's a sad haunted quality to her character...\\" Sarpy made her debut on the TV Source Magazine's fan poll of the Top Soap Actresses in September 2015. Jenn Bishop of TV Source Magazine argued that Valerie wasn't defined enough within the story for it work and she wasn't \\"feisty enough\\" to be a viable threat to Dante and Lulu. Kendall Joseph of Soap Happenings congratulated and applauded Sarpy for \\"doing a good job at having fans love and hate\\" her character, described the portrayal as \\"spot on\\" and said many agreed with the sentiment. \\"The role of Valerie Spencer is quickly becoming on the more popular, even if there is a lot of negativity clouded in there.\\" Joseph also praised Sarpy's chemistry with Robert Palmer Watkins and but said \\"a love connection isn't really believable.\\" Soap Opera Digest included the actress on its list of the \\"Hottest Newcomers\\" for the year 2015. In March 2016, Stacy Miller of Nerdy Girl Express launched the \\"We Love #GH ‘s Valerie Spencer Fan Project\\" in honor of Sarpy's one year anniversary where fans could share their appreciation for the actress and character. Miller observed that while the plot had its detractors, Valerie's relationship with Dante made her a fan favorite practically \\"overnight.\\" Miller said \\"General Hospital has something special in this actress and her character. Thank you for hiring her to play this character.\\" Soap Opera Spy also released a feature interview with Sarpy commemorating her one-year anniversary on the series.

An all-volunteer organization, JMR coordinates with Capital City Fire/Rescue, the Juneau Police Department, the Alaska State Troopers, the United States Coast Guard, and other emergency response agencies during search and rescue operations. Operational history Juneau Mountain Rescue was founded in 1982 after Steve Lewis taught a series of high-angle rescue classes in the Spring, Summer and Fall of 1982. Founding members: Steve Lewis, Bob Poe and Cathy Poe, and Jeff Badger. In 1989 Lewis, Cynda Stanek, & William (Bill) Wildes incorporated JMR. Lewis served as JMR's director 'til 2009 - having completed more than 212 search, rescue and recovery operations. Since 2004, JMR has been a fully accredited member of the international Mountain Rescue Association (MRA), having passed a rigorous test of JMR's rescue abilities at Juneau's Eaglecrest Ski Area. At the time of its accreditation, JMR was one of 56 mountain rescue agencies accredited by the MRA. Juneau Mountain Rescue operates under the FCC call sign WPZP295 for radio communications. The call sign is currently licensed until February 11, 2024. Notable incidents In December, 2000, a Bellanca Scout airplane carrying former Routt County, Colorado Sheriff Ed Burch, at the time working as a flight instructor, and another man went missing during a training flight near Juneau. Juneau Mountain Rescue, working with other agencies, including the local Civil Air Patrol and the Army National Guard, found pieces of the Scout between Douglas and Admiralty Island. The plane's fuselage and passengers were never found. In January, 2011, JMR volunteers, working with the Alaska State Troopers and the Coast Guard, rescued an injured hiker on Ripikski Mountain, near Haines. A Coast Guard crew on a MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter, dispatched from Sitka, transported the hiker to Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau. In March, 2014, two teenage boys, one a local resident and the other a visitor from Switzerland, got lost hiking on Mount Juneau. The teens were able to call for help on a cell phone, and told emergency dispatchers that they were \\"cold and disoriented\\". JMR volunteers, working with a commercial helicopter company, located the teenagers and returned them to town. In May, 2014, a woman named Sharon Buis was reported missing in the area of Juneau's Mount Roberts. A search was coordinated by JMR on both Mount Juneau and Mount Roberts, with parts of the effort being facilitated by use of the Mount Roberts Tramway. JMR coordinated with the Alaska State Troopers, and the US Coast Guard during the lengthy search. Despite an exhaustive search, Buis was never found. After several days of searching, the case was transferred to the Juneau Police Department, and is an active missing persons case. On February 15, 2015, four hikers were rescued by members of JMR, after becoming stranded in mountainous wilderness in the Thane area of Juneau. The hikers suffered injuries related to cold weather conditions, and were taken to Bartlett Regional Hospital.

The concept, also offered by its market competitors Alibaba and Baidu, is based on the Chinese tradition of hongbao (red envelope, or red packet), where money is given to family and friends as a gift. The application was launched by Tencent in January 2014 and has subsequently gained popularity, with Tencent reporting 2.3 billion transactions on 1 January 2016 alone. The application offers users the ability to give monetary gifts in the form of virtual 'credits' to other users of the application. Money is deposited into a user's WeChat Pay account, which can be used for purchases. The app allows withdrawals from that account. There are two types of 'red envelopes' offered by the app: the pairwise red packets, via which money is sent from a private chat of two users, and the group red packets, where money is distributed in a group chat. The 'grouped' red envelope can then be posted to a group chat and the application randomly assigns the amount in each envelope to each recipient. Since WeChat launched its virtual red envelope campaign in 2014, WeChat Pay has more than doubled its market share. Timeline * In June 2013, WeChat first enabled mobile payment on its platform. * On 17 January 2014, WeChat launched the red envelope application. * From August 2014 to January 2015, the company was in a period of research and development. * From 12 February to 21 February 2015, WeChat unleashed 500 million red envelopes full of cash and another three billion virtual coupons to its users. * On 18 February 2015, WeChat cooperated with CCTV Spring Festival Gala, the most-watched TV show of the year. Phenomenon \\"Shake your Booty\\" In 2014, WeChat partnered with the Spring Festival Gala and introduced the WeChat red envelope shake. During the gala, users were invited to shake their smartphones for a chance to win red envelopes. A total of 1.2 billion red envelopes, worth over half a billion RMB (US$83 million), were sent out during the promotion. The number of shakes during the gala promotion achieved a total frequency of 11 billion and a peak of 810 million per minute. To win red envelopes, some people shook multiple smartphones to increase their chance of winning, and some people put their smartphones and tablets in a sieve to shake them simultaneously. Red Envelope War The Red Envelope War is a financial battle between the two Internet companies competing for the mobile payment market in China. The competition attracted widespread attention from the public. On February 10, 2015, Alibaba announced it would give away RMB600 million (around US$97m) of “lucky money” to users, with RMB156 million in cash and RMB430 million of e-coupons from merchants on its marketplaces. Half a day after Alibaba's announcement, WeChat announced it would give away RMB500 million (around US$81m) cash and RMB3 billion (around US$484m) of e-coupons the next night. Through Alipay Wallet, users were able to share Alibaba's digital red envelopes with their WeChat friends and send them onto WeChat's sharing platform Moments. Shortly afterwards, WeChat disabled the capability. Alibaba then changed their application to require more direct interaction with Alipay Wallet if a user wanted to give the \\"lucky money\\" to their WeChat friends. Specifically, they changed the application to generate an image with a number which could be shared on WeChat, prompting one's WeChat friends to download and open Alipay Wallet and type in the number to redeem the money. Achievement Market Shares Open the Potential Market To send or receive money in the app, users need to link their bank accounts to WeChat. It is estimated that 100 to 200 million clients with their bank details have begun using WeChat. Impact on Business The growth of WeChat led some companies to use the WeChat's red envelope platform to market their brands, giving away cash or coupons to the public. This in turn drew more people to WeChat accounts and use the red envelope function, increasing the user base. Criticism Phubbing Problem Traditionally, Lunar New Year carries themes of reunification and strengthening relationships. However, the emphasis placed on cash-based incentives has changed the focus of the tradition into a monetary venture. Fraud In 2015, people were deceived by fake users and imposters on the WeChat red envelope platform. One large instance of fraud occurred when a user claimed to be Chen Guangbiao, a billionaire. This user promised to give out as much as RMB 20 million (US$3,157,000) in virtual red envelope via WeChat. Many WeChat users added the user, hoping to receive a red envelope from the billionaire. Instead, the user never gave out any money himself but ended up receiving a significant gain from users who added him. Later, Chen claimed that he was not in any way involved in the scam and urged those who were misled to contact the authorities. To avoid the similar events, Chinese police have sent out the warning messages to the public. Corruption Under China's corruption campaign, red envelope has been positioned as gears of bribery because it is hardly noticed by the public. Cases related have already reached 51,600 as of July 2014, recorded by Chinese government. Currently, WeChat has set a RMB200 (US$33) ceiling for red envelope-gifting. Yet precisely since the amounts involved are small and because many people might be involved in the gift-giving through the virtual red envelopes, it has proven to be challenging for the government to monitor corrupt practices carried out in this manner.

She was one of the first American artists to embrace Cubism and Futurism. Early life and education Alice Morgan Wright Papers. Alice Morgan Wright (seated third from left) with other students and models in art class Wright came from an old Albany family. She was born October 10, 1881 to Henry Romeyn Wright, a prosperous wholesale grocer, and Emma Jane Morgan. A student at St. Agnes School in Albany (now Doane Stuart School), Wright graduated from Smith College in 1904 and continued her studies, in sculpture, at the Art Students League of New York. The League awarded Wright both the Gutzon Borglum and the Augustus Saint-Gaudens prizes for her outstanding art work. Prohibited from attending life studies while attending the Art Students League, Wright watched local boxing and wrestling competitions in order to study the human form.Albany Institute, 55Charlotte Streifer Rubinstein, American Women Sculptors (1990), p. 221 In 1909, Wright went to Paris, where she attended the École des Beaux-Arts and the Académie Colarossi. In Paris she was a pupil of Injalbert and in New York she studied with Gutzon Borglum, James Earle Fraser and Hermon Atkins MacNeil.Opitz, Glenn B, Editor, Mantle Fielding's Dictionary of American Painters, Sculptors & Engravers, Apollo Book, Poughkeepsie NY, 1986 p. 1060 Career Artist Medea The Off-Shore Wind She exhibited domestically at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Art Institute of Philadelphia, and her work appeared in Europe at the Royal Academy of Arts (London) and the Salon des Beaux Arts (Paris). She was a member of the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors as well as a founding member and director of the Society of Independent Artists.Charlotte Streifer Rubinstein, American Women Sculptors (1990), p. 221. \\"The Fist,\\" perhaps her best known sculpture, shows the modernist influence of Auguste Rodin; other works, like \\"Medea\\" (1920), integrated avant-garde Cubist and even Futurist elements. It is likely influenced by the struggle for women's voting rights. Wright also produced more conventional pieces throughout her career. Wright worked slowly and often moved back and forth between a conservative and a more experimental style. Wright was a member of the National Sculpture Society.Petteys, Chris, “Dictionary of Women Artists: An international dictionary of women artists born before 1900”, G.K. Hall & Co., Boston, 1985 p. 769 She exhibited two pieces, Wind Figure, a stone carving and Young Faun, a bronze statuette, at the Societies 1923 exhibition.National Sculpture Society, Exhibition of American Sculpture Catalogue, 156th Street of Broadway New York, The National Sculpture Society 1923 p. 250, 348 Her very abstracted work Medea was shown at the 1929 exhibition.National Sculpture Society, Contemporary American Sculpture, The California Palace of the Legion of Honor, Lincoln Park, San Francisco, The National Sculpture Society 1929 p. 338 Betsy Fahlman curated a retrospective exhibit of Wright's work in 1978 at the Albany Institute of History & Art titled Sculpture and Suffrage: The Art and Life of Alice Morgan Wright (1881-1975). By 1945, Wright had abandoned art in favor of her animal rights activism. Suffragist Wright was also an ardent suffragist. She worked for the Collegiate Equal Suffrage League. While studying art in Europe, Wright involved herself in both the British and French suffrage movements; notably, Wright organized a meeting in Paris where English suffragist Emmeline Pankhurst spoke. Wright also arranged for Pankhurst to make an appearance in Albany during her tour of the United States in 1911. With the National Women's Social and Political Union, she participated in militant demonstrations in England. She was incarcerated for two months in Holloway Prison, London. With other suffragettes, she protested her treatment by participating in a hunger strike. Wright used uneaten food to create models of her fellow prisoners, using sugar cubes as bases, rather than let it go to waste. She also used smuggled plasteline to model a portrait bust of her fellow prisoner, Pankhurst. Wright continued her suffrage activism after her return to the United States in 1914. She was Recording Secretary of the Woman's Suffrage Party of New York during the winning campaign. Wright only returned to sculpture full-time after the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. In 1921, she helped to create the League of Women Voters of New York State. Political activist In 1920, Wright returned to Albany and gradually turned away from art to focus on political activism, especially animal rights.Charlotte Streifer Rubinstein, American Women Sculptors (1990), p. 222. Wright was a benefactress to the National Humane Education Society; in 1950, with Wright's help, the NHES established its first animal care facility, called the Peace Plantation Animal Sanctuary. Wright also wrote the organization's 12 Guiding Principles, which is still in use. In 1957, Wright lobbied President Eisenhower against using animals in medical testing and scientific research; in 1958, Congress passed the Humane Slaughter Act. Wright served as a delegate to the 1948 United Nations assembly in Paris. Around the same time, Wright also served as an organizer for United Nationals Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Personal life Wright and Edith J. Goode were lifetime companions. Goode was born in Springfield, Ohio, and raised in Washington, D.C. Edith attended Sidwell Friends, at that time a small Quaker School, then attended Smith College (like Wright, graduating in 1904) where the two women met, and together they worked tirelessly for peace and justice. Goode was a member of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and co-founder of the National Woman's Party. Goode also served as a president of The Humane Society of the United States.  Death and legacy  Wright died in Albany at the age of 93, on April 8, 1975. Wright and Goode created the Alice Morgan Wright-Edith Goode Fund, an endowed trust that supports animal welfare organizations.

In terms of Hindu philosophy, the living entity or Jiva is āśraya, and Brahman or the Supreme Being, the Godhead, is viśaya, the supreme objective, the goal of life Bhagavata Purana (VII.x.6). But, this word - āśraya conveying the primary meaning – 'refuge', immediately relates with the deity which is worshipped rather than with the abstract Brahman, the substratum of all that exists. Hindu view-point Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, which promotes qualified-monism, holds the belief that Jiva is anu or monadic in substance. Jiva though infinitesimal, is the individual atman harboured by a body, which atman the Mundaka Upanishad tells us, to be known by the mind is capable of becoming infinite through its attributive knowledge. Jiva is kartā and bhoktā, both; it is the āśraya for jñāna, the substrate for krti or prayatna (effort) caused by the desire to act. Therefore, Jiva is the āśraya for the states of experience that invariably involve changes in mental disposition without affecting the Jiva. Shankara does not consider avidyā (ignorance) as something positively existent, he does not speak about its vikśepa-śakti (power of dispersion) or avarna-sakti (power of concealment); he does not raise avidyā to an eternal metaphysical entity. Shankara also does not subscribe to the view that the individual soul is the bearer of avidyā (āśraya) or to the contention that the Paramatman is the āśraya of avidyā as is held by Mandana and Vācaspati. He reiterates that for an awakened person there is no avidyā to delude and cause pain or pleasure. In the context of the origin of the world (the original state is called avyakta) he terms Parameswara-Brahman as the āśraya of nāmarūpe (the physical presence which name manifests) and that Brahman is the āspada (locus) of the cosmic vyavahāra imagined by avidya. Knowledge implies the subject which knows and the object that is known. Suppression (avarna) precedes substitution (viksepa); avidyā makes one misapprehend and therefore it is described as positive (bhāva-rūpa), and does not contradict vidyā (knowledge). With regard to the transmigrating souls, Shankara does speak about the bhūta- āśraya or elementary substratum or material substratum of the soul, the subtle body, and about the karma- āśraya or moral substratum connected with vāsanās (impressions), karma (works ordained or forbidden) and pūrvaprajñā (previous experience) but he does not accept the existence of subtle persisting elements of works or preparatory elements of fruits called apurva because of their non-spiritual nature. According to the Bhagavata Purana (one of the 18 Mahapuranas or 18 Major Puranas) the personal aspect of God is the Āśraya of the ātmā. Jaina viewpoint Condition of existence (gati), according to Jain philosophy, is the state of a soul shaped by gati- nama-karma (body-condition-making) or is the cause of the soul passing through any one of the four conditions of existence – hellish, sub-human, human and celestial. They subscribe to the view that in a thing which is permanent the existence of sāmānaya and samavāya is complete, that means that common properties cannot exist without individuals possessing them; the individuals are the āśraya; sāmānaya and samavāya is complete in one substance will not exist without āśraya (substratum). Buddhist view-point Vasubandhu explains that the āśraya (foundation or support) of the fundamental change that indicates ātmabhāva (psychophysical continuum) is the non-conceptual wisdom free from the duality of the apprehender and the apprehended; āśraya refers to obscured tathagatagarbha (the fourth vajra-point) and its change (tataparāvrtti) which is enlightenment (the fifth vajra-point). It is possible to replace one āśraya with another by freeing the ayatanas (internal and external sense- bases) from physical and mental impregnations of negative tendencies which bring about craving, suffering etc., by cultivating calm abiding and superior insight, which process activates theayatanas associated with awareness (vidyā) that purify all impregnations of negative tendencies and involve raising oneself to śuddhāśrayabhūmi, the level of pure superior intention, never to return to the lower realms or suffer rebirth. Tathatā is the basis of transcendental wisdom, and Bhūtatathatā is the genuine 'Suchness', the essential nature of phenomenal existence, the self-identical universality, the grounding (āśraya) truth of finite particularity. The Buddhists believe that the skandhas, the ayatanas and the dhātus are the dharmas that constitute the phenomenal world and are the forms (and the conditioning factors) in which consciousness appears to itself. Bhūtatathatā is the āśraya i.e. the basis which is to be transformed (āśraya-paravritti), and also the āśraya which is the result of the transformation. Therefore, it is the āśraya of delusion and awakening. The Mahāyāna-samparigrahaśāshtra tells us that the mind of Reality is ever obstructed by āveṇkī avidyā which is manas, the seventh consciousness and the āśraya of mano-vijñāna and the five sensorial consciousnesses evolved from self-patterning of the Absolute; the attachment of manas to ātmagrāha (egohood) and dharmagrāha (thinghood) makes the perception of the multiplicity of forms possible. The Mahāyāna- abhidharmasutra tells us that the beginningless dhātu (locus) is the equal support (āśraya) of all phenomena (dharma) and rests in the body as seeds. According to the Yogacaras, ātmabhāva and āśraya basically mean – \\"body\\", and who also tell us that āśraya-paravritti can be of the mind or path or errant tendencies. Hindu astrology Āśarya yoga, a special kind of planetary placement with most planets resting in moveable or fixed or common signs (rāsis), is one of the thirty-two varieties of Nabhasa yogas in which regard Varahamihira tells us – : अनुष्टुभ्-आश्रयोक्तास्तु विफला भवन्त्यन्यैर्विमिश्रताः  : मिश्रा येस्ते फलं दद्युरमिश्राः स्वफलप्रदाः  : \\" The Āśarya yogas become ineffective, when they look like other yogas, and those other yogas become operative and bear results. When the Āśarya yogasdo not bear any resemblance with other yogas, it is then that the Āśarya yogas produce results. \\" – Brihat Jataka (XII.12) References Category:Vedanta Category:Buddhist philosophical concepts Category:Technical factors of Hindu astrology Category:Hindu philosophical concepts Category:Jain philosophical concepts Category:Sanskrit words and phrases ","title":"Asraya"},{"id":"46184829","text":"William Ross Tetley (July 11, 1933 – June 9, 2003) was a Canadian curler.

SSTL is a corporate spin-off from the University of Surrey, where Sweeting is a Distinguished Professor who founded and chairs the Surrey Space Centre. Education Sweeting was educated at Aldenham School and the University of Surrey, completing a Bachelor of Science degree in 1974 followed by a PhD in 1979 on shortwave antennas. Career and research With a team he created UoSAT-1, the first modern 'microsatellite,' which he convinced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to launch, as a secondary piggyback payload into Low Earth orbit alongside a larger primary payload. This satellite and its successors used amateur radio bands to communicate with a ground station on the University campus. During the 1980s Sweeting took research funding to develop this new small-satellite concept further to cover possible applications such as remote sensing, and grew a small satellites research group that launched a number of later satellites. This led to the formation of Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd in 1985, with four employees and a starting capital of just £100,Britain's spaceman, The Economist Technology Quarterly Q2 2015, 30 May 2015. and to a know-how technology transfer program, introducing space technologies to other countries. SSTL was later spun off from the University and sold to Astrium in 2009 for a larger sum. Awards and honours In 2000 Sweeting was awarded the Mullard Award by the Royal Society and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in the same year. In recognition of his pioneering work on cost- effective spacecraft engineering, Sweeting was knighted in 2002.

It combines genres of cyberpunk, urban fantasy and crime, with occasional elements of conspiracy, horror and detective fiction. From its inception in 1989, Shadowrun has remained among the most popular role-playing games. It has spawned a vast franchise that includes a series of novels, a collectible card game, two miniature-based tabletop wargames, and multiple video games. The title is taken from the game's main premise – that industrial espionage runs rampant in a near-future setting. A shadowrun – a successful data theft or physical break-in at a rival corporation or organization – is one of the main tools employed by both corporate rivals and underworld figures. Deckers (futuristic hackers) who can tap into an immersive, three-dimensional cyberspace are opposed by rival deckers and lethal, potentially brain- destroying artificial intelligences called \\"Intrusion Countermeasures\\" – \\"IC\\" for short – who are protected by street fighters and/or mercenaries, often with cyborg implants (called cyberware), magicians, and other exotic figures, on such missions as they seek access, physical or remote, to the power structures of rival groups. Magic has also returned to the world after a series of plagues; dragons who can take human form have returned as well, and are commonly found in high positions of corporate power. Setting Shadowrun takes place several decades in the future (2050 in the first edition, currently ). The end of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar ushered in the \\"Sixth World\\",See 2012 phenomenon. with once-mythological beings (e.g. dragons) appearing and forms of magic suddenly emerging. Large numbers of humans have \\"Goblinized\\" into orks and trolls, while many human children are born as elves, dwarves, and even more exotic creatures. In North America, indigenous peoples discovered that their traditional ceremonies allow them to command powerful spirits, and rituals associated with a new Ghost Dance movement let them take control of much of the western U.S. and Canada, where they formed a federation of Native American Nations. Seattle remains under U.S. control by treaty as a city-state enclave, and most game materials are set there and assume campaigns will use it as their setting. In parallel with these magical developments, the setting's 21st century features technological and social developments associated with cyberpunk science fiction. Megacorporations control the lives of their employees and command their own armies; the ten largest have extraterritoriality, such as currently enjoyed by foreign heads of state. Technological advances make cyberware (mechanical replacement body parts) and bioware (augmented vat-grown body parts implanted in place of natural organs) common. The Computer Crash of 2029 led to the creation of the Matrix, a worldwide computer network that users interact with via direct neural interface. When conflicts arise, corporations, governments, organized crime syndicates, and even wealthy individuals subcontract their dirty work to specialists, who then perform \\"shadowruns\\" or missions undertaken by deniable assets without identities or those that wish to remain unknown. The most skilled of these specialists, called shadowrunners, have earned a reputation for getting the job done. They have developed a knack for staying alive, and prospering, in the world of Shadowrun. Publication history Shadowrun was developed and published by FASA from 1989 until early 2001, when FASA closed its doors and the property was transferred to WizKids (a company founded by former FASA employees). Two years before its closure, FASA sold its videogame branch, FASA Interactive to Microsoft corporation, keeping rights to publishing novels and pen and paper RPGs. Since then, digital rights to Shadowrun IP belong to Microsoft since 1999. WizKids licensed the RPG rights to Fantasy Productions (who were already publishing for the German version) until they were acquired by Topps in 2003. Catalyst Game Labs (a publishing imprint of InMediaRes Productions) licensed the rights from Topps to publish new products. WizKids itself produced an unsuccessful collectible action figure game based on the property, called Shadowrun Duels. Shadowrun Fifth Edition was announced in December 2012. It was released as a PDF in July 2013, with a limited-edition softcover version of the Fifth Edition core rulebook sold at the Origins Game Fair in June 2013. The hardcover version was released in August 2013. It was generally similar to the system that was unveiled in Fourth Edition and modified in the Twentieth Anniversary Edition. A Sixth Edition, titled as Shadowrun, Sixth World, was announced on 1 May 2019 to coincide with the game's 30th anniversary, along with a new website at shadowrunsixthworld.com. The game was released to the public on 26 August 2019. The mechanics for this new version are generally similar to those of Fifth Edition, with some systems reworked for what Line Developer Jason Hardy describes as streamlining the system. This new version also progresses the in-game year to 2080. Since 2004, Shadowrun Missions (SRM) has offered fans \\"living campaigns\\" that allow for persistent character advancement. SRM is broken down into \\"seasons\\" which are made up of up to 24 individual missions that can be played at home, with special missions available to play exclusively at conventions. Each SRM season develops an overarching plot focused on a specific city from the Shadowrun setting. Missions settings have included the divided city of Denver, the corporate city-state of Manhattan, and the Seattle Metroplex city-state, and the formerly walled-off wastelands of Chicago. The Shadowrun role-playing game has spawned several properties, including Shadowrun: The Trading Card Game, eight video games, an action figure game (Shadowrun Duels), two magazines, an art book and more than 50 novels, starting with the Secrets of Power series which introduces some of the original characters of Shadowrun and provides an introduction to this fictional universe. In addition to the main rule book (now in its sixth edition) there have been over 100 supplemental books published with adventures and expansions to both the rules and the game settings. Catalyst Game Labs announced that 2013 would be \\"The Year of Shadowrun,\\" and in addition to the release of Shadowrun Fifth Edition that it has collaborated with publishers on the following properties: Shadowrun: Crossfire, The Adventure Deck-building Game; Shadowrun: Sprawl Gangers, a tactical miniatures wargame; and Shadowrun: Hostile Takeover, a board game designed by Bryan C.P. Steele is planned for release in late 2014/early 2015. Catalyst had been in collaboration with Nordic Games and Cliffhanger Studios to create Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown online RPG, however it was shuttered 30 November 2018 with the producers citing lack of funding and the end of the license terms for use of the IP. Fictional universe The Shadowrun world is cross-genre, incorporating elements of both cyberpunk and urban fantasy. Unlike in a purely cyberpunk game, in the Shadowrun world, magic exists and has \\"worked\\" since 2011. Among other things, this split humankind into subtypes, also known as metatypes/metahumans. Some of these metatypes take the form of common fantasy races. Likewise, some animals have turned into familiar monsters of past fantasy and lore and both monsters and human magicians have regained magical powers. By the second half of the 21st century, in the time the game is set, these events are accepted as commonplace. Man, machine, and magic exist in a world where the amazing is among the most common and technology has entered into every facet of human (and metahuman) life. Races Characters in Shadowrun can be humans, orks, trolls, elves, dwarves, as well as certain diverging subspecies (known as metavariants) such as gnomes, giants, minotaurs, etc. In the early days, when magic returned to the world, humans began to either change into, or give birth to elf and dwarf infants, a phenomenon called Unexplained Genetic Expression (UGE). Later, some juvenile and adult humans \\"goblinized\\" into other races (mostly orks, but also some trolls). The term \\"metahuman\\" is used either to refer to humanity as a whole, including all races, or to refer specifically to non-human races, depending on context. With the return of Halley's Comet new human variants called \\"changelings\\" arose. Two of the metahuman races have fictional languages. Additionally, a virus known as the Human Meta-Human Vampiric Virus (HMHVV), with many variant strains, has been known to cause further change, far beyond that of traditional vampirism, frequently resulting in fierce abominations that are no longer human and sometimes no longer even sentient: bandersnatches, banshees, dzoo-noo-quas, goblins, ghouls, nosferatus, vampires, wendigos, wild fomorians, and others. Most of these species do not consider human/metahuman types as more than victims, and are generally treated as dangerous subjects by society. They are not normally available as player characters. Dragons are also present in the awakened world, though not as player characters. Dragons are very powerful physically, magically, and in some situations, financially; some dragons found the riches they hoarded and hid during the last Awakening. Their great intelligence allowed them to gain a great deal of influence and power quickly and a few have risen to high political and economic posts, running entire corporations or even as heads of state. Game background The game is set 62 years in the future, following a great change that has returned magic to the world. The emergence of magic, the outbreak of the VITAS plagues, the Computer Crash of 2029, the Euro-Wars, and the fevers for independence of Amerindian tribes, Chinese provinces, and everything else that came with the many struggles that ravaged Europe and Asia left the world's governments tumbling and falling. The United States was broken into substates. Monetary value was lost. The world had to rebuild, and rebuild they did, this time in the image of the megacorporations that seized power. Taking advantage of the laws that had been passed years ago, and using their newfound freedom, the megacorps began impressing their power on the failing governments. Before long the world was transformed. Boundaries were redrawn, and the political landscape was changed forever. A basic premise of the setting is that as the world endured the string of state-changing events and conflicts, the political landscape fragmented and reformed. In North America, for example, some nations broke apart and reformed, as was the case with the Confederation of American States and the United Canadian and American States, while others became havens for specific racial or ethnic groups, like Native American Nations (the Native Americans having used their newfound magical abilities to regain massive tracts of land) or the Elvish principality of Tír Tairngire, which encompasses all of the state of Oregon. Some, like the California Free State, simply declared independence, while yet others became de facto corporate subsidiaries like Aztlan (the former Mexico), the headquarters of the Aztechnology megacorp. Despite the new role of megacorporations, many nations still hold considerable sway through economic, social and military means. For most people, “getting by” means taking advantage of whatever the corps or the government might bring their way. The corporations The monolithic \\"enemies\\" of the Shadowrun world (borrowing heavily from cyberpunk mythos) are the corporations, dubbed \\"megacorporations\\", \\"megacorps\\", or simply \\"megas\\" or \\"corps\\" for short. Megacorporations in the 21st-century are global, with all but the smallest corps owning multiple subsidiaries and divisions around the world. They are the superpowers of the Shadowrun universe, with the largest corporations having far more political, economic, and military power than even the most powerful nation-states. In Shadowrun, corporations are effectively \\"ranked\\" by the amount of assets under their control, including material, personnel, and property, as well as profit. These ranks are A, AA, and AAA; AAA corporations are top tier. Most corporations in the AA and AAA level are immune to domestic law, responsible only to themselves, and regulated only by the Corporate Court, an assembly of the ten AAA-rated corporations. All AAA- rated and most AA-rated corporations exhibit a privilege known as \\"extraterritoriality\\", meaning that any land owned by the corp is sovereign territory only to the corp and immune to any laws of the country it is located in. Corporate territory is not foreign soil but corporate soil, just like its employees are corporate citizens, though dual citizenship in a corporation and a nation is common. The AAA corps, as well as numerous minor corporations, fight each other not only in the boardroom or during high-level business negotiations but also with physical destruction, clandestine operations, hostile extraction or elimination of vital personnel, and other means of sabotage. Because no corporation wants to be held liable for damages, it has to be done by hired deniable assets, or \\"shadowrunners\\", invisible to the system where every citizen is tagged with a System Identification Number (SIN). Technology and the Matrix Despite the Crash which caused much data corruption, technology in the game is advanced. Ability-enhancing Cyberware (artificial cybernetic implants) and Bioware (genetically engineered biological implants) emerged and has become commonplace. Characters can also augment their bodies with nanotechnology implants. In earlier editions of the background fiction, direct neural interface technology enabled humans and metahumans to directly access computers and the Matrix, the global computer network restructured after the 2029 Crash. Access to the Matrix was accomplished by \\"deckers\\": individuals that have \\"cyberdecks\\", portable or worn computing devices that are interface with the user's brain through a brain–computer interface implant called a \\"datajack\\", that is typically located at the temple or behind the ear. In Shadowrun, Fourth Edition, the Matrix rules have changed, thanks to the setting's constant evolution and a drive to match real world technological developments. After the second Matrix crash in 2064, Matrix technology was moved away from the wired network and led into a wireless technology. The most noticeable difference between the Matrix in the 2070s and the earlier editions is that wireless technology has become completely ubiquitous. Communications and Matrix access is provided through Wi-Fi nodes placed throughout the infrastructure of just about every city on Earth, fulfilling a service similar to contemporary cell sites—but as these nodes are as numerous as telephone poles, only a tiny percentage of their range is necessary. The nodes of all electronic devices a person carries are connected in a similar manner, creating a Personal Area Network (PAN). People access their PAN with their Commlink, a combination personal computer/cell phone/PDA/wireless device available either as a brain implant or a head- mounted display. This access can be the total sensory immersion common to cyberpunk fiction, or a sensory enhancement by which the virtual features of one's physical surroundings can be perceived and manipulated. Other worn or carried personal devices are linked to the PAN, and this includes smart firearms. The Matrix of the 2070s is thus not only a virtual reality, but an augmented or mixed reality. Cyberdecks are obsolete, so \\"deckers\\" have once again become \\"hackers\\". In turn, the otaku of previous versions (deckers who did not need decks to access the Matrix) have been reworked into technomancers, who possess an innate connection to the Matrix that permits them to access the wireless network without hardware, though the phenomenon is not fully understood even within the setting, and may be partly magical in nature. In Shadowrun Fifth Edition, corporations have cracked down on hacking, reforming the matrix into Grids for better control and creating the Grid Overwatch Division (GOD). Hackers were thus forced to acquire specialized, larger variants of commlinks with better processing power, which were swiftly colloquially named \\"cyberdecks\\" after the devices of old. This has resulted in the return of the term \\"decker\\" of earlier editions. Meanwhile, \\"riggers\\" are people who use datajacks and in most cases a special type of cyberware - called the \\"control rig\\" - to interface with vehicles and drones. Often they also use a remote control deck called the \\"rigger command console\\". The term \\"rigger\\" may also be applied to others using these machines. Riggers jump in to machines to control them with their mind. While jumped in they feel like they are the machine, using the vehicle or drone's sensors to replace their own. This allows the rigger to control their machines at Matrix speeds and with greater precision. The downside is if the machine takes damage the rigger will have to deal with dangerous levels of biofeedback. Likewise, the rigger may have to engage in cybercombat with hostile parties that may attempt to hijack control of their devices. Magic Those able to actively interact with the magical energies of the Sixth World are known as \\"awakened\\". An awakened character's power in magic is linked to their Magic attribute. A magic user's approach to working with mystic energy is called their Path. The Awakened fall into three general Paths: magicians, adepts and mystic adepts. Broadly speaking, magicians focus their magic outward, actively affecting the world around them, while adepts focus their magic inward, passively enhancing their bodies and minds. Magicians are able to cast spells, summon spirits, and create magical artifacts called \\"foci\\". All magicians follow traditions that determine their understanding of magic, including hermetic mages (whose control of magic comes through study and manipulation of magical energy or mana, and who summon and bind elementals in lengthy and expensive rituals to be called on later) and shamans (whose magic derives from a connection to nature via a totem spirit, and who can summon the nature spirits associated with a particular place). Adepts use magic internally in order to accentuate their natural physical abilities. Adepts can run on walls, use mundane objects as deadly thrown projectiles, shatter hard objects with a single unarmed blow, and perform similar feats of incredible ability. All adepts follow a very personal path (Path of the Warrior, Path of the Artist, etc.) that normally determines their abilities which might be very different for any two adepts (while one might demonstrate increased reflexes and facility with firearms, a second might possess unparalleled mastery of the katana, and a third might be able to pull off incredible vehicular stunts). Mystic adepts, also known as physical mages, are part magician and part adept who distribute their magic power between the abilities of both aspects. System Mechanics A 6-sided die with the Shadowrun symbol in place of the 6. The Shadowrun game mechanics are based entirely on a 6-sided dice system. The game is skill-based rather than class-based, but archetypes are presented in the main book to give players and gamemasters an idea of what is possible with the system. Before the fourth edition, skill and ability checks worked as follows: all actions in the game, from the use of skills to making attacks in combat, are first given a target number that reflects the difficulty of the action which is then raised or lowered by various modifying factors, such as environmental conditions, the condition of the character, the use of mechanical aids, and so forth. The player then rolls a number of dice equal to their level in the relevant skill, and the number of dice rolled that meet or exceed the target number determines if the character is successful performing the action and the degree of success the character has. As an example, a character with a high firearms skill not only has a better chance at hitting a target than someone with a lower ranked skill, but also is more likely to cause more damage to the target. Target numbers may exceed 6, in which case any dice that show a 6 have to be re-rolled (a target number of, e.g., 9 is reached by rolling a 6 followed by at least a 3; thus, a target number of 6 and one of 7 are identical, except extra dice rolls are not allowed for target number 7 or greater). For even higher target numbers, this procedure has to be repeated; thus, an action with a target number of 20 (like attempting to procure military-grade weaponry) will only succeed if three successive dice rolls result in sixes, and the fourth gives at least a 2. For any dice-roll a roll of 1 always counts as a failure. This system allows great flexibility in setting the difficulty of an action. In addition to this basic mechanic, players can use several task-specific dice pools to add bonus dice to certain tests, though dice that are used do not refresh until the end of a turn. This adds an extra tactical element, as the player must decide where best to spend these bonus dice. For example, combat pool dice could be spent to improve attacks or to improve defense, or some of each. Players also have Karma Pool that can be used to reroll any dice that failed to reach the target number. Karma Pool refreshes rarely, typically once per scene or less, at the GM's discretion. The combination of Karma Pool and dice pools gives players a considerable amount of freedom to decide how important a task is to their character. Two characters with identical statistics could perform very differently on the same tasks depending on their priorities (and thus, allocation of dice pools and Karma Pool). In the fourth edition, things have changed substantially. The game still runs on six-sided dice, but now each task is given a threshold. The player then rolls dice equal to their skill plus the relevant attribute modified by applicable modifiers. The number of fives and sixes is equal to the number of hits. Hits above the threshold indicate extraordinary performance. Furthermore, if more than half the dice rolled are ones, then the player has made a glitch. Glitches cause bad things to happen to the player and game masters are encouraged to be inventive and funny. Archetypes Although the skill system is freeform, certain combinations of skills and equipment work well together. This combination of specialization in skill and equipment is known as an archetype. The most notable archetypes are street samurai, characters who have heavily augmented their bodies with cyberware and bioware and focus on physical combat; adepts, characters who have magical abilities that increase their physical (and sometimes mental) combat abilities; faces, highly charismatic characters who specialize in negotiations and social manipulation; hackers (deckers), experts in electronic surveillance, security, and augmented/virtual reality monitoring, combat and response; riggers, who augment their brains to achieve fine control over vehicles and drones; and magicians, who cast spells and can view emotions and call spirits from astral space. In Fourth Edition, with the setting change, deckers are replaced by hackers, who manipulate computer networks with augmented reality via ubiquitous commlinks; they also tend to take over the rigger's role. However, the archetypes are not character classes: the player is allowed to cross boundaries. Restrictions are not imposed by the system itself, but by the player's specializations. Because character-building resources are limited, the player has to weigh which game resource he wants to specialize in and which he has to neglect. This allows high character customization while still ensuring that characters are viable in the setting. Character creation The fourth edition of Shadowrun uses a point-based character creation system. Earlier editions and later in the fifth edition, used a priority-based system with point-based character creation as an advanced option. Priorities are divided into race, magic, attributes, skills, and resources. All things that do not explicitly fall under the first four classifications, including contacts in third and earlier editions of Shadowrun, are given cash-equivalent values to be bought with resources. Shadowrun characters are created with contacts, friends and acquaintances who serve as key nodes in the character's social network and who will often help the character out. Through the contacts system, players may uncover information that their characters cannot independently acquire. Additionally, players can often negotiate for the use of skills that their characters do not themselves have, a radical departure from most role-playing games. Essence and Karma/Edge Essence is a measure of a living being's lifeforce. All humans and metahumans start with a value of six (although critters may start with a higher or lower Essence). It powers magic, and as essence fades, so does magical aptitude. Cyberware, bioware, nanotech implants, extreme cases of substance addiction, and other major changes to a being's body can damage its essence as well. Generally, if a being's essence ever reaches zero, it dies. Cybermancy allows metahumans to survive with an essence rating of zero or less. Players are awarded Karma points as a game progresses. In third edition and earlier, these points are usually added to a total called Good Karma, which can be used to boost attributes and skills. Skills that are already well-developed cost more Good Karma than skills which are undeveloped, which helps encourage specialized characters to become more flexible by spending Good Karma on weaker attributes. Karma also makes characters more powerful in general because every tenth (or twentieth for metahumans) point is added to the Karma Pool instead of Good Karma. The Karma Pool allows players to re-roll dice or \\"purchase\\" additional dice in certain situations. Karma can even be used to avoid certain death, at the cost of all Good Karma and Karma Pool points. In fourth edition, Karma Pool is replaced by a new attribute called Edge which can be used in most of the same ways as the third edition Karma Pool. Experience and character advancement is still tracked with Karma, although Good was dropped from the name as it no longer needs to be distinguished from the old Karma Pool. Influences and links Shadowrun is linked to Earthdawn, and is set in the \\"Sixth World\\", where Earthdawn is the \\"Fourth World\\" and modern-day Earth is at the tail end of the Fifth World. Such links are not necessary for play, but they allow crossover potential. The concept of the \\"Worlds\\" is linked to the ancient Aztec belief that the world is renewed every five thousand years—a period called a \\"Sun\\" (currently we live in the fifth Sun). The date of the beginning of the \\"Sixth World\\" is based on the ancient Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, which when Shadowrun was developed was correlated as finishing a 5,200-year-long cycle on 24 December 2011. The understanding of the Maya that resulted in the use of the 2011 date and the use of the \\"worlds\\" concept is due to the influence of Frank Waters's 1975 book Mexico Mystique: The Coming Sixth World of Consciousness, whose elaborate cosmology is selectively utilized in the framework of the Shadowrun universe. Waters took his information about the date of the end of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar from the 1966 edition of Michael D. Coe's The Maya. Shadowrun is also influenced by the writings of William Gibson (particularly Neuromancer). Gibson, who gave no permission and expressed strong aversion for mixing his ideas with \\"spare me, *elves*,\\" reacted as follows to its release: In 2007, Robert Boyd from Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland, robbed a Belfast lingerie shop at knifepoint while wearing a blonde lady's wig. During his trial, Boyd stated he was playing Shadowrun, specifically the role of criminal elf Buho, at the time and may have \\"blurred reality and fantasy\\". This claim convinced only two members of the jury and Boyd was jailed for two years. Novels FASA released 40 Shadowrun novels in collaboration with Roc publishing between 1991 and 2001. Shadowrun novels went out of production between 2001 and 2005, making the books produced towards the end of FASA's ownership of the license hard to find. Another (41st) novel was announced, but never released. In 2005, WizKids began publishing new Shadowrun novels, again through the Roc imprint of the New American Library. Six novels were released in the new series. In 2008, Catalyst Game Labs announced the return of novels for Classic BattleTech, MechWarrior and Shadowrun. The announcement states that the first of the all-new Shadowrun novels would appear tentatively by early 2009, but the novels were not released due to unexplained delays in production of the novels for all three franchises. A collection of short stories titled Spells and Chrome was published in 2010. In 2012, Catalyst Game Labs published a standalone electronic novella, Neat, written by Russell Zimmerman. Catalyst later announced plans to release further fiction and eventually novels to be released in collaboration with Barnes & Noble in Winter 2013. Several additional novels were published in other languages. More than 30 novels have been written in German, by German and Austrian authors published by Heyne (since 1991) and FanPro (since 1997). Video games Eight video games have been developed based on the Shadowrun franchise; the first in 1993 was an action role-playing game titled Shadowrun and developed by Beam Software for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The second, also titled Shadowrun, was released for the Sega Genesis in 1994, developed by BlueSky Software. The third game was a visual novel adventure game developed by Japanese company Group SNE in 1995 for the Sega CD, again titled Shadowrun. A fourth game, titled Shadowrun: Assassin, was planned to be released in 1998 by FASA Interactive Technologies for the PC, but was cancelled. The next game released was a first-person shooter for the Xbox 360 and Windows Vista, entitled Shadowrun. It was developed by FASA Interactive, owned by Microsoft, which also produced the title. It was the very first game that allows cross-platform play on the Games for Windows – Live service. As the publishers of the Shadowrun role-playing game stated at the time of the video game's release: \\"Microsoft rewrote the timeline and setting for this game, so it is not in continuity with the tabletop RPG. It may be more accurately described as a game loosely based on Shadowrun.\\" In September 2007, Microsoft closed FASA Studios and licensed the Shadowrun electronic entertainment rights to Smith & Tinker, a company owned by Jordan Weisman, one of the original creators of Shadowrun. In 2012, Weisman's company Harebrained Schemes launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the development of Shadowrun Returns, a 3D turn-based single player role-playing video game. Approximately 1.8 million US dollars were pledged, four times more than the $400,000 goal. Shadowrun Returns was released on July 25, 2013. An expansion for Shadowrun Returns named Shadowrun: Dragonfall was created as a stretch goal, and then later re-released as a standalone game called Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut. In January 2015, Harebrained Schemes launched another Kickstarter to fund Shadowrun: Hong Kong, which was released August 2015. Jan Wagner's Cliffhanger Productions also ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for an online 3D turn-based strategy role-playing video game that can be played either alone or with other players. On 14 August 2012, the campaign was funded at $558,863. The game was due to be released at the end of 2013 as Shadowrun Online, but was actually released in April 2015 as Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown. Chronology of Shadowrun video games: * 1993 – Shadowrun (Beam Software; SNES) * 1994 – Shadowrun (BlueSky Software; Genesis/Mega Drive) * 1996 – Shadowrun (Group SNE; Sega/Mega CD) * 2007 – Shadowrun (FASA Interactive; Windows and Xbox 360) * 2013 – Shadowrun Returns (Harebrained Schemes; Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS and Android tablets) * 2014 – Shadowrun: Dragonfall (Harebrained Schemes; Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS and Android tablets) * 2015 – Shadowrun Chronicles: Boston Lockdown (Cliffhanger Productions; Windows, Linux, Mac, Ouya, iOS and Android tablets, all desktop browsers via the Unity Web Player) * 2015 – Shadowrun: Hong Kong (Harebrained Schemes; Windows, Linux, Mac) Reception In the August 1989 edition of Games International (Issue #8), Lee Brimmicombe-Wood was impressed by the production values, calling it \\"beautifully laid out and with some of the best illustrations I've seen outside of French rolegames.\\" He admired the skill resolution system, calling it \\"beautifully elegant,\\" although he found the magic system \\"instantly forgettable.\\" Despite all its good points, he found the game's reliance on standard Dungeons & Dragons tropes \\"does not sit all that comfortably in a cyberpunk universe. [...] The dumping of elves, dwarfs and orcs into this technopunk environment fails to work.\\" He concluded by giving Shadowrun an average rating of 3 out of 5. Lester W. Smith reviewed Shadowrun in Space Gamer Vol. II No. 2. Smith commented that \\"In Shadowrun is a very visual game system. That is, it encourages imagery and role-playing, without bogging down in overly dry rules.\\" In a 1996 reader poll by Arcane magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, Shadowrun was ranked 8th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: \\"Shadowrun's strength lies in the cleverly designed background, which creates a unique setting that actually works and is continually evolving. It also ties in with FASA's other main system, Earthdawn - while Shadowrun is the future, Earthdawn is the past of the same world. Between the two a fascinating universe has been created, offering a great deal of potential for all styles of play.\\" In 2007, Shadowrun was chosen for inclusion in Hobby Games: The 100 Best. Steven S. Long commented: \\"Shadowrun second edition belongs on the list of best hobby games because it so superbly integrates the gaming-specific material with the setting information. In doing so it satisfies what many gamers see as their twin needs: hard-and-fast rules that make gameplay fun; and an immersive setting that enhances the gaming experience, rather than detracting from it.\\" Awards Shadowrun 2nd Edition won the 1992 Origins Award for \\"Best Roleplaying Rules\\" and for \\"Best Graphic Presentation of a Roleplaying Game, Adventure, or Supplement\\". The Shadowrun role-playing game, various expansions, the short story anthology Spells & Chrome, and a Shadowrun collectible card game have won Origins Awards. The 4th edition also won the ENnie Awards for Best Rules as well as for Best Product in 2006. In 2010, Shadowrun – 20th Anniversary Edition won three silver ENnies: Best Interior Art, Best Production Values and Best Game.

At aged thirteen, he worked in a factory before returning to school and then in 1879 he was working for Gallagher Bros as an apprentice draper. By coincidence, a fellow employee was T.C. Beirne, who also went on to make a name for himself as a draper in Brisbane. Working career Accompanied by his only sister, McDonnell arrived in Brisbane in 1886 and began work as a drapery assistant with Finney, Isles & Co., T. J. Geoghegan, and, from 1889 till 1896, Edwards & Lamb. In 1901, in partnership with Hubert East and the financial backing of Peter Murphy, they established McDonnell & East, Drapers. Political life In 1888, McDonnell helped organise the Shop Assistants' Early Closing Association and its associated publication, the Early Closing Advocate with articles by William Lane. As a Labour candidate, he contested the seat of Fortitude Valley at the 1893 colonial election, losing to the Ministerialists, John Watson and John McMaster. McDonnell stood again for the seat of Fortitude Valley at the 1896 election, this time polling enough votes to finish second to John McMaster in the two-member electorate, and therefore winning a seat. He remained a member of the Legislative Assembly for the next eleven years, declining to stand at the 1907 election. Within three months of his retirement from the Assembly in 1907, McDonnell was appointed by the Kidston ministry to the Queensland Legislative Council. He remained a member until 1922 when the Council was abolished. Personal life McDonnell married Mary Heffernan in 1890 and together they had seven children.

The site featured explanations of the salary cap, the status of a players' contract, statistics, etc. Called revolutionary by hockey experts, CapGeek was launched in 2009 by Metro Halifax sports journalist Mathew Wuest. The site garnered commercial and critical success, becoming a top source for information on players' salaries and landed Wuest on The Hockey News' list of Top 100 Most Influential People in Hockey. CapGeek was disbanded on January 3, 2015, due to the owner's terminal illness and his unwillingness to turn the site over to another operator. Despite being un–accessible for the prior few months, CapGeek still received an estimated 10,360 hits in May, 2015.  History  CapGeek.com was founded in 2009 by Mathew Wuest, a Canadian sports reporter and internet entrepreneur. Wuest worked for Metro Halifax, covering a range of sports for their paper and website, but specialized in ice hockey. On the side, Wuest ran a site that updated the progress of Detroit Red Wings prospects, which was called RedWingsCentral.com. Originally called SalaryCapCalculator.com, Wuest was persuaded by his wife to change the name to CapGeek, as it was more marketable. Wuest slowly built his site until it suddenly \\"exploded\\" in popularity, to the point that NHL teams themselves were using it as a reliable source. The site ran until January, 2015, when Wuest shocked the hockey community in closing the site. Upon entering the website, a statement was displayed, which included \\"This sudden decision is made with a heavy heart and is due to the personal health of CapGeek.com founder and director Matthew Wuest\\". By its closure, CapGeek had become so well known within the hockey world that the NHL itself reported the closure of the site with a featured article on their main webpage. Despite Wuest stating that he had no intentions of selling, offers were made, as high as \\"six figures\\" in some cases. Wuest declined all purchase inquires. Wuest died in the early hours of March 19, 2015, at the age of 35, due to colon cancer. Many websites and reporters paid their respects, with TSN, The Hockey News, The Globe and Mail, The Toronto Star, The National Post, Sportsnet and Wuest's former employers Metro International being the notable publications. These authors and more wrote articles covering the life and career of Wuest, with some offering homepage coverage. On May 15, 2015, the Red Wings organization announced that they would be renaming the championship trophy of their NHL prospect tournament to the Matthew Wuest Memorial Cup. Similar sites Many ice hockey sites have since emerged with the intention of imitating CapGeek's business approach to the NHL. Examples include CapFriendly, HockeysCap.com, NHLnumbers.com, GeneralFanager.com, and HockeyBuzz.com. On May 13, 2015, HockeysCap.com was launched by Jamie, Ryan, and Chris Davis, as a tool for fans to view salary cap compliance information. The site was launched with a tool called \\"Armchair-GM\\" which allows fans to create custom rosters by trading, signing, and creating players, to determine the salary cap compliance of such team. The Davis brothers state they have the utmost respect for late CapGeek found Matthew Wuest, and that the HockeysCap.com was inspired by CapGeek. On February 3, 2016, it was announced that CapFriendly.com and HockeysCap.com would be merged into a single website. The merged site incorporated aspects of both websites, including the \\"Armchair-GM\\" tool. The new site has retained the CapFriendly name and URL. In early May, 2015, GeneralFanager.com was launched by Toronto Maple Leafs' fan Tom Poraszka, as a tool for fans to view salary and draft information. Poraszka was inspired by CapGeek and states that he \\"has a lot of respect for [Wuest]\\". Most of GeneralFanager's statistics were initially taken from CapGeek's archive; Poraszka has since developed insider connections to maintain up-to-date details for the latest contracts. On October 17, 2016, General Fanager was closed, as the founder, Tom Poraszka, was hired by the Vegas Golden Knights.

It was built from 1896 to 1941. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 May 2000.  History  The Kingston Pioneer Cemetery, on 2 small blocks of land in Kingston, was used as burial ground at least between 1896 and 1941. It is not known exactly when the land first came into use as a cemetery; however, the first known burial was in 1896 and the last in 1941. The graves of early pioneers, Charles and Harriett Kingston and John and Emily Mayes, are located in the cemetery. Captain Patrick Logan led the first expedition to explore the area south of Brisbane in 1827, and travelled through the area now known as Logan City. He described the area as having very fine timber and quite a few swamps. In 1849, ten years after the closure of the Moreton Bay convict settlement, the ban around the settlement was lifted, and the first leases of land around the Logan River took place. With the separation of Queensland from New South Wales in 1859, the new Queensland Government realised there was a problem, having too much land and not enough residents. Consequently, the government embarked on a program to encourage new immigrants to settle in Queensland from overseas, by giving them a land order when they arrived. Europeans began to settle around Loganholme in 1863, growing crops such as cotton and sugar cane. Already by this time, a cotton mill and sugar mill had been established. In 1868 James Trahey purchased a block of land where the Kingston railway station would eventually be located. At the time the area was known as Scrubby Creek. Trahey was the first settler to buy land in the area; however he moved away after only a very brief time. Charles Kingston headstone, 2006 Charles Kingston and his family (after whom the suburb was named) arrived in Australia in 1857. The family moved around the Brisbane area several times, including to Redbank, Oxley and Eight Mile Plains before settling on land near Scrubby Creek which Kingston had purchased in 1872. The Kingston's property was known as Oakwood. John Mayes and his family also moved to the Scrubby Creek area from England around the same time as the Kingstons. Other settlers, such as James Laughlin and the Armstrongs also selected land in the vicinity. Early industries that thrived in the area were timber getting, cotton growing and sugar growing. But it was soon realised that the area was very suitable for dairying and fruit growing due to the Logan River, and small swamps and creeks in the area. Both the Kingston and the Mayes families were involved in fruit growing, particularly grapes, and the area became known to produce excellent wines before the 1900s. There was also a coal mine and a metal and gravel quarry in the area. In 1877 the first post office for the immediate area was established, on the same site as Oakwood (the Kingston's home). Eight years later, in 1885 a rail service from Loganlea to Stanley Street in Brisbane was opened, the tracks passed through Charles Kingston's property. In 1888, Charles and his wife Harriett returned to visit England, and on their return made plans to build a new house, much grander than the first. The new home was built in 1890, on a hill which overlooked the railway station. Kingston House became a landmark for the district and is heritage-listed today. Their home (now at 5 Collin Court) could be seen from many points around Kingston, and the large ballroom in Kingston House was the centre of social life in the district. Charles Kingston died in 1904, three months after he and Harriett celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Harriett Kingston died in 1911. Both are buried at the Kingston Pioneer cemetery. Although the area in which the Kingston Pioneer Cemetery is situated is marked on an 1875 map as a reserve, it is not specifically labelled as a cemetery reserve and the date of the first burial is unknown. The earliest known grave is the cemetery is that of Frances Armstrong who was buried there in 1896. The graves of John and Emily Mayes are also found in the Kingston Pioneer Cemetery. John, Emily and their two small children arrived in Australia as free settlers on 9 July 1871 from England aboard the Indus. The family moved from Brisbane to Waterford, where they selected a property of soon after their arrival. The Mayes' lease was subject to conditions requiring improvements under the provisions of the Crown Lands Alienation Act (1868). The Kingston family were also subject to the same leasing requirements. When they arrived at what was to become Kingston, the Mayes family lived in a tent on the property, but in 1872 a small timber slab hut was constructed, now known as Mayes Cottage. The Mayes family were supported principally by timber getting on the property. Later, the Mayes family were involved in dairying and, in 1906, purchased shares in the newly formed Kingston Cooperative Dairy Company. John Mayes died on 10 June 1908 and was buried in the Kingston Pioneer Cemetery. Emily married John's brother Richard and moved to Mooloolah; however, following her death in 1933, she was buried in the Kingston Pioneer Cemetery.  Description  The Kingston Pioneer Cemetery is on two blocks of land either side of the driveway entering Kingston College, off Bega Road. The main, or larger, cemetery can be seen from Bega Road, the second, smaller cemetery, is located off Pioneer Road, in a south-easterly direction, approximately from the main cemetery. In the larger cemetery, which measures approximately , there are eleven graves, five of which are multiple burials. Of the eleven graves, seven are identified and four are unmarked. It is possible that there are more unmarked graves indicated by the spacing between some of the visible plots. The cemetery is on a grassed area surrounded by a timber slip rail fence with an entrance gate along the eastern boundary. Along the western boundary of the fence there is a half metre gap between the cemetery and a small area of bushland. A number of the graves are marked by large concrete headstones with decorative motifs. The grave of Charles Kingston is marked by an obelisk on a three tier plinth. The top of the obelisk has been broken off. Another grave, with two burials, is marked out by a low concrete enclosure with a concrete headstone with a marble plaque. Other graves are surrounded by metal fencing, some of which have decorative finials. The smaller cemetery, which measures approximately , is located off Pioneer Lane adjacent to Kingston College, and is thought to have been the Catholic section of the cemetery. In this cemetery there are 7 graves, one of which holds four burials. Two graves are unmarked; however, the size of the graves suggests the deceased may be children. The grave with the four burials is identified with a large concrete cross with decorative motifs and a plaque with the names of the deceased, another grave is marked out by a simple white, timber cross. All the graves, including the two small, unmarked graves, are surrounded by a metal fence with decorative elements such as finials. Logan City Council has placed interpretive signage at both cemeteries and both are currently maintained by the Council, which has also undertaken conservation work on some of the headstones.  Heritage listing  Kingston Pioneer Cemetery was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 May 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The graves of Charles and Harriett Kingston and John and Emily Mayes are found in the cemetery. The Kingston and Mayes families were two of the first pioneer settlers in the area, which was then known as Scrubby Creek. The cemetery is significant not only as the final resting place of some of the earliest non-Indigenous settlers in the area, but is also significant for its association with the descendants of those buried in the cemetery many of whom remain in the Kingston/Logan area. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It is significant for its association with the Kingston, Mayes and Armstrong families who contributed to the settlement and growth of the Logan area, particularly from the 1870s through to the mid-1940s. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The cemetery has a strong association with the people of Logan City, and the suburb of Kingston in particular.

COASST (Coastal Observation and Seabird Survey Team) is a citizen science project of the University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA, with a vision of monitoring marine ecosystem health with the support of citizens within coastal communities. With the help of hundreds of volunteers from different locations spanning the entire U.S. west coast from Washington to California and into the northern state of Alaska, COASST assesses beach conditions and identifies and tracks any carcasses of dead seabirds found. Data on the carcass of a seabird contributes to creation of a baseline record for the death rates of various species of seabirds including which beaches birds are found at and in what density. Any irregularities can be identified and evaluated so the cause of any increased mortality can be identified. COASST believes citizen scientists partnered with trained scientists create an invaluable relationship that benefits our ability to track and understand marine ecosystems. COASST works closely with state, tribal and federal agencies, environmental organizations and community groups to help this vision of monitoring, and successfully establish marine conservation solutions.  History  A common murre carcass found along the high wrack being prepared for photographic identification by COASST volunteers . Location: Ocean Shores, WA. COASST was founded in 1998 by Dr. Julia Parrish after her long-time work with coastal seabirds of the Pacific Northwest. Dr. Parish yearned for a change in the limitations of academic and agency science programs and wanted to be able to collect detailed annual data on seabirds. Dr. Parrish decided that there was a need for a seabird monitoring program that could generate baseline data for discovering patterns of seabird mortality, natural or human- induced, through the program. Due to the increasing human use of coastal waters, Dr. Parish envisioned a program that could provide data on both resident and migrant species of birds; mortality rates after oil spills; levels of chronic oiling, information regarding incidents of entanglement with fishing gear; and causes of death for seabird populations. After deciding that live bird monitoring programs were more difficult, Dr. Parish decided that an efficient, and more tractable program, could monitor carcasses from beached birds. The dead seabirds could be tracked and identified by anyone. In July 1998, Dr. Parrish obtained a grant from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation to fund her vision of creating a seabird monitoring program that would generate baseline data to help assess patterns of seabird mortality due to natural and human-induced events. The first director of the program Dr. Todd Hass co-developed COASST with Dr. Parrish. Ten years later, COASST has expanded from monitoring five beaches along the outer coast of Washington state, to almost 300 beaches spread across northern California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. COASST now has 500 participants, which makes COASST the largest beached bird monitoring network in the world today.  Current events  Currently, COASST is working hard to understand the cause of a crisis with Cassin's Auklet and the thousands of dead carcasses that have been found.

It conserves an important watershed area composed of secondary-growth forest, grassland and coconut land in the rural village of Buenavista within the coastal municipality of Mulanay. The area was primarily set aside for watershed protection and timber production in 1937 covering approximately . In 2000, it was reestablished as a protected landscape area under the National Integrated Protected Areas System. The area is known as the site of an ancient village containing unique limestone graves discovered in 2011. The protected area, including the limestone tombs of Kamhantik were recommended by various scholars to be included in the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, yet no government or private entities have yet to file a tentative nomination to the UNESCO Secretariat. Description The Buenavista Protected Landscape is an important watershed crossed by several rivers and streams such as the Mulanay River, Taisan Creek and Mahanao Creek which empty into the Sibuyan Sea. It is centered on Mount Maclayao (also known as Mount Kamhantik), the municipality's highest peak which rises to above sea level, in the sitio of Kamhantik in Barangay Buenavista. The protected area also contains several caves in the karst area extending to the village of Amuguis. The grasslands within the park are dominated by cogon grass and talahib. In the hilly areas grow forest tree species such as ipil-ipil, madre cacao and hauili. They provide the habitat for many migratory bird species such as the great egret, little egret, little heron, striated heron, plover, charadrius sp., whimbrel, common redshank, common greenshank, common tern and whiskered tern. Other wildlife known to inhabit the area include monitor lizards, wild cats, hornbills, owls, wild doves and bats. Archaeological site On the forest-covered summit of Mount Maclayao in Sitio Kamhantik, at least 15 limestone coffins dating to approximately the 10th to the 14th century have been unearthed by Filipino archaeologists in 2012. According to the National Museum of the Philippines, the limestone coffins are \\"similar to ancient sarcophagus with round holes where wooden posts of houses or sheds may have stood\\" but the covers are missing, probably due to irresponsible treasure hunters during the Yamashita hype in the late 20th century. These rectangular tombs carved into limestone outcrops from the forest ground are said to be at least 1,000 years old based on US carbon dating tests carried out on a human tooth found in one of the graves. An ancient canal drainage system is also profound in the area, where some canals go under centuries-old balete trees. Numerous limestone coffins are also located under centuries-old trees. In addition, archaeologists have also discovered shards of earthen jars, metal objects, and bone fragments of humans, monkeys, wild pigs, and other animals in the tombs. The site is unique in the Philippines in that it is the only ancient burial site with tombs made of stone material carved by metal tools. In 2015, the National Museum of the Philippines sent another team to do archaeological work in the site. The NM team found more human bone fragments, glass beads, gold artifacts, a small bell, and many others, however, the missing covers of the sarcophagi were not found. More than seventy percent of the site have yet to be studied and surveyed. Accessibility The Buenavista Protected Landscape is located about east of the poblacion or town proper of Mulanay and some southeast from the Quezon provincial capital of Lucena. It is accessible via the Pan- Philippine Highway (AH26) and the Miguel Suarez Highway (Bondoc Peninsula National Road) from Lucena and Manila to Mulanay, and through an access road to the base camp in Buenavista from the Mulanay town proper.

A rivalry game between the two schools, this game was held at Assembly Hall on Indiana's campus. In an upset victory that was considered a turning point for the Hoosiers program, unranked Indiana defeated top-ranked Kentucky 73–72 on a buzzer-beating three-pointer by Christian Watford, which was nicknamed the \\"Watshot\\". Background Indiana Indiana entered this game with an 8–0 record and had earned 4 points in the most recent AP Poll (released on December 5), enough for 39th place of all schools receiving votes. In the Coaches Poll released the same day, Indiana earned 23 points, sufficient for 31st place in the poll. Head coach Tom Crean was in his fourth season at Indiana, which hired Crean in April 2008 following the resignation of head coach Kelvin Sampson for recruiting violations. Crean's first season in 2008–09 was the worst in school history, ending with a 6–25 record. Indiana improved to 10–21 in the 2009–10 season, and then to 12–20 in 2010–11. Kentucky Like Indiana, Kentucky entered this game with an 8–0 record. Kentucky was also ranked #1 in the AP and Coaches Polls. Head coach John Calipari was in his third season at Kentucky, having led Kentucky to the 2010 Elite Eight and 2011 Final Four in the previous two NCAA Tournaments. Kentucky also had a star-studded group of freshmen on its roster, consisting of four former 5-star recruits in Anthony Davis, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Marquis Teague, and Kyle Wiltjer. Rivalry Indiana and Kentucky have a basketball rivalry dating back to 1924. The rivalry series had been played annually since the 1969–70 season on a home-and-home basis. Kentucky had won the past three games in this series. For the 2011 game, students lined up as early as 10 hours before tipoff for tickets. Game summary The game had a total of 13 lead changes, and neither team could extend its lead by much throughout the game. Kentucky's largest lead was 6 with 8:17 to go in the first half; Indiana's largest lead was 10, at 63–53 with 15:56 left in the second half. Neither team could get ahead. However, Kentucky rallied to take a 69-68 lead with 2 minutes to play, and the lead would change three more times. Indiana's Christian Watford made a layup to put Indiana up 70–69 with 1:07 left, and then Kentucky's Marquis Teague followed that up with his own layup to give Kentucky a 71–70 lead. After Watford missed a jumper with 30 seconds left, Indiana's Cody Zeller fouled Kentucky's Anthony Davis with 19 seconds remaining. With Kentucky only in the bonus (it was Indiana's ninth 2nd-half foul), Davis missed the front end of the one-and-one free throw, and Indiana's Victor Oladipo rebounded. After an Indiana timeout, Kentucky's Doron Lamb stole the ball from Oladipo and was fouled with 5.6 seconds left. This foul put Kentucky in the double bonus; Lamb missed his first free throw attempt, but made the second to put Kentucky up 72–70. Watford inbounded the ball to Verdell Jones III, who drove the ball by a screen set by Zeller at half-court. Jones then passed the ball to Watford, who made a Darius Miller-contested three-pointer at the buzzer to win the game for Indiana, 73–72. Players, students, and fans immediately stormed the court. Aftermath Impact on Indiana basketball With this win, Indiana beat a #1 ranked team for the first time since beating Duke in the Sweet 16 round of the 2002 NCAA Tournament. It was also Indiana's first win over a #1 team at Assembly Hall since beating Michigan State on January 7, 2001. Watford's game-winning, buzzer-beating shot in this game has been compared to Keith Smart's game- winner that sealed Indiana's 1987 NCAA title. Josh Sanburn wrote for Time.com: Sanburn also characterized Watford's game-winner and the court-storming that followed as \\"a collective and spontaneous surge of relief\\" following the seasons after the firing of Bob Knight. College Magazine also credited this game as a reason behind a \\"resurgence\\" of Indiana Hoosiers basketball. Rematch in 2012 NCAA Tournament Indiana and Kentucky met again in the Sweet 16 round of the 2012 NCAA Tournament on March 23 in Atlanta. Kentucky won 102–90 and would eventually win their eighth NCAA championship. Future of series This game remains the final regular season men's basketball matchup between Indiana and Kentucky, after Crean and Calipari could not reach an agreement on game venues. Indiana wanted to continue playing the series on a home-and-home basis rotating between the two schools' campuses, while Kentucky wanted to play on a neutral court at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. The future is unclear since Crean's firing. Broadcasting The game was televised nationally on ESPN and carried on radio by both schools' radio networks, the Indiana Hoosier Sports Network and UK Sports Network. Nielsen ratings ranked this game the 23rd most-watched program of the week ending December 13, 2011, with 3.59 million viewers and a share of 2.3. SportsBusiness Daily ranked this game the third most-watched regular season college basketball game on cable for the 2011–12 season.

AKC is caused by many different serotypes and is highly contagious during the acute phase. Epidemiology The economic and social price of AKC as a community epidemic is high. Clinical signs Corneal opacities, the hallmark of the chronic phase, are usually self-limited. They may occur as numular keratitis. Treatment Topical steroids should be avoided because they prolong viral replication, frequently lead to long-lasting dry eye symptoms, and corneal opacities almost always recur after discontinuation of topical steroids. There is currently no effective and clinically applicable topical antiviral agent for the treatment of the acute phase of AKC. Topical cidofovir is the first antiviral agent which has effectively reduced the incidence of corneal opacities, but local toxicity rules out its clinical application. Recently, NMSO3, a sulfated sialyl lipid, has demonstrated a greater antiviral potency against adenovirus in vitro than cidofovir exhibiting minimal cytotoxicity. Topical cyclosporin A (CsA) appears to be effective in the treatment of persistent corneal opacities. Topical interferon might be effective as a prophylaxis of infection.

It is also known as The Village of Logan Provisional School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 December 2007.  History  Sign in front of Old Logan Village State School, 2016 The Logan Village School was built in 1900; the teacher's residence (formally the Provisional School) is an earlier building dating from 1894. As a set, the two buildings represent the transition of educational facilities in early Queensland. The school is situated on River and Wharf Street, Logan Village. The buildings are situated a block from the Logan River and are surrounded by community sports grounds, children's play grounds and landscaped gardens using native flora. In 1826 Captain Patrick Logan, commandant of the Moreton Bay penal colony, explored the Logan and Albert Rivers. In the 1840s it was the timber-getters in search of cedar and hardwoods that moved into the district. These were the first Europeans in this area. By the 1860s, however, many Europeans from Germany, Ireland, and England had begun to establish settlement in the district. Under the Crown Land Alienation Act of 1860 settlers could purchase agricultural land for per acre, this was a direct attempt by the Queensland Government to encourage agricultural and pastoral industry as a means to increase the wealth and productivity of the young colony. It was also a way to encourage immigration to the colony. In conjunction with the Land Act the government reserved large tracts of land, known as Agricultural Reserves. These areas were surveyed into small blocks, ready for sale. One of these reserves was on the Logan River. By 1862, 68 blocks had been selected by 27 selectors in the Logan Agricultural Reserve. Those farming the Logan area found it beneficial to farm several differing crops so as to help ensure a viable and sustainable food source for the farm's inhabitants as well as a means of generating income. These smaller farms grew cotton, some sugar, maize, arrowroot, vegetables and many moved into dairying in the early twentieth century. The Village of Logan, as it was then known, was a closer settlement that began to prosper due to successful farming and its access to the Logan River. Logan Village was considered an important commercial settlement by its surrounding stations and settlements as far away as the southern border (New South Wales). Supplies were delivered to its wharf. By 1882 the village had a ferry, a hotel, a store and a church. It also had a reserved area for the future school. Early education in Queensland was privately conducted and at Separation of Queensland from New South Wales in 1859 there were only two National Schools, located at Warwick and Drayton, and churches ran most schools. The Education Act of 1860 created a Board of General Education for Queensland and new schools were built, local communities contributing to the cost. In 1869, provisional schools were introduced to economically solve the problem of educating children in thinly populated areas. Under this scheme, the parents of the pupils provided a simple building and the authorities paid for a teacher and books. From 1875 Logan Village used the local church for school. As enrolments were below 30 pupils, the Queensland Government recognised this school as a Provisional School. In the same year The Education Act was passed in the Queensland Parliament providing free (and compulsory) secular education, for all children. A major problem faced by the Logan Village Provisional School, and not an uncommon one in rural areas in Queensland at this time, was attendance. Many of the enrolled students would often spend many of their days working on the family farms. Limited Government assistance was given, such as salary assistance for a teacher and the supply of state approved books. The community had to provide the school building as well as accommodation for the teacher. By 1882 the conditions within the Provisional School classroom had become crowded and unproductive for the children. In a report from the School Inspector the small school was described in this period: \\"Honest work is being done in the school and work of a reliable kind, considering the unsuitable school-room and antiquated furniture\\". The community realised that a new school was needed; children's education was seen as extremely important to the residents of Logan Village. An important development for the Village was the railway link from Bethania to Logan Village, completed in 1885, this brought added prosperity to the Village due to an increase in traffic and trade to the area. It also provided a direct link to Brisbane other than the often unreliable waterway. With added prosperity the Village could afford to build a brand new school building. By 1882 the condition of Provisional Schools was an embarrassment to the Department of Public instruction and measures were introduced in an attempt to improve their standard. In some cases, such as Logan Village, the government agreed to provide half the construction costs and a recommended plan and specifications were prepared by the Department of Public Instruction. These schools could not be built within four miles of another school; this was the case with Logan Village. In 1882 a new school was requested by the Logan Village School Committee, composed solely of community members J. Powell, T. Bishop, J. Downman, H. Watson, I. Seymor, W. Drynan, and M. Hinchcliffe as Chairman. A petition was compiled to request permission from the Department of Public Instruction to build a new school building on Crown Land situated in Wharf Street. After constant campaigning from the School Committee to the Department of Public Instruction, in 1894 permission was finally granted and the community built the wooden school building for , half of which was paid for by the community, the other half by the Government. The wooden building was built under the Plans and Specifications detailed by the Department of Public Instruction. By 1899 enrolments in the Provisional School reached 43 students. In 1899 plans were drawn to build another new school building and to convert the existing one into the Teacher Residence. Enrolments had increased and more room was needed for the children. The request was submitted to the Department of Public Instruction. To have the school approved as a State School meant that the government would essentially run it, with minimal cost to the community. The Logan Village School was gazetted as a State School in September 1900, and had an attendance of 43 pupils. The Logan Village Hotel had previously been used for the accommodation of the teacher. Departmental policy was to provide married male head teachers in country areas with residences, thereby securing a resident caretaker and cleaner for the school in the person of the headmaster's wife. The requirements laid out by the Queensland Government in relation to the Teacher Residence specified a residence have no less than two rooms and a kitchen. What had been the Provisional School was converted to the Teacher Residence in 1900. The new school building was built from the standard plans set forth by the Department of Public Instruction. These plans had been designed by R. Ferguson, Superintendent of School Buildings. The building was to be a low set, timber framed, single skinned building. Design features included were to provide the required minimum area of eight square feet per pupil, a wide veranda at the front, a level floor throughout, lining of the walls, improved ventilation, larger and higher set windows. At the time of the transition from Provisional to State School in Logan Village changes to the school syllabus were put in place by the Department of Public Instruction. Increased writing, drawing and activity which required more space, greater detachment and privacy for the student were being taught in Queensland schools. Educationalists recommended that \\"an allowance of 18 inches per scholar at each desk and bench should be some multiple of 18 inches\\". These specifications were met within the new State School building in Logan Village. In 1901, the Queensland State Primary School system consisted of six classes, each extending over one and a half years. The school year was divided into three terms called \\"half-years\\", with two holidays, five weeks in summer and one week in winter. The school day was eight hours. Lesson contact time was 4 hours and 50 minutes. The core subjects were reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, geography, history, elementary mechanics, vocal music, drill and gymnastics and, for girls, sewing and needlework. The rest of the time was spent in neatness inspections and marching. In 1904 the Teacher Residence was further extended to accommodate the large family of the then teacher, Mr. Cooke. The price of the extensions was . In 1909 the underpart of the school building was asphalted. The river reserve was added to the school grounds in 1916, adding waterfront land to the school boundary. To commemorate past students killed and wounded in the First World War an Honour Board was erected in 1918 and was placed on the south wall inside the school building. The Logan Village State School was closed in 1981. The school building was raised and built under to accommodate a two level use of the building for community purposes. The Teacher Residence was converted into a local library. The two buildings retain their use as educational facilities. The river front land is now privately owned residential blocks.  Description  The Old Logan Village State Primary School and its Teacher Residence consists of two buildings, the earliest (the Teacher Residence) was built in 1894, the other in 1900. The buildings are situated a block from the Logan River and are surrounded by community sports grounds, children's play grounds and landscaped gardens using native flora.  The Teacher Residence  This building was initially built as the Provisional School in 1894. It is a low set timber framed structure. In 1904 the building, then the Teacher Residence was extended. The front stairs and veranda have recently been replaced with new timber, but replicates the original stairs and veranda. Externally, the building has weatherboard cladding, a corrugated iron double gabled roof, and is supported by steel posts. A veranda exists at the front (north) of the building, with a corrugated iron roof, central timber stair, timber posts and timber rail balustrade. There is two wooden framed windows either side of the front door that have had security bars fixed on them. The entrance door has been replaced with a modern wooden door. The extensions can be easily identified from the outside of the building as the original, single gable roof-line, weatherboards and windows remain in the older section of the building. The 1904 extension enclosed the rear veranda of the building; this is apparent due to the inconsistent roof line as the renovations have added an extra gable at the rear. Two wooden framed windows with timber and iron window hoods and covered ventilation windows above are built in the original part along each side of the building. Another window with a hood and no ventilation window sits beside the first on the east side. On the west side of the original building is a wide, closed doorway with no stairs to the ground. The extended part of the building has a door on the east side with a small wooden staircase to the ground. Two more windows were built into the extended building on the side and at the back, and a small set of louvers have been placed into the east wall where the present bathroom/toilet are. Internally, the original building consisted of two large rooms, and two smaller rooms to the rear, one for a kitchen the other a bathroom, with front and back verandas, but this changed with the 1904 extensions. These changes included adding two extra rooms at the rear of the building, enclosing the rear veranda and fitting a larger kitchen area at the rear. The renovations added an extra five metres to the length of the building. The interior of the existing building has high coved ceilings in the front two rooms. The walls and ceilings are sheeted internally by vertical wooden boarding. The boarding on the walls sits vertically; the boarding on the ceilings follows the curve of the coved ceilings. The divide between the front and middle room has been extended to provide two large rectangular arches, lined with pine wood, placed there for the ease of movement around the library. The present library utilises all the rooms, with large bookshelves and a librarian's desk. The rear room, the \\"kitchen\\", has a wooden partition built from the rear wall to the next wall in the direction of the front of the building, the ceiling boards slope at the corners to create an arched appearance. The west side of this partition once held the stove, and this is apparent due to the large panel of fibrolite placed over the stove culvert. On either side of this culvert are two small windows. Fibrolite panels have been used on the east wall of the rear room in contrast to the other three wooden board walls.  The State School  The State School building was built in 1900. It is a high set, wooden building. Originally it was low set with timber stumps until raised and built under in the 1980s. The exterior of the building has weatherboard cladding, a corrugated iron single gabled roof. At the front (north) of the building is a veranda with a central timber stair. The stair and the floor of the veranda are not original but from the renovations in the 1980s. The rail balustrade and veranda posts are timber. There is a swinging wooden gate at the entrance of the top of the stairs. The front door is not original, but of a modern type for security purposes. Above the front door sits an original swing window, to allow extra air and light into the classroom. Two large sash windows are on either side of the front door. The front wall of the veranda consists of exposed, unlined, original timbers. The ends of the veranda have wooden spandrels. The rear (south) of the building has a central wooden staircase. On either side of this staircase are two large wooden sash windows. The interior of the school building consists of one large room and an enclosed annex at the back, originally intended for hand basins and hats and coats. The main area of the school is a large hall with high coved ceilings. The walls are sheeted internally by wooden boarding that sits horizontally; the boarding on the ceilings follows the curve of the coved ceilings. The interior is illuminated by two sets of large, timber framed casement windows with extra top lights. The set on the west of the room are built high to sit above the blackboard. The set on the east of the room are the same size but sit lower on the parallel wall. The students were originally seated facing the west wall, where the blackboard is still situated. The set of windows on the south of the building have exterior timber and iron window hoods. The Roll of Honour for the Logan Village School has been erected on the internal south wall. The annex sits behind this wall to the back of the building. The door to the annex is an original wooden door; a swing window identical to that on the front door sits atop. On either side of this door are two sets of wooden sash windows. The renovation to the building in the 1980s built in underneath. A set of wooden stairs was placed internally from the annex to the ground floor. The interior of the downstairs area is tiled and the walls are plaster board. A small kitchenette has been installed on the south wall. Externally the added walls have been built with wooden boards, similar in appearance to those of the original upper part. The west side of the downstairs area has three wooden windows, the south has two, and the east side has two windows and a large wooden garage door to the rear. The grounds of the State School and Teacher Residence hold a small toilet block situated between the two buildings. The gardens are neatly landscaped with many native trees, shrubs and grasses.  Heritage listing  The Old Logan Village State School and its Teacher Residence were listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 December 2007 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Logan Village State School and Teacher Residence, that opened in 1900, reflects the development of, and changes in, Primary Education in Queensland. As a public building the school is a record of the development of the Logan Village area and the growth of, and changes to, the Logan Village Community. As a set of buildings it is an example of the successful transition that occurred in many areas of early Queensland as the Government's education policies succeeded, from Provisional School to State School. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. As well proportioned and detailed timber buildings built in a traditional style, the former Logan State School and Teacher Residence makes a substantial contribution to the built character of Logan Village. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The former Logan Village State School and Teacher Residence has a long association with the community of Logan Village and the surrounding areas as an important component of a public educational facility for many years.

Block A was designed by Richard George Suter and built in 1871. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 16 October 2008.  History  Waterford State School Block A is a single-storeyed timber building located at the corner of Nerang and Jordan streets, Waterford. The earliest section was erected in 1871 from local ironbark and pine and was designed for the Board of Education by Brisbane architect, Richard George Suter. It was the first national school opened on the Logan Agricultural Reserve, which was among the earliest and largest of the agricultural reserves established in Queensland in the 1860s when the government was seeking to encourage agricultural immigrants to settle in the new colony. Extensions to the building made in 1884 and in 1888-1889, when a second school room designed by the Department of Public Instruction's architect John Ferguson was added, created the present form of the building. The play shed was erected in 1898. The Waterford district was opened to closer settlement from the early 1860s, following proclamation on 2 January 1861 of the Logan Agricultural Reserve - 20,000 acres to the north and west of the Logan River, about south of Brisbane. The first allotments were offered for selection in April 1862. The reserve was more than doubled in 1863, with an extension of 25,000 acres south and east of the river proclaimed on 7 August 1863. The Reserve then encompassed the districts of Loganlea, Waterford, Logan Reserve, Logan Village, Buccan, Chambers Flat, Stockleigh and parts of Maclean (now North Maclean and South Maclean) and Park Ridge. On 18 October 1864, a further 8,000 acres extension to the Logan Agricultural Reserve was proclaimed - north of the Logan River, around Loganholme. Many of the settlers who first took up land on the Logan Agricultural Reserve in the 1860s were Irish immigrants who had come to Queensland under the auspices of the Queensland Immigration Society, established in 1861 by the Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, James Quinn. Between 1862 and 1865 approximately 6,000 Irish were encouraged to emigrate to Queensland under this scheme. At Waterford they formed a distinctive community. In the 1870s many of these Irish settlers moved from the Logan Reserve to take up selections at Tamborine Village, Kerry and Rathdowney, as the pastoral runs along the Upper Logan and Albert rivers were opened for selection. As the Irish moved off the Reserve, German immigrants who had taken up land around Bethania (German Pocket) from 1864, moved to the Waterford and Logan Village districts. In the 1860s and early 1870s colonial government encouragement of German immigration to Queensland resulted in a large influx of German settlers into the Logan district from the mid-1860s. The first schools in the Upper Logan and Albert rivers district were associated with the opening of the Logan Agricultural Reserve in the 1860s. A few private schools appeared briefly, but were soon absorbed into the public education system. The Education Act of 1860 created a Board of General Education in Queensland administered by the General Inspector of Schools. Until 1875 the Board was responsible for administering and assisting existing national (state), denominational and private schools and for constructing new national schools. Prior to 1869, the only government-assisted school on the Logan Agricultural Reserve appears to have been the Logan River Non-Vested School, established by the Irish Catholic community at Logan Reserve, north of the river on portion 44, in 1865. The lack of national schools on the Reserve reflected the failure of the early selection Acts and of the Education Act of 1860, which imposed school fees and required still-struggling farming communities to raise one-third of the cost of providing school premises and to guarantee a minimum average attendance of 30 pupils. In 1869, to facilitate primary education in the new agricultural districts, the colonial government introduced a system of provisional schools for smaller communities that could guarantee a student population of 15 (later reduced to 12). Provisional schools were generally temporary structures on non-government land. The government supplied the teacher and school books but did not fund building construction. Many provisional schools were conducted in slab huts and barns - often an existing structure offered by a local farmer. As the community became more established and a larger school population could be guaranteed, provisional schools were upgraded to national schools (later state schools). The Waterford State School was established as the Logan Provisional School, which opened on 29 June 1869 in a barn belonging to Charles Wilson on the east of the Logan River, south-east of the current Waterford State School. Of an initial enrolment of 22, over 75 per cent were from German families. In late 1869 the Waterford community petitioned the Board of Education for the establishment of a permanent national school, taking advantage of the colonial government's decision to abolish school fees, which came into effect in January 1870. After some debate as to the most accessible location, a site was selected in the centre of the town of Waterford, which had been surveyed in 1866 on the eastern side of the Logan River. This remains the site of the Waterford State School. Students who lived to the north and west of the Logan River attended school via the ferry, until the first Waterford Bridge opened in 1876. Tenders for a national school at Waterford were called in late 1870, the contract being let to Robert Hardy and John Ford of Beenleigh with a price of £140. The community would have contributed one-third of the cost of construction. The building was constructed of locally milled timber and opened in mid-1871 as the Waterford Primary School. It was the first national school constructed on the Logan Reserve. (Beenleigh National School, which opened on 7 February 1871, lay outside the Reserve.) Even so, the Waterford school was closed during parts of 1872 and 1873 due to lack of pupils and apparently to disagreements between the teacher and the local school committee. After a teacher's residence was erected in late 1873, the situation stabilized. At this period the colonial government engaged private architects to design new school buildings within planning and design parameters set by the Board of General Education. Waterford Primary School was designed by Brisbane architect Richard George Suter, who from 1868 to 1875 was responsible for most Queensland school designs, building mostly masonry schools in urban areas and developing a design for economical, simple-to-construct timber schools in rural areas. This design formed the basis of school planning for the next 50 years. The early Suter timber schools were low-set, gabled structures, rectangular in plan with a porch and no verandahs, and utilised external studding to the walls. After 1873 Suter introduced an \\"improved plan\\" adding front and rear verandahs to provide hat rooms and additional play and classroom space. The minimum size of a school was accommodating 48 pupils. Some plans show the floor slightly stepped to form a gallery. Suter's \\"improved plan\\" was used throughout the colony. Front of building, 2016 In 1876 David Ewart, General Inspector for the Department of Public Instruction, described the Waterford school building as measuring , with an entrance porch and no verandahs. It had exterior ironbark studs, pine tongue and groove walls, pine floor boards, and a hardwood shingled roof. The porch had narrow hardwood floorboards and a pine roof. Play sheds were introduced to Queensland schools in the 1870s to provide covered play areas adjacent to low set schools, and about 1874 an open-sided play shed of hardward posts and wall plates and a roof of boughs, was constructed to the south-east of the Waterford Primary School. This structure is no longer extant. The Education Act of 1875 instigated compulsory, free, secular primary education throughout the State. Under this Act the system of provisional schools was retained, but the government no longer funded non-vested schools (denominational and private schools), and the government-owned national and primary schools became known as state schools. The Act also abolished the Board of General Education, which had been responsible for the design of schools in Queensland, and created the Department of Public Instruction. The Colonial Architect, FDG Stanley, was given responsibility for school design and established new standard plans for timber schools. In 1879 responsibility for school design passed from the Colonial Architect's office to the Department of Public Instruction, which engaged the architect Robert Ferguson until 1885, when he was replaced by his brother John. Robert Ferguson developed new designs, which remained in use until 1893, after which responsibility passed back to the Department of Public Works. Ferguson also favoured single-skin construction, but with studs exposed inside rather than outside. In their designs the Ferguson brothers incorporated roof fleches or vents at high level in the gable walls. By the 1880s the Waterford district was more established, and the Waterford State School population was expanding. In 1884 a wide verandah was added to the back of the school building, providing additional classroom space. By 1888 enrolment had risen to around 100, and in late 1888-early 1889 the building was extended to John Ferguson's design, with the addition of another classroom measuring at the south-east end of the building, and construction of front and rear verandahs along the full length of the extended building. At this time the front porch was removed, to accommodate the wide verandah. The whole of the building was roofed with corrugated iron. Drawings show that the second classroom was of single-skin construction with studding exposed externally on the verandahs and internally on the new gable end. Walls were high. There was a high level vent in the gable and the ceiling was raked with a vent. There was a three bay window of tall, central pivoting windows with a central sill and a hood on the gable end and 3 pairs of narrow, central pivoting windows in the side walls. The double doors from the front verandah were off centre. The whole of the work, plus additions to the teacher's residence, was undertaken by John Fortune of Coomera, at a cost of £320. In 1898 a new play shed was constructed to the north-west of the school building, at a cost of about £49. It had a gravel floor, which in early 1900 was replaced with hardwood flooring (which in turn was replaced with asphalt in 1954). In 1901 the south-west end and along each side were enclosed with timber boards in sections, so that they could be removed during hot weather. In 1911 this boarding was replaced with corrugated iron sheeting. In 1910 the north-west gabled end of the school building was clad with weatherboards, covering the exposed stud framing, to prevent water damage where the original pine lining had shrunk. In 1939 the raised gallery with fixed seats in each classroom was removed and level flooring provided. From the 1960s the Waterford State School experienced a substantial increase in enrolments, reflecting the expansion of semi-urban settlement in the district. The rear verandah was enclosed to provide extra classroom space , and in 1968 a new school building (block B), with three classrooms and a storeroom, was erected behind and to the north-east of the original school, fronting Jordan Street. When this was occupied in 1969, the early school building was used as a library (accommodated on the enclosed rear verandah) and a tuckshop. In the 1970s school facilities expanded to the north-east on the school reserve and the original building was repaired in 1976 with the replacement of guttering, flooring, verandah railing and steps. It still functions as a classroom for individual music tuition and a space for learning support. The teacher's residence is no longer extant.  Description  View from Jordan Street, 2016 The original Waterford State School building stands on Nerang Street, which was the major street in the township of Waterford at the time of construction of the school. The new school complex to the north and east is accessed from Jordan Street at the side. The early school, now block A, is a low-set, gable-roofed, timber structure of two rooms with an open verandah at the front and an enclosed verandah at the rear. The north-western room is the 1871 section and the south-eastern room is the 1888-1889 extension. The studding is exposed on the verandahs of both sections and with the stud layout and cross-bracing typically associated with Suter designs on the north-western part. The 1871 room is wide with exposed Queen post trusses and a diagonal boarded ceiling and horizontal beaded boards on the walls. The windows are narrow horizontal pivot windows placed with two low (although sill heights are high) and one high on the gable walls. The windows in the verandah walls are casements with fanlights over and lower sills and are possibly a modification. The 1888-1889 section is long and has a coved timber ceiling with lattice ceiling vents and exposed timber tie beams. The gable vent, visible from outside, has been closed off. The gable wall was possibly originally unlined; the dividing wall is the original gable wall of the 1871 school and retains its high level windows. The windows in the 1888-1889 section are tall vertical pivot in banks of three and have higher sills than those in the verandah walls of the 1871 building. The pairs of doors probably date to 1888-1889 and have stop-chamfered frames with flush- beaded panels to those in the 1888-1889 section. The play shed is a typical hipped-roof, 10-post type with an enclosure at the south-west end facing the road. The roof framing is painted. A palm tree on the Nerang Street boundary may be early. The residence has gone but frangipani trees mark the location of the north-west boundary. The new school buildings, dating from 1968, are located to the north- east of the original school. They are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance for the purposes of this entry in the Queensland heritage register.  Heritage listing  Waterford State School (Block A and Play Shed) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 16 October 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Waterford State School (Block A and Play Shed), established in 1871 as Waterford Primary School with extensions made in 1884 (rear verandah), 1888-1889 (second school room, front verandah and extension of rear verandah) and 1898 (play shed), is important in illustrating the provision of state primary education in early Queensland agricultural settlements, following the passing of the Education Act of 1860, the abolition of school fees in 1870, and the introduction of compulsory secular education under the 1875 Education Act. In particular, the place is significant for its association with the agricultural settlement of the Logan River district. It was the first national school established on the Logan Reserve (one of the earliest and most extensive agricultural reserves in Queensland), and remains in situ and in use as part of the present-day Waterford State School. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Waterford State School (Block A) is a rare and early national school built of timber to the standard design of RG Suter and extended in 1884 and 1888-1889 during the period when the architects Robert and John Ferguson were preparing designs for the Department of Public Instruction. Both parts of the building are unusually intact. Suter schools are significant for the development of exposed framing in Queensland which became a building form of State importance. They were an early standardised form of school design which was to be a model for managing the construction of schools in Queensland's developing rural communities. Suter's designs for timber schools were widely distributed but few survive. Only two other substantially intact Suter timber schools have been identified: Morayfield (1873) and Mutdapilly (1874). Schools from the Ferguson period also have become rare. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Waterford State School, comprising Block A (1871 with 1884 and 1888-1889 additions) and Play Shed (1898 with later modifications), is set within a grassed school front yard. The place remains substantially intact and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a small late nineteenth century rural school. The play shed at Waterford is an important adjunct to the early school building and is typical of the designs produced in the 1890s. The two classrooms in Block A are very intact, retaining most of their early linings, joinery and hardware. As a consequence they are important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of early school design under RG Suter (1868-1873), and changes to school design under Robert and John Ferguson (1879-1893) to incorporate requests by educationalists for more windows, greater ventilation, and wide verandahs. The differing approaches to school design demonstrated in the early Waterford school building include: the different window layouts in the two rooms; the exposed roof timbers in the 1871 room compared with the ceiling lining in the 1888-1889 room with battened ceiling vent leading to a gable vent (now blocked up); the exposed framing inside the gable end of the second classroom (now enclosed with fibrous sheeting); and the differences in window pivoting arrangements. The external framing also is laid out differently in the two building parts. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place has aesthetic significance for its scale and the visual qualities derived from the materials, the exposed framing and high ceilings, its grassed setting, and its prominent location at the front of the school grounds on one of the main roads through Waterford.

When charged molecules, such as biomolecules, bind to the FET gate, which is usually a dielectric material, they can change the charge distribution of the underlying semiconductor material resulting in a change in conductance of the FET channel. A Bio-FET consists of two main compartments: one is the biological recognition element and the other is the field-effect transistor. The BioFET structure is largely based on the ion-sensitive field- effect transistor (ISFET), a type of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) where the metal gate is replaced by an ion-sensitive membrane, electrolyte solution and reference electrode. In a typical BioFET, an electrically and chemically insulating layer (e.g. Silica) separates the analyte solution from the semiconducting device. A polymer layer, most commonly APTES, is used to chemically link the surface to a receptor which is specific to the analyte (e.g. biotin or an antibody). Upon binding of the analyte, changes in the electrostatic potential at the surface of the electrolyte-insulator layer occur, which in turn results in an electrostatic gating effect of the semiconductor device, and a measurable change in current between the source and drain electrodes. Mechanism of operation Bio-FETs couple a transistor device with a bio-sensitive layer that can specifically detect bio-molecules such as nucleic acids and proteins. A Bio-FET system consists of a semiconducting field-effect transistor that acts as a transducer separated by an insulator layer (e.g. SiO2) from the biological recognition element (e.g. receptors or probe molecules) which are selective to the target molecule called analyte.Alena Bulyha, Clemens Heitzinger and Norbert J Mauser: Bio-Sensors: Modelling and Simulation of Biologically Sensitive Field-Effect- Transistors, ERCIM News, 04,2011. Once the analyte binds to the recognition element, the charge distribution at the surface changes with a corresponding change in the electrostatic surface potential of the semiconductor. This change in the surface potential of the semiconductor acts like a gate voltage would in a traditional MOSFET, i.e. changing the amount of current that can flow between the source and drain electrodes. This change in current (or conductance) can be measured, thus the binding of the analyte can be detected. The precise relationship between the current and analyte concentration depends upon the region of transistor operation.  Fabrication of Bio-FET  The fabrication of Bio-FET system consists of several steps as follows: # Finding a substrate suitable for serving as a FET site, and forming a FET on the substrate, # Exposing an active site of the FET from the substrate, # Providing a sensing film layer on active site of FET, # Providing a receptor on the sensing film layer in order to be used for ion detection, # Removing a semiconductor layer, and thinning a dielectric layer, # Etching the remaining portion of the dielectric layer to expose an active site of the FET, # Removing the photoresist, and depositing a sensing film layer followed by formation of a photoresist pattern on the sensing film, # Etching the unprotected portion of the sensing film layer, and removing the photoresistYuji Miyahara, Toshiya Sakata, Akira Matsumoto: Microbio genetic analysis based on Field Effect Transistors, Principles of Bacterial Detection: Biosensors, Recognition Receptors and Microsystems.  Advantages  The principle of operation of Bio-FET devices based on detecting changes in electrostatic potential due to binding of analyte. This the same mechanism of operation as glass electrode sensors which also detect changes in surface potential but were developed as early as the 1920s. Due to the small magnitude of the changes in surface potential upon binding of biomolecules or changing pH, glass electrodes require a high impedance amplifier which increases the size and cost of the device. In contrast, the advantage of Bio-FET devices is that they operate as an intrinsic amplifier, converting small changes in surface potential to large changes in current (through the transistor component) without the need for additional circuitry. This means BioFETs have the capability to be much smaller and more affordable than glass electrode- based biosensors. If the transistor is operated in the subthreshold region, then an exponential increase in current is expected for a unit change in surface potential. Bio-FETs can be used for detection in fields such as medical diagnostics, biological research, environmental protection and food analysis. Conventional measurements like optical, spectrometric, electrochemical, and SPR measurements can also be used to analyze biological molecules. Nevertheless, these conventional methods are relatively time- consuming and expensive, involving multi-stage processes and also not compatible to real-time monitoring,K.Y.Park, M.S.Kim, K.M.Park, and S.Y.Choi: Fabrication of BioFET sensor for simultaneous detection of protein and DNA, Electrochem.org. in contrast to Bio-FETs. Bio-FETs are low weight, low cost of mass production, small size and compatible with commercial planar processes for large-scale circuitry. They can be easily integrated into digital microfluidic devices for Lab-on-a-chip. For example, a microfluidic device can control sample droplet transport whilst enabling detection of bio-molecules, signal processing, and the data transmission, using an all-in-one chip.Choi K, Kim JY, Ahn JH, Choi JM, Im M, Choi YK: Integration of field-effect transistor-based biosensors with a digital microfluidic device for a lab-on-a- chip application, Lab Chip., 2012 Apr Bio-FET also does not require any labeling step, and simply utilise a specific molecular (e.g. antibody, ssDNA) on the sensor surface to provide selectivity. Some Bio-FETs display fascinating electronic and optical properties. An example FET would is a glucose-sensitive based on the modification of the gate surface of ISFET with SiO2 nanoparticles and the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOD); this device showed obviously enhanced sensitivity and extended lifetime compared with that without SiO2 nanoparticles.Jing-Juan Xu, Xi-Liang Luo and Hong-Yuan Chen: ANALYTICAL ASPECTS OF FET-BASED BIOSENSORS, Frontiers in Bioscience, 10, 420-- 430, January 1, 2005 Bio-FETs are classified based on the bio recognition element used for detection: En-FET which is an enzyme-modified FET, Immuno-FET which is an immunologically modified FET, DNA-FET which is a DNA-modified FET, CPFET which is cell-potential FET, beetle/chip FET and artificial BioFET- based.  Optimization  The choice of reference electrode (liquid gate) or back-gate voltage determines the carrier concentration within the field effect transistor, and therefore its region of operation, therefore the response of the device can be optimised by tuning the gate voltage. If the transistor is operated in the subthreshold region then an exponential increase in current is expected for a unit change in surface potential. The response is often reported as the change in current on analyte binding divided by the initial current (\\\\Delta I/I_{0}), and this value is always maximal in the subthreshold region of operation due to this exponential amplification. For most devices, optimum signal-to-noise, defined as change in current divided by the baseline noise, (\\\\Delta I/\\\\delta i_\\\\text{noise}) is also obtained when operating in the subthreshold region, however as the noise sources vary between devices, this is device dependent. One optimization of Bio-FET may be to put a hydrophobic passivation surface on the source and the drain to reduce non-specific biomolecular binding to regions which are not the sensing-surface.Kim JY, Choi K, Moon DI, Ahn JH, Park TJ, Lee SY, Choi YK: Surface engineering for enhancement of sensitivity in an underlap-FET biosensor by control of wettability, Biosens Bioelectron., 2013A.

Suppl. 2, 2002 (pages 21-23) Many other optimisation strategies have been reviewed in the literature. History The MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOS transistor) was invented by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng in 1959, and demonstrated in 1960. Two years later, Leland C. Clark and Champ Lyons invented the first biosensor in 1962. Biosensor MOSFETs (BioFETs) were later developed, and they have since been widely used to measure physical, chemical, biological and environmental parameters. The first BioFET was the ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET), invented by Piet Bergveld for electrochemical and biological applications in 1970. Other early BioFETs include the adsorption FET (ADFET) patented by P.F. Cox in 1974, and a hydrogen-sensitive MOSFET demonstrated by I. Lundstrom, M.S. Shivaraman, C.S. Svenson and L. Lundkvist in 1975. The ISFET is a special type of MOSFET with a gate at a certain distance, and where the metal gate is replaced by an ion-sensitive membrane, electrolyte solution and reference electrode. The ISFET is widely used in biomedical applications, such as the detection of DNA hybridization, biomarker detection from blood, antibody detection, glucose measurement, pH sensing, and genetic technology. By the mid-1980s, other BioFETs had been developed, including the gas sensor FET (GASFET), pressure sensor FET (PRESSFET), chemical field-effect transistor (ChemFET), reference ISFET (REFET), enzyme- modified FET (ENFET) and immunologically modified FET (IMFET). By the early 2000s, BioFETs such as the DNA field-effect transistor (DNAFET), gene-modified FET (GenFET) and cell-potential BioFET (CPFET) had been developed.

It was designed by John Hingeston Buckeridge and built from 1901 to 1915. It is also known as Memorial Church of St John the Evangelist. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 November 1999.  History  Foundation stone, 2006 St. John's Church at Mundoolun is a private family chapel built in 1901 on a property settled by the Collins family in the 1840s. The property is located between Canungra and Beaudesert in the Albert River Valley, South East Queensland. The church is constructed of local sandstone to the design of the Brisbane Diocesan Architect John Buckeridge who was commissioned by the Collins family in 1899. The chapel was built as a memorial to John and Anne Collins by their children, soon after the death of John Collins in 1898. The Collins had arrived in Australia from Ireland in 1839, the same year that the closure of the Moreton Bay penal colony made way for settlement of the area within a fifty-mile radius of Brisbane. Anne's cousin, William Humphries, had taken up 17,000 acres at Mundoolun in 1842, a venture the Collins followed with great interest. In 1844, they joined him as partners and by 1847, the Collins had bought Humphries out. The family went on to be prominent pastoralists, eventually owning Tamrookum, Rathdowney and Nindooinbah, as well as the home station of Mundoolun. The couple had five children. From 1863, when John Collins' sons joined him in the family business, they began to acquire properties further north and west. In 1877, Robert and William Collins formed the North Australian Pastoral Company in the Northern Territory with other shareholders and their interests and influence were wide-ranging. In 1878/79, Robert and William undertook a world tour which was to have a profound impact on Robert, in particular. In the United States, he was deeply impressed by the National Park movement and upon his return, began a serious campaign for the establishment of a national park in the McPherson Range. He continued this campaign until his death, becoming the Independent Member for Albert in the Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1896 and branch president of the Royal Geographical Society of Queensland in order to further his goal. Unfortunately he did not live to see the proclamation of Lamington National Park which eventually took place in 1915; however, he has been credited with the title of Father of the National Park Ideal. At about the turn of the century, Mundoolun and the Collins family were at the peak of their success. It was decided by the five children that a memorial to their pioneering parents should be built. They selected a site on a ridge of the Birnam Range, near the small cemetery overlooking the homestead and the Albert Valley. The family commissioned architect John Buckeridge to design the chapel. Buckeridge had come to Queensland in 1886 to supervise the construction of St.John's Cathedral in Brisbane. He had spent five years in the London office of leading ecclesiastical architect John Loughborough Pearson and came to Queensland on the recommendation of Pearson and the Archbishop of Canterbury to assist William Webber, the Bishop of Brisbane, in his ambitious building program for the diocese. Buckeridge was official Diocesan Architect from 1887 and erected about sixty wooden churches throughout Southern Queensland. He moved to Sydney in 1892 but continued as Diocesan Architect until 1902, delegating supervision of his plans to George Henry Male Addison and then Hall and Dods. Sketch of the church during construction, 1900 Hence, it was architect Robin Dods who supervised the construction of St. John's, Mundoolun. Work began on 22 June 1900. The construction took nearly eighteen months to complete, with fifteen men employed almost continuously for this time. The local stone proved very hard to work and progress was slow. The sandstone was quarried from an area further along the spur on which the church was sited and was brought to the masons' shed by dray. The altar, lectern, prayer desk, seats, doors and ceiling timbers were made of red cedar felled at Tamborine Mountain. The Archdeacon of Brisbane, Arthur Evan David, formally dedicated the church on St. John the Evangelist Day, 27 December 1901. However, the church wasn't consecrated until 29 August 1905, in a ceremony conducted by the Bishop of Brisbane. A tower was added in 1915 as a memorial to Robert Martin Collins who died in 1913. The footings for the tower had been laid in 1900 with the rest of the chapel, but took almost twenty years to be completed. Bells have never been installed. Services at that time were held in the church every second Sunday. More recently, the church has been used for weddings and other public events. In 2015, St John's Church at Mundoolun is part of the Jimboomba Parish within the Anglican Archdiocese of Brisbane.  Description  Side view of church, 2006 Cemetery beside the church, 2006 The inscription says \\"John Allen, native name BULLUMM of the Wangerriburra tribe, born at Tabragalla about 1851, died Mundoolan Jan 1931, he was the last survivor of his tribe, all his life he served the Collins faithfully\\" St. John's Church, Mundoolun is a family chapel constructed of sandstone designed in Early English Gothic style to the design of John Buckeridge. It is sited on the rise of a hill with an avenue of hoop pine leading to the entry porch. A small cemetery, also planted with hoop pines, is located to the southwest of the church. The church is simple in form but has a substantial quality that belies its size. It is orientated with the sanctuary to the southeast and comprises a combined nave and chancel, sanctuary, a southern vestry and northern porch attached, an organ chamber with a gallery and a western bell tower with a baptistry at its base. There is also a corrugated iron rainwater tank on the south side of the church. The walls of the church are of random ashlar sandstone, their thickness indicating a rubble core. The stone is rough dressed with a birds eye texture on the exterior and smooth faced on the interior. Also on the exterior, window surrounds and buttress cappings are smooth tooled. The steeply pitched roof is clad with wide pan corrugated galvanised iron. The porch, vestry and organ chamber have separate gable roofs below the main roof eaves. The north porch ceiling is lined with v-jointed cedar boards and the ornate framed and boarded two-leaf porch door is also made of cedar. The outer porch door has been removed as a result of vandalism and has been replaced by a metal security screen door. The walls of the tower are supported by buttresses. It has a castellated parapet and three belfry windows inset with timber louvres on each side. Lancet windows on each side of the church provide the only lighting for the church. Many of the windows have been replaced or repaired due to vandalism. The interior is characterised by high quality joinery constructed of red cedar gained from the local district. The barrel vaulted ceiling of v-jointed cedar boards is supported by arched ribs, the vestry, porch and baptistry have flat ceilings also lined in cedar. The baptistry has a coffered ceiling with hinged sections, presumably to provide for bell ropes. The organ chamber has a stone vaulted ceiling. Pews, altar rails and other furniture are also of cedar. The floors of the chancel, sanctuary, baptistry and vestry are raised above the floor of the nave and along with the nave passage, are laid with carpet. Around the walls are memorial plaques to various local identities including members of the Collins family. The small cemetery to the southwest of the church contains the graves of many members of the Collins family and their descendants, the Strachan, Delpratt and Balls families. Also buried here is Bullum, also known as John Allen, the last survivor of the Wangerriburra tribe who had a lifelong association with the family.

He was at the same duty in the Cabinet of Jovan Avakumović from July 12 until August 2, 1903, when he resigned. After he left the duty of minister of defense, on August 8, he was appointed Chancellor of Royal Decorations and he remained on that duty until March 31, 1906, when he was retired for the second time, this time upon his own request. During the war in 1912, as reserve general, he was mobilized and made a delegate of the Serbian Government with King Nikola Petrović and the Montenegrin Supreme Command. He remained a delegate until his return to Serbia in December 1913, when he was appointed Chancellor of Royal Decorations for the second time. After he was released from this duty, on April 1, 1917, he went to Switzerland, where he established Bureau for Prisoners of War. He was head of this organization until the end of 1918, when he turned over all the archival files to the International Federation of Red Cross, and he finally retired. Beside the mentioned wartime and peacetime appointments, he performed other duties as well. During the 1880s and 1890s in several occasions he was a member of the Examination Commission for officers.

The 2nd phase connects to a footbridge over the tracks of a currently unused platform of Penn Station. (foreground) Mulberry Commons is a public park in Newark, New Jersey. It was first proposed in 2005 to be the centerpiece of of the city's Downtown surrounded by Gateway Center, Newark Penn Station, Government Center and Prudential Center, a 19,000 seat arena which opened in 2007. The city had acquired the deed to the park land in conjunction with the construction of the arena, but the project had not been further developed. In March 2016, Mayor Ras J. Baraka announced a request for proposal for the park design. An official ground breaking ceremony took place October 2, 2017, and official opening of the first phase of the park took place May 30, 2019. It includes a city square of . Phase 2 of the park calls for a footbridge of over McCarter Highway and the Northeast Corridor with direct access to the train platforms at Penn Station. It will connect to the Ironbound neighborhood and a link to Newark Riverfront Park. The area around the Mulberry Commons, much of it owned by Edison Properties, will be developed by the company and other partners, initially converting the Newark Warehouse Building into retail and commercial space called Ironside Newark. Site and land acquisition New Jersey Central tracks crossed over former Pennsylvania Railroad & now Amtrak NJ Transit Northeast Corridor tracks Chinatown The park is near what was once the heart of Newark's Chinatown in the early 20th century. Only several hundred Chinese remain in the immediate area out of what were once thousands.https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/a-commons-for-all-vanguard-newarks- big-idea-challenge1 Central Railroad of New Jersey The site was earlier the rail yard of the western terminus of the Central Railroad of New Jersey's Newark and New York Railroad until service was discontinued and is used as a parking lot operated by Edison Park Fast operations, which owns numerous lots in the city. Triangle Park The park was originally called Triangle Park. The site is a parcel of approximately in the shape of a triangle. It is situated within the larger block bounded by Edison Place, Lafayette Street, McCarter Highway and Mulberry Street. The city acquired the land for the arena and park under the auspices of the Newark Downtown Core Redevelopment Corporation (NDCRC) for about $9.4 million in a series of complex purchase and transfer transactions with landowners Jose Lopez (a prominent local restaurateur)and Edison Properties, among others. The NDCRC was disbanded in April 2011 amid accusations of mismanagement. The land was transferred to the Newark Housing Authority in February 2015. Park proposals Former CNJ bridge over the NEC at Penn Station would connect park to platforms and the Ironbound and eventually Newark Riverfront Park The park was first proposed to act as a city square for new residential and commercial buildings in the district around the Prudential Center. Edison Properties, which owns development sites on the periphery of the proposed park, had previous agreements with the city and proposed more a passive park with open space. It promoted the adaption of the former CNJ bridge to pedestrian walkway footbridge over McCarter Highway, the Northeast Corridor rail tracks south of Penn Station, and NJ Railroad Avenue to the city's Ironbound neighborhood, with a projected timeline of 2007 and an estimated cost between $40-$60 million. In February 2015, the Municipal Council of Newark heard proposals for development of the park, which would change the original vision of the park and potential stakeholders. The city had opted to work with Boraie Development (developers of 50 Rector Park), which had a proposal that included retail and entertainment facilities. According to Mayor Ras J. Baraka, the development of a 125,000-square-foot passive park would cost the city about $200,000 to $300,000 a year to maintain. Baraka stated that it was \\"a very valuable piece of land\\" and should proceed with ratables. In March 2016, the city announced a new plan to build a 2.5-acre public park and a footbridge of with a direct connection to the train platforms at Newark Penn Station ending at a park in the Ironbound named for Peter Francisco. Edison Properties as well as other stakeholders including the Prudential Center, the New Jersey Devils, and J&L; Parking Corporation, have contributed funds and will oversee the development of the remaining acreage for commercial and residential uses. Commercial development The Newark Warehouse Building, a 1907 Newark landmark also known as the Central Graphic Arts Building, is located between the northeastern side of the park site and Edison Place. The first commercial project is the transformation of the building into Ironside Newark, following a design by Perkins Eastman. M&M; Mars-Wrigley signed a lease in 2017 for several floors in the building for office space. Some employees will be relocated here from their Chicago headquarters. Edison Properties will also locate its headquarters there.http://www.roi.nj.com://www.roi.nj.com/2018/11/09/real_estate/edison- properties-makes-it-official-its-moving-its-hq-to-ironside-newark/ Two prominent law firms have committed as well.http://www.roi- nj.com/2019/01/24/real_estate/second-law-firm-commits-to-ironside-newark/ The City of Newark Parking Authority is constructing a five-story parking deck with 515 spaces with ground floor retail space, a cafe with outdoor seating and offices to house the agency at the intersection of Mulberry St. & Green St. 777 McCarter Highway is a proposed 33 story, tall upscale residential building designed by Beyer Blinder Belle approved by the city in 2018.

The parish close was first established in 1555 then reconstructed in the 17th Century and reworked in the 18th Century. The church, the Église Sainte-Pitère, is dedicated to Saint Pitère (or Saint Pithère or Saint Piterre) and is shaped in the form of a Latin cross. The south porch was added in 1610, with a statue of Saint Pitère over the entrance. The nave has six transepts and aisles with two lateral chapels forming a faux transept. The enclos paroissial is distinguished first and foremost by the architectural quality of the church with its 1649 Renaissance double-galleried bell tower. The calvary is a listed historical monument since 1926. Calvaire Statues On a pedestal by the second column in the nave on the Evangelist side there is a 1527 Kersanton stone version of Ecce Homo, whilst in a corner of the choir on the Epistle side there is a wooden statue depicting Saint Pithère, one of many statues of the saint in the church. The friezes completing the decoration of the church's side porch date to 1610. Other statues include those of Saint Mélar, Saint Roch, Saint Sébastien and Saint Yves. There are also wooden statuettes of Saint Joseph, Saint Etienne, Saint Eloi and Saint Herbot. The south porch Statues of Saints Peter, Andrew and John This dates to 1610. There are twelve niches in the porch with only five now having statues in them. Four depict the apostles. In the first niche on the left of the eastern side of the porch is a statue of Saint Peter. It is inscribed with the donor's name \\"ALAIN:BREST\\". In the 3rd niche on the left of the eastern side of the porch is a statue of John the Evangelist, this inscribed \\"Y:M:A:F:F:C:I:\\". In the fifth niche on the left of the eastern side is a statue of Andrew the Apostle inscribed \\"F:B:A:F:FD:\\" and finally on the west side in the third niche from the left is a depiction of Thomas the Apostle. The donor is not indicated. Then in the fifth niche on the left of the western side of the porch there is a statue of Jesus Christ (Christ sauveur). The inscription here is \\"G:B:A:F:C:I:\\" All are in Kersanton stone and all came from Roland Doré's workshop. The \\"Rosary\\" altarpiece The altarpiece in the Rosary Chapel has a painting in the centre depicting Christ and his mother handing the rosary to Saint Dominic and Saint Catherine and a little higher up the same theme is depicted in stone, the statues being very large. Below, in the antependium, there is a bas-relief depicting the Annunciation. External decoration The church has some interesting external decoration. Two examples are shown below.

A cavalier draws his sword. The Le Tréhou calvary The calvary dates to 1578 and stands on a square block of yellowish Logonna stone which could have served as a table to receive offerings (table d’offrande) but a smaller square stands on it and carries bas-relief carvings depicting the apostles, each with his attribute. The cross rises from this smaller square, the shaft bearing the small nodules meant to simulate the bubons or boils which were a symptom of the bubonic plague. Such crosses were invariably erected to mark the end of an epidemic of this disease. In an unusual construction, the crosses of the two robbers crucified with Jesus are shown under the cross bearing Jesus. At the base of the cross there is a statue of Mary Magdalene who is on her knees praying and looking up to the crucified Jesus who hangs from his cross at the top of the shaft. Other statues include Saint Pitère, a pietà and Saint Peter. A demon hovers near the bad robber, waiting to take his soul to hell whilst an angel is near to the good robber who clearly can expect a more acceptable fate.

On either side of the central painting are large statues of the Virgin Mary and Saint Peter. The baptistry The baptistry is an elaborate Baroque work with four Corinthian columns. Over the font is a star-like structure (une Gloire) containing a triangle in which the name of God in Hebrew is inscribed, whilst to the rear there is a painting of John the Baptist baptizing Jesus. This is inscribed in Latin with words that translate as: \\"No one can enter the Kingdom of God without being born of water and the Spirit\\" (John 3:5).

Prelude The Fight on Čelopek (April 16, 1905), fought between 120 Serbian guerillas and Ottoman officers accompanied by Ottoman Albanian bashi-bozuks, ended in a great victory after the guerillas managed to overtake three peaks; the Ottomans had over 200 dead and wounded, while the guerillas only had 2 dead.; ; The victory enraged the Ottomans, who began manhunting the rebels. The rebels were forced to retreat across the border, and the bands were subsequently dispersed. The bands intended to cross Ibarski Kolašin, Prizrenska Gora, Šar Mountains and Suva Planina to their respective areas. The journey of Lazar Kujundžić's band proved catastrophal. Fighting The group of 7 fighters, led by vojvoda Lazar Kujundžić, vojvoda Savatije Milošević and sub-lieutenant Živojin Milovanović, arrived at night-time at the village of Velika Hoča near Prizren. This group returned to the field having crossed Kuršumlija, Podujevo, Ibarski Kolašin and Podrima. The group's leader, teacher Kujundžić, excellently knew the customs and language of the Albanians. Velika Hoča was a Serbian village with only two Albanian tower houses (kule). In order to prevent revenge of the Albanians on the Velika Hoča Serbs, Kujundžić chose to pay tribute to one of the Albanian houses, whose host gave him his word (besa). As the Chetniks had supper and fell asleep, the Albanian notified the Albanians of nearby Orahovac. A mob of 1,500 Albanians, and some Ottoman soldiers, surrounded the house. The Ottoman yuzbashi (captain) called for the Chetniks to give themselves up, to which the Chetniks answered with a bullet hail, killing the captain and four askeri. The fusillade continued over the day, until dusk, when a group of Albanians broke into the lower floor, which, as in all kule, was the stable for cattle. They shot through the ceiling, managing to kill five of the Chetniks, then set the house on fire. The remaining two jumped out of the house shooting, but were instantly killed. According to documents of the Consulate in Pristina, more than 40 Albanians and Ottoman soldiers died during the fight. Lazar Kujundžić.jpgLazar Kujundžić Žika Milovanović (1884-1905).jpgŽivojin Milovanović Aftermath and legacy The Ottomans brought Jadranka, the mother of Kujundžić, to recognize his body. She replied that her son was a daskal (teacher), and no kaçak (outlaw), and that the body was somebody else. Inspired by this event, count Ivo Vojnović wrote a drama in verse, Lazarevo Vaskrsenje (\\"Lazar's Resurrection\\"). Serbian major and Chetnik vojvoda Božin Simić cited that Kujundžić's mother's words were: \\"No, that is not my son. I was unlucky to have not given birth to such a hero.\\" (Ne to nije moj sin. Ja nisam imala sreću da rodim takvog junaka). Serbian major Milosav Jelić, a journalist and Chetnik, published the poem Kujundžića majka (\\"Kujundžić's Mother\\") in the collection of Srbijanski venac. Serbian history books about the Serbian Chetnik Organization call the group heroes.

Background Nadira was the wife of Dara Shikoh, who served as the governor of Lahore in the 1640s. In 1659, Dara was fighting his brother Aurangzeb for the Mughal throne. After Dara's defeat in the Battle of Deorai, he and his wife tried to flee to Iran through the Bolan Pass, but Nadira died of dysentery and exhaustion. Though Dara's troops were depleted, he sent his remaining soldiers to carry his wife's body from the pass to Lahore, to be buried near the shrine of Mian Mir, whom both considered to be their \\"spiritual guide\\". History The tomb is believed to have been robbed of all costly marbles and semi-precious stones during Ranjit Singh's rule, leaving it in a \\"dilapidated\\" state. The tomb is also a prey to \\"contemporary vandalism\\" which is evident from the gaudy graffiti on the mausoleum \\"with the ugly plague of wall chalking\\". Architecture Unlike other Mughal tombs, which are built in gardens, this tomb does not have a dome and was built in a sunken water tank. The tomb stands at the center of the tank on a raised platform . The tank was \\"200 by 200 Mughal gaz in size\\". Later, however the tank was converted into a Mughal garden. The corners of the tank were denoted by pavilions and the tomb could be accessed through \\"lofty gateways\\" on the north and south through a masonry bridge. The bridge stands on thirty arches. The central chamber is 14 feet wide and is surrounded by an ambulatory. The square tomb measures 44 feet on each side and is 32 ft 6 in tall. The first storey is 13 feet and surrounded by square headed apertures. The stairs for reaching the upper storey are located in the northeast and southeast corners. The grave is 6 ft 10 in long, 2 ft 10 in wide and 1 ft 8 in high. Quranic verses are inscribed in Nastaliq script on a marble slab on the northern face of the grave.

He was killed in the Battle of Cape Matapan. Early life and career Cattaneo was born in Sant'Anastasia, Naples, in 1883, and after attending the Naples Military College he entered the Italian Naval Academy at Livorno in 1902; he graduated in 1906, becoming an ensign.Carlo Cattaneo on the site of the Italian Navy He joined the crew of the battleship Ammiraglio di Saint Bon, with which he took part in the rescue operations after the 1908 Messina earthquake. After becoming a sub-lieutenant, he served on the battleship Regina Elena. He took part in the Italo-Turkish War as commanding officer of a landing party which participated in the occupation of Tripoli; for this action, he was awarded a Silver Medal of Military Valor. In 1913 he was promoted to lieutenant, and during World War I he commanded the torpedo boat Orsa, which served intensely in the southern Adriatic Sea, gaining a Bronze Medal of Military Valor in July 1915, and later he served on board destroyers, including Carabiniere. In 1919 he was awarded a second Silver Medal. In January 1920 he was appointed Naval Attaché in Constantinople and later in the same year he was promoted to lieutenant commander. In 1929 he served at the Ministry of the navy, and later he was promoted to commander and appointed Naval Attaché first in Romania and later in Jugoslavia. In 1932 he was promoted captain, commanding, between December 1933 and April 1935, the light cruiser Di Giussano. In 1937 he became rear admiral (Contrammiraglio) and in March 1938 he was promoted vice admiral (Ammiraglio di divisione). World War II After the beginning of World War II, on 26 May 1940, Cattaneo became commander of the 3rd Naval Division, with flag on the heavy cruiser Trento. He took part in this role in the Battle of Calabria on 9 July 1940, after which he was awarded the Silver Medal of Military Valor for the third time. On 30 August 1940 Cattaneo was appointed commander of the 6th Naval Division, with flag on the battleship Duilio, and on 16 December of the same year (after Duilio had been damaged by the raid on Taranto and the Italian battle fleet had been re-organized) he became commander of the 1st Naval Division, with Zara as flagship. In this role, Cattaneo took part in the Battle of Cape Matapan on 27–29 March 1941. Having been initially ordered to carry out a raid against shipping north of Crete, together with the 8th Naval Division of Admiral Antonio Legnani (who was subordinate to him), Cattaneo subsequently received order to abort the raid and join forces with the main force of Admiral Angelo Iachino, with the battleship Vittorio Veneto and the 3rd Naval Division of Admiral Luigi Sansonetti.Giuseppe Fioravanzo, “La Marina italiana nella seconda guerra mondiale – Volume II La guerra nel Mediterraneo – Tomo II, Le azioni navali dal 10.6.1940 al 31.3.1941”, USMM, Roma 1962, pages 382 to 504 Cattaneo's force did not manage to reach Iachino's squadron in time for joining the first engagement against the light cruisers of British Admiral Henry Pridham-Wippell, which took place off Gavdos in the morning of 27 March. The reunion happened shortly after the action off Gavdos had ended. During the afternoon, Cattaneo's ships, like the rest of the Italian squadron, were repeatedly attacked by British planes but suffered no damage. After the Vittorio Veneto was torpedoed and damaged at 15.09, Cattaneo was ordered to form with his ships (the heavy cruisers Zara, Pola and Fiume and the destroyer Vittorio Alfieri, Alfredo Oriani, Vincenzo Gioberti and Giosuè Carducci of the 9th Destroyer Squadron) a line to the port of the damaged battleships, to protect her from further air strikes. At 19.50, a new torpedo bomber attack left Pola dead in the water. Cattaneo proposed Iachino to send two destroyers to her rescue, but Iachino instead ordered him to go back to assist Pola with the entire 1st Division and the 9th Destroyer Squadron. After some hesitation, Cattaneo turned back with his ships to assist Pola at 21.06. In a decision that would be strongly criticized afterwards, Cattaneo kept the four destroyers of the 9th Squadron astern of his cruisers, instead of ahead of them, which would have been more logical and safe, by creating a destroyer screen for his cruisers sailing in the night while their fleet was probably being pursued by enemy ships. Later research however revealed that this tactical fault was not due to a mistake made by Cattaneo, but to the Italian Navy rules on night navigation which were in force at the time.Francesco Mattesini, “L’operazione Gaudo e lo scontro notturno di Capo Matapan”, USMM, Roma 1998, pages 213–218. Cattaneo was also criticized for the low speed at which he sailed his ships (16 to 22 knots); this was later explained with the destroyers being low on fuel. No explanation has ever been found for his decision to leave his ships' guns unmanned as they steamed into a hostile night. Cattaneo's ships reached Pola at 22.20, but meanwhile, unknowingly to him, also Force A of the Mediterranean Fleet, with the battleships Barham, Valiant and Warspite under the command of Admiral Andrew Browne Cunningham, had reached the area. The British battleships were about to open fire on Pola when they spotted the approaching ships of the 1st Division: without being noticed by the Italian ships, they switched target and opened fire at point blank range (3,500 meters) against Cattaneo's ships, which were taken by surprise. In the ensuing fire action, which lasted five minutes, all of Cattaneo's ships, with the exception of Gioberti, were hit; only Alfieri was able to fight back before being disabled. Gioberti and the damaged Oriani managed to retreat, but all the other ships, including Pola, either sank or were finished off by British destroyers. Cattaneo's flagship, Zara, was hit by four 381 mm salvoes from Warspite, five from Barham and five from Valiant.Francesco Mattesini, “L’operazione Gaudo e lo scontro notturno di Capo Matapan”, USMM, Roma 1998. The hits immediately destroyed the 203 mm turrets before they could be readied to fire, started fires aboard, killed or wounded many crewmembers, disabled the engines and within a few minutes left the cruiser without power and dead in the water. Zara was reduced to a drifting wreck, but her hull had suffered no fatal damage, so the cruiser floated for some hours. Finally, Cattaneo decided to scuttle the ship, fearing that it would otherwise fall into enemy hands; he gathered the surviving crew on the stern and he announced his decision.Arrigo Petacco, Le battaglie navali nel Mediterraneo nella seconda guerra mondiale, Milano, Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, 1976, pp. 121 to 150. As the crew abandoned the ship by jumping into the sea or lowering themselves down to the rafts, a small party of volunteers opened the seacocks and ignited the demolition charges placed in the cruiser's magazines. At the same time, HMS Jervis came near and torpedoed Zara; the cruiser went down at 2.40 on 29 March, after a final large explosion. Admiral Cattaneo, who according to survivors had abandoned the ship without a lifejacket as he had given it to a wounded sailor, disappeared in the sea during the night, like most of Zara's crew. Over 2,300 Italian officers and seamen from the five ships perished in Italy's worst naval defeat. Admiral Cattaneo was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.

Three Weeks in May: Speaking Out On Rape, A Political Art Piece was an extended work of performance art and activism by Suzanne Lacy. The piece took place in Los Angeles, California from May 8 to May 24, 1977. History Lacy designed Three Weeks in May in collaboration with artists Leslie Labowitz, Jill Soderholm, Melissa Hoffman and Barbara Cohen. It was sponsored by the Woman's Building and Studio Watts Workshop. Lacy designed the expanded performance to be a \\"simultaneous juxtaposition of art and non-art activities within an extended time frame, taking place within the context of popular culture.\\" Lacy had a background in the anti-rape movement. The artists employed a mass media performance as a means to make social change through art with Lacy crediting the theories of her former CalArts professor Allan Kaprow, who coined the term \\"happening\\", with informing her art's transition to the public sphere. Media was integral to the performance structure of Three Weeks, both as a means to create a public dialogue about rape and a way to bring disparate nonviolence organizations and ideologies together on a common issue. The media was engaged through press conferences, television programs, and radio talk shows. The City Mall Shopping Center was chosen as the site of an installation piece due to its proximity to Los Angeles City Hall. Two 25-foot maps of the greater Los Angeles Area were used for Three Weeks. On one of the maps, every day Lacy used a large red \\"RAPE\\" stamp to mark locations where rapes from the previous day had been reported. Reports were taken from the Los Angeles Police Department, who assigned an information officer to work with Lacy.David Ng (December 12, 2012), Hammer Museum acquires 'Three Weeks in May' by Suzanne Lacy Los Angeles Times. The second map included rape hotlines and the locations of rape crisis centers. Labowitz organized a performance series addressing rape that was held at lunchtime in the underground City Mall Shopping Center for four consecutive days. She collaborated with different groups for the performances. The Rape was developed in collaboration with Women against Rape, Men against Rape. All Men Are Potential Rapists included two men from the Los Angeles Men's Collective. The performances Myths about Rape and Women Fight Back were done with the help of Woman's Building members. Lacy created the performance installation She Who Would Fly at Garage Gallery for Three Weeks. Over the course of two afternoons, she invited women to voice their experiences with rape. The women then wrote their experiences on paper that was taped to the location where they were sexually assaulted on one of the maps that covered the walls of the small gallery space. Poet Deena Metzger scrawled a description of her rape on one of the walls. She Who Would Fly was opened to the public for an evening and visitors could enter four at a time and read the stories. A winged lamb carcass was suspended from the ceiling and four performers, each having experienced sexual violence, sat silently above the door, naked and covered in red greasepaint. Three Weeks also included a performance piece on the steps of Los Angeles City Hall, a rape \\"speak-out\\", and self-defense classes for women in an attempt to highlight and curb sexual violence against women. Legacy Three Weeks in May prompted the police and the city government to address violence against women openly and to publicize rape hotlines. Lacy and Labowitz continued to collaborate on public art projects, addressing gender violence again that December with their In Mourning and in Rage event. Three Weeks in May was the first of Lacy's large scale public art projects and the strategies that she employed in the piece became characteristic in her later works. In the NWSA Journal, art historian Vivien Green Fryd wrote that Lacy's Three Weeks marked the beginning of New Genre Public Art. In 2012 Lacy modified Three Weeks in May for the Getty Pacific Standard Time Performance Festival in a new project called Three Weeks in January, which continued the dialogue about rape in Los Angeles. It included presentations, conversations, and a performance called Storytelling Rape. This time the map was installed prominently on the Los Angeles Police Department's main campus. Storying Rape: Shame Ends Here grew into another art project produced for the Liverpool Biennial in 2012, promoting a public conversation in the English city about rape violence, education, and prevention. In December 2012 the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles acquired Three Weeks in May. This is now the installations permanent home.

His mother, Madge Adelaide, was the youngest daughter of Kate and Harry Rickards, prominent figures in the theatrical life of Australia. He was educated at Wychwood School, Bournemouth. Harry moved to Australia after his parents' divorce, and in 1923 his mother married John Allan Broadbent, of Windella station, Narrandera, NSW. Harry then preferred to use the name 'Jim Broadbent'.

On 14 May 1932, he won the annual New South Wales Aerial Derby, and then purchased a de Havilland Puss Moth (VH-UQL, named \\"Dabs II\\"). He obtained a commercial licence, and founded Sydney Air Taxis, but all Puss Moths were then grounded, pending accident investigations. He purchased and trained racehorses until the ban was lifted. On 18 March 1933, he won the Victorian Aerial Derby, and then reactivated his air taxi service. On 14 July 1934, he flew a de Havilland Fox Moth (G-ACSW) in the King's Cup Race at Hatfield, and finished in 8th place. Starting on 17 May 1935, he piloted his new Puss Moth (VH-UQO, named \\"Dabs III\\") over 7,140 miles (11,491 km), flying from Adelaide in a clockwise direction round Australia in a time of 3 days 9 hours 54 minutes. On 10 October 1935, he took off from Darwin in his Puss Moth (VH-UQO) in an attempt to break the Australia to England record, but he force landed at Basra, and sold the aircraft locally. On 2 November 1935, he took off from Croydon in Percival Gull Six (VH-UVA) in an attempt to break the England to Australia record, which he achieved after arriving at Darwin after 6 days 21 hours 19 minutes. The record was later broken by Jean Batten, then retaken by Broadbent. He was awarded the Oswald Watt Gold Medal for 1935. On 18 December 1936, he piloted de Havilland Tiger Moth (VH-UVZ) in the South Australia Centenary Air Race, and achieved notoriety through public criticism of the organisers after the event.Chic's WebsiteSouth Australian Aviation Museum SAAM-Profiles-1936-SA-CENTENARY-RACE.pdf On 27 April 1937, he took off from Darwin in his de Havilland Leopard Moth (VH-AHB, named \\"Windella\\") in an attempt to break the Australia to England record, which he achieved after arriving at Lympne Aerodrome after 6 days 8 hours 25 minutes.

On 18 October 1937, he took off from Lympne in his Leopard Moth (VH-AHB) in an attempt to break the England to Australia record, but he ran out of fuel and landed short of Baghdad due to headwinds and dust storms. On 12 March 1938, he took off from Lympne in Percival Vega Gull (G-AFEH, named \\"Sirius\\") in an attempt to break the England to Australia record, but he suffered exhaustion and force landed at Flores Island, Indonesia, damaging the propeller, and causing abandonment of the attempt.

Qantas 1938-1939 In 1938-39, he was employed as First Officer in Short Empire flying boats between Sydney and Singapore for Qantas Empire Airways. World War II Between 1941 and 1943, he served with RAF Ferry Command, ferrying aircraft from Canada and the United States to Britain and to Australia. From 1943 to 1944, he flew Lockheed Model 10 Electras for the allied Directorate of Air Transport. On 21 November 1944, he took off from Sydney (Mascot) Aerodrome in a Lockheed 10 Electra (VH-UZP, named \\"Ansalanta\\") of Ansett Airways on lease to US Army Air Force, carrying American service personnel headed for Townsville. At an altitude of 5,000 feet near Broken Bay, the right engine failed, Captain Broadbent then made an emergency landing on Narrabeen Beach, and the aircraft stopped at the water's edge. Later, sugar was found in the fuel lines, prompting suspicion of sabotage.Plane Forced Down On Narrabeen Bch.

Each handicraft market will have a specific theme: for instance, markets for different seasons or markets for different age groups. The applicant needs to send the host some samples of their artistic works. with a brief introduction. After the selection, the host will invite those who display a suitable style related to their main theme and a need to attend the market, and the application will then succeed.http://www.jccac.org.hk/uploads/jccac/201401/20140127_155125_ZB5U1Y2CQX_f.pdf Example of the online application form.http://www.ahahk.com/2015/02/x.html Development and history With the growth of the handicraft market in Hong Kong, many artists, instead of just having an online shop, are choosing to set up a real shop and take part in handicraft markets.綠色手作大熱 90後發新年財 - 行政人員 - 管理 - 生活副刊 - 經濟通 ET Net. [Accessed 21 Mar. 2015]. With the increased demand for markets, websites have been set up to assemble information about major events and markets. Online platforms Online platforms have become an important tool to promote the handicraft market in Hong Kong. The following are some examples of online platforms: *AHAHK, the Arts and Handicraftsman Association of Hong Kong, set up a Facebook page in April 2010 and officially registered with the government in August 2010. All its operations are supported by a group of volunteers. Its aim is to promote the development of DIY work through the handicraft market and attract more attention from the public. It regularly releases new entries for people to apply. Currently, it is the biggest association related to handicraft making in Hong Kong.http://www.ahahk.com/p/blog-page_7424.html Different news reports in the media have reported on this association.http://www.ahahk.com/2012/01/blog- post_16.html In 2011, the founder and chairman of AHAHK, Eva Long, gave a tutorial on “How to make a paper rabbit” in South China Morning Post. \\"Have a hoppy Lunar New Year!\\".

JCCAC will hold a handicraft fair each quarter at weekends which is a platform for around a hundred people to exchange or sell their handicrafts. Challenges for the handicraft market The development of the handicraft market is in its initial stages, it is not as mature as other places such as Taiwan. The handicraft market in Hong Kong faces three main challenges. One of these is the availability of sites for holding a handicraft market. In contrast to Taiwan, where handicraft markets may be held in parks, a handicraft market in Hong Kong may only be held in certain specified places, and only certain holders are permitted to apply to use these. Lastly, to attract sufficient sellers and buyers to attend the handicraft market may also be a challenge, as the handicraft market in Hong Kong is not as well developed as in certain other places.

Structure  The PAM16 gene is located on the p arm of chromosome 16 at position 13.3 and it spans 11,150 base pairs. The PAM16 gene produces a 15.1 kDa protein composed of 137 amino acids. The structure has been found to contain a 21-residue mitochondrial targeting leader sequence.  Function  The PAM16 gene encodes for a mitochondrial protein with multiple functions. It is responsible for the regulation of ATP- dependent protein translocation into the mitochondrial matrix, inhibition of DNAJC19 stimulation of HSPA9/Mortalin ATPase activity, and granulocyte- macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling. Furthermore, PAM16 plays a role in the import of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins into the mitochondrial matrix and may be important in reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Clinical Significance Mutations in the PAM16 gene has been shown to cause mitochondrial deficiencies and associated disorders. It is mainly associated with Megarbane-Dagher-Melike type spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, which is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by pre- and postnatal short stature, developmental delay, dysmorphic facial appearance, narrow chest, prominent abdomen, platyspondyly, short limbs, and other abnormalities of the skeleton.

Between 1961/2 and 1964 he served as rector of the Leuna-Merseburg \\"Carl Schorlemmer\\" Academy for Chemistry (near Leipzig). Life Rolf Landsberg was the elder of two sons born to the architect Max Landsberg and his wife, the doctor Hedwig Landsberg. Theirs was a prosperous Berlin family. However, Max Landsberg, who had been diagnosed with epilepsy in 1890, died young, in 1930. Rolf began his schooling in Berlin, starting his secondary education at the Heinrich-Kleist- Gymnasium. However, in January 1933 there had been a change of government, and it became increasingly apparent that anti-semitism, which had been a prominent feature of Nazi rhetoric in opposition, was entering the political mainstream. The Landsbergs were Jewish. In 1934 Rolf Landsberg was sent to school in England, where he attended the progressive St Christopher School in Letchworth, to the north of London between 1934 and 1937. Sources differ as to whether his mother and brother accompanied him to England at this stage, but by 1939 all three had emigrated to Britain. He went on to study at University College London, emerging with a Chemistry degree (Bachelor of Science) in 1940. In Britain he later also studied at Aberystwyth, but his academic progress was not uninterrupted. In 1939 Germany invaded Poland and Britain declared war on Germany. At home the British government responded to these developments by identifying as enemy aliens large numbers of Jewish and political refugees who had arrived from Nazi Germany. Landsberg's mother was able to escape to Brazil where she joined her brother who, in 1936, had also fled Germany. Rolf and his brother were both arrested by the British government in 1940, and while his younger brother was interned on the Isle of Man, Rolf was sent to Canada for his internment. In Canada he became associated with the (exiled) German Communist Party. Two years later the political mood had changed and he was returned to Britain where he played an active part in the struggle against Fascism in Europe, and became a co-founder of an exiled London based version of the anti-Nazi Free German Youth (FDJ / Freie Deutsche Jugend) movement. In 1944 he volunteered as an assistant to the British army, with which he worked for the next three years, notably as a simultaneous translator, until September 1947. Postings included Münster and Bielefeld. Towards the end of 1947 Rolf Landsberg relocated full-time to Germany where he obtained a post as an assistant in the Physical Chemistry Institute at the Humboldt University of Berlin, which was in the Soviet occupation zone of what remained of Germany. The division of Berlin seemed at this stage neither so politically absolute nor so physically rigid as it later became, but the basis for a return to one-party government had already been set in place in April 1946 with the contentious merger between the old Communist Party and the Moderate-left SPD. Landsberg joined the newly formed Socialist Unity Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, SED) in 1947, and by 1949, when the Soviet controlled part of Germany was re-founded as the German Democratic Republic, sponsored by and in many respects politically modeled on the Soviet Union, Landsberg was a citizen of the new country, while his younger brother Peter pursued an academic career in England. After three years, in 1950, Ralf Landsberg received his doctorate from the Humboldt for a dissertation supervised by Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer and entitled \\"Potentials in the creation of precipitate membranes\\"\\"Potentiale bei der Bildung von Niederschlagsmembranen\\" The next step in his career involved a move, in 1952, to the Ernst Moritz Arndt University (Greifswald), in the north-east of the country, where he lectured on physical chemistry. This was followed by a longer stint, starting in 1955, in the south, as a lecturer at the Leuna-Merseburg \\"Carl Schorlemmer\\" Academy for Chemistry. It was at Leuna-Merseburg that he received his Habilitation (a higher academic distinction) in 1958/59. On this occasion his dissertation was entitled \\"On the kinetics of concealed processes with nickel and zinc anodes\\"\\"Zur Kinetik der Bedeckungsvorgänge an Nickel- und Zinkanoden\\" In 1959 he became a professor at the same institution. Then, in January 1962, Rolf Landsberg was appointed Rector of the Leuna-Merseburg \\"Carl Schorlemmer\\" Academy for Chemistry in succession to Elmar Profft. Profft himself had been released from the post after less than a year after making known political and ideological differences with The Party over matters including, notably, the Berlin Wall erected suddenly in August 1961. Just two years later, in 1964, he returned to the Humboldt University of Berlin, accepting the chair for Physical Chemistry, also becoming Director of the Humboldt's Physical Chemistry Institute. His predecessor's academic career (followed a few months later by his party membership) had been abruptly terminated following a series of lectures in 1963/64 which had been interpreted as a call to remove political dogma from science teaching. In this instance Landsberg's dissident predecessor was Robert Havemann who subsequently gained prominence in various sources on account of the persecution he suffered at the hands of the East German authorities. A particular focus of Landsberg's career in terms of research involved surfaces. That is what he now concentrated on at the Humboldt Physical Chemistry Institute until his retirement in 1985. His many years of teaching in the field of electro-chemistry were crystallised in the book \\"Electro-chemical Reactions and Processes\\" (1977).\\"Elektrochemische Reaktionen und Prozesse\\" He continued to play an active role in scientific life after his retirement, and was a board member of the Leibniz Society in Berlin which he had joined in 1993. He was also a member of the German Academy of Sciences.

From 2013 to 2016 she was a Research Astronomer at the Australian Astronomical Observatory (AAO). Her principal field of research concerns how galaxies form, how they create new stars, and particularly why they suddenly stop creating new stars. She is better known to the public through her efforts in outreach and education. Early life and education Bauer grew up in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. She had an interest in astronomy since she was young, and enjoyed the math club in high school, but at the time she did not consider that these could be a career. In college, at the University of Cincinnati, she initially majored in French, but she changed to Science after trying unsuccessfully to arrange to study abroad. Her college did not have an Astronomy department, so instead she majored in Physics. While pursuing her undergraduate degree, she undertook a student internship with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey from 2000 to 2002. She graduated with a Bachelor of Science with High Honors in Physics from the University of Cincinnati in 2002. Bauer immediately started her master's degree in Astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin. This was where she started her involvement with the area that would become the major focus of her research career: galaxy assembly and evolution. She graduated as a Master of Science in 2004 and began studying for a PhD in Astrophysics, still at the University of Texas at Austin. This included working as a Research Associate at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany in 2006, and at the Gemini Observatory in Chile in 2007. She was awarded her PhD in 2008, with her thesis entitled Star-Forming Galaxies Growing Up Over the Last Ten Billion Years. Research career After completing her PhD, Bauer accepted a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Nottingham in England (September 2008 - November 2010). When that finished, she moved to Australia to take up a three-year ARC \\"Super Science Fellowship\\", working at the AAO. A galaxy's position within a cluster such as this (Abell 2261) affects how it can form new stars. At the conclusion of that fellowship in November 2013, Bauer took up the role of Research Astronomer at the AAO. Her area of research investigates the processes by which galaxies form, and particularly why they eventually stop creating new stars. In order to explore how galaxies build into the diverse structures we see today, she analyzes systematic surveys of hundreds of thousands of galaxies, looking for clues that indicate what physical processes regulate the rates at which new stars are formed in galaxies which are subjected to different conditions. In 2012, she published her findings from a study into the evolution of stars within galaxies which themselves are members of galaxy clusters, using the Gemini North Observatory in Hawaii. The research found that a galaxy's position within the galactic cluster affected stellar evolution within that galaxy: the closer a galaxy is to the center of a cluster, the sooner it stops forming new stars. The interpretation of this is that near the centre of the cluster, the large number of close galactic neighbours influence each other through gravitation to produce a sea of hot gas, and that hot gas seems to be the limiting factor that constrains new star formation. Mergers of galaxies also play a part: her forecasts of how our own Milky Way galaxy will merge with the Andromeda Galaxy and the two smaller Magellanic Cloud galaxies in several billion years have prompted further new studies into how that will affect the rates of star formation locally. , Cornell University's arXiv service lists 61 publications of her astronomical research in peer-reviewed journals, mostly in the categories of either Astrophysics of Galaxies or Cosmology. She has presented her findings at international professional conferences and institutions, including the Annual Science Meeting of the Astronomical Society of Australia in July 2011, Adler Planetarium, Chicago, in September 2013 and the AusGO (Australian Gemini Office) Observational Techniques Workshop in April 2014. Public outreach Amanda Bauer giving a public presentation in November 2014. Amanda Bauer (on ukulele) and Fred Watson (on guitar) provide a musical interlude at the 2014 celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the AAT. Bauer started her involvement with organized public outreach in a project called Sixty Symbols of Physics and Astronomy during her postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Nottingham in England. She contributed regular interviews to this series from 2009 to 2011. After leaving Nottingham, she continued her outreach activities informally with her \\"Astropixie\\" blog. In 2013 while she was working at the AAO, in addition to her research role, Bauer became the first official Outreach Officer for the AAO. The objective of this role is \\"to develop strategies to capture and communicate the excitement of new astronomical discoveries and innovative engineering feats occurring within the AAO and the astronomical community.\\" She manages the AAO's online presence, especially social media using its Facebook, Twitter (@AAOastro) and YouTube channel, and the AAO's growing collection of online videos for the public. She also works with more conventional media by acting as the AAO's media contact and issuing press releases, edits the AAO Observer newsletter, gives public talks, writes science articles for several publications, visits schools, talks to members of parliament, and curated a public photographic exhibition. The importance of her outreach role became particularly apparent in January 2013 when bush-fires threatened the astronomical installations on top of Siding Spring mountain: Bauer was the media contact ensuring that the latest information was available. Since March 2012, Bauer has been a regular expert co-host on the Titanium Physicists Podcast. In March 2017, she started a new podcast, Cosmic Vertigo with co-host Dr Alan Duffy. Bauer is a regular guest on ABC Radio and ABC News television, a guest writer for Australian Sky & Telescope magazine, guest writer and astronomy contact for Cosmos magazine, featured astrophysicist in video series Deep Sky Videos and Sixty Symbols of Physics and Astronomy. Her live presentations have been in front of the public, astronomical organizations and school groups, with audiences up to 350 people at the Australian Skeptics National Convention in November 2014. She teaches the \\"Scientists in Schools\\" program for 8- to 12-year-old students, and \\"CAASTRO in the Classroom\\" astronomy lessons to about 100 students. In her spare time, she also maintains her own \\"astropixie\\" blog and Twitter feed about astronomy. She also takes an active role in helping other astronomers to develop their own skills in science communication, by conducting workshops and giving talks to professionals, including the ASA Harley Wood School in July 2014, the AAO Colloquium on Outreach in March 2014, and \\"dotAstronomy: Networked Astronomy and New Media\\" in Boston in September 2013. She is the Director of \\"dotAstronomy 7\\" which will be held in Sydney in November 2015. In 2014 the Astronomical Society of Australia acknowledged her contributions to public outreach by electing her to the Steering Committee of its Education and Public Outreach Chapter (EPOC) for a two-year term. In early 2017, Bauer moved back the US and joined the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope as Head of Education and Public Outreach. Personal life Bauer enjoys live acoustic music, camping, hiking, and swimming. She says that \\"the best of all worlds is when she goes camping at music festivals, enjoying the companionship, the great music, the campfires, and sleeping under the stars.\\" In February 2016, she gave birth to a daughter, Ida Luna.

Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca cheelii was first formally described in 1932 by Cyril Tenison White in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Queensland collected by White himself at \\"Traverston, mouth of the Burrum River, about 180 miles north of Brisbane, Queensland\\" noting that it was \\"common in wet places in sandy wallum country\\". The specific epithet (cheelii) honours Edwin Cheel (1872– 1951) who was a botanist at the state herbarium in Sydney. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in wallum country near Bundaberg including in Burrum Coast National Park and the Meadowvale Nature Park in Bundaberg. Conservation status This species has been classified as \\"near threatened\\" under the Government of Queensland Nature Conservation (Wildlife) Amendment Regulation (2010). Use in horticulture Although not well known in cultivation, a specimen in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra is more than 20 years old. Others have grown successfully in Adelaide and Brisbane.

The group, which has included A.K. Burns, K8 Hardy, Lise Soskolne, and A.L. Steiner, grew out of a series of informal gatherings that evolved into a series of public meetings centering on issues of art and labor. Early activity focused on education and consciousness raising about economic inequity in the form of videos, open teach-ins, workshops, panel discussions and symposia at museums, galleries, conferences, festivals, schools, summits, and art fairs. In 2010, W.A.G.E. narrowed its platform to focus on the regulated payment of artist fees by nonprofit arts organizations and museums. They also initiated the 2010 W.A.G.E. Artist Survey to gather data about the payment practices of New York City nonprofits. In Fall 2010, New Museum curator, Lauren Cornell, invited W.A.G.E. to participate in the 2010-2011 group exhibition, 'Free'. W.A.G.E., identifying not as an art-making collective, but rather as an activist group, opted to participate by negotiating artist fees on behalf of everyone in the exhibition, marking the event as \\"the first experimental platform for W.A.G.E. Certification\\". In 2011, W.A.G.E. received its 501c3 non-profit status and narrowed its focus to W.A.G.E. Certification, a voluntary certification program that publicly recognizes nonprofit institutions paying artist fees meeting a minimum payment standard. In March 2011, W.A.G.E. formed a temporary research partnership with Artists Space. This partnership served as a cooperative platform for hosting series of public programs and developing W.A.G.E. Certification. The first in the series, \\"Feeling the Shape of the Arts Economy\\", took place at Artists Space on January 9, 2012, and was led by sociologist and economist Hans Abbing, author of Why Are Artists Poor: The Exceptional Economy of the Arts. Other symposia included, \\"Marion von Osten: Be Creative! With responses from Andrew Ross\\" on November 8, 2012. Artists Space also granted W.A.G.E. access to their financial history, thus facilitating the organization's first case study of artist fee payment practices. In 2012, the results of the W.A.G.E. Artist Survey were released. W.A.G.E. Certification was developed into a policy and regulatory tool in January 2014 at the 2014 W.A.G.E. Summit and was launched in October. Summit participants included: A.K. Burns, Howie Chen, Andrea Fraser, Alison Gerber, Stephanie Luce, Andrew Ross (sociologist), Lise Soskolne, Marina Vishmidt, and staff members of Artists Space. The Summit also marked the conclusion of W.A.G.E.'s Research Partnership with Artists Space. W.A.G.E. Artist Survey The purpose of the W.A.G.E. Survey was to gather data about the economic experiences of artists exhibiting in non-profit exhibition spaces in New York City between 2005 and 2010. Launched on September 22, 2010, the survey remained open until May 1, 2011. It collected responses anonymously about forms of payment, compensation or reimbursement received by an artist for their participation in an exhibition, including information about installation expenses, shipping/transportation costs for works, material expenses, and travel expenses, among other things. The results of the survey, released in 2012, found that 58 percent of the 577 survey respondents who exhibited with small, medium, and large non-profit arts institutions in New York’s five boroughs between 2005 and 2010 did not receive any form of payment, compensation, or reimbursement––including the coverage of any expenses. W.A.G.E. Certification W.A.G.E. Certification is a voluntary program that publicly recognizes non-profit arts organizations demonstrating a commitment to ethical payment practices with the artists they contract. W.A.G.E. Certification mandates that artists be compensated for the content they provide for the programs of arts institutions, and that this compensation must meet a minimum payment standards, as defined by the W.A.G.E. Fee Calculator. The initiative is closely modeled after the Canadian Artists' Representation/Le Front des artistes Canadiens (CARFAC) Minimum Fee Schedule, and advocates for many of the same bottom-up tactics for shifting the relations between artists and institutions. However, unlike CARFAC, which has support from the Canadian government through the provision of the Exhibition Right in the Copyright Act, W.A.G.E.'s model has no state supported mandate, and currently relies on organizations opting in or on large groups of artists opting out of working with arts organizations that aren't W.A.G.E. certified. Definitions & Requirements W.A.G.E. Certification advocates for hyper definition and clarity, and has set definitions and requirements for the following: artist, non-profit arts organization, artist fee, basic programming costs and services, production costs, fee categories, and fee calculation. =Artist= Artist refers to \\"all those who supply content and services in a non-profit visual arts presenting context.\\" No distinction is made between individual and collective/collaborative providers. W.A.G.E. does distinguish between the \\"contracted artist\\" and a \\"sub-contracted artist\\". =Non-Profit Arts Organization= Non-profit arts organization refers to a \\"501(c)3 tax exempt arts organization or institution that produces programs and exhibitions for a viewing public in a visual arts presenting context\\". Participating institutions could include 501(c)3 museums, advocacy organizations, professional societies, mid-size institutions, private foundations, artist-run initiatives, project spaces, independent websites, and publications. =Artist Fee= W.A.G.E. defines artistic labor as no different from other forms of subcontracted labor, and designates artist fees as compensation for content and services that are \\"distinct and separate from basic programming costs and services, production expenses, or the purchase of art works\\". In addition, the payment of artist fees does not imply the transfer of rights; must meet the minimum standard as determined by the W.A.G.E. fee calculator; and must be listed as its own distinct visible line item in an organization's exhibition and operating budgets. =Fee Categories= W.A.G.E. has identified fourteen categories of commonly supplied content or services: 1) Solo Exhibition, 2) Solo Project, 3) Two-Person Exhibition, 4) Group Exhibition, 3-5 Artists, 5) Group Exhibition, 6+ Artists, 6) Performance of Existing Work, 7) Performance, Commission of New Work, 8) Solo Screening with In-Person Appearance, 9) Event with 2 or More Participants, 10) Artist Talk or Reading, 11) Lecture, 12) Existing Text for Publication, 13) Commissioned Text for Publication, 14) Day Rate for Performers. =Fee Calculation= W.A.G.E. Certification's fee calculator is a model used to determine fair compensation for the fourteen fee categories. Fees are based on an organization’s total annual operating expenses (TAOE) and are broken down into three tiers: * Floor W.A.G.E. - used to determine a minimum wage for organizations with TAOE below $500,000. * Minimum W.A.G.E. - used to determine a rate for organizations with TAOE above $500,000. * Maximum W.A.G.E. - used to determine a specified maximum rate, or cap, for organizations with TAOE over $15,000,000.

Khera started at ICICI Bank in 1993, where he worked in several banking roles until 2005, after which he founded FINO Paytech in 2006. FINO is India's largest banking correspondent network serving over 70 million customers[1] and has recently become FINO Payments Bank. Later, he invested in YTS Solutions,[2] a venture focused on serving banking deprived customers in India. He applied for a Small Finance Bank license to RBI in 2014 to deepen the financial inclusion in India. In 2015, he became the CEO of Airtel Money Services Limited and laid the foundation for converting it to Airtel Payments Bank. He is now working on a digital micro-lending solution, Happy, a brand of Arth Impact Finserve. The targeted audience for the types of loans offered by this new service consists of micro-entrepreneurs and migrants or semi-skilled workers. Khera was selected as the Young Global Leader of 2011 by the World Economic Forum while being cited as a serial entrepreneur by YourStory, and was interviewed by Entrepreneur India on 'Technology Inducing Multifaceted Changes In Lending Space' and MoneyControl for 'Fintech players tap technology to aid financial inclusion'. Education Khera is an electrical engineer from Delhi College of Engineering (then a constituent college of the University of Delhi, now the Delhi Technological University), having a Master's Degree in Business Administration (Finance) from the Faculty of Management Studies, University of Delhi, along with an M.Phil. in Environment and Development from the University of Cambridge in the U.K. He is also a Department for International Development scholar. The Department for International Development (DFID), established in the United Kingdom, is responsible for administering overseas aid, aiming to promote sustainable development while trying to eradicate world poverty.  Career   Years with ICICI Bank (1993–2006)  In 2004, after gaining experience in corporate and structured lending, and transaction banking and banking technology, Manish set up the Alternate Channels Group (ACG) within ICICI Bank to serve the need and opportunity of offering banking services to the banking deprived in India. ACG's objective was to find unconventional and alternate channels to provide banking services to the unserved segment. During this period, he also worked with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to get the Business Correspondent guidelines issued working with Khan Committee, which gave recommendations for this pioneering change of financial inclusion initiative in India.[5] At the Alternate Channels Group, Manish designed a system that leveraged biometric paperless technology and no physical infrastructure to reach the unserved and underbanked population in India. That laid the foundation for Financial Information Network and Operations Ltd. (FINO), which was later renamed FINO Paytech.  Years with FINO Paytech Limited (2005–2013)  FINO Paytech Ltd. was founded in 2006 by Manish Khera. He was Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of the company. In 2006, Manish combined low-cost innovation aligned with customer ability and skill sets, the lack of infrastructure in India and the radical move by RBI to permit Business Correspondents to solicit and service customers, to successfully deliver banking services for the micro-segment (below poverty line population) along with business profitability. This endeavor has been one of the most appreciated success stories in the micro segment category. His thought and innovative approach to the business has encouraged other players in the field to come up and create value chains for their customers of the same segment. Under his leadership, FINO grew to service over 70 million customers across more than 50,000 Business Correspondent points making it the largest globally. FINO has now become FINO Payments Bank.  Years with YTS – Yatra Tatra Sarvatra (2014–present)  After the success of FINO Paytech Ltd., Manish invested in Yatra Tatra Sarvatra (YTS) in 2014. The USP of YTS was its ubiquitous services. YTS operated on a mobile banking platform that assisted migrant customers in remitting money instantaneously across the country at a low cost and in carrying out their banking transactions using a low cost phone. This USP was the inspiration for the name. In Sanskrit Yatra Tatra Sarvatra translates to Here There Everywhere. YTS had laid good foundation working with the migrant population who relocated from rural to urban India. Looking at the good solution set developed by YTS and the rapid business scale, Airtel acquired the remittance and payments business of YTS and has not been operational since 2015. Manish became the CEO of Airtel Money Services Limited and in a period of 10 months, he tripled the business volume and revenue that had been stagnant for the previous two years. He laid the foundation of and converted Airtel Money into Airtel Payments Bank. Manish Khera was an applicant of the Small Finance Bank under RBI guidelines along with 72 others. Though his application was not successful, he continues his pursuit of becoming a small finance bank.  ArthImpact (founded 2016)  In December 2016 Manish founded ArthImpact, a digital micro-lending fintech company which would facilitate financial inclusion across socio-economic segments. His intention for ArthImpact is to make money management simpler for customers – be it digital natives or marginal grass root communities. Via ArthImpact, Manish aims to reach out to 600 million people in India who do not have access to mainstream banking. This formed the genesis of the idea and the drive that led to ArthImpact being founded. As a banking veteran specializing in Micro Finance, Khera understood that micro customers are not always on the lookout for large value loans. They are more interested in a solution that could solve their everyday cash mismatch problems. ArthImpact endeavours to be the solution here with digital banking solutions for micro customers like merchants, housewives and students who may not have access to mainstream banking for micro credits. The credit ranges from INR 2,000 to INR 100,000, and is allotted to customers depending on their repayment capacity. ArthImpact launched a micro lending product as Happy Loans – an everyday financial adviser to its users. It is designed to make the transaction of lending instant, that including disbursing credit and receiving the credit repayment digitally. The whole process is 100% paperless with zero manual intervention. While it offers end-to-end digital micro lending services to 600mn Indians who do not have access to mainstream banking, at the same time it also helps merchants in building their credit rating by adopting a disciplined repayment pattern. Awards and recognition Khera is an advocate of socially relevant businesses that are also financially viable. He has received praise for his role as one of the thought leaders in the financial inclusion and micro- finance space in India. He has been honored and recognized as \\"Young Global Leader of 2011\\" by World Economic Forum. Manish has also been recognized by E&Y; as the \\"Entrepreneur of the Year 2011\\" and has been awarded the Forbes India Leadership award 2012 for the \\"Outstanding Start-Up\\".

He was known for involvement in shows such as The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin, Father Knows Best, I Dream of Jeannie, and Mannix. He was also the older brother of Rowe Wallerstein. Career Wallerstein's career began as assistant director for TV's The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin in 1954. After two years, Wallerstein left Tin Tin and had several assistant directing stints in several movies before being hired to the directing staff of the television series Circus Boy. He also served as a director on the television series Star Trek in the 1960s. He also had producing credits for I Dream of Jeannie and several television movies in the 1970s. In 1978, Wallerstein began working for 20th Century Fox. He served as the senior vice president of feature film production. He oversaw the production of films such as Alien, 9 to 5 and The Verdict. He retired from Fox in the winter 1984. Death On the evening of September 27, 1985, Wallerstein went to the supermarket. When he returned, he and the family housekeeper, Mayra Melenez Lopez, an immigrant from El Salvador, had a struggle. According to Lopez, Wallerstein had assaulted her several times that night. Lopez claimed he had thrown ice cream in her face and pummeled her repeatedly, giving her a black eye. After that, Lopez arose from the kitchen floor and proceeded to hit Wallerstein in the head with a baseball bat. To cover up the slaying, Lopez and her boyfriend dragged Wallerstein's body to the boyfriend's car and drove two blocks. The car was then set ablaze and was discovered by firefighters on September 29. On November 26, 1985, Lopez was arrested and, on the 28th, arraigned on murder. According to Los Angeles Police Detective Joseph Diglio, Lopez was a suspect from the beginning of the investigation. Her arrest came after several personal objects of Wallerstein's, including his wallet, identification and credit cards, were found buried near the Wallerstein home. On December 11, 1985, a preliminary hearing for Lopez was held at the Van Nuys Municipal Court. Superior Court Judge James A. Albracht reduced Lopez's charge from murder to manslaughter ruling that \\"...the prosecution had presented insufficient evidence ... to show that Lopez had acted with premeditation and malice.\\" Lopez's trial was held in July 1986. After two and a half days of deliberation, on July 16, a jury at the Van Nuys superior court found Lopez not guilty of voluntary and involuntary manslaughter and charges of arson in Wallerstein's death. Lopez then reportedly placed her head in the chest of her lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Mark Lessom and whispered \\"Thank you\\".

Born in Restormel, Cornwall, and growing up with eight brothers and sisters, she converted to Catholicism in 1844. She married Daniel Parsons in 1845, himself a recent convert to Catholicism, and the couple moved to Malvern Wells. There she wrote several novels, generally with underlying Catholic themes. She also started a Catholic periodical in 1865, which lasted just one year. Life Gertrude Hext was born in Restormel, Cornwall, on 19 March 1812. Her father Captain John Hext, an army officer, and mother, Elizabeth Hext, had nine children, Gertrude was their fourth. She converted to the Roman Catholic faith in 1844 before she married Daniel Parsons, son of the vicar of Sherborne the following year. Her husband was a curate who had converted to Catholicism in 1843. The couple moved to Malvern Wells after they were married, and Gertrude Parsons became a benefactor of the mission at Little Malvern. Works Parson wrote several novels which all had underlying Catholic themes. For example, in Thornberry Abbey, a couple finding happiness in converting to Catholicism, whilst in Edith Mortimer, a girl who turns down her suitor because he is a Protestant. She also wrote Rhymes Gay and Grave in 1864. The following year Parsons edited and largely wrote a magazine for Catholics called Workman, or, Life and Leisure and later the Literary Workman in 1865. The magazine failed to get a loyal readership and the initially weekly but later monthly publication ceased in the same year as it was launched. Parson's later works were simple romances which did not have the religious ties.

Description  Fossil flipper The type species, Atocetus iquensis, is known from Serravallian-age strata of the Pisco Formation of Peru,De Muizon, 1988, p.131 while A. nasalis is known from Tortonian-age marine deposits in California.L. G. Barnes. 1985. The Late Miocene dolphin Pithanodelphis Abel, 1905 (Cetacea: Kentriodontidae) from California. Contributions in Science 367:1-27. Barnes (1985) originally described the latter as a species of Pithanodelphis, but it was eventually transferred to Atocetus by Muizon (1988). The Miocene delphinidan \\"Champsodelphis\\" fuchsii from marine deposits in Austria was initially tentatively referred to Atocetus based on the discovery of partial skeletons from the Carpathian region with earbones similar to those of Atocetus but was eventually re-assigned to Kentriodon following the discovery of additional earbones from Austria and Romania.E.

Phylogeny  Although Atocetus and other pithanodelphinines are usually assigned to Kentriodontidae, the cladistic analysis of Lambert et al. (2017) showed that Atocetus and Pithanodelphis form a clade with Tagicetus and Lophocetus that is not only phylogenetically more derived than other kentriodontids but is also phylogenetically intermediate between the baiji and members of Inioidea and Phocoenidae.Olivier Lambert, Giovanni Bianucci, Mario Urbina, Jonathan H.

It was aired Globo from June 4, 1994 to January 6, 2001. The show is a Brazilian version of Xuxa Park produced by Spain's Tele5 in 1992. The program marked the turn of the host to the children's public, because its previous attraction, the homonym Xuxa (1993), was dedicated to the whole family. Occupying Saturday morning, the program featured jokes, musical numbers, and cartoons. The last program was remembered for the commemoration of the day of kings exhibited on January 6, 2001, that is, the only program of the year, since it was canceled on leaving the air due to the tragic fire that occurred on January 11, 2001, when would later come to the Carnival special of that year on February 24, 2001.  History   Background  Xuxa Park was hosted by Brazilian superstar Xuxa, an actress, model and singer that became wildly popular with young viewers through her hosting of many similar shows in both Spanish and Portuguese (plus a one- season attempt at breaking into the U.S. television market with a show in English). While hailed by many for her talents and her love of children, she has also been a controversial figure due to her having previously posed for a Playboy magazine centerfold and also having played a prostitute in what some categorize as a \\"soft porn\\" film. She also hosted a more adult TV show concurrent with Xuxa Park—in this show (Planeta Xuxa) she would, among other things, interview guests about their sexual habits. This history has led some to condemn her as an inappropriate role model for children. The show, consisting of games and musical numbers, took place on a colorful, futuristic set full of elaborate rides and props, among which was a mechanical \\"spaceship\\" through which Xuxa would normally enter the set at the start of the show, and leave at the end.  Production  Xuxa Park was recorded entirely in Teatro Fênix, in the neighborhood of the Jardim Botânico in Rio de Janeiro. The initial scenario housed a modern amusement park, full of lights, tunnels, spacecraft and toys that turned in all directions. Xuxa down a lift- shaped flying saucer. In the background, there was a crystal palace. In 1995, the scenarios have been modified. The Crystal Palace, however, continued to be the main reference. In September 1999, the scenarios of Xuxa Park were redesigned, starting with the size. The program began to be recorded in Projac, in the studied area, and the whole studio space was used, leaving only small lateral access. The scene had a futuristic style and its design was based on the proximity of the new millennium.  Format  Xuxa Park was divided into eight blocks, with four hours long and with mixed games, musical numbers and cartoons. The program display time varied over the years. In January 1995, Xuxa Park began to share Saturday morning with the children's TV Colosso (1993), displayed from 10:45. In April 1995, the time has been changed to 9:50 a.m.; and in July 1996, the program was being transmitted from 9am. The opening block Xuxa Park was dedicated to cartoons. The second block was dedicated to the games, usually competitions between boys and girls. In the third block, the Pequenas Crianças, Grandes Talentos, showed children from all over the Brazil, dancing or showing some skill. The room Xuxa Park block had the Canta, Brasil, framework in which Xuxa interviewed a Brazilian idol. Each week, the host received a guest. The fifth block was dedicated again to games, among which stood out Roleta. In the sixth and seventh blocks, the program had the Xuxa Hits, Music charts with the singers and the most played songs of the season.  Cast  The cast of the program, was attended had the participation of Paquitas; the twins Roberta and Mariana Richard, the Irmãs Metralha who also had worked in other programs of the host; and Eugenio Genio (Paolo Pacelli), a new character of the program.  Flash fire  The program was canceled after a tragic fire that occurred on January 11, 2001.

Life Ilić was born in Staro Nagoričane. He became a vojvoda in 1906. Petko Ilić was born in July 1886, in Staro Nagoričane, a Serbian village that is primarily known for its Church of St. George built in 1071 and reconstructed between 1313 and 1318 by Serbian king Stefan Milutin. At the time of Petko Ilić's birth that Christian territory was still under the long occupation of the Ottoman Empire. His inheritance, from generations of Serbian ancestors, was hate of Turkish tyranny and the example of many forefathers who fought against it futilely. When he was six-years-old he saw his family members dragged from home in chains by Turkish soldiers and Bashi- bazouks, lashed and imprisoned, on a charge of treason. As a youngster of 16 in 1903, he joined what he thought was a Serbian četa (band of freedom fighters), led by Valko Mandarčev, a Bulgarian pretending to be a Serb sympathizer. In the winter of 1904 Mandarčev's cheta met the komitadji of Bobi Stojcev, an IMRO commander, near Poreč, they were disarmed and liquidated. Petko Ilić, 17 at the time, was somehow spared and sent to Bulgaria's capital Sofia to be indoctrinated. From Bulgaria Ilić managed to escape and make his way to Vranje in the spring of 1905. There he joined the četa of Anđel Đorđević. Even that četa was ambushed when they crossed the frontier and were suddenly surrounded by Turkish troops. After fierce fighting, most of the četa members were killed with only Petko Ilić and two others left. They bravely confronted the attacking Turks by launching at them with bayonets fixed to the muzzle of their rifles in hand-to-hand combat. When it became evident that the Turks were about to overpower them, Petko decided to explode a bomb. The explosion took the lives of more than a dozen. However, Petko, who was thrown several feet away, was unconscious but not mortally wounded. The remaining Turks did not bother to bury any of the corpses, and left for their garrison. After Ilic came around, he managed to muster enough strength to find his way back to Serbian territory, though wounded. He went on to fight many battles with the Turks and Bulgars under the command of Jovan Dovezenski, had lost several trusted lieutenants, had several more narrow escapes, including having to fight his way with his cheta through a cordon of the enemy. Petko Ilić became a commander (Vojvoda) in 1906 in Skopska Crna Gora, where he organized a communication network between two headquarters. The Bulgarian-sponsored komitadji began terrorizing the nearby Serbian villages and along with Jovan Babunski and a number of other skilled vojvodas fought in this region: Gligor Sokolović, Trenko Rujanović, Jovan Dolgač, Vasilije Trbić, and Cene Marković. Petko and his četa cleared the right bank of the Vardar River, from Skoplje to Veles, and beyond, of Bulgarian komitadji. Subsequently, he headed numerous daring raids into Ottoman territory, fighting the Turks as well. In July 1908, the Young Turks, along with the Turkish Third Army in Macedonia, marched on Istanbul and overthrew the Turkish sultan, Abdul Hamid. He was replaced by his weak brother, Mohammed V. A new constitution was proclaimed. All citizens of Turkey, including the sizable Christian population in the Balkans, were promised full political and religious rights. The old feudal system was abolished. A new era was proclaimed. Everyone in Old Serbia and Macedonia was excited about the great changes that were about to take place. The Young Turks called on everyone to end the civil war and join the new society. Believing the Young Turks, many of the Serbian cetas, the Bulgarian komitadji and the Greek ardante came out of their respective mountain fastness hoping to return to a peaceful life. The Serbian Committee for Chetnik Action came to an understanding with the new government and gave up their arms in Skopije. Petko Ilić was presented to the Turks as a leader of the Chetniks which he was not. Members of the Turkish high command were surprised to find a young man of slight built and short height with such a popular following. They were beside themselves. In 1910 Ilić began to fight the Young Turks after they neglected to observe the promises that they had made to the European Powers to respect the Christian population in their Empire. In 1912, a Bulgarian gunman, a member of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), shot and killed Ilić in the village of Stracin. Ilić was buried in the monastery complex of the Church of St. Panteleimon (Gorno Nerezi), near the Serbian village of Lepučin in the region of northern Macedonia.

Sea navigation was aided by ports and lighthouses. A few advanced cities had aqueducts that serviced public fountains and baths, while fewer had sewers. ;Roads The first roads were tracks that often followed game trails, such as the Natchez Trace.Lay, M G (1992). Ways of the World. Sydney: Primavera Press. pp. 401. . The first paved streets appear to have been built in Ur in 4000 BCE. Corduroy roads were built in Glastonbury, England in 3300 BCELay (1992) and brick-paved roads were built in the Indus Valley Civilisation on the Indian subcontinent from around the same time. In 500 BCE, Darius I the Great started an extensive road system in Persia (Iran), including the Royal Road. With the rise of the Roman Empire, the Romans built roads using deep roadbeds of crushed stone as an underlying layer to ensure that they kept dry. On the more heavily travelled routes, there were additional layers that included six sided capstones, or pavers, that reduced the dust and reduced the drag from wheels. In the medieval Islamic world, many roads were built throughout the Arab Empire. The most sophisticated roads were those of the Baghdad, Iraq, which were paved with tar in the 8th century. ;Canals and irrigation systems The oldest known canals were built in Mesopotamia c. 4000 BCE, in what is now Iraq and Syria. The Indus Valley Civilisation in India and Pakistan from c3300 BCE had a sophisticated canal irrigation system. In Egypt, canals date back to at least 2300 BCE, when a canal was built to bypass the cataract on the Nile near Aswan. In ancient China, large canals for river transport were established as far back as the Warring States (481-221 BCE). By far the longest canal was the Grand Canal of China completed in 609 CE, still the longest canal in the world today at . In Europe, canal building began in the Middle Ages because of commercial expansion from the 12th century. Notable canals were the Stecknitz Canal in Germany in 1398, the Briare Canal connecting the Loire and Seine in France in 1642, followed by the Canal du Midi in 1683 connecting the Atlantic to the Mediterranean. Canal building progressed steadily in Germany in the 17th and 18th centuries with three great rivers, the Elbe, Oder, and Weser being linked by canals.  1700 to 1870  ;Roads As traffic levels increased in England and roads deteriorated, toll roads were built by Turnpike Trusts, especially between 1730 and 1770. Turnpikes were also later built in the United States. They were usually built by private companies under a government franchise. Water transport on rivers and canals carried many farm goods from the US frontier between the Appalachian Mountains and Mississippi River in the early 19th century, but the shorter road route over the mountains had advantages. In France, Pierre-Marie-Jérôme Trésaguet is widely credited with establishing the first scientific approach to road building about the year 1764. It involved a layer of large rocks, covered by a layer of smaller gravel. John Loudon McAdam (1756–1836) designed the first modern highways, and developed an inexpensive paving material of soil and stone aggregate known as macadam. ;Canals In Europe, particularly Britain and Ireland, and then in the early US and the Canadian colonies, inland canals preceded the development of railroads during the earliest phase of the Industrial Revolution. In Britain between 1760 and 1820 over one hundred canals were built. In the United States, navigable canals reached into isolated areas and brought them in touch with the world beyond. By 1825 the Erie Canal, long with 82 locks, opened up a connection from the populated northeast to the fertile Great Plains. During the 19th century, the length of canals grew from to over , with a complex network in conjunction with Canada making the Great Lakes navigable, although some canals were later drained and used as railroad rights-of-way. ;Railways The earliest railways were used in mines or to bypass waterfalls, and were pulled by horses or by people. In 1811 John Blenkinsop designed the first successful and practical railway locomotive, and a line was built connecting the Middleton Colliery to Leeds. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway, considered to be the world's first intercity line, opened in 1826. In the following years, railways spread throughout the United Kingdom and the world, and became the dominant means of land transport for nearly a century. In the US, the 1826 Granite Railway in Massachusetts was the first commercial railroad to evolve through continuous operations into a common carrier. The Baltimore and Ohio, opened in 1830, was the first to evolve into a major system. In 1869, the symbolically important transcontinental railroad was completed in the US with the driving of a golden spike at Promontory, Utah. ;Telegraph service The electrical telegraph was first successfully demonstrated on 25 July 1837 between Euston and Camden Town in London.The electric telegraph, forerunner of the internet, celebrates 170 years BT Group Connected Earth Online Museum. Accessed July 2007 It entered commercial use on the Great Western Railway over the from Paddington station to West Drayton on 9 April 1839. In the United States, the telegraph was developed by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail. On 24 May 1844, Morse made the first public demonstration of his telegraph by sending a message from the Supreme Court Chamber in the US Capitol in Washington, DC to the B&O; Railroad outer depot (now the B&O; Railroad Museum) in Baltimore. The Morse/Vail telegraph was quickly deployed in the following two decades. On 24 October 1861, the first transcontinental telegraph system was established. The first successful transatlantic telegraph cable was completed on 27 July 1866, allowing transatlantic telegraph communications for the first time. Within 29 years of its first installation at Euston Station, the telegraph network crossed the oceans to every continent but Antarctica, making instant global communication possible for the first time.  1870 to 1920  ;Roads Tar-bound macadam, or tarmac, was applied to macadam roads towards the end of the 19th century in cities such as Paris. In the early 20th century tarmac and concrete paving were extended into the countryside. ;Canals Many notable sea canals were completed in this period, such as the Suez Canal in 1869, the Kiel Canal in 1897, and the Panama Canal in 1914. ;Telephone service In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell achieved the first successful telephone transmission of clear speech. The first telephones had no network, but were in private use, wired together in pairs. Users who wanted to talk to different people had as many telephones as necessary for the purpose. A user who wished to speak, whistled into the transmitter until the other party heard. Soon, however, a bell was added for signalling, and then a switch-hook, and telephones took advantage of the exchange principle already employed in telegraph networks. Each telephone was wired to a local telephone exchange, and the exchanges were wired together with trunks. Networks were connected together in a hierarchical manner until they spanned cities, countries, continents, and oceans. ;Electricity At the Paris Exposition of 1878, electric arc lighting had been installed along the Avenue de l'Opera and the Place de l'Opera, using electric Yablochkov arc lamps, powered by Zénobe Gramme alternating current dynamos. Yablochkov candles required high voltages, and it was not long before experimenters reported that the arc lights could be powered on a seven-mile (11 km) circuit. Within a decade scores of cities would have lighting systems using a central power plant that provided electricity to multiple customers via electrical transmission lines. These systems were in direct competition with the dominant gaslight utilities of the period. The first electricity system supplying incandescent lights was built by the Edison Illuminating Company in lower Manhattan, eventually serving one square mile with six \\"jumbo dynamos\\" housed at Pearl Street Station. The first transmission of three-phase alternating current using high voltage took place in 1891 during the International Electro-Technical Exhibition in Frankfurt. A 25 kilovolt transmission line, approximately long, connected Lauffen on the Neckar with Frankfurt. Voltages used for electric power transmission increased throughout the 20th century. By 1914 fifty-five transmission systems operating at more than 70,000 V were in service, the highest voltage then being used was 150,000 V.Bureau of Census data reprinted in Hughes, pp. 282–283 ;Water distribution and sewers In the 19th century major treatment works were built in London in response to cholera threats. The Metropolis Water Act 1852 was enacted. \\"Under the Act, it became unlawful for any water company to extract water for domestic use from the tidal reaches of the Thames after 31 August 1855, and from 31 December 1855 all such water was required to be effectively filtered. The Metropolitan Commission of Sewers was formed, water filtration was made compulsory, and new water intakes on the Thames were established above Teddington Lock. The technique of purification of drinking water by use of compressed liquefied chlorine gas was developed in 1910 by US Army Major Carl Rogers Darnall, Professor of Chemistry at the Army Medical School. Darnall's work became the basis for present day systems of municipal water purification. ;Subways In 1863 the London Underground was created. In 1890, it first started using electric traction and deep-level tunnels. Soon afterwards, Budapest and many other cities started using subway systems. By 1940, nineteen subway systems were in use.  Since 1920  A multi-lane, multi-carriageway freeway ;Roads In 1925, Italy was the first country to build a freeway-like road, which linked Milan to Como,Paul Hofmann, \\"Taking to the Highway in Italy\\", New York Times, 26 April 1987, 23. known as the Autostrada dei Laghi. In Germany, the autobahns formed the first limited-access, high-speed road network in the world, with the first section from Frankfurt am Main to Darmstadt opening in 1935. The first long-distance rural freeway in the United States is generally considered to be the Pennsylvania Turnpike, which opened on October 1, 1940.Phil Patton, The Open Road: A Celebration of the American Highway (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1986), 77. In the United States, the Interstate Highway System was authorised by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. Most of the system was completed between 1960 and 1990. ;The Internet Research into packet switching started in the early 1960s.

Laurent, Valencia, Ayuntamiento de Valencia, 2003. when they were a prison. Picture by Ainaud, commissioned by J. Laurent. The Serrans Gate or Serranos Gate (, ; , ), also known as Serrans Towers or Serranos Towers (, ; , ) is one of the twelve gates that formed part of the ancient city wall, the Christian Wall (Muralla cristiana), of the city of Valencia, Spain. It was built in Valencian Gothic style at the end of the 14th century (between 1392 and 1398). Its name is probably due to its location in the northeast of the old city centre, making it the entry point for the royal road (camí ral) connecting Valencia with the comarca or district of Els Serrans (along the road going northwest towards the mountains around Teruel and eventually leading to Saragossa) as well as the entry point for the royal road to Barcelona, or because the majority of settlers near there in the time of James I of Aragon were from the area around Teruel, whose inhabitants were often called serrans (mountain people) by the Valencians. Alternatively, the gate may also have been named after an important family, the Serrans, who lived in a street with the same name. It is an important landmark and one of the best preserved monuments of Valencia. Of the ancient city wall, which was pulled down in 1865 on the orders of the provincial governor Cirilio Amorós, only the Serrans Towers, the 15th century Quart Towers, and some other archaeological remains and ruins, such as those of the Jewish Gate (Puerta de los Judíos), have survived. The Torres de Serrans were built in the 14th century, 1392, by Pere Balaguer. It was the main entrance to the city and it was originally built with a defensive function. From 1586 until 1887 the towers were used as a prison for nobles.  Construction and structure  Commissioned by the Valencian government, the Serrans Towers were built by the architect Pere Balaguer, who was inspired by other Gothic gates with polygonal towers, such as the Porta de Sant Miquel in Morella and the Royal Gate (Porta Reial) of the Poblet Monastery, showing Genoese influences. Construction began on 6 April 1392, on the site of an older gateway. The walls consist of very solid stone, as their main purpose was fortification. However, they are covered with a cladding of limestone, mainly from Alginet, a town near Valencia, in order to give the building a more luxurious, distinguished appearance. In 1397, when the works were nearly finished, it became apparent that the access to the main floor had to be improved. An enormous, monumental stone staircase was built, enlarging the building and facilitating its use for welcoming parties. The works were completed in March 1398.  History and uses  For a long time, its main purpose was to defend the city in the event of a siege or attack, but it was also regularly used for ceremonies, such as official welcoming ceremonies for ambassadors and kings, as it was (and still is) deemed to be the main entrance to the city. After one of the main prisons of Valencia burnt down in 1586, the towers were turned into a prison for knights and the nobility until the prisoners were transferred to the monastery of Saint Austin in 1887. Since then, they have been used for different purposes, for instance for a wide range of official ceremonies and as a museum. During the Spanish Civil War, works of art from the Prado Museum were stored in the building, which made a number of modifications necessary; in December 1936, a 90-centimeter layer of reinforced concrete was laid on the first floor in order to protect the pieces of art, stored on the lower floor, in case the towers were damaged or destroyed in a bombing raid. The reinforced concrete was covered by a one-meter layer of rice husk (to cushion the impact) and a one-meter layer of soil. Another one-meter layer of soil was laid on the second floor, and the terrace was covered with sandbags. Moreover, an automatic system of humidity and temperature control was installed. This project was directed by José Lino Vaamonde, the architect of the Artistic Treasures Board (Junta Central de Salvamento del Tesoro Artístico).  Restoration  Valencian coat of arms with the crown of the kingdom and the bat, decorating a grille of a door to the interior staircases. Like the Quart Towers (Torres de Quart), the Serranos Towers survived the demolition of the city wall due to their use as a prison, but the building, especially its internal structure, was damaged. Thus, the large arches opening out onto the internal part of the building were walled up, several windows were built into the outside walls, and the battlements crowning the towers disappeared. In 1871, the city council decided to fill in the ditch in front of the gate, which affected the appearance of the building. Between 1893 and 1914, its restoration, directed by the sculptor José Aixá, was carried out by The Royal Academy of San Carlos (Real Academia de San Carlos). In 2000, the stone surfaces were cleaned, giving the building its current appearance.  Current uses  At present, the Serranos Towers are open to the public. From the top of the building, visitors can enjoy an amazing view of the city of Valencia. They are also used for different official ceremonies of the City of Valencia, the most famous of which is the crida, the opening ceremony of the Fallas. On the last Sunday of February, the Fallera Mayor (the \\"first lady\\" of the Fallas festivities) declares the Fallas open from a platform erected in front of the building, which is followed by the singing of the anthem of the Valencian Community.

This article delineates both the fixed assets, and the control systems, software required to operate, manage and monitor the systems, as well as any accessory buildings, plants, or vehicles that are an essential part of the system. Also included are fleets of vehicles operating according to schedules such as public transit buses and garbage collection, as well as basic energy or communications facilities that are not usually part of a physical network, such as oil refineries, radio, and television broadcasting facilities.  Attributes  Hard infrastructure in general usually has the following attributes:  Capital assets that provide services  These are physical assets that provide services. The people employed in the hard infrastructure sector generally maintain, monitor, and operate the assets, but do not offer services to the clients or users of the infrastructure. Interactions between workers and clients are generally limited to administrative tasks concerning ordering, scheduling, or billing of services.  Large networks  These are large networks constructed over generations, and are not often replaced as a whole system. The network provides services to a geographically defined area, and has a long life because its service capacity is maintained by continual refurbishment or replacement of components as they wear out.  Historicity and interdependence  The system or network tends to evolve over time as it is continuously modified, improved, enlarged, and as various components are rebuilt, decommissioned or adapted to other uses. The system components are interdependent and not usually capable of subdivision or separate disposal, and consequently are not readily disposable within the commercial marketplace. The system interdependency may limit a component life to a lesser period than the expected life of the component itself.  Natural monopoly  The systems tend to be natural monopolies, insofar that economies of scale means that multiple agencies providing a service are less efficient than would be the case if a single agency provided the service. This is because the assets have a high initial cost and a value that is difficult to determine. Once most of the system is built, the marginal cost of servicing additional clients or users tends to be relatively inexpensive, and may be negligible if there is no need to increase the peak capacity or the geographical extent of the network. In public economics theory, infrastructure assets such as highways and railways tend to be public goods, in that they carry a high degree of non-excludability, where no household can be excluded from using it, and non-rivalry, where no household can reduce another from enjoying it. These properties lead to externality, free ridership, and spillover effects that distort perfect competition and market efficiency. Hence, government becomes the best actor to supply the public goods.Myles, G. D. (1995) Public Economics. Cambridge University Press. 263-264 pg.

It is regarded by many Catholics as a continuation or actualization of St. Augustine of Hippo’s the City of God (De Civitate Dei). It proposes, much like the City of God, a metaphysical appreciation of universal history as an actual war between God and the Devil. Spiritual warfare In this war, God moves (by divine intervention/ Divine providence) those governments, political/ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Catholic Church (the City of God) in order to oppose by all means (including military) those governments, political/ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Devil (the City of the Devil). While the City of God is always the Church and those movements or governments that support it, the City of the Devil changes significantly with the centuries. In Catholic doctrine This concept of universal history is actual part of the official doctrine of the Catholic Church as was most recently stated in the Second Vatican Council' s Gaudium et Spes document: \\"The Church ... holds that in her most benign Lord and Master can be found the key, the focal point and the goal of man, as well as of all human history...all of human life, whether individual or collective, shows itself to be a dramatic struggle between good and evil, between light and darkness...The Lord is the goal of human history the focal point of the longings of history and of civilization, the center of the human race, the joy of every heart and the answer to all its yearnings\\" (GS 10, 13, 45). Key points The Catholic Encyclopedia Thomas Oestreich (1913). Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company.depicts the key point of Speech of Universal History as follows: “…This is why the idea of Providence is at the same time the law of history. If the crash of empires \\"falling one upon another\\" does not in truth express some purpose of God regarding humanity, then history, or what is called by that name, is indeed no longer anything but a chaotic chronology, the meaning of which we should strive in vain to disentangle. In that case, fortune, or rather chance, would be the mistress of human affairs; the existence of humanity would be only a bad dream, or phantasmagoria, whose changing face would be inadequate to mask a void of nothingness. We should be fretting ourselves in that void without reason and almost without cause, our very actions would be but phantoms, and the only result of so many efforts accumulated through so many thousands of years would be the conviction, every day more clear, of their uselessness, which would be another void of nothingness. And why, after all, were there Greeks and Romans? Of what use was Salamis? Actium? Poitiers? Lepanto? Why was there a Caesar, and a Charlemagne? Let us frankly own, then, that unless something Divine circulates in history, there is no history. Nations like individuals, live only by maintaining uninterrupted communication with God, and it is precisely this condition of their existence which is called by the name of Providence. Providence is the condition or the possibility of history, as the stability of the laws of nature is the condition of the possibility of science. ..It was Providence that made of the Jewish people a people apart, a unique people, the chosen people, charged with maintaining and defending the worship of the true God throughout the pagan centuries, against the prestige of an idolatry which essentially consisted in the deification of the energies of nature. It was Providence that, by means of Roman unity and of its extension throughout the known universe, rendered not only possible but easy and almost necessary, the conversion of the world to Christianity .It was Providence, again, that developed the features of the modern world out of the disorder of barbarous invasions and reconciled the two antiquities under the law of Christ. If the action of Providence is manifest anywhere, it is in the sequence of the history of Christianity. And what is more natural under the circumstances than to make of its history the demonstration of its truth?\\" References Category:Works about history Category:French literature Category:Catholic theology and doctrine ","title":"Speech of Universal History"},{"id":"46186892","text":"Adrian \\"Ady\\" Lewis (born 31 May 1975) is a British former professional boxer who competed from 1994 to 2001.

Ownership and financing of infrastructure  Infrastructure may be owned and managed by governments or by private companies, such as sole public utility or railway companies. Generally, most roads, major ports and airports, water distribution systems and sewage networks are publicly owned, whereas most energy and telecommunications networks are privately owned. Publicly owned infrastructure may be paid for from taxes, tolls, or metered user fees, whereas private infrastructure is generally paid for by metered user fees. Major investment projects are generally financed by the issuance of long-term bonds. Hence, government owned and operated infrastructure may be developed and operated in the private sector or in public-private partnerships, in addition to in the public sector. In the United States, public spending on infrastructure has varied between 2.3% and 3.6% of GDP since 1950.\\"Money for Public Projects\\", The New York Times, November 19, 2008 Many financial institutions invest in infrastructure.  Infrastructure debt  Infrastructure debt is a complex investment category reserved for highly sophisticated institutional investors who can gauge jurisdiction-specific risk parameters, assess a project’s long-term viability, understand transaction risks, conduct due diligence, negotiate (multi)creditors’ agreements, make timely decisions on consents and waivers, and analyze loan performance over time. Research conducted by the World Pensions Council (WPC) suggests that most UK and European pensions wishing to gain a degree of exposure to infrastructure debt have done so indirectly, through investments made in infrastructure funds managed by specialised Canadian, US and Australian funds. On November 29, 2011, the British government unveiled an unprecedented plan to encourage large-scale pension investments in new roads, hospitals, airports, etc. across the UK. The plan is aimed at enticing 20 billion pounds ($30.97 billion) of investment in domestic infrastructure projects. Infrastructure as a new asset class for pension funds and SWFs Pension and sovereign wealth funds are major direct investors in infrastructure. Most pension funds have long-dated liabilities, with matching long-term investments. These large institutional investors need to protect the long-term value of their investments from inflationary debasement of currency and market fluctuations, and provide recurrent cash flows to pay for retiree benefits in the short-medium term: from that perspective, think-tanks such as the World Pensions Council (WPC) have argued that infrastructure is an ideal asset class that provides tangible advantages such as long duration (facilitating cash flow matching with long-term liabilities), protection against inflation and statistical diversification (low correlation with ‘traditional’ listed assets such as equity and fixed income investments), thus reducing overall portfolio volatility. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the investment of institutional investors in developing countries' infrastructure markets, it is necessary to design risk-allocation mechanisms more carefully, given the higher risks of developing countries' markets.Koh, Jae Myong (2018) Green Infrastructure Financing: Institutional Investors, PPPs and Bankable Projects, Palgrave Macmillan. Supranational and public co-investment with institutional asset owners The notion of supranational and public co-investment in infrastructure projects jointly with private institutional asset owners has gained traction amongst IMF, World Bank and European Commission policy makers in recent years notably in the last months of 2014/early 2015: Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group (October 2014) and adoption of the €315 bn European Commission Investment Plan for Europe (December 2014).M. Nicolas J. Firzli : ‘2014 LTI Rome Conference: Infrastructure-Driven Development to Conjure Away the EU Malaise?’, Revue Analyse Financière, Q1 2015 – Issue N°54  Foreign ownership of 'public assets'  Some experts have warned against the risk of \\"infrastructure nationalism\\", insisting that steady investment flows from foreign pension and sovereign funds were key for the long-term success of the asset class- notably in large European jurisdictions such as France and the UK  Comparison of private versus public investment  An interesting comparison between privatisation versus government-sponsored public works involves high-speed rail (HSR) projects in East Asia. In 1998, the Taiwan government awarded the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation, a private organisation, to construct the 345 km line from Taipei to Kaohsiung in a 35-year concession contract. Conversely, in 2004 the South Korean government charged the Korean High Speed Rail Construction Authority, a public entity, to construct its high-speed rail line, 412 km from Seoul to Busan, in two phases. While different implementation strategies, Taiwan successfully delivered the HSR project in terms of project management (time, cost, and quality), whereas South Korea successfully delivered its HSR project in terms of product success (meeting owners' and users' needs, particularly in ridership). Additionally, South Korea successfully created a technology transfer of high-speed rail technology from French engineers, essentially creating an industry of HSR manufacturing capable of exporting knowledge, equipment, and parts worldwide.Kao, T., Yung-Cheng, L, and Shih, M. (2010). Privatization Versus Public Works for High Speed Rail Projects. Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board. Issue: 2159. Pp. 18-26.  Planning and management of infrastructure   Infrastructure asset management  The method of infrastructure asset management is based upon the definition of a Standard of service (SoS) that describes how an asset will perform in objective and measurable terms. The SoS includes the definition of a minimum condition grade, which is established by considering the consequences of a failure of the infrastructure asset. The key components of infrastructure asset management are: *Definition of a standard of service **Establishment of measurable specifications of how the asset should perform **Establishment of a minimum condition grade *Establishment of a whole-life cost approach to managing the asset *Elaboration of an Asset Management Plan After completing asset management, official conclusions are made. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the United States a \\"D+\\" on its 2017 infrastructure report card.  Engineering  The Berlin Brandenburg Airport under construction. Most infrastructure is designed by civil engineers or architects.Amekudzi, A. A., and S. McNeil. \\"Infrastructure reporting and asset management: Best practices and opportunities (Transportation & Development Institute (American Society of Civil Engineers). Infrastructure Systems Committee., Trans.).\\" Reston, Va.: American Society of Civil Engineers (2008). page 2 Generally road and rail transport networks, as well as water and waste management infrastructure are designed by civil engineers, electrical power and lighting networks are designed by power engineers and electrical engineers, and telecommunications, computing and monitoring networks are designed by systems engineers. In the case of urban infrastructure, the general layout of roads, sidewalks and public places may sometimes be developed at a conceptual level by urban planners or architects, although the detailed design will still be performed by civil engineers. Depending upon the height of the building, it may be designed by an architect or for tall buildings,a structural engineer, and if an industrial or processing plant is required, the structures and foundation work will still be done by civil engineers, but the process equipment and piping may be designed by industrial engineer or a process engineer. In terms of engineering tasks, the design and construction management process usually follows these steps: ;Planning and Preliminary Engineering Studies In general, infrastructure is planned by urban planners or civil engineersAmerican Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), Policy Statement 131 - Growth and Development-The Civil Engineer's role is to plan, design and implement the built environment in service to society. at a high level for transportation, water/waste water, electrical, urban zones, parks and other public and private systems. These plans typically analyze policy decisions and impacts of trade offs for alternatives. In addition, planners may lead or assist with environmental review that are commonly required to construct infrastructure. Colloquially this process is referred to as Infrastructure Planning. These activities are usually performed in preparation for preliminary engineering or conceptual design that is led by civil engineers or architects. Preliminary studies may also be performed and may include steps such as: *Determine existing and future traffic loads, determine existing capacity, and estimate the existing and future standards of service *Conduct a preliminary survey and obtain information from existing air photos, maps, and plans *Identify possible conflicts with other assets or topographical features *Perform environmental impact studies: **Evaluate the impact on the human environment (noise pollution, odors, electromagnetic interference, etc.) **Evaluate the impact on the natural environment (disturbance of natural ecosystems) **Evaluate the possible presence of contaminated soils; **Given various time horizons, standards of service, environmental impacts, and conflicts with existing structures or terrain, propose various preliminary designs **Estimate the costs of the various designs, and make recommendations ;Detailed Survey *Perform a detailed survey of the construction site *Obtain \\"as built\\" drawings of existing infrastructure *Dig exploratory pits where required to survey underground infrastructure *Perform a geotechnical survey to determine the bearing capacity of soils and rock *Perform soil sampling and testing to estimate nature, degree and extent of soil contamination ;Detailed Engineering *Prepare detailed plans and technical specifications *Prepare a detailed bill of materials *Prepare a detailed cost estimate *Establish a general work schedule ;Authorisation *Obtain authorisation from environmental and other regulatory agencies *Obtain authorisation from any owners or operators of assets affected by the work *Inform emergency services, and prepare contingency plans in case of emergencies ;Tendering *Prepare administrative clauses and other tendering documents *Organise and announce a call for tenders *Answer contractor questions and issue addenda during the tendering process *Receive and analyse tenders, and make a recommendation to the owner ;Construction Supervision *Once the construction contract has been signed between the owner and the general contractor, all authorisations have been obtained, and all pre- construction submittals have been received from the general contractor, the construction supervisor issues an \\"Order to begin construction\\" *Regularly schedule meetings and obtain contact information for the general contractor (GC) and all interested parties *Obtain a detailed work schedule and list of subcontractors from the GC *Obtain detailed traffic diversion and emergency plans from the GC *Obtain proof of certification, insurance and bonds *Examine shop drawings submitted by the GC *Receive reports from the materials quality control lab *When required, review Change requests from the GC, and issue construction directives and change orders *Follow work progress and authorise partial payments *When substantially completed, inspect the work and prepare a list of deficiencies *Supervise testing and commissioning *Verify that all operating and maintenance manuals, as well as warranties, are complete *Prepare \\"as built\\" drawings *Make a final inspection, issue a certificate of final completion, and authorise the final payment File:BBI 2010-07-23 5.JPGthumbrightThe Berlin Brandenburg Airport under construction.  Economic, social and environmental impacts of infrastructure   Impact on economic development  Investment in infrastructure is part of the capital accumulation required for economic development and may affect socioeconomic measures of welfare.Luis Flores Ballesteros. \\"How Lack and Poor Infrastructure Shapes Inequality and Poverty\\" 54 Pesos Sep. 2010:54 Pesos 9 September 2010 The causality of infrastructure and economic growth has always been in debate. Generally, infrastructure plays a critical role in expanding national production capacity, which leads to increase in a country's wealth.Koh, Jae Myong (2018) Green Infrastructure Financing: Institutional Investors, PPPs and Bankable Projects, Palgrave Macmillan, pp.12-51. In developing nations, expansions in electric grids, roadways, and railways show marked growth in economic development. However, the relationship does not remain in advanced nations who witness more and more lower rates of return on such infrastructure investments. Nevertheless, infrastructure yields indirect benefits through the supply chain, land values, small business growth, consumer sales, and social benefits of community development and access to opportunity. The American Society of Civil Engineers cite the many transformative projects that have shaped the growth of the United States including the Transcontinental Railroad that connected major cities from the Atlantic to Pacific coast; the Panama Canal that revolutionised shipment in connected the two oceans in the Western hemisphere; the Interstate Highway System that spawned the mobility of the masses; and still others that include the Hoover Dam, Trans-Alaskan pipeline, and many bridges (the Golden Gate, Brooklyn, and San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge).Griggs, F. E. (2003). Perspectives in Civil Engineering. 1852-2002: 150 Years in Civil Engineering in the United States. American Society of Civil Engineers. Edited by Jeffrey S. Russell. Pp. 111-122. All these efforts are testimony to the infrastructure and economic development correlation. European and Asian development economists have also argued that the existence of modern rail infrastructure is a significant indicator of a country’s economic advancement: this perspective is illustrated notably through the Basic Rail Transportation Infrastructure Index (known as BRTI Index)  Use as economic stimulus  During the Great Depression of the 1930s, many governments undertook public works projects in order to create jobs and stimulate the economy. The economist John Maynard Keynes provided a theoretical justification for this policy in The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money,Keynes, John Maynard (2007) [1936]. The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. Basingstoke, Hampshire: Palgrave Macmillan. . published in 1936. Following the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, some again proposed investing in infrastructure as a means of stimulating the economy (see the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009).  Environmental impacts  While infrastructure development may initially be damaging to the natural environment, justifying the need to assess environmental impacts, it may contribute in mitigating the \\"perfect storm\\" of environmental and energy sustainability, particularly in the role transportation plays in modern society.Puentes, R. (2008). A Bridge to Somewhere: Rethinking American Transportation for the 21st Century. Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Report: Blueprint for American Prosperity series report. Offshore wind power in England and Denmark may cause issues to local ecosystems but are incubators to clean energy technology for the surrounding regions. Ethanol production may overuse available farmland in Brazil but have propelled the country to energy independence. High-speed rail may cause noise and wide swathes of rights-of-way through countrysides and urban communities but have helped China, Spain, France, Germany, Japan, and other nations deal with concurrent issues of economic competitiveness, climate change, energy use, and built environment sustainability.

Today, it is an Ortsteil of the Gemeinde Sylt. Etymology Archsum (North Frisian: Arichsem) derives from \\"settlement of Arke\\" or \\"settlement of Erke\\". History Based on burial sites found in the 1930s, the area was settled as early as the Neolithic. Arxsum was first mentioned in 1462. In 1611, there were 38 farms and the population totalled around 150. In 1709, 25 men out of 53 families were seafarers. Whaling helped to boost the number of inhabitants to 259 by 1745 (40 mariners). Many ship masters built houses in Archsum after retiring. By 1850, the number of farms had fallen back to 45. By 1952, the population had declined to just 129. Only during the 1930s, when Sylt was fortified by the military, did the number of inhabitants rise briefly (1939: 306, half of which belonged to the Reichsarbeitsdienst). Until the Nössedeich was constructed in 1936/37, the area was liable to flooding which destroyed both harvests and homes. Geography Archsum is located roughly 6 kilometres southeast of Westerland, between Keitum and Morsum. The village territory covers 679 hectares. Demographics Archsum has a population of around 240 (2013). Economy Agriculture and seafaring were long the mainstays of the Archsum economy. Since 1961, Archsum has held the status of Luftkurort (climatic spa). Today, tourism dominates the local economy. Attractions Local Neolithic sites include the Merelmerskhoog, a 4,500-year-old passage grave. Raised areas that served as dwelling sites such as the Firstklent, were excavated in 1969-73 by Joachim Reinstein, yielding findings from the Stone and Bronze Age. Dwellings were discovered that pointed to a 2,000-year-old village, and another settlement likely in use between 700 and 1000 AD. The last visible remains of the so-called Archsumburg (a circular rampart with an internal diameter of roughly 65 metres, built around 2,000 years ago) were probably removed around 1860. Government In the Gebietsreform of 1970, Archsum became part of Sylt-Ost. Sylt-Ost was merged on 1 January 2009 with Rantum and the town of Westerland. In separate referendums in 2008, Westerland (by a large majority) and Sylt-Ost (narrowly) agreed to the merger in May 2008. Rantum followed. In September 2008, the merger contract was signed. Archsum is now an Ortsteil of Gemeinde Sylt. Since 1 May 2015, the mayor of Gemeinde Sylt has been Nikolas Häckel. Infrastructure Transport The K117 road connects Archsum to Morsum as well as to Keitum and Westerland. ' operates buses that provide public transport on the island.

Etymology Morsum (North Frisian: Muasem) derives from \\"settlement of Mar\\". History Morsum was first mentioned in a document of 1462 (Zinsbuch of the Bistum Schleswig). Until the 19th century, it was the most populous village on Sylt. In 1695, Morsum had 118 taxable dwellings. A school house was built in 1705. In 1927, Morsum was connected to the railway on the Niebüll-Westerland line. Geography Morsum is a ' located on the Wadden Sea side of the island of Sylt. Morsum is the easternmost village on Sylt and consists of the sub-villages Abort (North Frisian: Abuurt), Groß- Morsum (North Frisian: Gurtmuasem, Danish: Store Morsum), Klein-Morsum (North Frisian: Litjmuasem, Danish: Lille Morsum), Holm (North Frisian: Holerem, Danish: Holmen), Klampshörn (North Frisian: Klaampshörn), Nösse (North Frisian: Nösi, Danish: Næsodde), Osterende (North Frisian: Uasterjen, Danish: Østerende), Schellinghörn (North Frisian: Skelinghör, Danish: Skellinghjørne ) and Wall (North Frisian: Val, Danish: Vold). The total area is around 1,164 hectares. Morsum is located at the transition between higher lying geest and the low-lying marshes that, until the Nössedeich was constructed in 1936/37, were constantly threatened with flooding. Northeast of the village lies the ' (see below). Demographics Morsum has around 1,160 inhabitants (2013). The use of the local dialect, Söl'ring is still more prevalent in Morsum than in other parts of the island. Economy Agriculture has always been more important in Morsum than in the other villages on Sylt. Today, like elsewhere on Sylt, tourism is the dominant industry. Since 1958, Morsum has held the status of Luftkurort (climatic spa). There are many traditional Uthland- Frisian houses and a number of craftspeople and galleries have established themselves in the village. Attractions St. Martin St. Martin The Romanesque church is located a bit outside of the village centre on a slight elevation in the marshes. It was built in the early 13th century and thus, with St. Severin at Keitum, is one of the oldest surviving church buildings on Sylt. During the Thirty Years War, the church was turned into a fortified church. St. Martin has no steeple or tower. The wooden bell tower is separate from the church building itself, sitting in the grave yard. St. Martin features a 13th-century baptismal font and a 17th-century oaken pulpit. Today, St. Martin is a Protestant church. Morsum-Kliff Morsum-Kliff Morsum- Kliff Morsum-Kliff has been described as \\"one of the most important geological monuments in Germany\\". It stretches for around 1.8 kilometres along the northeastern coast and rises to a height of up to 21 metres. The Kliff is made up of various layers of soil: * gray-black Glimmerton dating back 5 to 7 million years and including fossils such as snails, mussels and crabs * reddish Limonite dating back 4 to 5 million years * white Kaolin sands deposited here 2 to 3 million years ago from Scandinavia and containing fossilised corals, sea lilies and sponges (dead for around 500 million years). These three layers were originally on top of each other but about 15,000 years ago during the ice age they were compressed and folded by glacial activity, so that in places they are now horizontally next to each other. The Kliff and the nearby heath-covered area (around 43 hectares) have been a nature preserve since 1923. This prevented the planned use of the sand deposits in construction of the Hindenburgdamm. In 2006, the Kliff was declared a ' (national geotope). In the past there have been several attempts to mine the cliff. In the 1870s, Ludwig Meyn bought local properties to operate an iron mine here. He planned to use the mining waste in the construction of a causeway to the mainland. However, the soil did not contain sufficient iron ore for the scheme to be implemented. In the 1930s, the Nazi government took an interest in the local iron ore deposits, but by the beginning of World War II no thorough prospection and evaluation had taken place. Another attempt was undertaken during the 1950s, when businesses were looking for a supply of rare ores such as titanium for the resurgent German economy. Currently, the Kliff is threatened by erosion made worse by visitors or fossil hunters leaving the designated paths. Further attractions The area around Morsum features a large number of and other sites. In addition, the only extant burial mound on Sylt dating from the Viking Age is located on Morsum's territory. These monuments make up the \\"largest burial mound site in Germany\\" and include the Bronze Age burial mounds known as Munkhoog and Markmannhoog. Government In the Gebietsreform of 1970, Morsum became part of Sylt-Ost. Prior to that, the sub-villages had been Ortsteile of the municipality Morsum. Sylt-Ost was merged on 1 January 2009 with Rantum and the town of Westerland. In separate referendums in 2008, Westerland (by a large majority) and Sylt-Ost (narrowly) agreed to the merger in May 2008. Rantum followed. In September 2008, the merger contract was signed. Morsum is now an Ortsteil of Gemeinde Sylt. Since 1 May 2015, the mayor of Gemeinde Sylt has been Nikolas Häckel. Infrastructure Transport Morsum station Morsum has a railway station on the line between Westerland and Niebüll. However, long-distance trains and the Sylt Shuttle do not stop there. However, local services by Nord-Ostsee- Bahn stop at Morsum station. So there are direct connections to Hamburg- Altona, Husum or Niebüll for example. Morsum is where the Hindenburgdamm and its railway line connects the island of Sylt with the mainland. The K117 road connects Morsum to Keitum and Westerland.

History Munkmarsch mill circa 1895 The village is located on territory that once belonged to the monastery of St. Canute's Abbey, Odense. In 1573, the area was known as Sankt Knutsmarsch. A 1648 map referred to Munckmarsch, a map from 1778 used Monckmarsch. In 1744, a mill was constructed, flour produced there was mainly sent to Norway. From 1755, mail boats touched at the local harbour. The port was the main connection between Sylt and the mainland after Keitum harbour silted up in the 1850s. In 1859, a 100-metre pier for ferry ships was constructed. Paddlesteamers docked there and the passengers then took coaches to Westerland. In 1869, an inn was built, this later became the Fährhaus which still exists today. A shipyard was also constructed. In 1888, Munkmarsch was linked to Westerland by the , reducing the travel time to 12 minutes. Munkmarsch retained some of its importance until construction of the Hindenburgdamm in 1927, although after 1901 ferry traffic increasingly shifted to Hörnum.

Today, it is an Ortsteil of the Gemeinde Sylt. Etymology The meaning of Tinnum (North Frisian: Tinem) is unclear. It may derive from teninge, an Old Frisian word for \\"enclosure\\". Alternatively, it may mean \\"home of Tinne\\". History In the marshes southwest of the village lies the so-called Tinnumburg, a circular rampart on a site that shows sign of human use going back 2,000 years. Local tradition holds that Thing meetings used to be held near burial mounds to the north of the village (now removed to make way for the airport). Tynnum was first mentioned in a document in 1462. In 1613, there were 34 land owners. In 1649, the Landvogtei was constructed - the seat of the Vogt, the local representative of the liege lord. Tinnum remained the seat of the Vogt of Sylt until 1868. The first (private) school was built in Tinnum in 1659. In 1665, there were 55 taxable homes, including a newly constructed mill. In 1770, there were 88 houses, but that number was reduced by the great flood of 1825 to 72 (252 inhabitants). In 1837, the prison for Sylt was built here and Tinnum became the seat of the Amtsgericht (local court), until it was moved to Westerland in 1904. In 1838, a school of navigation moved to Tinnum. By 1890, there were 72 houses with 347 inhabitants. Tinnum was connected to the Westerland electricity grid in 1925. In the 1920s, Tinnum was the source of much of the earth used in construction of the Hindenburgdamm. From 1927 until 1930, Tinnum had a station on the newly built Westerland-Niebüll railway line. Tinnum's vicinity to Westerland and its central location near the railway line resulted in industrial estates and warehouses being constructed in the village, changing its rural appearance, especially following World War II. Geography The centre of Tinnum is located circa 4 kilometres southeast of the centre of Westerland. The total area of the Ortsteil is around 751 hectares. Demographics Tinnum has a population of around 3,100 (2013). Economy Today, tourism dominates the local economy. The business park areas along the K117 road play an important role in servicing both the tourism industry and the general Sylt economy. There are also several large scale retail businesses. A dairy closed in 1996. Since 1960, Tinnum has held the status of Luftkurort (climatic spa). Attractions Tinnumburg Tinnumburg The site today called ' has yielded findings dating back around 2,000 years. It likely served as a pagan cult site at that point. After a lapse of several hundred years, the currently visible earthen ramparts (remaining height up to 8 metres, depth up to 20 metres, diameter 120 metres) were built. During the Viking Age, the structure was used to protect dwellings. A 1976 excavation found the remains of prehistoric hearth sites and earthen huts. In the 18th century, a Landvogt had the site \\"excavated\\" and one of the walls pierced. In the 19th century, farmers used the site as a watering place for cattle. Trenches dug during World War II were later filled in. Others A small zoo has been in operation since 1963, showing around 300 species.

It was premiered by Rudolf Baumgartner with the festival's Lucerne Festival Strings. It was published shortly after by Éditions Salabert.  Structure  The piece is in only one movement and takes around 12 minutes to perform. It is scored for four first violins, three second violins, two violas, two cellos and one double bass, even though it is clarified by Xenakis that it can also be performed by a larger string orchestra or ensemble. Aroura makes an extensive use of glissandos, jagged chords, sound clusters and other techniques exploited in avant-garde movements. The piece has a tempo of 𝅗𝅥 = 60 (which means two beats per second). The register of the piece ranges from a C1 (played by the double bass) to D8, played by one of the first violins. First and second violins rarely play unison, but each of the violinist has their own line. Xenakis uses graphic notation up to six times in the score, the first one being the opening of the composition.

With Marlene Mattos's general directorate, five blocks and an hour long, the new program of the host brought jokes and scoundrels, gathering parents and children, presenting musical numbers and showing a table of interviews. Concept Aimed at the whole family, initially the program would be monthly due to the accumulation of professional commitments in the agenda of Xuxa Meneghel. The attraction bearing the host's name was displayed on Sundays before Domingão do Faustão. Among the prominent figures were X of the Problem, which addressed topics related to adolescents and involved expert advice, and Pyramid, in which famous adults paired with children in the auditorium to guess words. With each hit, the pair advanced a little to the top and thus win the prize - a sum of money. Every week the program gained new cadres. The Mela-Mela, in which the child received a surprise bath and had to guess what had fallen on his head (water, paint, honey or flower petals), was considered one of the most fun of the program. Another table in which the participant was smeared from head to foot, Stepping on the Tomato, also amused the audience: the child had to guess, blindfolded, on what was walking. All the jokes gave cash prizes. Xuxa made room for anonymous people through the Minute of Fame, in which anyone could be interviewed by the host. The program launched the \\"An Idea to Heal the World\\" promotion: children ages 5 to 10 could participate by sending phrases and drawings to production. The winner received as a prize a week in Los Angeles with escort, and a visit to the ranch of singer Michael Jackson. Scenery The scenery of Xuxa resembled a street, with an iron bridge in the background and the stylized silhouette of a city. People could walk on the bridge, pacing the stage. Some of the scenographic constructions served for Xuxa to play. On the stage there was also a stage, with a transparent panoramic elevator in the center, used by the queen of the little ones to make their entry into the program.

The history of urban planning runs parallel to the history of the city, as planning is in evidence at some of the earliest known urban sites.  Pre-classical  The pre-Classical and Classical periods saw a number of cities laid out according to fixed plans, though many tended to develop organically. Designed cities were characteristic of the Minoan, Mesopotamian, Harrapan, and Egyptian civilisations of the third millennium BC (see Urban planning in ancient Egypt). The first recorded description of urban planning appears in the Epic of Gilgamesh: \\"Go up on to the wall of Uruk and walk around. Inspect the foundation platform and scrutinise the brickwork. Testify that its bricks are baked bricks, And that the Seven Counsellors must have laid its foundations. One square mile is city, one square mile is orchards, one square mile is claypits, as well as the open ground of Ishtar's temple.Three square miles and the open ground comprise Uruk. Look for the copper tablet-box, Undo its bronze lock, Open the door to its secret, Lift out the lapis lazuli tablet and read.\\" Dalley 1989, p.120. Distinct characteristics of urban planning from remains of the cities of Harappa, Lothal, Dholavira, and Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley Civilisation (in modern-day northwestern India and Pakistan) lead archeologists to interpret them as the earliest known examples of deliberately planned and managed cities.Davreu, Robert (1978). \\"Cities of Mystery: The Lost Empire of the Indus Valley\\". The World’s Last Mysteries. (second edition). Sydney: Readers’ Digest. pp. 121-129. .Kipfer, Barbara Ann (2000). Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology. (Illustrated edition). New York: Springer. p. 229. . The streets of many of these early cities were paved and laid out at right angles in a grid pattern, with a hierarchy of streets from major boulevards to residential alleys. Archaeological evidence suggests that many Harrapan houses were laid out to protect from noise and to enhance residential privacy; many also had their own water wells, probably both for sanitary and for ritual purposes. These ancient cities were unique in that they often had drainage systems, seemingly tied to a well-developed ideal of urban sanitation. Cities laid out on the grid plan could have been an outgrowth of agriculture based on rectangular fields.Eran Ben-Joseph, \\"Codes and Standards\\"; in Weber & Crane (2012), p. 357: \\"Other excavations, such as those in the Indus Valley, at Mohenjo-Daro and at Harappa in Punjam, show that the valley had cities planned and built in rectangular blocks lined with two- story houses along broad, straight streets. Such evidence of the pervasive use of orthogonal arrangements tells of an enduring continuity of farm, village, and city. The farmer's custom of long narrow fields and right-angled boundaries carried easily to streets and squares. However, the innovative geometry of towns and cities was influenced more by the mechanics of supplying water and draining sewage than in the imposition of right-angled street corners.\\" Many Central American civilisations also planned their cities, including sewage systems and running water. In Mexico, Tenochtitlan, built on an island in Lake Texcoco in the present-day Mexico City in central Mexico, served as the capital of the Aztec empire. At its height, Tenochtitlan was one of the largest cities in the world, with over 200,000 inhabitants.  China  China has a tradition of urban planning dating back thousands of years.  Greco-Roman empires  Map of Pella, showing the grid plan of the city Traditionally, the Greek philosopher Hippodamus (5th century BC) is regarded as the first town planner and ‘inventor’ of the orthogonal urban layout. Aristotle called him \\"the father of city planning\\",Aristotle, Politica II and until well into the 20th century, he was indeed regarded as such. This is, however, only partly justified. The Hippodamian plan that was called after him, is an orthogonal urban layout with more or less square street blocks. Archaeological finds from ancient Egypt—among others—demonstrate that Hippodamus cannot truly have been the inventor of this layout.Urban planning in ancient Egypt Aristotle's critique and indeed ridicule of Hippodamus, which appears in Politics 2. 8, is perhaps the first known example of a criticism of urban planning. From about the late 8th century on, Greek city-states started to found colonies along the coasts of the Mediterranean, which were centred on newly created towns and cities with more or less regular orthogonal plans. Gradually, the new layouts became more regular.Kolb, Frank (1984). Die Stadt im Altertum. München: Verlag C.H. Beck. pp. 51-141: Morris, A.E.J. (1972). History of Urban Form. Prehistory to the Renaissance. London. pp. 22-23. After the city of Miletus was destroyed by the Persians in 494 BC, it was rebuilt in a regular form that, according to tradition, was determined by the ideas of Hippodamus of Miletus.Hippodamus is also reported to have played an important role in the (re-)planning of the city of Piraeus, and he is also associated to Thurii and Rhodes. It seems that the importance of Hippodamus’ ideas was not so much in the orthogonal plan, but rather in the distribution of functions and social classes across the city. (Kolb 1984, pp. 115-120; Cahill, Nicholas (2002). Household and City Organization at Olynthus. New Haven. par. 1.2) Regular orthogonal plans particularly appear to have been laid out for new colonial cities and cities that were rebuilt in a short period of time after destruction. Following in the tradition of Hippodamus about a century later, Alexander commissioned the architect Dinocrates to lay out his new city of Alexandria, the grandest example of idealised urban planning of the ancient Hellenistic world, where the city's regularity was facilitated by its level site near a mouth of the Nile. The ancient Romans also employed regular orthogonal structures on which they molded their colonies.Morris 1972, pp. 39-41, 51-60; Kolb 1984, pp. 169-238; Benevolo, Leonardo (1993). Die Geschichte der Stadt. Frankfurt am Main/New York. pp. 256-267. They probably were inspired by Greek and Hellenic examples, as well as by regularly planned cities that were built by the Etruscans in Italy.Harris, W. (1989). \\"Invisible Cities: the Beginning of Etruscan Urbanization\\". Atti del Secondo Congresso Internazionale Etrusco. Roma, 1989. pp. 375-392. p. 85. The Etruscans were, in their turn, probably also influenced in this respect by Greek and Hellenic culture. (See Marzabotto.) The Roman engineer Vitruvius established principles of good design whose influence is still felt today.Jerke, Porter & Lassar (2008), pp. 8–9: \\"In his [Mark Salette of Gehry Partners] view, the core qualities of good design—loosely based on principles laid down by Vitruvius in the first century B.C. and countless reconceptualizations since—generally are functionality and durability, contextual compatibility, and enduring respect and value.\\" The Romans used a consolidated scheme for city planning, developed for civil convenience. The basic plan consisted of a central forum with city services, surrounded by a compact, rectilinear grid of streets. A river sometimes flowed near or through the city, providing water, transport, and sewage disposal. Hundreds of towns and cities were built by the Romans throughout their empire. Many European towns, such as Turin, preserve the remains of these schemes, which show the very logical way the Romans designed their cities. They would lay out the streets at right angles, in the form of a square grid. All roads were equal in width and length, except for two, which were slightly wider than the others. The decumanus, running east–west, and the cardo, running north–south, intersected in the middle to form the centre of the grid. All roads were made of carefully fitted flag stones and filled in with smaller, hard-packed rocks and pebbles. Bridges were constructed where needed. Each square marked by four roads was called an insula, the Roman equivalent of a modern city block. Each insula was about square. As the city developed, it could eventually be filled with buildings of various shapes and sizes and criss-crossed with back roads and alleys. The city may have been surrounded by a wall to protect it from invaders and to mark the city limits. Areas outside city limits were left open as farmland. At the end of each main road was a large gateway with watchtowers. A portcullis covered the opening when the city was under siege, and additional watchtowers were constructed along the city walls. An aqueduct was built outside the city walls. The development of Greek and Roman urbanisation is relatively well-known, as there are relatively many written sources, and there has been much attention to the subject since the Romans and Greeks are generally regarded as the main ancestors of modern Western culture. It should not be forgotten, though, that there were also other cultures with more or less urban settlements in Europe, primarily of Celtic origin.Demandt, Alexander (1998) ‘’Die Kelten’’. München: Verlag Ch. Beck. In fact, many sites where the Romans created towns, such as Paris, Vienna and Bratislava, had previously been Celtic settlements of more or less urban character. Among these, there are also cases that appear to have been newly planned, such as the Lusatian town of Biskupin in Poland.  Medieval Europe  Plan of Elburg in The Netherlands, based on the cadastral plan of 1830. Elburg was founded in 1392 by Arent toe Boecop, steward of the duke of Gelre. Arent seems to have acted as a private entrepreneur. He had bought a piece of land next to the existing town, and he obtained permission from his lord to extend and rebuild the town, and to resettle the population of the surrounding area, selling the house lots to the settlers. The highly symmetrical layout is centred on a canalised river and an intersecting street. The symmetry is disturbed, however, by the church in the eastern corner and by the pre-existing street (the only curved one in the whole town) on the northwest side. The corner bastions and the wide outer ditch were added in the late 16th century. After the gradual disintegration and fall of the West-Roman empire in the 5th century and the devastation by the invasions of Huns, Germanic peoples, Byzantines, Moors, Magyars, and Normans in the next five centuries, little remained of urban culture in western and central Europe. In the 10th and 11th centuries, though, there appears to have been a general improvement in the political stability and economy. This made it possible for trade and craft to grow and for the monetary economy and urban culture to revive. Initially, urban culture recovered particularly in existing settlements, often in remnants of Roman towns and cities, but later on, ever more towns were created anew. Meanwhile, the population of western Europe increased rapidly and the utilised agricultural area grew with it. The agricultural areas of existing villages were extended and new villages and towns were created in uncultivated areas as cores for new reclamations.Bartlett, Robert (1993) ‘’The Making of Europe. Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350’’. London/New York. pp. 5-60, 106-197; Gutkind, A.E. (1964) ‘’International History of City Development. Vol.I: Urban Development in Central-Europe’’. New York / London. pp. 13-20, 63. Urban development in the early Middle Ages, characteristically focused on a fortress, a fortified abbey, or a (sometimes abandoned) Roman nucleus, occurred \\"like the annular rings of a tree\\",Siegfried Giedion, Space, Time and Architecture (1941) 1962, in reference to an air view (fig.8) of the medieval Italian town of Bagnocavallo. Giedion's source was Luigi Piccinati, \\"Urbanistica Medioevale\\" in Urbanistica deal Antichità ad Oggi (Florence 1943). whether in an extended village or the centre of a larger city. Since the new centre was often on high, defensible ground, the city plan took on an organic character, following the irregularities of elevation contours like the shapes that result from agricultural terracing. Caernarvon (Wales). Plan by John Speed, 1611. Caernarfon castle and town were re-founded by King Edward I of England in July 1283, during his second Welsh campaign to end the Second War of Independence. In the 9th to 14th centuries, many hundreds of new towns were built in Europe, and many others were enlarged with newly planned extensions. These new towns and town extensions have played a very important role in the shaping of Europe's geographical structures as they in modern times. New towns were founded in different parts of Europe from about the 9th century on, but most of them were realised from the 12th to 14th centuries, with a peak-period at the end of the 13th. All kinds of landlords, from the highest to the lowest rank, tried to found new towns on their estates, in order to gain economical, political or military power. The settlers of the new towns generally were attracted by fiscal, economic, and juridical advantages granted by the founding lord, or were forced to move from elsewhere from his estates. Most of the new towns were to remain rather small (as for instance the bastides of southwestern France), but some of them became important cities, such as Cardiff, Leeds, ‘s-Hertogenbosch, Montauban, Bilbao, Malmö, Lübeck, Munich, Berlin, Bern, Klagenfurt, Alessandria, Warsaw and Sarajevo.Boerefijn, Wim (2010) ‘’The foundation, planning and building of new towns in the 13th and 14th centuries in Europe. An architectural-historical research into urban form and its creation’’. Phd. thesis Universiteit van Amsterdam. (). From the evidence of the preserved towns, it appears that the formal structure of many of these towns was willfully planned. The newly founded towns often show a marked regularity in their plan form, in the sense that the streets are often straight and laid out at right angles to one another, and that the house lots are rectangular, and originally largely of the same size.Beresford, Maurice (1967) ‘’New Towns of the Middle Ages. Town Plantation in England, Wales and Gascony’’. London ; Gutkind, E.A. (1972) ‘’International History of City Development. Vol.VII: Urban Development in East-Central Europe: Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary’’. New York/Londen ; Lavedan, Pierre & Jeanne Hugueney (1974) ‘’L'Urbanisme au Moyen Age’’.

Toulouse ; Guidoni, Enrico (1992) ‘’Storia dell’urbanistica. Il Duecento’’. Roma/Bari. One very clear and relatively extreme example is Elburg in the Netherlands, dating from the end of the 14th century. (see illustration) Looking at town plans such as the one of Elburg, it clearly appears that it is impossible to maintain that the straight street and the symmetrical, orthogonal town plan were new inventions from ‘the Renaissance,' and, therefore, typical of ‘modern times.' The deep depression around the middle of the 14th century marked the end of the period of great urban expansion. Only in the parts of Europe where the process of urbanisation had started relatively late, as in eastern Europe, was it still to go on for one or two more centuries. It would not be until the Industrial Revolution that the same level of expansion of urban population would be reached again, although the number of newly created settlements would remain much lower than in the 12th and 13th centuries.  Renaissance Europe (1300-1600)  Florence was an early model of the new urban planning, which took on a star-shaped layout adapted from the new star fort, designed to resist cannon fire. This model was widely imitated, reflecting the enormous cultural power of Florence in this age; \\"[t]he Renaissance was hypnotised by one city type which for a century and a half – from Filarete to Scamozzi – was impressed upon utopian schemes: this is the star-shaped city\\".Siegfried Giedion, Space, Time and Architecture (1941) 1962 p 43. Radial streets extend outward from a defined centre of military, communal or spiritual power. The Ideal City (probably by Fra Carnevale, c. 1480–1484) exemplifies Renaissance ideals of urban planning. The Roman archway and colosseum suggest the value of military victory and mass entertainment. The ideal centrally planned urban space: Sposalizio by Raphael Sanzio, 1504 Only in ideal cities did a centrally planned structure stand at the heart, as in Raphael's Sposalizio (Illustration) of 1504. As built, the unique example of a rationally planned quattrocento new city centre, that of Vigevano (1493–95), resembles a closed space instead, surrounded by arcading. Filarete's ideal city, building on Leon Battista Alberti's De re aedificatoria, was named \\"Sforzinda\\" in compliment to his patron; its twelve-pointed shape, circumscribable by a \\"perfect\\" Pythagorean figure, the circle, took no heed of its undulating terrain in Filarete's manuscript.The undulating terrace of housing makes its appearance surprisingly late: Giedion's example is Lansdown Crescent, Bath, 1794; Giedion 1962, fig. 83. This process occurred in cities, but ordinarily not in the industrial suburbs characteristic of this era (see Braudel, The Structures of Everyday Life), which remained disorderly and characterised by crowding and organic growth. Following the 1695 bombardment of Brussels by the French troops of King Louis XIV, in which a large part of the city centre was destroyed, Governor Max Emanuel proposed using the reconstruction to completely change the layout and architectural style of the city. His plan was to transform the medieval city into a city of the new Baroque style, modeled on Turin, with a logical street layout, with straight avenues offering long, uninterrupted views flanked by buildings of a uniform size. This plan was opposed by residents and municipal authorities, who wanted a rapid reconstruction, did not have the resources for grandiose proposals, and resented what they considered the imposition of a new, foreign, architectural style. In the actual reconstruction, the general layout of the city was conserved, but it was not identical to that before the cataclysm. Despite the necessity of rapid reconstruction and the lack of financial means, authorities did take several measures to improve traffic flow, sanitation, and the aesthetics of the city. Many streets were made as wide as possible to improve traffic flow.  Enlightenment Europe and America  During the Second French Empire, Haussmann transformed the medieval city of Paris into a modern capital, with long, straight, wide boulevards. The planning was influenced by many factors, not the least of which was the city's history of street revolutions. Illustration of Savannah, Georgia on the Oglethorpe Plan in 1734. During this period, rulers often embarked on ambitious attempts at redesigning their capital cities as a showpiece for the grandeur of the nation. Disasters were often a major catalyst for planned reconstruction. An exception to this was in London after the Great Fire of 1666 when, despite many radical rebuilding schemes from architects such as John Evelyn and Christopher Wren, no large-scale redesigning was achieved due to the complexities of rival ownership claims. However, improvements were made in hygiene and fire safety with wider streets, stone construction and access to the river. The Great Fire did, however, stimulate thinking about urban design that influenced city planning in North America. The Grand Model for the Province of Carolina, developed in the aftermath of the Great Fire, established a template for colonial planning. The famous Oglethorpe Plan for Savannah (1733) was in part influenced by the Grand Model. seismically protective wooden structure, the \\"gaiola pombalina\\" (pombaline cage), developed for the reconstruction of Pombaline Lower Town In contrast, after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, King Joseph I of Portugal and his ministers immediately launched efforts to rebuild the city. The architect Manuel da Maia boldly proposed razing entire sections of the city and \\"laying out new streets without restraint\\". This last option was chosen by the king and his minister.Shrady, The Last Day pp. 152–155. Keen to have a new and perfectly ordered city, the king commissioned the construction of big squares, rectilinear, large avenues and widened streets – the new mottos of Lisbon. The Pombaline buildings were among the earliest seismically protected constructions in Europe. An even more ambitious reconstruction was carried out in Paris. In 1852, Georges-Eugène Haussmann was commissioned to remodel the Medieval street plan of the city by demolishing swathes of the old quarters and laying out wide boulevards, extending outwards beyond the old city limits. Haussmann's project encompassed all aspects of urban planning, both in the centre of Paris and in the surrounding districts, with regulations imposed on building façades, public parks, sewers and water works, city facilities, and public monuments. Beyond aesthetic and sanitary considerations, the wide thoroughfares facilitated troop movement and policing.Girouard, Mark, Cities and People, 1985, London, p. 285. A concurrent plan to extend Barcelona was based on a scientific analysis of the city and its modern requirements. It was drawn up by the Catalan engineer Ildefons Cerdà to fill the space beyond the city walls after they were demolished from 1854. He is credited with inventing the term ‘urbanisation’ and his approach was codified in his General Theory of Urbanisation (1867). Cerdà's Eixample (Catalan for 'extension') consisted of 550 regular blocks with chamfered corners to facilitate the movement of trams, crossed by three wider avenues. His objectives were to improve the health of the inhabitants, towards which the blocks were built around central gardens and orientated NW-SE to maximise the sunlight they received, and assist social integration.Busquets, Joan Barcelona, the urban evolution of a compact city, 2005, , Harvard University, p. 122.  Modern urban planning  The L'Enfant Plan for Washington, D.C., as revised by Andrew Ellicott in 1792 Planning and architecture went through a paradigm shift at the turn of the 20th century. The industrialised cities of the 19th century had grown at a tremendous rate, with the pace and style of building largely dictated by private business concerns. The evils of urban life for the working poor were becoming increasingly evident as a matter for public concern. The laissez-faire style of government management of the economy, in fashion for most of the Victorian era, was starting to give way to a New Liberalism that championed intervention on the part of the poor and disadvantaged. Around 1900, theorists began developing urban planning models to mitigate the consequences of the industrial age, by providing citizens, especially factory workers, with healthier environments. Modern zoning, which enabled planners to legally demarcate sections of cities for different functions, originated in Prussia, and spread to Britain, the US, and Scandinavia.Eran Ben-Joseph, \\"Codes and Standards\\"; in Weber & Crane (2012), p. 359: \\"In their search for a scientific model for the American city, these newly formed experts looked overseas. According to Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. (1870–1957), the president of the National Planning Conference and the first president of the American City Planning Institute (1917), the model was found in Prussia (Germany). After the Franco-Prussian war (1870–1871), many Prussian cities experienced uncontrolled buildup of inner-city factories and housing, followed by dangerous health hazards and pollution. Citizens protested the deteriorating environmental conditions. Thereupon, Prussian city officials responded with a zone system that assigned particular land uses to designated locations.\\" Public health was cited as a rationale for keeping cities organized.Jason Corburn, \\"Reconnecting Urban Planning and Public Health\\"; in Weber & Crane (2012), p. 398: \\"Consistent with the emerging aesthetic and technocratic ideals of planning, tools to classify and segment city functions took hold and land-use zoning emerged as one such powerful tool. Local zoning ordinances were often couched as both protecting public health and benefiting private landowners. For example, in the landmark 1926 Supreme Court case Village of Euclid, Ohio, et al. v. Ambler Reality Company, zoning was characterized as promoting health: 'the exclusion of buildings devoted to business, trade, etc., from residential districts, bears a rational relation to the health and safety of the community...by excluding from residential areas the confusion and danger of fire, contagion and disorder, which in greater or less degree attach to the location of stores, shops, and factories' (272 U.S. 365, 392). Yet, there was little to no epidemiologic evidence at the time suggesting that health improvements would come about by physically separating land uses, and some have suggested that zoning tended to concentrate health hazards and perpetuate disadvantages in poor urban communities (Maantay 2001)\\".  Garden city movement  The concept of Arturo Soria's of the linear city model and the \\"linear city movement\\" Ebenezer Howard's influential 1902 diagram, illustrating urban growth through garden city \\"off-shoots\\" The first major urban planning theorist was Sir Ebenezer Howard, who initiated the garden city movement in 1898. This was inspired by earlier planned communities built by industrial philanthropists in the countryside, such as Cadburys' Bournville, Lever's Port Sunlight and George Pullman's eponymous Pullman in Chicago. All these settlements decentralised the working environment from the centre of the cities, and provided a healthy living space for the factory workers. Howard generalised this achievement into a planned movement for the country as a whole. He was also influenced by the work of economist Alfred Marshall who argued in 1884 that industry needed a supply of labour that could in theory be supplied anywhere, and that companies have an incentive to improve workers living standards as the company bears much of the cost inflicted by the unhealthy urban conditions in the big cities. Howard's ideas, although utopian, were also highly practical and were adopted around the world in the ensuing decades. His garden cities were intended to be planned, self-contained communities surrounded by parks, containing proportionate and separate areas of residences, industry, and agriculture. Inspired by the Utopian novel Looking Backward and Henry George's work Progress and Poverty, Howard published his book Garden Cities of To-morrow in 1898, commonly regarded as the most important book in the history of urban planning. His idealised garden city would house 32,000 people on a site of , planned on a concentric pattern with open spaces, public parks and six radial boulevards, wide, extending from the centre. The garden city would be self-sufficient and when it reached full population, another garden city would be developed nearby. Howard envisaged a cluster of several garden cities as satellites of a central city of 50,000 people, linked by road and rail. He founded First Garden City, Ltd. in 1899 to create the first garden city at Letchworth, Hertfordshire. Donors to the project collected interest on their investment if the garden city generated profits through rents or, as Fishman calls the process, ‘philanthropic land speculation’. Howard tried to include working class cooperative organisations, which included over two million members, but could not win their financial support. In 1904, Raymond Unwin, a noted architect and town planner, along with his partner Richard Barry Parker, won the competition run by the First Garden City, Limited to plan Letchworth, an area 34 miles outside London. Unwin and Parker planned the town in the centre of the Letchworth estate with Howard's large agricultural greenbelt surrounding the town, and they shared Howard's notion that the working class deserved better and more affordable housing. However, the architects ignored Howard's symmetric design, instead replacing it with a more ‘organic’ design. Welwyn Garden City, also in Hertfordshire was also built on Howard's principles. His successor as chairman of the Garden City Association was Sir Frederic Osborn, who extended the movement to regional planning. The principles of the garden city were soon applied to the planning of city suburbs. The first such project was the Hampstead Garden Suburb founded by Henrietta Barnett and planned by Parker and Unwin. The scheme's utopian ideals were that it should be open to all classes of people with free access to woods and gardens and that the housing should be of low density with wide, tree-lined roads. In North America, the Garden City movement was also popular, and evolved into the \\"Neighbourhood Unit\\" form of development. In the early 1900s, as cars were introduced to city streets for the first time, residents became increasingly concerned with the number of pedestrians being injured by car traffic. The response, seen first in Radburn, New Jersey, was the Neighbourhood Unit-style development, which oriented houses toward a common public path instead of the street. The neighbourhood is distinctively organised around a school, with the intention of providing children a safe way to walk to school.Carol Ann Christensen, The American garden city and the new towns movement (1986).Daniel Schaffer, Garden Cities for America: The Radburn Experience (Temple University Press, 1982)  Urban planning profession  Urban planning became professionalised at this period, with input from utopian visionaries as well as from the practical minded infrastructure engineers and local councillors combining to produce new design templates for political consideration. The Town and Country Planning Association was founded in 1899 and the first academic course on urban planning was offered by the University of Liverpool in 1909. The first official consideration of these new trends was embodied in the Housing and Town Planning Act of 1909 that compelled local authorities to introduce coherent systems of town planning across the country using the new principles of the 'garden city', and to ensure that all housing construction conformed to specific building standards. Following this Act, surveyors, civil engineers, architects, lawyers and others began working together within local government in the UK to draw up schemes for the development of land and the idea of town planning as a new and distinctive area of expertise began to be formed. In 1910, Thomas Adams was appointed as the first Town Planning Inspector at the Local Government Board, and began meeting with practitioners. The Town Planning Institute was established in 1914 with a mandate to advance the study of town-planning and civic design. RTPI.org.uk, About the RTPI. Retrieved 17 January 2013 The first university course in America was established at Harvard University in 1924. The Tudor Walters Committee that recommended the building of housing estates after World War One incorporated the ideas of Howard's disciple Raymond Unwin, who demonstrated that homes could be built rapidly and economically whilst maintaining satisfactory standards for gardens, family privacy and internal spaces. Unwin diverged from Howard by proposing that the new developments should be peripheral 'satellites' rather than fully-fledged garden cities.  Modernism  Partizánske in Slovakia – an example of a typical planned industrial city founded in 1938 together with a shoemaking factory in which practically all adult inhabitants of the city were employed. A 1939 model envisions Berlin transformed into the Welthauptstadt Germania (World Capital Germania). Seven Sisters in Moscow in the \\"Wedding Cake Style Buildings\\" with the \\"ring roads\\" in the city In the 1920s, the ideas of modernism began to surface in urban planning. The influential modernist architect Le Corbusier presented his scheme for a \\"Contemporary City\\" for three million inhabitants (Ville Contemporaine) in 1922. The centrepiece of this plan was the group of sixty-story cruciform skyscrapers, steel-framed office buildings encased in huge curtain walls of glass. These skyscrapers were set within large, rectangular, park-like green spaces. At the centre was a huge transportation hub that on different levels included depots for buses and trains, as well as highway intersections, and at the top, an airport. Le Corbusier had the fanciful notion that commercial airliners would land between the huge skyscrapers. He segregated pedestrian circulation paths from the roadways and glorified the automobile as a means of transportation. As one moved out from the central skyscrapers, smaller low-story, zig-zag apartment blocks (set far back from the street amid green space) housed the inhabitants. Le Corbusier hoped that politically minded industrialists in France would lead the way with their efficient Taylorist and Fordist strategies adopted from American industrial models to re-organise society.Evenson, Norma. Le Corbusier: The Machine and the Grand Design. George Braziller, Pub: New York, 1969 (p.7). In 1925, he exhibited his Plan Voisin, in which he proposed to bulldoze most of central Paris north of the Seine and replace it with his sixty-story cruciform towers from the Contemporary City, placed within an orthogonal street grid and park-like green space. In the 1930s, Le Corbusier expanded and reformulated his ideas on urbanism, eventually publishing them in La Ville radieuse (The Radiant City) in 1935. Perhaps the most significant difference between the Contemporary City and the Radiant City is that the latter abandoned the class-based stratification of the former; housing was now assigned according to family size, not economic position.Robert Fishman, Urban Utopias in the Twentieth Century: Ebenezer Howard, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Le Corbusier (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1982), 231. Le Corbusier's theories were sporadically adopted by the builders of public housing in Europe and the United States. Many of his disciples became notable in their own right, including painter-architect Nadir Afonso, who absorbed Le Corbusier's ideas into his own aesthetics theory. Lúcio Costa's city plan of Brasília and the industrial city of Zlín planned by František Lydie Gahura in the Czech Republic are notable plans based on his ideas, while the architect himself produced the plan for Chandigarh in India. Le Corbusier's thinking also had been profoundly effected by the philosophy of Futurism and Constructivism in Russia at the turn of the 20th century. Another important theorist was Sir Patrick Geddes who understood the importance of taking the regional environment into account and the relationship between social issues and town planning, and foresaw the emergence of huge urban conurbations. In 1927, he was commissioned to plan the city of Tel Aviv, then in Mandatory Palestine. It consisted of about 40 blocks, sized around 150 metres squared. The block contained an inner small public garden, disposed into a windmill configuration of inner access roads, making it awkward for car traffic. The big blocks form a gently undulating street pattern, north–south commercial, east–west arranged to catch the sea breeze. This was a simple and efficient manner to modernise the historical fixed grid patterns. A series of shaded boulevards short cuts the system, with some public squares, accessing the sea front. The plan of the new town became a success. Urban planning in communist countries has often modeled itself on Western modernism, using the authority of the state to implement efficient urban designs produced in administrative centers. (In Russia this process was nominally decentralized after the end of the USSR, but Moscow remains the source of much of the country's urban planning expertise.)John Friedman, \\"Varieties of Planning Experience: Toward a Globalized Planning Culture?\\"; in Weber & Crane (2012). Germany under national socialism also undertook grandiose schemes for urban redesign.Cuthbert (2006), p. 56: \\"Rationalist architecture and urbanism reached its zenith in its coincidence with functionalist social science and the eugenic strategies of fascism, particularly with Hitler and his architect Albert Speer, and with Mussolini (Marcello Piacentini, Giuseppi Terragni).\\"  New Towns  Ebenezer Howard's urban planning concepts were only adopted on a large scale after World War II. The damage brought on by the war provoked significant public interest in what post-war Britain would be like, which was encouraged by the government, who facilitated talk about a ‘Better Britain’ to boost morale. Post-war rebuilding initiatives saw new plans drafted for London, which, for the first time, addressed the issue of de-centralisation. Firstly, the County of London Plan 1943 recognised that displacement of population and employment was necessary if the city was to be rebuilt at a desirable density. Moreover, the Greater London Plan of 1944 went further by suggesting that over one million people would need to be displaced into a mixture of satellite suburbs, existing rural towns, and new towns.Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‘New Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress’. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963.pp 55 The New Towns Act 1946 resulted in many New Towns being constructed in Britain over the following decades.Osborn, J and Whittick, A. 1977. ‘New Towns: Their Origins, Achievements, and Progress’. Third Ed. Leonard Hill, London. First Pub 1963.pp56.Hall, P and Ward, C. 1998. ‘Sociable Cities: the Legacy of Ebenezer Howard’. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester pp. 41-69. New towns were built in the United States from the 1960s – examples include Reston, Virginia; Columbia, Maryland; Jonathan, Minnesota and Riverside Plaza. This construction effort was combined with extensive federal government grants for slum clearance, improved and increased housing and road construction and comprehensive urban renewal projects. Other European countries such as France, Germany, Italy and Sweden also had some successes with new towns, especially as part of post-war reconstruction efforts.  Contemporary  Urban planning has grown in prominence with rising urbanization.Rachel Weber & Randall Crane, \\"Planning as Scholarship: Origins and Prospects\\"; in Weber & Crane (2012).  Reaction against modernism  By the late 1960s and early 1970s, many planners felt that modernism's clean lines and lack of human scale sapped vitality from the community, blaming them for high crime rates and social problems.Smith Morris et al. British Town Planning and Urban Design, 1997, , Longman, Singapore. Modernist planning fell into decline in the 1970s when the construction of cheap, uniform tower blocks ended in most countries, such as Britain and France. Since then many have been demolished and replaced by other housing types. Rather than attempting to eliminate all disorder, planning now concentrates on individualism and diversity in society and the economy; this is the post-modernist era. Minimally planned cities still exist. Houston is a large city (with a metropolitan population of 5.5 million) in a developed country without a comprehensive zoning ordinance. Houston does, however, restrict development densities and mandate parking, even though specific land uses are not regulated. Also, private-sector developers in Houston use subdivision covenants and deed restrictions to effect land-use restrictions resembling zoning laws. Houston voters have rejected comprehensive zoning ordinances three times since 1948.  Behaviorism  Behaviorist psychology influenced urban planning especially in the 1960s and after, manifesting in such theories as defensible space and crime prevention through environmental design.Cuthbert (2006), pp. 102–104.  New Urbanism  Jakriborg in Sweden, started in the late 1990s as a new urbanist eco-friendly new town near Malmö Various current movements in urban design seek to create sustainable urban environments with long-lasting structures, buildings and a great liveability for its inhabitants. The most clearly defined form of walkable urbanism is known as the Charter of New Urbanism. It is an approach for successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve smart cities that support sustainable transport. Residents in compact urban neighbourhoods drive fewer miles and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures compared with those living in sprawling suburbs.Ewing, R \\"Growing Cooler - the Evidence on Urban Development and Climate Change\\" . Retrieved on: 2009-03-16. The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land taken by urban sprawl. A road crossing at UNCTAD XIII in Doha, Qatar. Traffic in Qatar is separated into two roads, one serving each direction. In sustainable construction, the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards urban construction that appreciates and develops smart growth, walkability, architectural tradition, and classical design. This is in contrast to modernist and short-lived globally uniform architecture, as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl.Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23. Both trends started in the 1980s. Critics of New Urbanism have argued that its environmental aspect is too focused on transport and excessive individual mobility. The real problem with the unsustainable nature of modern cities is not just about cars and too much driving - it is about the entire urban metabolism of the city (of which auto-mobility is less than half of the overall ecological footprint and accounts for about half of the GHG emissions/carbon footprint). They have also argued that land-use planning can do little to achieve sustainability without regulating the design and associated technology of the actual development within a zoned area. Distances and density are relatively unimportant; it is the total metabolism of the development that determines the environmental impact. Also, the emphasis needs to shift from sustainability to resilience, and the spatial scope from the city to the whole urban region.Bogunovich, D \\"From planning sustainable cities to designing resilient urban regions \\". Retrieved on: 2014-12-06. A further criticism is that the New Urbanist project of compacting urban form is a difficult and slow process. In the new global situation, with the horizontal, low-density growth irreversibly dominant, and climate change already happening, it would be wiser to focus efforts on the resilience of whole city-regions, retrofitting the existing sprawl for sustainability and self-sufficiency, and investing heavily in 'green infrastructure'.Bogunovich, D \\"Urban Sustainability 2.0: Resilient regions, sustainable sprawl and green infrastructure\\". Retrieved on: 2014-12-06.  Sustainable development and sustainability  Sustainable development has emerged in recent decades as guiding themes for urban planning. This term was defined and advocated in 1987 report Our Common Future, published by the World Commission on Environment and Development.Jerke, Porter & Lassar (2008), p. 11: \\"Recognition that the economic and social future of the planet would require maintaining the integrity of natural systems led, in the 1980s, to international efforts to promote economic development that respects the functions of national systems while advancing social equity. The Brundtland Commission, a United Nations entity, formulated a mission statement for sustainable development in its 1987 report that expresses the guiding spirit of sustainability: 'development that integrates environmental, economic, and social concerns and can meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.' This mission statement has launched a multitude of activities and interests focused on overcoming issues such as international trade barriers, widespread poverty, overpopulation, and climate change.\\" Robert Hoddle's survey of Melbourne in 1837. The layout of the city is referred to as the \\"Hoddle Grid\\". Some planners argue that modern lifestyles use too many natural resources, polluting or destroying ecosystems, increasing social inequality, creating urban heat islands, and causing climate change. Many urban planners, therefore, advocate sustainable cities. However, sustainable development is a recent, controversial concept. Wheeler, in his 2004 book, defines sustainable urban development as \\"development that improves the long-term social and ecological health of cities and towns.\\" He sketches a 'sustainable' city's features: compact, efficient land use; less automobile use, yet better access; efficient resource use; less pollution and waste; the restoration of natural systems; good housing and living environments; a healthy social ecology; a sustainable economy; community participation and involvement; and preservation of local culture and wisdom. Urban planners are now promoting a sustainable city model, which consists of cities that are designed with consideration of environmental impacts, such as minimising the uses of energy, water, and the outputs of waste and pollution. Because of political and governance structures in most jurisdictions, sustainable planning measures must be widely supported before they can affect institutions and regions. Actual implementation is often a complex compromise.Oregon Ballot Measures 37 (2004) and 49 (2007) Nature in cities Often an integral party of sustainable cities is the Incorporation of nature within a city. Car free sustainability in city planning can include large pedestrian zones or be a totally Car free.  Collaborative planning in the United States  Collaborative planning arose in the US in response to the inadequacy of traditional public participation techniques to provide real opportunities for the public to make decisions affecting their communities. Collaborative planning is a method designed to empower stakeholders by elevating them to the level of decision-makers through direct engagement and dialogue between stakeholders and public agencies, to solicit ideas, active involvement, and participation in the community planning process. Active public involvement can help planners achieve better outcomes by making them aware of the public's needs and preferences and by using local knowledge to inform projects. When properly administered, collaboration can result in more meaningful participation and better, more creative outcomes to persistent problems than traditional participation methods. It enables planners to make decisions that reflect community needs and values, it fosters faith in the wisdom and utility of the resulting project, and the community is given a personal stake in its success. Experiences in Portland and Seattle have demonstrated that successful collaborative planning depends on a number of interrelated factors: the process must be truly inclusive, with all stakeholders and affected groups invited to the table; the community must have final decision-making authority; full government commitment (of both financial and intellectual resources) must be manifest; participants should be given clear objectives by planning staff, who facilitate the process by providing guidance, consultancy, expert opinions, and research; and facilitators should be trained in conflict resolution and community organisation.

He is best known for his part in Strilekrigen, an 18th-century farmer's rebellion, in Bergen.Nicolay Nicolaysen, norska stiftelser, III, 575. 882:e Early life He was probably born at Akershus Fortress in Christiania (now Oslo, Norway). He was the son of Major General Frederik Christoph von Cicignon (-1719) and Karen Hausmann (1682-1744). He was also the grandson of the Luxembourg-born military officer and engineer, Johan Caspar von Cicignon (1625-1696). He studied at the Académie des Chevaliers in Strasbourg and the Académie de Lorraine in Nancy, France. Career In 1718, he was appointed First Lieutenant within the Søndenfjeldske Gevorbne Infantry Regiment. He became captain in 1720 and then rose through the ranks until 1746 when he was made Colonel and head of the 2nd Vesterlenske National Infantry Regiment. In 1749, he had been appointed stiftamtmann in Bergen. He was regiment commander in 1750. He was knighted in 1754 with the title of Major General and became a member of the Privy Council in 1764. Role in Strilekrigen In autumn 1762, the national government in Copenhagen established an extra per capita tax for every person over twelve years, which was later reduced to a charge per household. These extra taxes were intended to help pay loans from foreign governments and to support the price of the Danish-Norwegian currency at the stock market in Hamburg. Strilekrigen took place in Bergen on 18 April 1765, when about 2,000 common people from Nordhordland poured into Bergen to protest against the harsh action of the extra tax. The extra tax had hit the poor farmers and fishermen in rural areas around Bergen particularly hard. The protests, which became violent, were particularly directed at Cicignon. Rebellions of this magnitude was unprecedented in the 18th century, and officials in Copenhagen were appalled. The authorities send an inquiry north consisting of top officials on a warship. The leaders of the rebellion were indicted by the general court and were convicted of disturbance of public order. The result was that a few farmers ended in prison for life after being pardoned from the death sentence. The extra tax was later abolished in Norway in 1772 but continued in force in Denmark. After the rebellion Cicignon sought and received dismissal as stiftamtmann in May 1766. He moved to Sønderborg in the Duchy of Schleswig, where he died in 1772.

Aesthetics  Towns and cities have been planned with aesthetics in mind. Here in Bath, England, 18th-century private sector development was designed to appear attractive In developed countries, there has been a backlash against excessive human-made clutter in the visual environment, such as signposts, signs, and hoardings. Other issues that generate strong debate among urban designers are tensions between peripheral growth, housing density and new settlements. There are also debates about the mixing tenures and land uses, versus distinguishing geographic zones where different uses dominate. Regardless, all successful urban planning considers urban character, local identity, respects heritage, pedestrians, traffic, utilities and natural hazards. Planners can help manage the growth of cities, applying tools like zoning and growth management to manage the uses of land. Historically, many of the cities now thought the most beautiful are the result of dense, long lasting systems of prohibitions and guidance about building sizes, uses and features.Christopher Alexander, A Pattern Language, Towns Buildings, Construction These allowed substantial freedoms, yet enforce styles, safety, and often materials in practical ways. Many conventional planning techniques are being repackaged using the contemporary term smart growth. There are some cities that have been planned from conception, and while the results often do not turn out quite as planned, evidence of the initial plan often remains. (See List of planned cities) The 20th and 21st century trend for New Classical Architecture seeks to develop aesthetically pleasing smart growth in urban areas and to continue architectural tradition and classical design.  Safety and security  The medieval walled city of Carcassonne in France is built upon high ground to provide maximum protection from attackers. Historically within the Middle East, Europe and the rest of the Old World, settlements were located on higher ground (for defense) and close to fresh water sources. Cities have often grown onto coastal and flood plains at risk of floods and storm surges. Urban planners must consider these threats. If the dangers can be localised then the affected regions can be made into parkland or green belt, often with the added benefit of open space provision. Extreme weather, flood, or other emergencies can often be greatly mitigated with secure emergency evacuation routes and emergency operations centres. These are relatively inexpensive and unintrusive, and many consider them a reasonable precaution for any urban space. Many cities will also have planned, built safety features, such as levees, retaining walls, and shelters. In recent years, practitioners have also been expected to maximise the accessibility of an area to people with different abilities, practicing the notion of \\"inclusive design,\\" to anticipate criminal behaviour and consequently to \\"design-out crime\\" and to consider \\"traffic calming\\" or \\"pedestrianisation\\" as ways of making urban life more pleasant. Some city planners try to control criminality with structures designed from theories such as socio-architecture or architectural determinism a subset of environmental determinism. These theories say that an urban environment can influence individuals' obedience to social rules and level of power. Refer to Foucault and the Encyclopaedia of the Prison System for more details. The theories often say that psychological pressure develops in more densely developed, unadorned areas. This stress causes some crimes and some use of illegal drugs. The antidote is believed to be more individual space and better, more beautiful design in place of functionalism. Oscar Newman’s defensible space theory cites the modernist housing projects of the 1960s as an example of environmental determinism, where large blocks of flats are surrounded by shared and disassociated public areas, which are hard for residents to identify with. As those on lower incomes cannot hire others to maintain public space such as security guards or grounds keepers, and because no individual feels personally responsible, there was a general deterioration of public space leading to a sense of alienation and social disorder. Jane Jacobs is another notable environmental determinist and is associated with the \\"eyes on the street\\" concept. By improving ‘natural surveillance’ of shared land and facilities of nearby residents by literally increasing the number of people who can see it, and increasing the familiarity of residents, as a collective, residents can more easily detect undesirable or criminal behaviour, as, she argued, used to be the case in small traditional communities. Jacobs went further, though, in emphasising the details in how to achieve this 'natural surveillance', in stressing the necessity of multiple uses on city streets, so that different people co-mingle with different stores and parks in a condensed part of city space. By doing this, as well as by making city streets interesting, she theorised a continuous animation of social actions during an average city day, which would keep city streets interesting and well occupied throughout a 24-hour period. She presented the North End in Boston, Massachusetts, as an idealisation of this persistent occupation and tasking in a condensed city space, as a model for criminal control. The \\"broken-windows\\" theory argues that small indicators of neglect, such as broken windows and unkempt lawns, promote a feeling that an area is in a state of decay. Anticipating decay, people likewise fail to maintain their own properties. The theory suggests that abandonment causes crime, rather than crime causing abandonment.George L. Kelling, Catherine M. Coles, Fixing Broken Windows: Restoring Order And Reducing Crime In Our Communities Some planning methods might help an elite group to control ordinary citizens. Haussmann's renovation of Paris created a system of wide boulevards which prevented the construction of barricades in the streets and eased the movement of military troops. In Rome, the Fascists in the 1930s created ex novo many new suburbs in order to concentrate criminals and poorer classes away from the elegant town.  Decay  Urban decay is a process by which a city, or a part of a city, falls into a state of disrepair and neglect. It is characterised by depopulation, economic restructuring, property abandonment, high unemployment, fragmented families, political disenfranchisement, crime, and desolate urban landscapes. During the 1970s and 1980s, urban decay was often associated with central areas of cities in North America and Europe. During this time, changes in global economies, demographics, transportation, and policies fostered urban decay.Urban Sores: On the Interaction Between Segregation, Urban Decay, and Deprived Neighbourhoods By Hans Skifter Andersen. . 2003. Many planners spoke of \\"white flight\\" during this time. This pattern was different from the pattern of \\"outlying slums\\" and \\"suburban ghettos\\" found in many cities outside of North America and Western Europe, where central urban areas actually had higher real estate values. Starting in the 1990s, many of the central urban areas in North America have been experiencing a reversal of the urban decay, with rising real estate values, smarter development, demolition of obsolete social housing and a wider variety of housing choices. However, reversal of urban decay (gentrification) often causes housing affordability in the inner city to decrease, with the consequence that poorer residents are pushed out, often to older inner and middle ring suburbs. This \\"suburbanisation of poverty\\" has important implications for siting affordable housing, and transportation and social services planning.  Slums  The rapid urbanisation of the last century caused more slums in the major cities of the world, particularly in developing countries. Planning resources and strategies are needed to address the problems of slum development. Many planners are calling for slum improvement, particularly the Commonwealth Association of Planners.Reinventing planning: A new governance paradigm for managing Human settlements, Commonwealth Association of Planners When urban planners work on slums, they must cope with racial and cultural differences to ensure that racial steering does not occur. Slums were often \\"fixed\\" by clearance. However, more creative solutions are beginning to emerge such as Nairobi's \\"Camp of Fire\\" program, where established slum-dwellers promise to build proper houses, schools, and community centres without government money, in return for land on which they have been illegally squatting on for 30 years. The \\"Camp of Fire\\" program is one of many similar projects initiated by Slum Dwellers International, which has programs in Africa, Asia, and South America.The Christian Science Monitor: Kenyans buy into slum plan, 26 May 2004  Reconstruction and renewal  The overall area plan for the reconstruction of Kabul's Old City area, the proposed Kabul - City of Light Development Areas devastated by war or invasion challenge urban planners. Resources are scarce. The existing population has needs. Buildings, roads, services and basic infrastructure like power, water and sewerage are often damaged, but with salvageable parts. Historic, religious or social centres also need to be preserved and re-integrated into the new city plan. A prime example of this is the capital city of Kabul, Afghanistan, which, after decades of civil war and occupation, has regions of rubble and desolation. Despite this, the indigenous population continues to live in the area, constructing makeshift homes and shops out of salvaged materials. Any reconstruction plan, such as Hisham Ashkouri's City of Light Development, needs to be sensitive to the needs of this community and its existing culture and businesses. Urban reconstruction development plans must also work with government agencies as well as private interests to develop workable designs.  New master-planned cities  In the 21st Century, countries in Asia and the Middle East have embarked on plans to build brand new large cities. Masdar City, a new city in the UAE, cost $18 billion.

Transport  Very densely built-up areas require high capacity urban transit, and urban planners must consider these factors in long term plans (Canary Wharf tube station) Although an important factor, there is a complex relationship between urban densities and car use Wilton Road, Pimlico, London showing two-way traffic on a single roadway Transport within urbanised areas presents unique problems. The density of an urban environment increases traffic, which can harm businesses and increase pollution unless properly managed. Parking space for private vehicles requires the construction of large parking garages in high density areas. This space could often be more valuable for other development. Good planning uses transit oriented development, which attempts to place higher densities of jobs or residents near high-volume transportation. For example, some cities permit commerce and multi-story apartment buildings only within one block of train stations and multilane boulevards, and accept single-family dwellings and parks farther away. Floor area ratio is often used to measure density. This is the floor area of buildings divided by the land area. Ratios below 1.5 are low density. Ratios above five constitute very high density. Most exurbs are below two, while most city centres are well above five. Walk-up apartments with basement garages can easily achieve a density of three. Skyscrapers easily achieve densities of thirty or more. City authorities may try to encourage higher densities to reduce per-capita infrastructure costs. In the UK, recent years have seen a concerted effort to increase the density of residential development in order to better achieve sustainable development. Increasing development density has the advantage of making mass transport systems, district heating and other community facilities (schools, health centres, etc.) more viable. However critics of this approach dub the densification of development as 'town cramming' and claim that it lowers quality of life and restricts market-led choice. Problems can often occur at residential densities between about two and five.Stewart Brand, How Buildings Learn These densities can cause traffic jams for automobiles, yet are too low to be commercially served by trains or light rail systems. The conventional solution is to use buses, but these and light rail systems may fail where automobiles and excess road network capacity are both available, achieving less than 2% ridership.Transportation Efficient Land Use- Municipal Services and Research Center of Washington, Accessed 09nov09, says that each 40% increase in density reduces trips by 20–30%. The Lewis–Mogridge Position claims that increasing road space is not an effective way of relieving traffic jams as latent or induced demand invariably emerges to restore a socially tolerable level of congestion.  Suburbanisation  Low-density (auto- oriented) suburban development near Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States In some countries, declining satisfaction with the urban environment is held to blame for continuing migration to smaller towns and rural areas (so-called urban exodus). Successful urban planning supported Regional planning can bring benefits to a much larger hinterland or city region and help to reduce both congestion along transport routes and the wastage of energy implied by excessive commuting.  Environmental factors  Environmental protection and conservation are of utmost importance to many planning systems across the world. Not only are the specific effects of development to be mitigated, but attempts are made to minimise the overall effect of development on the local and global environment. This is commonly done through the assessment of Sustainable urban infrastructure and microclimate.  Zoning  Roads in Kuwait. Traffic here is divided into separate roads, one serving each direction. The primary purpose of zoning is to segregate uses that are thought to be incompatible. In practice, zoning is used to prevent new development from interfering with existing residents or businesses and to preserve the \\"character\\" of a community. Zoning is commonly controlled by local governments such as counties or municipalities, though the nature of the zoning regime may be determined or limited by state or national planning authorities or through enabling legislation.E.g., Maryland Code Article 66B, § 2.01(b) grants zoning powers to the City of Baltimore, while § 2.01(c) limits the grant of powers. By contrast, the New Jersey Municipal Land Use Law grants uniform zoning powers (with uniform limitations) to all municipalities in that state. In Australia, land under the control of the Commonwealth (federal) government is not subject to state planning controls. The United States and other federal countries are similar. Zoning and urban planning in France and Germany are regulated by national or federal codes. In the case of Germany this code includes contents of zoning plans as well as the legal procedure. Zoning may include regulation of the kinds of activities which will be acceptable on particular lots (such as open space, residential, agricultural, commercial or industrial), the densities at which those activities can be performed (from low-density housing such as single family homes to high-density such as high- rise apartment buildings), the height of building process is known as a Sustainability Appraisal.  Light and sound  The urban canyon effect is a colloquial, non-scientific term referring to street space bordered by very high buildings. This type of environment may shade the sidewalk level from direct sunlight during most daylight hours. While an oft-decried phenomenon, it is rare except in very dense, hyper-tall urban environments, such as those found in Lower and Midtown Manhattan, Chicago's Loop and Hong Kong's Kowloon and Central. In urban planning, sound is usually measured as a source of pollution. Another perspective on urban sounds is developed in Soundscape studies emphasising that sound aesthetics involves more than noise abatement and decibel measurements. Hedfors2003 Site Soundscapes – Landscape Architecture in the Light of Sound – Per Hedfors () – book & CD-Rom coined 'Sonotope' as a useful concept in urban planning to relate typical sounds to a specific place. Light pollution has become a problem in urban residential areas, not only as it relates to its effects on the night sky, but as some lighting is so intrusive as to cause conflict in the residential areas and paradoxically intense improperly installed security lighting may pose a danger to the public, producing excessive glare. The development of the full cutoff fixture, properly installed, has reduced this problem considerably.  Water and sanitation infrastructure   Access and health impacts  Water and sanitation services are key considerations in the planning of cities. This encompasses water provision, waste-water treatment, and sewage infrastructure. These services are crucial for public health – thus, one aspect of urban planning is to consider how to best provide these services to urban residents in effective and cost-sensitive ways. Within urban environments, there are a number of disparities with regards to access to these services. For example, as of 2006, among the poorest quartile of the urban population in India, over 80% lacked access to piped water at home and over half did not have sanitary flushes or pit toilets.Agarwal, Siddharth. \\"The state of urban health in India; comparing the poorest quartile to the rest of the urban population in selected states and cities.\\" Environment and Urbanization 23.1 (2011): 13–28 Data collected in 2005–2006 revealed that under half of the urban poor could access adequate sanitation compared to about 95% of the urban non- poor.Chaplin, Susan E. \\"Indian cities, sanitation and the state: the politics of the failure to provide.\\" Environment and Urbanization 23.1 (2011): 57–70. In India, slums compose a major part of the urban environment – one of the largest barriers to improving slum conditions is that many slums go undocumented. Because most slums are informal settlements with no tenure rights, their illegal status excludes them from official listings and thus excludes them from access to municipal water and sanitation services.Agarwal, Siddharth, et al. \\"Urbanization, urban poverty and health of the urban poor: status, challenges and the way forward.\\" Demography India 36.1 (2007): 121. Economic status is highly correlated to water and sanitation service access in urban environments. But economic status is often tied to other demographic characteristics such as caste, ethnicity, and race. Therefore, access to water and sanitation services is an equity issue that faces urban planners working for urban governments. In the absence of policy to address these infrastructural disparities, the urban poor and minorities suffer disproportionately. A study of the social determinants of children’s health in urban settings in India looked at data from India’s National Family Health Survey and found that even within poor urban areas, caste status, religion, and sex are major factors which determine family employment and education level, factors which in turn affect access to sanitation and water.Agarwal, Siddharth, and Aradhana Srivastava. \\"Social Determinants of Children's Health in Urban Areas in India.\\" Journal of health care for the poor and underserved 20.4A (2009): 68-89. Water and sanitation issues relate directly to health outcomes due to the susceptibility to disease experienced by populations that lack adequate access. In the 19th and 20th centuries, diseases like cholera were particularly feared due to their devastating effects and due to their proliferation in areas with poor waste management practices.Chaplin, Susan E. \\"Cities, sewers and poverty: India's politics of sanitation.\\" Environment and Urbanization 11.1 (1999): 145–158. Today diseases such as dengue fever, Hepatitis A, and intestinal parasites, are all examples of water-borne illnesses that affect the urban poor. Diarrheal illnesses are perhaps today the leading type of waterborne disease with cities like Jakarta experiencing disease rates as high as 50 cases per 1000 people.Alirol, Emilie, et al. \\"Urbanisation and infectious diseases in a globalised world.\\" The Lancet Infectious Diseases 11.2 (2011): 131–141. In India, waterborne disease accounts for the loss of roughly 180 million person-workdays annually, the economic equivalent of approximately 12 billion rupees. Thus inadequate access to water and sanitation among the urban poor and socially disadvantaged leads to systematic vulnerability to disease, which has both public health and economic consequences. In Uganda, in order to address some of these access issues, NGOs and community-based organisations (CBOs) have stepped in. The government in Uganda has acknowledged the role of sanitation in improving public health among the poor, but as NGOs and CBOs have pointed out, the government has been unable to adequately address the need for these services in urban environments or the high cost of procuring these services from private service providers.Tukahirwa, J. T., A. P. J. Mol, and P. Oosterveer. \\"Access of urban poor to NGO/CBO-supplied sanitation and solid waste services in Uganda: The role of social proximity.\\" Habitat International 35.4 (2011): 582–591. However, NGOs and CBOs are inherently limited in their ability to provide sanitation services, however, due to the need to obtain permissions for undertaking infrastructure projects and due to the high costs of implementing them.  Latrines  One aspect of sanitation infrastructure that is a major determinant of environmental health in slums is the latrine. There are a number of variables surrounding latrines and sewage which can play a critical role in determining health outcomes for urban families, including latrine location (in house versus out of house), latrine usage (family vs community), and latrine type (for example pit latrine versus toilet). Furthermore, the latrine is a critical aspect of urban household-level layouts and designs.  Waste-water  Waste-water collection and treatment has always been an important consideration in urban planning, but it is becoming increasingly critical as urban population levels rise and water conservation becomes a growing concern. Many planners are now considering how to properly incorporate waste-water treatment into urban environments in effective, and equitable ways. In the US, prior to the 19th century, cities often used a de- centralised privy vault-cesspool model for waste management. Urban households had vaults or tubs beneath their latrines, which would collect waste-water until the vaults needed to be emptied into a nearby cesspool. This model worked at the time due to relatively low urban populations. However, industrialisation, urbanisation, and population growth during the 19th century led to a dramatic increase in America’s city-dwelling population and thus increased the need for a centralised waste-water collection and processing system.Burian, Steven J., et al. \\"Urban wastewater management in the United States: Past, present, and future.\\" Journal of Urban Technology 7.3 (2000): 33–62. With the introduction of piped water, such a centralised system became possible as larger quantities of water were necessary for water-carriage waste removal. Since the 19th century, water-carriage sewage management has been preferred by planners due to its scalability. However, more recently, de- centralised waste water management has made a resurgence among planners and researchers. While centralised water-carriage systems have more potential for scalability, de-centralised systems are simply more efficient because the waste-water is managed closer to where it is generated, thus allowing for each management system to be adapted to the local community/household needs.Wilderer, P., and D. Schreff. \\"Decentralized and centralized wastewater management: a challenge for technology developers.\\" Water Science and Technology 41.1 (2000): 1–8.

Featuring an ensemble cast consisting of Arya, Bobby Simha and Sri Divya in the lead roles, it tells the story of three cousins who live their childhood dream of living and enjoying in the city of Bangalore. It also stars Rana Daggubati, Parvathy (reprising her role from the original) and Raai Laxmi and in other pivotal roles. Produced by Prasad V Potluri under his banner PVP cinema, the film released on 5 February 2016. Unlike the original, this movie received mixed reviews and failed at the box office, with critics and fans drawing comparisons with the original. Plot The film's story revolves around three cousins Arjun \\"Ajju\\" (Arya), Kannan \\"Kutty\\" (Bobby Simha), and Divya \\"Ammu\\" Raghavan (Sri Divya), who share a close bond since their childhood. Kutty is a software engineer whose heart and soul are still in his village. Ajju, whose parents are divorced, is a bike mechanic who lives his life on his own terms. Ammu has completed her B.Com and aspires to do her MBA from IIM but is compelled to marry a workaholic corporate executive, Shivaprasad \\"Prasad\\" (Rana Daggubati) because of her family astrologer's dire predictions. After their wedding, Ammu moves to Bangalore as Prasad is settled there. Kutty too relocates to Bangalore for his job, while Ajju joins a biker gang as a mechanic in the same city. Ammu feels lonely as Prasad often goes on long corporate trips and ignores her. Her only solace is the time she gets to spend with her cousins. One day, upon inspecting a room in their apartment that Prasad never lets anyone enter, she is shocked to find it filled with photos, knickknacks and possessions of a woman (Samantha). In thought of not having a place in Prasad's heart and life, she leaves Prasad and returns to her village in sorrow. Naive Kutty, who wants a traditional, modest, saree-clad girl for a wife, falls in love with an air hostess Lakshmi (Raai Laxmi) on a flight from Bangalore to Coimbatore. They date, and Kutty changes from a reserved and shy person to a trendy person to impress her, but his dreams are shattered when her ex-boyfriend (Arjun G Iyengar) arrives at her apartment, and he realizes that she was only trying to get back with him. He breaks off his relationship with her. Ajju was a bike racer, but due to a misdemeanor, he is forced to serve a one-year ban from racing. Rakesh, who is now a top-bike racer, troubles Ajju. Ajju eventually hits him but is stopped by Coach Zachariah (Sijoy Varghese). Rakesh tells that Ajju is best at fighting, but he is best in racing. Ajju falls for RJ Sarah (Parvathy), but when he meets her in person, he finds she is a paraplegic. He starts to like her attitude and follows her. They become good friends, but Ajju is saddened when he learns that Sarah is to leave for Australia on a university scholarship. Meanwhile, as Ammu and Prasad are in the middle of getting a divorce, Ajju learns that a few years back, Prasad was a bike racer. He then went by the name Shiva and was the leader of his biker gang. Shiva had given up on racing after he was involved in an accident that killed his girlfriend Grace (the girl whose photos and possessions that Ammu had discovered in Prasad's room). Upon knowing what happened, Ammu decides to return to Bangalore and works towards her MBA. She gradually wins over a repentant Prasad and soon arranges for him to meet Grace's parents (Prakash Raj and Vinaya Prasad). After the meeting, Prasad is able to let go of his past. Ammu forgives him, and they get their marital life on track. Ajju gets a chance to race on the same day that Sarah has to leave for Australia. Rakesh also arrives. With Ammu, Kutty and Prasad cheering for him, he wins the race. After the race, Ajju realizes how important Sarah is to him and his life. He pleads with her not to go to Australia. Sarah forgoes her scholarship to stay with him in Bangalore. In the end, Kutty marries his neighbor in Bangalore, a European Bharathanatyam dancer Michelle (Paris Laxmi), who has embraced the culture of India. The film ends with Ammu, Prasad, Ajju, and Sarah breaking into Kutty's room and all of them posing for a photo.

Bommarillu Bhaskar was signed on to direct the film, while the producers sought to cast the seven lead roles from actors who were renowned in both the Tamil and Telugu film industries. Initial reports suggested that the main lead role portrayed by Dulquer Salman would be played by Arya and the roles of the other two cousins would be played by Naga Chaitanya and Samantha Ruth Prabhu. Siddharth was also approached to portray the supporting role played by Fahadh Faasil, while Prasanna and Bharath were also linked to roles in the film. Similarly reports suggested that Nani and Sharwanand were being considered to portray two of the lead roles instead. The team also approached Nazriya to be a part of the cast, but the actress was reluctant to feature in films after her marriage.http://behindwoods.com/tamil-director/bommarilu- bhaskar/-bommarilu-bhaskar-interview.html However a delay in casting led to the film being delayed till the following year. Casting In January 2015, the official cast of the film was announced with Arya, Siddharth and Samantha selected, as initially expected. Nithya Menon was also added to the cast to play a different character instead of her role from the original. Meanwhile, Bobby Simha and Sunil were also signed on to play the same role, with Simha in the Tamil film and Sunil in the Telugu version. Simha had requested PVP Cinemas to cast him in the role after being approached by the production studio for a different film. However, by the end of the month, Siddharth and Samantha exited amidst speculation that the pair were uncomfortable to feature opposite each other, after a recent break-up. Subsequently, Rana Daggubati and Sri Divya were bought into replace the pair, while Parvathy Thiruvothu opted to reprise her role from the original ahead of Nithya. Raai Laxmi was signed on to portray the role played by Isha Talwar, while it was reported that Nayantara was in talks to portray a guest appearance in the film. Nayantara eventually was replaced by Samantha, who worked on the film for a week, shooting for a guest role. Despite indications that Santhosh Narayanan would be selected to compose the film's music, Gopi Sunder was retained from the original. The film was launched in mid March 2015 in Chennai, with the cast attending the ceremony. It was revealed that the Telugu version of the film would be made by a completely different team led by Dil Raju and would start after the Tamil version. Music The soundtrack features 6 songs composed by Gopi Sunder. The song I Want To Fly is the featured in the film as \\"Unnodu Vazha\\" with lyrics completely in Tamil instead of the original English version. ; Track list Critical reception Hindustan Times wrote \\"Bommarillu Bhaskar’s just opened Tamil work, Bangalore Naatkal – which is a remake of Anjali Menon’s Bangalore Days in Malayalam – also lends itself to a good measure of comparison.

The daughter of American millionaire Marshall Field, she enjoyed a lavish lifestyle. Early life Ethel was born in Cook County, Illinois in 1873. Her parents were Marshall Field (1834–1906), the founder of the American firm Marshall Field's, and his first wife, Nannie Douglas Scott (1840–1896). She had one full brother, Marshall Field Jr. Personal life On January 1, 1891, Ethel married Arthur Magie Tree in an opulent ceremony held at the home of her parents, 1905 Prairie Avenue in Chicago. Arthur was the son of American diplomat Lambert Tree and the former Anna Josephine Magie. Together, they were the parents of three children, only one of whom survived to adulthood: * Arthur Ronald Lambert Field Tree (1897–1976), who became a Member of Parliament and, during the Second World War became a link between the British and United States governments, lending his country house, Ditchley Park near Oxford, to Winston Churchill for weekend visits when the official residences were considered unsafe. While married to Tree, she had an affair with British captain David Beatty. Ethel wrote to her husband, telling him that it was her firm intention never to live with him again as his wife, though not naming any particular person or reason. Arthur agreed to co-operate, and filed for divorce in America on the grounds of desertion, which was granted 9 May 1901. Second marriage Dingley Hall Ten days after her divorce from Tree was made public, she was married to Captain Beatty on 22 May 1901 at the registry office, St. George's, Hanover Square in London with no family attending.

Massie, Ethel Beatty was a poor mother, abandoning her son Ronald from her first marriage; she also left the children of her second marriage with her husband while she went on a gambling trip to Monte Carlo in 1912. Peter had birth complications that affected his eyesight and muscle control for the rest of his life, thought to originate from a venereal disease carried by Ethel It was \\"generally accepted\\" in later years that Peter was illegitimate, the father being a \\"well-known member of the British aristocracy\\", according to a Beatty family member. In her obituary, it was noted that \\"her beauty and personality made her one of England's foremost hostesses. She and her husband often entertained King Edward VII at shooting parties in Scotland.\\" While David Beatty benefited by Ethel's wealth, it was not a happy marriage, \\"I am the most unhappy man in the world\\", David once said, \\"I have paid terribly for my millions\\". The result of which was his decade-long love affair with Eugénie Godfrey-Faussett, wife of Captain Bryan Godfrey-Faussett. In 1919, David was raised to the peerage when he became the first Earl Beatty, making Ethel Countess Beatty. After a one month illness, Lady Beatty died in her sleep on 17 July 1932 at Dingley Hall in Dingley, Northamptonshire. Lord Beatty died in London on 12 March 1936, and was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son, David. Descendants Lady Beatty and her two younger sons, David and Peter.

Background Most pre-industrial economies had standards of living not much above subsistence, among that the majority of the population were focused on producing their means of survival. For example, in medieval Europe, as much as 80% of the labour force was employed in subsistence agriculture. Some pre-industrial economies, such as classical Athens, had trade and commerce as significant factors, so native Greeks could enjoy wealth far beyond a sustenance standard of living through the use of slavery.Akrigg, B. (2019). Population and Economy in Classical Athens (Cambridge Classical Studies). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/9781139225250, page 95 Famines were frequent in most pre- industrial societies, although some, such as the Netherlands and England of the 17th and 18th centuries, the Italian city states of the 15th century, the medieval Islamic Caliphate, and the ancient Greek and Roman civilisations were able to escape the famine cycle through increasing trade and commercialisation of the agricultural sector. It is estimated that during the 17th century, Netherlands imported nearly 70% of its grain supply; and in the 5th century BC Athens imported three-quarters of its total food supply. A process called proto-industrialisation occurred in Europe as well as in Mughal India, and was the first stage prior to the Industrial Revolution. In his 1728 work on the economy of England, A Plan of the English Commerce, Daniel Defoe describes how England developed from being a raw wool producer to the manufacture of finished woolen textiles. Defoe writes that Tudor monarchs, especially Henry VII of England and Elizabeth I, implemented policies that today would be described as protectionist, such as imposing high tariffs on the importation of finished woolen goods, imposing high taxes on raw wool exports leaving England, bringing in artisans skilled in wool textile manufacturing from the Low Countries, awarding selective government-granted monopoly rights in geographic areas of England deemed suitable for textile industrial production, and granting government-sponsored industrial espionage to develop the early English textile industry.Chang, Ha-Joon \\"Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism\\" (New York: Random House, 2008), p. 229 quoting \\"A Plan for the English Commerce, p. 95 After the victory of the East India Company in the Battle of Plassey over the rulers of the Bengal Subah, industrialisation through innovation in manufacturing processes first started with the Industrial Revolution in the north-west and Midlands of England in the 18th century.The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England by Steven Kreis.

Industrial revolution in Europe The Crystal Palace Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations, London, 1851. Early industrialisation in Germany, the city of Barmen in 1870. Painting by August von Wille Aplerbecker Hütte, an industrialised area of Dortmund, Germany circa 1910. The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to industrialise. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the UK experienced a massive increase in agricultural productivity known as the British Agricultural Revolution, which enabled an unprecedented population growth, freeing a significant percentage of the workforce from farming, and helping to drive the Industrial Revolution. Due to the limited amount of arable land and the overwhelming efficiency of mechanised farming, the increased population could not be dedicated to agriculture. New agricultural techniques allowed a single peasant to feed more workers than previously; however, these techniques also increased the demand for machines and other hardware, which had traditionally been provided by the urban artisans. Artisans, collectively called bourgeoisie, employed rural exodus workers to increase their output and meet the country's needs. British industrialisation involved significant changes in the way that work was performed. The process of creating a good was divided into simple tasks, each one of them being gradually mechanised in order to boost productivity and thus increase income. The new machines helped to improve the productivity of each worker. However, industrialisation also involved the exploitation of new forms of energy. In the pre-industrial economy, most machinery was powered by human muscle, by animals, by wood-burning or by water-power. With industrialisation these sources of fuel were replaced with coal, which could deliver significantly more energy than the alternatives. Much of the new technology that accompanied the industrial revolution was for machines which could be powered by coal. One outcome of this was an increase in the overall amount of energy consumed within the economy - a trend which has continued in all industrialised nations to the present day. The accumulation of capital allowed investments in the scientific conception and application of new technologies, enabling the industrialisation process to continue to evolve. The industrialisation process formed a class of industrial workers who had more money to spend than their agricultural cousins. They spent this on items such as tobacco and sugar, creating new mass markets that stimulated more investment as merchants sought to exploit them.Enslavement and industrialisation Robin Blackburn , BBC British History. Published: 18 December 2006 Accessed April 2008 The mechanisation of production spread to the countries surrounding England geographically in Europe such as France and to British settler colonies, helping to make those areas the wealthiest, and shaping what is now known as the Western world. Some economic historians argue that the possession of so-called 'exploitation colonies' eased the accumulation of capital to the countries that possessed them, speeding up their development. The consequence was that the subject country integrated a bigger economic system in a subaltern position, emulating the countryside, which demands manufactured goods and offers raw materials, while the colonial power stressed its urban posture, providing goods and importing food. A classical example of this mechanism is said to be the triangular trade, which involved England, southern United States and western Africa. Some have stressed the importance of natural or financial resources that Britain received from its many overseas colonies or that profits from the British slave trade between Africa and the Caribbean helped fuel industrial investment. With these arguments still find some favour with historians of the colonies, most historians of the British Industrial Revolution do not consider that colonial possessions formed a significant role in the country's industrialisation. Whilst not denying that Britain could profit from these arrangement, they believe that industrialisation would have proceeded with or without the colonies. Early industrialisation in other countries The textile factory Slovena built in 1891 in Žilina (Slovakia) - an example of a delayed industrialisation in Central Europe. Belgium was the first country to develop a proper industry in continental Europe and was the second in the world (after the United Kingdom). In Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Czechia, the Netherlands and Scandinavia industrialization started only in the 1840s. In Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia industrialization started after 1880 and in the Baltics, Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine and Russia industrialization started after 1890. After the Convention of Kanagawa issued by Commodore Matthew C. Perry forced Japan to open the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate to American trade, the Japanese government realised that drastic reforms were necessary to stave off Western influence. The Tokugawa shogunate abolished the feudal system. The government instituted military reforms to modernise the Japanese army and also constructed the base for industrialisation. In the 1870s, the Meiji government vigorously promoted technological and industrial development that eventually changed Japan to a powerful modern country. In a similar way, Russia which suffered during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. The Soviet Union's centrally controlled economy decided to invest a big part of its resources to enhance its industrial production and infrastructures to assure its survival, thus becoming a world superpower.Joseph Stalin and the industrialisation of the USSR Learning Curve website, The UK National Archives. Accessed April 2008 During the Cold war, the other Warsaw Pact countries, organised under the Comecon framework, followed the same developing scheme, albeit with a less emphasis on heavy industry. Southern European countries such as Spain or Italy industrialized moderately during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and then experienced economic booms after the Second World War, caused by a healthy integration of the European economy.BOOM E MIRACOLO ITALIANO ANNI '50-60 (CRONOLOGIA)Queer transitions in contemporary Spanish culture: from Franco to la movida, By Gema Pérez-Sánchez The Third World A similar state-led developing programme was pursued in virtually all the Third World countries during the Cold War, including the socialist ones, but especially in Sub-Saharan Africa after the decolonisation period. The primary scope of those projects was to achieve self-sufficiency through the local production of previously imported goods, the mechanisation of agriculture and the spread of education and health care. However, all those experiences failed bitterly due to a lack of realism: most countries did not have a pre-industrial bourgeoisie able to carry on a capitalistic development or even a stable and peaceful state. Those aborted experiences left huge debts toward western countries and fuelled public corruption. Petrol-producing countries Oil-rich countries saw similar failures in their economic choices. An EIA report stated that OPEC member nations were projected to earn a net amount of $1.251 trillion in 2008 from their oil exports.OPEC to earn $1.251 trillion from oil exports - EIA, Reutrs Because oil is both important and expensive, regions that had big reserves of oil had huge liquidity incomes. However, this was rarely followed by economic development. Experience shows that local elites were unable to re- invest the petrodollars obtained through oil export, and currency is wasted in luxury goods.Understanding New Middle East, Behzad Shahandeh, The Korea Times, 31 October 2007 This is particularly evident in the Persian Gulf states, where the per capita income is comparable to those of western nations, but where no industrialisation has started. Apart from two little countries (Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates), the Persian Gulf states have not diversified their economies, and no replacement for the upcoming end of oil reserves is envisaged.Background Note: Saudi Arabia Industrialisation in Asia Durgapur Steel Plant located in West Bengal, India Apart from Japan, where industrialisation began in the late 19th century, a different pattern of industrialisation followed in East Asia. One of the fastest rates of industrialisation occurred in the late 20th century across four places known as the Asian tigers (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan), thanks to the existence of stable governments and well structured societies, strategic locations, heavy foreign investments, a low cost skilled and motivated workforce, a competitive exchange rate, and low custom duties. In the case of South Korea, the largest of the four Asian tigers, a very fast-paced industrialisation took place as it quickly moved away from the manufacturing of value-added goods in the 1950s and 60s into the more advanced steel, shipbuilding and automotive industry in the 1970s and 80s, focusing on the high-tech and service industry in the 1990s and 2000s. As a result, South Korea became a major economic power. This starting model was afterwards successfully copied in other larger Eastern and Southern Asian countries. The success of this phenomenon led to a huge wave of offshoring – i.e., Western factories or Tertiary Sector corporations choosing to move their activities to countries where the workforce was less expensive and less collectively organised. China and India, while roughly following this development pattern, made adaptations in line with their own histories and cultures, their major size and importance in the world, and the geo-political ambitions of their governments, etc.. Meanwhile, India's government is investing in economic sectors such as bioengineering, nuclear technology, pharmaceutics, informatics, and technologically oriented higher education, exceeding its needs, with the goal of creating several specialisation poles able to conquer foreign markets. Both China and India have also started to make significant investments in other developing countries, making them significant players in today's world economy. Newly industrialised countries The countries in green are considered to be newly industrialising nations. China and India (in dark green) are special cases. Since the mid-late 20th century, most countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa, including Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, South Africa, and Turkey have experienced substantial industrial growth, fuelled by exporting to countries that have bigger economies: the United States, China, India and the EU. They are sometimes called newly industrialised countries. Despite this trend being artificially influenced by the oil price increases since 2003, the phenomenon is not entirely new nor totally speculative (for instance see: Maquiladora). Japan and Russia both were successful in the fact that they imitated many other societies giving them flexibility. Yet they both had very little in common before the 19th century. Japan was isolated from the world with its ongoing traditions and forms of centralised government. Russia featured a more strong centralised government under the emperor. Both would soon discover that westernisation and industrialism were expanding and their own ways would not hold up against the new changing world of industrialisation. In the late 19th century the requirement for them to begin industrialising would become even more prevalent for the success of their nation in this new, growing society.

Sir Weetman was nominated as President as well as being a founding director. The company was capitalised at £1,000,000. On 12 December 1990 the company name was changed to Pearson Management Services Ltd. The company formed part of what is now the Pearson PLC group of business interests. Aviation interests In 1929, Whitehall Securities became a financial investor of Airwork Services, a British private aviation conglomerate established by Nigel Norman and Alan Muntz the year before.The ATL-98 Carvair: A Comprehensive History of the Aircraft and All 21 Airframes (Part 1: Getting off the ground – Airwork), p. 14 In 1935, Viscount Cowdray's younger son, Bernard Clive Pearson, took over the management of Whitehall Securities. By that time, Whitehall Securities had acquired shareholdings in a number of Britain's leading pre-World War II private airlines. Among these was Spartan Air Lines that was formed as a subsidiary to Spartan Aircraft which had been acquired by Whitehall Securities. In 1931 Spartan Aircraft's operations were allied to the Saunders-Roe company in which Whitehall Securities had taken a majority shareholding. In April 1935, Whitehall Securities and Jersey Airways formed United Airways as a sister airline to Spartan Air Lines.Airways (The Archive: The Legacy of BOAC (Pt. 1)), p. 62 Whitehall Securities had acquired a controlling shareholding in Hillman's Airways, which had become a public company in December 1934 following the death of Hillman's founder Ted Hillman. In September 1935, Hillman's Airways, Spartan Air Lines and United Airways merged to form Allied British Airways. A month later, the new airline shortened its name to British Airways. On 1 August 1936, British Airways took over British Continental Airways, and the following month it absorbed Crilly Airways. Whitehall Securities was joined as investor in the merged airline by the French banking company Emile Erlanger & Co. Whitehall Securities' financial involvement with the pre-war British Airways came to an end following the merger of the airline with Imperial Airways to form British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) in 1940, which resulted in the industry's nationalisation. Meanwhile in Scotland, Whitehall Securities had purchased two other independent airlines, Northern & Scottish Airways and Highland Airways, and on 12 August 1937, merged them into a new company, Scottish Airways. This played an important role in World War Two, but the post-war nationalisation of independent airlines saw it merged into British European Airways in 1947. In the post-war era, Airwork changed its name to British United Airways (BUA) on 19 May 1960 following Whitehall Securities' agreement to let Airwork [re-]use the United Airways name together with the prefix British. (This preceded BUA's official formation on 1 July of that year, when Airwork merged with Hunting- Clan Air Transport.)Airwork: A History (Chapter 2: Company Development 1928–1960 – Formation of BUA), pp. 11/2 Whitehall Securities held 10% of the new group. Other holdings In 1951 Whitehall Securities Corporation purchased the Lawley Group, china manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers of china and glass, of London and Stoke-on-Trent. Whitehall Securities already owned Booths and Colcloughs together with a large number of ceramic and pottery manufacturers. This grouping became known as Allied English Potteries which was later absorbed into the Wedgwood group.

Modernisation refers to a model of a progressive transition from a 'pre-modern' or 'traditional' to a 'modern' society. The theory looks at the internal factors of a country while assuming that, with assistance, \\"traditional\\" countries can be brought to development in the same manner more developed countries have. Modernisation theory attempts to identify the social variables that contribute to social progress and development of societies, and seeks to explain the process of social evolution. Modernisation theory is subject to criticism originating among socialist and free-market ideologies, world-systems theorists, globalisation theorists and dependency theorists among others. Modernisation theory not only stresses the process of change, but also the responses to that change. It also looks at internal dynamics while referring to social and cultural structures and the adaptation of new technologies.  Earliest expressions of the theory  Émile Durkheim The basic principles of Modernisation theory can be derived from the Idea of Progress, which emerged in the 18th century Age of Enlightenment with the idea that people themselves could develop and change their society. The French philosopher Marquis de Condorcet was involved in the origins of the theory with the idea that technological advancements and economic changes can enable changes in moral and cultural values. Condorcet was the first to make the connection between economic and social development and to suggest that there can be continuous progress and improvement in human affairs. The logic of this view implies that new processes and improvements are continually needed to keep pace with a constantly changing world. Furthermore, Condorcet advocated technological advancement as a means of giving people further control over their environments, arguing that technological progress would eventually spur social progress. In addition to social structure and the evolution of societies, the French sociologist Émile Durkheim developed the concept of functionalism, which stresses the interdependence of the institutions of a society and their interaction in maintaining cultural and social unity. His most famous work is The Division of Labour in Society, which described mechanisms for the maintenance of social order and the ways in which primitive societies might make the transition to becoming more economically advanced industrial societies. Durkheim suggested that in a capitalist society, with a complex division of labour, economic regulation would be needed to maintain order. He stressed that the major transition from a primitive social order to a more advanced industrial society could otherwise bring crisis and disorder. Durkheim furthermore developed the idea of social evolution, which was coined by Herbert Spencer, which indicates how societies and cultures develop over time; for Durkheim, social evolution is like biological evolution with reference to the development of its components. As with living organisms and species, societies progress through several stages, generally beginning at a simple level and developing toward a more complex level of organisation. Societies adapt to surrounding environments, but also interact with other societies, which further contributes to progress and development. Modern sociology evolved in part as a reaction to the problems associated with modernity, such as industrialisation and the process of 'rationalisation'. Modernisation theory emerged further in the late 19th century and was especially popular among scholars in the mid-20th century. One notable advocate was Harvard sociologist Talcott Parsons whose Mandarins of the Future (2003) stressed the importance of societies remaining open to change and saw reactionary forces as restricting development. Maintaining tradition for tradition's sake was thought to be harmful to progress and development.Khan, p. 162–164. Proponents of modernisation tend to fall into two camps, optimists and pessimists. The former view holds that what some see as a setback for the theory (events such as the Iranian Revolution or the persistence of instability in the Democratic Republic of Congo) are invariably temporary setbacks Brugger and Hannan, p. 43. on the road to progress. Pessimists argue that certain 'non-modern' areas of the world are incapable of becoming modern.Macionis, p. 953. The eminent sociologist Max Weber also made important contributions to development theory. Weber's concept of \\"rationalisation\\" was mobilised by those who held that the most important factor behind modernisation was the growth of rationality as a core value. Normally rationality denotes the universally available logic underpinning thought and deliberation in a particular society. Most theorists consider it indispensable for the modernisation process. Rationality allows people to think in new and innovative ways; innovation is thus coeval with modernisation.  Contributors  Among the academics who contributed much to this theory are W. W. Rostow, who in his The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto (1960) concentrates on the economic system side of the modernisation, trying to show factors needed for a country to reach the path to modernisation in his Rostovian take-off model. David Apter concentrated on the political system and history of democracy, researching the connection between democracy, good governance and efficiency and modernisation. Seymour Martin Lipset in \\"Some Social Requisites of Democracy\\" (1959) argued that economic development sets off a series of profound social changes that together tend to produce democracy. David McClelland (The Achieving Society, 1967) approached this subject from the psychological perspective, with his motivations theory, arguing that modernisation cannot happen until a given society values innovation, striving for improvement and entrepreneurship. Alex Inkeles (Becoming Modern, 1974) similarly creates a model of modern personality, which needs to be independent, active, interested in public policies and cultural matters, open for new experiences, rational and being able to create long-term plans for the future. Edward Said's Orientalism (1978) interprets modernisation from the point of view of societies that are quickly and radically transformed.  Case studies  United States John Gast called American Progress, is an allegorical representation of the modernisation of the new west. Here Columbia, a personification of the United States, leads civilisation westward with American settlers, stringing telegraph wire as she sweeps west; she holds a school book. The different stages of economic activity of the pioneers are highlighted and, especially, the changing forms of transportation. The Native Americans and wild animals flee. The Progressives in the United States in the early 20th century were avid modernisers. They believed in science, technology, expertise—and especially education—as the grand solution to society's weaknesses. Characteristics of progressivism included a favorable attitude toward urban-industrial society, belief in mankind's ability to improve the environment and conditions of life, belief in obligation to intervene in economic and social affairs, and a belief in the ability of experts and in efficiency of government intervention.John D. Buenker, and KABASO.S.MUYA. Progressivism (1986); Maureen Flanagan, America Reformed: Progressives and Progressivisms, 1890s-1920s (2007); Modernisation theory exerts a \\"powerful influence\\" on historians dealing with the 1896-1916 era, asserts Martin J. Sklar, The United States as a developing country (1992) p. 54 Paul Monroe, a professor of history at Columbia University, was a member of The Inquiry—a team of American experts at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. He drew on his experience in the Philippines to assess the educational needs of developing areas such as Albania, Turkey and central Africa. Presenting educational development as instrumental to nation-building and socioeconomic development, Monroe recommended the implementation of a progressive curriculum - with an emphasis on practical, adult, and teacher training - in a national system of education, as a basis for self-development, except in Africa. His approach shaped American cooperation with developing countries in the 1920s and modernisation efforts during the 1920s-1930s.David M. Ment, \\"Education, nation‐building and modernisation after World War I: American ideas for the Peace Conference,\\" Paedagogica Historica, Feb 2005, Vol. 41 Issue 1/2, pp 159-177 Germany's \\"Sonderweg\\" Kocka (1988) and Sheri Berman are historians who emphasise the central importance of a German Sonderweg (\\"special path\\") or \\"exceptionalism\\" as the root of Nazism and the German catastrophe in the 20th century. Fritz Fischer and his students emphasised Germany’s primary guilt for causing World War I. Hans-Ulrich Wehler, a leader of the Bielefeld School of social history, places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s-1870s, when economic modernisation took place, but political modernisation did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service. Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernising society. Recognising the importance of modernising forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations (Klassenhabitus). The catastrophic German politics between 1914 and 1945 are interpreted in terms of a delayed modernisation of its political structures. At the core of Wehler's interpretation is his treatment of \\"the middle class\\" and \\"revolution,\\" each of which was instrumental in shaping the 20th century. Wehler's examination of Nazi rule is shaped by his concept of \\"charismatic domination,\\" which focuses heavily on Adolf Hitler.Wehler, Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte: Vom Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges bis zur Gründung der Beiden Deutschen Staaten 1914-1949 (2003) is the fourth volume of his monumental history of German society. None of the series has yet been translated into English. A partial summary appears in Hans-Ulrich Wehler, The German Empire, 1871-1918 (1997) The historiographical concept of a German Sonderweg has had a turbulent history. Scholars of the 19th century who emphasised a separate German path to modernity saw it as a positive factor that differentiated Germany from the \\"western path\\" typified by Great Britain. The stressed the strong bureaucratic state, reforms initiated by Bismarck and other strong leaders, the Prussian service ethos, the high culture of philosophy and music, and Germany's pioneering of a social welfare state. In the 1950s, historians in West Germany argued that the Sonderweg led Germany to the disaster of 1933-1945. The special circumstances of German historical structures and experiences, were interpreted as preconditions that, while not directly causing National Socialism, did hamper the development of a liberal democracy and facilitate the rise of fascism. The Sonderweg paradigm has provided the impetus for at least three strands of research in German historiography: the long 19th century, the history of the bourgeoisie, and comparisons with the West. After 1990, increased attention to cultural dimensions and to comparative and relational history moved German historiography to different topics, with much less attention paid to the Sonderweg. While some historians have abandoned the Sonderweg thesis, they have not provided a generally accepted alternative interpretation.Helmut Walser Smith, \\"When the Sonderweg Debate Left Us ,\\" German Studies Review,on May 2008, Vol. 31#2 pp 225-240 19th-century France In his seminal book Peasants Into Frenchmen: The Modernisation of Rural France, 1880–1914 (1976), historian Eugen Weber traced the modernisation of French villages and argued that rural France went from backward and isolated to modern and possessing a sense of French nationhood during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Joseph A. Amato, \\"Eugen Weber's France\\" Journal of Social History, Volume 25, 1992 pp 879–882. He emphasised the roles of railroads, republican schools, and universal military conscription. He based his findings on school records, migration patterns, military service documents and economic trends. Weber argued that until 1900 or so a sense of French nationhood was weak in the provinces. Weber then looked at how the policies of the Third Republic created a sense of French nationality in rural areas.Eugen Weber, \\"The Second Republic, Politics, and the Peasant,\\" French Historical Studies Vol. 11, No. 4 (Autumn, 1980), pp. 521-550 in JSTOR The book was widely praised, but was criticised by someTed W. Margadant, \\"French Rural Society in the Nineteenth Century: A Review Essay,\\" Agricultural History, Summer 1979, Vol. 53 Issue 3, pp 644-651 who argued that a sense of Frenchness existed in the provinces before 1870. =Greece= The modernising force of the post-civil war Greek society came primarily as a result of the European and US geopolitical strategy for the region of eastern Mediterranean. Greece ought to be a modern capitalistic state to counter the proximity of several eastern and third world bloc countries and the strong national communist movement. According to Truman doctrine and with the support of local elites, a great economical leap forward took place along with the severe repression that led to the 1967 coup d'état.Theodore A. Couloumbis, Greece in the Twentieth CenturyKostis Moskof, Isagogika shri istovia ton kinimatos tis evgatis taxis This dramatic change covered the long-standing cultural divide of greek academia, comparing modern and neo-greek to ancient and traditional identities. Music, art and cinema, influenced by the pioneers of American and European tendencies thrived,Lydia Papadimitriou and Yannis Tzioumakis, Greek Cinema until the milestone of 1967, in contrast to the authoritarian and traditionalist military and paramilitary structures. This dimension is vital as it reveals the process of modernisation under the western directives in all social levels that came in fact in opposition to the political directives of the same source.A. Papachelas, The rape of greek democracy: The American Factor, 1947-1967 Asia Many studies of modernisation have focused on the history of Japan in the late 19th century,Shuzo Teruoka, ed. Agriculture in the Modernization of Japan, 1850-2000 (2008); Cyril Black, The Modernization of Japan and Russia (1975) and China and India in the late 20th century.Russell H. Jeffries, China's Agricultural Modernization (2009); June Grasso, Jay Cornin, and Michael Kort, Modernization and Revolution in China: From the Opium Wars to the Olympics (2009) For example, the process of borrowing science and technology from the West has been explored. =China= Modernisation theory failed to explain the experience of China. Mao modernised the People's Republic of China with massive industrialisation projects and social transformation. However, China did not become a democratic country after its modernisation. Nowadays, even though the Soviet-style authoritarian regimes have already collapsed worldwide, China did not have any major political reforms after Mao's death. The country remained authoritarian, despite the size of its economic sector. China has been attempting to modernise ever since the Revolution of 1911 and the end of the Qing Dynasty, the last dynasty of China. Before the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, it attempted to reform from 1902 to 1908 to save itself and instigated reforms in infrastructure, transportation, and government. These reforms were based on Western models and even included aspects of democracy, which are often associated with the process of modernisation. However, these reforms were largely unsuccessful and resulted in the Revolution of 1911. Following the Revolution of 1911, other movements such as the May 4th Movement of 1919 advocated for modernisation, iconoclasm, and a rejection of foreign influence and imperialism. From the beginning of the 20th century until the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, China has been delayed in efforts to modernise due to an era of warlordism, the Second Sino-Japanese War, and civil war between the CCP and KMT. When the communist party came to power in 1949, Mao Zedong used the Soviet Union as China’s example for modernisation. The Great Leap Forward from 1958-1961 was Mao’s version of the Soviet Union’s Five year Plan, and its goals were to create a modern communist society through industrialisation and collectivisation. Mao Zedong aimed to become a world power without foreign, mainly western, involvement, ideas, or capitalism and preached the idea of self-reliance. Mao did contribute to the modernisation of China, however The Great Leap Forward is regarded as a failure and the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976 was detrimental to China's industrialisation progress. The Modern Chinese City of Shanghai However, during Mao's era, he transformed China from a predominantly agrarian country to an industrialised power. In the 1970s, China was able to produce most of commodities and goods by its own industry. Mao laid the foundation for China's economic development in Deng's era. The economic reforms of Chinese Supreme Leader Deng Xiaoping are attributed to China’s economic success in the 21st century. Deng focused on four modernisations: agriculture, industry, national defense, and science and technology. The West was used as an example for several of these modernisations, however their management was completely Chinese. Deng began de-collectivisation and allowed Township and Village Enterprises (TVE), Special Economic Zones (SEZ), foreign investment, profit incentive, and even privatisation. While Mao advocated self-reliance, Deng generated foreign exchange to finance modernisation. His famous quote is, \\"It doesn’t matter whether a cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice.\\" Post Deng Reforms continued on this path, which is acknowledged as a shift from the iron rice bowl to the porcelain rice bowl, or government owned to privatised. Although China’s economy has shifted towards privatisation and capitalism, the PRC remains an authoritative regime, which is contradictory in comparison to other examples of countries that have modernised. Democracy is the political characteristic that has defined modernised nations in the past and the modernisation theory suggests democracy follows with the development of a modernised state. China was late in modernisation and has thus had many other countries as examples to base its model of modernisation off of. The One-Child Policy has also been a technique to contribute or even force the modernisation of China. Instigated in 1978, the one-child policy has created a generation known as \\"singletons\\" or \\"little emperors\\" (xiao huangdi 小皇帝). \\"The Chinese state enforced a rapid fertility transition designed to cultivate a generation of \\"high-quality\\" people with resources and ambition to join the global elite.\\" These little emperors are expected to compete with the first-world countries having no siblings to compete with for parental investment. Normally with modernisation and urbanisation smaller or nuclear families evolve as the result. China has switched this logic, hoping that creating the culture of the nuclear family with the one-child policy it will produce modernisation. At the beginning of the 21st century, China is still in the process of modernisation. In 2010 it had the third greatest GDP and GDP (PPP) in the world with the world’s largest labour force, and is acknowledged as the world’s second largest economy. In 2010 its economy was still increasing in growth at 10.3%. China has also successfully joined the largely Western international arena with its membership of the UN in 1971, the WTO in 2001, and hosted the Olympics in 2008. China’s goal is to continue modernising until it joins the first-world and becomes the core instead of the semi-periphery or periphery, from the core-periphery model. The modernisation of China through urbanisation, industrialisation, and economic policy has benefited the country economically as it rises as a world power in the 21st century. However it now is experiencing the problems associated the other modern countries and capitalism. These problems include the growing disparity between the rich and poor, urban vs. rural and migration, and ecological issues. =South Korea= Modernisers in South Korea in the late 19th century were torn between the American and the Japanese models. Most of the Koreans involved were educated Christians who saw America as their ideal model of civilisation. However, most used Japan as a practical model - as an example of how a fellow East Asian country, which 30 years before was also backward, could succeed in modernising itself. At the same time, reformists' nationalist reaction against the domineering, colonial behaviour of the Japanese in Korea often took the form of an appeal to international (Western) standards of civilisation. The Western-oriented worldview of the early Christian nationalist reformers was complex, multilayered, and often self-contradictory - with 'oppressive' features not easily distinguishable from 'liberational' ones. Their idealised image of the West as the only true, ideal civilisation relegated much of Korea's traditional culture to a position of 'oriental'. The self-image of Koreans was formed through complex relationships with modernity, colonialism, Christianity, and nationalism. This formation was initiated by a change in the notion of 'civilisation' due to the transformation of 'international society' and thereafter was affected by the trauma of Japanese colonisation. Through the process of transition from a traditional Confucian notion of civilisation to a Western notion of acceptance and resistance, Koreans shaped their civilisation as well as their notions of the racial, cultural, and individual modern self. Western Orientalism, in particular, accompanied the introduction of the Western notion of civilisation, which served as the background for forming the self-identity of Koreans. The fact that the Japanese version of Orientalism emerged from the domination of Korea by Japan played a critical role in shaping the self-identity of Koreans. Consequently, Korea still maintains an inferiority complex toward Western culture, ambivalent feelings toward Japanese culture, and biased - positive or negative - views of their own cultural traditions. Thus both modernisation and colonisation have shaped the formation or distortion of self-consciousness of non-Western peoples. The US launched a decades-long intensive development starting in 1945 to modernise South Korea, with the goal of helping it become a model nation-state and an economic success. Agents of modernisation at work in Korea included the US Army, the Economic Cooperation Administration, the UN Korean Reconstruction Agency, and a number of nongovernmental organisations, among them the Presbyterian Church, the YMCA, Boy Scouts and the Ford Foundation. Many Koreans migrated to California and Hawaii, and brought back firsthand accounts of modern business and governmental practices that they sought to adapt to Korean conditions. =Japan= Modernisation theory was generally supported by American scholars and opposed by Japanese Marxists.* Garon, Sheldon. \\"Rethinking Modernization and Modernity in Japanese History: A Focus on State- Society Relations\\" Journal of Asian Studies 53#2 (1994), pp. 346-366 online After industrialisation and economic modernisation, a democratic society did appear in Japan, but was followed in the 1930s by an aggressive authoritarian fascist state, up until the Allied Forces defeated Japan in the Second World War. It then became democratic again and has remained so. There were almost no democratic principles or practices in pre-war Japanese politics. Prior to the liberation of Japan by the United States from its military government, Japanese culture always honoured obedience and hierarchy, and Japanese people also despised individualism and liberty. Japan had already modernised and became an industrialised country during its Meiji period, which happened long before Japan's defeat in the Second World War. Japan was the first country in Asia that industrialised successfully. It quickly became one of the imperialist and colonial powers. Japan defeated the Qing dynasty of China in 1894, and subsequently defeated Russia in 1905. Korea and Taiwan were annexed by the Japanese Empire. When Japan invaded China in 1931, it had already finished its industrialising process and had enough industrial power to wage a war itself. Japan's navy was among the world's most advanced navies. The democratic performance of Japan after the Second War was promoted by the U.S. and welcomed by a great majority. Japan quickly went through a lot of changes concerning modernisation after their defeat. This happened starting with United States quickly intervening with Japan internally. American demilitarisation and democratisation was accepted by the people of Japan without strong resistance. Under the occupation of United States, SCAP (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers) was established, which was an institution in charge of formulating policies. The goal of SCAP was to dissolve the army and navy, and also to punish responsible leaders, and it established the New constitution of 1946. SCAP could not function without the assistance of Japanese government because the language barrier was too high. However, this actually helped make bigger changes in creating demilitarisation and democratisation. SCAP helped people to gain freedoms of speech, press, and the right to organise labour or farmer unions. As such, the new constitution created by SCAP granted civil and political rights to the people; consequently, leading to modernisation. It also allowed freedom of speech and association, right to organise labour association and movements, or create unions; and implemented grounds for civil rights for women. The government also held an important role in modernising Japan. Japan concentrated on their industry and technology to achieve growth. For that, the state gave assistances to several industries and adopted protectionism policies. Government stepped in as lender, as facilitator of access to foreign exchange, raw materials, or technology licenses, and as rescuer when problems arise. To illustrate, the most important guiding agency was the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. In addition, through the 1960s, Japanese government used economic policies such as tariffs to obstruct imports and protect Japanese firms from foreign competitors in its domestic market in order to become a modernised country. =Turkey= Turkey, under Kemal Atatürk in the 1920s and 1930s, engaged in a systematic modernisation programme called \\"Kemalism\\". Hundreds of European scholars came to help. Together with Turkish intellectuals they developed a successful model of development.Craig C. Hansen, \\"Are We Doing Theory Ethnocentrically? A Comparison of Modernization Theory and Kemalism,\\" Journal of Developing Societies (0169796X), 1989, Vol. 5 Issue 2, pp 175-187Murat Ergin, \\"Cultural encounters in the social sciences and humanities: western émigré scholars in Turkey,\\" History of the Human Sciences, Feb 2009, Vol. 22 Issue 1, pp 105-130Arnold Reisman, Turkey's Modernization: Refugees from Nazism and Atatürk's Vision (2006)Robert Ward and Dankwart Rustow, eds. Political Modernization in Japan and Turkey (1964). Latin America Since independence, modernisation has been a driving force for Chile's political elites. Ree (2007) analyses projects of modernisation that have been implemented from above since 1964. Despite their ideological differences and very different understandings of what modernity is, these projects shared key characteristics in their construction and implementation, such as the use of developmental theories, their state-orientation, the prominent role of technocrats and state-planning, and the capacity of adaptation in sight of civil unrest. These projects have produced patterns of modernity that have proven particularly stable. Africa Modernisation has been attributed with creating positive development around the world, but in Modern times its ability to promote development, specifically in Africa, has been less than so. Modernisation that has taken place in Africa can be described as something that has yet to benefit most of the African countries. Modernisation through development has led to problems in Nigeria by bringing in private, foreign owned oil companies that have been exploiting the natural resource wealth of the country. Because the oil companies are generally owned by a different nation, the profits are mostly being exported from Nigeria with only one fifteenth of the wealth produced in the region returning to it. Shell, the oil company operating in Ogoniland, Nigeria has helped the country develop and industrialise on a small scale, but it has primarily challenged the sovereignty and autonomy of Nigeria. A lot of scholars view modernisation as a sort of westernisation where western institutions such as national parks and industries are brought into existing cultures where their use does not make as much sense. Along with modernisation comes a loss of culture and society, and the individual is strengthened. An African tribe known as the Ik was forced to change their habits due to modernisation and the creation of individual countries caused by colonialism. Nationalisation, as a tool of modernisation, was imparted on Africa by colonialists who wanted to westernise and modernise tribal Africa. The creation of individual countries made life for the tribal Ik more difficult because they were forced out of their nomadic lifestyle into a settlement based around a newly founded national park that practically destroyed their livelihood by restricting their hunting grounds to specific non-park areas. The creation of national parks have increased cultivation, which can be seen as good development because people no longer depend solely on livestock. This creation of a new sort of livelihood has mixed improvements, because the tribal setting is not removed, but is put into a single place.

King was the third son of Robert King, 2nd Earl of Kingston and the younger brother of George King, 3rd Earl of Kingston and Robert King, 1st Viscount Lorton. He was educated at Eton from 1781 to 1788 and at Harrow in 1789. He entered the Royal Navy and was commissioned a lieutenant on 12 June 1796. From May to August 1801, he commanded the brig-sloop Charger. King's family was one of several with electoral interests in County Roscommon. In 1799, their rivals, the pro-Unionist Mahons, had used his brother Robert's anti-Union stance to obtain the Lord Lieutenant's backing against him and take the Roscommon seat in the Parliament of Ireland at a by-election for Lt.-Col. Thomas Mahon, eldest son of the family. After the Union, the administration wished to remain on good terms with the Kings; they declined to support Mahon, and Edward was returned at the 1802 election without a contest. He was promoted commander on 29 April 1802, and commanded the ship-sloop Argus from June 1803 until becoming post-captain on 8 May 1804. In 1805, he took command of the sixth- rate Ariadne. He had recently returned to Ariadne, on blockading duty off of Gravelines, when the Dutch flotilla joining the proposed invasion of England broke out of Dunkirk on 17 July 1805, making for Boulogne. Ariadne and her consorts drove three or four of the thirty-two gun-vessels ashore, but they were badly outgunned by the shore forts and the four prams accompanying the gun-vessels. The Ariadnes squadron was joined early in the morning of the 18th by the frigate Vestal, which had heard the firing, and they renewed the attack on the flotilla off Calais, without notable results. Early in 1806, King was appointed to command the frigate Alexandria. His elder brothers put him forward again that year as a candidate for Roscommon, although he was away at sea escorting convoys. The Mahon interest had revived, and Lord Hartland put up his second son, Col. Stephen Mahon, as a candidate. Mahon's interest proved too strong, and King withdrew from the contest without a poll. King died on 25 September 1807 at a naval hospital in St Ann's, Barbados, and was buried at St Michael's.

The term describes a local music genre with strange dance style, exaggerated dress or imitates Korean and Japanese pop music. Inasmuch as MK pop singers have specific Mong Kok culture characteristics, including drawing black eyeliner, applying nail polish and putting on heavy makeup, people call them MK. Apart from their exaggerated appearances, their dance moves are said to be weird and new-fashioned. Due to wide media coverage and Internet forum discussions, a hot debate over the degree of social acceptance of Mk Pop is caused. Background In recent years, there has been a growing popularity in Korean pop culture. Korean boy bands and girl groups, such as Super Junior, Girls' Generation and Big Bang, are acclaimed as pretty and handsome singers with slick dance routines and catchy tunes. With the rise of world tour and social media, like YouTube and Twitter, K-pop has broken into Hong Kong market and captured the minds and hearts of Hongkongers. The recession of Hong Kong music industry is one of the main reasons that the Hong Kong people prefer pop music culture of foreign countries, rather than local music culture. There were not many stimulations and new elements of Canto-pop in the past few years, though there were some fresh boy groups were introduced in the public eye in the early 2014. With the prevalence of K-pop, they are imitating Korean pop singers' overstated makeup. In addition to their appearances, their music style and performance are also highly similar to that of Korean boy groups. Apparently, MK Pop has now become a special icon in Hong Kong music industry. Examples of MK Pop singers Bird of Paradise (BOP) It is a dancing and singing boy group of Pan Asia Cultural Company, which debuted officially in March, 2014. There are three members in the group, who are Gordon, Lincoln and Tyree. Their average age is 22 years old. The group name \\"Bird of Paradise\\" is a florid, which means a kind, brave, courageous and pretty boy with dreams. Their debuted song \\"登陸太陽\\" has accumulated about 200,000 hit rates on YouTube. Most people comment that their eyeliner and heavy makeup are the peculiarities that arouse social attention. Faith It is a boy group which debuted in March, 2014. Three members are included in the group – Hiu Yong, Wave and Sky. All members in Faith are post-1990s. When their debut \\"Stop Peeping\\" released, 900,000 hit rates were attained. Their second song \\"Ma Ma Easy\\" also accumulated about 800,000 YouTube viewers. As there is a prevailing trend of K-pop in Hong Kong, they claim that they prone to take the style of K-pop stars as a reference and it is hoped that the general public can accept such a new element in Hong Kong music industry. TENMUXIC It is a Guangzhou singing boy group developed in 2009. There are two members in TENMUXIC, who are Parkson and Leandro. In March, 2014, they released a new song called \\"Kiss Kiss Kiss\\" on YouTube, which drew much attention from Internet users. Given that their style resembles that of K-pop, people therefore prone to comprise it into the category of \\"MK Pop\\". Social Debates Pros =A Stimulation of Hong Kong Music Industry= It is said that the arise of MK Pop groups stimulates the local industry. Starting from the 2000s, Hong Kong music industry has been described as plain and uncreative. Many local music producers stick only to the 1980s-style songs. There is a continuous release of similar melody and highly repetitive music form in the market. As Wyman Wong, local lyricist, pointed out \\"Let alone their [MK Pop groups] unorthodox dance moves and melodies, their debuts introduce locals a new song genre\\", the popularity of MK Pop can in turn encourage musicians to bring in more new genres to the society. Cons =A Business Strategy= The rise of MK Pop groups is one of the business strategies to maximize local entertainment companies' profit. Companies exploit 'Fast-food Culture' in Hong Kong, using unorthodox dance and music to create a fad(Ip, 2014). \\"The industry is profit-oriented. It puts little emphasis on long-term planning and training. MK Pop is not firm enough to last long\\" (Fei, 2014). For some companies, the intention of setting MK Pop groups is to have short-term return, but not developing a new genre. =Limitations of MK Pop Groups= First, the groups are too new to gain more sponsorships and gather more supporters. Second, MK Pop artists are being compared with Korean pop groups, in which their dancing proficiency is always criticized by others. Third, their budgets for styling and production are relatively tighter than other mainstream singers, which limit their development. Lastly, since MK Pop songs' contents are packed mainly with strong beats, it is believed that it is not easy for them to stand out from other songs. \\"These groups may need to instill more local collective memories to stand out\\" (Wong, 2014).

A unique 'spider bearing' is used to connect all six connecting rods to the crankpin, rather than the traditional master connecting rod used in radial engines. Steam is exhausted through the piston tops into the crankcase. Steam admission is through a valve in each cylinder head. The Cyclone Waste Heat Engine (WHE) is a small steam engine developed to produce power from steam created from waste heat. It is an offshoot of the development of the Cyclone Mark V Engine by the company Cyclone Power Technologies of Pampano Beach, Florida. The original versions were designed by inventor Harry Schoell, founder of Cyclone Power Technologies and the later versions have been designed by the Ohio State University Center for Automotive Research (OSU-CAR).

Engine construction and operation The Cyclone Waste Heat Engine (WHE) is a single-acting, Uniflow steam engine. The two main variations are the WHE-25, a six-cylinder radial engine that was under development until November 2013, and the 3-cylinder WHE-DR that has been under development since.Press release \\"Cyclone Power Technologies completes build of next generation waste heat engine with The Ohio State University's Center for Automotive Research\\", November 5, 2013.

Retrieved from http://www.engineeringtv.com/video/Cyclone-Waste-Heat-Engine but it is not known if any working engines were built in this configuration. Operation Operation of the piston reed valve The timing on the admission valve(s) is arranged so that no matter what position the engine is in when it stopped last, the valve to at least one cylinder will always be open. This allows the engine to start by itself whenever steam is supplied to it, without other means such as an electric starter motor to cause the engine to initially rotate. The fraction of the stroke in which the admission valve is open on a steam engine is termed the cutoff. On the WHE-25 it is 34% of the stroke.Cyclone Waste Heat Engine Specification Sheet. Retrieved from From top dead center to 34% of stroke, the crank turns through an angle of about 71°. In the six cylinder engine, one piston reaches top dead center every 360°/6 = 60°. The three cylinder WHE-DR engine only has a piston reach TDC every 120°, so its admission valve must be open over a much larger angle to ensure the engine is self-starting. If the valve is open for 130° of crankshaft rotation, the cutoff value would be about 64%. The expansion stroke of the steam engine covers piston travel from top dead center to bottom dead center. When the piston reverses to return to top dead center, an exhaust valve needs to open so that the expanded steam from the previous stroke can be released from the cylinder. The WHE engine has an exhaust valve in each piston actuated by a protrusion on the connecting rod (see figure to right). On the exhaust stroke the angle of the connecting rod causes it to open the piston valve, allowing expanded steam to exhaust into the crankcase. The WHE-25 design used a reed valve, which is a piece of thin metal covering the top of the piston (as shown in the figure). The WHE-DR design replaced the reed with a ball resting in a valve seat in the piston crown. 'Spider bearing' The WHE-25 is designed with six connecting rods sharing one crankpin on the crankshaft. The standard design for such connection is with a master connecting rod connected to one piston and the remaining rods connected to pins in the big end of the master rod. Harry Schoell, inventor of the WHE, also invented what he called a 'spider bearing',US Patent 7900454, \\"Connecting rod journals and crankshaft spider bearing in an engine\\". Retrieved from http://www.google.com/patents/US7900454 which is a disk that can rotate around the crankpin, and has one bearing journal around its periphery for each of the six connecting rods. While this design eliminates the need for a separate master rod, it introduces one uncontrolled degree of freedom, i.e., the spider bearing itself can rotate in one direction until its motion is stopped by impacting with the connecting rods, then rotate in the other direction through some angle before it is stopped by again impacting connecting rods. The WHE-DR design eliminated the spider bearing by having each cylinder offset from the others longitudinally so that the connecting rod big ends can fit on a shared crankpin side by side. It has been reported that \\"Initial testing has demonstrated significantly smoother and quieter operation.\\" Elimination of the spider bearing was the only design change that would have led to this improvement. Water lubrication The Waste Heat Engine's design requires the use of water to lubricate the moving parts because exhaust steam goes into the engine crankcase. Any oil used to lubricate crankshaft and connecting rod bearings would soon form an emulsion of oil and water that would have very poor lubricating properties. Journal bearings on the crankshaft and connecting rods and the pistons sliding in their cylinders operate in the hydrodynamic lubrication regime. The carrying capacity of a journal bearing is a direct function of the dynamic viscosity of the lubricating fluid. Water at 20 °C has a viscosity of 0.001002 Pa·s, while a typical motor oil could have a viscosity of about 0.250 Pa·s. Thus, water is about 250 times less effective of a lubricant than oil.

Efficiency Schematic indicator diagram of pressure in a steam engine cylinder. The pressure in the cylinder declines after cutoff as the steam pushes the piston down its bore. No independent tests of any WHE model have been reported, but an indication comes from information published regarding the test waste heat recovery system for Bent Glass Design of Hatboro, PA.Press release \\"Bent Glass Design Purchases Engine System From Cyclone Power Technologies\\" Retrieved from http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/Bent-Glass-Design-Purchases-Engine- System-From-Cyclone-Power-Technologies-921147.htm The system was described as providing up to 10 kW electrical output using a WHE-25 model engine and \\"will convert over 500,000 BTUs of exhaust heat from the customer's glass manufacturing furnaces into electric power.\\" A heat flow rate 500,000 BTU/hr equals 146.5 kW. \\\\text{Efficiency}={\\\\text{power out} \\\\over\\\\text{power in}}= {10 kW \\\\over 146.5 kW} = 6.8\\\\% The WHE-25 engine has a 34% cutoff. This allows for the remaining 66% of the piston stroke to expand the steam, extracting work from it and causing the pressure to drop. The figure to the right shows how pressure in the cylinder of a steam engine drops after the cutoff point. The WHE-DR must have a much later cutoff to allow it to self-start. The later cutoff leads to a larger mean effective pressure that will give a larger power output for an engine of a given size operating at a given speed, but also leads to a decrease in efficiency since steam is at a higher pressure when exhausted from the cylinder and less of its energy has been converted to mechanical work. Auxiliary equipment Physical layout of the four main devices used in the Rankine cycle Expander: A steam engine is just one component in a Rankine cycle power system. The figure of the Rankine cycle at the right shows a turbine rather than a reciprocating piston engine between states 3 and 4, but either device acts as the expander stage in the cycle. Condenser: The device between states 4 and 1 is the condenser. It removes heat from the engine exhaust steam to condense it back into water. In the case of the WHE-25 engine in the previous sub-section, of the 146.5 kW of heat energy supplied in the initial steam, 10 kW was converted into electricity. That leaves 146.5 - 10 = 136.5 kW of heat energy to be removed by the condenser. As a point of comparison, a Caterpillar C13 diesel engine that is commonly used in tractor-trailer trucks has a heat rejection to coolant rating of 128 kW.Caterpillar C13 diesel engine generator set specification sheet. Retrieved from Thus, a condenser for the WHE-25 engine producing 10 kW of power would be about the size of the radiator on a semi-truck. The newer WHE-DR is likely less efficient, so would need an even bigger condenser for the same output power. The condenser requires enough airflow to take away the heat. A fan is usually used to create this airflow, and its power consumption reduces the net power available from the system. Feed water pump: The condensed water is stored in a tank, then pumped to high pressure by the feed water pump, states 1 to 2 in the figure. This pump requires a source of power, as well as a control system so that it pumps the proper amount of water to compensate for the amount of steam put into the engine. Boiler: Heat is added to the water in the boiler to create the steam, states 2 to 3 in the figure. Boilers are sometimes called steam generators, and Cyclone Power Technologies has used the term \\"Combustion Chamber/Heat Exchanger\\" or \\"CCHX\\".Press release \\"Cyclone Power Technologies and Phoenix Power Group Successfully Integrate Waste Oil Co-Generation System\\". Retrieved from http://www.marketwired.com/press- release/cyclone-power-technologies-phoenix-power-group-successfully-integrate- waste-oil-co-generation-otcqb-cypw-1706457.htm Regardless of the name used, if the system pressure is greater than 15 psi (1 bar) and heat is added, the device is legally a boiler. All states in the United States except Idaho and Wyoming and all provinces in Canada have legally adopted the requirement for boilers to be registered with the National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors.National Board Synopsis Map 2015. Retrieved from Registration includes the requirements that the boiler's design be approved as meeting the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC), must be constructed in a facility currently authorized by ASME to construct such boilers, must be installed and tested to the approval of a National Board inspector, and, is required to undergo periodic inspections at the owner's expense. The jurisdiction may also require the installation be operated by a licensed stationary engineer, as well as be covered by sufficient liability insurance. The reason for such scrutiny is because of the catastrophic losses that can occur due to a boiler explosion. A system will also require an approved steam safety valve and water level control as well as valves for water into the boiler and steam to the engine. If the system is intended to run without supervision, then sensors and automatic safety shutdown systems are needed. Thus, the waste heat engine may be one of the least expensive components of a complete waste heat recovery system.

He became an anarcho-syndicalist, then a communist, and played a leading role in the French Communist Party and in the national trade union movement both before and after World War II (1939–45). Early years Gaston Monmousseau was born on 17 January 1883 in Luynes, Indre-et-Loire. His parents were Jean and Marie-Silvine Monmousseau. In his autobiography he describes himself as coming from a family of serfs attached to the Duke of Luynes. His grandfather was a Republican during the Second French Empire and his father was a radical after the Paris Commune, then a socialist against the decay of radicalism, and then a communist against the decay of socialism. Gaston Monmousseau grew up in the village of Azay-sur-Cher. After leaving school he apprenticed with a carpenter in Luynes, then moved to Tours where he worked as a carpenter. Although he had no more than elementary education, he later managed to teach himself to write and speak effectively. Anarcho- syndicalist After his military service Monmousseau joined the state railway in Paris in 1910. He became an anarcho-syndicalist, and was active in the railway workers' union. In January 1913 he organized an anti-militarist rally in a hotel in Azay-sur-Cher. During World War I (1914–18) he worked on railway maintenance. He was enthusiastic about the 1917 October Revolution in Russia. This gave him an enduring internationalist and pacifist outlook. He wrote later, At the first postwar congress of the General Confederation of Labor (CGT: Confédération générale du travail), held in Lyon from 15–21 September 1919, Monmousseau was among the leaders of the minority, with Pierre Monatte, Raymond Péricat and Joseph Tommasi. This group denounced the CGT membership in the Amsterdam International of Labor Unions, and said the CGT majority had broken with the principles of syndicalism and lost faith in revolution by dealing with the government. The minority wanted the CGT to join the Communist International, seize power and establish a dictatorship of the proletariat. They led a committee of 26 minority unions that was formed in October 1919, later named the Comité Syndicaliste Révolutionnaire (CST). In April 1920 Monmousseau was elected propaganda secretary for the railway workers federation and was arrested, along with Souvarine and Monatte, for plotting against state security. He was released in February 1921. Monmousseau was secretary-general of the Association of Trade Unions of the Paris district from 1921 to 1922. In January 1922 he replaced Pierre Monatte in running La Vie Ouvrière. He would be director of this journal until 1960. As a member of the anarcho-syndicalist minority of the CGT, Gaston Monmousseau became General Secretary of the United General Confederation of Labor (CGTU: Confédération générale du travail unitaire) after the split between CGT reformists and revolutionaries, a position he held until 1933. In November 1922 he represented the CGTU at the second congress of the Red International of Trade Unions (Profintern) in Moscow. He met Vladimir Lenin, and according to his memoirs was greatly impressed. In January 1923 he participated in the International Congress on \\"Imperialism and War\\" organized against the occupation of the Ruhr by French troops. He was imprisoned until May 1923. In August 1924 Monmousseau participated in the third Profintern congress in Moscow. Communist Demonstration of CGTU construction workers, Concarneau, Brittany, 1929 Monmousseau was pragmatic, and although he did not abandon his syndicalist beliefs, he could accept the need for a strong, repressive state to steer the revolution. Monmousseau joined the French Communist Party in 1925. He was a member of the French party's Central Committee from 1926 to 1945, and a member of the Profintern Executive Committee from 1926 to 1937. He was jailed in 1927 for organizing strikes against the war in Morocco. After his release, on 5 October 1927 he married Marcelle Louise Alice Legendre in Courçay, Indre-et-Loire. In September 1929, as a deputy member of the Comintern Executive Committee, he was charged with plotting against state security and imprisoned until May 1930. He was jailed again in April 1931, and held for four months. In 1932 he visited Moscow where he worked in the Profintern secretariat. He was a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party from 1932 to 1945. In 1935 he was elected to the International Control Commission at the Seventh Congress of the Comintern. In 1936 Monmousseau participated in bringing the CGTU back into the reunified CGT. On 26 April 1936 he was elected a deputy for the Seine in the first round of voting. He sat with the Communist group, and was mainly involved in social laws. The French Communist Party was dissolved in 1939 and he went underground. He was convicted in absentia and lost his position as deputy. During World War II (1939–45) he was an organizer of the French Resistance. His only son died in a concentration camp at Dachau. After the Liberation of Paris Monmousseau was appointed one of the twelve members of the Confederal Bureau of the CGT in September 1944. The priority after the war was reconstruction. The three parties that governed France after until mid-1947 were the Socialists, the Catholic Popular Republican Movement and the Communists. The Communists soon showed they were strongest, and promoted cooperation in reconstruction. Monmousseau told the Paris region convention of the CGT in 1946, \\"Yesterday we were in the opposition, and we could permit ourselves some vagaries. Today it is the trusts who are opposition, and we who bear the responsibilities.\\" In 1952 the National Committee of the Communist Party decided to turn their boring weekly Le Peuple into a bimonthly journal, and to make La Vie Ouvrière their official organ. Monmousseau, who directed the Vie Ouvrière, was delighted. By this time his paper had become a strident and polemical sheet that had abandoned all pretense of concern with morality and individual dignity. From 1956 to 1960 Monmousseau was again a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party. Monmousseau died in Paris on 11 July 1960 aged 77. Selected publications Monmousseau contributed to many magazines and newspapers including Le Libertaire, Le Journal du Peuple and L'Humanité. He published several works under the pseudonym Jean Brécot, including activist works and memoirs.

These are classes obtained from 1 by pushforward along various morphisms described below. The tautological cohomology ring is the image of the tautological ring under the cycle map (from the Chow ring to the cohomology ring).  Definition  Let \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n} be the moduli stack of stable marked curves (C;x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n), such that * C is a complex curve of arithmetic genus g whose only singularities are nodes, * the n points x1, ..., xn are distinct smooth points of C, * the marked curve is stable, namely its automorphism group (leaving marked points invariant) is finite. The last condition requires 2g-2+n>0 in other words (g,n) is not among (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0). The stack \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n} then has dimension 3g-3+n. Besides permutations of the marked points, the following morphisms between these moduli stacks play an important role in defining tautological classes: * Forgetful maps \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n} \\\\to \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n-1} which act by removing a given point xk from the set of marked points, then restabilizing the marked curved if it is not stable anymore. * Gluing maps \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n+1}\\\\times\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g',n'+1} \\\\to \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g+g',n+n'} that identify the k-th marked point of a curve to the l-th marked point of the other. Another set of gluing maps is \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n+2} \\\\to \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g+1,n} that identify the k-th and l-th marked points, thus increasing the genus by creating a closed loop. The tautological rings R^\\\\bullet(\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}) are simultaneously defined as the smallest subrings of the Chow rings closed under pushforward by forgetful and gluing maps. The tautological cohomology ring RH^\\\\bullet(\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}) is the image of R^\\\\bullet (\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}) under the cycle map. As of 2016, it is not known whether the tautological and tautological cohomology rings are isomorphic.  Generating set  For 1\\\\leq k\\\\leq n we define the class \\\\psi_k\\\\in R^\\\\bullet(\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}) as follows. Let \\\\delta_k be the pushforward of 1 along the gluing map \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}\\\\times\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{0,3}\\\\to\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n+1} which identifies the marked point xk of the first curve to one of the three marked points yi on the sphere (the latter choice is unimportant thanks to automorphisms). For definiteness order the resulting points as x1, ..., xk−1, y1, y2, xk+1, ..., xn. Then \\\\psi_k is defined as the pushforward of -\\\\delta_k^2 along the forgetful map that forgets the point y2. This class coincides with the first Chern class of a certain line bundle. For i\\\\geq 1 we also define \\\\kappa_i\\\\in R^\\\\bullet(\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}) be the pushforward of (\\\\psi_k)^{i+1} along the forgetful map \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n+1}\\\\to\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n} that forgets the k-th point. This is independent of k (simply permute points). :Theorem. R^\\\\bullet(\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}) is additively generated by pushforwards along (any number of) gluing maps of monomials in \\\\psi and \\\\kappa classes. These pushforwards of monomials (hereafter called basic classes) do not form a basis. The set of relations is not fully known. :Theorem. The tautological rings are invariant under pullback along gluing and forgetful maps. There exist universal combinatorial formulae expressing pushforwards, pullbacks, and products of basic classes as linear combinations of basic classes.  Faber conjectures  The tautological ring R^\\\\bullet(\\\\mathcal{M}_{g,n}) on the moduli space of smooth n-pointed genus g curves simply consists of restrictions of classes in R^\\\\bullet(\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}). We omit n when it is zero (when there is no marked point). In the case n=0 of curves with no marked point, Mumford conjectured, and Madsen and Weiss proved, that for any d>0 the map \\\\Q[\\\\kappa_1, \\\\kappa_2, \\\\ldots]\\\\to H^\\\\bullet(\\\\mathcal{M}_g) is an isomorphism in degree d for large enough g. In this case all classes are tautological. :Conjecture (Faber). (1) Large-degree tautological rings vanish: R^d(\\\\mathcal{M}_g)=0 for d>g-2. (2) R^{g-2}(\\\\mathcal{M}_g)\\\\cong\\\\Q and there is an explicit combinatorial formula for this isomorphism. (3) The product (coming from the Chow ring) of classes defines a perfect pairing R^{d}(\\\\mathcal{M}_g) \\\\times R^{g-d-2}(\\\\mathcal{M}_g) \\\\to R^{g-2}(\\\\mathcal{M}_g) \\\\cong \\\\Q. Although R^d(\\\\mathcal{M}_g) trivially vanishes for d>3g-3 because of the dimension of \\\\mathcal{M}_g, the conjectured bound is much lower. The conjecture would completely determine the structure of the ring: a polynomial in the \\\\kappa_j of cohomological degree d vanishes if and only if its pairing with all polynomials of cohomological degree g-d-2 vanishes. Parts (1) and (2) of the conjecture were proven. Part (3), also called the Gorenstein conjecture, was only checked for g<24. For g=24 and higher genus, several methods of constructing relations between \\\\kappa classes find the same set of relations which suggest that the dimensions of R^d(\\\\mathcal{M}_g) and R^{g-d-2}(\\\\mathcal{M}_g) are different. If the set of relations found by these methods is complete then the Gorenstein conjecture is wrong. Besides Faber's original non-systematic computer search based on classical maps between vector bundles over \\\\mathcal{C}_g^d, the d-th fiber power of the universal curve \\\\mathcal{C}_g = \\\\mathcal{M}_{g,1} \\\\twoheadrightarrow \\\\mathcal{M}_g, the following methods have been used to find relations: * Virtual classes of the moduli space of stable quotients (over \\\\mathbb{P}^1) by Pandharipande and Pixton. * Witten's r-spin class and Givental-Telemann's classification of cohomological field theories, used by Pandharipande, Pixton, Zvonkine. * Geometry of the universal Jacobian over \\\\mathcal{M}_{g,1}, by Yin. * Powers of theta-divisor on the universal abelian variety, by Grushevsky and Zakharov. These four methods are proven to give the same set of relations.

Built c. 1835-37, it is a particularly elaborate local example of Greek Revival architecture, made more distinctive by the relatively advanced use of stoves as a heating system at the time of its construction. The house was built by a son-in-law of American Revolutionary War General Henry Knox, and was owned for many years by Hannibal Ingalls, a prominent local businessman. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The Ingalls House is set on the south side of Main Street, between its junction with Rome Road and Bog Stream and a short way west of the cluster of buildings that mark the center of the village. It is a -story wood-frame structure, with a side gable roof clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. It originally had two chimneys, one at either end, but the one on the right has been taken down. The north-facing front facade has a typical 18th-century symmetrical five-bay facade with a center entrance. The entry is flanked by sidelight windows and framed by simple Greek Revival trim. A single-story shed-roof porch extends across the front, supported by fluted Doric columns. Its entablature extends around the sides of the porch, giving them a partially pedimented appearance. The main roof's side gables are also fully pedimented, with a narrow entablature extending around the building, and simple pilasters at the corners. The interior of the house follows a typical central-hall plan, and has restrained Greek Revival woodwork. Its most unusual feature is the heating system, which was, by the architectural evidence, originally designed for heating provided by stoves rather than open fires. This would have been a technologically advanced choice for central Maine, where many houses were still built with full fireplaces. None of the original stoves was retained when the house heating was modernized in the 20th century. The house was built in 1835-37 by Ebenezer Thatcher, whose wife Julia was the daughter of American Revolutionary War General and Maine land magnate Henry Knox. Later in the 19th century it was owned by Hannibal Ingalls, a prominent local businessman.

The main objectives were to improve welfare, Belarusian national revival, protect national and civil rights and saving the Belarusian language from Russification. The ultimate goal was to build an independent Belarusian state.  History  The Union of Belarusian Patriots was founded in early 1946 in the Hlybokaye and Pastavy. In the summer of 1946, an underground patriotic organization formed in Slonim whose conspiratorial name was \\"Seagull\\". It was founded by young teachers and activists. During this year, these communities were in Baranavichy, Brest, Navahrudak and Zhyrovichy. In the summer of 1946 the communities of Baranavichy, Slonim and Navahrudak united in the center of Belarusian Liberation Movement under the leadership of Vasil Suprun. In the summer of 1947 a regional management structure was founded. It was headed by Alyaxandar Bareyka (Baranavichy Voblast), Mikola Makarevich (Brest Voblast), Syarhei Yanousky (Molodechno Voblast) and Mikola Lyaskavets (Pinsk Voblast). At the same time, the final name of the movement was decided – \\"The Union of Belarusian Patriots\\". In the winter of 1947 the organization was liquidated by Soviet security organs. Two military tribunals were held, in Baranavichy and in Minsk. Members of the organisation were accused of anti-Soviet activity and punished by executions, camps and prison.100 пытанняў і адказаў з гісторыі Беларусі / Уклад. І. Саверчанка, Зм.

Its primary competitors are other open source trading platforms, mainly Numerai, QuantConnect, & WorldQuant.  History  Quantopian was founded in 2011 by John Fawcett and Jean Bredeche. Over its history, Quantopian has raised $48.8M from investors such as Spark Capital, Khosla Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Point72 Ventures, and Andreessen Horowitz. As of July 2016, the company consisted of 45 employees, up from 20 employees in January 2014 and 12 in January 2014. As of August 2018, the company had over 210,000 members compared to 85,000 in July 2016, 20,000 in May 2014, and 10,000 in October 2013. In July 2016 Steven A. Cohen, chief executive officer of Point72 Asset Management, announced his firm will put up to $250M under the direction of algorithms managed by Quantopian and in addition make an investment in Quantopian itself. The company has funded individual algorithms with as much as $50,000,000. In February 2020 Quantopian announced it would return investors' money due to the underperformance of its investment strategies. https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2020/02/20/fintech-firm-quantopian-is- returning-investors.html  Business model  The company has a two-sided market business model: The first side consists of algorithm-developer members who develop and test for free, focusing on algorithm development for factors that can be added to Quantopian's offerings to institutional investors. All members can compete against other members in a series of contests called the \\"Quantopian Open.\\" Anyone can join the site and (optionally) enter the contests: no particular educational qualification nor work experience are required. Quantopian provides them with free data sources and tools, largely built in the Python programming language. The second side is institutional investors. Serving them will become the main focus of Quantopian. These members have their investments managed by the winning algorithms. Successful developer-members can get a royalty or commission from investor-members, who profit from the former's algorithm used with larger resources > $1M. Board member Andrew Parker claims that Quantopian is aiming for modest number of users and a large average revenue per user (ARPU); more like Bloomberg than Facebook. The business model capitalizes on a trend jokingly dubbed \\"the latest DIY craze\\" by the Wall Street Journal. Previously the company provided brokerage integrations to individual investors. These integrations were continued by the community who started the open source project Zipline-Live In 2018, the company announced the availability of an enterprise software product for asset managers, in partnership with FactSet.  Technology  Quantopian's web-based product is written in Python. Parts of the company's technology are available under an open source license, in particular, their backtesting engine dubbed \\"Zipline.\\" The uploaded algorithms of users remain the trade secrets of the individual (unless the person chooses to publish them). The company claims that its employees are forbidden from accessing the submitted algorithms (except in certain circumstances) and that protection is ensured by \\"alignment of interests,\\" meaning that all users would leave and the company collapse if that trust were ever violated. The company does however reserve the right to review the performance and other outputs of user's algorithms. Allowing users to run arbitrary code on its servers poses some unusual cyber-security challenges.  Usage in study of corporate governance  In 2020, Quantopian maintains an all male leadership team. In 2015, Quantopian's Director of Products, Karen Rubin, used the service in a study that showed that a hypothetical portfolio of investments in women-led companies would perform three times better than an investment in an index fund based on the S&P; 500 over the same period. Her study was inspired by a Credit Suisse’s Gender 3000 report, specifically that \\"Companies with more than one woman on the board have returned a compound 3.7% a year over those that have none...\\" and yet paradoxically only \\"12.7% of boards had gender diversity.\\"  Usage as alternate platform for higher education  Writing for Wired magazine, Fawcett proposes that Quantopian be used as a MOOC-like platform for higher education.  Awards  Quantopian was ranked #98 on Forbes' 2014 \\"List of America's Most Promising Companies.\\" Also in 2014, Mike Hogan of Barron's called it \\"Best site for quants.\\"  References  Category:Investment management companies of the United States ","title":"Quantopian"},{"id":"46187677","text":":See Human migration. Human migration is the movement by people from one place to another, particularly different countries, with the intention of settling temporarily or permanently in the new location. It typically involves movements over long distances and from one country or region to another. Historically, early human migration includes the peopling of the world, i.e. migration to world regions where there was previously no human habitation, during the Upper Paleolithic. Since the Neolithic, most migrations (except for the peopling of remote regions such as the Arctic or the Pacific), were predominantly warlike, consisting of conquest or Landnahme on the part of expanding populations. Colonialism involves expansion of sedentary populations into previously only sparsely settled territories or territories with no permanent settlements. In the modern period, human migration has primarily taken the form of migration within and between existing sovereign states, either controlled (legal immigration) or uncontrolled and in violation of immigration laws (illegal immigration). Migration can be voluntary or involuntary. Involuntary migration includes forced displacement (in various forms such as deportation, slave trade, trafficking in human beings) and flight (war refugees, ethnic cleansing), both resulting in the creation of diasporas. Pre-modern history A map of early human migrations.Literature: Göran Burenhult: Die ersten Menschen, Weltbild Verlag, 2000. Studies show that the pre-modern migration of human populations begins with the movement of Homo erectus out of Africa across Eurasia about 1.75 million years ago. Homo sapiens appears to have occupied all of Africa about 150,000 years ago; some members of this species moved out of Africa 70,000 years ago (or, according to more recent studies, as early as 125,000 years ago into Asia,Compare: and even as early as 270,000 years ago), and had spread across Australia, Asia and Europe by 40,000 BC. Migration to the Americas took place 20,000 to 15,000 years ago. By 2000 years ago humans had established settlements in most of the Pacific Islands. Major population-movements notably include those postulated as associated with the Neolithic Revolution and with Indo-European expansion. The Early Medieval Great Migrations including Turkic expansion have left significant traces. In some places, such as Turkey and Azerbaijan, there was a substantial cultural transformation after the migration of relatively small elite populations. Historians see elite-migration parallels in the Roman and Norman conquests of Britain, while \\"the most hotly debated of all the British cultural transitions is the role of migration in the relatively sudden and drastic change from Romano-Britain to Anglo-Saxon Britain\\", which may be explained by a possible \\"substantial migration of Anglo-Saxon Y chromosomes into Central England (contributing 50%–100% to the gene pool at that time).\\" Chronological dispersal of Austronesian people across the Indo-Pacific Early humans migrated due to many factors, such as changing climate and landscape and inadequate food-supply for the levels of population. The evidence indicates that the ancestors of the Austronesian peoples spread from the South Chinese mainland to the island of Taiwan around 8,000 years ago. Evidence from historical linguistics suggests that seafaring peoples migrated from Taiwan, perhaps in distinct waves separated by millennia, to the entire region encompassed by the Austronesian languages. Scholars believe that this migration began around 6,000 years ago.Language trees support the express- train sequence of Austronesian expansion, Nature Indo-Aryan migration from the Indus Valley to the plain of the River Ganges in Northern India is presumed to have taken place in the Middle to Late Bronze Age, contemporary with the Late Harappan phase in India (around 1700 to 1300 BC). From 180 BC a series of invasions from Central Asia followed in the northwestern Indian subcontinent, including those led by the Indo-Greeks, Indo-Scythians, Indo-Parthians and Kushans.The appearance of Indo-Aryan speakers, Encyclopædia BritannicaGenetic Evidence on the Origins of Indian Caste Populations - Bamshad et al. 11 (6): 994, Genome Research From 728 BC, the Greeks began 250 years of expansion, settling colonies in several places, including Sicily and Marseille. Classical-era Europe provides evidence of two major migration movements: the Celtic peoples in the first millennium BC, and the later Migration Period of the first millennium AD from the North and East. Both may be examples of general cultural change sparked by primarily elite and warrior migration. A smaller migration (or sub-migration) involved the Magyars moving into Pannonia (modern-day Hungary) in the 9th century AD. Turkic peoples spread from their homeland in modern Turkestan across most of Central Asia into Europe and the Middle East between the 6th and 11th centuries AD. Recent research suggests that Madagascar was uninhabited until Austronesian seafarers from present-day Indonesia arrived during the 5th and 6th centuries AD. Subsequent migrations both from the Pacific and from Africa further consolidated this original mixture, and Malagasy people emerged.Malagasy languages, Encyclopædia Britannica 4th to 6th century Migration Period Before the expansion of the Bantu languages and their speakers, the southern half of Africa is believed to have been populated by Pygmies and Khoisan-speaking people, whose descendants today occupy the arid regions around the Kalahari Desert and the forests of Central Africa. By about 1000 AD Bantu migration had reached modern-day Zimbabwe and South Africa. The Banu Hilal and Banu Ma'qil, a collection of Arab Bedouin tribes from the Arabian Peninsula, migrated westwards via Egypt between the 11th and 13th centuries. Their migration strongly contributed to the Arabisation and Islamisation of the western Maghreb, until then dominated by Berber tribes. Ostsiedlung was the medieval eastward migration and settlement of Germans - following in the footsteps of East Germanic Goths and North Germanic Varangians. The 13th century was the time of the great Mongol and Turkic migrations across Eurasia,Migrations-&-World History where the Eurasian steppe has time and again provided a ready migration-path - for (for example) Huns, Bulgars, Tatars and Slavs. Between the 11th and 18th centuries, numerous migrations took place in Asia. The Vatsayan Priests migrated from the eastern Himalaya hills to Kashmir during the Shan invasion in the 13th century. They settled in the lower Shivalik Hills in the 13th century to sanctify the manifest goddess. In the Ming occupation, the Vietnamese started expanding southward in the 11th century; this is known in Vietnamese as nam tiến (southward expansion).The Le Dynasty and Southward Expansion The early Qing Dynasty (founded in 1636) separated Manchuria from China proper with the Inner Willow Palisade, which restricted the movement of the Han Chinese into Manchuria, as the area was off-limits (British English: out of bounds) to the Han until the Qing started colonizing the area with them (late 18th century) later on in the dynasty's rule.From Ming to Qing The Age of Exploration and European colonialism has led to an accelerated pace of migration since Early Modern times. In the 16th century, perhaps 240,000 Europeans entered American ports.\\"The Colombian Mosaic in Colonial America\\" by James Axtell In the 19th century over 50 million people left Europe for the Americas alone.David Eltis Economic Growth and the Ending of the Transatlantic slave trade The local populations or tribes, such as the Aboriginal people in Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Japan Report on a New Policy for the Ainu: A Critique and the United States, were often numerically overwhelmed by incoming settlers and by those settlers' indentured laborers and imported slaves. Modern history Industrialization When the pace of migration had accelerated since the 18th century already (including the involuntary slave trade), it would increase further in the 19th century. Manning distinguishes three major types of migration: labor migration, refugee migrations, and urbanization. Millions of agricultural workers left the countryside and moved to the cities causing unprecedented levels of urbanization. This phenomenon began in Britain in the late 18th century and spread around the world and continues to this day in many areas. Industrialization encouraged migration wherever it appeared. The increasingly global economy globalized the labor market. The Atlantic slave trade diminished sharply after 1820, which gave rise to self-bound contract labor migration from Europe and Asia to plantations. Overpopulation, open agricultural frontiers, and rising industrial centers attracted voluntary migrants. Moreover, migration was significantly made easier by improved transportation techniques. Romantic nationalism also rose in the 19th century, and, with it, ethnocentrism. The great European industrial empires also rose. Both factors contributed to migration, as some countries favored their own ethnicity over outsiders and other countries appeared to be considerably more welcoming. For example, the Russian Empire identified with Eastern Orthodoxy, and confined Jews, who were not Eastern Orthodox, to the Pale of Settlement and imposed restrictions. Violence was also a problem. The United States was promoted as a better location, a \\"golden land\\" where Jews could live more openly.See World of our Fathers, by Irving Howe, and particularly the first sixty or so pages of that book Another effect of imperialism, colonialism, led to the migration of some colonizing parties from \\"home countries\\" to \\"the colonies\\", and eventually the migration of people from \\"colonies\\" to \\"home countries\\".For example, people migrated from the Indian subcontinent to the UK during the Imperial era and afterwards. Transnational labor migration reached a peak of three million migrants per year in the early twentieth century. Italy, Norway, Ireland and the Guangdong region of China were regions with especially high emigration rates during these years. These large migration flows influenced the process of nation state formation in many ways. Immigration restrictions have been developed, as well as diaspora cultures and myths that reflect the importance of migration to the foundation of certain nations, like the American melting pot. The transnational labor migration fell to a lower level from the 1930s to the 1960s and then rebounded. The United States experienced considerable internal migration related to industrialization, including its African American population. From 1910 to 1970, approximately 7 million African Americans migrated from the rural Southern United States, where blacks faced both poor economic opportunities and considerable political and social prejudice, to the industrial cities of the Northeast, Midwest and West, where relatively well-paid jobs were available.Great Migration, accessed 12/7/2007 This phenomenon came to be known in the United States as its own Great Migration, although historians today consider the migration to have two distinct phases. The term \\"Great Migration\\", without a qualifier, is now most often used to refer the first phase, which ended roughly at the time of the Great Depression. The second phase, lasting roughly from the start of U.S. involvement in World War II to 1970, is now called the Second Great Migration. With the demise of legalised segregation in the 1960s and greatly improved economic opportunities in the South in the subsequent decades, millions of blacks have returned to the South from other parts of the country since 1980 in what has been called the New Great Migration. World wars and aftermath Swiss woman and her children leaving Civil war in Russia, around 1921 The First and Second World Wars, and wars, genocides, and crises sparked by them, had an enormous impact on migration. Muslims moved from the Balkan to Turkey, while Christians moved the other way, during the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. In April 1915 the Ottoman government embarked upon the systematic decimation of its civilian Armenian population. The persecutions continued with varying intensity until 1923 when the Ottoman Empire ceased to exist and was replaced by the Republic of Turkey. The Armenian population of the Ottoman state was reported at about two million in 1915. An estimated one million had perished by 1918, while hundreds of thousands had become homeless and stateless refugees. By 1923 virtually the entire Armenian population of Anatolian Turkey had disappeared. Four hundred thousand Jews had already moved to Palestine in the early twentieth century, and numerous Jews to America, as already mentioned. The Russian Civil War caused some three million Russians, Poles, and Germans to migrate out of the new Soviet Union. Decolonization following the Second World War also caused migrations.Patrick Manning, Migration in World History (2005) p 132-162. The Jewish communities across Europe, the Mediterranean and the Middle East were formed from voluntary and involuntary migrants. After the Holocaust (1938 to 1945), there was increased migration to the British Mandate of Palestine, which became the modern state of Israel as a result of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. Provisions of the Potsdam Agreement from 1945 signed by victorious Western Allies and the Soviet Union led to one of the largest European migrations, and the largest in the 20th century. It involved the migration and resettlement of close to or over 20 million people. The largest affected group were 16.5 million Germans expelled from Eastern Europe westwards. The second largest group were Poles, millions of whom were expelled westwards from eastern Kresy region and resettled in the so-called Recovered Territories (see Allies decide Polish border in the article on the Oder-Neisse line). Hundreds of thousands of Poles, Ukrainians (Operation Vistula), Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians and some Belarusians were expelled eastwards from Europe to the Soviet Union. Finally, many of the several hundred thousand Jews remaining in Eastern Europe after the Holocaust migrated outside Europe to Israel and the United States. =Partition of India= In 1947, upon the Partition of India, large populations moved from India to Pakistan and vice versa, depending on their religious beliefs. The partition was created by the Indian Independence Act 1947 as a result of the dissolution of the British Indian Empire. The partition displaced up to 17 million people in the former British Indian Empire,Pakistan:History, Culture, and Government by Nigel Smith, Page 112 with estimates of loss of life varying from several hundred thousand to a million.Metcalf, Barbara; Metcalf, Thomas R. (2006), A Concise History of Modern India (Cambridge Concise Histories), Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press. Pp. xxxiii, 372, . Muslim residents of the former British India migrated to Pakistan (including East Pakistan, now Bangladesh), whilst Hindu and Sikh residents of Pakistan and Hindu residents of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) moved in the opposite direction. In modern India, estimates based on industry sectors mainly employing migrants suggest that there are around 100 million circular migrants in India. Caste, social networks and historical precedents play a powerful role in shaping patterns of migration. Research by the Overseas Development Institute identifies a rapid movement of labor from slower- to faster-growing parts of the economy. Migrants can often find themselves excluded by urban housing policies, and migrant support initiatives are needed to give workers improved access to market information, certification of identity, housing and education. In the riots which preceded the partition in the Punjab region, between 200,000 and 500,000 people were killed in the retributive genocide. U.N.H.C.R. estimates 14 million Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims were displaced during the partition. Scholars call it the largest mass migration in human history: Nigel Smith, in his book Pakistan: History, Culture, and Government, calls it \\"history's greatest migration.\\" Contemporary history (1960s to present) See also *Early human migrations *Human migration *Immigration § History *Refugee crisis *Timeline of maritime migration and exploration Further reading * * Barbara Luethi: Migration and Migration History, version 2, in: Docupedia Zeitgeschichte, 06.

The adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The adult leaves are the same glossy, dark green colour on both sides. The flower buds are arranged in branching inflorescences on a peduncle long with between seven and eleven flowers in each umbel. Mature buds are club-shaped to oblong, long and wide on a pedicel up to long. The operculum is conical to rounded. White, pink, mauve or purple flowers appear in most months. The fruit is cup-shaped to barrel-shaped or more or less cylindrical, long and wide. Taxonomy and naming The purple-flowered mallee box was first formally described in 1974 by Clifford David Boomsma who gave it the name Eucalyptus lansdowneana subsp. albopurpurea and published the description in the South Australian Naturalist from a specimen collected by Reginald Allan Dorward. In 2000, Dean Nicolle raised it to species status as Eucalyptus albopurpurea. The specific epithet (albopurpurea) is derived from the Latin words albus meaning \\"white\\" and purpureus meaning \\"purple\\", referring to the variation in the flower colour. Distribution and habitat Eucalyptus albopurpurea is only known from Kangaroo Island and the southern tip of the Eyre Peninsula where it grows on sandhills near the ocean and around seasonally wet areas.

Benefiting from their remarkable electrochemical properties, these MTMOs will play significant roles for low‐cost and environmentally friendly energy storage/conversion technologies. In this Review, we summarize recent research advances in the rational design and efficient synthesis of MTMOs with controlled shapes, sizes, compositions, and micro‐/nanostructures, along with their applications as electrode materials for lithium‐ion batteries and electrochemical capacitors, and efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction in metal–air batteries and fuel cells. Some future trends and prospects to further develop advanced MTMOs for next‐generation electrochemical energy storage/conversion systems are also presented. *Zhang, X., Xie, X., Wang, H., Zhang, J., Pan, B., & Xie, Y.

Journal of the American Chemical Society, 135(1), 18–21. . *Two-dimensional nanosheets have attracted tremendous attention because of their promising practical application and theoretical values. The atomic-thick nanosheets are able to not only enhance the intrinsic properties of their bulk counterparts but also give birth to new promising properties. Herein, we highlight an available pathway to prepare the ultrathin graphitic-phase C3N4 (g-C3N4) nanosheets by a “green” liquid exfoliation route from bulk g-C3N4 in water for the first time. The as-obtained ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheet solution is very stable in both the acidic and alkaline environment and shows pH-dependent photoluminescence (PL). Compared to the bulk g-C3N4, ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets show enhanced intrinsic photoabsorption and photoresponse, which induce their extremely high PL quantum yield up to 19.6%. Thus, benefiting from the inherent blue light PL with high quantum yields and high stability, good biocompatibility, and nontoxicity, the water-soluble ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheet is a brand-new but promising candidate for bioimaging application. First-principle density-functional (Density functional theory (DFT)) calculations were performed to study the electronic structure of the bulk and single-layered nanosheet of g-C3N4. Spectroscopy tools such as Transmission electron microscopy and Atomic force microscopy were used for acquiring structural information about the nanosheet. In addition, Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy was employed for photoluminescence characterization.

During its time, the system was so prominent that more than half of all immigrants to British colonies south of New England were white servants, and that nearly half of total white immigration to the Thirteen Colonies came under indenture. By the beginning of the American Revolutionary War in 1775, only 2 to 3 percent of the colonial labor force was composed of indentured servants. The consensus view among economic historians and economists is that indentured servitude became popular in the Thirteen Colonies in the seventeenth century because of a large demand for labor there, coupled with labor surpluses in Europe and high costs of transatlantic transportation beyond the means of European workers. Between the 1630s and the American Revolution, one-half to two-thirds of white immigrants to the Thirteen Colonies arrived under indentures.Galenson 1984: 1 Half a million Europeans, mostly young men, also went to the Caribbean under indenture to work on plantations. Most indentures were voluntary, although some people were tricked or coerced into them. A debt peonage system similar to indenture was also used in southern New England and Long Island to control and assimilate Native Americans from the 1600s through the American Revolution. Indentured servitude continued in North America into the early 20th century, but the number of indentured servants declined over time. Although experts do not agree on the causes of the decline, possible factors for the American colonies include changes in the labor market and the legal system that made it cheaper and less risky for an employer to hire African slave labor or paid employees, or made indentures unlawful; increased affordability of travel to North America that made immigrants less likely to rely on indentures to pay travel costs; and effects of the American Revolution, particularly on immigration from Britain. In the Caribbean, the number of indentured servants from Europe began to decline in the 17th century as Europeans became aware of the cruelty of plantation masters and the high death rate of servants, largely due to tropical disease. After the British Empire ended slavery in 1833, plantation owners returned to indentured servitude for labor, with most servants coming from India, until the British government prohibited the practice in 1917.Galenson 1984: 26 North America Between one-half and two-thirds of European immigrants to the Thirteen Colonies between the 1630s and the American Revolution came under indentures. The practice was sufficiently common that the Habeas Corpus Act 1679, in part, prevented imprisonments overseas; it also made provisions for those with existing transportation contracts and those \\"praying to be transported\\" in lieu of remaining in prison upon conviction.Charles II, 1679: An Act for the better securing the Liberty of the Subject and for Prevention of Imprisonments beyond the Seas., Statutes of the Realm: Volume 5, 1628–1680, pp. 935–38. Great Britain Record Commission, (1819) In any case, while half the European immigrants to the Thirteen Colonies had been indentured servants at some time, actively indentured servants were outnumbered by non-indentured workers, or by those whose indenture had expired. Thus free wage labor was more common for Europeans in the colonies.John Donoghue, \\"Indentured Servitude in the 17th Century English Atlantic: A Brief Survey of the Literature,\\" History Compass (2013) 11#10 pp. 893–902. Indentured persons were numerically important mostly in the region from Virginia north to New Jersey. Other colonies saw far fewer of them. The total number of European immigrants to all 13 colonies before 1775 was 500,000–550,000; of these, 55,000 were involuntary prisoners. Of the 450,000 or so European arrivals who came voluntarily, Tomlins estimates that 48% were indentured.Christopher Tomlins, \\"Reconsidering Indentured Servitude: European Migration and the Early American Labor Force, 1600–1775,\\" Labor History (2001) 42#1 pp. 5–43 About 75% were under the age of 25. The age of legal adulthood for men was 24 years; those over 24 generally came on contracts lasting about 3 years.Tomlins (2001) at notes 31, 42, 66 Regarding the children who came, Gary Nash reports that, \\"many of the servants were actually nephews, nieces, cousins and children of friends of emigrating Englishmen, who paid their passage in return for their labor once in America.\\"Gary Nash (1979). The Urban Crucible: The Northern Seaports and the Origins of the American Revolution. p. 15 Farmers, merchants, and shopkeepers in the British colonies found it very difficult to hire free workers, primarily because it was easy for potential workers to set up their own farms.Fred Shannon, Economic History of the People of the United States (1934) pp. 73–79 Consequently, a common solution was to transport a young worker from Britain or a German state, who would work for several years to pay off the debt of their travel costs. During the indenture period the servants were not paid cash wages, but were provided with food, accommodation, clothing and training. The indenture document specified how many years the servant would be required to work, after which they would be free. Terms of indenture ranged from one to seven years with typical terms of four or five years.White Servitude , by Richard Hofstadter In southern New England, a variant form of indentured servitude, which controlled the labor of Native Americans through an exploitative debt-peonage system, developed in the late 17th century and continued through to the period of the American Revolution. Not all European servants came willingly. Several instances of kidnapping for transportation to the Americas are recorded, though these were often indentured in the same way as their willing counterparts. An illustrative example is that of Peter Williamson (1730–1799). As historian Richard Hofstadter pointed out, \\"Although efforts were made to regulate or check their activities, and they diminished in importance in the eighteenth century, it remains true that a certain small part of the white colonial population of America was brought by force, and a much larger portion came in response to deceit and misrepresentation on the part of the spirits [recruiting agents].\\" Many white immigrants arrived in colonial America as indentured servants, usually as young men and women from Britain or Germany, under the age of 21. Typically, the father of a teenager would sign the legal papers, and work out an arrangement with a ship captain, who would not charge the father any money.William Moraley and Susan E. Klepp, The infortunate: the voyage and adventures of William Moraley an indentured servant, p. xx. The captain would transport the indentured servants to the American colonies, and sell their legal papers to someone who needed workers. At the end of the indenture, the young person was given a new suit of clothes and was free to leave. Many immediately set out to begin their own farms, while others used their newly acquired skills to pursue a trade.James Curtis Ballagh, White Servitude In The Colony Of Virginia: A Study Of The System Of Indentured Labor In The American Colonies (1895)Frank R. Diffenderffer (1979). The German Immigration into Pennsylvania Through the Port of Philadelphia, 1700–1775. A few became sufficiently prosperous that they were eventually able to acquire indentured servants of their own.The Fort Scott Tribune, (newspaper) Fort Scott, Kansas, November 3, 1986, p. 4B Given the high death rate, many servants did not live to the end of their terms. In the 18th and early 19th century, numerous Europeans, mostly from outside the British Isles, traveled to the colonies as redemptioners, a particularly harsh form of indenture. Indentured servants were a separate category from bound apprentices. The latter were American-born children, usually orphans or from an impoverished family who could not care for them. They were under the control of courts and were bound out to work as an apprentice until a certain age. Two famous bound apprentices were Benjamin Franklin who illegally fled his apprenticeship to his brother, and Andrew Johnson, who later became President of the United States.Ruth Wallis Herndon and John E. Murray, eds., Children Bound to Labor: The Pauper Apprentice System in Early America (2009) George Washington used indentured servants;\\"George Washington: Farmer\\", by Paul Leland Haworth. in April 1775, he offered a reward for the return of two runaway white servants.\\"The forgotten history of Britain's white slaves\\". The Daily Telegraph. May 3, 2007. Development Indentured servitude in the Americas was first used by the Virginia Company in the early seventeenth century as a method for collateralizing the debt finance for transporting people to its newfound British colonies. Before the rise of indentured servitude, a large demand for labor existed in the colonies to help build settlements, farm crops and serve as tradesmen, but many laborers in Europe could not afford the transatlantic crossing, which could cost roughly half a worker's annual wage.Galenson 1984: 3 European financial institutions could not easily lend to the workers since there was no effective way to enforce a loan from across the Atlantic, rendering labor immobile via the Atlantic because of capital market imperfections. To address this imperfection, the Virginia Company would allow laborers to borrow against their future earnings at the Virginia Company for a fixed number of years in order to raise sufficient capital to pay for their voyage. Evidence shows this practice was in use by 1609, only two years after the founding of the Virginia Company's original Jamestown settlement.Galenson 1984: 4 However, this practice created a financial risk for the Virginia Company. If workers died or refused to work, the investment would be lost. By 1620, the Virginia Company switched to selling contracts of \\"one hundred servants to be disposed among the old Planters\\" as soon as the servants reached the colonies.Galenson 1984: 6 This minimized risk on its investment to the 2–3 months of transatlantic voyage. As the system gained in popularity, individual farmers and tradesmen would eventually begin investing in indentured servants as well.Galenson 1984: 8 The archaeological excavation of a 17th-century Maryland residence in Anne Arundel County discovered what was most likely an indentured servant who was murdered buried and hidden beneath the floor alongside a garbage pit.National Museum of Natural History. Smithsonian Institution. (February 7, 2009 – January 6, 2014). \\"Exhibition: Written in Bone: Forensic Files of the Seventeenth Century Chesapeake.\\" Smithsonian website Retrieved 14 November 2018. In 1661 Virginia law prohibited the inappropriate burial of indentured servants.Lost Towns Project, Inc. \\"Leavy Neck (18AN828).\\" Lost Towns Project website Retrieved 14 November 2018. In the 18th century, wages in Great Britain were low because of a surplus of labor. The average monetary wage was about 50 shillings (£2.50, ) a year for a plowman, and 40 shillings (£2) a year for an ordinary unskilled worker. Ships' captains negotiated prices for transporting and feeding a passenger on the seven- or eight-week journey across the ocean, averaging about £5 to £7, the equivalent of years of work back in England.Shannon, Economic History of the People of the United States (1934) pp. 75–76 Still, demand for indentured labor remained relatively low until the adoption of staple crops, such as sugarcane in the West Indies or tobacco in the American South.Galenson March 1981: 40 With economies largely based on these crops, the West Indies and American South would see the vast majority of indentured labour.Galenson March 1981: 39 Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who had paid for Mayer to travel from Europe. Author and historian Richard Hofstadter has written: > The most unenviable situation was that of servants on Southern plantations, > living alongside but never with Negro slaves, both groups doing much the > same work, often under the supervision of a relentless overseer… Even as > late as 1770, William Eddis, the English surveyor of customs at Annapolis, > thought that the Maryland Negroes were better off than \\"the Europeans, over > whom the rigid planter exercises an inflexible severity.\\" The Negroes, Eddis > thought, were a lifelong property so were treated with a certain care, but > the whites were \\"strained to the utmost to perform their allotted labour.\\" Over time the market for indentured servitude developed, with length of contracts showing close correlations to indicators of health and productivity. Tall, strong, healthy, literate or skilled servants would often serve shorter terms than less productive or more sickly servants.Grubb 1985: 868Galenson June 1981: 462 Similarly, destinations with harsh working climates such as the West Indies would come to offer shorter contracts compared to the more hospitable colonies. The majority of indentured servants ended up in the American South, where cash crops necessitated labor-intensive farming. As the Northern colonies moved toward industrialization, they received far less indentured immigration.Grubb July 1985: 328 For example, 96% of English emigrants to Virginia and Maryland from 1773 to 1776 were indentured servants. During the same time period, 2% of English emigrants to New England were indentured.Grubb July 1985: 334 Legal documents Indenture of apprenticeship binding Evan Morgan, a child aged 6 years and 11 months, for a period of 14 years, 1 month.

Restrictions Indentures could not marry without the permission of their owner, were subject to physical punishment (like many young ordinary servants), and saw their obligation to labor enforced by the courts. To ensure uninterrupted work by the female servants, the law lengthened the term of their indenture if they became pregnant. But unlike slaves, servants were guaranteed to be eventually released from bondage. At the end of their term they received a payment known as \\"freedom dues\\" and become free members of society.Eric Foner: Give me liberty. W.W. Norton & Company, 2004. . One could buy and sell indentured servants' contracts, and the right to their labor would change hands, but not the person as a piece of property. Both male and female laborers could be subject to violence, occasionally even resulting in death. Richard Hofstadter notes that, as slaves arrived in greater numbers after 1700, white laborers in Virginia became a \\"privileged stratum, assigned to lighter work and more skilled tasks\\". He also notes that \\"Runaways were regularly advertised in the newspapers, rewards were offered, and both sheriffs and the general public were enlisted to secure their return. ... The standard penalty in the North, not always rigorously enforced, was extra service of twice the time the master had lost, though whipping was also common.\\"White Servitude , by Richard Hofstadter Redemptioner profile Indentured servitude was a method of increasing the number of colonists, especially in the English and later British colonies. Voluntary migration and convict labor only provided so many people, and since the journey across the Atlantic was dangerous, other means of encouraging settlement were necessary. Contract-laborers became an important group of people and so numerous that the United States Constitution counted them specifically in appointing representatives: Displaced from their land and unable to find work in the cities, many of these people signed contracts of indenture and took passage to the Americas. In Massachusetts, religious instruction in the Puritan way of life was often part of the condition of indenture, and people tended to live in towns. The labor-intensive cash crop of tobacco was farmed in the American South by indentured laborers in the 17th and 18th centuries. Indentured servitude was not the same as the apprenticeship system by which skilled trades were taught, but similarities do exist between the two, since both require a set period of work. The majority of Virginians were Anglican, not Puritan, and while religion did play a large role in everyday lives, the culture was more commercially based. In the Chesapeake and North Carolina, tobacco constituted a major percentage of the total agricultural output. In the Deep South (mainly Georgia and South Carolina), cotton and rice plantations dominated. In the lower Atlantic colonies where tobacco was the main cash crop, the majority of labor that indentured servants performed was related to field work. In this situation, social isolation could increase the possibilities for both direct and indirect abuse, as could lengthy, demanding labor in the tobacco fields. The system was still widely practiced in the 1780s, picking up immediately after a hiatus during the American Revolution. Fernand Braudel (The Perspective of the World 1984, pp. 405ff) instances a 1783 report on \\"the import trade from Ireland\\" and its large profits to a ship owner or a captain, who: In modern terms, the shipowner was acting as a contractor, hiring out his laborers. Such circumstances affected the treatment a captain gave his valuable human cargo. After indentures were forbidden, the passage had to be prepaid, giving rise to the inhumane conditions of Irish 'coffin ships' in the second half of the 19th century.Jackson, Pauline (1984). \\"Women in 19th Century Irish Emigration\\" Southern New England Native Americans and indenture Starting in the late 17th century, in southern New England and parts of Long Island, Native Americans were increasingly pulled into an exploitative debt-peonage system designed to control and assimilate Native American people into the dominant culture as well as channel their labor into the market-based Atlantic economy.The literature on New England Native American indenture, while relatively new is actually vast and growing.

Following King Philip's War (1675–1676) most Native Americans in the region were resigned to reservations or lived in increasingly marginal enclaves on the edges of colonial towns. Due to restricted access to resources, land loss, and changes to the environment caused by European settlement, many Native Americans, especially coastal groups, could no longer practice traditional subsistence activities and therefore became increasingly dependent on European trade goods—cloth, tools, guns, alcohol, and increasingly, food. Merchants trading these items to Native Americans often inflated the cost and, based on a predatory lending scheme, advanced them credit for these purchases, knowing full well most Native Americans would not be able to repay the debts. Eventually when debts mounted, Native Americans were hauled into court by their creditors. When they could not pay either their lands, or more commonly their labor, was seized to settle the debt. Native American debtors were then indentured to their creditors for terms ranging from a few months to sometimes years. Rare cases exist when Native Americans were indentured for a decade or more and a few were enslaved for life (this was quite rare however).Perhaps the largest source of information about these indentures are dozens of debt proceedings against Native Americans in David T. Konig, ed. Plymouth Court Records, 1686–1859, (Wilmington, Del.: Pilgrim Society, 1979–1981); Also important are the contracts reprinted int John Strong, \\"Sharecropping the Sea: Shinnecock Whalers in the Seventeenth Century,\\" in The Shinnecock Indians: A Culture History, edited by Gaynell Stone [Readings in Long Island Archaeology and Ethnohistory, Volume VI] (Lexington, Mass.: Ginn Custom Publishing, 1983), 231–63, and in Philip Rabito-Wyppensenwah, \\"Discovering the Montauketts in Rediscovered Documents,\\" and \\"Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century Native American Whaling on Eastern Long Island,\\" in The History and Archaeology of the Montauk, edited by Gaynell Stone [Readings in Long Island Archaeology and Ethnohistory, volume III] 2nd edition, (Stony Brook, NY: Suffolk County Archaeological Association, 1993), 423–29, 437–44; Other archives containing Native American indenture contracts include contract of Elisha Osborne. Indenture contract, 23 June 1755.

Many Native Americans experienced repeated indentures over the course of their lifetimes, amounting to a phenomenon of 'serial indenture' or debt peonage—multiple short indentures alternating with brief periods of 'freedom.' The 'time' Native American servants owed could be sold or willed to heirs if a creditor died. Assessing how many Native Americans experienced indenture is difficult as exact Native American populations during the colonial period are unknown. However, Historian John Sainsbury was able to document that by the mid-18th century about a third of all Native Americans in Rhode Island were indentured servants living and working in white households. Also, the Massachusetts state archives contains numerous petitions, written from the 1730s to 1760s from Native American tribes in their jurisdiction complaining about abuses in the indenture system and predatory lending by whites. Statutes were eventually passed attempting to regulate practices. Colonial military records do provide some data on Native American indenture as well. Enlistment records from 1704 to 1726 show that almost two-thirds of Native Americans who joined the army were indentured at the time of their enlistment. Records from 1748 to 1760 show a decline in this rate, but still show almost a third of Native American recruits being bound to white masters at the time of their enlistment. One Connecticut regiment raised in 1746 during King George's War (containing 980 men total) contained 139 Native American men. Almost half of them had signed their wages over to white creditors before being deployed.Sainsbury, \\"Indian Labor in Early Rhode Island\\"; Brian D. Carroll, \\"From Warrior to Soldiers: New England Indians in the Colonial Military,\\" Ph.D. dissertation (University of Connecticut, 2009); Carroll, \\"Savages in the Service of Empire: Native American Soldiers in Gorham's Rangers, 1744–1762,\\" New England Quarterly 85, no. 3 (2012): 383–429. While many Native American men, women and children became servants in New England households, the labor of many adult men was funneled into the whaling industry on Long Island, Rhode Island, Cape Cod and the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, as well as the coast of eastern Connecticut. These whaling indentures were somewhat distinct from normal indenture contracts, and stipulated that Native Americans serve not as servants in white households but instead as crew members on a certain number of whaling voyages or 'seasons' of whaling (typically November through April). Throughout most of the colonial period indentured or heavily indebted Native American whalers were the primary labor force in the early whaling industry. They remained an important source of labor into the Revolutionary and early national era, but as their numbers dwindled and the industry expanded exponentially, they made up a decreasingly small proportion of the labor force.Daniel Vickers, \\"The First Whalemen of Nantucket,\\" William and Mary Quarterly, 3rd ser. 40 (1983): 560–83, and \\"Nantucket Whalemen in the Deep-Sea Fishery: The Changing Anatomy of an Early American Labor Force,\\" Journal of American History 72 (1985): 277–96; Elizabeth A.

Decline Indentured servitude appeared in the Americas in the 1620s and remained in use as late as 1917. The causes behind its decline are a contentious domain in economic history. The end of debtors' prisons may have created a limited commitment pitfall in which indentured servants could agree to contracts with ship captains and then refuse to sell themselves once they arrived in the colonies. Increased lobbying from immigrant aid societies led to increased regulation of the indentured labor market, further increasing the difficulty of enforcing contracts. With less ability to enforce the contracts, demand for indentured servants may have fallen. However, most debtor prisons were still in service when indentured servitude disappeared and many regulations on indentured servitude were put in place well before the practice's disappearance.Grubb Spring 1994: 6 A rise in European per-capita income compared to passage fare during the nineteenth century may also explain the disappearance of indentured servitude. While passage from England to the colonies in 1668 would cost roughly 51 percent of English per-capita income, that ratio would decrease to between 20 and 30 percent by 1841.Galenson 1984: 18 This increase in relative income may have been further supplemented by a demonstrated increase in savings among European laborers, meaning European emigrants would have the capital on hand to pay for their own passage. With no need for transit capital, fewer laborers would have become indentured, and the supply of indentured servants would have decreased.Grubb Dec. 1994: 815Galenson 1984: 22 Labor substitutions may have led employers away from indentured servants and towards slaves or paid employees. In many places, African slaves became cheaper for unskilled and then eventually skilled labor, and most farmhand positions previously filled by indentured servants were ultimately filled by slaves.Galenson March 1981: 47 Wage laborers may have been more productive, since employers were more willing to terminate waged employment. In comparison, firing an indentured servant would mean a loss on the original capital investment spent purchasing the servant's contract.Grubb Spring 1994: 21 Either substitution would lead to a decrease in demand for indentured servitude. An additional problem for employers was that, compared to African slaves, European indentured servants who ran away could not always be easily distinguished from the general white population, so they were more difficult to re-capture. Indentured servitude's decline for white servants was also largely a result of changing attitudes that accrued over the 18th century and culminated in the early 19th century. Over the 18th century, the penal sanctions that were used against all workers were slowly going away from colonial codes, leaving indentured servants the only adult white labor subject to penal sanctions (with the notable exception of seaman, whose contracts could be criminally enforced up to the 20th century). These penal sanctions for indentured laborers continued in the United States until the 1830s, and by this point treatment of European laborers under contract became the same as the treatment of wage laborers (however, this change in treatment didn't apply to workers of color). This change in treatment can be attributed to a number of factors, such as the growing identification of white indented labor with slavery at a time when slavery was coming under attack in the Northern states, the growing radicalism of workers influenced with the rhetoric of the American Revolution, and the expansion of suffrage in many states which empowered workers politically. Penal sanctions, previously considered perfectly in line with free labor, became in the 19th century a way to transform ordinary labor into \\"contracts of slavery.\\" =Labor market dynamics= Given the rapid expansion of colonial export industries in the 17th and 18th century, natural population growth and immigration were unable to meet the increasing demand for workers. As a result, the cost of indentured servants rose substantially. In the Chesapeake Bay, for example, the cost of indentures rose as much as 60% in the 1680s. The increase in the price of indentures did not however act as an incentive for European workers to emigrate for they were not affected by the price at which they were sold in American ports. As a result, the companies that generated indentures disrupted the price signaling effect and thus the supply of immigrants did not expand sufficiently to meet demand. Some actors in the market attempted to generate incentives for workers by shortening the length of indenture contracts based on the productivity of the prospective emigrant. Some American firms also opted to incentivize workers by paying small wages or by negotiating early expiration of indentures. The rising cost of indentured labor and its inelastic supply pushed American producers towards other forms of labor. Slaves were substantially cheaper and the supply of them was more abundant for it was not constrained by the slaves’ willingness to emigrate. Additionally, slave traders were directly incentivized by the price mechanism to expand \\"production\\" (in the form of raiding expeditions), so supply was relatively elastic. Slavery thus was better able to satisfy labor demands in colonies requiring large quantities of unskilled workers (for example plantation colonies in the Caribbean). Indentures however prevailed in colonies that required skilled workers (in which the cost of training a slave was higher than the price differential between a slave and an indentured servant). Alison Smith and Abbott E Smith's analysis of London port records shows how destination of indentured emigrants shifted from the West Indies towards New England as early as the 1660s, supporting the theory that indentured servitude might have declined in some regions because of labor market dynamics. =Affordability of immigration= The rise in the affordability of immigration reduced emigrants’ need for external financing in the form of indentures. David Galenson's analysis on affordability shows that the cost of immigration from Britain to the United States over the course of the 18th century dropped from 50% of per capita income to less than 10%. This is attributable to higher levels of real income in Europe (a result of economic growth in the 18th century) and to a sharp decline in transportation costs. Innovation had a strong impact on the ease and cost of passenger transportation, reducing the need of indentures. The railroad made non-port cities a much cheaper destination for immigrants. The steamboat was not necessarily cheaper than older sailing technologies, but it made transatlantic travel much easier and comfortable, an attractive factor for high-income classes (that could easily afford immigration without indentures). The British Navy's efforts against piracy also reduced transportation costs. Safer seas implied smaller crews (for there was no need to man weapons on board) and also reduced insurance costs (ships were at lower risk of being captured). The composition of immigrants also shifted from single males towards entire families. Single males usually left their homes with little if any savings. Instead, families generally liquidated assets in Europe to finance their venture. =Impact of American Revolution= The American Revolution severely limited immigration to the United States. Economic historians differ however on the long-term impact of the Revolution. Sharon Salinger argues that the economic crisis that followed the war made long-term labor contracts unattractive. Her analysis of Philadelphia's population shows how the percentage of bound citizens fell from 17% to 6% over the course of the war. William Miller posits a more moderate theory, stating \\"the Revolution (…) wrought disturbances upon white servitude. But these were temporary rather than lasting\\". David Galenson supports this theory by proposing that British indentures never recovered, but Europeans from other nationalities replaced them. =Legal deterrence= In 1799 New York State passed the Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery. Existing slaves became indentured servants. That status was finally ended in 1827 and all the indentured obtained full freedom.See \\"African American Voting Rights (go down the page) A number of acts passed by both the American and the British governments fostered the decline of indentures. The English Passenger Vessels Act of 1803, which regulated travel conditions aboard ships, attempted to make transportation more expensive in order to stop emigration. The American abolition of imprisonment of debtors by federal law (passed in 1833) made prosecution of runaway servants more difficult, increasing the risk of indenture contract purchases. In the 19th century, most indentures of this nature occurred in the old Northwest Territory. The permissibility of such indentures centered on the interpretation of \\"involuntary servitude\\" per the 1787 Northwest Ordinance, which declared: The permissibility (or not) of penal sanctions in labor became an issue of \\"fundamental law\\", in which it was questioned whether those sanctions or specific performance enforcements turned indentured servitude into \\"involuntary servitude\\". At the time when the Northwest Ordinance was constructed, white adult servants were still being imported into the United States, and thus, historically, it seems likely that the Ordinance's framers considered indenture to be a form of \\"voluntary\\" servitude. In essence, this means the indentured servant chose to work for someone who bought them something. The Territory of Hawaii was the last place in the United States to widely use indentures, as by 1900 the practice had been abolished in the rest of the country and replaced by alternatives such as the credit-ticket system used to transport Chinese laborers.Cloud, Patricia and David W. Galenson. \\"Chinese Immigration and Contract Labor in the Late Nineteenth Century,\\" Explorations in Economic History 24.1 (1987): 26, 39. Prior to U.S. annexation, indentures were widely used to transport Japanese contract workers to Hawaii for plantation work. In the Hawaiian Organic Act of 1900 the U.S. prohibited further use of indentures in the territory and voided all such existing contracts, thus ending the practice. Caribbean European servants in colonies A half million Europeans went as indentured servants to the Caribbean (primarily the English-speaking islands of the Caribbean) before 1840.Michael D. Bordo, Alan M. Taylor, Jeffrey G. Williamson, eds. Globalization in historical perspective (2005) p. 72Gordon K. Lewis and Anthony P. Maingot, Main Currents in Caribbean Thought: The Historical Evolution of Caribbean Society in Its Ideological Aspects, 1492–1900 (2004) pp. 96–97 Most were young men, with dreams of owning their own land or striking it rich quick, who would essentially sell years of their labor in exchange for passage to the islands. However, forceful indenture also provided part of the servants: contemporaries report that youngsters were sometimes tricked into servitude in order to be exploited in the colonies.Alexandre Olivier Ecquemelin, The History of Buccaneers in America (1853 edition), p. 46 The landowners on the islands would pay for a servant's passage and then provide the servant with food, clothes, shelter and instruction during the agreed term. The servant would then be required to work in the landowner's field for a term of bondage (usually four to seven years). During this term of bondage the servant had a status similar to a son of the master. For example, the servant was not allowed to marry without the master's permission. Servants could own personal property. They could also complain to a local magistrate about mistreatment that exceeded community norms. However, a servant's contract could be sold or given away by his master. After the servant's term was complete he became independent and was paid \\"freedom dues\\". These payments could take the form of land which would give the servant the opportunity to become an independent farmer or a free laborer. As free men with little money they became a political force that stood in opposition to the rich planters.Lewis and Maingot (2004) p. 97 Indentured servitude was a common part of the social landscape in England and Ireland during the 17th century. During the 17th century, British and Irish went to Barbados as both masters and as indentured servants. Some went as prisoners.Population, Slavery and Economy in Barbados, BBC. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms many Scottish and Irish prisoners of war were sold as indentured laborers to the colonies. There were also reports of kidnappings of youngsters to work as servants. After 1660, fewer indentured servants came from Europe to the Caribbean. Newly freed servant farmers, given 25–50 acres of land, were unable to make a living because profitable sugar plantations needed to cover hundreds of acres. However, profit could still be made through the tobacco trade, which was what these small 25-acre farms did to live comfortably. The landowners’ reputation as cruel masters became a deterrent to the potential indentured servant. In the 17th century, the islands became known as death traps, as between 33 and 50 percent of indentured servants died before they were freed, many from yellow fever, malaria and other diseases.A failed settler society: marriage and demographic failure in early Jamaica, Journal of Social History, Vol. 28, No. 1, Autumn, 1994, by Trevor Burnard Indian servants after abolition When slavery ended in the British Empire in 1833, plantation owners turned to indentured servitude for inexpensive labor. These servants arrived from across the globe; the majority came from India where many indentured laborers came from to work in colonies requiring manual labor. As a result, today Indo-Caribbeans form a majority in Guyana, a plurality in Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname, and a substantial minority in Jamaica, Grenada, Barbados, St Lucia and other Caribbean islands.Walton Lai, Indentured labour, Caribbean sugar: Chinese and Indian migrants to the British West Indies, 1838–1918 (1993)Steven Vertovik, \\"Indian Indentured Migration to the Caribbean,\\" in Robin Cohen, ed. The Cambridge survey of world migration (1995) pp. 57–62 The British government finally ended indentures in the Caribbean in 1917 by prohibiting the further transportation of persons from India for purposes of servitude for debt.

Indigo Fox Media, Kubian's New Jersey-based audio/video production company, has recorded artists such as the Emerson String Quartet, the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, members of the NY Philharmonic, New Jersey Symphony, and the Metropolitan Opera, among many others. He is married to violinist JoAnna Farrer. Compositions  Symphonic  = O for a Muse of Fire = In March 2015, the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra premiered Darryl's latest work, O for a Muse of Fire, a concert overture for full orchestra and vocal soloist, based on Shakespeare’s Henry V. The work is dedicated to the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra and its music director, Jacques Lacombe. The soloist for the premiere performances with the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra was former October Project lead singer (and former Sony Classical artist) Mary Fahl. The vocal part is adaptable to different vocal ranges. ;Reception \\"O For a Muse of Fire\\" received positive reviews in its premiere performances. From Broadway World publication: \\"The overall composition is dramatic with flurries of vibrant musicality especially among the violins and brass. ... Mary Fahl has a dramatic, beautiful voice. This is a cinematic composition that builds steadily and majestically. One wishes Kubian had fleshed it out more. He will be a composer to keep one's eye on whether he pursues dramatic or cinema scores or continues in a classical venue.\\" From The Star Ledger: \\"As the composer noted in an articulate pre-performance introduction, the music dealt with the conscience of the king, exploring matters earthly and spiritual and taking on sounds of both warfare and contemplation. ... a cinematic fabric with deep lower strings and soaring brass. Dissonant threads in sustained chords and warlike percussion contrasted warm, meditative passages. In an earthy alto, vocalist Mary Fahl sang passages of Shakespeare text and keened wordlessly in the work's more impassioned moments. A waterphone added an otherworldly tinge before a frenetic rise and the pound of battle drums led to a fittingly heroic conclusion.\\" = 3-2-1 Concerto for Electric and Acoustic Violin and Orchestra = During the 2007–08 season, the NJSO gave the premiere of Kubian’s 3-2-1 Concerto for Electric and Acoustic Violin and Orchestra — an NJSO commission dedicated to then-Music Director Neeme Järvi and NJSO Concertmaster (and soloist) Eric Wyrick. A preview about the Kubian and the new work was featured on NJN's State of the Arts. This NJN segment can be found online here: 3-2-1 on NJN's State of the Arts ;Reception The work was very well received in its premiere, and was subsequently broadcast on WQXR radio. From The Star Ledger review: \\"The piece balances the sort of electronic effects taken for granted in pop music with an open-hearted lyricism redolent of mainstream film scores, as it moves from an evocation of the Big Bang to a pool of idyllic repose to a cyclic, out-the-door rush. ... He [Eric Wyrick] triggered new colors with a pedal board at his feet, shifting from that initial serrated timbre to a sound like a celestial lyre; the violinist also set echoing loops into motion so that he accompanied himself along with the orchestra. The effect was so texturally engaging that one almost wished that Kubian had written a concerto entirely for electric violin (as John Adams did so well recently with \\"The Dharma at Big Sur\\") ... When Wyrick's electric violin soared above the orchestra again in full cry, the sheer lyricism was stirring, the instrument's hot edge searing away any sentimentality into something pure and affecting. ... Listeners seemed to enjoy the experience from the first note, with an attentive excitement in the air that isn't always there.\\" Eric Wyrick performed the work with the Orquesta Sinfónica de Michoacán in Mexico, in October of 2009. A CD of this collaboration was recorded and released. = Other works = Kubian’s The Maestro Waltz, a special 70th-birthday piece for Neeme Järvi, was the featured encore during a number of NJSO concerts; it is also mentioned in Järvi’s biography, The Maestro’s Touch.

Virtually every model has been used. The majority have been commercial models designed and built by Mack with their own components, but they have also designed and built military specification tactical trucks. Military vehicles are rated by payload measured in tons (907 kg). World War I Before the US entered the war the Army had used small numbers of Mack trucks in trials. The commercial AC, designed with US Army input, was introduced in 1916. First purchased by the UK, it was an immediate success in military service.  AC series  The model AC, with its well-known \\"Renault style\\" tapered hood, was introduced in 1916. A 4X2 with chain drive, it was strong, reliable, and worked well in rough terrain. It had a L-head inline 4 cylinder gasoline engine developing . Over 2,500 , , and -ton trucks were built for the UK and US military. The US Army made it the only standard truck over 5 tons.  AP series The model AP, introduced in 1926, was an 8-ton 6x4 similar to but larger than the AC. It had a L-head inline 6 cylinder developing at 2000 rpm. In 1929 the US Army bought them as prime movers and tank carriers.  World War II  In 1940 the British began buying Macks; when the US entered the war all production was for US and Allied militaries. In addition to commercial models Mack also designed and built a large number of tactical trucks. Because of their proprietary, rather than common standard, design, many were exported to US allies. Tank transmissions and marine diesels were also manufactured. By the end of the war Mack had supplied over 32,000 trucks and other components worth over $3,000,000.Data Sheets  E series  The E series was introduced in 1936 as a conventional or cabover 4x2 truck; larger models were also available as semi-tractors. It was a modern design, with a closed cab, roll up windows, and auto type styling. Early models had an EN310 L-head inline 6 cylinder gasoline engine developing . Later models could have the larger EN354 engine developing at 2,620 rpm and at 1,200 rpm. By 1940 the US Army and Marines were using -ton EE dump trucks, EH 5-ton fuel tankers, EHU cabover wreckers, and other specialty vehicles. Early models were standard commercial models, with chrome trim and hubcaps, in 1942 all trucks became plainer. The military model EH was a 5-ton on road 4x2 cargo truck. The EH, EHU (cabover) and semi-tractor models EHT and EHUT had EN354 engines and disc wheels. Early trucks had standard commercial cabs, later open military cabs were used. Of 3,500 EH and 50 EHT built in 1943–1944, over 2,400 were exported to the British.  LMSW  The Mack LMSW 10-ton 6x4 truck, introduced in 1940, was a commercial design heavy duty trucks larger than the E series. The LMSW 10 ton 6x4 chassis was adapted for military wreckers in North Africa. Their EP gasoline OHV I6 developed . They had wide tandem rear axles so oversize 14.00x20 single rear tires could be used. Models 23 (193) and 39 (181) went to the British, models 53 (130) and 57 (160) went to the Canadians. The primary difference between the models was their bodies, Model 57s also had an open cab. They were shipped partially knocked down, with the cab, chassis, and body shipped separately and assembled at their destination. All Model 39s were shipped to India for use in the Far East. The LPSW was a -ton 6x4 dump truck. Intended for the Panama Canal, some were sent to the British for use in the Pacific theater. They had a rear dump body and an open cab with a windshield on the left half only.  NJU  The NJU (G-639) was a military design 5-ton off-road 4x4 semi-tractor used to tow bridging pontoons and equipment. Their L-head inline 6 cylinder gasoline engine developed at 2400 rpm. Unlike most semi-tractors, all but 8 NJUs had a large toolbox behind the cab to carry outboard engines and other tools used in bridge building. 8 NJU-2s were used for communications trailers and had no toolboxes. Several other manufactures built standardized models of similar trucks, so only 700 NJUs were produced in 1941–1942.  NM  The NM was Mack's first tactical military vehicle. A 6-ton off-road artillery prime mover used to tow AA guns and crews. Their EY overhead valve inline 6 cylinder gasoline engine developed . Models 1, 2, and 3 had the enclosed cab from the commercial L-model and commercial tires. Models 5, 6, 7, and 8 (there was no NM-4) had open cabs and military non-directional tires. Other than cabs and tires, NMs had only minor detail differences. Over 8,400 of all models were built in 1940–1944.  NO  The NO series were -ton 6x6 artillery prime movers meant to tow the 155mm \\"Long Tom\\" field gun, 8 inch howitzer, and 240mm howitzer (the 240mm howitzer was two separate loads). They used the same EY overhead valve inline 6 cylinder gasoline engine developing as the NM series. The NO-2, −3, −6, and −7 varied only in details (NO-1, −4, and −5 were single prototypes). 2050 production NOs were built in 1943–1945, all 1097 NO-3 and −6 models were exported.  NR  The NR (G528) was 10-ton 6x4 cargo trucks similar to the L series. An ED inline 6 cylinder diesel engine developed . Originally intended for British use as light tank transporters in North Africa, they had wide rear tandems so that oversize 14.00x20 single tires could be used. 90 NR1 had cabs of the obsolete EX, models NR2 to NR7 had L series cabs, NR8 and later had open cabs. Other differences between models were body types, some components, and minor details. All were exported as partly knocked down, with the chassis, cab, and body shipped separately then assembled at their destination. Unlike most US trucks they had diesel engines, making them valuable for long distance trips. Over 15,000 were built between 1940 and 1944, the most of any series. After the war, several Mack military trucks were purchased as surplus by European owners. In Belgium, the ministry of provision bought 380 Mack NR in order to compensate a truck shortage and the destruction of railways during the war. When the railroads improved, at least 50 Mack NR4D were rebuilt as cab-over buses for the National Vicinal tramway company (SNCV/NMVB) or private contractors. In other countries, surplus Mack NR trucks were also fitted with various bus, truck or van bodies. 1945 to 1965 In the 1950s Mack built US standard tactical trucks, as well as supplying commercial models for non combat roles.  M54 series  The M54 (officially M39) series (G-744) was a standardized military design 5-ton off-road 6x6 chassis, with many models. Continental 6606 overhead valve inline 6 cylinder gasoline engine developing at 2800 rpm was used. In 1952 Mack began building the M51 Dump (4,310), M52 Semi-tractor (1,443), M54 Cargo (1,126), M55 Long cargo (85), and M61 Chassis-cab (107). In 1962 they took part in program to retrofit some of the series with a Mack ENDT 673 turbocharged inline 6 cylinder diesel engine developing at 2100 rpm. Inside two years, after 2,500 conversions, the Army standardized the Continental LDS-465-1A, a turbocharged inline 6 cylinder multifuel engine developing at 2100 rpm.  M123 and M125  The M123 & M125 were standardized military design 10-ton off-road 6x6 semi tractors and artillery prime movers. Designed by Mack, they used many components from the NO series. A LeRoi T-H844 overhead valve V8 cylinder gasoline engine developed at 2600 rpm. Mack built 392 M123s, used with a lowboy trailer to recover and transport tanks, and all 552 M125s, between 1955 and 1957. Later follow-up orders called for 420 M123A1s with a Cummins V8-300 naturally aspirated V8 diesel engine developing at 3000 rpm and torque at 2100 rpm. Mack also retrofitted 210 gasoline engine M123s with the same engine 1965 to 2005 In 1966 the R and similar DM series conventional commercial design were introduced. The US military used many off the shelf models. Both R and DM were available with full-time all wheel drive. Trucks sold overseas were often sold with military options, one of the most popular was the sheet metal hood and fenders (also available on commercial models).  DM400  The DM492S was a 6x4 aircraft refueler. A mid-range Caterpillar 3208 V8 diesel engine developed at 2,800rpm. The US Air Force ordered 1,010 in 1980.  R600  The R611ST was a typical 6x4 commercial design semi-tractor. An ENDT673 turbocharged inline 6-cylinder diesel developed at 2,100rpm.Data Sheets  RM6866RS series The RM6866RS was an 12-ton 6x6 tactical truck. An EM6 Maxidyne turbocharged inline 6 cylinder diesel developed at 1,800rpm. The Australian Army ordered 940 with delivery starting in 1982. They had right- hand drive and were assembled in Australia. Cargo, dump, prime mover, wrecker, fuel tanker, water tanker, bridging, and concrete mixer models were built. The asphalt distributor was a 6x4. The cargo models previously carried one APC of the M113 and M113A1 Variants, however upon the Australian Army upgrading to the M113AS4 variant the APC was too large to be placed on the rear of an RM6866RS Twenty Foot Equivalent Container Units can also be placed onto the vehicle for transport., and some have a self-loading crane between the cab and body. The RM6866RS series of trucks is currently being superseded by the Rheinmetall-Man HX Series of vehicles in service under the Land-121 Project. However a delay in delivery for a number of variants of the new vehicles means that a large number for RM6866RS Vehicles are still in service in 2019. 2005 to 2015 With the end of R/DM production in 2004–2006, the successor Granite series has been offered with military options. Mack is also involved in the Sherpa line of medium armored cars and supplies components for military service.  Granite series  The Mack Granite GU813E is a 6x4 personnel carrier. A MP8 13-Liter turbocharged inline 6 diesel develops and . A semi- tractor, wrecker, fuel tanker and water tanker are offered. The similar Vision is offered as a semi-tractor with sleeper cab. Sherpa The Sherpa Carrier is a 2 to 4-ton (1,814 to 3,629 kg) 4x4 armored cargo truck. A turbocharged inline 4 diesel engine develops at 2300 rpm and of torque at 1200 - 1700 rpm. It is also offered as a 4-door personnel carrier, an open roof model, and a lightweight 105mm howitzer carrier.

The theater's Baroque spire is a replica of the Royal Castle in Warsaw. This article delineates the history of cinema in the United States. Before 1900 In 1893, Eadweard Muybridge gave lectures and projected hand-painted animated images at his Zoopraxigraphical Hall at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. In June 1894, in Richmond, Indiana, Charles Francis Jenkins used his Phantoscope to project his film before an audience of family, friends and reporters. The film featured a vaudeville dancer performing a Butterfly Dance. Jenkins and his new partner Thomas Armat modified the Phantoscope for exhibitions in temporary theaters at the Cotton States Exposition in the fall of 1895. The Phantoscope was later sold to Thomas Edison, who changed the name of the projector to Edison's Vitascope. With the Vitascope, Edison began public showings of his films at Koster and Bial's Music Hall on 34th Street in New York City on April 23, 1896. However, the first \\"storefront theater\\" in the US dedicated exclusively to showing motion pictures was Vitascope Hall, established on Canal Street, New Orleans, Louisiana July 26, 1896—it was converted from a vacant store. A crucial factor was Edison's decision to sell a small number of Vitascope projectors as a business venture in April–May 1896. In the basement of the new Ellicott Square Building, Main Street, Buffalo, New York, Mitchel H. Mark and his brother Moe Mark added what they called Edison's Vitascope Theater (entered through Edisonia Hall), which they opened to the general public on October 19, 1896 in collaboration with Rudolf Wagner, who had moved to Buffalo after spending several years working at the Edison laboratories. This 72-seat plush theater was designed from scratch solely to show motion pictures. Terry Ramseye, in his book, A Million and One Nights (1926) [p. 276], notes that this \\"was one of the earliest permanently located and exclusively motion-picture exhibitions.\\" According to the Buffalo News (Wednesday, November 2, 1932), \\"There were seats for about 90 persons [actually 72] and the admission was three cents. Feeble, flickering films of travel scenes were the usual fare.\\" The theater remained open for two years, making it the first permanent movie theater in the world. The State Theater in Washington, Iowa is the oldest continuously operating movie theater in the world. It showed its first films in 1897, and was inducted into the Guinness Book of World Records on April 21, 2016. It is still in operation as of January 1, 2020.

The Pionier Cinema in Szczecin, Poland An independent cinema in Wetherby, West Yorkshire, UK. 1900–1919 The first permanent motion picture theater in the state of California was Tally's Electric Theater, completed in 1902 in Los Angeles. Tally's theater was in a storefront in a larger building. The Great Train Robbery (1903), which was 12 minutes in length, would also give the film industry a boost. In 1905, John P. Harris and Harry Davis opened a five-cents-admission movie theater in a Pittsburgh storefront, naming it the Nickelodeon and setting the style for the first common type of movie theater. By 1908 there were thousands of storefront Nickelodeons, Gems and Bijous across North America. A few theaters from the nickelodeon era are still showing films today. The 1913 opening of the Regent Theater in New York City signaled a new respectability for the medium, and the start of the two-decade heyday of American cinema design. The million dollar Mark Strand Theatre at 47th Street and Broadway in New York City opened in 1914 by Mitchell Mark was the archetypical movie palace. The ornate Al. Ringling Theatre was built in Baraboo, WI by Al Ringling, one of the founders of the Ringling Bros. Circus, for the then-incredible sum of $100,000. Los Angeles showman Sid Grauman continued the trend of theater-as-destination with his ornate \\"Million Dollar Theater\\", using the same design firm as Ringling. It opened on Broadway in downtown Los Angeles in 1918. In 1915, the tremendous success of The Birth of a Nation helped to establish the supremacy of feature films, which forced the owners of five-cent theaters to increase the ticket price to ten cents or more, then either remodel to provide a more comfortable and pleasant environment or relocate to a bigger and better auditorium, bringing the nickelodeon era to an end.The Nickelodeon's history Post 1920s: the modern era In the next ten years, as movie revenues exploded, independent promoters and movie studios (who owned their own proprietary chains until an antitrust ruling in 1948) raced to build the most lavish, elaborate, attractive theaters. These forms morphed into a unique architectural genre—the movie palace—a unique and extreme architectural genre which boasted a luxurious design, a giant screen, and, beginning in 1953, stereophonic sound. The movie chains were also among the first industries to install air conditioning systems which gave the theaters an additional lure of comfort in the summer period. In 1931, a seat with a pivoted back was designed to allow people to remain seated while other patrons easily passed in front of them. This type of seat became standard in almost all US movie theaters.\\"Theater Chair Has Adjustable Back\\", March 1931, Popular Science bottom of page 34 Several movie studios achieved vertical integration by acquiring and constructing theater chains. The so-called \\"Big Five\\" theater chains of the 1920s and 1930s were all owned by studios: Paramount, Warner, Loews (which owned Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer), Fox, and RKO. All were broken up as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in the 1948 United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. anti- trust case. In the 1970s, \\"adult movie theaters\\" became ubiquitous in some areas. However, the introduction of the low-cost VHS video system for home televisions has decommissioned many porno cinemas as well as many 'second-run' theaters. People can pay to watch movies at home after a few short months following their theatrical release, through cable television or streaming media: pay-per-view (PPV) and video on demand (VOD). Initially, home video contributed to an industry wide slump in the late 1980s (see disruptive technology), not to mention the decline of the 'Dollar Cinema' (where first- run films are pulled from circulation to play at reduced rates for the remainder of their run). The theater industry responded by building larger auditoriums with stadium seating layouts, installing more screens (to allow for more variety and more show times), upgrading sound systems and installing more amenities and higher-quality food and drink. The growing popularity of high-definition television sets, along with HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc players may also contribute to the decline in cinema attendance, although there seems to be little evidence of this at the moment. Movie theater culture in U.S. Movie theaters are associated with dating, popcorn and expensive treats. Intimacy Abandoned theater in North Miami, Florida Usher's uniform, Cinema Museum (London) An usherette tray for selling snacks Sometimes couples go to a movie theater for the additional reason that it provides the possibility of intimacy, where the dark provides some privacy (with additional privacy in the back-row). This kind of intimacy is considered by some a lesser form of public display of affection. Compared with being together in a room without other people, it may also be reassuring for one or both of the couple (and for parents) that the intimacy is necessarily limited. Arm rests pose a hindrance to intimacy for some people. Some theaters have love seats: seats for two without an armrest in the middle. The most modern theaters have movable armrests throughout the theater that when down can hold a food container as well as act as an armrest or partition between the seats and when up allow closer contact between the couple. Some theaters such as the Parkway in Oakland, California have sofas for greater comfort. Foyer area, food and drinks Movie theaters usually sell various snack foods and drinks at retail counters or kiosks. Sometimes it can be a self-service where one pays at the counter till, and/or a coin-operated machine. Sometimes the area of sale is more like a self-service shop or kiosk (it is not suitable for consuming the goods), and one pays at the check-out between the shop and the area with the screens. Foods usually served at movie theaters include popcorn, soft drinks, nachos, hot dogs, ice creams and a wide range of confectionery. At most theaters, people are allowed to select their own sweets (known as \\"pick and mix\\".) The concessions for buying snacks and drinks often represent the theater's primary source of profit (snacks make up 20% of revenue but 40% of profits in the United States theaters, with a box of popcorn generating a profit of 85%) since most of the ticket revenue goes to the film distributor (and onward to the movie studio). Bringing one's own food and drinks may be forbidden (although not always strictly enforced) in order to maintain a captive market, so theaters charge prices often threefold or higher than nearby stores, while popcorn has been marked up 900% according to CNN. Some movie theaters forbid eating and drinking inside the viewing room (restricting such activities to the foyer), while others encourage it by fitting cup holders on the arm rests (on the front side of the arm rests of one's own chair, or the back side of the arm rests in front) and selling large portions of popcorn and soft drinks. According to a report by Time magazine, \\"Theaters, it's been said, are really in the popcorn and candy business. The showing of films is just an excuse to gather a crowd and try to sell them buttery snacks and sugary drinks.\\" This is not a new perspective on the financial importance of food and theaters. Retail is currently a huge area of expansion with many companies in the U.S. offering a wider range of snacks, including hot dogs and nachos. Some movie theaters feature a wider selection than simply snacks and popcorn. These \\"dine-in\\" theaters allow patrons to purchase \\"meals\\" (ranging from pizza slices to hamburgers and more) that can be consumed while watching the movie. Many theaters have embraced the \\"brew and view\\" concept, serving alcoholic beverages, in addition to snacks and popcorn. Some movie theaters such as the Living Room Theaters or Alamo Drafthouse offer full restaurant service at one's seat, though this is not as widespread. McMenamins is a chain of restaurant/brewpub establishments in the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington, many of which have full movie theaters. By the mid 1940s in some smaller theaters popcorn alone was paying the overheads, even sometimes bringing in more revenue than ticket sales. One theater company in Kansas City had about 4000 acres producing popcorn, and an unnamed person commented \\"Find a good popcorn location and build a theater around it.\\"Smith, Andrew F. (1999). Popped Culture: The Social History of Popcorn in America. Univ of South Carolina Press. pp. 119. The health benefits of this cinema food are generally low, and have been debated for years. Owner of Sony Pictures, Michael Lynton, has been one of the chief arguers over this, and has wanted cinemas worldwide to stop providing this junk food and instead provide healthier alternatives, like crudités, smoothies, nuts, granola bars and additive-free air-popped popcorn. Altercations Patrons are typically angered by cellphone use, talking, and other disturbances during the viewing. Although violence in American movie theaters is uncommon, there have been several notable cases of violence that occurred in movie theaters. In 1989, screenings of Harlem Nights across the country lead to gunfire and fistfights. Two people were killed in a shooting in Southfield, Michigan, and a teenage male was killed in a shooting at a theater in Richmond, California. The violence lead to controversy for the movie. In May 1998, eight people were shot and injured in a gang-related attack during a screening of I Got the Hook Up at a theater in Bakersfield, California.Reiss, Randy. Eight shot after 'I Got the Hook Up!' screening, MTV News, May 28, 1998. On December 25, 2008 in Philadelphia, during a screening of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, a 29-year-old man got upset at a loud man in a theater and threw popcorn at his son and shot the man in the left arm.Man shoots talker at movies, police say, CNN, December 27, 2008. The shooter was found guilty of aggravated assault and sentenced to 11 to 23 months of house arrest and 5 years of probation.House arrest for theater shooting, Philly.com, March 3, 2011. A screening of Alice in Wonderland had to be stopped short at the Regal Stadium 14 in Bowie, Maryland due to a fight that occurred over a teenager who constantly put her feet on the chair of a child sitting in front of her. The father of the child had to be escorted out of the theater by local police. On January 13, 2014, a 71-year-old retired police officer shot at a couple who were allegedly texting during a screening of Lone Survivor in Wesley Chapel, Florida. The 43-year-old male victim died soon afterwards. The suspect was charged with second degree murder and attempted murder. Mass shootings On July 20, 2012, during a midnight screening of the film The Dark Knight Rises at a Century movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, James Eagan Holmes perpetrated a mass shooting, killing 12 and injuring 70 others. It was the second-deadliest shooting in Colorado, and had the largest number of casualties of any U.S. mass shooting until the Orlando nightclub shooting. Christian Bale, who plays Batman in the film, visited several victims in the hospital. The shooting also led to threats of violence across other theaters in the county screening The Dark Knight Rises, as well as an increase in security in theaters. Holmes is currently serving a sentence of life without parole. On July 23, 2015, during a screening of Trainwreck, John Houser opened fire at The Grand Theatre in Lafayette, Louisiana, killing two and wounding nine others. He then killed himself.

It was co-produced by the Television Corporation of Singapore and Taiwan's China Television, directed by Hu Mingkai, and starred Chinese actor Vincent Zhao as Fang Shiyu. It was first aired in Singapore on TCS Eighth Frequency (now MediaCorp Channel 8) from late 1999 to early 2000. Plot The series is set in China during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty. The emperor orders Nalan Degang, a Manchu bannerman, to form and lead a secret death squad to eliminate the Great Ming Society, a Yangzhou-based underground movement seeking to overthrow the Qing dynasty and restore the Ming dynasty. The death squad is named \\"Flying Guillotines\\" after the highly dreaded weapon used by its members. Fang Shiyu is the elder son of Fang De, the governor of Yangzhou. He spends his time enjoying life with his best friend, Nalan Dekai, who is Nalan Degang's younger brother. Zhu Lingce, the Black Guardian of the Great Ming Society, is a descendant of the imperial clan of the Ming dynasty. In the past, he had a romantic affair with Miao Cuihua, Fang Shiyu's mother, but chose to give up on her to pursue his quest to overthrow the Qing dynasty. Although Miao Cuihua married Fang De and bore him two sons, she still has romantic feelings for Zhu Lingce. It turns out later that Fang De is actually the White Guardian of the Great Ming Society and he has been secretly using his position as the governor of Yangzhou to help the society in their anti- Qing activities. Fang Shiyu and Nalan Dekai travel to Shaolin Monastery to learn martial arts and master the Yijin Jing. Their friend, Song Tiezhu, succumbs to the temptation of glory and chooses to join Nalan Degang and serve the Qing government as a spy. When Nalan Degang captures Zhu Lingce, Fang Shiyu and his friends break into prison to save him. However, Song Tiezhu betrays them, causes Zhu Lingce to get killed, and exposes Fang De's true identity as the White Guardian of the Great Ming Society. While Fang De is arrested and taken to Beijing, Fang Shiyu manages to escape and he brings along Nalan Dekai, who was injured while helping him, to Shaolin Monastery for treatment. However, Song Tiezhu leads Qing forces to attack Shaolin and capture them. Fang Shiyu defeats Song Tiezhu in a fight and permanently disables him to prevent him from harming others again. The Yongzheng Emperor uses a scheme to create a misunderstanding between Fang De and the Great Ming Society and tricks the society into believing that Fang De betrayed them. Fang De has no choice but to commit suicide to prove his innocence. In the meantime, Fang Shiyu trains hard in martial arts with the aim of seeking justice and avenging his father. He breaks into the Forbidden City and tries to assassinate the Yongzheng Emperor, but ultimately gives up on his quest for vengeance when he realises the best option is to spare the emperor's life because there will be further chaos and bloodshed if a power vacuum is created when the emperor dies.

Through its official statement of beliefs originally released by its first leader Abu Omar al-Baghdadi in 2007 and subsequently updated since June 2014, ISIL defined its creed as \\"a middle way between the extremist Kharijites and the lax Murji'ites\\". Important doctrines of ISIL include its belief that it represents the restoration of the caliphate of early Islam, and that all Muslims are required to pledge allegiance to it;Endtimes Brewing Huffington Post (UK) article by Anne Speckhard, 29 August 2014 that a \\"defiled\\" Islam must be purged of apostasy, often with bloody sectarian killings, that the final Day of Judgment by God is near and will follow the defeat of the army of \\"Rome\\" by ISIL; that a strict adherence to following the precepts \\"established by the Prophet Muhammad and his earliest followers\\" is necessary, surpassing even that of other Salafi groups. Importance Experts disagree on the importance of ideology in ISIL. According to Cole Bunzel, not all members of ISIL are aware of the ideology of the group they support. On the other hand, Princeton scholar Bernard Haykel, who specializes in the study of ISIL, argues that many Western observers fail to understand the passionate attachment of ISIL—including to its rank and file—to religion doctrine: \\"Even the foot soldiers spout\\" Quranic verses \\"constantly. They mug for their cameras and repeat their basic doctrines in formulaic fashion, and they do it all the time.\\" Fawaz A. Gerges also writes \\"researchers have tended to underestimate the power of the Salafi-jihadist ideology\\"—which he identifies as ISIS ideology-\\"at their own peril\\". Names used to describe the group Names used to describe the group or its ideology vary. Sunni militant USA Today writes that \\"The Islamic State is a group of Sunni militants\\" that \\"believes in the strict enforcement of Sharia law.\\" In a conversation with a Western journalist (Thomas L. Friedman), a deputy crown prince of Saudi Arabia (Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud), described ISIL's message to Saudi and other Arab Muslims as: \\"The West is trying to enforce its agenda on you — and the Saudi government is helping them — and Iran is trying to colonize the Arab world. So we — ISIS — are defending Islam.\\" Wahhabi ISIL adheres to global jihadist principles and follows the hard-line ideology of al-Qaeda and many other modern-day jihadist groups. However, other sources trace the group's roots to Wahhabism. The New York Times wrote: > For their guiding principles, the leaders of the Islamic State ... are open > and clear about their almost exclusive commitment to the Wahhabi movement of > Sunni Islam. The group circulates images of Wahhabi religious textbooks from > Saudi Arabia in the schools it controls. Videos from the group's territory > have shown Wahhabi texts plastered on the sides of an official missionary > van. ISIL aims to return to the early days of Islam, rejecting all innovations in the religion, which it believes corrupts its original spirit. It condemns later caliphates and the Ottoman Empire for deviating from what it calls pure Islam, and seeks to revive the original Wahhabi project of the restoration of the caliphate governed by strict Salafist doctrine. Following Salafi-Wahhabi tradition, ISIL condemns the followers of secular law as disbelievers, putting the current Saudi government in that category. According to The Economist, dissidents in the ISIL capital of Raqqa reported (in 2014) that \\"all 12 of the judges who now run its court system ... are Saudis\\". Saudi Wahhabi practices also followed by the group include the establishment of religious police to root out \\"vice\\" and enforce attendance at salat prayers, the widespread use of capital punishment, and the destruction or re-purposing of any non-Sunni religious buildings. Bernard Haykel has described al-Baghdadi's creed as \\"a kind of untamed Wahhabism\\". Alastair Crooke describes ISIS as adopting Wahhabi \\"puritanism,\\" but denying the \\"Saudi Kingdom any legitimacy as founders of a State, as the head of the Mosque, or as interpreter of the Qur'an. All these attributes ISIS takes for itself.\\" Radical Islamist The BBC defines the group's ideology as \\"radical Islamist,\\" that \\"aims to establish a \\"caliphate\\", a state ruled by a single political and religious leader according to Islamic law, or Sharia.\\" Furthermore, the BBC adds that \\"IS members are jihadists who adhere to an extreme interpretation of Sunni Islam and consider themselves the only true believers. They hold that the rest of the world is made up of unbelievers who seek to destroy Islam, justifying attacks against other Muslims and non-Muslims alike.\\" Global Jihadist Australian National Security informs that \\"The Islamic State is an Iraq and Syria-based Sunni extremist group and former al‑Qa'ida affiliate that adheres to the global jihadist ideology.\\" Khawarij Sunni critics, including Salafi and jihadist muftis such as Adnan al-Aroor and Abu Basir al-Tartusi, say that ISIL and related terrorist groups are not Sunnis, but modern-day Khawarij—Muslims who have stepped outside the mainstream of Islam—serving an imperial anti- Islamic agenda. Islamist-fascist Some journalists, historians, writers and opponents of ISIS and totalitarian Islamism in Arabic countries have called ISIS and its self-proclaimed Caliphate's strictly ruled regime \\"Islamofascism\\" (other terms which have also been used are \\"Islamic fascism\\" and \\"Islamist fascism\\").Islamic Fascism. Hamed Abdel-Samad. 2016. Prometheus Books. Similarities exist between the ISIS militias and fascist regimes, namely their structure, their romanticized images of death, their longing for a violent struggle, their glorification of war and sacrifice, their imperialistic goals, their machismo, their brutal war crimes and the methods of torture which they used against their opponents, their hatred of pacifism, and propaganda which mixes messages about \\"spirituality\\" with militant ideals about \\"forging a new man\\" through \\"warfare, action and religious discipline\\", etc, with the ideals and mentality of \\"ur-fascist\\" regimes, and the ideals and mentality of Clerical fascist movements and regimes, for example, WWII.https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/fascist-caliphate-how-islamic- state-mirrored-fascist-political-tactics-through- appealinghttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-liberal-uncanny-isis-_b_8934148 For example, the fanatically extremist Orthodox Christian Romanian fascist Iron Guard movement and the Hungarian extremist Catholic fascist Arrow Cross movement both spread similar messages in order to unite the members of their death squads and paramilitary organizations, boost their morale and school them in ideals about becoming \\"higher\\" men through hardness, war, fanatic religious worship, and motivate them to commit acts of intolerance and brutality against members of other races and anyone else who opposed their ideas. Their methods of \\"punishing\\" non-believers, as well as political and religious opponents, have also been compared. For example, the Iron Guard hanged Jews on meat-hooks in slaughterhouses during pogroms in Bucharest during the 1940s, and it slaughtered them according to Jewish kosher methods and wrote the word \\"kosher\\" on their corpses, including the corpses of schoolchildren, in order to desecrate the victims and their religion.The Holocaust in Romania.

The modern ISIS regime and the old Fascist movements openly advocated genocide, and they also committed genocide against minorities and murdered anyone else who did not conform to their worldview, such as \\"traitors\\" to their faith or country, members of different ethnic groups, people who practiced different religions, atheists, members of progressive or secular groups (for example, socialists and Slavs in Nazi-occupied Europe and Kurds, Yazidis and members of non-religious Syrian groups in ISIS-occupied zones), people who their ideology considered \\"weak\\", \\"decadent\\", \\"pacifist\\", etc (see the Fascist & Nazi idea about \\"purity\\", supermen and subhumans).The Rise of the Islamic State.

In classical Italian Fascism, and the so-called \\"ur-fascist\\" weltanschauung, the belief in performing actions for the sake of actions, the idea that war was a \\"natural place for the worthy man\\" and the belief that conservative and extreme traditionalist values should be defended were all important parts of the movement's ideology and \\"culture of violence\\"; the same contempt for \\"weakness\\", and the glorification/romanticism of engaging in \\"actions that speak louder than words\\" (i.e terrorism and violence) and the belief that going to war is something which \\"the new man\\" should \\"naturally want to do\\" is just as central and important to ISIS' ideology, propaganda and recruiting tactics as it was to those of the European Fascists. Fascism and ISIS' variant of Islamism are ultra traditionalist and they also have goals and dreams of waging war in order to conquer territory and form an \\"empire\\". Fascists want to reconquer territory and restore the glory of the Roman Empire, while ISIS wants to conquer territory and create its own version of a Caliphate. This view which is based on machismo, the desire to rule over conquered lands and cities and impose a harsh regime on others with the right of might is central to both movements' ideologies.Patrick Cockburn.

Fascist and traditionalist writer Julius Evola, a strong supporter of \\"spiritual imperialism\\", tribalism, brutal machismo and what he saw as a strive for a \\"pure soul\\" and \\"higher ideals\\", wrote often about his contempt for \\"the Modern World\\", materialism, progress and its values, and in one of his works which was titled \\"The Metaphysics of War\\", he praised the so-called ancient \\"warrior soul\\" and claimed that he could still find it in the different religions of the world. He praised the Samurai lifestyle, Pagan spiritualism, and the \\"Islamistic warrior-ideals\\" which he believed existed in Islamism. The same simplistic ideas about Islamism were also shared by Heinrich Himmler. Since the rise of ISIS the book has been mentioned by authors and journalists in order to prove the claim that many Fascist thinkers and ISIS all hold the same views on this topic. Tenets and sources Sources Fawaz A. Gerges believes that ISIS has drawn from Salafi-jihadists’ \\"repertoire of ideas and selectively borrowed whatever fits its unique worldview\\"., In particular, he believes ISIL has drawn from three works that share an advocacy of offensive jihad, opposition to any gradualism or political activity, attacking the near enemy not just the far, observing no limits in killing and brutalizing as extreme violence as this is following the way of the prophet (they assert in opposition to the scholarly consensus) and is the best way to bring the enemy to submission. Three works are: *Management of Savagery (Idarat at-Tawahhush). Written under the pseudonym Abu Bakr al-Najji and published online around 2004. The most famous of the three works, it has been described by several journalists and analysts as influential to ISIL, and intended to provide a strategy to create a new Islamic caliphate. Among its important points are that earlier jihadists wasted time on preaching, neglecting killing and destruction. “We must drag all the people to battle and bring the temple down on the heads of everyone\\". After all, “the worst chaotic condition is by far preferable to stability under the system of apostasy”,Najji, Management of Savagery, 4. and even \\"if the whole umma [community of Muslims] perishes, they would all be martyrs\\".Najji, Management of Savagery, p.76; quoted in ... *An Introduction to the Jurisprudence of Jihad by Abu Abdullah al-Muhajjer. According to this interpretation of jihad (also against the consensus of other scholars) \\"killing kuffar and fighting them in their Homeland is a necessity even if they do not harm Muslims\\". It doesn't really matter if enemy killed are combatants or non-combatants because the main reason for \\"killing them and confiscating their property\\" is that \\"they are not Muslims\\".Muhajjer, An Introduction to the Jurisprudence of Jihad, p.32; quoted in ... *The Essentials of Making Ready [for Jihad] by Sayyid Imam al-Sharif, (also known as Abdel-Qader Ibn Abdel-Aziz or Dr. Fadl). This work focuses on hakimiyya or rule of God, and differs somewhat from the others in encouraging attacks on the far as well as near enemy. Its author asserts that jihad against near enemy—anyone who rules by non-sharia law—is fard ayn, an Islamic obligation for every Muslim male 15 and over. Anyone who avoids jihad in the path of God betrays God, Muhammad, and Islam.Ibn Abdel-Aziz, The Essentials of Making Ready, 345 Demands of the Caliphate Having declared itself to be a new Caliphate, and al-Baghdadi to be the new Caliph, ISIL has declared \\"We inform the Muslims that, with the announcement of the caliphate, it has become obligatory for all Muslims to give Bay'ah and support him\\", and \\"O Muslims in all places. Whoso is able to emigrate to the Islamic State, let him emigrate. For emigration to the Abode of Islam is obligatory\\". This hold true for all other jihadi groups including Al-Qaeda which (ISIL believes) has lost its reason for existing independently. Salafi Jihadists such as ISIL believe that only a legitimate authority can undertake the leadership of jihad, and that the first priority over other areas of combat, such as fighting non-Muslim countries, is the purification of Islamic society. For example, ISIS regards the (non-Salafi) Palestinian Islamist Sunni group Hamas as apostates who have no legitimate authority to lead jihad and it regards fighting Hamas as the first step before confrontation with Israel. But ISIS goes further, ordering all jihadists everywhere that they obey and must pledge their loyalty to the commander of the faithful — i.e. their now deceased caliph Abu Bakr al Baghdadi — who had ordered his fighters to \\"split the head\\" and \\"strike the neck\\" of those who do not. That ISIL is serious about this demand for obedience is reflected in its attacks on the Al-Nusra Front in Syria, a group which declined to pledge loyalty to ISIL. The fight has involved \\"wholesale rapes, beheadings and crucifixions\\" and killed \\"thousands of skilled fighters from both sides\\". Offensive Jihad According to Hayder al-Khoei, the central importance of the restoration of the caliphate of early Islam to ISIL's philosophy is symbolized by the Black Standard ISIS has adopted, a variant of the legendary battle flag of Muhammad displaying the Seal of Muhammad within a white circle, with the phrase above it, \\"There is no God but Allah\\".What the ISIS Flag Says About the Militant Group, Time.com article by Ilene Prusher, 9 September 2014 Without a caliphate, there can be no offensive jihad, according to traditional Islamic law. According to jihadist preacher Anjem Choudary, \\"Hitherto, we were just defending ourselves,\\" but now ISIL can fight to the forcible expansion into countries that are ruled by non-Muslims. Waging of war to expand the caliphate is an essential duty of the caliph, so according to its ideological supporters like Anjem Choudary, ISIL is not just allowed to fight offensively but forbidden not to. The work The Management of Savagery describes three stages of jihad. #In stage one (\\"vexation and empowerment\\") the \\"will of the enemy\\" would be broken by destruction of \\"vital economic and strategic targets such as oil facilities and the tourism infrastructure\\". Concentrating security forces to protect these sensitive targets will cause the state to weakened and its powers wither, bringing “savagery and chaos.” Salafi-jihadists would then take advantage of this security vacuum, by launching an all-out battle on the thinly dispersed security forces.Najji, Management of Savagery, p.20 #Once the state has been overthrown, the \\"administration or management of savagery\\" (Idrarat al- Tawhush) will follow. The \\"law of the jungle\\" will prevail and survivors will \\"accept any organization, regardless of whether it is made up of good or evil people,” and jihadis will step in to provide organization, administering sharia law. #The final stage, \\"empowerment\\" (Shawkat al-Tamkeen), will establish the Islamic state, ruled by a single leader who would then unify diffuse and scattered groups and regions of “savagery” in a caliphate.Najji, Management of Savagery, p.50 Despite the enormous suffering and loss of life caused by the forces of jihad, through a mixture of persuasion and coercion, they will (according to Najji) win hearts and minds and gain legitimacy and recognition for Islamic rule. Importance of Salafism Author Graeme Wood has noted the importance of the \\"governing precepts that were embedded in Islam by the Prophet Muhammad and his earliest followers\\", from which ISIL insists it \\"cannot waver\\". > Virtually every major decision and law promulgated by the Islamic State > adheres to what it calls, in its press and pronouncements, and on its > billboards, license plates, stationery, and coins, \\"the Prophetic > methodology,\\" which means following the prophecy and example of Muhammad, in > punctilious detail. While other jihadis are salafist in doctrine, ISIL been more exacting in following early practices by \\"embrac[ing] slavery and crucifixion without apology,\\" as well as a jizya tax on Christians. It has boasted about its enslavement of Yazidi women in its international magazine Dabiq. Of Jihadi- Salafism The ideology of the Islamic State is based on Jihadi-Salafism, \\"a distinct ideological movement in Sunni Islam\\", according to Cole Bunzel of the Brookings Institution and Graeme Wood of The Atlantic. According to their works, and ISIS itself, it unites two streams of Islamic thought that are the original Moslem Brotherhood and Salafism, though ISIL regards the modern Moslem Brotherhood and Hamas as traitors and apostates. \\"We believe that jihad in God's path is an individual obligation, from the fall of al-Andalus until the liberation of [all] Muslim lands, and [that it is an individual obligation] in the presence of a pious person or an impious person.\\" British newspaper The Guardian defines the organisation's ideology as \\"generally viewed as identical to al-Qaida's or the Saudi version of Salafism – adherence to fundamental Islamic tenets.\\" Takfir The Takfir (declaring self- proclaimed-Muslims apostates who must be killed) of large numbers of Muslims has been a point of difference between itself and other jihadis such as Al- Qaeda. ISIL is \\"committed to purifying the world by killing vast numbers of people\\". From about 2003 to 2006, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the head of ISIL predecessor group, al‑Qaeda in Iraq, expanded \\"the range of behavior\\" that could make large number of self-proclaimed Muslims infidels (kafir) -- including \\"in certain cases, selling alcohol or drugs, wearing Western clothes or shaving one's beard, voting in an election—even for a Muslim candidate—and being lax about calling other people apostates\\". One example of the willingness to takfir is a statement not only calling for the revival of slavery (specifically of Yazidi) but takfiring any Muslim who disagreed with that doctrine. > Yazidi women and children [are to be] divided according to the Shariah > amongst the fighters of the Islamic State who participated in the Sinjar > operations … Enslaving the families of the kuffar and taking their women as > concubines is a firmly established aspect of the Shariah that if one were to > deny or mock, he would be denying or mocking the verses of the Koran and the > narrations of the Prophet … and thereby apostatizing from Islam. Importance of violence ISIS has been noted for what many observers have called \\"appalling\\" or \\"horrifying\\" brutality, its release of videos and photographs of beheadings, shootings, caged prisoners being burnt alive or submerged gradually until drowned. Among other effects, the group's mass killings and publicizing of them led to a split between it and Al Qaeda. ISIL's violence is \\"not some whimsical, crazed fanaticism, but a very deliberate, considered strategy\\", according to some analysts, who often quote from the tract Management of Savagery This work asserts that \\"one who previously engaged in jihad knows that it is naught but violence, crudeness, terrorism, deterrence and massacring.\\" While \\"savage chaos\\" is unpleasant it has to be remembered that even \\"the most abominable of the levels of savagery\\" are better \\"than stability under the order of unbelief,\\" i.e. any regime other than ISIL. One observer has described ISIL's publicizing of its mass executions and killing of civilians as part of \\"a conscious plan designed to instill among believers a sense of meaning that is sacred and sublime, while scaring the hell out of fence-sitters and enemies.\\" Another describes it purpose as to \\"break\\" psychologically those under its control \\"so as to ensure their absolute allegiance through fear and intimidation\\", while generating \\"outright hate and vengeance\\" by its enemies. (That this doctrine has been embraced by at least some lower level ISIL fighters would seem to be corroborated by German journalist Jürgen Todenhöfer, an opponent of Western intervention in Iraq who spent ten days embedded with ISIS in Mosul, and noted \\"something that I don't understand at all is the enthusiasm in their plan of religious cleansing, planning to kill the non-believers ... They were talking about hundreds of millions. They were enthusiastic about it ...\\") Eschatology One difference between ISIL and other Islamist and jihadist movements, including al-Qaeda, is the group's emphasis on eschatology and apocalypticism—that is, a belief that the final Day of Judgment by God are near, and specifically, that the arrival of one known as Imam Mahdi is close at hand. It has been described as \\"a major part\\" of ISIL's \\"recruiting pitch.\\" The ISIL caliph, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi and other leaders have depicted themselves as battling the “antichrist” (Al-Masih ad-Dajjal?) according to Fawaz A. Gerges. ISIL believes that it will defeat the army of \\"Rome\\" at the town of Dabiq, in fulfilment of prophecy. Following its interpretation of the Hadith of the Twelve Successors, ISIL also believes that after al-Baghdadi there will be only four more legitimate caliphs. The noted scholar of militant Islamism William McCants writes: Differences with Al-Qaeda Bin Laden believed in Muslim unity (i.e. sectarianism was discouraged) and aimed the war of “vexing and exhausting” at the “far enemy” (United States). ISIL focuses on \\"grievance (heavily grounded in the feelings of a displaced and impoverished rural class)\\" which involve a \\"near enemy\\". In the wake of the fall of Saddam Hussein, not only were Sunni's removed from power but the capital Baghdad and the Iraqi army were ethically cleansed of Sunni. This created a \\"sense of Sunni loss of privilege\\" and power; \\"a deep desire for revenge against “usurpers” specifically the \\"cosmopolitan, affluent elite\\" and \\"above all\\" the Shi’a and Iran. ISIL absorbed the Wahhabist belief that Islam should be \\"cleansed\\" or purged of deviant groups that \\"defiled\\" the religion. Alastair Crooke sees \\"two elements\\" to the difference between ISIL and Al-Qaeda: #ISIL believes the original historic Islamic state was formed by “fighting-scholars” and their armed followers, (which \\"is NOT the conventional reading\\"). #ISIL follows Wahhabi \\"puritanism,\\" while denying the home of that sect (the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) \\"any legitimacy as founders of a State, as the head of the Mosque, or as interpreter of the Qur’an. All these attributes ISIS takes for itself. In its view ISIS itself is the State.\\" Women and sex roles ISIL publishes material directed at women. Although women are not allowed to take up arms, media groups encourage them to play supportive roles within ISIL, such as providing first aid, cooking, nursing and sewing skills, in order to become \\"good wives of jihad\\". A document entitled Women in the Islamic State: Manifesto and Case Study, released 23 January 2015 by the media wing of ISIL's all-female Al-Khanssaa Brigade, (issued in Arabic and not translated by ISIL but by an anti-Islamist Quilliam Foundation) emphasized the paramount importance of marriage and motherhood (as early as nine-years-old) for women. Women should live a life of \\"sedentariness\\", fulfilling their \\"divine duty of motherhood\\" at home: \\"Yes, we say 'stay in your houses,' .....\\" Under \\"exceptional circumstances,\\" women may leave home—doctors, teachers, women studying Islam are exempt from confinement, as are women if they are needed to fight jihad and ordered to do so by religious leaders when there are not enough men around to protect the country from enemy attack. In education, the document author envisions a system where girls complete their formal schooling by age 15. Women are encouraged to study, provided the content is not \\"worldly\\" knowledge, but religious, for example Shari'ah, (Islamic law). The proper Muslim women should not study > these worthless worldly sciences in the farthest mountains and the deepest > valleys, ... She travels, intent upon learning Western lifestyle and sitting > in the midst of another culture, to study the brain cells of crows, grains > of sand and the arteries of fish! If instead she studies fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), \\"there is with no need for her to flit here and there to get degrees and so on, just so she can try to prove that her intelligence is greater than a man's.\\" The treatise decries Western feminism and the blurring of lines between the roles of each sex, which has caused Muslims to forget how to worship God properly. \\"Women are not presented with a true picture of man\\", and men have become emasculated. Equality for women is criticized on the grounds that > Women gain nothing from the idea of their equality with men apart from > thorns ... Under 'equality' they have to work and rest on the same days as > men even though they have 'monthly complications' and pregnancies and so on, > in spite of the nature of her life and responsibilities to their husband, > sons and religion.\\" In practice Women Residents report that the ISIL dress code for women was both very strict and strictly enforced. Shortly after tasking control of Mosul in 2014 residents reported that ISIL distributed from door- to-door a \\"Bill of the City,\\" detailing its plans for governing the city, and declaring that women should wear a \\"wide, loose jilbab, stay in your homes and leave them only in cases of necessity.\\" The dress code was implemented gradually and completed with the requirement that every part of the female body including the eyes be covered in public. Some former female residents complained that this prevented them from such basic tasks as seeing where they were going; or when shopping seeing what they were buying and what change was being given them. Thousands of sets of niqab were distributed to shops in Mosul after the ISIL takeover and decrees ordered that women wear them along with gloves. ISIL billboards gave details of required apparel for women stating that outer gowns should be \\"thick and not reveal what is beneath\\" and should \\"not draw attention.\\" Regulations on dress are enforced by Diwan al- Hisba or \\"morality police\\" who issue citations and confiscate IDs. According to the New York Times, \\"depending on the offense, he was forced to pay a fine, or else either he or his wife was sentenced to a whipping, recent escapees said.\\" In one case a woman resident complained that she was arrested by a vigilant morality police officer who spotted her lifting her veil to let food enter her mouth while on a family picnic. She was sentenced to 21 lashes administered with \\"a cable that had metal spikes on the end\\" and had to be hospitalized afterwards. Men The Diwan al-Hisba also enforced laws on behavior for men in Mosul, who were fining and flogged for infractions such as \\"incorrect beard length, for failure to pray at the sanctioned time, for possession of cigarettes and alcohol\\". Initial reception Following the announcement of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISIL's predecessor) in 2006, there was much celebration on Jihadist websites. A number of popular forums added counters that counted the number of days that had passed since the Islamic state's establishment, with a statement underneath: \\"[a certain number of] days have passed since the announcement of the Islamic State and the [Muslim] community's coming hope…and it will continue to persist by the will of God.\\" However, outside of jihadists online, it was not considered by people as an official state. Abu Umar al-Baghdadi and Abu Hamza al-Muhajir both insisted that the Islamic State of Iraq was not simply a new name for Al Qaeda in Iraq, but was an actual state. When other Iraq-based Salafi factions like the Islamic Army in Iraq refused to recognize it as a state and give it their allegiance, Abu Umar al-Baghdadi called them \\"sinners\\". Criticism U.S. Secretary Of State John Kerry said in a statement that \\"[ISIL] is not Islamic\\", and denied it was a state, instead calling it a terrorist organization. Neither governments nor peoples recognize it as legitimate government.

Propaganda is information that is not impartial and used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts selectively (perhaps lying by omission) to encourage a particular synthesis, or using loaded messages to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information presented. The term propaganda has acquired a strongly negative connotation by association with its most manipulative and jingoistic examples. Pre-modern precedents English Civil War cartoon titled \\"The Cruel Practices of Prince Rupert\\" (1643). Primitive forms of propaganda have been a human activity as far back as reliable recorded evidence exists. The Behistun Inscription (c. 515 BC) detailing the rise of Darius I to the Persian throne is viewed by most historians as an early example of propaganda. The Arthashastra written by Chanakya (c. 350 – 283 BC), a professor of political science at Takshashila University and a prime minister of the Maurya Empire in ancient India, discusses propaganda in detail, such as how to spread propaganda and how to apply it in warfare. His student Chandragupta Maurya (c. 340 – 293 BC), founder of the Maurya Empire, employed these methods during his rise to power.Boesche, Roger. \\"Kautilya's Arthasastra on War and Diplomacy in Ancient India\\", The Journal of Military History 67 (pp. 9–38), January 2003. The writings of Romans such as Livy (c. 59 BC – 17 AD) are considered masterpieces of pro-Roman propaganda. The best- known originator of Roman historiography was Quintus Fabius Pictor (3rd century BCE). His style of writing history defending the Roman state actions and using propaganda heavily eventually became a defining characteristic of Roman historiography. Another example of early propaganda is the 12th-century work, The War of the Irish with the Foreigners, written by the Dál gCais to portray themselves as legitimate rulers of Ireland.

The printing press was invented in approximately 1450 and quickly spread to other major cities around Europe; by the time the Reformation was underway in 1517 there were printing centres in over 200 of the major European cities.Mark U. Edwards, Printing Propaganda and Martin Luther 15; Louise W. Holborn, \\"Printing and the Growth of a Protestant Movement in Germany from 1517 to 1524\\", Church History, 11, no. 2 (1942), 123. These centres became the primary producers of both Reformation works by the Protestant Reformers and anti-Reformation works put forth by the Roman Catholics. During the U.S.'s Colonial period, religious writers and trading companies circulated glowing tracts urging settlement in the Americas, but often left out the risk and perils.Susan A. Brewer, “Propaganda”, in The Oxford Companion to United States History, ed. Paul S. Boyer (Oxford/NY: Oxford University Press, 2001), 625. During the era of the American Revolution, the American colonies had a flourishing network of newspapers and printers which specialized in the topic on behalf of the Patriots (and to a lesser extent on behalf of the Loyalists). The most famous single publication was Common Sense, a 1776 pamphlet by Tom Paine that played a major role in articulating the demand for independence.Russ Castronovo, Propaganda 1776: Secrets, Leaks, and Revolutionary Communications in Early America (2014) excerpt On occasion, outright disinformation was used, as when Benjamin Franklin circulated false stories of atrocities committed by the Seneca Indians in league with the British. Later, The Federalist Papers were written under pseudonyms by three framers of the Constitution in order to influence public support for ratification. In the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars both sides made heavy use of it during military campaigns with media literate. For instance, the Girondists distributed broadsheets among enemy troops offering them rewards for desertion.David Welch, “Introduction: Propaganda in Historical Perspective”, in Propaganda and Mass Persuasion: A Historical Encyclopedia, 1500 to the Present, eds. Nicholas J. Cull et al. (Santa Barbara, Cal.: ABC-CLIO, 2003), xvi. 19th century Propaganda, as generally understood, is a modern phenomenon that emerged from the creation of literate and politically active societies informed by a mass media, where governments increasingly saw the necessity for swaying public opinion in favour of its policies. During the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic era Propaganda was among the first of the Modern Period. A notable example was perhaps during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, where Indian sepoys rebelled against the British East India Company's rule in India. Incidents of rape committed by Indian rebels against English women or girls were exaggerated to great effect by the British media to justify continued British colonialism in the Indian subcontinent. At the time, British newspapers had printed various accounts about English women and girls being raped by the Indian rebels. It was later found that some of these accounts were false stories created to perpetuate the common stereotypes of the native people of India as savages who need to be civilised by British colonialists, a mission sometimes known as \\"The White Man's Burden\\". One such account published by The Times, regarding an incident where 48 English girls as young as 10–14 were supposedly raped by the Indian rebels in Delhi, was criticised as a false propaganda story by Karl Marx, who pointed out that the story was reported by a clergyman in Bangalore, far from the events of the rebellion. In the U.S. prior to the Civil War, slavery proponents and abolitionists both disseminated their ideas through literature and lobbying. Early anti-slavery periodicals included Anti-Slavery Reporter and Freedom's Journal (1827–29), the last attacking the “return to Africa” colonization programs favored by many prominent politicians. Activists such as William Lloyd Garrison and Theodore Dwight Weld were very effective in anti-slavery societies' writings in winning over public opinion. On the pro- slavery side, the Ostend Manifesto (October 18, 1854) made a case for acquiring Cuba as a slave state, as a way of getting around the Missouri Compromise. In the wake of Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), several books were written to bolster the decision. For instance, George Fitzhugh's Cannibals All!, or Slaves Without Masters argued that the master-slave relationship was better than wage-slavery under capitalist exploitation. Another, Frederick A. Ross's Slavery Ordained of God, used divine will to justify slavery and controversially equated slavery to the treatment of women (i.e., both slaves and women are children). Lastly came Augusta Jane Evans Wilson's Macaria; or, Altars of Sacrifice (1864), popular in the North and South, persuasively defended Confederate policy and predicted horrible consequences if the slaves were freed.Martin J. Manning, “Abolitionist Propaganda”, in Encyclopedia of Media and Propaganda in Wartime America, eds. Martin J. Manning & Clarence R. Wyatt (Santa Barbara, Cal.: ABC-CLIO, 2011), 1: 302. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, propaganda techniques became more refined and effective due to, on the one hand, the growth of new communication technologies (e.g. underseas cables, wireless radio, silent motion pictures), and on the other, the development of modern advertising and public relations. Gabriel Tarde's Laws of Imitation (1890) and Gustave Le Bon's The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind (1897) were two of the first codifications of propaganda techniques, which influenced many writers afterward, including Sigmund Freud. Hitler's Mein Kampf is heavily influenced by Le Bon's theories. First World War How Britain Prepared, 1915 film. The first large-scale and organised propagation of government propaganda was occasioned by the outbreak of war in 1914. In the war's initial stages, propaganda output was greatly increased by the British and German governments, to persuade their populace in the justness of their cause, to encourage voluntary recruitment, and above all to demonise the enemy.Winter, Jay M. \\"Propaganda and the Mobilization of Consent.\\" in Winter, ed., The Oxford Illustrated History of the First World War (2014) pp: 216+ Heavy use was made of posters, as well as the new medium of film.Pearl James, ed., Picture this: World War I posters and visual culture (U of Nebraska Press, 2009) Germany At the start of the war, Germany expanded its unofficial propaganda machinery, establishing the Central Office for Foreign Services, which among other duties was tasked with propaganda distribution to neutral nations, persuading them to either side with Germany or to maintain their stance of neutrality. After the declaration of war, Britain immediately cut the undersea cables that connected Germany to the outside world, thereby cutting off a major propaganda outlet. The Germans relied instead on the powerful wireless Nauen Transmitter Station to broadcast pro-German news reports to the world. Among other techniques used to keep up the morale of the troops, mobile cinemas were regularly dispatched to the front line for the entertainment of the troops. Newsreels would portray current events with a pro-German slant. German propaganda techniques heavily relied on emphasising the mythological and martial nature of the Germanic 'Volk' and the inevitability of its triumph. Germany published several newspapers and magazines for the occupied areas. The 'Gazette des Ardennes,' was designed for French readers in Belgium and France, Francophone prisoners of war, and generally as a propaganda vehicle in neutral and even enemy countries. Editor Fritz H. Schnitzer had a relatively free hand, and he tried to enhance his credibility by factual information. He realized until the closing days of the war that it was necessary to produce an increasingly optimistic report to hide the weakening position of the Central Powers in the summer and fall of 1918.Rainer Pöppinghege, \\"Deutsche Auslandspropaganda 1914-1918: Die ‘Gazette Des Ardennes’ Und Ihr Chefredakteur Fritz H. Schnitzer\\" [\\"German foreign propaganda, 1914-18: the 'Gazette des Ardennes' and its editor-in-chief, Fritz H. Schnitzer\\"]. Francia: Part 3 19./20. Jahrhundert (2004) 31#3 pp 49-64. The British made a careful analysis of the German propaganda campaigns. In terms of content, the official propaganda had multiple themes:P. Chalmers Mitchell, Report on the Propaganda Library (British Ministry of information, 1917) reprinted in W. Henry Cook and Edith P Stickney, eds, Readings in European International Relations since 1879 (1931) pp 558-561. A) It proclaimed that German victory was a certainty. B) It explained Germany was fighting a war of defence. C) Enemy atrocities in were denounced, including its starvation plan for German civilians, use of dum dum bullets, and the use of black soldiers. D) The rhetoric exalted Germany's historic mission to promote high culture and true civilization, celebrating the slogan \\"work, order, duty\\" over the enemy's \\"liberty, equality, fraternity.\\" E). It explained that German victory would benefit all of mankind, freeing the seas for all nations, and enabling the downtrodden colonies of the Allies to liberate themselves. F). Germany needed to land to expand, as an outlet for its surplus population, talent, organizing ability, financial capital, and manufacturing output. G). The riches of the world, especially raw materials, controlled by the British and the French, must be disgorged by the enemy to the benefit of Germany. The propaganda designed for the home market included points A through G.David Welch, Germany, Propaganda and Total War, 1914-1918: the sins of omission (2000). Propaganda directed at neutral opinion downplayed D and F, and left out theme G. The Germans realized they needed to appeal to vocal supporters in countries allied with the Central Powers, especially Austria, Bulgaria, and Turkey. They put special emphasis on the Muslim world, using Turkey as their leverage. Much of the propaganda was oriented toward minorities in the Allied countries, as they tried to stir up Muslims in India and Russia and ethnic groups in Eastern Europe, especially the Poles. In prioritizing the goal of destabilizing the enemy, Berlin realized that it was often counterproductive to promote German glories. Other elements that were hostile or indifferent to Germany, especially among the far left and the Muslims, could best be reached through their own spokesman. Hence large sums—upwards of nine tons of gold—were given the Bolsheviks to spread their own anti-tsarist propaganda. Britain British propaganda during World War I — called \\"an impressive exercise in improvisation\\" — was hastily expanded at the beginning of the war and was rapidly brought under government control as the War Propaganda Bureau (Wellington House), under the overall leadership of journalist Charles Masterman. The Bureau began its propaganda campaign on 2 September 1914 when Masterman invited 25 leading British authors to Wellington House to discuss ways of best promoting Britain's interests during the war. Those who attended included William Archer, Arthur Conan Doyle, Arnold Bennett, John Masefield, Ford Madox Ford, G. K. Chesterton, Henry Newbolt, John Galsworthy, Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, Gilbert Parker, G. M. Trevelyan and H. G. Wells. Several of the writers agreed to write pamphlets and books that would promote the government's point of view; these were printed and published by such well-known publishers as Hodder & Stoughton, Methuen, Oxford University Press, John Murray, Macmillan and Thomas Nelson. 1914 \\"Lord Kitchener Wants You!\\" poster After January 1916 the Bureau's activities were subsumed under the office of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. In May 1916 Masterman began recruiting artists, including Muirhead Bone, Francis Dodd, Eric Kennington and others, to paint pictures of the war in France and the home front. In early 1918 it was decided that a senior government figure should take over responsibility for propaganda and on 4 March Lord Beaverbrook, owner of the Daily Express newspaper, was made Minister of Information. The British effort soon far surpassed the German in its quality and ability to sway the public mood both at home and abroad. A variety of propaganda methods were used by the British during the war, with emphasis on the need for credibility. Written forms of distributed propaganda included books, pamphlets, official publications, ministerial speeches or royal messages. They were targeted at influential individuals, such as journalists and politicians, rather than a mass audience.Ibidem, Messinger 1992 Pamphlets were distributed to various foreign countries, primarily the United States: - these pamphlets were academic in tone and factual in nature, distributed through unofficial channels. By 1916, 7 million copies had been circulated by Wellington House in various languages. British propagandists also sought to influence the foreign press, by providing it with information through the Neutral Press Committee and the Foreign Office. Special telegraph agencies were established in various European cities, including Bucharest, Bilbao and Amsterdam, in order to facilitate the spread of information. Recruitment was a central theme of domestic propaganda until the introduction of conscription in January 1916. The most common theme for recruitment posters was patriotism, which evolved into appeals for people to do their 'fair share'. Among the most famous of the posters used in the British Army recruitment campaign of World War I were the \\"Lord Kitchener Wants You\\" posters, which depicted Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener above the words \\"WANTS YOU\\". One major propaganda avenue was the use of atrocity stories. These aimed to mobilise hatred of the German enemy by spreading details of their atrocities, real or alleged, and was used extensively by Britain, reaching a peak in 1915, with much of the atrocities related to Germany's invasion of Belgium.Laurence V. Moyer, Victory Must Be Ours: Germany in the Great War 1914-1918, p 96 Laurence V. Moyer, Victory Must Be Ours: Germany in the Great War 1914-1918, p 97 One of the first significant publications to be produced by the Bureau was the Report on Alleged German Outrages, in early 1915. This pamphlet documented atrocities both actual and alleged committed by the German army against Belgian civilians. Other atrocity stories included the fate of the nurse Edith Cavell and the Sinking of the RMS Lusitania. These had a significant impact both in Britain and in America, making front-page headlines in major newspapers.;; United States Before the United States declared war in 1917, the Woodrow Wilson administration established a propaganda department along similar lines. Propaganda experts Walter Lippmann and Edward Bernays participated in the Committee on Public Information (CPI), which was tasked with swaying popular opinion to encourage enlistment and war bond sales. The CPI deployed posters, films, and provided themes for speeches by \\"four-minute men\\" at public functions, and also encouraged censorship of the American press. The American press played an unwitting role too by relying on daily war news cables controlled by the British government and by spreading false stories of German atrocities in Belgium and German-occupied eastern France supplied by the British as well.John J. Newman & John M. Schmalbach, United States History: Preparing for the Advanced Placement Examination, 2nd edn. (NY: Amsco, 2010), 450. Starting after World War I, propaganda had a growing negative connotation. This was due in part to the 1920 book How We Advertised America: the First Telling of the Amazing Story of the Committee on Public Information that Carried the Gospel of Americanism to Every Corner of the GlobeE.M. Rogers, A History of Communication Study: A Biographical Approach (NY: The Free Press, 1994). in which the impact of the CPI, and the power of propaganda, was over-emphasised. Also, exposure of fact that the atrocity stories were false created public distrust. The CPI was so unpopular that after the war, Congress closed it down without providing funding to organise and archive its papers. The war propaganda campaign of the CPI \\"produced within six months such an intense anti-German hysteria as to permanently impress American business (and Adolf Hitler, among others) with the potential of large-scale propaganda to control public opinion.\\"Alex Carey, Taking the Risk Out of Democracy: Corporate Propaganda versus Freedom and Liberty (Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1997), 22. Russian revolution White propaganda The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a fraudulent anti-Semitic conspiracy text, was first printed in a Black Hundreds newspaper shortly before the Revolution of 1905. It became widely circulated as an explanation for the uprisings. As the 1917 October Revolution unfolded, causing White movement-affiliated Russians to flee to the West, The Protocols was carried along with them and assumed a new purpose. Until then, The Protocols had remained obscure;Cohn, Norman (1967), Warrant for Genocide, The myth of the Jewish world conspiracy and the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion', Eyre & Spottiswoode, . it now became an instrument for blaming Jews for the Russian Revolution. It was a directly political weapon, used against the Bolsheviks who were depicted as overwhelmingly Jewish, allegedly executing the Judeo-Bolshevist \\"plan\\" embodied in The Protocols. The purpose was to discredit communism, prevent the West from recognizing the Soviet Union, and bring about the downfall of Vladimir Lenin's regime. Red propaganda Russian revolutionaries of the 19th and 20th centuries distinguished two different aspects covered by the English term propaganda. Their terminology included two terms: (agitatsiya), or agitation, and , or propaganda, see agitprop (agitprop is not, however, limited to the Soviet Union, as it was considered, before the October Revolution, to be one of the fundamental activities of any Marxist activist; this importance of agit-prop in Marxist theory may also be observed today in Trotskyist circles, who insist on the importance of leaflet distribution). Soviet propaganda meant dissemination of revolutionary ideas, teachings of Marxism, and theoretical and practical knowledge of Marxist economics, while agitation meant forming favourable public opinion and stirring up political unrest. These activities did not carry negative connotations (as they usually do in English) and were encouraged. Expanding dimensions of state propaganda, the Bolsheviks actively used transportation such as trains, aircraft and other means. Joseph Stalin's regime built the largest fixed-wing aircraft of the 1930s, Tupolev ANT-20, exclusively for this purpose. Named after the famous Soviet writer Maxim Gorky who had recently returned from fascist Italy, it was equipped with a powerful radio set called \\"Voice from the sky\\", printing and leaflet-dropping machinery, radio stations, photographic laboratory, film projector with sound for showing movies in flight, library, etc. The aircraft could be disassembled and transported by railroad if needed. The giant aircraft set a number of world records.

Post-war Bernays, a nephew of Freud, who wrote the book Propaganda early in the 20th century, later coined the terms \\"group mind\\" and \\"engineering consent\\", important concepts in practical propaganda work. He wrote:Bernays, Edward. Propaganda (1928) > The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organised habits and > opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those > who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible > government which is the true ruling power of our country. > We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas > suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result > of the way in which our democratic society is organised. Vast numbers of > human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a > smoothly functioning society. The file Century of the Self by Adam Curtis documents the immense influence of these ideas on public relations and politics throughout the last century. Lippmann, in Public Opinion (1922) also worked on the subject, as well as the American advertising pioneer and founder of the field of public relations Edward Bernays, a nephew of Freud, who wrote the book Propaganda early in the 20th century. According to Alex Carey, one distinctive feature of the 20th century was \\"the professionalising and institutionalising of propaganda\\", as it became an increasingly prominent, sophisticated, and self-conscious tactic of both government and business.\\"Conspiracy Or Groundswell?\\", in Ken Coghill and McPhee Gribble (eds.), The New Right's Australian Fantasy, Penguin Books 1987, pp. 3–19. Nazi Germany After the defeat of Germany in the First World War, military officials such as Erich Ludendorff suggested that British propaganda had been instrumental in their defeat. Adolf Hitler came to echo this view, believing that it had been a primary cause of the collapse of morale and the revolts in the German home front and Navy in 1918 (see also: Dolchstoßlegende). Later, the Nazis adapted many British propaganda techniques during their time in power. Most propaganda in Germany was produced by the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda. Joseph Goebbels was placed in charge of this ministry shortly after Hitler took power in 1933. All journalists, writers and artists were required to register with one of the Ministry's subordinate chambers for the press, fine arts, music, theatre, film, literature or radio. Hitler met nearly every day with Goebbels to discuss the news, and Goebbels would obtain Hitler's thoughts on the subject. Goebbels then met with senior Ministry officials to pass down the official Party line on world events. Broadcasters and journalists required prior approval before their works were disseminated. Along with posters, the Nazis produced a number of films and books to spread their beliefs. On 13 March 1933, The Third Reich established a Ministry of Propaganda, appointing Joseph Goebbels as its Minister. Goals were to establish external enemies (countries that allegedly inflicted the Treaty of Versailles on Germany - by territorial claims and ethnocentrism) and internal enemies, such as Jews, Romani, homosexuals, Bolsheviks and topics like degenerate art. A major political and ideological cornerstone of Nazi policy was the unification of all ethnic Germans living outside of the Reich's borders under one Greater Germany (e.g. Austria and Czechoslovakia). In Mein Kampf, Hitler made a direct remark to those outside of Germany. He stated that pain and misery were being forced upon ethnic Germans outside of Germany, and that they dream of common fatherland. He finished by stating they needed to fight for one's nationality.Hitler, Adolf. Mein Kampf. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1999 Throughout Mein Kampf, he pushed Germans worldwide to make the struggle for political power and independence their main focus. Nazi propaganda used the Heim ins Reich policy for this, which began in 1938. For months prior to the beginning of World War II in 1939, German newspapers and leaders had carried out a national and international propaganda campaign accusing Polish authorities of organizing or tolerating violent ethnic cleansing of ethnic Germans living in Poland. On 22 August, Adolf Hitler told his generals: The main part of this propaganda campaign was the false flag project, Operation Himmler, which was designed to create the appearance of Polish aggression against Germany, which was subsequently used to justify the invasion of Poland.  Nuremberg Laws  In 1935, racist laws in Nazi Germany were introduced known as the Nuremberg Laws, the laws forbade non-Aryans and political opponents of the Nazis from the civil-service and any sexual relations and marriage between people classified as \\"Aryan\\" and \\"non-Aryan\\" (Jews, Gypsies, blacks) was prohibited as Rassenschande or \\"race defilement\\". The Nuremberg Laws were based on notions of racial purity and sought to preserve the Aryan race, who were at the top of the Nazi racial hierarchy and were said to be the ubermenschen \\"herrenvolk\\" (master race), and to teach the German nation to view the Jews as subhumans. Hitler and Nazi propagandists played on the anti-Semitism and resentment present in Germany. The Jews were blamed for things such as robbing the German people of their hard work while themselves avoiding physical labour. Der Stürmer, a Nazi propaganda newspaper, told Germans that Jews kidnapped small children before Passover because \\"Jews need the blood of a Christian child, maybe, to mix in with their Matzah.\\" Posters, films, cartoons, and fliers were seen throughout Germany which attacked the Jewish community. One of the most infamous such films was The Eternal Jew directed by Fritz Hippler.  Political opponents  Soon after the takeover of power in 1933, Nazi concentration camps were established for political opponents. The first people that were sent to the camps were Communists. They were sent because of their ties with the Soviet Union and because Nazism greatly opposed Communism. France in the 1930s France, a democratic society in the 1930s, but the people were kept in the dark about critical issues of foreign policy. The government tightly controlled all of the media to promulgate propaganda to support the government's foreign policy of appeasement to the aggressions of Italy and especially Nazi Germany. There were 253 daily newspapers, all owned separately. The five major national papers based in Paris were all under the control of special interests, especially right-wing political and business interests that supported appeasement. They were all venal, taking large secret subsidies to promote the policies of various special interests. Many leading journalists were secretly on the government payroll. The regional and local newspapers were heavily dependent on government advertising and published news and editorials to suit Paris. Most of the international news was distributed through the Havas agency, which was largely controlled by the government. Radio was a potentially powerful new medium, but France was quite laggard in consumer ownership of radio sets, and the government impose very strict controls. After 1938, stations were allowed only three brief daily bulletins, of seven minutes each, to cover all the day's news. The Prime Minister's office closely supervised the news items that were to be broadcast. Newsreels were tightly censored; they were told to feature none controversial but glamorous entertainers, film premieres, sporting events, high-fashion, new automobiles, an official ceremonies. Motion pictures likely likewise were censored, and were encouraged to reinforce stereotypes to the effect that the French were always lovers of liberty and justice, contending against cruel and barbarous Germans. The government-subsidized films that glorified military virtues and the French Empire. The goal was to tranquilize public opinion, to give it little or nothing to work with, so as not to interfere with the policies of the national government. When serious crises emerged such as the Munich crisis of 1938, people were puzzled and mystified by what was going on. When war came in 1939, Frenchman had little understanding of the issues, and little correct information. They suspiciously distrusted the government, with the result that French morale in the face of the war with Germany was badly prepared.Anthony Adamthwaite, Grandeur and Misery: France’s Bid for Power in Europe 1914-1940 (1995) pp 175-92. Second World War caricatures of Axis leaders. From left- right: Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo. Bataan Death March in American propaganda. World War II saw continued use of propaganda as a weapon of war, building on the experience of WW1, both by Hitler's propagandist Joseph Goebbels and the British Political Warfare Executive, as well as the United States Office of War Information (OWI). Within the US, the British Security Coordination activities worked to counter pro-German sentiment, and isolationist opinion.Nicholas John Cull, Selling War: The British Propaganda Campaign Against American \\"Neutrality\\" in World War II (1995)Susan A. Brewer, To Win the Peace: British Propaganda in the United States During World War II (1997) Because of public distrust following the revelation of false atrocity stories during WW1 and the heavy association of propaganda with the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, the U.S. government referred to its own propaganda effort as a “strategy of truth”, this time using as its main method newsreels and an information format. Enlisting the cooperation of the news media, industry, and Hollywood, the OWI portrayed the war as a contest against democracy and dictatorship, good and evil. While the OWI focused on the home front, the Allies, and neutral countries, the military and the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) engaged in psychological warfare by directing propaganda against the Axis powers. The British broadcast black propaganda through fake German-language radio stations to Europe. It was disguised to sound like legitimate German radio broadcasts, but it had a negative twist designed to undermine German morale. The Germans undertook a similar program. The Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda used English language broadcasts - such as Germany Calling - broadcast to the UK. Presenter William Joyce - a British fascist - gained the nickname \\"Lord Haw-Haw\\" from the popular press.Stanley Newcourt-Nowodworski, Black Propaganda in the Second World War (2005) excerpt and text search In the US, animation became popular, especially for winning over youthful audiences and aiding the U.S. war effort, e.g., Der Fuehrer's Face (1942), which ridicules Hitler and advocates the value of freedom. Some American war films in the early 1940s were designed to create a patriotic mindset and convince viewers that sacrifices needed to be made to defeat the Axis Powers.Philip M. Taylor, 1990, \\"Munitions of the mind: A history of propaganda”, Pg. 170. Others were intended to help Americans understand their Allies in general, as in films like Know Your Ally: Britain and Our Greek Allies. Apart from its war films, Hollywood did its part to boost American morale in a film intended to show how stars of stage and screen who remained on the home front were doing their part not just in their labors, but also in their understanding that a variety of peoples worked together against the Axis menace: Stage Door Canteen (1943) features one segment meant to dispel Americans' mistrust of the Soviets, and another to dispel their bigotry against the Chinese. Cold War propaganda East German communist poster showing the increase of timber production from 7 million cubic metres in 1970 to 11 million in 1990 leaflet bomb\\" during the Korean War. During the Cold War, propaganda became highly ideological rather than tactical, and the rivalry among the United States, Soviet Union, and People's Republic of China generated the most pervasive and intense propaganda seen thus far.Jackson A. Giddens, “Propaganda”, in Encyclopedia Americana (Danbury, Conn.: Scholastic Library Publishing, 2006), 22: 659. All sides used film, television, and radio programming to influence their own citizens, each other, and Third World nations. The United States Information Agency operated the Voice of America as an official government station. Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, which were, in part, supported by the Central Intelligence Agency, provided grey propaganda in news and entertainment programs to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union respectively. The Soviet Union's official government station, Radio Moscow, broadcast white propaganda, while Radio Peace and Freedom broadcast grey propaganda. Both sides also broadcast black propaganda programs in periods of special crises. In 1948, the United Kingdom's Foreign Office created the IRD (Information Research Department), which took over from wartime and slightly post-war departments such as the Ministry of Information and dispensed propaganda via various media such as the BBC and publishing. Its main targets were in the Third World.Death of the department that never was from The Guardian, January 27, 1978 However, it was also set out to \\"be of use to\\" British media and opinion formers. As well as supplying material to the BBC World Service, secret lists were compiled of approved journalists and trade unionists to whom material was offered, if not always accepted. Possibly its most notorious \\"project\\" was the joint operation with the CIA to set up Encounter magazine, edited by Stephen Spender from 1953 to 1966. Spender resigned after it emerged that the Congress for Cultural Freedom, which published the magazine, was being covertly funded by the CIA. The ideological and border dispute between the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China resulted in a number of cross-border operations. One technique developed during this period was the \\"backwards transmission,\\" in which the radio program was recorded and played backwards over the air. (This was done so that messages meant to be received by the other government could be heard, while the average listener could not understand the content of the program). When describing life in capitalist countries, in the US in particular, propaganda focused on social issues such as poverty and anti-union action by the government. Workers in capitalist countries were portrayed as \\"ideologically close\\". Propaganda claimed rich people from the US derived their income from weapons manufacturing, and claimed that there was substantial racism or neo-fascism in the US. When describing life in Communist countries, western propaganda sought to depict an image of a citizenry held captive by governments that brainwash them. The West also created a fear of the East, by depicting an aggressive Soviet Union. In the Americas, Cuba served as a major source and a target of propaganda from both black and white stations operated by the CIA and Cuban exile groups. Radio Habana Cuba, in turn, broadcast original programming, relayed Radio Moscow, and broadcast The Voice of Vietnam as well as alleged confessions from the crew of the USS Pueblo. George Orwell's novels Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four are virtual textbooks on the use of propaganda. Though not set in the Soviet Union, these books are about totalitarian regimes that constantly corrupt language for political purposes. These novels were, ironically, used for explicit propaganda. The CIA, for example, secretly commissioned an animated film adaptation of Animal Farm in the 1950s with small changes to the original story to suit its own needs. During the Cuban Revolution, in 1955 Fidel Castro stressed the importance of propaganda in his struggle both against Fulgencio Batista and the United States, saying, “Propaganda is the heart of our struggle. We must never abandon propaganda.” Vietnam war Pro-South From the beginning of its involvement in Vietnam, the United States government engaged in covert psychological operations. Thomas Anthony Dooley III, a medical intelligence recruit, became the public face of Operation Passage to Freedom, a refugee program secretly designed by CIA officer Edward Lansdale. The refugee surge from North to South appeared spontaneous to the American public, but was partly engineered by Lansdale's hoax threats of dropping nuclear bombs on Hanoi. Although celebrated for independent humanitarian activities, after his death the public learned that Thomas Dooley had been recruited as an intelligence operative by the Central Intelligence Agency, and numerous descriptions of atrocities by the Viet Minh in his book Deliver Us From Evil had been fabricated. Dooley later did similar propaganda work in Laos. Stephen Kinzer, The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and Their Secret World War (Times Books, 2013), p. 195-197 Lansdale went on to run black propaganda operations out of Saigon in collaboration with dictator Ngo Diem. The CIA's forged Communist pamphlets were so convincing they even fooled some of the Viet Minh, and US journalist Joseph Alsop reported Lansdale's disinformation as fact. The agency also manipulated astrology reports in the North in order to negatively effect the morale of the population. Pro- North Propaganda was used extensively by Communist forces in the Vietnam War as means of controlling people's opinions. Radio stations like Radio Hanoi were an integral part of North Vietnamese propaganda operations. Communist Vietnamese politician Mai Chi Tho, commenting on the use of propaganda, stated: > \\"Ho Chi Minh may have been an evil man; Nixon may have been a great man. The > Americans may have had the just cause; we may not have had the just cause. > But we won and the Americans were defeated because we convinced the people > that Ho Chi Minh is the great man, that Nixon is a murderer and the > Americans are the invaders... The key factor is how to control people and > their opinions. Only Marxism–Leninism can do that.\\" U.S. home front On the U.S. home front, information was tightly controlled and the government maintained an upbeat official line about the conduct of the War. However, during the Nixon administration, revelations from the Pentagon Papers and about the My Lai Massacre and the war's expansion into Cambodia and Laos, exposed the government's secrecy and manipulation of information. This led to a “credibility gap” when much evidence contradicted the upbeat official line.Brewer 2001, p. 626. By 1971, more than 70% of those polled thought the U.S. military involvement in Vietnam had been a mistake.George C. Herring, “Vietnam War”, in The Oxford Companion to United States History, ed. Paul S. Boyer (Oxford/NY: Oxford University Press, 2001), 808. Yugoslav wars During the Yugoslav wars, propaganda was used as a military strategy by governments of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Propaganda was used to incite fear and hatred, and particularly incite the Serb population against the other ethnicities (Bosniaks, Croats, Albanians and other non-Serbs). Serb media made a great effort in justifying, revising or denying mass war crimes committed by Serb forces during these wars. According to the ICTY verdicts against Serb political and military leaders, during the Bosnian war, the propaganda was a part of the Strategic Plan by Serb leadership, aimed at linking Serb-populated areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina together, gaining control over these areas and creating a sovereign Serb nation state, from which most non-Serbs would be permanently removed. The Serb leadership was aware that the Strategic Plan could only be implemented by the use of force and fear, thus by the commission of war crimes. Croats also used propaganda against Serbs throughout and against Bosniaks during the 1992-1994 Croat–Bosniak War, which was part of the larger Bosnian War. During Lašva Valley ethnic cleansing, Croat forces seized the television broadcasting stations (for example at Skradno) and created its own local radio and television to carry propaganda. They also seized the public institutions, raised the Croatian flag over public institution buildings and imposed the Croatian Dinar as the unit of currency. During this time, Busovača's Bosniaks were forced to sign an act of allegiance to the Croat authorities, fell victim to numerous attacks on shops and businesses and, gradually, left the area out of fear that they would be the victims of mass crimes. According to ICTY Trial Chambers, in Blaškić case, Croat authorities created a radio station in Kiseljak to broadcast nationalist propaganda. A similar pattern was applied in Mostar and Gornji Vakuf (where Croats created a radio station called Radio Uskoplje). Local propaganda efforts in parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by the Croats were supported by Croatian daily newspapers such as Večernji list and Croatian Radiotelevision, especially by controversial reporters Dijana Čuljak and Smiljko Šagolj, who are still blamed by the families of Bosniak victims in Vranica case for inciting massacre of Bosnian POWs in Mostar when broadcasting a report about alleged terrorists arrested by Croats who victimised Croat civilians. The bodies of Bosnian POWs were later found in Goranci mass grave. Croatian Radiotelevision presented Croat attack on Mostar as a Bosnian Muslim attack on Croats in alliance with the Serbs. According to ICTY, in the early hours of May 9, 1993, the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) attacked Mostar using artillery, mortars, heavy weapons and small arms. The HVO controlled all roads leading into Mostar and international organisations were denied access. Radio Mostar announced that all Bosniaks should hang out a white flag from their windows. The HVO attack had been well prepared and planned. During the ICTY trials against Croat war leaders, many Croatian journalists participated as defence witnesses trying to relativise war crimes committed by Croatian troops against non-Croat civilians (Bosniaks in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbs in Croatia). During the trial against general Tihomir Blaškić (later convicted of war crimes), Ivica Mlivončić, Croatian columnist in Slobodna Dalmacija, tried to defend general Blaškić presenting claims in his book Zločin s pečatom about alleged \\"genocide against Croats\\" (most of it unproven or false), which were considered by the Trial Chambers as irrelevant for the case. After the conviction, he continued to write in Slobodna Dalmacija against the ICTY presenting it \\"as the court against Croats\\", with chauvinistic claims that the ICTY cannot be unbiased because \\"it is financed by Saudi Arabia (Muslims)\\". Propaganda films At the turn of the 20th century, films emerged as the new cultural agents, depicting events and showing foreign images to mass audiences in European and American cities. Politics and film began to intertwine with the reconstruction of the Boer War for a film audience and recordings of war in the Balkans. The new medium proved very useful for political and military interests when it came to reaching a broad segment of the population and creating consent or encouraging rejection of the real or imagined enemy. They also provided a forceful voice for independent critics of contemporary events. The earliest known propaganda film was a series of short silent films made during the Spanish–American War in 1898 created by Vitagraph Studios. At an epic 120 minute running time, the 1912 Romanian Independența României is the first fictional film in the world with a deliberate propagandistic message. Filmed with a budget that would not be reached by a Romanian movie until 1970 (Michael the Brave, supported by the Romanian communist regime also for propagandistic purposes), the movie was meant to shift the perception of the Romanian public towards an acceptance of Romanian involvement into an expected Balkan conflict (the First Balkan War).Cristian Tudor Popescu, Filmul surd în România mută: politică și propagandă în filmul românesc de ficțiune, Polirom, Iași, 2012 Another of the early fictional films to be used for propaganda was The Birth of a Nation (1915). World War I Film was still relatively new to urban audiences with the outbreak of hostilities in 1914. Governments’ use of film as propaganda reflected this. The British and Americans’ initial struggles in the official use of film led to eventual success in their use of the medium. The Germans were off to a faster start in recognising film's value as a tool of perpetuating pro-German sentiment in the US through The American Correspondent Film Company as well as on the front lines with their mobile cinemas, which showed feature films and newsreels. Though the Allied governments were slow to use film as a medium for conveying a desired position and set of beliefs, individuals, such as Charlie Chaplin were considerably more successful with The Bond and Zepped. Interwar period A baby in a carriage falling down the Potemkin Stairs in the iconic scene of The Battleship Potemkin In the years following the October Revolution of 1917, the Soviet government sponsored the Russian film industry with the purpose of making propaganda films. The development of Russian cinema in the 1920s by such filmmakers as Dziga Vertov and Sergei Eisenstein saw considerable progress in the use of the motion picture as a propaganda tool, yet it also served to develop the art of moviemaking. Eisenstein's films, in particular 1925's The Battleship Potemkin, are seen as masterworks of the cinema, even as they glorify Eisenstein's Communist ideals. In depicting the 1905 Russian Revolution Potemkin sought to create a new history for Russia, one led and triumphed over by the formerly oppressed masses. Eisenstein was heavily influenced by the ideology of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, which results in it providing better insight into the mindset of the later revolution than that which it depicted. Its dual purpose beyond forging a national Russian identity was to bring its revolutionary Communist message to the West. Its influence was feared in Germany to the extent that the government banned the film when it was released in the late 1920s. Another of Eisenstein's films, 1927's October, depicted the Bolshevik perspective on the October Revolution, culminating in the storming of the Winter Palace which provided Soviet viewers with the victory that the workers and peasants lacked in Battleship Potemkin, ending with Lenin (as played by an unknown worker) declaring that the government is overthrown. Because no documentary material existed of the storming of the palace, Eistenstein's re-creation of the event has become the source material for historians and filmmakers, giving it further legitimacy as the accepted historical record, which illustrates its success as a propaganda film.Taylor, Richard. Film Propaganda: Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany. London: Croom Helm Ltd., 1979. 92-94, 101. Between the Great Wars American films celebrated the bravery of the American soldiers while depicting war as an existential nightmare. Films such as The Big Parade depicted the horrors of trench warfare, the brutal destruction of villages, and the lack of provisions.Koppes, Clayton, and Gregory Black. Hollywood Goes to War. New York: The Free Press, 1987. 67 Meanwhile, Nazi filmmakers produced highly emotional films about the suffering of the German minority in Czechoslovakia and Poland, which were crucial towards creating popular support for occupying the Sudetenland and attacking Poland. Films like the 1941 Heimkehr (Homecoming) depicted the plight of homesick ethnic Germans in Poland longing to return to the Reich which in turn set the psychological conditions for the real attack and acceptance of the German policy, Lebensraum (living space). World War II In the face of obstacles - COURAGE. Depicting the United States Army in action. SS leader Heinrich Himmler, Adolf Hitler and SA leader Viktor Lutze (from L to R) on the stone terrace. From Triumph of the Will by Leni Riefenstahl Charlie Chaplin in the film The Great Dictator Dutch newsreel by Polygoon-Profilti featuring people swimming (1941) The 1930s and 1940s, which saw the rise of totalitarian states and the Second World War, are arguably the \\"Golden Age of Propaganda\\". Nazi control of the German film industry is the most extreme example of the use of film in the service of a fascist national program and, in 1933, Hitler created the Reich Ministry for People's Enlightenment and Propaganda and appointed the youthful Joseph Goebbels as its head. Fritz Hippler, producer of one of the most powerful propaganda films of the time, 1940's The Eternal Jew (Der ewige Jude), ran the film department under Goebbels. The Eternal Jew purported to be a documentary depicting the Jewish world, insinuating that the Jewish population consisted of avaricious barbarians putting on a front for civilized European society, remaining indifferent and unaffected by the war.Taylor, Richard. Film Propaganda: Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany. London: Croom Helm Ltd., 1979. 190-191. During this time Leni Riefenstahl, a filmmaker working in Nazi Germany, created one of the best-known propaganda films, Triumph of the Will, a film commissioned by Hitler to chronicle the 1934 Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg. Despite its controversial subject, the film is still recognized for its revolutionary approach to using music and cinematography. Another of Riefenstahl's films, 1938's Olympia, was meant to prove that the Reich was a democratic and open society under Nazi rule. It had the perfect venue, the 1936 Berlin Olympics in which to showcase Adolf Hitler's Aryan ideals and prowess. One of the most notable shots is Hitler congratulating the African American Jesse Owens on his four gold medals, whose successes spoiled Hitler's wish to depict those of African descent as racially inferior. The film won a number of prestigious film awards but fell from grace, particularly in the United States when, in November 1938, the world learned of the program against the Jews. Riefenstahl's cinematic masterpiece, though temporarily effective propaganda, was unable to mitigate the growing awareness of the political realities in Nazi Germany. In the United States during World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt recognized that the direct style of propaganda would not win over the American public. He assigned Lowell Mellett to the post of coordinator of government film. Although he had no jurisdiction over Hollywood films, he pressured the industry into helping the war effort. On 13 January 1945, Mellett stated in then-confidential testimony that he was assigned to persuade the film industry to \\"insert morale-building and citizenry arousing themes in its films by all means possible.\\"Culbert, David. Verbatim Testimony. 1945. New York, Washington. Luckily, many directors recognized the necessity (and likely the commercial success they would reap) of supporting the battle against fascism as public opinion lay with the war effort.Thompson, Kristin, and David Bordwell. Film History: An Introduction. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2003. 313. One such filmmaker, Frank Capra, created a seven-part U.S. government- sponsored series of films to support the war effort entitled Why We Fight (1942-5). This series is considered a highlight of the propaganda film genre. Other propaganda movies, such as Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944) and Casablanca (1942), have become so well loved by film viewers that they can stand on their own as dramatic films, apart from their original role as propaganda vehicles. Charlie Chaplin once again joined the U.S. war effort, creating The Great Dictator (1940), in which he played the Hitler-like character of 'Adenoid Hynkel' — this was preceded by some nine months by the short subject starring The Three Stooges, You Nazty Spy!, as Moe Howard was the first American actor (as \\"Moe Hailstone\\") to spoof Hitler in film. Animation became popular, especially for winning over youthful audiences. Walt Disney and Looney Tunes were among those that actively aided the U.S. war effort through their cartoons which provided training and instructions for viewers as well as a political commentary on the times. One of the most popular, Der Fuehrer's Face (1942) was a means of relieving the aggression against Hitler by making him a somewhat comical figure while showcasing the freedom America offered. Disney's Food Will Win the War (1942) attempts to make US citizens feel good by using US agriculture as a means of power.Food Will Win The War, Disney’s World War II Propaganda Film, Chris Durso, Foodiggity, 19 December 2011 (Retrieved 3 February 2012) Also popular in the Soviet Union, the government produced such animated shorts as What Hitler Wants, which depicts a devilish Hitler giving Russian factories to capitalists, enslaving and riding once-free Soviet citizens, but shows that the U.S.S.R. will be prepared to fight, paying the Germans back in triplicate, ready to beat the 'fascist pirates.' Many of the dramatic war films in the early 1940s in the United States were designed to create a patriotic mindset and convince viewers that sacrifices needed to be made to defeat \\"the enemy.\\" Despite fears that too much propaganda could diminish Hollywood's entertainment appeal, reducing its targeted audience and decreasing profits, military enlistment increased and morale was considered to be higher, in part attributed to America's innovative propaganda.Koppes, Clayton, and Black Gregory. Hollywood Goes to War. New York: The Free Press, 1987.Combs, James. Film Propaganda and American Politics. New York: Garland Publishing, 1994. p.54 One of the conventions of the genre was to depict a racial and socioeconomic cross-section of the United States, either a platoon on the front lines or soldiers training on a base, which come together to fight for the good of the country. In Italy, at the same time, film directors like Roberto Rossellini produced propaganda films for similar purposes. Similar to Nazi Germany, the U.S.S.R. prepared its citizens for war by releasing dramas, such as Sergei Eisenstein's iconic Alexander Nevsky. The U.S.S.R also screened films depicting partisan activity and the suffering inflicted by the Nazis, such as Girl No. 217, which showed a Russian girl enslaved by an inhumane German family. Films were shown on propaganda trains while newsreels were screened in subway stations to reach those who were unable to pay to see films in the theater.Rhodes, Anthony. Propaganda: The art of persuasion: World War II. New York: Chelsea House Publishers, 1976. p. 214, 219 Cold War Psychological combat was in fashion during the Cold War, and was used heavily by both sides.Judith Devlin, and Christoph H Muller, eds., War of Words: Culture and the Mass Media in the Making of the Cold War in Europe (2013) When describing life in Communist countries, western propaganda sought to depict an image of a brainwashed citizenry which was then held captive by their government. The CIA's Office of Policy Coordination adapted George Orwell's Animal Farm into an animated movie in 1954 that was released in England.. The entire movie is available through the Internet Movie Database at Animal Farm (1954). In 1951, the American Federation of Labor disseminated a map, entitled \\"'Gulag'--Slavery, Inc.,\\" of the Soviet Union showing the locations of 175 forced labor camps administered by the Gulag. It was widely reprinted across the United States and internationally.Timothy Barney, \\"'Gulag'--Slavery, Inc.': The Power of Place and the Rhetorical Life of a Cold War Map,\\" Rhetoric & Public Affairs (2013) 16#2 pp 317-353. The U.S. government made various anti-communist \\"education\\" documentaries, known as Armed Forces Information Films (AFIF), first shown to the Armed Forces, then released to commercial television or as educational films in schools. They include Communism (1950), Communist Weapon of Allure (1950), Communist Blueprint for Conquest (1956), Red Nightmare (1957), Challenge of Ideas (1961), and Communism (1967). Some were used to portray the American Left as infiltrated by communism, such as Communist Target--Youth (1960), produced by J. Edgar Hoover, which painted the anti-HUAC riots of the 1950s as the work of communism; Anarchy, USA (1966) presents the civil rights movement as a part of a communist plot for world domination. Red Dawn (1984) was a commercial Hollywood film that depicts an alternate 1980s in which the United States is invaded by the Soviet Union, Cuba, Nicaragua, and other Latin American allies of the U.S.S.R. and a group of small-town high school students engage in guerrilla warfare in their resistance of the occupation, eventually beating the communists. Pork Chop Hill (1959) was the most notable 1950s American anti-war propaganda piece about the Korean war. Milestone was known for his previous anti-war films, including 1930's All Quiet on the Western Front and Shangganling (The Battle of Sangkumryung Ridge or Triangle Hill; 1956), which was the most influential film on the Chinese in that era. Both Pork Chop Hill and Shangganling depict a single battle in which a small dedicated unit defends a small holdout with very little hope of reprieve. Like all propaganda the importance of the film is not the battle itself but the outstanding characteristics of such individuals who would commit such acts of patriotism for their home and country.Pickowicz, Paul. \\"Revisiting Cold War Propaganda: Close Readings of Chinese and American Film Representations of the Korean War.\\" Journal of American-East Asian Relations 17.4 (2010): 352. Post-9/11 Over 100 years since its creation, film continues to resonate with viewers and helps influence or reinforce a particular viewpoint. Following the 9/11 attacks, many Americans were split on the success of the government's response and the ensuing war in Afghanistan and Iraq. Similar to the Vietnam War, filmmakers expressed their view of the attacks and feelings about the war through films, most notably, Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004). The film sparked debate across the country, presenting mixed assessments on the role of the U.S. government and its response along with the controversy that normally arises when depicting recent, traumatic events. Director Michael Moore omits footage of the planes striking the Twin Towers, cutting directly to the aftermath and destruction. Alan Petersen's Fahrenhype 9/11 was released in response to Fahrenheit 9/11's success in theaters. Petersen called Fahrenheit 9/11 \\"the Road Runner of manipulation...removing all avenues of thought through over- determination...leaving no room for the viewer's own judgment.\\" It received considerably less press and screentime than Moore's controversial piece. Ayman al-Zawahiri stated that “We are in a media battle for the hearts and minds of our umma [community] of Muslims.” Towards winning the hearts and minds of the MENA region, Al-Qaeda and its affiliates have produced propaganda films and documentaries depicting jihadist attacks, last will and testament videos, training, and interviews, all meant to boost morale among supporters. Al-Qaeda established a Media Committee early in its inception to handle traditional Western and Arab media as well as create an online media presence, which was established through the multi-media company as-Sahab in 2001. The company, which produces documentary-like films and operational videos for Afghanistan is known for its technological sophistication, cinematic effects, and their efforts to reach the west with translations and subtitling. Its operational videos were serialised in Pyre for Americans in Khorasan [Afghanistan]. Other productions in North Africa include Apostate in Hell, a Somali film produced by al-Fajr Media Centre includes interviews with Somali jihadists, training of fighters, preparation for an attack, and actual operations. It along with many other al-Qaeda videos is distributed by Arabic jihadist websites as that community relies on the Internet to a high degree to disseminate information to followers. Food, health, and beyond Elements of propaganda films can also be incorporated into films that have messages that seek to implement positive change within society.Critical Analysis Part 1: Food, Inc., Jen James, WRH 315: Propaganda and You, 23 April 2010 (Retrieved 4 February 2012) However, what one generation may see as positive, later generations may experience as negative. ;Food As mentioned previously, Walt Disney's Food Will Win the War (1942) attempts to make US citizens feel good by using US agriculture as a means of power. In 1943, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) introduced its \\"Basic 7\\" nutrition guide (a precursor to the food pyramid). In the same year, the United States Office of War Information released Food for Fighters about the importance of nutrition in wartime.Food for Fighters, Prelinger Archives at Archive.org (Retrieved 4 February 2012) Between the 1940s and 1970s the Green Revolution increased agriculture production around the world which led to further increases in farm size and a reduction in the number of farms. Advances in fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, antibiotics, and growth hormones, reduced crop wastage due to weeds, insects, and diseases at the expense of health and safety from agricultural pollution. Good Eating Habits (1951) by Coronet Films is a drama focusing on gluttony and \\"hidden hunger,\\" where well- nourished people eat poorly and malnourish themselves.Good Eating Habits, Prelinger Archives at Archive.org (Retrieved 4 February 2012) Miracles From Agriculture (1960) from the USDA presents then supermarkets as the showplaces of agriculture, discussing methods of improvement in the growing, handling, processing, and shipping of food products and the cooperative assistance offered by agricultural and food-processing research centres; the film also hypothesises that a nation grows according to the productivity of its agriculture.Miracles From Agriculture, Prelinger Archives at Archive.org (Retrieved 4 February 2012) Since the 1990s to the present, responses to mad- cow disease, genetically modified foods, flu epidemics in pigs and birds, and an increase in foodborne illness outbreaks, agricultural pollution, and Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) have led people to question where their food comes from and what is actually in it. The use of antibiotics and hormones in cattle and birds, artificial food additives like artificial colors/flavors, artificial sweeteners like high-fructose corn syrup and aspartame, artificial preservatives, etc., prompted \\"propaganda\\" films like Super Size Me (2004),Food Propaganda, Inc., Center for Consumer Freedom, 7 July 2009 (Retrieved 3 February 2012) King Corn (2007), Food, Inc.

A lack of control on the acquired data's use has led to the widespread implementation of workplace propaganda created much more locally by managers in small and large companies, hospitals, colleges and Universities etc. The author highlights the transition of propagandist coming from large, often national producers to small scale production. The same article also notes a departure from the traditional methodology of propagandists i.e., the use of emotionally provocative imagery to distort facts. Data driven propaganda is suggested to use 'distorted data' to overrule emotion. For example, by providing rationales for ideologically driven pay cuts etc. Nations =China= Revolutionary opera with a scene from the Red Detachment of Women. Propaganda is used by the Communist Party of China to sway public and international opinion in favour of its policies. Domestically, this includes censorship of proscribed views and an active cultivation of views that favour the government. Propaganda is considered central to the operation of the Chinese government. The term in general use in China, xuanchuan (宣傳 \\"propaganda; publicity\\") can have either a neutral connotation in official government contexts or a pejorative connotation in informal contexts.Kingsley Edney (2014), The Globalization of Chinese Propaganda: International Power and Domestic Political Cohesion, Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 22, 195. Some xuanchuan collocations usually refer to \\"propaganda\\" (e.g., xuānchuánzhàn 宣传战 \\"propaganda war\\"), others to \\"publicity\\" (xuānchuán méijiè 宣傳媒介 \\"mass media; means of publicity\\"), and still others are ambiguous (xuānchuányuán 宣传员 \\"propagandist; publicist\\").Translations from John DeFrancis, ed. (2003), ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary, University of Hawaii Press, p. 1087. Aspects of propaganda can be traced back to the earliest periods of Chinese history, but propaganda has been most effective in the twentieth century owing to mass media and an authoritarian government. China in the era of Mao Zedong is known for its constant use of mass campaigns to legitimise the state and the policies of leaders. It was the first Chinese government to successfully make use of modern mass propaganda techniques, adapting them to the needs of a country which had a largely rural and illiterate population. In poor developing countries, China spreads propaganda through methods such as opening Confucius Institutes, and providing training programs in China for foreign officials and students. According to Anne-Marie Brady, the Foreign Ministry first set up a system of designated officials to give information in times of crisis in 1983, and greatly expanded the system to lower levels in the mid-1990s. China's spin had been directed only at foreigners, but in the 1990s leaders realised that managing public crises was useful for domestic politics; this included setting up provincial level \\"News Coordinator Groups,\\" and inviting foreign PR firms to give seminars. Brady writes that Chinese foreign propaganda officials took cues from the Blair government's spin doctoring during the mad cow disease crisis of 2000–2001, and the Bush government's use of the U.S. media after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. According to her, the Blair model allows for a certain amount of negative coverage to be shown during a crisis, which is believed to help release some of the \\"social tension\\" surrounding it. She believes information managers in China used this approach during coal mining disasters of 2005. According to Brady, trained official spokespeople are now available on call in every central government ministry, as well as in local governments, to deal with emerging crises; these spin doctors are coordinated and trained by the Office of Foreign Propaganda/State Council Information Office. During the July 2009 Ürümqi riots, Communist Party officials moved swiftly in a public relations campaign. According to Newsweek, Party officials felt that the recent riots risked tarnishing China's global image, and underwent a public relations program involving quickly getting out the government's official version of the events, as well as transporting foreign journalists to riot affected areas. The growth in new technologies, such as email and SMS, forced the CCP's hand into taking up spin. Instead of attempting a media blackout as with the 2008 Tibetan unrest, the Party has adopted a series of more advanced techniques to influence the information leaving China. The day after violence in Ürümqi, the State Council Information Office set up a Xinjiang Information Office in Ürümqi to assist foreign reporters. It invited foreign media to Xinjiang to tour the riot zones, visit hospitals, and look at the aftermath themselves. Journalists were also given CDs with photos and TV clips. \\"They try to control the foreign journalists as much as possible by using this more sophisticated PR work rather than ban[ning] them,\\" according to Professor Xiao Qiang, quoted by Newsweek.Hennock, Mary. \\"Bad Press: The Uighur riots in western China are teaching the government how to spin\\", 7 July 2009 =Mexico= Drug cartels have been engaged in propaganda and psychological campaigns to influence their rivals and those within their area of influence. They use banners and narcomantas to threaten their rivals. Some cartels hand out pamphlets and leaflets to conduct public relation campaigns. They have been able to control the information environment by threatening journalists, bloggers and others who speak out against them. They have elaborate recruitment strategies targeting young adults to join their cartel groups. They have successfully branded the word narco, and the word has become part of Mexican culture. There is music, television shows, literature, beverages, food and architecture that all have been branded narco. =North Korea= Museum of American War Atrocities. Every year, a state-owned publishing house releases several cartoons (called geurim-chaek in North Korea), many of which are smuggled across the Chinese border and, sometimes, end up in university libraries in the United States. The books are designed to instill the Juche philosophy of Kim Il-sung (the \\"father\\" of North Korea)—radical self-reliance of the state. The plots mostly feature scheming capitalists from the United States and Japan who create dilemmas for naïve North Korean characters. DPRK textbooks claim that US missionaries came to the Korean Peninsula and committed barbarous acts against Korean children, including injecting dangerous liquids into the children and writing the word \\"THIEF\\" on the forehead of any child who stole an apple for missionary-owned orchards in Korea. =United States= A poster circa 2000 concerning cannabis in the United States. The National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign, originally established by the National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988,National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988 of the Anti–Drug Abuse Act of 1988, but now conducted by the Office of National Drug Control Policy under the Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998,Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998 (Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999), is a domestic propaganda campaign designed to \\"influence the attitudes of the public and the news media with respect to drug abuse\\" and for \\"reducing and preventing drug abuse among young people in the United States\\".Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998 of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, The Media Campaign cooperates with the Partnership for a Drug-Free America and other government and non-government organizations.Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006, , codified at Anti-smoking campaigns that aired in the United States between 1999 and 2000 were state-sponsored to decrease the amounts of youth smoking. The 'Truth' anti-smoking campaign was created to target 12-17 year old to decrease youth smoking in the United States. February 2004 the 'Truth' anti-smoking campaign started to show up on televised commercials to expose youth of the dangers of tobacco and smoking. The televised campaign used provocative tactics to decrease the amount of youth using tobacco and to change attitudes towards the tobacco industry. In early 2002, the U.S. Department of Defense launched an information operation, colloquially referred to as the Pentagon military analyst program. The goal of the operation is \\"to spread the administrations's talking points on Iraq by briefing ... retired commanders for network and cable television appearances,\\" where they have been presented as independent analysts. On 22 May 2008, after this program was revealed in The New York Times, the House passed an amendment that would make permanent a domestic propaganda ban that until now has been enacted annually in the military authorization bill. The Shared values initiative was a public relations campaign that was intended to sell a \\"new\\" America to Muslims around the world by showing that American Muslims were living happily and freely, without persecution, in post-9/11 America. Funded by the United States Department of State, the campaign created a public relations front group known as Council of American Muslims for Understanding (CAMU). The campaign was divided in phases; the first of which consisted of five mini-documentaries for television, radio, and print with shared values messages for key Muslim countries. =Russia= Vladimir Putin's Russia has been reviving the Soviet-style Propaganda traditions. He stated in April 2005 on national television that the destruction of the USSR was \\"the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century.\\" In 2005 he established \\"Russia Today\\", now called RT, with English, Spanish and Arabic cable news channels financed by the government and designed to function as a \\"soft power\\" tool that will improve Russia's image abroad and counter the anti-Russian bias it sees in the Western media. RT's ruble budget in 2013-14 was equivalent to $300 million US dollars, compared to the $367 million budget of the BBC-World Service Group. RT has an American channel based in Washington, and in 2014 opened a British channel based in London. However the sharp decline in the ruble forced it to postpone channels in German and French. Meanwhile, China and Iran have followed the RT model in launching their own English language channels.\\"Putin's on-air Army\\", TIME 16 March, 2015, pages 44-51 Journalism expert Julia Ioffe argues, RT became an: :extension of former President Vladimir Putin's confrontational foreign policy....It featured fringe-dwelling \\"experts,\\" like the Russian historian who predicted the imminent dissolution of the United States; broadcast bombastic speeches by Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez; aired ads conflating Barack Obama with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad; and ran out-of-nowhere reports on the homeless in America.Julia Ioffe, \\"What Is Russia Today?

Residents and students have been studying ethics and ideology of Ho Chi Minh. Contemporary wars Afghan War In the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, psychological operations tactics were employed to demoralise the Taliban and to win the sympathies of the Afghan population. At least six EC-130E Commando Solo aircraft were used to jam local radio transmissions and transmit replacement propaganda messages. Leaflets were also dropped throughout Afghanistan, offering rewards for Osama bin Laden and other individuals, portraying Americans as friends of Afghanistan and emphasising various negative aspects of the Taliban. Another shows a picture of Mohammed Omar in a set of crosshairs with the words: \\"We are watching.\\" Iraq War Both the United States and Iraq employed propaganda during the Iraq War. The United States established campaigns towards the American people on the justifications of the war while using similar tactics to bring down Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq.Altheide, David L. \\"War and Mass Mediated Evidence.\\" Cultural Studies — Critical Methodologies 9 (2009): 14–22. =Iraqi propaganda= The Iraqi insurgency's plan was to gain as much support as possible by using violence as their propaganda tool.Garfield, Andrew. \\"The U.S. Counter-propaganda Failure in Iraq.\\" Middle East Quarterly 14 (2007): 23–32.

Others used flyers, leaflets, articles and self-published newspapers and magazines to get the point across. Insurgents also produced CDs and DVDs and distributed them in communities that the Iraq and the US Government were trying to influence.Garfield, Andrew. \\"The U.S. Counter-propaganda Failure in Iraq.\\" Middle East Quarterly 14 (2007): 26 The insurgents designed advertisements that cost a fraction of what the US was spending on their ads aimed at the same people in Iraq with much more success. In addition, a domestic Arabic language television station was established with the aim of informing the Iraqi public of alleged coalition propaganda efforts in the country. =US propaganda in Iraq= US PSYOP pamphlet disseminated in Iraq. The pamphlet says: \\"This is your future, Al-Zarqawi\\", and shows Al-Qaeda fighter Al-Zarqawi caught in a rat trap. To achieve their aim of a moderate, pro-western Iraq, US authorities were careful to avoid conflicts with Islamic culture that would produce passionate reactions from Iraqis, but differentiating between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" Islam has proved challenging for the US. The US implemented black propaganda by creating false radio personalities that would disseminate pro-American information, but supposedly run by the supporters of Saddam Hussein. One radio station used was Radio Tikrit. Another example of use of black propaganda is that the United States paid Iraqis to publish articles written by US troops in their newspapers under the idea that they are unbiased and real accounts; this was brought forth by The New York Times in 2005. The article stated that it was the Lincoln Group who had been hired by the US government to create the propaganda. However, their names were later cleared from any wrongdoing. The US was more successful with the Voice of America campaign, which is an old Cold War tactic that exploited people's desire for information. While the information they gave out to the Iraqis was truthful, they were in a high degree of competition with the opposing forces after the censorship of the Iraqi media was lifted with the removal of Saddam from power.Goldstein, Sol. \\"A Strategic Failure: American Information Control Policy in Occupied Iraq.\\" Military Review 88.2 (Mar. 2008): 58–65. In November 2005, the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times alleged that the United States military had manipulated news reported in Iraqi media in an effort to cast a favourable light on its actions while demoralising the insurgency. Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, a military spokesman in Iraq, said the program is \\"an important part of countering misinformation in the news by insurgents\\", while a spokesman for former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said the allegations of manipulation were troubling if true. The Department of Defense confirmed the existence of the program. =Propaganda aimed at US citizens= The extent to which the US government used propaganda aimed at its own people is a matter of discussion. The book Selling Intervention & War, by Jon Western, argued that president Bush was \\"selling the war\\" to the public.Thrall, A.

Video and picture coverage in the news has shown shocking and disturbing images of torture and other evils being done under the Iraqi Government. Russian nationals used different propaganda tools to interfere with the United States 2016 election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Russia created political propaganda for the United States 2016 election to confuse voters from interpreting which news information was false or misleading. Different tactics used to interfere with the United States 2016 included fake social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook, and other cites, false political rallies, and online political advertisements. Russian nationals used new online propaganda which \\"is not to convince or persuade\\", but rather to cause distraction and paranoia. The Select Committee On Intelligence in the United States Senate found that technology aided to providing more convincing and realistic propaganda.

(Some sources indicate the date range August 1–5, to include the event that triggered the violence and the date of the final restoration of the peace.) It was the largest riot in the city's history and one of the largest anti-Greek riots in the world. In the newspapers of the time the events were referred to as the Toronto troubles.Violent August: The 1918 Anti-Greek Riots in Toronto., a Burgeoning Communications Inc. documentary produced, written and directed by John BurryThomas Gallant, George Treheles and Michael Vitopoulos, The 1918 Anti-Greek Riot in Toronto, Thessalonikeans Society of Metro Toronto, 2005, (a summary )YFile: York's Daily Bulletin. 1918 anti-Greek riot a dark episode in Toronto's history. Friday October 22, 2004. The riots were the result of prejudice against new immigrants and the false beliefs that Greeks did not fight in World War I and that they were pro-German.Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples, p. 624 The riots were triggered by news about the expulsion of a crippled veteran, Private Claude Cludernay, from the Greek-owned White City Café on Thursday evening, August 1. Cludernay was drunk and belligerent and struck a waiter, who ejected him and called police. Although the event was insignificant it sparked indignation and violence started on Friday, August 2, when crowds of estimated 5,000–20,000 led by World War I army veterans looted and destroyed every Greek business in sight in the city centre, while the overwhelmed police could not prevent this and just stood by and watched. Due to the scope of the violence, the city mayor had to invoke the Riot Act to call in the militia and military police. On Saturday night, the police and militia were engaged in fierce battles in the downtown to quench the violence. In total, an estimated 50,000 on both sides took part in the riot. Over 20 restaurants were attacked, with damages estimated at more than $1,000,000 in modern (as of 2010) values. After the events, Greek community leaders issued an official statement stating that they support the Allied cause. They stated that those who were naturalized were joining the Canadian army and that there were more than 2,000 Greeks in the Canadian Expeditionary Force (C.E.F.) with many from Toronto, and at least 5 Toronto Greeks had been killed while serving with the C.E.F, and 10 incapacitated. Additionally, at least 135 Toronto Greeks had returned home to join the Greek army against the Central Powers. Many Greek families abandoned the Yonge Street area after the riots, eventually forming a new Greek neighbourhood further East along Danforth Avenue. The riots echoed incidents in the United States where Greek immigrants were attacked and displaced by mobs and even the Ku Klux Klan. The Greek diaspora responded with overt demonstrations of patriotism, such as buying large amounts of war bonds during World War II and changing their names to make them more familiar to North American ears.

Childhood Shimon Sharvit was born in the Tafilalt region of Morocco, son of Eliyahu and Aliza Sharvit on Tamuz 20, 5699 (July 7, 1939), and immigrated to Israel in 1948 with his parents and seven siblings. The family settled in the city of Ramla, and Sharvit studied at the “Sinai” religious state school. His father, who was orphaned at an early age, did not complete his higher education, yet studied Torah and served his entire life as a synagogue cantor and leader in prayer on a voluntary basis. He lived a very long life, enjoying good health and a sound mind, passing away at the age of about 105 years. Sharvit's parents, who wanted him to be a \\"holy vessel\\" (engage in one of the sacred profession - circumciser, ritual slaughterer or Rabbi), made sure he learned the Talmud as well as Jewish slaughtering rules with a Rabbi from the renowned Abu-Hazzera family. Yet his character and personal tendencies directed him towards an entirely different path. From an early age Sharvit dreamed of being a teacher and educator. After a prolonged struggle he transferred to the Netiv Meir Yeshiva in Jerusalem, a step that would not have been possible without the support of the school's Principal and of the Head of the Education Department at the municipality of Ramla, Rabbi Dr. Menachem Frenkel and of his admired educator, Dr. Shlomo Weisblitt. Youth Following his graduation from Netiv Meir Yeshiva, Sharvit enrolled in studies at the Teachers Seminar (of the Jewish Agency) in the Bait VeGan neighborhood of Jerusalem. After completing three years of practical experience in teaching he was awarded a Qualified Teacher diploma. Next, as part of his army service in the Nahal Brigade, he was a youth guide at a Bnei Akiva branch in the town of Kfar Hassidim, and was a teacher and counselor at the Kfar Hanno'ar Haddaty [religious boarding school]. The school's principal, educator Abraham (Eugen) Michaelis, became his spiritual mentor and encouraged him to acquire an academic education. While working in the school, he married Hanna, born Amoyal. He continued his educational work, while Hanna served as the boarding school's house mother. The couple now has three children (Smadar, Benjamin and Noam) and six grandchildren. Academic Studies Sharvit began his academic studies at the Bar-Ilan University in 1963, at the Hebrew Language and Semitic Languages Department (major) and at the Bible Studies Department (minor). His foremost professors included: Yehezkel Kotscher, Geva Zarfati, M. Z. Kadari, Aharon Dotan and Uriel Simon. He completed his master's degree studies with an “outstanding” grade, and his dissertation was granted an “outstanding” grade too. The Yad Avi Ha’ Ýsuv Fund (5729-5730) awarded Sharvit an advanced studies scholarship which funded his stay in England to gain advanced education. Accordingly, he studied general linguistics at the London University and researched numerous manuscripts and archived pieces in British libraries, inter alia at Cambridge University, Bodleian Library at Oxford and the British Museum Library in London. Upon completing his doctorate, Shimon Sharvit was granted a three-year scholarship (1979-1981) by the Bracha Fund (on behalf of the Higher Education Board) to finance his academic position at the Bar-Ilan University and to fund his post-doctorate studies in Boston. Shimon Sharvit later studied Semitic and General Linguistics at Harvard University. Academic Teaching and Research Sharvit was gradually promoted through the ranks at Bar-Ilan University and was appointed Full Professor in 1993. Following almost forty years of teaching, he retired as Professor Emeritus. He taught at the Beit Berl College in 1975-1979 and 1982, and served as Head of the Department of Hebrew Language Studies in addition to teaching as a guest lecturer at the Tel Aviv University, at Brandeis University (Boston), the Hebrew College of Boston and the London Jewish College. His fields of research: Talmudic language (diction, design, syntax and style), Avoth tractate, prayer texts, nontraditional Hebrew punctuation methods in the Middle Ages, linguistic and stylistic means in responsa and other topics related to socio-linguistics. Professor Sharvit has been a full member of the Hebrew Language Academy since 1998, and in recent years has been an active member in its insurance terms committee. Throughout his professional career, he has had many devoted students and researchers who followed him, and has provided guidance and assistance to numerous students during the writing of their theses and doctorates. Some of these students are now lecturers in various universities and colleges. His colleagues and students published a jubilee book in his honor: Articles in the Language of the Sages and Adjacent Fields. The book was edited by Professor Ephraim Hazan and Professor Zohar Livnat, and published jointly by the Bar-Ilan University and the Ashkelon Academic College in 2011. Academic Administration Professor Sharvit managed the Hebrew Expression and the Hebrew Language Teaching units at Bar-Ilan University, and contributed to the studies program in Hebrew Editing (headed by Professor Amazia Porat), founded by Professor Aharon Mirski and Professor Yehuda Friedlander of the Department of Hebrew literature. During the dissertation writing period, Sharvit served as Senior Assistant to the heads of the Department of Semitic and Hebrew Languages (Professors Kadari and Zarfati), and later was himself appointed to head it, a position he held for three years. Sharvit worked over an extended period of time as a researcher at the Institute of Lexicography under the management of its founders, Professor Kotscher and Professor Kadari, later becoming its scientific director. Contribution to the Community and Society Sharvit did not limit himself to academic work in education and research, but contributed extensively to the community and society over many years. He frequently lectured to the general public as part of the activities of a range of social and community organizations. For thirty years, his Ramat Ilan community holds a central place in his life. He lectures before it during Jewish Holy days and during long summer Saturdays and holds a series of classes on diverse subjects, such as: The Bible and its classical commentators, legends, literature of the Sages of Our Blessed Memory, sources of Jewish habits and their development, Jewish thought, Pirkei Avoth, and the Leadership of Maimonides based on his letters. In addition, Professor Sharvit was active in the Morocco Descendant's Alliance organization as well as at the Dahan Center (Center for Society, Culture and Education of the Sephardic Jewry Legacy) affiliated with the Bar-Ilan University, and also headed its academic committee for a number of years. Professor Sharvit was also active as a member of the public administration of the National Library in Jerusalem from 2001 and was later nominated to serve as a member of its Board of Directors (until 2011). Rector of the College The Ashkelon Academic College has played an important role in Professor's Sharvit life for the past twenty years. He was appointed to act as the Academic Head of the Ashkelon Regional College in 1995 and to supervise its studies programs. He became a partner of Dr. Pinchas Haliua, founder and CEO of the College, in all the development steps implemented by the Academic College. Their first steps required them to use extensive means of persuasion with department heads at the University, aimed and receiving their consent to establish full specialization study programs at the College, with an emphasis on prestigious and sought after subjects such as Economics and Psychology. Over time, the regional academy became an academic college. In 2005, upon his retirement from Bar-Ilan University, Professor Sharvit was elected to the position of Vice-President of Academic Affairs at the Ashkelon Academic College (the position's name was recently amended to Rector), and he has devoted most of his time ever since to the academic development of the academic college. Ashkelon Academic College's process of gaining independence from Bar-Ilan University, forced upon it by the Council for Higher Education, which lead to it becoming an independent academic college, has been completed with great success thanks to the dynamic activities and work of its senior management: its President, Professor Moshe Mani, the Rector, Professor Sharvit, and its Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Pinchas Haliua. The Ashkelon Academic College has been awarded authorization to open thirteen independent faculties over the past ten years – an unprecedented achievement, with most of them already being granted accreditation. The Ashkelon Academic College is currently undergoing rapid growth and a process of affirmation of its academic status throughout the country, and is expected to obtain the approval of the Council for Higher Education to launch two additional M.A. degree programs: Criminology and Social Work. Its recently appointed President, Professor Shlomo Grossman has put an emphasis on the development of a new field of studies: Health Sciences. The College's administration is now awaiting approval to launch studies in the first two faculties: Public Health and Nursing. In recent years, Professor Sharvit has initiated cooperation between the Ashkelon Academic College and the Dahan Center at the Bar-Ilan University, headed by Dr. Shimon Ohayon. This cooperation has led to two joint evening of study and discussion held at the college: an annual evening dedicated the subject of From the Seder Evening to the Mimuna (Moroccan Jewry legacy), and the bi-annual evening entitled New Findings in the Research of Yemenite Jewry. The cooperation with the Dahan Center has expanded over the past three years to include international conferences dealing with the topics of Society and Jewry, with six conferences already held in Italy, Brazil, Macedonia, Montreal, Cape Town Publications Books * The language of the Sage [=Unit 3], chapters in the history of the Hebrew language, published by the Open University, 2002. * Avoth Tractate through the Ages: scientific publication, Prolegomena and Appendices, Bialik Institute, Jerusalem 2004. * Language and Style of Tractate Avoth through the Ages, Ben Gurion University, Beer Sheva, 2006. * Research Chapters of the Language of the Sage, Bialik Institute, Jerusalem 2008. * Phonology of the Language of the Sage, the Academy of the Hebrew Language, Jerusalem 2016 * Language and Society – Selected Topics in Classic and Modern Hebrew (under preparation).

It was released on Yahoo! Screen in the United States on March 17, 2015, along with the following episode, \\"Lawnmower Maintenance and Postnatal Care\\". \\"Ladders\\" marks the departure of series regular Yvette Nicole Brown as Shirley Bennett, who left the series to care for her ill father. The episode also marks the first appearance of Paget Brewster as Francesca \\"Frankie\\" Dart as a recurring character. Plot Accumulated weight from Frisbees on the roof of Greendale Community College cause the ceiling of the school's cafeteria to cave in. College Dean Craig Pelton (Jim Rash) is forced to hire administrative consultant Francesca \\"Frankie\\" Dart (Paget Brewster) to help organize and insure Greendale. Although Dart seems to get along with Save Greendale Committee member Abed Nadir (Danny Pudi) and the two form a partnership, she is soon opposed by the other members, including Jeff Winger (Joel McHale), Annie Edison (Alison Brie) and Britta Perry (Gillian Jacobs). The rest of the group doesn't trust her, as they feel she is meddling and that by \\"improving\\" Greendale as much as she is, she will fundamentally alter the school, with Jeff noting \\"How much can you improve Greendale before it stops being Greendale?\\" After Dart calls for the banning of all alcohol on campus (as she cannot properly insure a school that permits alcohol on campus), Shirley's Sandwich Shop in the cafeteria is converted into a secret speakeasy where students and faculty can go for drinks. Despite wanting to work together with Dart and being the only member of the Committee to have befriended her and put his trust in her, Abed is eventually won over by his friends, spending much of his time at the speakeasy. Dart, who has figured out what is going on, resigns from her position as Greendale's administrative consultant after expressing her opinion that the Committee has a negative influence on Abed. In the wake of Dart's resignation, the campus becomes much more laid-back, particularly in openly allowing alcoholic beverages on campus. However, this backfires when Annie and a teacher are accidentally injured in a classroom mishap, and the school discovers that since Dart resigned, the school has no insurance to cover such accidents. Jeff and Abed decide to apologize to Dart, realizing the need for someone like her on campus to keep balance, and are able to convince her to return to her position at Greendale. Dart joins the Save Greendale Committee. Elsewhere, former Save Greendale Committee member Shirley Bennett (Yvette Nicole Brown), who had left Greendale to watch after her ailing father and ended up becoming the personal chef to a troubled detective, saves her new employer (Steven Weber) from an attempted suicide and vows to help him solve the case that left him paralyzed and led to the loss of his wife. The episode ends with a mock television advertisement for a fictional police procedural drama entitled The Butcher and the Baker, which follows the exploits of Shirley and her employer as crime-solving partners. Cultural references The opening sequence flashback featuring Leonard (Richard Erdman) referenced the intro in Dazed and Confused with the song \\"Sweet Emotion\\" by the band, Aerosmith. Leonard's quote \\"Like tears in rain\\" is a quote from the character Roy Batty in the 1982 science-fiction film, Blade Runner. The episode also parodied the overuse of uplifting montages in pop culture, a film-making device that Abed said was \\"a movie apologizing for reality\\". The underground bar (started by the study group to oppose Frankie's mission) where characters dress in 1920s attire and drink alcohol is a reference to the 1920s era response to the Prohibition era when bootleggers surreptitiously traded in alcohol in defiance of the ban. Production In May 2014, Community was canceled by NBC, its original broadcast network. Due to the show's cult status and fanbase, there was considerable speculation that the show would be picked up by another network such as Netflix or Hulu. In June 2014, it was announced that Yahoo! Screen would be producing a sixth season consisting of 13 new episodes, keeping the show's cast and crew intact under show creator and executive producer Dan Harmon. \\"Ladders\\" is the first episode of Community to air on Yahoo! Screen instead of NBC. Harmon stated: > \\"I am very pleased that Community will be returning for its predestined > sixth season on Yahoo. I look forward to bringing our beloved NBC sitcom to > a larger audience by moving it online. I vow to dominate our new > competition. Rest easy, Big Bang Theory. Look out, Bang Bus!\\" Following Yvette Nicole Brown's departure from the series to care for her ill father, the series added two new actors, Paget Brewster as Francesca \\"Frankie\\" Dart, an insurance consultant hired to help repair the school, and Keith David as retired scientist Elroy Patashnik. Brewster and David had both previously appeared on the series in different capacities, with Brewster playing Debra Chambers in Analysis of Cork-Based Networking, and David in a voice-over role as the narrator in Pillows and Blankets. Guest stars Jonathan Banks, who played the criminology professor Buzz Hickey in the fifth season, and John Oliver, who played Professor Duncan, did not return as they were involved in other projects, Better Call Saul and Last Week Tonight, respectively. Production for the series began on November 17, 2014. The presence of the load-bearing columns added in the construction of the new cafeteria was explained by the production moving from the old Paramount Studios set to the new CBS set (which contained these obtruding pillars) to film the sixth season. Harmon stated that the runtime for each episode is \\"flexible\\" due to the lack of the network-controlled commercial breaks and time slot. Harmon added that the change in platform brings with it a creative license to show content that would normally be restricted on a network, qualifying the lack of restriction by saying, \\"It's kind of funny because these regulations aren't being imposed on us by an industry anymore, we're out in the middle of this field, but we're immediately finding these rules on our own anyway.\\" \\"Ladders\\" was filmed and released together with the second episode, \\"Lawnmower Maintenance and Postnatal Care\\". Critical reception \\"Ladders\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode \\"so busy dealing with exposition and meta-commentary about departed actors and changed situations [...] that it doesn't have a ton of room for big laughs, even as it wisely only tries to introduce Paget Brewster's Frankie into the ensemble, saving Keith David's Elroy for \\"Lawnmower Maintenance and Postnatal Care\\".

Player was the first African-American woman to become president of a four-year fully accredited liberal arts college when she took the position at Bennett College for Women in Greensboro, North Carolina. In her career at Bennett College, Player had served as a teacher and then in progressively responsible administrator positions. From 1955 to 1966, Player served as president of the historically black college, during a period of heightened civil rights activism in the South. She supported Bennett students who took part in the lengthy sit-ins started by the Greensboro Four to achieve integration of lunch counters in downtown stores. Player had a strong education, earning a BA degree from Ohio Wesleyan College, a Master's from Oberlin College, a Certificat d'Études at University of Grenoble in France, and a PhD from Columbia University. After leaving the Bennett presidency, Player was appointed in 1966 by President Lyndon B. Johnson as the first female Director of the Division of College Support in the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare, serving until 1986. Background Willa Player, the youngest of three children, was born to Clarence C. and Beatrice (Day) Player in Jackson, Mississippi in 1909. Her family moved to Akron, Ohio, in 1917 when Player was eight years old, as part of the Great Migration in the first half of the 20th century of African Americans to northern and midwestern industrial cities for work and educational opportunities. Growing up in a religious family, Player was active with them in the Methodist church. As a teenager, she spent hours as a member of the youth choir, which aided her pathway to college. Player graduated from West High School in Akron and was accepted in 1925 to Ohio Wesleyan University, a Methodist university. She was one of three African-American students admitted to the college that year. They were not allowed to live in the dorms on-campus, as it was thought special provisions needed to be made for them. Player graduated in 1929. In 1930, Player earned a master's degree from Oberlin College. Academic career In the fall of 1930 at the age of 21, Player was hired to teach Latin and French at Bennett College, a historically black, United Methodist-affiliated college located in Greensboro, North Carolina. Originally founded in 1873 as a coed normal school for training teachers, it had become a women's college in 1926. After teaching at Bennett for a few years, Player took a leave of absence for postgraduate studies. She studied at the University of Grenoble in France, where she received a Certificat d'Études in 1935. College administration Player returned to Bennett College after studying in France. She was selected as Director of Admissions and also served as the Acting Dean. In 1937, freshman student Frances Jones, daughter of the college president, David Dallas Jones, led a civil rights action in Greensboro. Player and R. Nathaniel Dett advised the younger Jones as she led a boycott and protest of segregated movie theaters and racist portrayals in film offerings in downtown Greensboro. Player left Bennett College to pursue her Ph.D., which she received from Columbia University in 1948. Years later, she did post-doctoral studies at the University of Chicago and the University of Wisconsin. After Player returned to Bennett, she was promoted to Coordinator of Instruction and, in 1952, to Vice-President of Bennett College. Jet reported that she was the first person of color to be offered the presidency of Spelman College in Atlanta that year, but chose to stay with Bennett.\\"Dr. Willa Player Named Bennett Vice- President\\", Jet, November 6, 1952, p. 25. Retrieved March 14, 2016. Its president was still David Dallas Jones. In 1955, Player was appointed as acting prehttps://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Willa_Beatrice_Player&action;=editsident when Jones was diagnosed with cancer. Knowing he would not be able to perform his duties, Jones recommended Player to the board of trustees for the president's position at Bennett. In the fall of 1956, Willa Player was inaugurated as the president of Bennett College, the first African-American woman to be selected as president of an accredited, four-year college. In 1957, Player gained accreditation for the college from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Civil rights movement In the postwar period, civil rights organizations increased activism to achieve racial justice and exercise of constitutional rights, including integration of public facilities and the ability for blacks to register and vote in the South. Most blacks in North Carolina and other southern states had been disenfranchised since the turn of the century by laws of white-dominated state legislatures. The activism generated resistance and controversy among those who wanted no change in the Jim Crow social order. Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., leader of the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 and co-founder in 1957 of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference was invited to Greensboro in February 1958 by local African-American clergy and the NAACP. But because of controversy around him, local churches and colleges did not want to host him as a speaker. When Player was asked to host him, she said: \\"Bennett College is a liberal arts college where 'freedom rings,' so King can speak here.\\" King spoke to an overflow crowd on February 11, 1958, at Annie Merner Pfeiffer Chapel at Bennett. Willa Player encouraged Bennett College women to act their beliefs for civil rights and activism. Initially unaware that Bennett students were planning civil rights protests after King, Howard Thurman and Benjamin E. Mays had spoken at the college, Player encouraged them in their participation in sit-ins to achieve integration of lunch counters. She held meetings with faculty and staff during the Greensboro actions sit-ins to educate them, and arranged to support students in jail by delivering their assignments so they would not fall behind. Service In 1962, Player was named President of the National Association of Schools and Colleges of the Methodist Church. She was the first African American to serve on the board of trustees of Ohio Wesleyan. After 36 years of service to Bennett College, Willa Player stepped down as president in 1966. She was appointed that year by President Lyndon B. Johnson's administration as the first female Director of the Division of College Support in the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare, a position she held until retiring in 1986. Professional and civic membership Player served as a Mott Foundation Trustee from 1981 to 1995 and trustee emeritus from 1995 to 2003. She was a member of Kappa Delta Pi, Pi Lambda Theta, the South Atlantic Regional Philosophy Education Society, North Carolina and National Teachers associations, National Council of Negro Women; Women's Planning Committee, St. Matthews Methodist Church; and Japan International Christian University Foundation, Incorporated. Quotes \\"The black woman is expected to be a superwoman without acting like one\\" – Willa B. Player On the Bennett students' 1960 protest: \\"We don't teach our students what to think. We teach how to think. If I have to give exams in jail, that's what I'll do. – Willa B.

Middle East Afghan War In the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, psychological operations tactics were employed to demoralise the Taliban and to win the sympathies of the Afghan population. At least six EC-130E Commando Solo aircraft were used to jam local radio transmissions and transmit replacement propaganda messages. Leaflets were also dropped throughout Afghanistan, offering rewards for Osama bin Laden and other individuals, portraying Americans as friends of Afghanistan and emphasising various negative aspects of the Taliban. Another shows a picture of Mohammed Omar in a set of crosshairs with the words: \\"We are watching.\\" Iraq War Both the United States and Iraq employed propaganda during the Iraq War. The United States established campaigns towards the American people on the justifications of the war while using similar tactics to bring down Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq.Altheide, David L. \\"War and Mass Mediated Evidence.\\" Cultural Studies — Critical Methodologies 9 (2009): 14–22. =Iraqi propaganda= The Iraqi insurgency's plan was to gain as much support as possible by using violence as their propaganda tool.Garfield, Andrew. \\"The U.S. Counter-propaganda Failure in Iraq.\\" Middle East Quarterly 14 (2007): 23–32.

Others used flyers, leaflets, articles and self-published newspapers and magazines to get the point across. Insurgents also produced CDs and DVDs and distributed them in communities that the Iraq and the US Government were trying to influence.Garfield, Andrew. \\"The U.S. Counter-propaganda Failure in Iraq.\\" Middle East Quarterly 14 (2007): 26 The insurgents designed advertisements that cost a fraction of what the US was spending on their ads aimed at the same people in Iraq with much more success. In addition, a domestic Arabic language television station was established with the aim of informing the Iraqi public of alleged coalition propaganda efforts in the country. =US propaganda in Iraq= US PSYOP pamphlet disseminated in Iraq. The pamphlet says: \\"This is your future, Al-Zarqawi\\", and shows Al-Qaeda fighter Al-Zarqawi caught in a rat trap. To achieve their aim of a moderate, pro-western Iraq, US authorities were careful to avoid conflicts with Islamic culture that would produce passionate reactions from Iraqis, but differentiating between \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" Islam has proved challenging for the US. The US implemented black propaganda by creating false radio personalities that would disseminate pro- American information, but supposedly run by the supporters of Saddam Hussein. One radio station used was Radio Tikrit. Another example of use of black propaganda is that the United States paid Iraqis to publish articles written by US troops in their newspapers under the idea that they are unbiased and real accounts; this was brought forth by The New York Times in 2005.Shah, Anup. Iraq War Media Reporting, Journalism and Propaganda. Aug 1, 2007. May 12, 2009. The article stated that it was the Lincoln Group who had been hired by the US government to create the propaganda. However, their names were later cleared from any wrongdoing. The US was more successful with the Voice of America campaign, which is an old Cold War tactic that exploited people's desire for information. While the information they gave out to the Iraqis was truthful, they were in a high degree of competition with the opposing forces after the censorship of the Iraqi media was lifted with the removal of Saddam from power.Goldstein, Sol. \\"A Strategic Failure: American Information Control Policy in Occupied Iraq.\\" Military Review 88.2 (Mar. 2008): 58–65. In November 2005, the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times alleged that the United States military had manipulated news reported in Iraqi media in an effort to cast a favourable light on its actions while demoralising the insurgency. Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, a military spokesman in Iraq, said the program is \\"an important part of countering misinformation in the news by insurgents\\", while a spokesman for former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said the allegations of manipulation were troubling if true. The Department of Defense confirmed the existence of the program. =Propaganda aimed at US citizens= The extent to which the US government used propaganda aimed at its own people is a matter of discussion.

Every year, a state-owned publishing house releases several cartoons (called geurim-chaek in North Korea), many of which are smuggled across the Chinese border and, sometimes, end up in university libraries in the United States. The books are designed to instill the Juche philosophy of Kim Il-sung (the \\"father\\" of North Korea)—radical self-reliance of the state. The plots mostly feature scheming capitalists from the United States and Japan who create dilemmas for naïve North Korean characters. DPRK textbooks claim that US missionaries came to the Korean Peninsula and committed barbarous acts against Korean children, including injecting dangerous liquids into the children and writing the word \\"THIEF\\" on the forehead of any child who stole an apple for missionary-owned orchards in Korea.Nuclear Nightmare: Understanding North Korea Mexican drug cartels Drug cartels have been engaged in propaganda and psychological campaigns to influence their rivals and those within their area of influence. They use banners and narcomantas to threaten their rivals. Some cartels hand out pamphlets and leaflets to conduct public relation campaigns. They have been able to control the information environment by threatening journalists, bloggers and others who speak out against them. They have elaborate recruitment strategies targeting young adults to join their cartel groups. They have successfully branded the word narco, and the word has become part of Mexican culture. There is music, television shows, literature, beverages, food and architecture that all have been branded narco. United States of America The Shared Values Initiative was a public relations campaign that was intended to sell a \\"new\\" America to Muslims around the world by showing that American Muslims were living happily and freely, without persecution, in post-9/11 America. Funded by the United States Department of State, the campaign created a public relations front group known as Council of American Muslims for Understanding (CAMU). The campaign was divided in phases; the first of which consisted of five mini-documentaries for television, radio, and print with shared values messages for key Muslim countries. Mainland China Revolutionary opera with a scene from the Red Detachment of Women. Propaganda is used by the Communist Party of China to sway public and international opinion in favour of its policies. Domestically, this includes censorship of proscribed views and an active cultivation of views that favour the government. Propaganda is considered central to the operation of the Chinese government. The term in general use in China, xuanchuan (宣傳 \\"propaganda; publicity\\") can have either a neutral connotation in official government contexts or a pejorative connotation in informal contexts.Kingsley Edney (2014), The Globalization of Chinese Propaganda: International Power and Domestic Political Cohesion, Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 22, 195. Some xuanchuan collocations usually refer to \\"propaganda\\" (e.g., xuānchuánzhàn 宣传战 \\"propaganda war\\"), others to \\"publicity\\" (xuānchuán méijiè 宣傳媒介 \\"mass media; means of publicity\\"), and still others are ambiguous (xuānchuányuán 宣传员 \\"propagandist; publicist\\").Translations from John DeFrancis, ed. (2003), ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary, University of Hawaii Press, p. 1087. Aspects of propaganda can be traced back to the earliest periods of Chinese history, but propaganda has been most effective in the twentieth century owing to mass media and an authoritarian government. China in the era of Mao Zedong is known for its constant use of mass campaigns to legitimise the state and the policies of leaders. It was the first Chinese government to successfully make use of modern mass propaganda techniques, adapting them to the needs of a country which had a largely rural and illiterate population. In poor developing countries, China spreads propaganda through methods such as opening Confucius Institutes, and providing training programs in China for foreign officials and students. Vietnam Propaganda posters in Vietnam with images of solidarity and Ho Chi Minh Posters hanging everywhere often describe unity of the working class, farmers and soldiers under the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh. Residents and students have been studying ethics and ideology of Ho Chi Minh.

Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 21 March 2015 Life Little documentary evidence survives for the life of Pieter Stevens.Pieter Stevens at Christie’s He was likely born in Mechelen somewhere between 1557 and 1577. There is no information as to whether he was related to Pieter Stevens I, a draughtsman active between 1550 and 1570. A Capriccio View of a City (possibly Prague) A group of Roman views dated to 1590–91 has been interpreted as an indication that he visited Italy as a young man. However, these drawings are rather crude and probably based on works of Jan Brueghel the Elder and are therefore no evidence that he visited Italy in those years. However, he may have done somewhat later as the first mature works known by him dated 1592 represent views of Roman sights. By April 1594 Stevens is recorded in Prague at his appointment as a court painter to the Emperor Rudolf II, with a salary of 8 guilders per month. It is likely that he became acquainted with the many other Flemish and Dutch artists active at the Prague court such as Roelandt Savery, Paulus van Vianen, Hans Vredeman de Vries, his son Paul Vredeman de Vries and Philippus van den Bossche. After Rudolf's death in 1612, Stevens likely entered the service of Karl I, Prince of Liechtenstein. Details about the time and place of his death are not available. He must have died between 1626 and 1632 as in 1626 he was last recorded in connection with the funeral of his son Šroněk and in 1632 his daughter sold his house, for which she required a proxy of her brother, a sign that the artist was then deceased. Mountain Valley with Inn and Castle He was the father of Anton II (who trained under him) and Peter III.More about Prague painters Anton Stevens see Štěpán Vácha and Radka Heisslerová, Ve stínu Karla Škréty. Pražští malíři v letech 1635–1680. Antonín Stevens, Jan Bedřich Hess, Matěj Zimprecht [= In the Shadow of Karel Škréta. Prague Painters in 1635–1680. Anton Stevens, Johann Friedrich Hess, Matthias Zimprecht]. Prague: Academia, 2017. He was an uncle of Maurus Moreels (II) of Mechelen who studied under him in Prague and had a successful career as a history and portrait painter upon his return to Flanders.Maurus Moreels (II) at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Two of his grandsons were also painters in Prague. Work Pieter Stevens II was principally a painter and draughtsman of landscapes. The earliest known work of Stevens is the Mountain valley with inn and castle, dated 1593 (Museumslandschaft Hessen Kassel). The composition is executed in a very refined finish and was possibly the work he made to support his application for a position at the Imperial court. Innovative through its complete omission of a view into the distance this painting heralds the idyllic close-up landscape of the 17th century. His contemporaries would probably have been more aware of the uncanniness of the sealed off, swampy valley with its ruinous castle, decaying inn and invalid wayfarers. They would likely have understood these details as symbols of the wickedness of the world, the arrogance of the powerful and the licentiousness of the lowly who can expect punishment.Pieter Stevens II, Mountain valley with inn and castle at the Museumslandschaft of Hesse in Kassel Feast on the anniversary of a church consecration His early landscapes show genre elements as can be seen in the Feast on the anniversary of a church consecration (Fondation Custodia, Paris) dated 1594 and the Kermesse in the countryside dated 1596 (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp). The Feast on the anniversary of a church consecration shows a crowded fair near an inn held to mark the anniversary of the consecration of a church. The scene is set in Rome even though such celebrations were actually a northern tradition. The church in the background on the right has been identified as Santa Maria in Cosmedin on the Forum Boarium. As Stevens possibly never went to Rome he must have relied on other artists' work for the Roman details.Pieter Stevens, Feast on the anniversary of a church consecration at Fondation Custodia These early compositions are clearly linked to the style of contemporary works produced by Flemish landscape artists such as Hendrick van Cleve III, Hans Bol, Lucas van Valckenborch, Paul Bril and the members of the Frankenthal School. The Temptation of Christ Many of Stevens' works depict nocturnal landscapes of a romantic character.Margarita Russell, 'Visions of the Sea: Hendrick C. Vroom and the Origins of Dutch Marine Painting', Brill Archive, 1983, pp. 21–23 These works show his interest in light and atmospheric effects. A good example is the Fishing at Night of c. 1600 (Kunsthistorisches Museum). This is even more pronounced in his drawings where there is a clear move away from his early drawings with pen and dark brown or black ink with deep blue washes in favour of the brush and a combination of soft tones. It is possible that Jan Brueghel the Elder's visit to Prague in 1604 played a role in the change as Brueghel favoured a similar wash technique. The influence of Jan Brueghel is further apparent in the greater sense of volume and better integration of the figures. He drew around 1604 a numbered series of views around Brussels, Rome, Naples and Prague, which he probably intended to be engraved. Landscape designs by Stevens and Jan Brueghel and others were reproduced in hardstone in the imperial workshop and used as 'Florentine mosaics' to decorate luxurious furniture. He thanked his renown in his time to the reproduction of his designs by various engravers, including Aegidius Sadeler, Hendrick Hondius I, Isaac Major and Joannes Barra. Sadeler's series of romantic Bohemian forest landscapes engraved in Prague after designs by Stevens and other artists formed an important element in the development of 17th-century Dutch and Flemish landscape painting. Sadeler also published the Four Seasons and The Twelve Months after Pieter Stevens' designs.Christine van Mulders. \\"Sadeler.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press.

Gold nanoparticle technology shows promise in the advancement of cancer treatments. Some of the properties that gold nanoparticles possess, such as small size, non-toxicity and non-immunogenicity make these molecules useful candidates for targeted drug delivery systems. With tumor-targeting delivery vectors becoming smaller, the ability to by-pass the natural barriers and obstacles of the body becomes more probable. To increase specificity and likelihood of drug delivery, tumor specific ligands may be grafted onto the particles along with the chemotherapeutic drug molecules, to allow these molecules to circulate throughout the tumor without being redistributed into the body. Physical properties 273x273px Size Gold nanoparticles range in size depending on which therapy they are being used for. In photothermal cancer therapy, many gold nanoparticle molecules are used in each test and they must all be uniform in size. Including PEG coating, the nanoparticles measured to be ~130 nm in diameter. Gold nanoparticles that act as drug delivery systems in conjugation with chemotherapeutic drugs typically range in size from 10 to 100 nm. Surface area plays a very important role in drug delivery and per mg of gold, as diameters decrease, the surface areas needed to transport drugs increase to the point where a single 1mL volume of 1.8 nm spherical gold nanoparticles have the same surface area as a cell phone.Gold Nanoparticle Properties and Applications Drug vectorization requires greater specificity, and are synthesized within the single digit measurements ranging from 3-7 nm. Antibacterial treatments are testing different sizes for cell type targeting; 10, 20 and 40 nm. Color Due to the ability to tune the size and absorption of AuNPs, these molecules can vary in the colors they emit. Colors of AuNP solutions typically range from vibrant red to pale blue. These colors play a necessary role in the synthesis of AuNPs as indicators of reduction. The color of AuNPs can be modified by the application of pressure which reddish the nanoparticles.  Synthesis  For more on synthesis of AuNPs for medical use, see Colloidal gold Other synthesis may include cell type targeting. A tumor consists of a multitude of cell types, and thus targeting a single type of cell is ineffective and potentially dangerous. At most, this type of targeting would only have a minor effect on killing the tumor. Tumors are constantly changing and thus phenotype targeting is rendered useless. Two main problems persist: how to get to the target and how to destroy a variety of cells. Treatments Photothermal cancer therapy A direct method of accessing and destroying tumour cells can be accomplished by photothermal cancer therapy or photodynamic therapy (PDT). This procedure is known to treat small tumours that are difficult to access and avoids the drawbacks (adverse effects) of conventional methods, including the unnecessary destruction of healthy tissues. The cells are destroyed by exposure to light, rupturing membranes causing the release of digestive enzymes. AuNPs have high absorption cross sections requiring only minimal input of irradiation energy. Human breast carcinoma cells infused with metal nanoparticles in vitro have been shown to have an increase in morbidity with exposure to near infrared (NIR). Short term exposure in vivo (4–6 minutes) to NIR had undergone the same effect. Hirsch et al observed that extreme heating in tumours would cause irreversible tissue damage including coagulation, cell shrinkage and loss of nuclear straining. Results of their in vivo nanoshell therapy of mice revealed penetration of the tumor ~5mm.The metal particles were tuned to high absorption and scattering, resulting in effective conversion of light into heat covering a large surface area. The El-Sayed group studied AuNP effects in vitro and in vivo. They determined that the NIR wavelengths were converted into heat on the picosecond timescale, allowing for short exposure of CW to minimize possible exposure to healthy cells. In vitro, photothermal therapy was used in oral epithelial cell lines, (HSC 313 and HOC 3 Clone 8) and one benign epithelial cell line (HaCaT). El-Sayed et al found that the malignant cells that had undergone incubation in AuNPs conjugated with anti-epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) required half the energy to destroy a cell than a benign cell. Their material included gold coated silica nanoshells that could selectively absorb NIR waves. The particles were tuned by varying the thickness of the Au shell and changing the size of the silica core. In exposing these particles to NIR, the efficacy of Au was measured through the decrease of EFGR in oral squamous carcinoma cells. There are various biotechnological advances for in vivo delivery of drugs. To effectively target the malignant cells, the AuNPs were conjugated by polyethylene glycol, a process known as PEGylation. This masks the foreign particles from the immune system such that it arrives at its destination and increases circulation time in the system. Antibody conjugation lines the surface of the nanoparticle with cell markers to limit spread only to malignant cells. In vivo testing of mice that developed murine colon carcinoma tumour cells. They were injected with the solution of AuNPs that were allowed to spread after 6 hours. Surrounding cells were swabbed with PEG and exposed to laser treatment for detection of abnormal heating indicating areas where Au nanoshells may have gathered. The injected area was also swabbed with PEG to maximize light penetration. Despite the unquestionable success of gold nanorods or nanoshells as photothermal agents in preclinical research, they have yet to obtain the approval for clinical use because their size is above the renal excretion threshold. In 2019, the first NIR-absorbing plasmonic ultrasmall-in-nano architecture has been reported, and jointly combine: (i) an efficient photothermal conversion suitable for multiple hyperthermia treatments, and (ii) renal excretion of the building blocks after the therapeutic action. Radiofrequency therapy X-ray radiography procedures involves the diagnosis of cancer cells through the process of image acquisition. These techniques rely on the absorption of x-rays on the exposed tissue in order to improve image quality. In certain radiological procedures such as Radiofrequency therapy, a contrast agent is injected into the targeted cancer tissue and result in increased x-ray attenuation. Radiofrequency therapy treatment involves the destruction of tumor cancer tissue cells through the differential heating of cancer tissue by radio-frequency diathermy. This differential heating is a result of the blood supply in the body carrying away the heat and cooling the heated tissue. Gold nanoparticles are excellent absorbers of x-rays, due to its high atomic number of 197Au. This allows for a higher mass of the element, providing for a greater area of x-ray absorption. By acting as a contrast agent and injected into cancerous tumor cells, it would result in a higher dose of the cancerous tissue being exposed during radiotherapy treatment. Additionally gold nanoparticles are more efficiently removed from cells of healthy tissue, in comparison with cancer cells - a feature that makes them a promising radiosensitizers Angiogenesis therapy Angiogenesis is a process involving the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels. It involves the degradation of the extracellular matrix, activation, migration, proliferation, and differentiation of endothelial cells into vessels. It is said to play a large part in the growth and spread of cancer cells. The process of angiogenesis involves the use of both promoters and inhibitors, balancing the process by only forming new blood vessels when needed. Examples of promoters include Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) Examples of inhibitors include Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 1, etc. Tumor progression occurs as a result of the transition from a tumor in the dormant proliferation stage to the active stage as a result of oxygen and nutrients. This active stage leads to a state of cellular hypoxia, which causes an increased regulation of pro-angiogenesis proteins such as VEGF. This results in the spreading of inflammatory proteins and cancer cells alongside the newly created blood vessels. AuNPs have the ability to inhibit angiogenesis by directly coordinating to heparin binding growth factors. They inhibit phosphorylation of proteins responsible for angiogenesis in a dose dependent matter. At concentrations 335-670 nM, almost complete inhibition of phosphorylation was observed. As a consequence of angiogenesis, rheumatoid arthritis has been found to develop due to the greater ability to spread inflammatory proteins. Through the inhibition of angiogenesis, the reduction of rheumatoid arthritis is prevalent. In addition, angiogenic inhibitors have a critical limitation due to the instability of biological conditions and high dosage required. To counter this, an emerging strategy for the development of therapies targeting tumor-associated angiogenesis through the use of nanotechnology and anti-angiogenic agents was developed, known as anti-angiogenic therapy. This approach solved the limitation instability by speeding up the delivery of angiogenesis inhibitors. Gold nanoparticles display anti-angiogenic properties by inhibiting the function of pro- angiogenic heparin-binding growth factors (HG – GFs), with prime examples being the vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF165) and the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) - both of which are pro-angiogenic promoters. Studies by Rochelle R. Arvizo, et al. have shown that the use of AuNPs of various size and surface charge plays an important role in its inhibitory effects. In today’s biological fields, the use of nanotechnology has allowed for the indirect use of AuNPs to deliver DNA to mammalian cells; thereby reducing tumor agents and increasing efficiency of electron transfer by modulating the activity of glucose oxidase. Current ongoing research by the Mayo Clinic laboratories includes the examination of AuNPs as messengers to deliver reagents capable of manipulating the angiogenic response in vivo. Current angiogenic inhibitors used today which are approved by the USFDA to treat cancer is Ayastin, Nexavar, Sutent and Affinitor. Anti-bacterial therapy Gold nanoparticles are used as bacteria targeting particles in antibacterial therapy. The therapy targets bacteria with light absorbing gold nanoparticles (10 nm, 20 nm, 40 nm) conjugated with specific antibodies, thus selectively kill bacteria using laser. Studies has shown the effectiveness of this method on killing Staphylococcus aureus, which is significant human pathogen responsible for a wide range of diseases such as skin and wound infections, toxic shock syndrome, septic arthritis, endocarditis, and osteomyelitis. In this system, the bacteria damage is caused by inducing strong laser which leads to overheating effects accompanied by the bubble- formation phenomena around clustered gold nanoparticles. The selective targeting of S. aureus was performed using a monoclonal antibody to one of the major surface-clustered proteins, protein A (spa), which is linked to the peptidoglycan portion of the cell wall. Monoclonal antibodies ensure the targeting of the specific cell, which is essential to this mechanism. Killing efficiency depends on local overheating effects accompanied by the bubble- formation phenomena, the bubble formation would enhance the PT killing effect.Better heating efficiency results from an enhanced ability to confine the nanosecond laser-pulse within the nanocluster’s size. Overlapping of bubbles from different nanoparticles within the nanoclusters decreases the bubble-formation threshold. An increase in the cluster’s average local absorption and its potential redshifting (from 525 nm for a single gold spherical nanoparticle to 700–800 nm for nanoclusters) in response to plasmon- plasmon resonance. Drug vectorization Another way in which AuNPs can be used in cancer therapy is as agents for targeted drug delivery. Research shows that AuNPs can be easily functionalized and conjugated with a variety of molecules, including chemotherapeutic drugs such as Doxorubicin. One major complication with the current methods of treating cancer with chemotherapy is that treatment is not optimized to specifically target cancer cells and the widespread distribution of chemotherapeutic drugs throughout the body can cause harmful side effects such as naseua, hair loss, and cardiotoxicity. Since many of the characteristics of AuNPs allow them to target cancer cells specifically and accumulate within tumor cells, these molecules can act as tumor-targeting drug delivery systems. Once within the tumor microenvironment, these complexes dissociate and release the chemotherapeutic, allowing the drug to take effect and eventually cause apoptosis. Gold nanoparticles have their advantages in drug vectorization. They can pack several different sizes and types of dendrimers and several different types of ligands in order to effectively treat different types of cancers. For example, research shows that 80~90% of breast cancer’s tumor cells have estrogen receptors and 60~70% of prostate cancer’s tumor cells have androgen receptors. These significant amount of hormone receptors play a role in intermolecular actions. This role is now used by targeting and therapeutic ligands on gold nanoparticles to target tissue-selective anti-tumor drug delivery. In order to have multiple targeting and therapeutic ligands bind with gold nanoparticles, the gold nanoparticles must first undergo polymer stabilization. Then, anti-estrogen molecules with thiolated PEG are bound to gold nanoparticles via Au-S bonds, forming thiolate protected gold nanoparticles.E. Dreaden, L. Austin, M. Mackey, M. El-Sayed,. \\"Ther Deliv:size matters: gold nanoparticles in targeted cancer drug delivery, 3(4): 457-478; 2012 414x414px Docetaxel is packed into PEGylated gold nanoparticlesA. Francois, A.

Market approval A Pilot Study of AuroLase™ Therapy (gold nano shells) in refractory and/or recurrent tumors of the head and neck was completed in 2009 and two trials are currently using AuroLase™ therapy for the treatment of primary/metastatic lung cancer and for prostate cancer. Other gold nanoparticles on the market are mostly for synthesis of nanoparticle complexes in research. Nanocomposix specializes in the production of various sizes of nanoparticles, controlled by varying the concentrations of reducing reagent and HAuCl4. Sigma Aldrich offers six different sizes of spherical gold nanoparticles and have developed gold nanourchins for similar usage. The surface causes a red shift in the surface plasmon peak as compared to spherical gold nanoaprticles. Nanopartz offers gold nanoparticles and gold nanorods for preclinical in vivo therapeutics that have been used extensively in preclinical therapeutics including photothermal hyperthermia and chemotherapeutic drug delivery. The pilot study using the Ntracker gold nanorods was completed in 2012 and was used on seven canines with varying degrees of solid cancer tumors. The results showed significant loading of the gold nanorods after intravenous injection into the cancer tumors and significant heating of the tumors from an external laser. Images are found at Adverse effects and limitations Shape Depending on the shape of the molecule, the absorbance will vary, i.e. spherical particles will absorb wavelengths in the NIR region with a relatively low absorbance compared to long rods. Chan et al observed that 50 nm spherical nanoparticles were taken up more efficiently than both larger and smaller particles of the same shape. In regards to size, the spheres were taken up more efficiently than the rods. Ability of greater uptake of nanoshells into the cell will localize in the perinuclear membrane and accumulate to deliver toxic effects. Charge Electrostatic interactions were also investigated by Rotello et al by conjugating AuNPs with anionic and cationic functional groups. Their results showed that toxicity was more established in AuNPs conjugated with cationic functional groups as a consequence of electrostatic interactions with the anionic cell membrane. Concentration The concentrations of gold nanoparticles in biological systems for practical usage range from 1-100 nanoparticles per cell. High concentrations may lead to adverse effects for cell structure and function, which may not appear non-toxic in assays but preparation of the particles have been found to produce abnormal effects in the cell. If large concentrations quickly clear the blood vessels, the nanoshells may accumulate in major organs (mainly the liver and spleen). Residual concentrations of these particles were also found in kidneys, lungs, muscle, brain, and bone of mice after 28 days. The concentration of the solution injected intravenously 2.4*1011 nanoshells/mL. Even without complete clearance from the system, the nanoshells did not cause any physiological complications in the mice. Su et al observed a correlation with the concentration of Au3Cu and cell damage. Cells were incubated in concentrations of 0.001 and 200 mg mL−1 Au3Cu. They concluded a 15% cell viability and dose dependent cell damage. Reduction in cell viability was detected in vivo experiments; also related to dosage. Cytotoxicity is not a major concern in the usage of AuNPs, as they localize in the vesicles and cytoplasm as opposed to the nucleus. Thus, no complications spawned due to their aggregation in these parts of the cell.  Heating  Two key factors to consider when irradiating gold nanoparticles in cancer cells are the lattice cooling rate and lattice heat content. The lattice cooling rate is how fast heat in the particle is distributed to its surroundings. If the cooling rate for a particle is too low, the lattice heat content can be increased with moderate energy radiation (40 µJ/fs with 100-fs laser at 800 nm) to the point where gold nanorods can be melted to create spherical nanoparticles which become photothermally inactive. This decomposition has been shown using gold nanorods coated with phosphatidylcholine ligands in HeLa cells using a pulsed laser and were no longer useful for treatment due to their low NIR radiation absorbance. High energy laser pulses have also been shown to fragment nanorods into smaller particles. While these structural changes induced by laser pulses could be used to deactivate the photothermal effects of these particles after treatment, the resulting spherical particles or other particle fragments could lead to complications during or after treatment when gold nanoparticles are used for clinical treatment and imaging of cancer cells. A limitation of photothermal chemotherapy using gold nanoparticles involves the choice of laser when conducting treatment. Pulsed lasers offer very selective treatment of cancer cells within a small, localized area, but can lead to potential destruction of particles and have a low heating efficiency due to heat lost during the single pulse excitation. Continuous wave lasers have a higher heating efficiency and work better in heating larger areas with lower risk of destroying the nanoparticles being heated. However, treatment with continuous wave lasers are much longer compared to treatment with a pulsed laser. A limitation of photothermal therapy with respect to the laser used is the depth of the tumor being treated. Most lasers used to induce tumor ablation using gold nanoparticles can only reach several centimeters into soft tissue, making it impossible to reach tumors farther in the body. Finding a way to carry out therapy in cells farther into the body without damaging surrounding cells is essential to making this technique viable as a cancer treatment in the future.  Toxicity  =Toxic precursors= Studies in human leukemia cells revealed that prolonged exposure in AuNPs did not harm the cells, even at ~100 μM of Au. Rather they reduced the amount of reactive oxygen species in the cell. However, precursors to AuNP synthesis (CTAB and HAuCl4) were found to be toxic at small concentrations (10 μM); free CTAB especially. Studies in HeLa cells by Niidome et al further support this statement by examining the correlation with the removal of excess CTAB and cell viability rose to 90%. = Toxicity of nanoparticles in vivo and in vitro = After using nanoparticles for photothermal therapy, it has been shown in vitro that high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed within the treated cancer cells. While these species are not of concern to the dead cancer cells, they can cause oxidative stress in surrounding healthy cells if enough ROS are created leading to healthy cell death. This oxidative stress can be passivated using polymers as reducing agents (after degradation of the nanoparticle) and damage from ROS can be reduced using targeted uptake of the nanoparticles to the cancer cells. The mechanism for the oxidative stress caused by nanoparticles in the body is still the subject of study and provides a possible limitation when using gold nanoparticles with radiation within the body. While there are many in vitro studies of gold nanoparticles used for chemotherapy, in vivo studies are both rare and often report conflicting results. For example, one in vivo study has shown that 13-nm gold nanoparticles circulated in the bloodstream often “accumulate in the liver and spleen and…have long blood circulation times.\\" Also, nanoparticles from 8 to 37 nanometers have been shown to cause abnormal symptoms leading to death in mice due to medical complications in the spleen, liver, and lungs. Yet, other studies have shown that 20 nm gold nanoparticles can pass into the retina without causing any cytotoxic effects and nanoparticles of 13 nm diameter were not toxic in the body. Many argue that these results differ due to different concentrations on nanoparticles used for these experiments and requires further research. Biosafety and biokinetics investigations on biodegradable ultrasmall-in-nano architectures have demonstrated that gold nanoparticles are able to avoid metal accumulation in organisms through escaping by the renal pathway. Part of the issue with these studies is the lack of reliable methods for determining the uptake of gold nanoparticles in vivo without examining the tumor site post-mortem. Gold nanoparticle uptake in cells is often carried out by examining the organs of injected mice post-mortem. This technique cannot be replicated during clinical trials, so new methods need to be developed to determine the uptake of cells to avoid higher concentrations of gold nanoparticles in the body leading to toxic effects. One recently suggested method to counter this limitation is radiolabeling. The uptake of thiolated gold nanoparticles has recently been monitored using 111In-labeled polymer shells that surround the gold nanoparticle and shows a possible way around this problem, but these polymer shells can be removed from the particle making a more stable labeling system required for these kinds of studies. Other uses The ligand used to decrease aggregation of gold nanorods. Gold nanoparticles may be used in an indirectly therapeutic way. The issue of angiogenesis describes the formation of new blood vessels, which not only increased spread of cancerous cells, but may proliferate the spread of proteins responsible for rheumatoid arthritis. As AuNPs reduce angiogenesis, rheumatoid arthritis is reduced as a result. Chamberland et al studied the use of anti-TNF conjugated gold nanorods (AuNRs) ex vivo in rat tail joints to reduce the effect of rheumatoid arthritis. They observed the effects of the drug delivery system via PAT technology. The properties of the AuNRs found to be the most efficient had measurements of 45 x 15 nm with an absorption peak of 660 nm. This tuning allowed for better contrast between the targeted areas and intra-articular tissue. Thus, the etanercept conjugated AuNRs were seen to increase the light sensitivity. The imaging technique provides greater opportunities for sensitive in vivo drug tracking in biothechnology. HIV Several valences of AuNPs were found to inhibit HIV fusion. 2-nm AuNP- mercaptobenzoic acid were conjugated to a derivative of a known CCR5 antagonist, which is a small molecule that antagonize CCR5 receptor, and CCR5 is commonly used by HIV to enter the cell. The CCR5 antagonist would bind to CCR5, leaving no spots for HIV to bind. This will ultimately lead to an effect that restrict HIV infection. Hepatitis B Prepared AuNPs-Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA gene probes could be used to detect HBV DNA directly. The detection- visualized fluorescence-based method is highly sensitive, simple, low cost, which could potentially apply to multi-gene detection chips. The probe used here is essentially a biosensor, to specifically detect a certain material. Tuberculosis A successful application of the AuNP-nanoprobe colorimetric method to clinical diagnosis reported by Baptista et al. was the sensitive detection in clinical samples of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the cause of human tuberculosis.

The film focuses on a state senator who disappears from a train and detective Violet Gray investigates the case. Gray manages to find that he was kidnapped and that it was done because he opposed a powerful lobby. She manages to free the state senator in time for him to cast the deciding vote to defeat the lobby. The film was released on January 13, 1911, it was the second of four films in the \\"Violet Gray, Detective\\" series. The film received favorable reviews from Billboard and The New York Dramatic Mirror. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  The Moving Picture World synopsis states, \\"State Senator Jack Dare, one of the reform members of the legislature, starts to the state capitol to attend an important session of that body. That he took the midnight train from his home city is clearly proven, for his aged mother was a passenger on it, and besides the conductor and porter are certain that he retired for the night. In the morning, however, his berth is empty, although some of his garments are found there. The case puzzles the railroad officials and the police, and Violet Gray is given a chance to distinguish herself. She learns from the conductor and porter, who had happened to spend the night awake at opposite ends of the car, that the senator did not go by them. Consequently this leaves only the window as his means of egress, and she knows that he must have gone that way. Violet discovers that Dare is a hearty supporter of a bill that a powerful lobby is trying to defeat. The fight is so close that his is the deciding vote. Dare cannot be bribed, so his opponents spirited him away in a novel fashion. But the girl finds where he is hidden and brings him back, although he is much injured. He reaches his seat in time to cast the needed vote, and to astound and defeat the lobby.\\"  Cast and production  The only known credit in the cast is Julia M. Taylor as Violet Gray. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not cite any scenario or directorial credits. At this time the Thanhouser company operated out of their studio in New Rochelle, New York. In October 1910, an article in The Moving Picture World described the improvements to the studio as having permanently installed a lighting arrangement that was previously experimental in nature. The studio had amassed a collection of props for the productions and dressing rooms had been constructed for the actors. The studio had installed new equipment in the laboratories to improve the quality of the films. By 1911, the Thanhouser company was recognized as one of leading Independent film makers, but Carl Laemmle's Independent Moving Picture Company (IMP) captured most of the publicity. Two production companies were maintained by the company, the first under Barry O'Neil and the second under Lucius J. Henderson and John Noble, an assistant director to Henderson. Though the company had at least two Bianchi cameras from Columbia Phonograph Company, it is believed that imported cameras were also used. The Bianchi cameras were unreliable and inferior to competitors, but it was believed to be a non-infringing camera, though with \\"rare fortune\\" it could shoot up to 200 feet of film before requiring repairs. Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on January 13, 1911. This would be billed as the second in the series following the successful Love And Law film. The two later releases would be The Norwood Necklace and The Court's Decree would conclude the \\"Violet Gray, Detective\\" series. Apparently the film series made an impact because the Lubin Manufacturing Company released a film under the title Violet Dare, Detective in June 1913. The film received a positive review from The Billboard for its interest plot, good acting and photography. The New York Dramatic Mirror found the film to be a good melodrama, but found fault in that a woman detective was used to resolve the case when the part would have had more dignity and realism if the case was resolved by a man. The film would be shown in Pennsylvania and be advertised by theaters even a year after its release.

Opioid crisis Georgetown University Medical Center professor, Fugh-Berman, served as a paid expert witness in the lawsuit filed in 2017 by the State of Oklahoma against 13 major pharmaceutical companies for \\"damages linked to the opioid crisis. According to the original 2017 petition, Oklahoma said the sale of Oxycontin, by its manufacturer, Purdue Pharma, from 1996 to 2009, rose from $48 million to $3 billion. According to a March 26, 2019 PBS News article, Fugh-Berman who works out of the University's Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, said that over time, \\"industry-generated narrative [became] conventional wisdom\\". PBS News wrote that \\"these deadly consequences didn’t happen overnight\\". Fugh-Berman said that the industry used \\"pervasive marketing tactics\\" to \\"influence conversations\\" between \\"patients\\", \\"doctors, medical school students and instructors\\". The article said that \\"One tactic that opioid manufacturers used to protect sales was the rebranding of substance use disorder as pseudo addiction — that patients who took opioid medication and later developed symptoms of addiction should be treated with more opioids. According to the PBS News March 2019 article, even though \\"while fewer doctors are writing opioid prescriptions\\" than they did prior to the mid-2010s, Fugh-Berman said that \\"it is nowhere near a reasonable level.\\" PBS said that even in 2019, \\"opioid marketing continues to lead doctors to guide patients toward the drugs.\\" Views Fugh-Berman has been critical of multiple popular pharmaceutical drugs and treatments, including testosterone replacement therapy and flibanserin. She has also criticized how the numerical values used to diagnose diabetes and high cholesterol have been lowered over time, and has criticized Eli Lilly for allegedly inventing premenstrual dysphoric disorder to sell its drug Sarafem.

On 4 September 2020, the US Army deployed the 2nd Battalion of the 69th Armor Regiment, part of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Division, for training in Pabradė. They deployed with M1 Abrams, Bradley Fighting Vehicle, other vehicles and material. Reactions PM Bohuslav Sobotka (center) speaks with a member of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment during his visit to the convoy in Prague on 31 March 2015. 82% of Czechs approved and supported the US Army-NATO convoy that partook in Operation Dragoon Ride, according to an opinion poll that was conducted by the independent STEM agency in 2015. A NATO deployment in the early January 2017 was welcomed by Polish officials who described it as a necessary response to Russian military exercises near its border and its military intervention in Ukraine and members of the public as the materiel crossed into south-western Poland from Germany. The same deployment sparked protests in Germany and prompted a critical reaction among the country’s centre-left political parties, but was defended by the country’s ruling Christian Democrat Party (CDU) coalition and German military officials. An article about the deployment that was published by the Donbas News International (DNI) agency and its subsequent circulation in the Western conspiracy-theory cybersphere and Russian mediasphere was cited as an example of the creation and spread of fake news. An editorial by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette cautioned anyone against using the deployment as a domestic political tool.

Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations. London. pp. 224-225. The IMS was the result of a split in the Communist Party of Ireland. The Communist Party had always been reluctant to criticize the Soviet Union and consistently followed the Kremlin line. However, a number of party members were critical of the lack of democracy and civil liberties within the Soviet state. Following the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the party broke from the norm and denounced the invasion. Some of the more hard line pro-Soviet members, such as Michael O'Riordan, were unhappy with this and sought to have the decision reversed in the early 1970s. By 1975 it looked likely that the stance on the invasion, which by now had a large symbolic significance, would indeed be reversed. For many of the more Soviet-critical members, this was the last straw. Twenty-two party members resigned, forming the Irish Marxist Society shortly thereafter. Among the people involved were Sam Nolan, Mick O'Reilly, Joe Deasy and Paddy Carmody.Swan (2008), p. 90.DR O'Connor Lysaght (1976).

He was also an amateur violinist and sportsman.  Biography  He was the last child born to a family of modest means, when his parents were already in their forties. His father was a member of the gendarmerie and the family moved frequently.Brief biography @ the North Bohemian Gallery of Fine Arts in Litoměřice. From 1904 to 1905, he received his first art lessons from a teacher at the Gymnasium in Čáslav, who had noticed his talent. The Village Green in Ronov nad Doubravou (1911) After graduating, to please his parents, he decided on a career in philology and enrolled at the Faculty of Arts, Charles University in Prague. His interest in art persisted, however, and he took private lessons from Ludvík Vacátko. In 1908, he presented three paintings to the Mánes Union of Fine Arts and was admitted as an associate member. That same year, his parents retired to a rural home near the village of Běstvina, due to his mother's declining health. Although he told his family that he would complete his philology degree, he neglected to do so and devoted himself to art. He then became a one-year volunteer, to avoid serving a full term of conscription, passed the officer's exam, and returned to his family in 1910 to spend all of his time painting. Formal studies He steadfastly refused to exhibit, but still became a full member of the Mánes Union in 1911. Deciding that it was time for some formal training, he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich and studied with Ludwig von Herterich. He left the Academy in 1912, complaining that his Professor was too enamored of the Old Masters. His father viewed this as a failure and, once again, urged him to do something else. A Dry Day (1913) Instead, he applied for admission to the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague, but the requirements were too strict. He ended by attending the Technical University and taking drawing classes from Adolf Liebscher, which were designed to train high-school art teachers. This left him dissatisfied, as before, and he concluded that his style of painting was not compatible with earning money. He was worried about his parents and his eldest sister Vojslava, who was deaf, and he had received a letter from a close female friend saying that their relationship was over, so he became despondent and considered suicide. In late 1913, however, he simply went home to continue painting. After that, he finally began to exhibit locally, enjoying some success at a personal showing in Chotěboř. In June 1914, his reserve unit was mobilized. After a few weeks in Močovice, he was sent to Galicia. He was killed in battle shortly after, but he was buried in a mass grave and his family was not notified for several months. Despite having such a short life, he managed to produce at least 200 oil paintings and over 600 pastels. In 1944, the Nobel Prize winning Czech poet, Jaroslav Seifert wrote a long poem called Pruchovo jaro (Prucha's Spring).

She was born to a wealthy family and raised with a strong sense of noblesse oblige. She made substantial financial donations to numerous organizations, raised funds from her association with Chicago's elite families, and while not trained as a social worker, she served in the field as a competent and respected policy maker and administrator. She worked with the settlement movement at Hull House, court reform for youth via the Juvenile Protective Association, and numerous women's clubs and women's suffrage organizations. At the end of her 94 years, she had provided care to the impoverished and disenfranchised through her extensive public service and activism, especially attending to \\"the welfare and betterment of women, children, and their families.\\"  Early life and education  Born in 1859 in Chicago, Illinois, Louise DeKoven Bowen's parents were Helen Hadduck and John deKoven, a banker. In 1875, she graduated from Dearborn Seminary. The granddaughter of Fort Dearborn pioneers, DeKoven was an only child with a large inheritance; she was raised with the expectation that she should give back to her community. Her community service as an adult began at St. James Episcopal Church, where she taught Sunday School and established a boys' club. Though she became frustrated with the limitations for women within the church, she remained a lifelong member.  Career  Bowen's civic involvement extended to secular organizations throughout the city of Chicago, and to leadership positions at both state and national levels.  Hull House  In 1894 Bowen first became involved in Hull House after being asked by Jane Addams to lead the settlement house's Women's Club. She soon became a Hull House trustee and treasurer, holding the latter position for 53 years. She was a major donor and the primary fundraiser for the organization. She built a Boys' Club building, and in 1912, she endowed a summer camp for Hull House's poor children, the Bowen Country Club in Waukegan, Illinois (now known as Bowen Park). Bowen continued her association with Hull House for the remainder of her professional life; after Jane Addams died in 1935, Bowen was Hull House board president for nine years.  Juvenile court system  With Julia Lathrop, other reformers, and the Chicago Bar Association, Bowen “successfully lobbied for a new juvenile court in Chicago.” This first juvenile court in the United States opened in Chicago in 1899. The Juvenile Court Committee of Chicago helped monitor the new court system, and was part of what was known as the \\"child-saving movement.\\" Soon, \\"Bowen succeeded Lathrop as the group’s top officer, and during Bowen’s seven-year tenure the Court Committee procured the salaries of probation officers, administered the civil service exam used to select probation officers, investigated complaints of neglect, sat in juvenile court to advise judges, and established a juvenile detention home.\\" When the Juvenile Court Committee was reorganized in 1907 into the Juvenile Protective Association, Bowen became its first president. Through this position, which she held for 35 years, Bowen authored numerous studies, including a 1913 report called “The Colored People of Chicago,” in which she detailed \\"racial prejudice and discrimination in education, employment, housing, law enforcement, and entertainment.”  Woman's suffrage and women's causes  Bowen was a leader in the women's suffrage movement in Illinois, serving as president of the Chicago Equal Suffrage Association, vice president of the Illinois Suffrage Association, and auditor of the National Woman’s Suffrage Association. The latter role included touring and speaking throughout the country. After Theodore Roosevelt endorsed women's suffrage in his 1912 independent bid for president, Bowen campaigned for him. In 1916, she organized a march of 5,000 women through pouring rain to the Republican National Convention, arriving dramatically just after a speaker had said that women did not want the vote.Bowen, Growing Up With a City, 161 Along with other upper-class women in leadership positions in the Illinois suffrage movement, Bowen's role as leader and spokesperson helped give the movement legitimacy and was an important factor in the success of Illinois suffrage in 1913. After women got the vote, Bowen worked to register women voters and encourage women’s participation through voting and running for office. She herself almost ran for the Cook County Board and for mayor of Chicago. Bowen also used her influence as a corporate stockholder to influence policy and treatment of workers. In her autobiographical account, Growing Up With a City, she recounts how she \\"collected all my arguments regarding women working at night\\" and personally appealed to International Harvester Company president Cyrus H. McCormick regarding poor working conditions for women and the need for a minimum wage for women in his company's twine mills.  Additional civic involvement  Bowen's numerous additional civic roles included the presidency of the Chicago Woman's Club, and presidency of the Woman’s City Club of Chicago from 1914-1924. \\"Beginning with her presidency, the Woman's City Club's views on public policy were sought out by both city of Chicago and Cook County officials.\\" She also served as vice president of the United Charities of Chicago. \\"During World War I, she was the only woman appointed to the Illinois Council of Defense,\\" using her network of women activists to coordinate the war efforts of women’s organizations throughout the state. By appointment of President Warren G. Harding, she was the official representative of the US at the Pan-American Conference of Women(1922).  Honors and awards  Bowen received considerable recognition for her public service during her lifetime, including being honored as a citizen-fellow of the Chicago Institute of Medicine in 1939 for her long service to hospitals and health organizations,and receiving the first Gold Medal for Distinguished Service awarded to a woman by the Rotary Club of Chicago in 1941.  Personal life and death  Bowen married the banker, Joseph Tilton Bowen, in 1886. Their four children were John DeKoven Bowen (b. 1887); Joseph T. Bowen (b. 1889); Helen Hadduck Bowen (1890–1972), wife of William M. Blair; and Louise DeKoven Bowen (b. 1892). Bowen died of a stroke in 1953 in Chicago and is buried in Graceland Cemetery.

The West Philippine Basin is deeper and older than the eastern basins and has crustal heat-flow values approaching that of old oceanic crust.Watanabe, T., Epp, D., Uyeda, S., Langseth, M., and Yasui, M., 1970.

First proposed by Karig (1971), shows the WPB as forming by back-arc spreading behind the Oki-Daito Ridge starting the Eocene. Crustal extension within the plate took place successively in the eastern portion of the plate to form the other inter-arc basins. Supporters include: Lewis et al.

Early life  Nedbaylo was born on 28 January 1928 to a Ukrainian peasant family in village of Izyume. After finishing nine grades of school in 1940 he trained at the Kramatorsky aeroclub, which he graduated from in 1941. In May that year he entered the Red Army, and in February 1943 he graduated from the Voroshilov Military Aviation School of Pilots.  World War II  Having graduated from training in February, Nedbaylo arrived at the Eastern Front of World War II in March. He was placed in the 505th Assault Aviation Regiment, which was soon honored with the Guards designation and renamed the 75th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment on 18 March 1943. During a mission on 6 September 1943 he shot down a Ju-87 dive bomber over Vasilyevka raion. Starting in 1944, Nedbaylo flew missions with Anton Malyuk as his gunner. They flew roughly 100 sorties together, and on two separate occasions they were shot down. On 5 February 1944 while returning from a target over Nikopol in poor weather, they got into a mid-air collision with another plane, leaving Nedbaylo seriously injured. Malyuk and local infantrymen helped pull the unconscious pilot out of the mangled cockpit. Both aviators in the other plane, I.A.Okhtin and T.A.Tsvirkunov, were killed by the crash. With a fractured left hand he was sent to a hospital, but in less than two months he returned to flying. After Malyuk sustained a serious head injury on mission with another pilot, Nedbaylo began flying with Dmitry Matveev as his gunner. On 26 June Nedbaylo successfully led a mission that resulted in the destruction of Axis trains in Orsha-Tolochin, Vitebsk. During another mission he shot down a FW-190 over Vilkaviškis. During a mission in Autumn 1944, Nedbaylo felt a chest pain, but when he landed at his designated airfield after the flight, he discovered that he had been hit by enemy fire; he survived because the bullet had hit his parachute strap locks and flattened before it hit him. For flying 130 missions on the Il-2 he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 19 April 1945, and he was awarded the title again on 29 June 1945 for flying at total of 219 missions. During the war he executed a belly-landing, sustained serious damaged to his aircraft from enemy fire, returned to the airbase with half the tail of his plane gone, and was shot down three times. Originally a low-ranking pilot in his regiment, he rose through the ranks to the position of flight commander and eventually squadron commander.  Postwar  After the end of the war Nedbaylo remained in the military, and participated in the victory day parade. In 1951 he graduated from the Air Force Academy in Monino. From then until December 1953 he was the deputy head of the Supreme Officer's Flight School. He then became a lecturer of combat training at the academy in Monino, and in November 1956 he became the chief of staff of an aviation regiment. In December 1957 he was placed in charge of the department of tactics and military history at the Kharkov Higher Military Command School, but in October 1960 he was switched to the department of military history at the facility's School of Engineering. In 1962 he became the deputy head of the Kazan Higher Command Engineering School, after which he was part of the faculty at the Riga Higher Military Command School starting in 1964. He was the deputy superintendent of the Kiev Higher Air Force Engineering Academy from 1968 until his retirement in 1983. He was promoted to the rank lieutenant-colonel in 1949 and colonel in 1954 before he became a General-major of Aviation in 1970.

Although little is known about his personal life he was an important figure of the First Crusade. Governor of Antakya In the 1080s most of Anatolia and Syria were ruled by two relatives of the Great Seljuk Empire sultan Malik-Shah I: Anatolia was ruled by Suleiman ibn Qutulmish, the sultan's cousin, and Syria by Tutush I the sultan's brother. Between the two regions, Antakya (Antioch) was still a Byzantine fort and both rulers were trying to capture the city. Suleiman succeeded in conquering the city from the Byzantines in 1085 on behalf of Malik-Shah I, and Yağısiyan was appointed as the governor of the city by the sultan the following year.http://www.enfal.de/starih9.htm Conquest of Antakyal Malik-Shah I died in 1092, and his brother at Damascus Tutush I granted Yağısiyan more territory around Manbij and Turbessel. When Tutush died in 1095, his sons, Ridwan and Duqaq, fought for control of Syria, claiming Aleppo and Damascus respectively. Yağısiyan, being the governor of a nearby city, became heavily involved in the ensuing power struggle in Syria. Although he collaborated with Ridwan to capture Urfa (Edessa) in 1096, next year he changed sides and supported Duqaq against Ridwan and his ally Sökmen.Islam Encyclopedia vol 43, p.178 But his army was defeated. He had to accept Rıdwan’s supremacy. Later in 1097, Ridwan quarreled with his tutor Janah ad-Dawla, with whom Yağısiyan had a personal vendetta, and Yağısiyan became more amenable to an alliance. This was completed by marrying his daughter to Ridwan. The two were about to attack Shaizar when news of the crusade arrived, and all parties retreated to their own territories to prepare for the coming attacks. First Crusade When the news about the approaching army of the First Crusade reached Antakya, Yağısıyan tried to form a united front to defend Antakya. But because of jealousies between the Seljuk governors and the anarchy in the main sultanate after the death of Malik-Shah, he got very little support.Encyclopædia Britannica Expo 70 ed.,Vol VI p.829 Sökmen, whose principality was far to the east and far from the crusades’ route, refused to assist Yağısıyan. Even Ridwan, whose domain was next to Antakya, sent only a small number of troops. According to David Nicolle mistrust between Yağısiyan and Ridwan influenced the First Crusade.Nicoılle ,p.18 Over the winter of 1097-1098, Antioch was besieged by the Crusaders, and Yağısiyan sought help from Duqaq. He frequently sent out sorties against the Christian camp and attacked foraging parties further afield. Yağısiyan knew from his informants that there were dissensions among the Christians; both Raymond IV of Toulouse and Bohemund of Taranto wanted the city for themselves. While Bohemund was away foraging on December 29, 1097, Raymond attacked but was pushed back by Yağısiyan's troops. On December 30, reinforcements from Duqaq were defeated by Bohemund's foraging party and retreated to Homs. Only after the beginning of the siege did Ridwan decide to leave Aleppo and challenge the crusaders. Ridwan's army was defeated in a battle fought on 8–9 February 1098.Nicolle p.55 While the crusader army was away from the city fighting Ridwan, Yağısiyan marched out to attack the foot-soldiers left behind to defend the camp, but he too was pushed back when the victorious crusaders returned. In March Yağısiyan ambushed the crusaders who were bringing wood and other material back from the port of St. Simeon; when the crusader camp at Antioch heard that Raymond and Bohemund had been killed, there was mass confusion, and Yağısiyan attacked the rest of the army under Godfrey of Bouillon. Bohemund and Raymond soon returned and Yağısiyan was once more pushed back into the city. At this time the governor turned to Kerbogha of Mosul for help. The crusaders knew they had to take the city before Kerbogha's reinforcements arrived.Yücel- Sevim, p.8 Bohemund secretly negotiated with one of Yağısiyan's guards, an Armenian convert named Firouz, and on June 3 he helped Bohemund's men to open the gates of the city to crusaders. Death On the night of June 3, 1098, the crusaders entered the city; Yağısiyan fled with his bodyguard, while his son Shams ad-Daulah stayed behind to defend the citadel. During his escape, Yağısiyan fell from his horse, and as his guards found it impossible to bring the injured governor with them, they left him on the ground and rode away without him. He was found by an Armenian who cut off his head and sent it as a gift to Bohemund. Aftermath Antakya surrendered on 30 June.Yücel-Sevim, p.8 Antioch was claimed by both Bohemund and Raymond, with Raymond stationed in Yağısiyan's residence and Bohemund in the citadel. Their quarrel delayed the crusade for many months. However, Bohemund finally won out the argument, and thus declared the creation of the Principality of Antioch, which went on to exist for another 170 years. The crusaders recorded Yağısiyan's name in various forms in Latin, including Acxianus, Gratianus, and Cassianus; the residence claimed by Raymond was known as the palatium Cassiani.

If a flanking maneuver succeeds, the opposing force would be surrounded from two or more directions, which significantly reduces the maneuverability of the outflanked force and its ability to defend itself. Flanking maneuvers played an important role in nearly every major battle in history, and have been used effectively by famous military leaders like Hannibal, Julius Caesar, Khalid ibn al- Walid,A.I. Akram (1970). The Sword of Allah: Khalid bin al-Waleed, His Life and Campaigns. National Publishing House. Rawalpindi. . Napoleon, Saladin, Nader Shah, William Tecumseh Sherman and Stonewall Jackson throughout history. Sun Tzu's The Art of War strongly emphasizes the use of flanking, although it does not advocate completely surrounding the enemy force as this may induce it to fight with greater ferocity if it cannot escape.The Art of War Section VII, 36 A flanking maneuver is not always effective, as the flanking force may itself be ambushed while maneuvering, or the main force is unable to pin the defenders in place, allowing them to turn and face the flanking attack. Ancient warfare Battle of Salamis right During the second Persian invasion of Greece, after great losses at the Battle of Thermopylae and the Battle of Artemisium, the Greeks once again brought the Persians to blows in the Battle of Salamis in the year 480 BC. The Greek fleet numbered 378 triremes while the Persian may have numbered more than four times that.http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+toc Perseus online version However, in the narrow confines of the straits, the numerical superiority of the Persians became an active hindrance. The Persians became disorganized in the cramped straits, and the Greeks were in a position to flank from the northwest. Retreating Persian ships were befouled by the approaching second and third lines who were advancing to the line of battle. In the aftermath of the battle, Xerxes retreated to Asia with the majority of his army. In his wake he left Mardonius, who would be decisively defeated by the Greek army the following year in the Battle of Plataea. Battle of Leuctra In 371 BC, the armies of Sparta and Thebes gave battle near the city of Leuctra, despite the superior numbers and fearful reputation of the Spartan army, the unbalanced Theban attack, with the Sacred Band of Thebes on the extreme left and in echelon formation disorganized the Spartan lines and spread confusion in its army. Before even the extreme Spartan right wing had entered the fray, the battle was lost for them. It was Epaminondas greatest triumph and shattered the myth of Spartan invincibility. The Battle of Leuctra has become the archetypal example of a flanking attack since. It inspired the adoption of the echelon formation by the Macedonian armies of Philip II and Alexander the Great. Battle of Cannae Initial deployment and Roman attack (in red) In 216 BC Hannibal accomplished one of the most famous flanking maneuvers of all history at the Battle of Cannae. Using a double flanking maneuver known as a Pincer movement, Hannibal managed to surround and kill nearly the entirety of a larger Consular Roman Army. The defeat sent the Roman Republic into complete disarray Livy. The History of Rome by Titus Livius: Books Nine to Twenty-Six, trans. D. Spillan and Cyrus Edmonds. London: Henry G. Bohn, 1868. and remains a singular example of outstanding tactical leadership. As military historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge wrote: Battle of Pharsalus The routing of Pompey's Cavalry at the Battle of Pharsalus In 48 BC at the Battle of Pharsalus, Julius Caesar faced the army of Pompey, which not only outnumbered his more than four to one, but was also in more or less friendly territory. Conversely, Caesar's own army, due to his blocked crossing of the Adriatic Sea, had been cut in half as well as cut off from their supply lines. The rest of the army lay on the opposing shores of the Adriatic, unable to aid their comrades.Plutarch Pompey 65.5, Dryden translation: p. 465. Anticipating a turning of his flank, Caesar had hidden a line of reserves in this area. When Pompey turned Caesar's cavalry, rather than finding a route through which to attack his enemy in the rear, he encountered 2,000 legionnaires. These were armed with pila, normally a missile weapon such as a javelin, but the legionnaires used their length as a stabbing anti-cavalry weapon instead. Having turned back the flank of his enemy, Caesar now found his own open flank, which he used to route the army of Pompey.Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Civili, III 89,2http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/455221/Battle-of-Pharsalus After his defeat, Pompey fled to Egypt, and the battle marked the effective end of the Wars of the First Triumvirate. Early modern warfare Battle of Garigliano On 29 December 1503, the Spanish army of Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba crossed the River Garigliano using an upriver pontoon bridge to defeat the French army. The outnumbered Spaniard and Italian troops left the main army in front of the same positions they had keep against the French army of the Marquis of Saluzzo. The bold maneuver of the Gran Capitán spread terror in the demoralized French army that began to retreat. The Spanish main body, led by Andrade and Mendoza, crossed the river in front of the retreating army and transformed the retreat into a rout. Despite Chevalier Bayard brave rearguard actions at Mola bridge, the French army was forced to seek refuge in Gaeta where the surrendered a few days later. This victory and the previous one at the battle of Cerignola formed the basis for the fearful reputation of the Spanish infantry, the Tercios Viejos that lasted for more than a century until the battle of Rocroi. Nader Shah Early Battles Battle of Kirkuk Battle of Yeghevārd Campaign of Khyber Pass Battle of Kars Frederick the Great Battle of Rossbach Battle of Leuthen Napoleon Bonaparte Ulm Campaign The French invasion in late September and early October caught the Austrians unprepared and severed their lines of communication. The Ulm Campaign of September to October 1805 saw Napoleon Bonaparte engage in a monthlong maneuver aimed at severing Austrian lines and eventually capturing an entire Austrian army. The casualties were exceptionally one-sided for a modern battle, with the French suffering 2,000 casualties and the Austrians suffering 60,000, mostly captured.Chandler, David G. The Campaigns of Napoleon. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995. As Trevor Dupuy put it: > Ulm was not a battle; it was a strategic victory so complete and so > overwhelming that the issue was never seriously contested in tactical > combat. Also, This campaign opened the most brilliant year of Napoleon's > career. His army had been trained to perfection; his plans were > faultless.Trevor Dupuy, Harper Encyclopedia of Military History. p. 816. The aftermath of the campaign would quickly see the fall of Vienna, and the final exit of Austria as a member of the Allied forces. It is widely regarded as the inspiration for the Schlieffen Plan, as the world would see it unfold some 100 years later. The campaign would also prove the effectiveness of la manoeuvre sur les derrières, wherein a pinning force was utilized to occupy the enemy while a flanking force descended at the critical moment to decide the battle.Chandler, David G. The Campaigns of Napoleon. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995. Battle of Austerlitz By 1400 hours, the Allied army had been dangerously separated. Napoleon now had the option to strike at one of the wings, and he chose the Allied left since other enemy sectors had already been cleared or were conducting fighting retreats. The December 1805 Battle of Austerlitz is widely seen as a tactical masterpiece of the same stature as Cannae, the celebrated triumph by Hannibal some 2,000 years before.Adrian Gilbert (2000). The Encyclopedia of Warfare: From Earliest Time to the Present Day. Taylor & Francis. p. 133. . Retrieved 11 July 2014. Prior to the engagement, Napoleon went to great lengths to indicate to the Russians and Austrians that his forces were weak and he was on the verge of seeking a peace.Frank McLynn, Napoleon: A Biography. p. 342 He successfully hid the presence of some 75,000 troops from his enemies while still keeping them within reinforcement range, and even went so far as to retire, and give his enemies the confidence of occupying the high ground, as well as intentionally weakening his right flank.Chandler, David G. The Campaigns of Napoleon. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1995. Richard Brooks (editor), Atlas of World Military History. p. 109 The engagement resulted in the final exit of Austria from the war, and the expulsion of the Russian Army from the continental war. The French Army had lost about 13% of its numbers, while the Allies lost a full 36,000 men, 42% of their total force.French numbers at the battle vary depending on the account; 65,000, 67,000, 73,000, or 75,000 are other figures often present in the literature. The discrepancy arises because about 7,000 men of Davout's III Corps were not at the battle right when it started. Including or not including these troops is a matter of preference (in this article, they will be included as separate from the 67,000 French soldiers originally on the field). David G. Chandler, The Campaigns of Napoleon. p. 416 gives 67,000 (without Davout's III Corps)Allied numbers at the battle vary depending on the account; 73,000, 84,000, or 85,000 are other figures often present in the literature. Andrew Uffindell, Great Generals of the Napoleonic Wars. p. 25 gives 73,000. David G. Chandler, The Campaigns of Napoleon. p. 417 gives 85,000. In Napoleon and Austerlitz (1997), Scott Bowden writes that the traditional number given for the Allies, 85,000, reflects their theoretical strength, and not the true numbers present on the battlefield. Franco- Prussian War The Franco-Prussian War was marked by two devastating encirclements by the Prussian Army of the French. Although a spirited resistance movement continued in France for some time, these effectively ended large scale fighting for the rest of the war. Siege of Metz Following a loss at the Battle of Gravelotte, the French Army of the Rhine retreated to the defenses of Metz.Michael Howard, The Franco Prussian War Michael Howard, The Franco Prussian War Given their fortified entrenchment, the Prussians readily encircled the position and laid siege. The army would be forced to surrender two months later, but not before a doomed attempt by Napoleon III to rescue the Army of the Rhine. Battle of Sedan The Battle of Sedan In September 1870, Napoleon III had formed the Army of Châlons to attempt to relieve the 150,000 French troops invested at Metz. After losing a hard battle at Beaumont-en-Argonne, the Army of Châlons retreated toward Sedan. Exhausted and short on supplies, the French planned to rest in the town before reengaging the Prussian forces.The Nest in the Altar or Reminiscences of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 reprinted by Chapter Two, London in 1999, . Unfortunately for the French, the well rested and supplied Prussians split their forces into three groups, which they quickly used to flank and encircle the French, forcing them to fight the quite adverse Battle of Sedan. After staggering casualties, the force along with the king surrendered the following morning. Along with the surrender of the King, came the implicit surrender of the French government. Along with the surrender of the Army of Châlons, came the inevitable surrender of the force at Metz, which they were intended to relieve. The First World War Western Front German Advance Through Belgium The First World War began with one of the largest flanking maneuvers in military history, both in terms of the strength of the forces in the field as well as the vast geographic area through which they were deployed. Originally, the Schlieffen Plan for invasion of France by Germany called for a force of 1.36 million troops in a \\"scythe-sweep\\" through Belgium and into France toward Paris Ritter, G. (1958).

(April 2014). \\"Absolute Numbers: The Schlieffen Plan as a Critique of German Strategy in 1914\\". War in History (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage) 21 (2). ISSN 0968-3445 While the German Army did manage to successfully occupy virtually all of Belgium, the offensive became mired in a number of costly and indecisive battles, such as those in Yser and Ypres, and eventually was halted in large part with the First Battle of the Marne. In November 1914 Erich von Falkenhayn, who had replaced Moltke in September, informed the Kaiser that no great successes could be expected on the Western Front, and that strength, morale, and supplies were exhausted.Foley, R. T. (2005). German Strategy and the Path to Verdun: Erich Von Falkenhayn and the Development of Attrition, 1870–1916. Cambridge: CUP. . The eventual outcome of this strategy was the Race to the Sea, where a series of flanking attempts by both sides resulted in an unbroken line stretching from Switzerland in the south to the North Sea in the north. From this point forward on the Western Front, flanking became impossible and the war eventually devolved into a protracted war of attrition.Kaye, C.A. 1957. \\"Military Geology in the United States Sector of the European Theater of Operations during World War II\\". Bulletin of the Geological Society of America 68(1): 47–54, 1 fig. Sinai and Palestine Front On several occasions during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign the German and Ottoman forces were successfully outflanked by the mobile Egyptian Expeditionary Force. At the Battle of Mughar Ridge and Battle of Megiddo they were outflanked, while at the Battle of Magdhaba and Battle of Beersheba they were surrounded. The Second World War While the First World War saw the introduction of large scale mechanization in modern warfare, the lack of tactical experience of the commanders and the technical limitations of the weapon systems greatly limited their usefulness.Hart, Peter (2004) The Somme: The darkest hour on the Western Front. Cassell Military Paperbacks. For example, the Mark V tank employed by the allies boasted a maximum speed of five miles per hour and an operational limit of 10 hours under ideal circumstances. In the reality of the battlefield, this could be greatly reduced, and many tanks were greatly slowed or dead-lined by adverse terrain.Fletcher, David (2011). British Mark V Tank. Osprey Publishing. . However, by the start of the Second World War armies had been thoroughly mechanized and the available weapon systems had greatly increased their capabilities. In comparison to the Mark V, the M4 Sherman utilized by the Allies featured a maximum speed of 30 miles per hour and an operational range of up to 120 miles.Zaloga, Steven (1993). Sherman Medium Tank 1942–1945. UK: Osprey Publishing. . These increased capabilities revolutionized the battlefield. Whereas cavalry, the traditional flanking force, had been rendered moot in the previous war by artillery and automatic weapons fire, armor emerged in this new conflict as the mobile flanking force of the modern era. Invasion of Poland In the Invasion of Poland Germany utilized the speed of its mechanized strength to break through the flanks of, or between the flanks of Polish forces and into the interior of the country. The result of this was, rather than maintaining a front line opposing the enemy, the Poles found themselves in multiple isolated pockets with the mass of the German army occupying the original front, and the German mobile divisions behind their own positions. They were therefore unable to retreat, resupply, or be reinforced. Furthermore, as makes intuitive sense, a less mobile force finding itself in a pocket or salient, even if a breakout is achieved, cannot but find themselves encircled again. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  German Dispositions of the opposing forces on 31 August 1939 with the German order of battle overlaid in pink.

The ground campaign of Desert Storm during the 1991 Gulf War was characterised by the flanking attack of the Coalition forces, the massive \\"left hook\\" which avoided the Iraqi forces dug in along the Kuwait–Saudi border; but instead swept past them in the west. Once the allies had penetrated deep into Iraqi territory, they turned eastward, launching a flank attack against the elite Republican Guard before it could escape. The Iraqis resisted fiercely from dug-in positions and stationary vehicles, and even mounted armored charges. Unlike many previous engagements, the destruction of the first Iraqi tanks did not result in a mass surrender. The Iraqis suffered massive losses and lost dozens of tanks and vehicles, while U.S. casualties were comparatively low, with a single Bradley knocked out.Twentieth Century Battlefields: The Gulf War References Category:Military tactics ","title":"Historical examples of flanking maneuvers"},{"id":"46189303","text":"is a 1979 Japanese pink film directed by Mamoru Watanabe starring Mayuko Hino and Naomi Oka.

History  The first Minimal store was opened in 1973 by the Bad Homburg-based Leibbrand Group. The group, which also owned other retail chains such as HL-Markt, Penny Markt or toom, initially sold 50% of its assets to Rewe in 1974 and was bought out completely in 1989. The Minimal stores at first had a floor size of 800 to 1000 square metres, which was a considerable size at the time. Later stores had sales floors between 1200 and 1500 square metres. In 1990, the until-then West German chain expanded into the former GDR states; the first Minimal store in the East was opened in 1990 in Wanzleben in Saxony-Anhalt. During the years 2004 and 2005, Rewe converted most of its small-footprint chains (such as HL Deutscher Supermarkt, Stüssgen, Kafu and Otto Mess) into Minimal stores. Since them, the name Minimal did not only encompass the larger branches, but also small stores with a floor size from 400 square metres. This resulted in about 1,500 supermarkets carrying the miniMAL branding. In January 2006 Rewe Group decided to merge all its German full-service supermarket operations under a common brand name, independent of whether they had been chain stores or individually operated by co-operative members, of whom the latter already had been using the \\"Rewe\\" brand. The new branding strategy came into effect on the weekend of 25 September 2006, when 3,000 stores were switched over simultaneously, including all (German) Minimal stores as well as the few remaining branches of HL, Stüssgen and Otto Mess.  Minimal in Poland  The first Polish branch of Minimal was opened in 1996. In late 2006, Rewe Group switched over the branding of the stores to their Billa brand, common in Austria.

He went on to become a test pilot after the war, but was killed in a plane crash ten years later.  Early life  Parshin was born on to a Russian peasant family in Setukha village in the Tula Governorate of the Russian Empire. Two years after moving to Dnepropetrovsk in 1932 he graduated from his ninth grade of school, after which he worked as a metalworker. Having graduated from the Dnepropetrovsk aeroclub in 1936, he went on to attend training for flight instructors which he completed in 1937. He then worked at the aeroclub until 1938, moving on to attend parachuting school in Tushino, which he graduated from in 1939, after which he worked as a parachuting instructor at aeroclubs in Chuvashia, Bryansk, and Grozny. He briefly served as a flight instructor at the Sverdlovsk aeroclub of Moscow starting in April 1941, but left the post in June due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union.  World War II  Having joined the military in June 1941, Parshin initially served as a pilot in a fighter aviation regiment until transferring Chuvashia to work as an instructor at a flight school in August. In January 1942 he briefly served as a flight instructor for the 28th Reserve Aviation Regiment, where he taught pilots to fly the UT-2 and R-5, but later that month he transferred to the 65th Assault Aviation Regiment, which was renamed to the 765th Assault Aviation Regiment before it was deployed in February. Parshin quickly rose up through the ranks in the regiment, having started out as an ordinary pilot but being promoted to the position of flight commander and later deputy squadron commander in barely a year. During a sortie in September 1942 he was wounded in the leg, but after recovering he returned to flying and remained with the regiment until April 1943 when he left to attend officer training in Samara, which he completed in July 1943. Upon returning to the warfront in August, Parshin became a squadron commander in the 943rd Assault Aviation Regiment. The unit saw heavy combat in the battle to save blockaded Leningrad, resulting in him once flying five sorties in one day during the first wave of the offensive. Parshin frequently flew alongside his friend Andrey Kizim, who saved his life, shielding him from anti-aircraft fire and shooting down an enemy fighter attacking their squadron on 3 March 1944; just two days earlier, Parshin had been nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union for having flown 106 sorties. As a result of the intense aerial battle that took place that day, Parshin and his gunner were forced to make an emergency landing and bail out of their stricken plane after being shot down by enemy aircraft, leaving Parshin seriously wounded; during the aerial battle Kizim shot down a fighter attacking their squadron, but Parshin's plane was too damaged from the attack to continue on. The two were rescued by Soviet scouts in the forest who helped them return to their regiment. When he returned he was given a brand new Il-2, with \\"For Leningrad\\" painted on the side. During his first sortie on the plane he managed to shoot down an Fw 190, and he went on to fly dozens more sorties on it. Before receiving the title in August he continued to tally up sorties, and in July he began flying with Ivan Skripnikov as gunner. Later on 23 October 1944 he participated in a highly successful mission to attack a group of enemy tanks; despite being targeted with a barrage of anti-aircraft fire, he and his subordinates were able to strike his target, taking out four enemy tanks without suffering any losses. During the early phase of the East Prussian offensive Parshin flew 12 sorties in the span of five days, sometimes as many as four in a day, and on 17 February 1945 he was nominated for a second gold star for having flown 202 sorties. By then he had been promoted to the position of regimental navigator, and before the title was awarded in April he was made commander of the regiment. Despite his senior position, he continued to fly in combat, and by the end of the war he totaled 253 missions on the Il-2.  Postwar  Parshin remained in command of his regiment until April 1946, but in May he left the military. Initially he flew Li-2 and Il-12 cargo transporters, but he went on to become a test pilot, graduating from training in 1949. From then until 1951 he worked as a test pilot at a Moscow aircraft factory, where he conducted test flights on Il-12 and Il-28. Tragically, an emergency bailout from an Il-28 on 26 August 1951 resulted in the death of his navigator and flight engineer and left him badly wounded. As a result of his injuries, he was only allowed to fly dual control aircraft, so he became a test pilot at the Scientific Testing Institute of Aircraft Equipment of Zhukovsky in 1952. However, he died in a crash on 13 March 1956; he was piloting an Il-28 to film the mid-air refueling of a MiG-19 by a Tu-16, when his Il-28 went into an uncontrollable roll at an altitude of 3000 meters before crashing, killing Parshin as well as the cameraman and radio operator. The cause of the roll remains unclear. He was buried in the Vagankovsky cemetery.

His research focused on dynamical systems, the topology of curve families, complex function theory, and differential equations. In total, he authored over 30 research papers and 11 textbooks. For over thirty years Kaplan was an active member of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) and served as president of the University of Michigan chapter from 1978 to 1985. Early life Education Wilfred Kaplan was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Jacob and Anne Kaplan. He attended Boston Latin School and furthered his education at Harvard University, where he was granted his A.B. in mathematics in 1936 and graduated summa cum laude. Later that same year he received his master's degree at Harvard. Kaplan received a Rogers Fellow scholarship to study in Europe from 1936-1937, during his second year of graduate school. He was based out of Zürich, Switzerland where many of the mathematicians working on the applications of topology to differential equations were located. He also spent a month in Rome to work with famous mathematician Tullio Levi-Civita. Upon returning to the United States, Kaplan accepted a yearlong teaching fellowship at Rice Institute for the 1938-1939 school year, thus completing his graduate program. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1939 under the advisement of Hassler Whitney. His dissertation covered regular curve families filling the plane. Personal life While attending lectures at the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zürich he met a fellow mathematician, Ida Roetting, whom he nicknamed Heidi and would eventually marry in 1938. The couple lived in Houston for a year after their wedding while Kaplan taught at the Rice Institute. The Kaplans had two children, Roland and Muriel. Wilfred Kaplan died at the age of 92 after a short illness. Work Teaching and research After Kaplan's short teaching position at Rice Institute, he went on to teach at the College of William and Mary in Virginia for one year. In 1940 he was invited by T. H. Hildebrandt to join the faculty at the University of Michigan, after he had previously attended the Topology Congress. The mathematics department at this time was diminishing due to the effects of World War II. Enrollment was down and some of the faculty had been granted leaves to do military research. When asked to record his contribution to the war effort, Kaplan mentioned teaching math exclusively to Air Force pre-meteorology students in the spring and summer of 1943, as well as teaching Navy V-12 and Army ASTP students for the majority of the academic year 1943-44. In June 1944, Kaplan worked at Brown University as a researcher in an Applied Mathematics Group for the Taylor Model Basin, the Watertown Arsenal and the Bureau of Ordnance of the Navy Department. He continued his research at Brown for 17 months. In May 1947 he outlined a curriculum for a new Lectures on Mathematics Project sponsored by the Office of Naval Research. His early research focused primarily on dynamical systems, and the topology of curve families. In 1955, he became especially interested in complex function theory and made a significant contribution to mathematics in his study of a special class of Schlicht functions, for which he showed that the Bieberbach Conjecture held. His later research took on a more applied approach as he returned once more to differential equations, this time engaging in a more global analysis. In total, Wilfred Kaplan authored about 30 research papers. Kaplan was named assistant professor in 1944, associate professor in 1950 and full professor in 1956. His lectures were characterized by clarity and directness, a skill which allowed him to write several popular mathematics textbooks. An updated version of his Advanced Calculus textbook is still used widely today. A selection of Kaplan's books can be found in the bibliography. Kaplan taught a variety of undergraduate and graduate courses during his time at Michigan, and further advised eight doctoral students. Kaplan's skillful teaching won him respect among students and coworkers. Donald Lewis, chair of the mathematics department and co-author said, \\"First and foremost, Wilfred Kaplan was a teacher. He enjoyed conveying the beauty and usefulness of mathematics, and his students responded enthusiastically. He was a superb expositor, and his ability to elegantly convey mathematical ideas explains the enormous impact of his textbooks. When we were writing our joint texts, he never came to a meeting without a new idea to be incorporated.\\" One of Kaplan's primary goals as an educator was bridging the gap between pure and applied mathematics. He sympathized with the plight of engineers who felt the pressure to master more and more math concepts and then master the additional skill of applying it to their field. Kaplan wrote math textbooks specifically for engineers, such as Advanced Mathematics for Engineers (1981), because he believed teachers needed to work on presenting mathematical knowledge more efficiently to this group. Furthermore, he argued that science students in general, but specifically engineers, needed to be given other resources such as textbooks and articles to further their study outside of lectures along with the tools to employ those resources appropriately. He urged other textbook authors to use clear and simple language whenever possible, in order to “make the more advanced material accessible to those with limited background.” He also taught a class called \\"Mathematical Ideas in Science and the Humanities,\\" which focused on the use of math as an instrument to organize thinking about complex problems. More than just learning specific math content, Kaplan believed math was a medium through which to teach conciseness and how to recognize analogies, determine logical consequences of assumptions, and learn what questions need to be asked to tackle a given problem in any field. AAUP Wilfred Kaplan became a member of the national American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in 1946. He served as the vice president of the Michigan Conference AAUP from 1966 to 1968 and as president from 1969 to 1970. From 1973 to 1978, Kaplan served on the executive committee of the University of Michigan Chapter of the AAUP and took over as president in the years from 1978 through 1985. He continued being an active member even in his retirement, serving as executive secretary from 1985 to 2002. Kaplan received grievances from faculty members and supported collective bargaining (although the University faculty was never unionized). One of his primary concerns was retired professors on fixed incomes who were suffering under rising inflation. He sought to obtain a grant to provide the required financial aid. He also argued that retirees should receive more information about the health care options available to them, and he secured increases in maximum coverage and the annual reinstatement amounts allowed to retirees under the university health plan. In the 1980s, Kaplan wrote an extensive proposal for a study of higher education in the United States. He argued that there should be more research of the inevitable challenges that would arise and that the University of Michigan would be a great case study whose results would be relevant for many public universities. In the proposal he outlined a variety of topics to be explored in the study: the historical background of higher education including tuition rates, enrollment rates, and changes in social customs; a study of changing demographics; the economic need for college-trained people for the betterment of society; and a thorough account of the present resources available to higher education and how these could be modified for greater efficiency. In the 1990s, Kaplan's correspondence and reports focused heavily on the \\"grave difficulties\\" between faculty government leaders (members of the Senate Assembly) and the top administration offices, specifically President Duderstadt and Provost Whitaker. Many faculty grievances were concerned with the many decisions being made without faculty input and included complaints that President Duderstadt had only “modest interest in the views of others within the faculty.” Additional clubs/Memberships Kaplan was involved in a wide variety of other clubs as well. His interest in art lead him to become the president of the Washtenaw County Council for Arts. Kaplan also made a significant financial contribution to the ONCE Group, a group of artists, musicians, and film-makers known for their annual ONCE music festival in Ann Arbor; the group also spearheaded a film festival and a theatre ensemble in the 1960s. He was also a member of the American Mathematical Society (AMS), the American Physical Society (APS), and the Mathematical Association of America (MAA). He was on the State's Higher Education Capital Investment Advisory Committee although little is known about his specific role there. He was also Vice Chair of the University's Senate Advisory Committee on Academic Affairs, a subcommittee of the Senate Assembly. Additionally, Kaplan served as the treasurer of the Ann Arbor Unitarian Fellowship from 1972 to 2002. In his later years he was president of the University of Michigan Retirees Association. Awards Kaplan was named collegiate professor by the Board of Regents of the university from 1973-1975 for his accomplishments as a teacher. In 1984, he received the Good Teaching Award, from what was then called the AMOCO foundation, now BP Amoco. The award recognized excellence in undergraduate instruction and sought to incentive great teaching. While serving on the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs, Kaplan received their Distinguished Faculty Governance Award in 1986. Retirement Wilfred Kaplan retired in May 1986 after 46 years of service to the university. It was then that he received the emeritus distinction. Despite his retirement, Kaplan was still involved with the university. In the years to come he would receive several requests from the University Regents Commission to return to active duty to teach specific classes in the mathematics department. In 1990 he helped establish the Academic Freedom Lecture Fund (AFLF), allowing professors that were suspended or fired during the McCarthy era to hold lectures on campus. The film Keeping in Mind, an account of the mistreatment of the three professors who were suspended for their unpopular views during the McCarthy era, was played in the spring of 1989. After an audience member suggested the University make amends for its mistreatment of the three professors, the AAUP pursued this goal. First, university officials were contacted and a proposal was sent to the Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs in October 1989. The Senate Assembly established the Academic Lecture Freedom Fund which was funded, in part, by the national AAUP. Kaplan was on the AFLF's board of directors until his death. After his wife's death in 2005, Kaplan wrote a book titled Bill and Heidi: Beginning of our Lives Together, which was a translated composition of all their early correspondence before their wedding. Kaplan died on December 26, 2007 after a short illness. After his death, Walter Dublin, Professor Emeritus of Mechanical Engineering, wrote about Kaplan in a letter to the editor of the Ann Arbor News that Kaplan \\"worked tirelessly to improve the faculty--and, de facto, the university--by his work on many committees, work that spanned multiple decades. While he was a leader, he was never domineering, but always logical. Often, he would quietly remind his associates when they had strayed from their stated purpose or point out a legal or historical obstacle to what was being considered. He was always up to date and on the mark until he died, many years after he had retired.\\" Selected bibliography *Kaplan, Wilfred. Advanced Calculus. Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1952.

It was originally thought to have been native to the tropical western Atlantic Ocean and subsequently spread to other areas of the world such as Hawaii and the greater tropical Pacific, where it is regarded as an invasive species. The notion that it is native to the tropical western Atlantic was perpetuated from the fact that the type specimen, described by Duchassaing & Michelotti in 1860, was collected from the US Virgin Islands. It has subsequently been shown through molecular evidence that it is more likely that the species is in fact native to the Indo-Pacific and subsequently spread to the western tropical Atlantic most likely as a hull fouling species prior to its original description. Description Carijoa riisei is a colonial soft coral with a tangled, bushy growth form. It has hollow branches that may be long, growing from a creeping stolon. The branches grow by budding off the stolon and have eight longitudinal furrows and a prominent polyp at the tip. The calyces in which the polyps sit are tubular, widely separated on the branches, long and wide. The polyps are retractible into the branches. Distribution and habitat Carijoa riisei was originally thought to be native to the tropical and semi- tropical western Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Its range extends from South Carolina to Brazil. It is now thought to be invasive throughout its entire range in the western Atlantic Ocean. It has been found to be globally distributed and is found widely associated with shipping ports where maritime traffic is high. It was first detected in Hawaii in 1972 when it appeared in Pearl Harbor. Since then it has spread to the other islands in the archipelago. It has also been detected on many other islands in the Indo- Pacific, and on the coasts of Australia and Asia. It is a shade-loving species and grows on hard surfaces away from direct sunlight. These include caves, overhangs, ledges and under piers. It is a common hull fouling organism and will grow on metal, wood, concrete, plastic and rope. It thrives in turbid water with moderate to strong currents or wave action. Biology Carijoa riisei is an azooxanthellate species. This means that its tissues do not contain the symbiotic single-celled protists known as zooxanthellae to provide it with energy, as most species of coral do. Instead it needs to catch all its food by extending its polyps and expanding its tentacles. It thrives in turbid waters with moderate to strong movement which brings plenty of zooplankton and other food particles within its reach on which to filter feed. Individual colonies of C. riisei are either male or female. Gametes are liberated into the sea at any time of year, a strategy unusual among corals which mostly synchronise spawning with the phases of the moon. The eggs tend to sink which may mean the larvae are benthic rather than planktonic. Invasiveness In Hawaii, at depths below about , the invasive Carijoa riisei overgrows and kills the native black corals Antipathes dichotoma and Antipathes grandis. These are slow-growing stony corals with black skeletons, which are used for the manufacture of jewelry and are the subject of a managed fishery. The ecological balance is disturbed as the black corals are smothered by the faster growing octocoral and fail to reach a reproductive age (twelve years). The rapid spread of C. riisei in Hawaii may have been facilitated by the relative scarcity of native octocorals, a group that dominates many reef systems in the Caribbean and the Indo-West Pacific. The nudibranch Phyllodesmium poindimiei feeds on C. riisei, but it cannot be used in Hawaii as a biocontrol because, even under ideal conditions, the octocoral can grow faster than the nudibranch can destroy its tissues.Wagner, D.; Kahng, S. E.; Toonen, R. J.

Numbering and naming  This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 18 May 2019 (). As of 2019, it has not been named.  Orbit and classification  The orbit of , showing its inclination above the plane of the Solar System is an Apollo asteroid that crosses Earth's orbit. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.9–3.6 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,221 days; semi-major axis of 2.24 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.60 and an inclination of 34° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid never approaches Earth closer than 0.2 AU in the foreseeable future, but occasionally makes close approaches to Mars of 0.07 AU. It makes one such approach in 2073, at 0.067 AU, and another one in 2103, at 0.094 AU. Due to 's relatively high inclination, although it passes closer to the Sun than the Earth (0.9 AU), it never comes closer than 0.2 AU.  Physical characteristics  It is a carbonaceous B-type asteroid, relatively rare in the asteroid belt but common in the inner Solar System. Based on an absolute magnitude of 18.6, and an assumed albedo of 0.159 (derived from the B-type asteroid 2 Pallas), the asteroid can be estimated to have a mean-diameter of approximately 640 meters. If it impacted the Earth would cause significant damage, but not as much as the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event progenitor, which brought about a mass extinction, as it is only 1/20 to 1/10 the size. However, it is unlikely to come close enough to Earth to impact it, or even become a risk of impact.

After the second World War II, Plotnikov continued his Air Force career and rose to the rank of Major General and retired in 1975. Early life Plotnikov was born on 4 March 1920 to a Russian peasant family in Gonba village of the Altai Governorate. Having moved to the city of Barnaul in 1930, he graduated from his seventh grade of school in 1935 before going on to attend trade school and the local aeroclub. After finishing trade school in 1937 he was employed fixing cars until entering the military in 1938. Upon graduating from the Novosibirsk Military Aviation School of Pilots in August 1940 he was assigned to the 165th Reserve Aviation Regiment, but just a few months later he was reassigned to the 230th High-Speed Bomber Aviation Regiment. World War II Soon after entering combat as part of the defense of the Soviet Union in September he was transferred to the 277th Bomber Aviation Regiment. He was transferred again in January 1942 to the 459th Night Bomber Aviation Regiment, where he remained for then entire year. During his tenure in the night bomber regiment he faced multiple close calls but despite so went on to fly successfully. On 10 April 1942 sank a transport, and later that month he attacked a heavily-defended metallurgical plant in Mariupol in poor weather. During that mission, he was forced to turn the plane sharply to avoid enemy defenses, resulting in his navigator parachuting out of the plane after mistakenly believing that the plane was in a tailspin. Despite being without his navigator, he managed to return to his airfield. Barely two months later he took out eight enemy bombers on the ground. In April 1943 he became a flight commander in the 82nd Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment, which used Pe-2 dive-bombers; he was later promoted to deputy squadron commander. During the battle for the Dnieper he scored a direct hit to an enemy bridge on 21 September 1941, disabling enemy movement in the area for a long time. Later on 20 October 1943 he flew the squadron commanded by general Ivan Polbin; the flight consisted of 17 bombers with 14 fighter escorts. The mission targeted the Aleksandriya railways station in Kirovohrad, and due to the bad weather they were forced to fly below the clouds. After hitting their targets Polbin noticed incoming enemy dive bombers, and decided to attack them and their airfield as well. The 31 Soviet planes took on 46 German planes, destroying 13 of them, of which six were shot down by Pe-2s. For his role in the mission, which included shooting down a Ju-87, Plotnikov was awarded the Order of the Patriotic War 1st class. Later in Spring 1944 he took out two enemy crossings during one sortie, having made repeated passes at the target in addition to bombing railway areas of military importance. On 14 April 1944 he made a flight that reached the maximum range of the Pe-2 to reach far-away enemy territory; the mission lasted almost three hours. In May he was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union for having flown 225 sorties, and received the title in August. The next month he transferred to 81st Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment as a squadron commander. There he flew reconnaissance missions and went “free-hunting” for targets in addition to standard missions, often flying with captain Sergey Yashin. After surviving the attack in Breslau on 11 February 1945 that resulted in the death of general Ivan Polbin, he continued to increase his sortie tally, and 6 March 1945 he led a group of nine bombers in attacking the Lamsdorf airfield, taking out a fuel depot and 16 enemy aircraft. Later that month he was nominated to receive a second gold star for totaling 305 sorties, and by the end of the war he reached 344 sorties – 104 on the Tupolev SB, 203 on the Pe-2, and 31 on the Ar-2 and A-20 Boston, during which he shot down three enemy aircraft.

He played college basketball for the Xavier Musketeers and Western Michigan Broncos. During his two seasons of play at Xavier, Stainbrook was one of Xavier's leading scorers and rebounders.  Early life and high school  Stainbrook is the son of Dave Stainbrook who was a standout 6'7\\" football player (TE & OT) at Ohio University in the early 1980s and also a software engineer in the aerospace industry who once worked for NASA, grew up in suburban Cleveland. In a 2015 interview with New York Times reporter John Branch, he admitted to having been a \\"nobody\\" in high school; he did not start for his high school varsity team until his senior year. He initially planned to play at local Division III school Case Western Reserve University until receiving a Division I offer from Western Michigan University.  College career  Despite being almost completely ignored out of high school, he earned the starting center position as a freshman at Western Michigan. Notably, his first game was against Xavier, and he had 10 points and 7 rebounds in what proved to be a difficult 68–65 win for Xavier. According to Branch, Musketeers coach Chris Mack \\"wondered how the center—with his crazy hair, pads on his knees and elbows, and goggles on his face—had gone unnoticed in recruiting.\\" Ultimately, Stainbrook would transfer to Xavier after his sophomore season. Mack had some conditions before accepting him—he would have to cut his hair, stop wearing knee and elbow pads and lose 50 pounds (23 kg). Mack also wanted to remove Stainbrook's goggles, but relented when Stainbrook told him they were prescription goggles that he needed in order to see well enough to play. He went on to earn second-team All-Big East honors in his final college season of 2014–15, and was also one of the 10 finalists for that season's Senior CLASS Award. He averaged just under 12 points and 7 rebounds per game in leading Xavier to the Sweet 16. Following the season Stainbrook joined the Xavier track and field team as a discus thrower and shot putter, and competed at the Big East Track & Field Outdoor Championship at Villanova University. Professional career Stainbrook signed his first professional contract with the Crailsheim Merlins in the German Bundesliga on August 28, 2015. In July 2015, Stainbrook played with the Indiana Pacers in the Orlando NBA Summer League and the Golden State Warriors in the Las Vegas NBA Summer League. One year later, he moved to Spain for playing with LEB Oro team Cafés Candelas Breogán. In his second season, he won the league title and promoted to the top tier. On August 3, 2018, Stainbrook signed a two-year deal with Real Betis Energía Plus of the LEB Oro. On June 18, 2019, Stainbrook signed with Iberojet Palma of the LEB Oro after achieving two consecutive promotions to the Liga Endesa, being a fundamental piece in both teams. He averaged 3.9 points, 3.6 rebounds and 1.0 assist per game. On July 12, 2020, Stainbrook signed with TAU Castelló.  Personal  Stainbrook is the son of Nancy and Dave Stainbrook, and has two brothers. His father, Dave, played football for Ohio University from 1980 to 1985. His older brother Andy is 6'9\\" (2.06 m) and briefly attended the United States Air Force Academy, and younger brother Tim is 6'6\\" (1.98 m), attended Xavier, and played a major role in an episode that brought Matt a significant amount of national notoriety.  Driving for Uber  During his senior season in 2014–15, Stainbrook not only made news for his on-court play, but also for his part- time job as a driver for Uber. His journey to that job began the previous season when Tim walked on to the Xavier basketball team at Matt's suggestion. Matt completed a bachelor's degree in finance in May 2014 but still had a year of athletic eligibility remaining, and enrolled in the school's MBA program. Tim's undergraduate tuition was about $43,000 per year, while Matt's graduate tuition was roughly $14,000. Even though Tim was receiving a partial academic scholarship, the family would have paid considerably more in education expenses if Matt were on scholarship while Tim was a walk-on. This led Matt to go to Xavier's director of basketball operations and NCAA compliance director and give up his scholarship for his brother. Because he was now a walk-on, he was no longer bound by many restrictions that the NCAA places on student- athletes, most significantly those dealing with off-campus employment. In addition, he had wanted to live off campus, especially in his final season, but Xavier athletic department policy generally requires scholarship athletes to live in university housing; being a walk-on enabled him to fulfill this desire. While student loans paid for most of his direct academic expenses, he still had many other expenses to meet, and a schedule that made most normal jobs impractical. Having used Uber himself while at Xavier, he researched the requirements for becoming a driver for the company. He met all the requirements, with his 2004 Buick Rendezvous barely meeting the 10-year cutoff for eligible vehicles, and was accepted as a driver. During the basketball offseason, he drove for Uber anywhere from 25 to 30 hours per week, dropping his hours to 10 to 20 per week during basketball season. According to Stainbrook, \\"It [driving] sort of relaxes you. You get to talk to people who don’t always want to talk basketball all the time, so it’s a change of pace.\\" He mainly drove in the area of the Xavier campus, and he estimated that about half the people he picked up recognized him, at least by his face and size.

Archived from the original on march 27, 2015. was an African- American advertising art director and cartoonist whose 1970–1986 Quincy was one of the earliest mainstream comic strips to star an African American in the lead role. Early life and career Shearer was born in May Pen, Jamaica, to parents Samuel and Sophie (née Parnell), and raised from infancy in the Harlem area of Manhattan, New York City. Note: While TheCartoonists.ca gives 1921, the Social Security Death Index gives November 1, 1919. From a young age, his ambition was to produce a comic strip. While attending DeWitt Clinton High School, he met African-American cartoonist E. Simms Campbell, who became his mentor. At 16, Shearer sold his first cartoon, to the newspaper the New York Amsterdam News. From 1938 to 1940, he studied at night at the Art Students League, on scholarship. During World War II, Shearer served in the U.S. Army's segregated 92nd Infantry Division, reaching the rank of sergeant, and earning the Bronze Star for his position as art director for the division's magazine, The Buffalo.The magazine title was The Buffalo and not Buffalo as given in some sources, per He provided illustrations to the military newspaper Stars and Stripes and contributed comics about military life to the newspaper syndication service Continental Features. After the war, he began doing illustrations for magazines including The Ladies' Home Journal and The Saturday Evening Post, as well as Our World and Collier's, and in newspapers including the New York Herald Tribune. From 1946 to 1947, he studied art at the Pratt Institute. Advertising and comic-strip career Shearer's Quincy strip of March 8, 1971. Through Continental Features, Shearer syndicated two one-panel comics, Around Harlem, about teens and young adults in that Manhattan neighborhood, and the family-centered Next Door. After those strips were discontinued in the 1950s, Shearer joined the New York City advertising agency BBDO, where he served as an art director for 15 years, winning five awards. During this time, he sold single-panel gag cartoons to King Features Syndicate's Laff-a-Day feature. After a chance commuter-train meeting with King Features artist Bill Gilmartin, to whom Shearer showed some of his work and noted that his cartoons had been published in major magazines, an impressed Gilmartin brought Shearer's work to wider attention at the syndicate. Through King Features, Shearer launched the comic strip Quincy, starring an African-American elementary-school boy being raised by his grandmother in Harlem. It debuted on June 13 or June 17, 1970 (sources differ). Upon launching the comic strip, Shearer left BBDO. The strip ended with Shearer's retirement in 1986. Cartoon historian Bill Crouch, Jr. wrote that Shearer Another comics historian, Don Markstein, said the strip \\"wasn't preachy, the way pioneers of this type often wear their virtue on their sleeves. ... Shearer's characters were identifiably minorities in lifestyle as well as skin tones, and often derived gags from the fact, but weren't vocal advocates of change. Mostly, they were just a bunch of kids who got along together and didn't give much thought to their racial identity.\\" With his photojournalist son John Shearer as writer, Ted Shearer illustrated the book series Billy Jo Jive, which became the basis for animated segments on the PBS children's education program Sesame Street, and for an animated feature, Billy Jo Jive Super Private Eye, produced by Shearer Visuals in 1979. Late in life, Shearer exhibited as a painter in numerous shows. Personal life In 1945, Shearer married Phyllis Wildman, an attorney and, later, a deputy commissioner of social services for Westchester County, New York.

Geography Manjhaul is located at . It has an average elevation of 41 metres (134 feet). It has an area of 9.8 km². Climate The climate of Manjhaul is a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cwa) with high variation between summer and winter in terms of both temperature and rainfall. The temperature varies from 46 °C (115 °F) in summers to around 11 °C (32 °F) in winters. Summers are long, extending from early April to October, with the monsoon season occurring in the middle of the summer. Winter starts in November and peaks in January. The annual mean temperature is around 25 °C (77 °F); monthly daily mean temperatures range from approximately 09 to 34 °C (48 to 93 °F). The average annual rainfall is 1384mm of which 83% falls between Mid June and & Mid- October. Monsoon normally starts in June and lasts till October. The early monsoon currents, channelled to the NW are the principal source of rainfall of the region. 17% of pre monsoonal rains, which is spread in the different months of the year (specially in the months of November–December–January) have been explained as due to Norwester affect and rest during monsoons due to Himalayan affect. Heavy rains, supplemented by physiographic/geomorphic features lead to heavy flood.

It expands in a vast area of 64 square kilometres situated in the Manjhaul subdivision of the district. Jaimangalgarh is situated on the southern flank of the vast Kawar lake. Kaber lake is a shelter of hundreds of species of domestic and migrant birds. Birds from Siberia and Himalayan region can be seen here during winter season, period between September to April. The famous Ornithologist Salim Ali resided here for his research work and was influenced with life protection Act 197 and a proclamation was made by the government to develop it as a Bird Sanctuary but years have passed with the hope in the eyes of local people. Kaber Lake is major source of fresh water fishes which is famous for its delicacy in the region. Birds including different species of Cranes, Doves, Hawks, Fowls, Quails etc. and a variety of aquatic plants create a wonderful scene here in the winter and spring. Jaimangla Garh Jaimanglagarh is famous not only for its archaeological importance. It is a historical site related to the religious sentiments of people of this region. It has ample reputation as the Shaktipeeth. Goddess Jaimangalain local tradition is believed to fulfill the wishes of devotees. The sculpture of Vishnu is placed in another temple just in the northern side of the old Goddess temple. It is said that the area of the mound was entirely covered with forest, which was helpful in Tantra- practices. The vast Kawar lake touching the foot of the mound presents a remarkable landscape to the viewers. Overall the site has immense potency to be developed as a tourist place. On the one hand the Jaimanglagarh mound, the sculptures, the set of Herson stupa across the lake and the other smaller mounds surrounding it reflect its archaeological prominence, the vast lake, its Bio- diversity and its profoundness to be the shelter of thousands of migrant birds in winters proclaim it to be developed as an eco- tourist centre. Having such important sites in a periphery of only four square kilometres this site should be developed as a tourist complex. Jaimanglagarh Mound Jaimangalpur is situated on the southern flank of the vast Kawar Lake. It is popularly known as Jaimangalgarh. The topology and the height of the mound is remarkable. Jaimangalgarh is in fact a set of two mounds. The western part is separated by a channel from the main eastern part. The eastern has evidence of fortification. It is large in size. At present the temple of mata Jaimangala, for which the site enjoys the great popularity in local tradition, is situated on this southern part. The variety of potshreds can be seen everywhere on both mounds. (N.B.P. black polished ware, Redware etc.). It seems that the fortified southern part used to remain the residential premises of the royal family whereas the northern might be associated to officials. It is important to notice that there are few other mounds across the Kawar Lake surrounding the main mound. One is towards south while the other is towards East. The cultural sequence of the both mounds seems to be almost same and both of them seem to come into existence just after the main site. The Harsan stupa is towards East and at least another two mounds namely Kanti Dih and Sakra Bad lie in the same direction. In short, at least four smaller mounds and the stupa fall in the periphera of 2 km . Sculpture – Black stone, Pala period. Four handed Vishnu standing sambhanga. A well decorated crown over head. Ajamulambi Mala (garland), right lower hand exposed frontward in Abhaymudra while upper left holding the Shudarshan Chakra. Gada placed downward between the lower armpit. Upper left hand holding the shankha upward while lower holds the shrifala. Under this arm holding shrifala is sitting Garuda Dev in worshiping posture (Aradhaya mudra). The sculpture seems to represent the matured pala or Rajputa period. Education Manjhaul is home to a number of schools and colleges. R.C.S. College, Manjhaul is one of the oldest colleges of Begusarai District. Transport Railways Begusarai railway station is the nearest railway station. It's 17 km from Manjhaul. Notable individuals Ali Hussain (The Bird Man) Hailing from the Mirshikar community, Ali Hussain’s traditional occupation was bird-trapping which he sold to local and distant buyers. But a time came when killing of birds in his neighbourhood – in and around Kanwar lake in Begusarai was declared illegal and a traditional bird-trapper found himself being called a poacher and intruder. Hussain however continued with his old ways not able to find any other occupation he could excel at. Then again, another time in the 1960s, Hussain had an encounter with the famed Salim Ali. Salim Ali took the talented poacher under his wings as an assistant and what you then get is a scientist of the folksiest kind! Traditional bird-trapper to poacher to a scientist is indeed like having lived three lives in one. Hussain lives at Manjhaul village in Begusarai and assists scientists on projects. He can determine the sex of a bird through its feather, body movement and other characteristics. He knows the English and Hindi names of around 500 species of birds. Culture Festivals People of Manjhaul celebrate Chhath, Durga Puja, Holi, Diwali, Makar Sankranti, Eid al-Fitr, Muharram and many more festivals.

Many of the missions he flew were against the blockage of Leningrad. In June 1943 he was made commander of the 159th Fighter Aviation Regiment, which used the Yak-7B; that month he scored his last three confirmed aerial victories. The next month he was nominated for a second gold star, which he was awarded on 24 August 1943. That day, he was badly injured in a plane crash during a training flight. Due to the extent of his injuries he was unable to fly sorties for the remainder of the war. In total he had made 305 sorties, engaged in 38 dogfights, with 18 individual and 9 shared confirmed shootdowns; other sources credit him with more unconfirmed kills. Initially he continued to serve as a regimental commander, and in September 1944 he began he studies at the Air Force Academy in Monino, which he graduated from in August 1945.  Postwar  After graduating from the air force academy in 1945, Pokryshev was made deputy commander of the 7th Guards Fighter Aviation Division. In December he was made deputy commander of the 12th Guards Fighter Aviation Division. In May 1947 he was appointed as deputy commander of the 229th Fighter Aviation Division. He left the position in 1949 to become commander of the 44th Fighter Aviation Division. In 1952 he relinquished command of the unit, and in 1954 he graduated from the Military Academy of General Staff, after which he became deputy commander of the Minsk Fighter Aviation Corps. He was sent to China in 1956 as a military advisor, where he remained until 1959. That year, he became the chief of staff of an Air Army in Leningrad. He retired from the military in 1961, after which he worked at the Leningrad Airport. During his career he flew the Yak-3, Yak-9, La-7, MiG-15, and MiG-17. He died from drowning while swimming during a vacation on 22 August 1967.

As one of the few generals that regularly flew in combat, he was killed in action while leading a group of Pe-2 dive bombers on a mission. Early life Polbin was born inside a prison in Simbirsk on . Before graduating from his ninth grade of school in 1926, he moved away from his home town and in 1918 and worked at a railway station from then until 1920. After completing school he served as the secretary of a Komsomol Committee and worked at a library. Before entering the military he was a member of an aviation enthusiast group, but was initially considered unfit to fly because he couldn't move the pinky on his right hand. Military Career After entering the Red Army in 1927 he trained to become a platoon commander and was assigned to the 130th Rifle Regiment, but was soon placed on long-term leave in November 1928. While on leave he continued to dream about aviation and eventually resubmitted his request to attend flight school, which was accepted, so after re-entering the military in August 1929 he began training at the Volsky Aviation School. After graduating from the school in December 1930 attended the Orenburg Military Aviation School of Pilots for one year before becoming a flight instructor at the Kharkhov Military Aviation School of Pilots. He was then assigned to the 115th Aviation Squadron in July 1933, where he remained until his June 1936 transfer to the 102nd Heavy Aviation Squadron, where he flew the TB-3. In Spring 1938 he became a squadron commander in the 32nd High-Speed Bomber Aviation Regiment.  Khalkhin Gol  In June 1939 Polbin was deployed to Khalkhin Gol, where flew 19 sorties as a squadron commander on an SB bomber with the 150th High-Speed Bomber Regiment. His squadron did not lose a single plane in the course of the battle. After he returned to the USSR in September he remained in the regiment, and in February 1940 he was promoted to regimental commander.  World War II  Polbin's unit was deployed to the western front in July 1941 shortly after the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Despite his high position as regimental commander, he soon flew enough missions to be nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union, although the first nomination was lowered to the Order of the Red Banner. On 15 July 1942 he flew a very successful mission that destroyed a fuel warehouse in Morozovsk, which halted a tank advance. Less than a month later he was again nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union for 107 sorties, which was awarded on 23 November 1942; by then his unit had received the guards designation and been renamed as the 35th Guards Bomber Regiment, but he was no longer in command of it since he relinquished command of the regiment for a promotion in September. He held the post deputy chief of the Air Force bomber and reconnaissance aircraft inspectorate from September to November 1942, and from then until January he was the deputy chief of flight inspection. Before becoming the commander of the 301st Bomber Aviation Division in February, he studied and perfected flight tactics for missions on the Pe-2 dive bomber. Despite the weaker air brakes on the Soviet Pe-2 compared to the German Ju 87, Polbin managed to achieve an 80° dive angle — something very few other pilots were able to replicate. He taught other pilots how to fly the Pe-2, instructing them in both on-ground training and while flying with new pilots in practice flights. After becoming a divisional commander he continued to train pilots in addition to flying combat missions, even after he became the commander of the 1st Bomber Aviation Corps; the unit received the guards designation in May 1944 and was renamed as the 2nd Guards Bomber Aviation Corps, and in December that year it was renamed again as the 6th Guards Bomber Aviation Corps. During his combat missions he attacked Axis train stations, airfields, and other targets as well as engaging German dive bombers. One day before his death he was nominated for a second gold star for having flown 157 combat sorties and participated in major battles including the ones for Moscow, Smolensk, Stalingrad, Kursk, Kharkhov, the Dniepr, Kirovograd, and Lviv. On 11 February 1945 he was killed in action over Wrocław when the Pe-2 he was flying was shot down by an anti-aircraft projectile launched from a German target while making his fourth pass at the target in poor weather. Only the gunner/radio operator survived since he was able to parachute out before the stricken plane crashed. He was briefly detained by enemy forces, but soon freed due to the advancing Soviet troops. Polbin flew a total of 158 sorties, of which 92 were on the SB, 53 on the Pe-2, 10 on the A-20, and 3 on the Pe-3.

Calling for the abolition of slavery and the redistribution of land, the rebel \\"Bahia Republic\\" fought against the government for one year until their capital of Salvador was conquered.  History  Brazil's Bahia state had a history of rebellions, starting with the conquest of Bahia in 1798, Bahia's resistance to Brazil following the Brazilian War of Independence in 1822–1823, the Federation of Guanais in 1832, and the 1835 Malê Revolt. After the 1837 resignation of regent Diogo Antônio Feijó of the Empire of Brazil, military officer Francisco Sabino rose up in rebellion, calling for the abolition of slavery and the redistribution of land. The rebel forces were mostly disenfranchised lower-class people and escaped slaves from the southern provinces. However, the rebels received support from the knowledge of traitorous generals that shared their knowledge of the southern province's geography to the cause. The Brazilian government dispatched forces to subdue the Sabinada revolt, but many of the loyalist troops deserted to join the rebels. The rebels took over the regional capital of Salvador, but they found little support, even from the slaves. In March 1838, Salvador was blockaded and besieged by the government, and about 1,000 people perished in the fighting. Some leaders were executed, some were exiled to remote places like Mato Grosso, and some managed to escape and fight in the Ragamuffin War for the Riograndense Republic.

He enlisted in a French infantry regiment in 1770 and transferred into the cavalry in 1776. Thereafter he served in several different cavalry and infantry regiments. From sous-lieutenant in 1791, he served in the Army of the Moselle and was rapidly promoted to general of brigade by August 1793. After briefly commanding an infantry division in the Army of the Rhine at Wissembourg he switched back to the Army of the Moselle to fight at Kaiserslautern before being wounded at Froeschwiller in December 1793. Promoted to general of division in March 1794, Dubois led a cavalry division in the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse at Lambusart, Fleurus and Aldenhoven. In May 1795 he helped put down the Revolt of 1 Prairial Year III. After garrison duty he was able to get transferred to Italy. He was fatally hit while leading the cavalry at the Battle of Rovereto and died the same day. His surname is one of the names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe, on Column 25. Early career Dubois was born on 27 January 1754 at Guise in what later became the Aisne department in France. He joined the Lyonnais Infantry Regiment of French Royal Army on 16 August 1770. He transferred into the Monsieur Dragoon Regiment on 6 June 1776, followed by subsequent moves into the Royal-Normandie Cavalry Regiment on 22 December 1777 and the 5th Chevau- léger Regiment on 28 May 1779. He was promoted to brigadier, a non- commissioned officer rank, on 5 April 1780. He joined the Quercy Infantry Regiment on 25 July 1784 and was appointed maréchal de logis on 16 September the same year. He advanced to maréchal de logis en chef on 16 June 1785 and to adjutant on 29 December 1786. He became port-guidon (guidon bearer) in the 11th Chasseurs à Cheval Regiment on 15 May 1788.Charavay (1893), p. 38. War: 1791–1793 Soon after the French Revolution Dubois advanced into the lesser grades of officer. He was promoted to sous-lieutenant on 1 March 1791, first lieutenant on 17 June 1792 and captain on 5 August the same year. In 1792 he fought with the Army of the Moselle. He assumed the rank of lieutenant colonel in the 17th Dragoons on 26 January 1793. He was promoted to chef de brigade (colonel) of the 1st Regiment of Liberté Hussars on 28 May 1793 and he became general of brigade on 24 August 1793. For part of the year he was deputy chief of staff in the Army of the Ardennes. Lazare Hoche The First Battle of Wissembourg found Dubois in command of the Right Wing of the Army of Rhine. His brigade commanders were Claude Ignace François Michaud and Claude Juste Alexandre Legrand. The Right wing included two battalions of the 37th Line Infantry and single battalions of the 11th Light, 40th, 75th and 79th Line Infantry. There were 10 National Guard battalions plus the 4th Dragoons and 2nd Chasseurs à Cheval. The French government dismissed the previous army commander but none of the generals wanted the post because they had seen such generals as Adam Philippe Custine and Jean Nicolas Houchard sent to the guillotine. In desperation, the representatives on mission selected Jean Pascal Carlenc, a good cavalry officer but incompetent as commander-in-chief. To add more trouble, on 10 October the army's chief of staff Henri Jacques Guillaume Clarke was dismissed for suspected sympathy with aristocrats. In the midst of this chaos, the 43,185-strong Coalition army under Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser attacked on 13 October 1793. Dubois did not distinguish himself, withdrawing from his position when it was unnecessary. Carlec refused to order a counterattack unless authorized to do so by the political representatives, so the army fell back almost to Strasbourg. Dubois was replaced by Louis Desaix.Phipps (2011b), pp. 73–74. The Army of the Moselle also suffered from disruptive changes of army leaders. On 31 October 1793 Lazare Hoche replaced its acting commander.Phipps (2011b), p. 79. The new leader was handicapped by the arrest and dismissal of so many generals. Evidently Hoche thought favorably toward Dubois because he wrote at this time, \\"[Jean René] Moreaux and Dubois have just arrived; [Édouard] Huet and [François Joseph] Lefebvre, recently promoted, have begun work: these four generals will much relieve me.\\"Phipps (2011b), p. 89. Dubois led the army's Advance Guard in the Battle of Kaiserslautern on 28–30 November. His force consisted of 12 field guns in two horse artillery companies, four squadrons each of the 1st Carabiniers-à- Cheval and 1st Dragoons, three squadrons of the 3rd Hussars, one squadron of the 7th Hussars, five infantry companies and three half-squadrons from various cavalry units.Smith (1998), p. 62. Water-logged roads kept Hoche's main body out of action on the 28th, but Dubois joined one of Jean-Jacques Ambert's brigades in a morning assault on 29 November. After suffering many casualties, the French crossed the Otterbach stream and advanced against the main Prussian position. Over the next two days, the French attacks failed and Hoche was compelled to order a retreat. Dubois was hit in the leg by a musket ball in the Battle of Froeschwiller on 22 December 1793. In this engagement, the Army of the Moselle turned Wurmser's right flank and forced him to retreat from his defenses at Haguenau and along the Moder River.Phipps (2011b), p. 99. War: 1794–1796 Dubois is on Column 25 at left. Dubois was provisionally appointed general of division on 10 March 1794. This promotion was confirmed on 30 March. He arrived at Guise to take command of the cavalry brigades from the divisions of Antoine Balland and Jacques Gilles Henri Goguet. Dubois attempted to impose discipline on the unruly and riotous regiments. Unfortunately the organizations were changing constantly, preventing him from accomplishing much. After Goguet was assassinated by his own troops on 21 April, Dubois took over the division.Phipps (2011a), p. 290. On 4 May, Dubois' division counted 11,353 soldiers and was posted at Bohéries Abbey near Guise. Balland's 12,701-man division and Dubois' division made up the center of the Army of the North under Jacques Ferrand.Dupuis (1907), p. 80. After 10 May, the brigade of Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul was sent to the right wing of the Army of the North. On 26 May, Dubois left with a second cavalry brigade to join the right wing at Maubeuge. He took command of a cavalry division assembled at Ham-sur- Heure on 10 June 1794. The 2,315 troopers were divided into brigades under Hautpoul and Guillaume Soland, each with a horse artillery battery attached. Hautpoul led the 12th Dragoons (406), 2nd Hussars (265) and 6th Chasseurs-à- Cheval (624) while Soland led the 6th Cavalry (550) and 8th Cavalry (470). Jean-Baptiste Jourdan On 12 June 1794, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's army crossed the Sambre River and the Austrian-held fortress of Charleroi was placed under siege. The cavalry of Dubois accompanied the infantry divisions of Jean Étienne Championnet and Antoine Morlot and took post at Ransart.Dupuis (2007), p. 284. The Battle of Lambusart was fought on 16 June and resulted in a French defeat.Smith (1998), pp. 84–85. Prince William of Orange who commanded the Coalition army attacked the French in four columns, with the main weight in the 1st and 2nd Columns against the French right flank.Dupuis (1907), pp. 290–291. The French left flank troops were successful against the 4th Column. As the 3rd Column under Peter Vitus von Quosdanovich deployed in front of Morlot's division, Jourdan ordered the cavalry to attack. Accordingly, Dubois led the 10th CavalryDupuis (1907), pp. 296–297. (of Morlot's division)Smith (1998), p. 86. and 6th Chasseurs-à-Cheval in a brilliant cavalry charge, capturing 600 enemy soldiers and seven cannons. Unfortunately Jourdan soon received news that his right flank had collapsed, causing him to order a withdrawal. Undeterred, Jourdan spent one day reorganizing his defeated army and then advanced across the Sambre on 18 June, reinvesting Charleroi. The Prince of Orange's troops took position at Rouveroy to the west of Charleroi while Johann Peter Beaulieu's division blocked the road to the north at Quatre Bras. The overall Coalition commander Prince Josias of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld dithered over what to do, then finally decided to help the Prince of Orange.Phipps (2011b), pp. 154–155. When Coburg's 52,000-man army reached the scene, it was too late; Charleroi had surrendered to the French. As on the 16th, Jourdan's 75,000 troops formed a semi-circle around Charleroi. In the Battle of Fleurus on 26 June 1794 Coburg formed his army into five attacking columns.Phipps (2011b), pp. 158–159. Dubois' cavalry was positioned near Ransart behind the center together with Jacques Maurice Hatry's infantry division.Phipps (2011b), p. 160. Again, Jourdan's right flank was swept away by the Coalition attack. Lefebvre wheeled back the right flank of his division and placed it under the orders of Jean-de-Dieu Soult. Some soldiers and cannons from the routed right wing rallied on it. Jourdan issued orders for a retreat but, finding that Lefebvre was still holding on, he countermanded the order. Championnet's division had just begun pulling out. Jourdan directed Dubois' cavalry to charge the enemy; the horsemen were repulsed, but Championnet's foot soldiers attacked next and regained their former positions. After a see-saw struggle on the left flank, the French managed to hold their ground there also. Coburg in person hurled his battalions at Lefebvre but every assault was beaten back. That evening Coburg conceded victory to the French and retreated to Braine-l'Alleud.Phipps (2011b), pp. 161–164. On 6 and 17 July 1794 Dubois led his troopers in clashes against the Coalition forces. He fought in the Battle of Aldenhoven on 2 October where he led the 4,000-strong cavalry reserve.Phipps (2011b), p. 185. He got into an argument with the supply department which caused a rupture with Jourdan. He left the army early in 1795.Phipps (2011b), p. 144. The Revolt of 1 Prairial Year III broke out on 20 May 1795 when a crowd of armed people, burst into the National Convention and assassinated a deputy. In Paris at the time, Dubois was given command of the capital's cavalry on the 21st. The next day soldiers under Jean-Charles Pichegru crushed the revolt. Dubois returned to the Army of the North where he commanded the Jemappes department. Chafing at this inactive role, he asked for a transfer to the Army of Italy to replace the slain Amédée Emmanuel François Laharpe; the request was granted. On 4 September 1796 Dubois was hit by three musket balls while leading his horsemen at the Battle of Rovereto. The fatally wounded general gasped out to Napoleon Bonaparte, \\"I die for the Republic. Do I have the time to know if the victory is complete?\\" DUBOIS is on Column 25 of the Arc de Triomphe.See photo of the Arc de Triomphe. The underline indicates that Dubois was killed in action.

She is a central figure in modern mermaiding and is an ocean ecology activist.  Early life  Fraser grew up in Australia. She made her first mermaid tail at the age of 9, inspired by 1984 film Splash. She began performing as a mermaid in 2003. She has been featured in photo shoots, advertising campaigns and on film. Her father, Andy, was a founding member of the rock band Free when he was just 15. He died in 2015.  Career  Her marine conservation activism has included campaigning against the overfishing and culling of sharks, dolphins and whales, and against unsustainable fishing practices and ocean pollution, often in conjunction with Greenpeace. She appeared in the ecological documentary The Cove, which won the 2010 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for its portrayal of the Taiji dolphin drive hunt. In 2013, she was featured in an underwater fashion shoot with whale sharks in the Philippines, designed to publicise the ecological impact of the shark-finning industry on the shark population. Also in 2013, she starred in a conservation film, Betrayal, to campaign against the hunting of humpback whales with which she freedived in Tonga. That same year she night dived while breath-holding at depth with manta rays in Kona, Hawaii, to raise awareness of their non-protected status. To highlight her ecological message, Fraser and Shawn Heinrichs released Manta's Last Dance, a video of Fraser's freedive performance with manta rays, just two weeks prior to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). The video, played to CITES delegates, is cited as having contributed to manta rays securing worldwide protected status. She appeared in the TV documentary film Great White Shark: Beyond the Cage of Fear in 2013, in which she freedived with a mature great white shark while wearing a mermaid tail but notably had no armour or cage. In 2014, she freedived on a film shoot with tiger sharks, unarmoured and without scuba gear, in order to highlight the Australian Government's policy of culling tiger sharks to protect tourists. The decision to cull was later reversed. Fraser also appeared on the Discovery Channel alongside Sharkanado's Tara Reid, where she was interviewed about her dive with tiger sharks and on 20/20 ABC News. In 2015 in Valencia, Spain, she delivered a TEDx Talk as part of the United Nations' World Oceans Day in which she explained her role as an ocean ecological activist.

Weisiger, Donald R. Traser, E. Randolph Trice and Margaret T. Peters, Not Hearers Only\\" (Richmond, 1986), preface The parish is proud of its longstanding evangelistic outreach tradition. History In 1831, several Episcopalians petitioned bishop Richard Channing Moore to create a church on Shockoe Hill, since both of Richmond's existing Episcopal Churches were on the other side of the growing state capital. In 1835, the first year of the publication of the Southern Churchman, they bought at lot at 5th and Marshall Streets and soon erected a Sunday School building (one of the founders, John Williams, a devout Irish immigrant and merchant had been Monumental Church's Sunday School superintendent). In 1837, they called Rev. Adam Empie, formerly rector of Williamburg's Bruton Church and president of the College of William and Mary to become their rector, and he held the congregation's first services that November. On April 2, 1838 they laid the cornerstone for their new church, which Bishop Moore (also Monumental Church's rector) consecrated on June 23, 1839. After Rev. Empie retired for health and financial reasons to North Carolina, the next rector was George Cummins, a powerful preacher and writer, who also supported the American Colonization Society. Rev. Cummins left to accept a position at Trinity Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., then in 1866 was consecrated assistant bishop of Kentucky, but he broke away in protest against what he perceived as the church's increasing ritualization, to form the Reformed Episcopal Church in 1874. The Richmond congregation's next rector, Joshua Peterkin (1814–1892), son of an officer from Baltimore who served in both the army and navy, led the parish from 1855 until his death 37 years later, assisted by several young priests, including his son, George William Peterkin, who became the first bishop of the Diocese of West Virginia.Don W. Massey, The Episcopal Churches of the Diocese of Virginia (Diocese Church Histories Publishers, Keswick, VA, 1989) at p. 157. Rev. Joshua Peterkin had been known for his solicitude toward African Americans, having first served at St. James African Church in Baltimore shortly after graduating from Virginia Theological Seminary. However, like his two predecessors, Peterkin owned slaves. This church was originally located about a block from Richmond's slave market and built a gallery for African American congregants. Nonetheless, like his Bishop William Meade, Rev. Peterkin believed in educating all races, and soon reestablished the school to teach African Americans which Dr. Empie had established in 1845. Rev. Peterkin's secessionist sermon in January 1861 prompted protest from Unionist lawyer and representative John Minor Botts. However, another parishioner Henry A. Wise (Virginia's 33rd Governor, serving from 1856 to 1860), as one of his last official acts, signed the death warrant for John Brown, captured after his raid on Harper's Ferry (then in Virginia). The St. James congregation, which had been Richmond's largest at the start of the American Civil War, lost many parishioners, including Gov. Wise's son (and brother of the assistant Rev. Wise), Capt. O. Jennings Wise (killed in 1862 under his father's command at Roanoke Island) and General J.E.B. Stuart (killed at Yellow Tavern near Brook Road and Richmond's outskirts in 1864). Parishioner Sally Tompkins established a private hospital to nurse Confederate casualties, and when those were outlawed, accepted a commission so her work could continue (thus becoming the Confederate army's only female officer, as well as being so skilled that only 73 of 1,333 soldiers admitted to her care succumbed to wounds or disease by 1865).Weisiger et al at 25–26 Rev. Peterkin's wife Elisa and daughter Rebekah Dulaney Peterkin, also helped nurse the wounded during the war, and remained active in charitable work in Richmond during the following decades. The church survived Richmond's Evacuation Fire in April 1865, but the devastation to the city took away the livelihoods of many parishioners. The Peterkins founded the first Virginia circle (chapter) of the International Order of the King's Daughters and Sons as well as the city's Sheltering Arms Hospital, to serve those unable to afford medical care for lack of both insurance and military pensions, consistent with the Social Gospel movement. Also, in 1875, parishioner Frederick W. Hanewinckel donated a home for the benefit of indigent Episcopal women, on whose board Mrs. Peterkin served for many years.Weisiger et al at pp. 34–35. In 1894, parishioner Mary Tinsley Greenhow founded the Virginia Home for Incurables, as well as continued the recently deceased Rebekah Peterkin's work at Sheltering Arms Hospital for decades. Rev. Peterkin, like his mentor (then assistant) Bishop John Johns, actively supported foreign and domestic missions. He and his assistants helped establish three other Richmond parishes: St. Mark's, Moore Memorial (commemorating Virginia's second bishop, but later combined and renamed Grace and Holy Trinity), and St. Philip's (Richmond's first black Episcopal parish, formed from members of the Sunday school and on North Fourth Street only blocks away from St. James).Weisiger et al at pp. 21–22, 28–31. The parish also founded a church mission to Brazil in 1889, sending James Morris and Lucien Lee Kinsolving (who became the first bishop of the Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil). Former assistant Robert A. Gibson would later become Bishop of Virginia, and former assistant James R. Winchester later became Bishop of Arkansas. view of St. James Episcopal Church as relocated to Stuart Circle After Rev. Peterkin's death, his successor, Rev. John K. Mason, advocated moving the church to the city's west end, the Fan District then being developed and the existing structure needing considerable repairs, even after donations made in connection with the General Convention held in Richmond in 1907. Rev. Mason accepted a position in Louisville, Kentucky, but after two prominent churchmen declined to become his successor due to the increasingly isolated location of the church (and the new nearby street railroad disrupting services), his dream was realized under his successor, Rev. William Meade Clark (who also served as editor of the 'Southern Churchman'). The cornerstone for the current building near Stuart Circle and Monument Avenue, was laid on May 17, 1912, and the future structure consecrated by Bishop Robert A. Gibson. Rt.Rev. George Peterkin also spoke. Under the next rector, Rev. Freeland G. Peter, a Men's Club (the Brotherhood of St. Andrew) and Business Women's Club were formed. The new building was consecrated in 1918, the ceremony having been delayed until the debt incurred in its construction was liquidated. Bishop Gibson officiated and bishop William Cabell Brown preached concerning the congregation's motto, with the President of the Episcopal Board of Missions, Rt.Rev. Arthur Selden Lloyd also preaching at an evening service.Weisiger et al p. 53 The Women's Auxiliary sponsored Margaret Monteiro, a Richmonder who became a missionary in China, from 1920 until she evacuated in 1948.Weisiger p. 56. In 1926, longtime vestry member Henry Lee Valentine donated chimes, named after the brotherhood of which he was a member, and whose daily peals became a local tradition. Rev. Freeland Peter left the parish to become canon at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., and his Maryland home became part of the National Institutes of Health. Rev. Churchill J. Gibson was the next long-term rector, serving from October 1929 until his retirement in April 1957 (shortly after the congregation expanded the Sunday School building and renamed it in his honor). Rev. Richard Royall Baker III, in addition to his duties in this parish and dealing with racial tension in the city, during his 21-year rectorship helped establish St. Martin's Church in Richmond, as well as cooperated with nearby Catholic, United Church of Christ, Lutheran and Presbyterian churches, sometimes calling the result Stuart Circle Parish. In 1986, under rector Frank Fagan, the St. James Children's Center opened, the only preschool in the city to welcome children with special needs.St. James Church, Sacred Plans, Blessed Hands (pamphlet at Library of Virginia) On July 13, 1994, lightning struck the church, destroying the altar and nave, leaving only its four walls standing. During an emergency meeting held that night at neighboring Grace and Holy Trinity Church, the vestry committed to rebuilding the church, remaining a vital ministry to downtown Richmond and the surrounding Fan area. During the parish's 150th anniversary celebrations, the congregation decided to alter a portion of the parish's seal—replacing a blank section with tongues of flame, which also allude to the parish's traditional devotion to the Holy Spirit. Under the leadership of then-rector Reverend Robert Trache, the sanctuary of the church was rebuilt and rededicated in 1997, and now includes C. B. Fisk's Opus 112, one of the finest pipe organs in North America. Following Mr. Trache, in 2000 the Reverend Randolph Hollerith was called as the 13th rector of St. James's. Under Mr. Hollerith, the church expanded its educational campus across Birch Street to 1133 West Franklin, incorporating and expanding two single family dwellings into The Michaux House, which serves as a meeting, classroom and community service space. In 2016, Mr. Hollerith was called as Dean of the National Cathedral in Washington. D.C. In June 2017, the vestry of St. James's called the Reverend Dr. John F. McCard of Atlanta's St-Martin-in- the-Fields Episcopal Church as 14th Rector of St. James's. Architecture The current building in Richmond's Fan District was designed by the Richmond architectural firm of Nolan and Baskerville in 1912, following the exterior design of its predecessor at 5th and Marshall as well as St. Martin-in-the- Fields in London. The same firm also designed Temple Beth Ahabah (where the congregation worshiped temporarily after the 1994 fire) and the Jefferson Davis monument on Monument Avenue. The women of the church in 1895 donated the brass pulpit as a memorial to Rev. Joshua Peterkin, although vestryman and Richmond sculptor Edward Valentine detested its \\"vulgarity\\". Several other pieces moved from the original to the new church did not survive the 1994 fire. Four original pews survived; the remainder are reproductions crafted in New Holland, Pennsylvania. Richmond's firefighters managed to save the nave's ten stained glass windows, four from the Louis C. Tiffany studios, and it also received three sets of 19th century panels (from the M.T.Lamb studios in Brooklyn, New York) from the Monumental Church, which was at the time being restored to its original state as a memorial to those who died in the Great Theater Fire of 1811. Also, in 1951 the United Daughters of the Confederacy donated stained glass windows memorializing General J. E. B. Stuart, and, a century after her death, another commemorating Capt. Sally Tompkins.Weisiger et al. pp. 25–26 References Category:Episcopal churches in Virginia Category:Churches completed in 1918 Category:Churches in Richmond, Virginia Category:20th-century Episcopal church buildings Category:Religious organizations established in 1837 ","title":"St. James's Episcopal Church (Richmond, Virginia)"},{"id":"46189698","text":"Corday Productions is an American production company.

It did not go into production. Design and development The two seat, open cockpit C.251 was designed to replace the ubiquitous Caudron C.59, dating from 1922, as an intermediate trainer aircraft. It was a single bay biplane with N-form interplane struts, its upper wing supported over the fuselage on a pair of short, vertical, N-form cabane struts. The slightly shorter span lower wing was mounted on the lower fuselage longerons a little above the fuselage underside and, unlike the upper wing had some dihedral. The wings had significant stagger but were of similar plan, with equal and constant chord except near the straight but angled wing tip. Only the lower wings carried ailerons. It was powered by a Lorraine 7Me Mizar seven cylinder radial engine which had a Townend ring type cowling and drove a two blade metal propeller with a conical spinner. Behind the engine the fuselage was fabric covered and flat sided, though with a polygonal underside and decking. The forward cockpit was under the upper wing trailing edge where a slight cut-out improved the pupil's upward view. The instructor's cockpit was further back. The C.251s empennage was conventional, with tailplane and elevators mounted on top of the fuselage and having a planform similar to the wins, apart from a cut-out for rudder movement. The fin profile was a shallow triangle; the rudder continued its upper line to a rounded tip and straight, vertical trailing edge. The C.251 had a fixed tail wheel undercarriage and the rudder was slightly cut away below to give the tail wheel leg room for movement. The main wheels were mounted on half-axles attached on the central fuselage underside and hinged on faired V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons. Landing loads were absorbed by legs also mounted on the lower longerons. The C.251 flew for the first time in the first half of 1931. That October it went to the military testing department at Villacoublay and was still there in January 1932.

Regular passenger service through Headland ended in 1929, although mixed service on freight trains continued through the mid-1950s. Freight service was discontinued in 1979. Despite efforts to renovate and repurpose the building, it was demolished after 1980. The depot was built of local pine and oak, and covered with a gable roof with deep, bracketed eaves. The western third of the building was divided into two passenger waiting rooms and the agent's office, while the eastern two-thirds was a large freight storage area.

She was born in Connecticut and shares her time between living in New York City and the Huerfano Valley in Colorado.  Paintings  Haynes is a conceptual artist. Her art-historical influences cite Marcel Duchamp, Mondrian, Dan Flavin, On Kawara and Ad Reinhardt, but as Marjorie Welish noted in her essay, “Nancy Haynes, A Literature of Silence”, Haynes’ also has influences from literature. Welish states: :“Nancy Haynes has produced a series of breath- taking monotypes inspired by the work of Samuel Beckett. That her admiration for him is long-standing comes as no surprise to those viewers familiar with her painting. She is aesthetically in accord with Beckett's assumption of \\"the divine aphasia,\\" or speechlessness, against which mark-making is inadequate (That Which Memory Cannot Locate, 1991-92). She evidently admires that same impulse toward (the Heideggarean) \\"inadequacy of language\\" in art other than her own (Robert Ryman's own homage to Beckett's, Ill Seen Ill Said, with its barely voiced \\"th\\" inscribed in illustration, for instance). Cognizant of Vladimir and Estragon's cosmic fretfulness, she conducts her own forays into elegant stuttering on the visual plane.” In Haynes’ recent paintings, the canvases began to “evolve from a paler shade of a given pigment to a darker one, creating a horizontal movement that pulls the eye toward an unseen source of light.” More notable works include her autobiographical color charts series (2005-2013), which employ swatches of color contained within grids, meant to give an autobiography of the artist.
