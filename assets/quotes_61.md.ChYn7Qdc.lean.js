Corporation was a small aerospace company in Pasadena, California, that operated from 1999 to early 2001. Blastoff! was one of dozens of Idealab's incubator companies, created to capitalize on the public interest in space travel and exploration.Buttigieg, Ralph. \\"More on the New Moon Race\\", Blog entry on 2007-09-15, retrieved on 2008-08-30.  Summary  The company Blastoff! Corporation was first formed as Spacelab in 1999, but was quickly renamed to Blastoff! to differentiate it from the NASA Spacelab Space Shuttle module. The company was developed and acted in secret throughout its short existence.DiCarlo, Lisa. \\"Incubators On Life Support: Idealab!\\", Forbes 2001-01-18, retrieved on 2008-08-30. The company‚Äôs mission was to do entertainment space missions: flights that would pay for themselves through the sales of advertising, media content, action figures, etc. thus, Blastoff! differed from other companies espousing similar goals in that it was decided not to promote its development work and that Blastoff!‚Äôs first mission was fully funded.D.P. Miller, D.P., Hougen, D., and Shirley, D. \\"The Sooner Lunar Schooner: Lunar Engineering Education\\" KISS* Institute For Practical Robotics Working Paper 2002 , retrieved on 2008-08-30. Blastoff!'s first mission rapidly evolved from an initial concept of human space tourism to its final plan of sending a robotic lander/rover to the Moon. The size of the company grew from less than ten employees in January 2000, to a peak of approximately 59 full-time employees in October 2000. Due to funding constraints, the company effectively closed down in January 2001.  Participants  The approximately 50 direct employees of Blastoff! came from different aerospace and non-aerospace backgrounds across the United States. Approximately 35 of the employees were engineers, with backgrounds from both small and large aerospace organizations. Other employees were responsible for financing, marketing, and famously the cinematography organization of the mission (this included recognizable Hollywood directors and producersNoland, David. \\"Rent-a- Rocket Rule Tweak Opens Up Field for Google Lunar X Prize: Update\\" Popular Mechanics, 2007-10-01, retrieved on 2008-08-30.). Many well-known aerospace companies were enlisted as subcontractors to provide most of the subsystems on the spacecraft.  L1 Mission  The only concept mission at Blastoff! was to send a robotic lander/rover spacecraft to the Moon. The proposed mission was named Lunar 1, or L1 for short. The robotic element of the mission would have three parts: a Rover, and two smaller Scouts. The L1 mission was to follow a direct lunar injection trajectory, rather than performing several Earth orbits prior to performing an engine fire to leave orbit. The launch vehicle contracted for the L1 mission was the last of the Athena series (prior to Athena's reactivation in 2010). The Rover was to contain all of the hardware necessary to navigate to the Moon, execute a soft landing on its surface, move overland to its destination, and communicate with the Earth throughout the entire mission. The Rover was similar in size to the two NASA rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) that successfully landed on Mars in January 2004, and had similar mobility functionality. The Scouts were to act as remote extensions of the main Rover craft, and contained power systems, video cameras and limited local communication systems that could only communicate directly with the Rover. The Scouts were about six by twelve inches and were deployed from the Rover after the Rover performed a soft landing on the surface of the Moon. The Scouts could be used in a reconnaissance function to identify upcoming travel hazards, and also performed a \\"third person\\" video perspective to show the Rover itself on the surface of the Moon. The destination of the Rover and Scouts was to be one of the NASA Apollo landing sites, most likely the Apollo 11 landing site (the first manned landing on the Moon). The mission was designed to land the Rover and Scouts as close to the Apollo site as possible at the beginning of that site's local lunar day. This would provide a two-week time period with continuous sunlight to power the Rover and Scouts before the two-week lunar night would effectively end the mission by causing the batteries to drain. Throughout this two-week period daytime period, the Rover and Scouts' location would be identified relative to the Apollo site, and the robotic craft would be remotely driven from the Earth to arrive at the Apollo site prior to lunar nightfall. The L1 mission and hardware design was developed and finalized through an engineering effort in 2000. An intense targeted marketing and funding campaign also took place during this time, but without adequate results to maintain company liquidity. A majority of the hardware to build the system had been ordered, and some had been received by the time the company shut down in January 2001. The L1 project was not perpetuated after the company's shutdown, and so the Rover and Scouts never were completed and launched.

Early life Grayden was born Wilbur Ives on 5 August 1920 in Bickley, Western Australia. He was one of three children born to Ethel May Harper and Aubrey Leonard Ives, including his younger brother David who also entered politics. Grayden's father participated in the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, and lost a lung after being shot by a Turkish sniper. The marriage broke up and his mother gave the children their step-father's surname after she remarried. Grayden was educated at state schools and then at Perth Technical College, as part of an apprenticeship commenced in 1938 as a motor mechanic with Winterbottom Motors. He attempted to enlist in the Australian Army when the Second World War broke out in September 1939, but was rejected. He succeeded the following year after lying about his age. Grayden joined the 2/16th Infantry Battalion as a private, but was soon promoted to corporal and then selected to attend Officer Training School in Bonegilla. He served on the Syrian campaign and then in 1942 was sent to New Guinea, where he took part in the Kokoda Track campaign, the Battle of Buna‚ÄìGona, and the Markham and Ramu Valley campaign. He ended the war in Borneo and took part in the Battle of Balikpapan. Politics=State and federal politics: 1946‚Äì1954 Grayden stood as an independent in the Division of Swan at the 1946 federal election. At the 1947 Western Australian state election, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly as the Liberal member for Middle Swan. He was the youngest member of the parliament. At the 1949 federal election, Grayden transferred to the Australian House of Representatives, winning the seat of Swan for the Liberals. He held the seat until his defeat in 1954. I State politics: 1956‚Äì1993 In 1956 he returned to the Legislative Assembly, winning the seat of South Perth. He served as a minister in a number of capacities: Labour and Industry 1974‚Äì1978; Consumer Affairs 1974‚Äì1978; Immigration and Tourism 1974‚Äì1975; and Education, Cultural Affairs and Recreation 1978‚Äì1982. Grayden left the Assembly in 1993. In total he served 43 years in State and Federal Parliament. He is the maternal grandson of Western Australian businessman and politician Nat Harper.

Their manufacture made extensive use of standard design features and components.  Development  Following the merger of the state railways (L√§nderbahnen) in Germany into the Reich railway in 1920 and into the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft in 1924, the locomotive fleet of the new national railway administration still had 210 different types and classes of steam engine. This considerably hindered the flexible employment of locomotives within the railway network, and servicing and maintenance was very costly as a result of the large number of different spare parts that had to be stocked. In addition, production tolerances of individual components were so small that, often, even components for the same class of locomotive could only be used after further finishing work had been carried out. On top of that, substantial reparations as a result of the First World War, 1914‚Äì18, considerably reduced the rolling stock of the German railways without regard to the variety of classes. Thus out of the 33,000 locomotives in the fleet (as at 1917), 8,000 had to be handed over. There was therefore a need to build new locomotives and to introduce a sensible degree of standardisation in procuring these new engines. To that end a locomotive standards committee was convened by the Reichsbahn. Even representatives of the locomotive industry took part in this standardisation process. Initially the question was posed as to whether proven state railway classes should continue to be built or whether new, modern locomotives should be developed and ordered. Because the basic concepts for the new locomotives had not been decided, however, and in order to give the locomotive factories follow-on orders, it was decided in 1921 to continue to build proven state railway classes to begin with. These classes were given new Reichsbahn classifications. Amongst them were the Prussian P 8 (Class 38.10), the Prussian P 10 (Class 39), the Prussian G 12 (Class 58.10) and the Prussian T 20 (Class 95), all of which continued to be manufactured until 1925. The Bavarian S 3/6 (Class 18.5) was even procured right up to 1930. The Prussian G 12 (Class 58.10), which was not developed until 1917, effectively counted as the first German Einheitslok, because it was employed by almost all the state railways and built by several locomotive factories across the whole Reich. Technical and economic factors, as well as the Reichsbahn's aim of improving main lines to handle a standard axle load of 20 tons, led to the decision to develop new types of locomotive. After heated debates in the locomotive committee (e.g. about the design of the boilers and fireboxes as well as the choice between two-cylinder layouts or four-cylinder compounds), the design principles and a programme for the development of standard Deutsche Reichsbahn locomotive classes emerged, of which the first were built in 1925. Playing a decisive role in these discussions was the head of the Grunewald Locomotive Research Office at that time, Richard Paul Wagner. In fact the production of engines in the desired quantities could not be achieved at first, both for economic reasons and due to delays in the improvement of routes to take the higher axle loads. Of the classes with a 20-ton axle load - 01, 02, 43 and 44 - only small pre-production numbers were procured at first. Up to the end of the 1930s the state railway classes, taken over or re-ordered by the Reichsbahn, dominated the scene, in particular those of Prussian stock. The delay to the upgrade of routes also meant that additional classes with lower axle loads had to be developed, e.g. the classes 03 and 50. In spite of the Deutsche Reichsbahn's ambitious plans, their actual acquisition of locomotives, even from 1925 onwards, only reached about one tenth of the average procurement quantities for the years 1914-1920 and it remained at this level until 1938. The causes of this were the worldwide economic crises and the resulting reduction in demand for Reichsbahn's railway services. Not until 1930 was the 500th standard locomotive built (2% of the total fleet), in 1934 the 1000th engine was delivered (4% of the total) and in 1938 there were 1,500 Einheitsloks in existence (6% of the total). Not until 1939 did the procurement quantities rise significantly. With the introduction of a production programme for simpler goods train locomotive designs, that led into the construction of the war locomotives (the Kriegsloks), engines with an axle load of 15 tons were built in significant quantities. Now, however, there was a different objective: supporting the conduct of the war. So by 1945 the total number of standard and war locomotives had climbed to about 14,500 (33% of the total fleet). This state of affairs stood in stark contrast to the image promoted by the Deutsche Reichsbahn, that wanted to give the impression of a modern railway administration through its railway exhibitions, record speed runs, the introduction of the SVT network and proud photographic news reports. In fact the low level of procurement was responsible for the fact that the average age of the locomotive fleet continued to rise in the years from 1925 to 1938.  Design Principles of the Einheitslokomotiven  In many cases, rivetted plate locomotive frames were used on the older steam locomotives as a support for the running gear and engine. For reasons of stability, this frame had to be of a certain height. To meet the increasing demands in performance on the newer engines, a larger boiler was required, for which there was not enough room for the high-sided plate frame. As a result, the new Einheitslokomotiven had a lower and more solid bar frame. In addition, the higher performance demanded, required a larger boiler heating area; this was achieved by extending the boiler barrel. The use of individual components or systems such as, for example, the boiler, the carrying bogies, etc., for as many classes as possible, enabled considerable savings to be achieved in construction, in repair and in the stocks of spares parts needed. So, just externally, German Einheitsdampflokomotiven can be recognised from their bar frame, their large, long boilers and corresponding short chimneys, the standardised appearance of systems like the bogies, driver's cabs and associated tenders, as well as the typical, large Wagner smoke deflectors and, later, the smaller and more elegant Witte deflectors in front of the smokestacks. Numerous improvements and optimisations were carried out on the new designs. For example, in the boiler, the heating areas and tube cross- sections were more carefully matched to one another to make best use of heat generation. At the same time the flow of smoke gases was optimised by the superheater tube system to minimise suction draught. The low position of the blast pipe in the larger smokebox at the front of the boiler is the least visible feature of the Einheitslokomotiven.  Type Diversification  The Reichsbahn tried to have the fewest possible number of locomotive classes in operation and to make maximum use of the permitted axle loads, which were dependent on the type of track bed. The sequence of construction for the Einheitsloks was driven by operational requirements and the age of the state railway classes to be replaced.  Express and Passenger Train Locomotives  As a result, after 1925, the DRG Class 01, two-cylinder, express train locomotive emerged first, with a power of about 2,200 PS and 4-6-2 wheel arrangement. It was intended to relieve the DRG Class 17s, that consisted mainly of Prussian S 10s, Saxon XII Hs and Bavarian S 3/5s with their four- cylinder, superheated, compound configuration and 4-6-0 wheel arrangement. With a power of about 1,500 PS and top speeds of around 110 km/h, they no longer met the operating requirements. The Class 02 was an attempt to produce an Einheitslok with a 4-cylinder, superheated compound engine. The state railways had had early and positive experience with this configuration, their engines being grouped into Reichsbahn classes 17 (4-6-0, 2¬¥C h4v), 18.3, 18.4-5 (4-6-2, 2‚ÄôC1‚Äô h4v) and 19 (2-8-2, 1¬¥D1¬¥ h4v). In spite of its higher power and lower fuel consumption, however, higher maintenance costs meant that the Class 02 did not go into full production. Even the ten express train locomotives that were procured were later converted to two-cylinder engines. After 1930, it was followed by the Class 03, which was a locomotive for light express trains on routes with rails designed for lower loads (maximum axle loads of 18 tons and locomotive powers of about 2,000 PS). The first pilot tests for high speed locomotives were carried out on this engine, and demonstrated that the riding qualities of a 2-cylinder locomotive at 140 km/h were still good. The development of high speed engines continued in 1935 with the appearance of the Class 05 locomotive, which was also designed to standard locomotive principles, although only 3 examples were produced. The Class 05 was permitted to travel regularly at a top speed of 175 km/h and set the world speed record for steam engines of 200 km/h. This record was later officially beaten by the English \\"Mallard\\", a LNER Class A4 locomotive, although criticism was expressed at the time that this took place on a descent and that the locomotive did not survive the record journey without damage. Just two examples of the Class 06, a still larger locomotive with a 4-8-4 wheel arrangement and a permitted top speed of 140 km/h, were built, because this class was unconvincing in terms of its riding qualities and the boiler characteristics. In 1937 variants of classes 01 and 03 were developed with three cylinders as the Class 01.10 and Class 03.10. The third cylinder was located in the middle between the outer cylinders and its connecting rod drove the cranked first driving axle. Together with the setting of the side and centre cranks on the wheel circumference, this gave a quieter ride and the higher number of piston strokes per wheel rotation produced a higher acceleration that met the demands of express services. On delivery these engines were fitted with streamlined shells. These were later removed for maintenance reasons, initially in the area of the running gear and then completely, after the end of the war, particularly as the expected improvement in tractive effort at speeds of over 140 km/h turned out to be less than expected. For branch line operations, the 2-6-0 Class 24 passenger train locomotive was developed in 1926 with an axle load of 15 tons and 920 PS. Nicknamed Steppenpferd (prairie horse), it was aimed at duties in East Prussia. As a tender locomotive it was intended for long journeys with a top speed of 90 km/h as well as for light fast trains (Eilz√ºge). From this locomotive a tank engine variant, the 2-6-2 Class 64, was developed for shuttle services on shorter routes. The 4-6-4 Class 62 locomotive was built for short main lines with numerous turn-arounds (termini). It had a top speed of 100 km/h.  Goods Train Locomotives and Shunters  Because the improvement and replacement of the typical, former state railway, goods train locomotives such as the Prussian G 8.3 and G 8.2 would be necessary, standard goods train engines were procured too. First to appear after 1925 were the two-cylinder 2-10-0 locomotives of Class 43 and the three-cylinder Class 44s, each with a 20-ton axle load. As part of the drive towards standardisation, many components, such as the boilers, were largely identical with those of the Class 01. The Class 85 was built as a 2-10-2 tank locomotive variant in 1932. In 1928 the lighter 2-8-2 Class 86 tank engines arrived with a 15-ton axle load, as well as the 2-6-2 Class 64 tank locomotives (many parts being identical to those of the Class 24) for passenger and goods traffic on branch lines. The 2-8-2 Class 41 goods train locomotive (many of whose parts were the same as those of the Class 03) was designed for fast goods trains, e.g. for the transportation of fish and fruit. With its 1,600 mm wheel diameter it could reach a top speed of 90 km/h. That put it within the range of light express train duties, for which it was often used e.g. on the Thuringian Forest lines (e.g. to Meiningen from Arnstadt and Eisenach). Other engines built to standard designs, albeit in smaller numbers, appeared from 1936 in the shape of the heavy and especially powerful 2-10-2 Class 45 goods train locomotives. In order to raise performance and improve economy, the boiler pressure on the Class 45, and other classes, was increased to 20 bar experimentally. However the steel boiler used and the type of steel employed were not up to it, so that the pressure had to be reduced to the usual 16 bar. In many cases, the boilers were later completely replaced. For shunting duties, the 0-6-0 Class 80 and the 0-8-0 Class 81 locomotive emerged in 1926 with a power of 860 PS. The ten-coupled Class 87 engines with their two Lutterm√∂ller cogwheel axles were built for operations on the very tight curves of Hamburg Harbour's railways. The 16 locomotives of this class were however retired as early as 1954 again because they tended to overheat at higher speeds and could only be used for shunting. As a replacement the Class 82, a new locomotive with Beugniot bogies was used.  Narrow Gauge Engines  The construction principles used for standard locomotives were also used for newly built narrow gauge engines in order to reduce the cost of servicing and maintenance. Initially 32 Class 99.73-76 locomotives were built from 1928 to 1933 for the Saxony narrow gauge railways, with a rail gauge of 750 mm. In 1929 the Class 99.22 was developed for the Prussian, Bavarian, Baden and W√ºrttemberg metre gauge railways. However, only 3 examples were built, all fitted with a Class 81 boiler. In 1932 the last narrow gauge Einheitslok appeared: the Class 99.32 with a 900 mm rail gauge. Three were built for the B√§derbahn ('Spa Line'), the line from Bad Doberan to K√ºhlungsborn.

The founder and editor was WB Langbridge. Ownership of the newspaper changed many times over the next 40 years, including several times through mortgagee sales. Despite these hardships the Times issued a Christmas supplement in 1897 which featured one of the earliest use of photographs in New Zealand newspapers. From 1913 the paper's viability stabilised under the Gifford and Cross families. Both families were associated with the paper until it was sold to Wilson and Horton in 1992. Ownership changed again in 1996 when Independent Newspapers PC from Dublin acquired a controlling interest in Wilson and Horton. In 1976 a fire destroyed the newspaper's entire collection of back issues. The publisher had kept copies on microfilm, which are held by the Alexander Turnbull Library. The Times became more successful from the early 1950s, with its progress linked with the Bay of Plenty's rapid growth since Mt Maunganui became an export port. http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi- bin/paperspast?a=d&cl;=CL1.BOPT&essay;=1&e;=-------10--1----0-- However, from the early 2000s it began to face challenges of declining circulation and advertising.

McLean, a 22-year-old Canadian man, was stabbed, beheaded and cannibalized while riding a Greyhound Canada bus about west of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, travelling the Trans-Canada Highway. On March 5, 2009, McLean's killer, the 40-year-old Chinese-Canadian Vincent Weiguang Li (, commonly just called Vince Li) (born April 30, 1968) was found not to be criminally responsible for murder and was remanded to a high-security mental health facility in Selkirk, Manitoba, where he was detained until his release on May 8, 2015. Incident The incident took place near Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, during a trip from Edmonton to McLean's hometown of Winnipeg.\\"Suspect in bus killing delivered newspapers, worked at McDonald's\\", CBC.ca, August 1, 2008. Accessed August 6, 2008. At 12:01 p.m. on July 30, 2008, Tim McLean, a carnival barker, was returning home to Manitoba after working at a fair in Alberta. He departed Edmonton on board Greyhound bus 1170 to Winnipeg, via the Yellowhead Highway through Saskatchewan. He sat at the rear, one row ahead of the toilet. At 6:55 p.m., the bus departed from a stop in Erickson, Manitoba, with a new passenger, Vince Weiguang Li.Friesen, Joe. 'Please kill me,' accused begs in court, The Globe and Mail, August 6, 2008. Accessed August 6, 2008. Li, described as a tall man in his 40s, with a shaved head and sunglasses, originally sat near the front of the bus, but moved to sit next to McLean following a scheduled rest stop. McLean \\"barely acknowledged\\" Li, then fell asleep against the window pane, headphones covering his ears.Friesen, Joe. A quiet ride - then carnage, The Globe and Mail, August 1, 2008. Accessed August 6, 2008. According to witnesses, McLean was sleeping with his headphones on when the man sitting next to him suddenly produced a large knife and began stabbing McLean in the neck and chest. After the attack began, the bus driver pulled to the side of the road, and he and all the other passengers fled the vehicle. The driver and two other men made an attempt to rescue McLean, but were chased away by Li, who slashed at them from behind the locked bus doors. Li ultimately decapitated McLean and displayed his severed head to those standing outside the bus, then returned to McLean's body and began severing other parts and consuming some of McLean's flesh. At 8:30 p.m., the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Portage la Prairie received a report of a stabbing on a Greyhound bus west of the city. They arrived to find the suspect still on board the bus, being prevented from escaping by another passenger, the bus driver, and a truck driver who had provided a crowbar and a hammer as weapons. The other passengers were huddled at the roadside, some of them crying and vomiting. As the suspect had earlier attempted to escape by driving the bus away, the driver had engaged the emergency immobiliser system, rendering the vehicle inoperable. Witnesses had observed the suspect stabbing and cutting McLean's body, and carrying McLean's severed head. By 9:00 p.m., police were in a standoff with the suspect and had summoned special negotiators and a heavily armed tactical unit. The suspect alternately paced the length of the bus and defiled the corpse. Police officers then observed Li eating parts of the body. Meanwhile, the stranded passengers were transported from the scene to be interviewed at the Brandon RCMP detachment. RCMP officers reportedly heard Li say, \\"I have to stay on the bus forever.\\" On July 31, 2008, at 1:30 a.m., the suspect attempted to escape from the bus by breaking through a window. The RCMP arrested Li soon afterward.Kitching, Chris. RCMP identify man accused of beheading victim, Winnipeg Sun, August 1, 2008.

He was shot with a Taser twice, handcuffed and placed in the back of a police cruiser. Parts of the victim's body, placed in plastic bags, were retrieved from the bus, while his ear, nose and tongue were found in Li's pockets. The victim's eyes and a part of his heart were never recovered and are presumed to have been eaten by Li. At 10:00 a.m., Greyhound representatives took the other passengers to a local store to replace their clothes, which remained on the bus. They arrived in Winnipeg at 3:30 p.m. that day, to be reunited with family members and friends.

The psychiatrist Stanley Yaren, who later examined Li, said Li was hospitalized in 2003 or 2004 after an incident with the Ontario Provincial Police. He worked in Winnipeg at menial jobs at Grant Memorial Church for six months to support his wife, Anna. Pastor Tom Castor, who employed Li, said he seemed happy to have a job and was committed to doing it well, despite a language barrier with other congregation members. \\"I think he would occasionally feel frustrated with not being able to communicate or understand,\\" Castor told CTV Winnipeg. \\"But we have very patient staff members and he seemed to respond well.\\" Castor also said Li did not show any signs of anger issues or any other trouble before he quit in the spring of 2005. He worked as a forklift operator in Winnipeg while his wife worked as a waitress. Li first moved to Edmonton in 2006, abruptly leaving his wife alone in Winnipeg until she joined him later.Steve Lillebuen, Jennifer Yang. Alleged beheader lost Wal-Mart job over conflict with fellow worker , Calgary Herald, August 4, 2008. Accessed August 6, 2008. His jobs included service at a Wal-Mart, at a fast-food restaurant, and newspaper delivery. His delivery boss, Vincent Augert, described Li as reliable, hard-working and not showing any signs of trouble. Four weeks before the killing, he was fired from Wal-Mart following a \\"disagreement\\" with other employees. Shortly before the incident, Li asked for time off from his delivery job to go to Winnipeg for a job interview. July 29, 2008 At 12:05 p.m. July 28 in Edmonton, Li boarded a Greyhound bus bound for Winnipeg. On July 29, around 6 p.m., Li got off the bus in Erickson, Manitoba, with at least three pieces of luggage, and stayed the night on a bench next to a grocery store. According to one witness, he was seen at 3 a.m. sitting bolt upright with eyes wide open. On the morning of July 30, still at the bench, he sold his new laptop computer to a 15-year- old boy for $60. The laptop was seized by the RCMP as evidence; the boy was subsequently given a new laptop for his honesty by an anonymous businessman. Witness Garnet Caton said the attacker seemed oblivious to others when the stabbing occurred, adding he was struck by Li's calm demeanor. \\"There was no rage or anything. He was like a robot, stabbing the guy,\\" he said. When he appeared in a Portage la Prairie courthouse on charges of second-degree murder, the only words Li reportedly uttered were pleas for someone to kill him. Trial Li's trial commenced on March 3, 2009, with Li pleading not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder (NCRMD) ( insanity defense). This means he accepted that the offence occurred but claimed that he was unable to form the necessary mental element or mens rea. The psychiatrist said that Li performed the attack because God's voice told him McLean was a force of evil and was about to execute him. The presiding judge, John Scurfield, accepted the diagnosis, and ruled that Li was not criminally responsible for the killing. Li was remanded to the Selkirk Mental Health Centre. Aftermath The week following the attack, Greyhound Canada announced it was pulling a series of nationwide advertisements which included the slogan, \\"There's a reason you've never heard of bus rage.\\" The incident has led to numerous calls and petitions demanding increased security on intercity buses.Rynor, Becky. Greyhound pulls 'bus rage' ads , The Windsor Star, August 5, 2008. Retrieved August 5, 2008. After the incident, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) attempted to run an ad in the Portage Daily Graphic comparing the killing of McLean to the consumption of animals. The paper's publisher refused to run the ad.CBC. , August 6, 2008. Accessed November 22, 2014. The family of Tim McLean have brought a lawsuit of $150,000 against Greyhound, the Attorney General of Canada, and Vince Li. On June 3, 2010, Li was granted supervised outdoor walks within his mental health facility as voted by the provincial review board. On February 16, 2011, two passengers, Debra Tucker, of Port Colborne, Ontario and Kayli Shaw, of London, Ontario filed a lawsuit against Li, Greyhound, the RCMP, and the Government of Canada for being exposed to the beheading. They were each seeking $3 million in damages.Winnipeg Free Press. On July 14, 2015, the two women dropped their lawsuit.Global News. On May 30, 2011, the CBC reported that Li was responding well to his psychiatric treatment and that his doctor had recommended that he receive more freedoms, phased in over several months. On May 17, 2012, the National Post reported that Li had been granted temporary passes that would allow him out of the Selkirk Mental Health Centre for visits to the town of Selkirk, supervised by a nurse and peace officer. In an interview, Li spoke for the first time, saying that he began hearing \\"the voice of God\\" in 2004 and that he wanted to save the people from an alien attack.Canada cannibal says he believed victim was an alien, The Daily Telegraph, May 23, 2012 On February 27, 2014, the CBC reported that on March 6, Li would be allowed to have unsupervised visits to Selkirk, starting at 30 minutes and expanding to full-day trips. Since 2013, he had been allowed to have supervised visits to Lockport, Winnipeg, and nearby beaches. Those visits were then relaxed. On July 17, 2014, the Toronto Sun reported that one of the first officers on the scene, Corporal Ken Barker of the RCMP, had committed suicide.Cop at scene of 2008 Manitoba bus beheading commits suicide , The Toronto Sun, July 17, 2014 The family stated in his obituary that he was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder.Ken Barker Obituary, Winnipeg Free Press, July 16, 2014 On February 27, 2015, CBC News reported that Li was given unsupervised day passes to visit Winnipeg so long as he carried a functioning cellular telephone while using them. On May 8, 2015, CTV News reported that Li would be granted passes to group homes in the community. In February 2016, it was reported that Li had legally changed his name and was seeking to leave his group home to live independently. He won the right to live alone on February 26 upon the recommendation of the Criminal Code Review Board. On February 10, 2017, the Manitoba Criminal Code Review Board ordered Li be discharged. Li was granted an absolute discharge. There will be no legal obligations or restrictions pertaining to Li's independent living.

East Mountain Teaching () denotes the teachings of the Fourth Ancestor Dayi Daoxin, his student and heir the Fifth Ancestor Daman Hongren, and their students and lineage of Chan Buddhism. East Mountain Teaching gets its name from the East Mountain Temple on the \\"Twin Peaks\\" () of Huangmei (modern Hubei). The East Mountain Temple was on the easternmost peak of the two. Its modern name is Wuzu Temple (). The two most famous disciples of Hongren, Huineng and Yuquan Shenxiu, both continued the East Mountain teaching. History The East Mountain School was established by Daoxin ( 580‚Äì651) at East Mountain Temple on Potou (Broken Head) Mountain, which was later renamed Shuangfeng (Twin Peaks). Daoxin taught there for 30 years. He established the first monastic home for \\"Bodhidharma's Zen\\". The tradition holds that Hongren ( 601‚Äì674) left home at an early age (between seven and fourteen) and lived at East Mountain Temple on Twin Peaks, where Daoxin was the abbot. Teachings The East Mountain community was a specialized meditation training centre. The establishment of a community in one location was a change from the wandering lives of Bodhidharma and Huike and their followers. It fit better into Chinese society, which highly valued community-oriented behaviour over solitary practice. An important aspect of the East Mountain Teachings was its nonreliance on a single sutra or a single set of sutras for its doctrinal foundation as was done by most of the other Buddhist sects of the time. The East Mountain School incorporated both the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra and the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutras. The view of the mind in the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana also had a significant import on the doctrinal development of the East Mountain Teaching:Zeuschner, Robert B. (1978). \\"The Understanding of Mind in the Northern Line of Ch'an (Zen).\\" Philosophy East and West, Volume 28, Number 1 (January 1978). Hawaii, USA: University of Hawaii Press, pp. 69-79 Meditation There were three main meditation techniques taught by this school. One was a meditation on ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ \\"emptiness\\" in which one contemplates all dharmas of body and mind as empty. Another practice was the contemplation of some 'ultimate principle', this was associated with the 'one-practice samadhi' () and in some texts such as the Lengqie shizi ji is achieved by meditating on a single Buddha. The third technique was the practice of concentrating the mind on one thing (guan yi wu) until the mind becomes fixed in samadhi. The goal of all of these practices was to suppress the stream of thoughts which clouds the mind and allow the practitioner to gain insight into the pure, radiant consciousness in everyone. = Maintaining the One= According to John R. McRae the \\"first explicit statement of the sudden and direct approach that was to become the hallmark of Ch'an religious practice\\" first appears in a Chinese text named the Ju-tao an-hsin yao-fang-pien fa-men (JTFM, Instructions on essential expedients for calming the mind and accessing the path), itself a part of the Leng Ch'ieh Shih TZu Chi (Records of the Masters of the Lankavatara).McRae, John R. (1986). The Northern School and the Formation of Early Ch ªan Buddhism, University of Hawaii Press, p. 143. The Records of the Masters of the Lankavatara is associated with the early Chan tradition known as the \\"East Mountain School\\" and has been dated to around 713.Robert E. Buswell Jr. (2017). The Formation of Ch'an Ideology in China and Korea: The Vajrasamadhi-Sutra, a Buddhist Apocryphon. Princeton University Press, p. 141. This method is named \\"Maintaining the one without wavering\\" (shou-i pu i, ÂÆà‰∏Ä‰∏çÁßª). According to McRae: > ...the practical explanation of \\"maintaining the One without wavering\\" is > that one is simply to contemplate every aspect of one's mental and physical > existence, focusing on each individual component with unswerving attention > until one realizes its essential emptiness or non-substantiality. The > interesting aspect of this regimen is, paradoxically, its apparent > conventionality. Although further examination will reveal significant > differences between this and traditional Buddhist meditation practice, the > description given so far would apply equally well to the most basic of > Mahayana techniques: the insight-oriented contemplation of the non- > substantiality of the body. Although this type of contemplation is the > common property of virtually all schools of Mahayana Buddhism, its > presentation here differs in at least two ways from that found in more > traditional texts. First, no preparatory requirements, no moral > prerequisites or preliminary exercises are given. Instead, one moves > directly into the practice of contemplation. Second, the technique of > \\"maintaining the One without wavering\\" is in itself completely without steps > or gradations. One concentrates, understands, and is enlightened, all in one > undifferentiated practice. McRae further notes that > the JTFM makes allowance for both sudden apperception of the Buddha Nature > and gradual improvement in the brightness and purity of the concentrated > mind...the JTFM actually allows for a number of alternative situations: One > may achieve \\"bright purity\\" of mind either with or without undertaking the > extended practice of \\"viewing the mind.\\" One may also achieve enlightenment > either solely through one's own efforts or, conversely, with the aid of a > teacher's instruction. The point of these alternatives is that a true > teacher must be able to understand which students are best suited for which > approach and to teach them differently on the basis of that > understanding.McRae, John R. (1986). The Northern School and the Formation > of Early Ch ªan Buddhism, University of Hawaii Press, p. 144. Fourth Patriarch Daoxin (ÂõõÁ•ñÈÅì‰ø°) Daoxin is credited with several important innovations that led directly to the ability of Chan to become a popular religion. Among his most important contributions were: # The Unification of Chan practice with acceptance of the Buddhist precepts, # The unification of the teachings of the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra with those of the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutras, which includes the well-known Heart Sutra and Diamond Sutra, # The incorporation of chanting, including chanting the name of Buddha, into Chan practice. Fifth Patriarch Hongren (‰∫îÁ•ñÂºòÂøç) Hongren was a plain meditation teacher, who taught students of \\"various religious interests\\", including \\"practitioners of the Lotus Sutra, students of Madhyamaka philosophy, or specialists in the monastic regulations of Buddhist Vinaya\\". Following Daoxin, Hongren included an emphasis on the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutras, including the Heart Sutra and the Diamond Sutra, along with the emphasis on the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra. Though Hongren was known for not compiling writings and for teaching Zen principles orally, the classical Chan text Discourse on the Highest Vehicle, is attributed to him. This work emphasizes the practice of \\"maintaining the original true mind\\" that \\"naturally cuts off the arising of delusion.\\" Split in Northern and Southern School Originally Shenxiu was considered to be the \\"Sixth Patriarch\\", carrying the mantle of Bodhidharma's Zen through the East Mountain School. After the death of Shenxiu, his student Shenhui started a campaign to establish Huineng as the Sixth Ancestor. Eventually Shenhui's position won the day, and Huineng was recognized as the Sixth Patriarch. The successful promulgation of Shenhui's views led to Shenxiu's branch being widely referred to by others as the \\"Northern School.\\" This nomenclature has continued in western scholarship, which for the most part has largely viewed Chinese Zen through the lens of southern Chan. Northern and Southern School (ÂçóÈ†ìÂåóÊº∏) The terms Northern and Southern have little to do with geography: The basic difference is between approaches. Shenhui characterised the Northern School as employing gradual teachings, while his Southern school employed sudden teachings: The term \\"East Mountain Teaching\\" is seen as more culturally and historically appropriate.Ray, Gary L.(2005). The Northern Ch'an School and Sudden Versus Gradual Enlightenment Debates in China and Tibet. Source: (accessed: December 2, 2007) But the characterization of Shenxiu's East Mountain Teaching as gradualist is argued to be unfounded in light of the documents found amongst Dunhuang manuscripts recovered from the Mogao Caves near Dunhuang. Shenhui's Southern School incorporated Northern teachings as well, and Shenhui himself admittedly saw the need of further practice after initial awakening. Shenxiu (Á•ûÁßÄ, 606?-706 CE) Yuquan Shenxiu's prominent position in the history of Ch√°n, despite the popular narrative, is recognized by modern scholarship: Kuiken (undated: p. 17) in discussing a Dunhuang document of the Tang monk and meditator, 'Jingjue' (ÈùúË¶∫, 683- ca. 750) states: > Jingjue's Record introduces Hongren of Huangmei ÈªÉÊ¢ÖÂÆèÂøç (d.u.) as the main > teacher in the sixth generation of the 'southern' or 'East Mountain' > meditation tradition. Shenxiu is mentioned as Hongren's authorized > successor. In Shenxiu's shadow, Jingjue mentions 'old An' ËÄÅÂÆâ (see A) as a > 'seasoned' meditation teacher and some minor 'local disciples' of > Hongren.Kuiken, Kees (undated). The Other Neng 2: Part Two Sources and > Resources. Source: (accessed: August 6, 2008) p.17 Shenxiu wrote a treatise on meditation called the Kuan-hsin lun (\\"treatise on contemplating the mind\\"). It combines some of the meditation practices taught by Zhiyi with ideas from the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana.Gregory, Peter N; Traditions of Meditation in Chinese Buddhism, 106. Hui-neng (ÂÖ≠Á•ñÊÉ†ËÉΩ or ÊÖßËÉΩÂ§ßÂ∏´) The story of Huineng is famously worded in the Platform Sutra, a text which originated after Shenhui's death. Its core may have originated within the so-called Oxhead school. The text was subsequently edited and enlarged, and reflects various Ch√°n teachings. It de-emphasizes the difference between the Northern and the Southern School. The first chapter of the Platform Sutra relates the story of Huineng and his inheritance of the East Mountain Teachings.

(2 vol. set; paper) p.108 Originally Faru too was credited to be the successor of Hongren. But Faru did not have a good publicist, and he was not included within the list of Chan Patriarchs. Because of Faru, the 'Shaolin Monastery', constructed in 496CE, yet again became prominent. [Faru] had only a brief stay at Shaolin Temple, but during his stay the cloister became the epicentre of the flourishing Chan movement. An epitaph commemorating the success of Faru's pioneering endeavors is located on Mount Sung. Baotang Wuzhu Baotang Wuzhu (, 714-774), founder and abbot of Baotang Monastery () in Chengdu in Southwest China was a member of the East Mountain Teachings. Moheyan (late eighth century CE, Â§ß‰πòÂíåÂ∞ö or Êë©Ë®∂Ë°ç) Moheyan (late eighth century CE) was a proponent of the Northern School. Moheyan traveled to Dunhuang, which at the time belonged to the Ancient Tibetan Empire, in 781 or 787 CE.Ray, Gary L.(2005). The Northern Ch'an School and Sudden Versus Gradual Enlightenment Debates in China and Tibet Moheyan participated in a prolonged debate with Kamalashila at Samye in Tibet over sudden versus gradual teachings, which was decisive for the course the Tibetan Buddhist tradition took: Broughton identifies the Chinese and Tibetan nomenclature of Mohoyen's teachings and identifies them principally with the East Mountain Teachings: The teachings of Moheyan and other Chan masters were unified with the Kham Dzogchen lineages {this may or may not be congruent with the Kahma (Tibetan: bka' ma) lineages} through the Kunkhyen (Tibetan for \\"omniscient\\"), Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo.Barber, A.

Background In March 1882, on the eve of Commandant Henri Rivi√®re's seizure of the citadel of Hanoi, France had two naval divisions in the Far East. The seas to the east of the Hainan Strait were the responsibility of Rear Admiral Charles Meyer's Far East naval division (division navale de l'Extr√™me-Orient). France's interests in Indochina were protected by Rivi√®re's Cochinchina naval division (division navale de Cochinchine), responsible for monitoring coastal navigation between Singapore and the Hainan Strait and along the rivers of Cochinchina and Cambodia.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 140 Several vessels under Rivi√®re's command were normally stationed in Cochinchina or Cambodia, including the troopship Drac, the light frigate Alouette and the small gunboats Fram√©e and Javeline. Tilsitt, the flagship of the Cochinchina naval division, was disarmed and in permanent dock at Saigon, and served as the division's storehouse and administrative centre. Most of the division's vessels, however, were stationed in Tonkin, where they were enforcing the right of free navigation on the Red River conceded to France by the Vietnamese government in 1874. Rivi√®re's command in Tonkin consisted of the light frigates Hamelin, Parseval and Antilope (the latter due to be replaced shortly by Pluvier), the heavy gunboats Lynx and Vip√®re, the seagoing gunboats Fanfare, L√©opard and Surprise, and the smaller river gunboats Carabine, √âclair, Hache, Massue, Trombe and Yatagan. The heavy gunboats had crews of 77 men and mounted four cannon, while the smaller gunboats had two cannon each. They all carried a Hotchkiss canon- revolver in their tops.Huard, 4‚Äì6; Loir, 6; Marolles, 60‚Äì61; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 140 Following Rivi√®re's defeat and death at the Battle of Paper Bridge (19 June 1883), the navy ministry created a new Tonkin Coasts naval division (division navale des c√¥tes du Tonkin) under the command of Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet, whose mission was to cut off the flow of weapons and ammunition from China to the Black Flag Army by blockading the Gulf of Tonkin. The larger seagoing vessels already on station in Tonkin were transferred to Courbet's new naval division, while the remainder (mostly gunboats) were organised into the 'Tonkin Flotilla'. The flotilla was initially placed under the command of g√©n√©ral de brigade Alexandre-Eug√®ne Bou√´t (1833‚Äì87), the French commandant sup√©rieur in Tonkin. Operational command was given to capitaine de vaisseau Morel-Beaulieu.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 160 Composition The Tonkin Flotilla consisted initially of the light frigates (avisos √† roues) Pluvier and Alouette, the seagoing gunboats Fanfare, L√©opard and Surprise, the large river gunboats (avisos de flotille √† roues) √âclair and Trombe, and the smaller river gunboats (chaloupes-cannoni√®res d√©montables) Carabine, Hache, Massue and Yatagan. Alouette was normally stationed in Cochinchina, and does not seem to have seen service in Tonkin.Cahu, 3; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 160 The stationary pontoon Tilsitt at Saigon and the small river gunboats Fram√©e, Javeline and Mousqueton, normally stationed in Cochinchina, were also placed under the orders of the commander of the Tonkin Flotilla.Cahu, 3 In April 1884 the Farcy gunboats Revolver and Mitrailleuse, both of which had seen service on the Seine during the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì1), arrived in Tonkin. The two gunboats were transported to Tonkin lashed to the bridge of the troopship Bien Hoa, and re-floating them on their arrival at Haiphong was a technical task of considerable complexity.Rollet de l'Isle, 92‚Äì4 In October 1883 Admiral Courbet asked the navy ministry to design a new class of shallow-draft gunboats which could penetrate the maze of shallow tributary streams and arroyos of the Delta, so that the Black Flags and pirates could be hunted down far more effectively. The ministry accepted his recommendations, and laid down two new classes of gunboats. Eight gunboats of the Henri Rivi√®re class were designed and built specifically for service in Tonkin, while more than a dozen gunboats of the Arquebuse class were produced for use in both Tonkin and Madagascar. The gunboats of the former class were named after the French officers who had been killed or mortally wounded in action in Tonkin in Francis Garnier and Henri Rivi√®re's campaigns: Francis Garnier, Colonel Carreau, Henri Rivi√®re, Berthe de Villers, Jacquin and Moulun. The gunboats, built at the Clapar√®de works in Lorient, reached Haiphong in the autumn of 1884. The Arquebuse class of gunboats was designed for more general service, in Madagascar as well as Tonkin. Six vessels in this class (Arquebuse, Alerte, Avalanche, Bourrasque, Mutine and Rafale) were deployed in Tonkin in the summer of 1884. These gunboats were 30 metres long and 5 metres wide, cruised at , and drew less than one-and-a-half metres of water. Although they could carry only 60 men, they were armed with two 90-millimetre cannon and three Hotchkiss canons- revolvers, so that they packed a powerful punch. Two other gunboats of the Arquebuse class, Casse-t√™te and Estoc, joined the Tonkin flotilla in early 1885. They differed from the earlier models in having two masts, each with a Hotchkiss station. In February 1885, on the eve of the Lang Son Campaign, the Flotilla also included the gunboats Hy√®ne, Jaguar, Nagotna and Petit Haiphong. The Flotilla also deployed a number of steam launches and tugs that were used to tow strings of junks loaded with men, ammunition or food. Contemporary French sources mention the vessels Haiphong, P√©lican, Kowloon, Whampoo, Ruri Maru, Cua Cam, Cua Lac, Cua Dai, Phu Ly and Tra Ly. Just as French transports were often named after French rivers, these small river craft for use in Tonkin tended to be named after the watercourses of the Tonkin Delta. By 1886 the Flotilla included the gunboats Levrard, Bossant and Cuvellier, named after three French officers killed in action in Tonkin during the Sino-French War.Lecomte, Vie militaire, page number to be supplied Operations Pluvier engages the Vietnamese defences at Nam ƒê·ªãnh with her masthead-mounted canon- revolver, 26 March 1883 Besides policing the inland waterways of Tonkin, the vessels of the Tonkin Flotilla were also used in close support of the movements of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, and took part in several actions in the Delta against the Black Flag Army and the Chinese Guangxi and Yunnan Armies. The gunboats Carabine, Fanfare, Hache, Pluvier, Surprise and Yatagan took part in Henri Rivi√®re's Nam ƒê·ªãnh expedition in March 1883 and supported the French infantry attack on the Nam ƒê·ªãnh defences on 27 March with a preliminary bombardment on 26 March.Duboc, 97‚Äì112; Huard, 19‚Äì26; Marolles, 178‚Äì92; Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 53‚Äì4 The gunboat Song Cau (or Song Coi) took part in a sortie by the French garrison of Nam ƒê·ªãnh in July 1883 that inflicted a serious defeat on besieging Vietnamese forces under the command of Prince Ho√†ng K·∫ø Vi√™m.Duboc, 156‚Äì7; Huard, 88‚Äì92 The gunboats Pluvier, L√©opard, Fanfare, √âclair, Mousqueton and Trombe took part in the Battle of Ph·ªß Ho√†i (15 August 1883).Duboc, 162‚Äì78; Huard, 99‚Äì103; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 163‚Äì5; Histoire militaire, 60‚Äì2 The gunboats Pluvier, L√©opard, Fanfare, √âclair, Hache and Mousqueton took part in the Battle of Palan (1 September 1883).Duboc, 180‚Äì91; Huard, 131‚Äì5; Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 64‚Äì6 The gunboats Pluvier, Trombe, √âclair, Hache, Mousqueton and Yatagan took part in the S∆°n T√¢y Campaign (December 1883).  Kep Campaign, October 1884  The Tonkin Flotilla played a decisive strategic role in General Fran√ßois de N√©grier's Kep Campaign (October 1884), in which the French defeated a major Chinese invasion of the Tonkin Delta. In late September 1884 large detachments of the Guangxi Army advanced from L·∫°ng S∆°n and probed into the Luc Nam valley. On 2 October the French gunboats Hache and Massue, on patrol in the Luc Nam river, were ambushed from the riverbank by a strong force of Chinese infantry. A third gunboat, Mousqueton, came to the rescue, and the three French vessels escaped downriver to the French post at Sept Pagodes. Although the French suffered heavy casualties in this ambush (lieutenant de vaisseau Challier of Massue was killed and 32 sailors and soldiers were wounded), the Guangxi Army had disclosed its presence prematurely.Lecomte, Lang-Son, 44‚Äì53 Back in Hanoi, General Louis Bri√®re de l'Isle reacted swiftly to the Chinese threat. The French used the mobility conferred by their gunboats to move men and supplies between Phu Lang Thuong and the Luc Nam, enabling de N√©grier to concentrate his forces rapidly and defeat the two widely separated wings of the Chinese Guangxi Army one after the other. Hache, √âclair and Massue, accompanied by the tugs Ph·ªß L√Ω and Tra Ly and the barge Cua Dai, landed Donnier's column at Lam on 6 October, threatening the Chinese army's left wing at Chu while de N√©grier concentrated against the Chinese forces at K√©p.Huard, 439‚Äì42; Lecomte, Lang- Son, 53‚Äì66 and 103  Resupply of Tuy√™n Quang, October‚ÄìNovember 1884  Revolver runs the gauntlet of the Chinese defences at Yu Oc, October 1884 Prefect of Phu-doan, 1884 During October and November 1884 the Farcy gunboats Revolver and Mitrailleuse, based at Tuy√™n Quang, and the gunboats Bourrasque, √âclair, Mutine and Trombe, operating out of H∆∞ng H√≥a, mounted a number of dangerous supply runs along the Clear River between H∆∞ng H√≥a and Tuy√™n Quang in support of the small French garrison at Tuy√™n Quang. The supply runs were successful, but the French suffered a constant dribble of casualties as their gunboats were engaged by the Black Flags. On one occasion Revolver had to steam at full speed to break a barrage laid across the Clear River, and on another occasion her crew sustained casualties of 2 men dead and 3 wounded (including the commander, enseigne de vaisseau de Balincourt) from enemy fire from Yu Oc. In an engagement on 12 November 1884 Trombe suffered casualties of 1 man dead and 7 wounded. Revolver was eventually withdrawn from Tuy√™n Quang, but Mitrailleuse remained on station, and later distinguished herself in the Siege of Tuy√™n Quang (24 November 1884 ‚Äì 3 March 1885).  Relief of Tuy√™n Quang, February‚ÄìMarch 1885  The Tonkin Flotilla played an important role in the relief of Tuy√™n Quang. In late February 1885 the gunboats Henri Rivi√®re, Berthe de Villers, Moulun, √âclair and Trombe transported 2,400 soldiers of Lieutenant-Colonel Laurent Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade from Hanoi up the Red and Clear Rivers and put them ashore near the French post of Phu Doan on the Clear River, fifty kilometres southwest of Tuy√™n Quang. Giovanninelli had hoped to have their support when he attacked an important Chinese blocking position at H√≤a M·ªôc, but the water level in the Clear River was so low that the gunboats grounded several kilometres above Phu Doan. Their crews endured a week of back-breaking labour, hauling the gunboats along an almost-dry river bed, but despite their utmost efforts the gunboats were absent from the Battle of H√≤a M·ªôc on 2 March. Some of the French crewmen were said to have wept with rage at their inability to take part in the crucial battle for Tuy√™n Quang. The gunboats finally reached Tuy√™n Quang on 4 March, the day after the post was relieved.Huguet, 89‚Äì93; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 324‚Äì9; Vie militaire, 215‚Äì31; Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 247‚Äì8; Histoire militaire, 107‚Äì8 General Bri√®re de l'Isle was careful to acknowledge the heroic efforts made by their captains and crews in an order of the day issued on 5 March. After praising the courage of the marine infantry and Turcos of the 1st Brigade, who suffered more than 400 casualties storming the Chinese defences at H√≤a M·ªôc, he praised the sacrifices made by the men of the Flotilla: > Vous avez √©t√© plus heureux que les √©tats-majors et les √©quipages des > canonni√®res Henri Rivi√®re, Berthe de Villers, Moulun, √âclair et Trombe, qui > ont esp√©r√© jusqu‚Äôau dernier moment partager vos dangers.

He was the successor of Tantamani, the last ruler of the 25th Dynasty of Egypt, and possibly a son of Taharqa or less likely of Tantamani, while his mother was a queen whose name is only partially preserved. Atlanersa's reign immediately followed the collapse of Nubian control over Egypt, which witnessed the Assyrian conquest of Egypt and then the beginning of the Late Period under Psamtik I. The same period also saw the progressive cultural integration of Egyptian beliefs by the Kushite civilization. Atlanersa may have fathered his successor Senkamanisken with his consort Malotaral, although Senkamanisken could also be his brother. He built a pyramid in the necropolis of Nuri, now conjecturally believed to be Nuri 20 and may also have started a funerary chapel in the same necropolis, now called Nuri 500\\\\. Atlanersa was the second Nubian king to build a pyramid in Nuri after Taharqa. The pyramid produced many small artefacts which are now on display in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, US. Atlanersa's most-prominent construction is his temple to the syncretic god Osiris-Dedwen in Jebel Barkal called B700, which he finished and had time to only partially decorate. This suggests that he died unexpectedly. The temple entrance was to be flanked with two colossal statues of the king, one of which was completed and set in place and is now in the National Museum of Sudan. Royal family=Parents Atlanersa was the son of king Taharqa or less probably of Atlanersa's immediate predecessor Tantamani. Specialists, such as L√°szl√≥ T√∂r√∂k, who contend that Atlanersa's father was Taharqa, explain the intervening reign of Tantamani by positing that Atlanersa might have been too young to ascend the throne at the death of his father and that attempting a military reconquest of Egypt required a strong king. A cultural explanation is also possible: Napatan society might have recognized seniority and maturity as valid arguments for inheriting a throne. In this sense a young heir to the throne would be overlooked in favor of someone older until they reached maturity. At this point, should the king die, the right to the throne of the original heir would be reinstated. If Atlanersa was indeed a son of Taharqa, then he was a cross-cousin of Tantamani. Atlanersa's mother was a queen who appeared on a pylon scene at Jebel Barkal Temple B700 but whose name is not fully preserved and is only known to have ended in [...]salka. She bore the title of \\"Great one of the Imat-scepter, noblewoman\\". Consorts and children Atlanersa was married to at least two of his sisters: Yeturow, who bore the title of \\"wife of the king, daughter of the king, sister of the king, mistress of Egypt\\", and Khaliset (also known as Khalese) who was \\"noblewoman, lady of the Imat-sceptre, singer, great daughter of the king\\". Khaliset was intended to be the mother of Atlanersa's heir, as indicated by her titles, but it may have been another of Atlanersa's consorts, Malotaral \\"mistress of Kush\\", who was the mother of Atlanersa's heir Senkamanisken. Further potential consorts of Atlanersa have been identified: his sister Peltasen and queens K[...] and Taba[...]. Finally, there is a distinct possibility that Amenirdis II, the Divine Adoratrice of Amun in Thebes, was married to Atlanersa. In addition, she may have been his sister. One daughter of Atlanersa by one of his wives is known: Queen Nasalsa, sister-wife of Senkamanisken and mother of Anlamani and Aspelta. It is also possible that Queen Amanimalel was his daughter. Atlanersa's successor Senkamanisken may have been his son, but could instead have been his brother. Attestations and activities=Temple B700 Barque stand from Temple B700 showing Atlanersa holding up the heavens, now in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston Foundation tablets bearing Atlanersa's name show that he started a temple dedicated to the syncretic god Osiris-Dedwen at Jebel Barkal, now known as B700. The choice for this location followed from its closeness to the \\"Pure Mountain\\"‚Äîthe ancient name of Jebel Barkal‚Äîand the presence of a small New Kingdom chapel there. It is unclear whether Atlanersa ordered the destruction of this chapel to make place for B700, or whether the chapel was already ruined by this time. The temple, now ruined, was entered through a pylon and comprised a small court followed by an inner sanctuary. The court and sanctuary both had four columns, with palm capitals and papyrus flower bundle capitals, respectively. The inner sanctuary was inscribed with a lengthy hymn to Osiris, possibly indirectly referring to the deceased Taharqa. The walls were further decorated with reliefs depicting the activities performed during the coronation of the king, almost all of which have now disappeared. Beneath two of the corners of the inner room were two foundation deposits buried at the start of the temple construction, notably with the tablets showing Atlanersa's name. A stand for a sacred barque stood at the centre of the sanctuary. The stand is made of a single block of granite weighing over . The purpose of the stand was to support the barque of the god Amun of Napata when it visited the temple from the nearby Temple B500. Boat stand of Atlanersa in situ in Temple B700 in 1916 Atlanersa's name was present on a scene inscribed on the front pylon of the temple, now destroyed. The decoration of the pylon was predominantly made during Senkamanisken's reign, yet it depicted queens Yeturow, K[...] and Khaliset, who are implied to be both Atlanersa's wives as well as his sisters. Finally, Atlanersa's name is written on a granite altar from the same temple. The progression of the temple construction suggests that Atlanersa died unexpectedly, shortly after completing the construction works and the decoration of the two interior rooms‚Äîas attested by the presence of his name there‚Äîbut before completing the decoration of the exterior. This task was finished under Senkamanisken who added inscriptions of his own on the columns and front pylon, and donated a small obelisk. A colossal statue of Atlanersa was placed on the western side of the temple entrance, where it was discovered by Reisner, albeit toppled with its head cut-off. It is now in the National Museum of Sudan. Reliefs on the barque stand and on the sanctuary walls show Atlanersa holding up the heavens and performing the ceremony of uniting the two lands, originally solely a part of the coronation of Egyptian pharaohs but subsequently an integral part of the Kushite royal legitimation. Thus, Atlanersa ruled at a pivotal time which saw the cultural integration of Egyptian concepts and institutional continuity between the 25th Dynasty state and the subsequent Napatan kingdom of Kush. This further indicates that, originally, the temple's importance lay in its role during the accession of a king to the throne: following the death of his predecessor, the king went to the temple \\"in order to be confirmed in his new role by Amun and giving the office of kingship renewed life\\". After Senkamanisken's rule, the temple might have served as a mortuary temple for Atlanersa and, even later, for all deceased Kushite kings. Tombos, in all probability representing Atlanersa Temple B500 Contrary to his predecessors and successors, Atlanersa is the only Kushite king of the mid-7th century BC whose statue was absent from the statue cache uncovered in Jebel Barkal Temple B500 by George Andrew Reisner in 1916. Statues of Tantamani, Senkamanisken, Anlamani and Aspelta were uncovered there. Old Dongola, Tombos and Thebes A scarab seal of Atlanersa, now in the Louvre Museum, may originate from Thebes. At Old Dongola, a fragmentary obelisk bearing Atlanersa's name was discovered in a church, where it had been reused as a column. In a quarry near Tombos, a statue of the same size and shape and made of the same stone as the statue of Atlanersa from B700 was uncovered unfinished, almost certainly left there because it had cracked. The statue was likely destined to be the eastern pendant of the colossal statue at the west of the entrance of B700 and therefore represents Atlanersa. Tomb Ruins of pyramid Nuri 20 of Atlanersa (center) next to standing pyramid Nuri 2 of Amaniastabarqa. Closeup of the ruins of Nuri pyramid 20 of Atlanersa (foreground) and the pyramid of Amaniastabarqa (background) Following excavations at the necropolis of Nuri, Reisner proposed to attribute the pyramid Nuri 20 to Atlanersa on chronological grounds. Nuri 20 is the second- oldest pyramid of the necropolis after that of Taharqa and did not belong to Senkamanisken, whose pyramid Nuri 3 was built subsequently. Reisner's arguments have been broadly accepted. Atlanersa was the second king, following Taharqa, to choose Nuri for burial; this fact motivates certain specialists‚Äîincluding T√∂r√∂k, Timothy Kendall and El-Hassan Ahmed Mohamed‚Äîto posit that Atlanersa was Taharqa's son, and that he chose this necropolis to be close to and honor his father. The pyramid is made of sandstone masonry, with a steep slope at 66¬∞ and a surface area of c. . The pyramid complex is surrounded by a sandstone enclosure and comprises a small chapel adjacent to the pyramid eastern side. At its center, the chapel housed an offering stand on which was an offering table, both of grey granite. The table was originally inscribed with reliefs and hieroglyphs, now illegible. The pyramid substructures were accessed from a stair of 36 steps, starting at ground level east of the chapel. At the end of the staircase was a wall of masonry meant to bar thieves from entering the tomb, which comprised two chambers. The antechamber is in size, while the burial chamber is larger at . The latter contained a lid and several fragments of canopic jars, 11 or 12 canopic clay figures of gods and goddesses including Osiris, Imsety and Neith, a few inlay pieces of lapis lazuli, obsidian and slate (all originally from a sarcophagus), and fragmentary faience shawabtis. Excavations of the pyramid yielded numerous objects including fragments of jars and alabaster vessels, one of which was inscribed with Tantamani's cartouches, several bowls, a beryl scarab attached to a gold wire loop, pieces of gold foil, a faience pendant with Atlanersa's cartouche, Menat amulets and beads, pieces of paste, and further fragments of shawabtis. In total, 15 complete shawabtis were recovered of over 235 found in the pyramid, all c. in size. Many of these objects are now on display at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. A nearby rectangular building of brown sandstone, now known as Nuri 500, may have been a funerary chapel. It yielded an alabaster votive tablet bearing Atlanersa's cartouche. Political situation=Chronology Atlanersa holding up the heavens, on a stand for a boat shrine of Amun-Re Atlanersa might have been born around 671 BC or shortly after, when Taharqa's heir apparent Nes-Anhuret was captured in Memphis by Esarhaddon. Atlanersa reigned for a decade in the mid-7th century BC, ascending to the throne around 653 BC and dying around 643 BC, a period of Nubian history now called the early Napatan period. This makes him a contemporary of Ashurbanipal (fl. c. 668‚Äì627 BC) and Psamtik I (fl. c. 664‚Äì610 BC). Collapse of the 25th Dynasty By the end of Taharqa's reign, the 25th Dynasty state was in crisis, on the losing side of a war against the Neo- Assyrian Empire. From c. 665‚Äì664 BC, Taharqa and Tantamani had lost control of Lower Egypt, which came under the power of Assyrian vassals including Necho I and his son in Sais, the future great pharaoh Psamtik I. In 663 BC, Tantamani managed a short-lived reconquest of Memphis, killing Necho I in the process, but was beaten during the ensuing campaign by Ashurbanipal, which finished with the sack of Thebes that same year. Weakened, the Kushites could not resist the subsequent rise of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt under the impulse of Psamtik I, who proceeded south quickly during the remainder of Tantamani's reign, definitively expelling him from Upper Egypt c. 656 BC. Thus, in contrast to his predecessors, Atlanersa's kingdom was restricted to the region of Kush, south of Elephantine, and its seat of power was Napata. The Kushites would nonetheless continue to wield a significant influence in the Theban region of Upper Egypt where an aristocracy of Nubian descent had established itself in the 8th century BC, in particular amongst the high clergy of Amun. Louvre Museum, Paris Despite these developments, Atlanersa adopted the fivefold titulary in the style of Egyptian pharaohs; gave himself the epithets of \\"Son of Ra\\" and \\"King of Upper and Lower Egypt\\" in his inscriptions; and had the gods promise him lordship over Egypt in exchange for Temple B700. While Atlanersa's Horus name, \\"Founder of the two lands\\", is identical with that of the much earlier king of the 13th Dynasty, Neferhotep I, T√∂r√∂k proposes that it is rather based on the titles of Theban kings of the Third Intermediate Period. For example, starting with the High-priest of Amun Herihor (fl. c. 1080 BC), a number of rulers of the 21st and 22nd Dynasties were called \\"son of Amun whom he placed on his throne to be founder of the Two Lands\\", a prominent example being Osorkon I (fl. c. 900 BC). In the same vein, Atlanersa's nebty name of \\"Mery Maat\\" was also borne by the kings Siamun (fl. c. 970 BC), Osorkon II (fl. c. 850 BC) and Shoshenq III (fl. c. 810 BC). Serge Sauneron and Jean Yoyotte proposed that either Atlanersa or Senkamanisken faced an incursion of Egyptian troops under the command of Psamtik I, who very probably also established a garrison on Elephantine to guard the border. This hypothesis is contested by T√∂r√∂k, who points to the lack of direct evidence. In any case, a raid on Napata by the Egyptians did take place during the later reign of Psamtik II c. 593 BC. During this raid, the colossal statue of Atlanersa in front of Temple B700 was toppled and its head cut off.

A turbine blade is the individual component which makes up the turbine section of a gas turbine or steam turbine. The blades are responsible for extracting energy from the high temperature, high pressure gas produced by the combustor. The turbine blades are often the limiting component of gas turbines.Boyce, p. 368. To survive in this difficult environment, turbine blades often use exotic materials like superalloys and many different methods of cooling that can be categorized as internal and external cooling , and thermal barrier coatings. Blade fatigue is a major source of failure in steam turbines and gas turbines. Fatigue is caused by the stress induced by vibration and resonance within the operating range of machinery. To protect blades from these high dynamic stresses, friction dampers are used. Blades of wind turbines and water turbines are designed to operate in different conditions, which typically involve lower rotational speeds and temperatures. Introduction Diagram of a twin spool jet engine. The high-pressure turbine is connected by a single spool to the high-pressure compressor (purple)- and the low-pressure turbine is connected to the low-pressure compressor by a second spool (green). In a gas turbine engine, a single turbine section is made up of a disk or hub that holds many turbine blades. That turbine section is connected to a compressor section via a shaft (or \\"spool\\"), and that compressor section can either be axial or centrifugal. Air is compressed, raising the pressure and temperature, through the compressor stages of the engine. The temperature is then greatly increased by combustion of fuel inside the combustor, which sits between the compressor stages and the turbine stages. The high-temperature and high-pressure exhaust gases then pass through the turbine stages. The turbine stages extract energy from this flow, lowering the pressure and temperature of the air and transfer the kinetic energy to the compressor stages along the spool. This process is very similar to how an axial compressor works, only in reverse.Flack, p. 406 The number of turbine stages varies in different types of engines, with high- bypass-ratio engines tending to have the most turbine stages. The number of turbine stages can have a great effect on how the turbine blades are designed for each stage. Many gas turbine engines are twin-spool designs, meaning that there is a high-pressure spool and a low-pressure spool. Other gas turbines use three spools, adding an intermediate-pressure spool between the high- and low-pressure spool. The high-pressure turbine is exposed to the hottest, highest-pressure air, and the low-pressure turbine is subjected to cooler, lower-pressure air. The difference in conditions leads to the design of high- pressure and low-pressure turbine blades that are significantly different in material and cooling choices even though the aerodynamic and thermodynamic principles are the same.Flack, p. 407 Under these severe operating conditions inside the gas and steam turbines, the blades face high temperature, high stresses, and potentially high vibrations. Steam turbine blades are critical components in power plants which convert the linear motion of high-temperature and high-pressure steam flowing down a pressure gradient into a rotary motion of the turbine shaft.Bhagi LK, Rastogi V, Gupta P (2013).Fractographic investigations of the failure of L-1 low pressure steam turbine blade. Case Studies in Engineering Failure Analysis, 1(2), pp.72‚Äì78 Environment and failure modes Turbine blades are subjected to very strenuous environments inside a gas turbine. They face high temperatures, high stresses, and a potential environment of high vibration. All three of these factors can lead to blade failures, potentially destroying the engine, therefore turbine blades are carefully designed to resist these conditions.Flack, p. 429. Turbine blades are subjected to stress from centrifugal force (turbine stages can rotate at tens of thousands of revolutions per minute (RPM)) and fluid forces that can cause fracture, yielding, or creepCreep is the tendency of a solid material to slowly move or deform permanently under the influence of stresses. It occurs as a result of long term exposure to high levels of stress that are below the yield strength of the material. Creep is more severe in materials that are subjected to heat for long periods, and near the melting point. Creep always increases with temperature. From Creep (deformation). failures. Additionally, the first stage (the stage directly following the combustor) of a modern gas turbine faces temperatures around ,Flack, p. 410 up from temperatures around in early gas turbines. Modern military jet engines, like the Snecma M88, can see turbine temperatures of .Dexclaux, Jacques and Serre, Jacque (2003). \\"M88-2 E4: Advanced New Generation Engine for Rafale Multirole Fighter\\". AIAA/ICAS International Air and Space Symposium and Exposition: The Next 100 Years. 14‚Äì17 July 2003, Dayton, Ohio. AIAA 2003-2610 Those high temperatures can weaken the blades and make them more susceptible to creep failures. The high temperatures can also make the blades susceptible to corrosion failures. Finally, vibrations from the engine and the turbine itself can cause fatigue failures. Materials A key limiting factor in early jet engines was the performance of the materials available for the hot section (combustor and turbine) of the engine. The need for better materials spurred much research in the field of alloys and manufacturing techniques, and that research resulted in a long list of new materials and methods that make modern gas turbines possible.Koff, Bernard L. (2003). \\"Gas Turbine Technology Overview ‚Äì A Designer's Perspective\\". AIAA/ICAS International Air and Space Symposium and Exposition: The Next 100 Years. 14‚Äì17 July 2003, Dayton, Ohio. AIAA 2003-2722. One of the earliest of these was Nimonic, used in the British Whittle engines. The development of superalloys in the 1940s and new processing methods such as vacuum induction melting in the 1950s greatly increased the temperature capability of turbine blades. Further processing methods like hot isostatic pressing improved the alloys used for turbine blades and increased turbine blade performance. Modern turbine blades often use nickel-based superalloys that incorporate chromium, cobalt, and rhenium. Aside from alloy improvements, a major breakthrough was the development of directional solidification (DS) and single crystal (SC) production methods. These methods help greatly increase strength against fatigue and creep by aligning grain boundaries in one direction (DS) or by eliminating grain boundaries altogether (SC). SC research began in the 1960s with Pratt and Whitney and took about 10 years to be implemented. One of the first implementations of DS was with the J58 engines of the SR-71. A turbine blade with thermal barrier coating. Another major improvement to turbine blade material technology was the development of thermal barrier coatings (TBC). Where DS and SC developments improved creep and fatigue resistance, TBCs improved corrosion and oxidation resistance, both of which became greater concerns as temperatures increased. The first TBCs, applied in the 1970s, were aluminide coatings. Improved ceramic coatings became available in the 1980s. These coatings increased turbine blade temperature capability by about 200 ¬∞F (90 ¬∞C). The coatings also improve blade life, almost doubling the life of turbine blades in some cases.Boyce, p. 449 Most turbine blades are manufactured by investment casting (or lost-wax processing). This process involves making a precise negative die of the blade shape that is filled with wax to form the blade shape. If the blade is hollow (i.e., it has internal cooling passages), a ceramic core in the shape of the passage is inserted into the middle. The wax blade is coated with a heat-resistant material to make a shell, and then that shell is filled with the blade alloy. This step can be more complicated for DS or SC materials, but the process is similar. If there is a ceramic core in the middle of the blade, it is dissolved in a solution that leaves the blade hollow. The blades are coated with a TBC, and then any cooling holes are machined.Flack, p. 430-3 Ceramic matrix composites (CMC), where fibers are embedded in a matrix of polymer derived ceramics, are being developed for use in turbine blades. The main advantage of CMCs over conventional superalloys is their light weight and high temperature capability. SiC/SiC composites consisting of silicon matrix reinforced by silicon carbide fibers have been shown to withstand operating temperatures 200¬∞-300 ¬∞F higher than nickel superalloys. GE Aviation successfully demonstrated the use of such SiC/SiC composite blades for the low-pressure turbine of its F414 jet engine.

Cooling At a constant pressure ratio, thermal efficiency of the engine increases as the turbine entry temperature (TET) increases. However, high temperatures can damage the turbine, as the blades are under large centrifugal stresses and materials are weaker at high temperature. So, turbine blade cooling is essential. Current modern turbine designs are operating with inlet temperatures higher than 1900 kelvins which is achieved by actively cooling the turbine components . Methods of cooling V2500 nozzle guide vane Cooling of components can be achieved by air or liquid cooling. Liquid cooling seems to be more attractive because of high specific heat capacity and chances of evaporative cooling but there can be leakage, corrosion, choking and other problems. which works against this method. On the other hand, air cooling allows the discharged air into main flow without any problem. Quantity of air required for this purpose is 1‚Äì3% of main flow and blade temperature can be reduced by 200‚Äì300 ¬∞C. There are many techniques of cooling used in gas turbine blades; convection, film, transpiration cooling, cooling effusion, pin fin cooling etc. which fall under the categories of internal and external cooling. While all methods have their differences, they all work by using cooler air (often bled from the compressor) to remove heat from the turbine blades.Flack, p.428. Internal coolingConvection cooling= Blade cooling by convection It works by passing cooling air through passages internal to the blade. Heat is transferred by conduction through the blade, and then by convection into the air flowing inside of the blade. A large internal surface area is desirable for this method, so the cooling paths tend to be serpentine and full of small fins. The internal passages in the blade may be circular or elliptical in shape. Cooling is achieved by passing the air through these passages from hub towards the blade tip. This cooling air comes from an air compressor. In case of gas turbine the fluid outside is relatively hot which passes through the cooling passage and mixes with the main stream at the blade tip.Boyce, p. 370. =Impingement cooling= Impingement A variation of convection cooling, impingement cooling, works by hitting the inner surface of the blade with high velocity air. This allows more heat to be transferred by convection than regular convection cooling does. Impingement cooling is used in the regions of greatest heat loads. In case of turbine blades, the leading edge has maximum temperature and thus heat load. Impingement cooling is also used in mid chord of the vane. Blades are hollow with a core. There are internal cooling passages. Cooling air enters from the leading edge region and turns towards the trailing edge. External coolingFilm cooling= Rendering of a turbine blade with cooling holes for film cooling. Film cooling Film cooling (also called thin film cooling), a widely used type, allows for higher cooling effectiveness than either convection and impingement cooling.Volume 1. Performance Flight Testing Phase. Chapter 7. Aero Propulsion page 7.122. Edwards Air Force Base, Air Force Test Center, February 1991. Size: 8MB. mirror of ADA320315.pdf This technique consists of pumping the cooling air out of the blade through multiple small holes or slots in the structure. A thin layer (the film) of cooling air is then created on the external surface of the blade, reducing the heat transfer from main flow, whose temperature (1300‚Äì1800 kelvins) can exceed the melting point of the blade material (1300‚Äì1400 kelvins).What is Film Cooling?Martinez, Isidoro. \\"Aircraft propulsion. Thermal and mechanical limitations in jet engines\\" page 19. Technical University of Madrid, School of Aeronautical Engineering, 2015. Retrieved: April 2015. The ability of the film cooling system to cool the surface is typically evaluated using a parameter called cooling effectiveness. Higher cooling effectiveness (with maximum value of one) indicates that the blade material temperature is closer to the coolant temperature. In locations where the blade temperature approaches the hot gas temperature, the cooling effectiveness approaches to zero. The cooling effectiveness is mainly affected by the coolant flow parameters and the injection geometry. Coolant flow parameters include the velocity, density, blowing and momentum ratios which are calculated using the coolant and mainstream flow characteristics. Injection geometry parameters consist of hole or slot geometry (i.e. cylindrical, shaped holes or slots) and injections angle . A United States Air Force program in the early 1970s funded the development of a turbine blade that was both film and convection cooled, and that method has become common in modern turbine blades. Injecting the cooler bleed into the flow reduces turbine isentropic efficiency; the compression of the cooling air (which does not contribute power to the engine) incurs an energetic penalty; and the cooling circuit adds considerable complexity to the engine. All of these factors have to be compensated by the increase in overall performance (power and efficiency) allowed by the increase in turbine temperature.Boyce, p. 379-80 In recent years, researchers have suggested using plasma actuator for film cooling. The film cooling of turbine blades by using a dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator was first proposed by Roy and Wang S. Roy, C.-C. Wang, Plasma actuated heat transfer, Appl. Phys. Lett. 92 (2008) 231501. A horseshoe-shaped plasma actuator, which is set in the vicinity of holes for gas flow, has been shown to improve the film cooling effectiveness significantly. Following the previous research, recent reports using both experimental and numerical methods demonstrated the effect of cooling enhancement by 15% using a plasma actuator.P. Audier, M., N. Benard, E. Moreau, Film cooling effectiveness enhancement using surface dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator, Int. J. Heat Fluid Flow 62 (2016), 247‚Äì57. S. Dai, Y. Xiao, L. He, T. Jin, P.

Hou, Investigation of film cooling from cylindrical hole with plasma actuator on flat plate, Heat Mass Transf. 52 (2016), 1571‚Äì83. =Cooling effusion= Cooling by effusion The blade surface is made of porous material which means having a large number of small orifices on the surface. Cooling air is forced through these porous holes which forms a film or cooler boundary layer. Besides this uniform cooling is caused by effusion of the coolant over the entire blade surface. =Pin fin cooling= In the narrow trailing edge film cooling is used to enhance heat transfer from the blade. There is an array of pin fins on the blade surface. Heat transfer takes place from this array and through the side walls. As the coolant flows across the fins with high velocity, the flow separates and wakes are formed. Many factors contribute towards heat transfer rate among which the type of pin fin and the spacing between fins are the most significant. =Transpiration cooling= This is similar to film cooling in that it creates a thin film of cooling air on the blade, but it is different in that air is \\"leaked\\" through a porous shell rather than injected through holes. This type of cooling is effective at high temperatures as it uniformly covers the entire blade with cool air.Flack, p. 428-9 Transpiration-cooled blades generally consist of a rigid strut with a porous shell. Air flows through internal channels of the strut and then passes through the porous shell to cool the blade.Boyce, p. 375 As with film cooling, increased cooling air decreases turbine efficiency, therefore that decrease has to be balanced with improved temperature performance.

The play takes place in Auschwitz during World War II. The Jewish prisoners put God on trial in absentia for abandoning the Jewish people. The question is whether God has broken his covenant with the Jewish people by allowing the Germans to commit genocide. It was produced and shown by the BBC on 3 September 2008. Production was supported by PBS, which screened the play as part of its Masterpiece anthology. The play is based on an event described by Elie Wiesel in his book The Trial of God, though Boyce describes this tale as \\"apocryphal\\". According to Boyce, producer Mark Redhead \\"had been trying to turn the story into a film for almost 20 years by the time he called me in 2005 to write the screenplay.\\" However, Wiesel later confirmed that the story was true, and that he was personally witness to it.

The same game is also played by the Incas under the name Taptana, Komina, Comina, Cumi, Puma, or Inca Chess. In modern Quechua, the language of the ethnolinguistic group that are the descendants of the Incas, Taptana means \\"chess\\". It is known by the Aymaras, a neighboring ethnolinguistic group to the Quechuan people, as kumisi√±a. Throughout South America the game is known as El le√≥n y las ovejas which literally means \\"the lion and the sheep\\". The lion is actually a puma as there are no lions native to the Americas. The Mapuches also call it El Leoncito. J. I. Molina, in 1787, described it as ‚Äòel artificioso juego del ajedrez, al cual dan el nombre de comican‚Äô which translates to \\"the ingenious game of chess to which they (the Mapuche) give the name comican\\". Komikan may actually be the same game as Adugo (Jaguar and Dogs) as played by the Boror√≥ people of Brazil. in 1898, Stewart Culin, the famed anthropologist, named a game played in Peru as Solitario. The same name was also used by the game historian, Murray, in 1952. The game may also be known in Peru as Kukuli. Komikan is a hunt game, and specifically a tiger hunt game (or tiger game) since it uses an expanded Alquerque board. Like all hunt games, there are two unequal forces at play. In Komikan, one player has only a single piece, usually called a \\"puma\\" or \\"jaguar\\", or \\"kom ikelu\\" (in Mapuche language \\"the one which eats all\\"), or \\"leon\\" (Spanish for lion), which can move one space at a time or capture the other player's pieces by hopping over them. The other player has twelve pieces (usually called a \\"sheep\\" or \\"goat\\" or \\"dogs\\"), or perros or perritos which is Spanish for \\"dogs\\" and \\"little dogs\\" respectively, that can only move one space at a time, but not capture, and attempts only to surround and immobilize the puma or jaguar. Pieces must move and/or capture following the pattern on the board. The expanded Alquerque board consist of an Alquerque board and a triangular patterned board attached on one of its side. There are different triangular patterned board designs attached to the Alquerque board, and therefore Komikan has several variants. The standard triangular board (with one horizontal line across the breadth of the triangle, and one vertical line along the length of the triangle) described by Stewart Culin in 1898 (as Solitario) is only one of them. In 1918-19, Matus Z. described a Komikan board with a triangular board with two horizontal lines across its breadth, a single vertical line along its length, and two shorter vertical lines where the shorter horizontal line (the one closest to the Alquerque board) intersects with the triangle's two sides. Another board described in 1980 by J. Alcina Franch described a Taptana board with a heart-shaped triangular board with a curve line connecting to a little circle that touches the Alquerque board. This board was found at Chinchero, Peru near the capitol, Cuzco, scratched on a Pre-Hispanic wall. This board has been used as an argument that Komikan or Taptana is a Pre-Hispanic or Pre-Columbian indigenous game of South America. The last Inca emperor Atahualpa is shown on an illustration to play taptana in the Cajamarca jail with his Spanish guard (from Waman Puma de Ayala in his book written in 1615 pgs. 388, 390) before his death in 1533. The Taptana board, however, is missing a triangular board attached to it, and therefore, it looks to be a standard Alquerque board. Whether or not Komikan or Taptana is indigenous to South America, all other sources so far are after Columbus' discovery of the Americas. Another early description of the Mapuche (Araucanian) game was described by J. I. Molina in 1787. It described that the sheep or goats step forward. The puma or jaguar (or leon) was allowed to make multiple short leaps in capturing the sheep or goats.

It is a mixture of romantic fantasy which also fits into the kemonomimi genre. It is about Kogane Mikasa, a kitsunemimi (fox-girl), who is half-human and half-demon. She enters the human world via a shrine run by her aunt and uncle, and dedicated to her father. When she arrives into the human world, she encounters a trainee priest and heir to the shrine Jin Mikasa. Kogane forms a friendship with Jin after she kisses him. When they kiss, Kogane is able to achieve her ambition of turning into a human, albeit temporarily. The series published five volumes published by Studio DNA in Japanese between November 26, 2002 and March 3, 2005. Recently, it has been published in English. The first volume was released by Tokyopop on May 1, 2008, and the second on July 2010. Plot Jin Mikasa is the heir to the Mikasa shrine, currently seen over by his father and dedicated to Doukan-San. One day, a mysterious fox-girl called Kogane Mikasa appears at the shrine, who claims to be half-human and half-demon. She first stays with Jin and Sogo Aoyagi, a childhood friend of Jin's who is self-centered at times. Worried about Doukan-San discovering her, Jin and Kogane hide in Sogo's wardrobe, where they accidentally kiss. The kiss causes her to lose her fox- like appearances and turn into a human, something she has always wanted. However, the change is only temporarily and she needs to be kissed repeatedly to remain human. Also, she cannot use magic when she is human. Her fate is determined by who she marries, and she wants to marry a human, specifically Jin, and be human. Doukan-San discovers where Kogane is hiding, but Jin is surprised to learn that she is Doukan-San's daughter, with him being a demon and his wife being a human. Jin is also surprised to learn that Kogane's mother is his aunt and that Kogane is his cousin. Kogane stays in the human world and learns to adapt to it. She eventually goes to Jin's school, where she meets Kanoto Okubo, another of Jin's school friends, and occult club member Sachi Usui, who brings Izume-Chan, a weasel-girl who was Kogane's long- time friend [currently angry at Kogane], to the human world. Reception Foxy Lady has had mixed reviews. Leroy Douresseaux from comicbookbin.com praised the art, but went onto say that, \\"For the most part, Foxy Lady is a comic fantasy romp, although there are many romantic moments. The narrative feels awkward when Tachibana tries to force this to be a fantasy romance and the pace becomes clunky with too many dry spots ‚Äì more stops than starts. In the second half of this volume, the stories focus on fantasy scenarios with comic implications, rather than romantic one; then, Foxy Lady really starts to come to life. It will be interesting to see where this goes.\\" Nadia Oxford of mania.com was more critical saying, \\"Foxy Lady isn't terrible; it's just manga at its most typical. The jokes are stale, as are the character designs. With dozens of quality titles out there, there's simply no reason to pick it up. Thinking about it though, creating a mediocre title is worse than creating a bad one: bad books, movies and manga are acknowledged through word of mouth. Mediocre works just fade into obscurity and then fall into the bargain bin, which is the next dimension Foxy Lady is destined for.\\" Holly Ellingwood from activeanime.com was more positive about Foxy Lady, stating that, \\"Foxy Lady has a rich and glossy style that is imminently attractive. Being a romantic comedy, bordering on harem, it has excellent and gorgeous female character designs. But the artist doesn't shirk on the male characters either, giving them appealing detail and style as well. The illustrations are competent and confident enough that it makes the manga easily imagined as an anime due to its fluidity and high quality imagery.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Fantasy anime and manga Category:Ichijinsha manga Category:Kemonomimi Category:Romance anime and manga Category:Tokyopop titles ","title":"Foxy Lady (manga)"},{"id":"18675053","text":"Vadamanappakkam is a village located in the Tiruvannamalai district of Tamil Nadu, South India.

Tanks are part of an ancient tradition of harvesting and preserving the local rainfall and water from streams and rivers for later use, primarily for agriculture and drinking water, but also for sacred bathing and rituals. Often a tank was constructed across a slope so to collect and store water by taking advantage of local mounds and depressions. Tank use is critical, especially in parts of South India without perennial rainfall where water supply replenishment is dependent on a cycle of dry seasons alternating with monsoon seasons.

In video production, this tone is usually accompanied by a test card so the video programming may be calibrated as well.

This is also the \\"bleep\\" tone commonly used to censor obscene or sensitive audio content. In music Many electronic tuners used by musicians emit a tone of 440Hz, corresponding to a pitch of A above Middle C (A4). More sophisticated tuners offer a choice of other reference pitches to account for differences in tuning. Some specialized tuners offer pitches used commonly on a particular instrument (standard guitar tuning, fifth intervals for string instruments, the open tones for various brass instruments).

He is the winner of several international prizes in the philosophy of science, and was previously editor of Biology and Philosophy. He is also a member of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. He is currently the First Vice President of the Division for Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science and Technology of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science and Technology (2020-2023). Work Sterelny's principal area of research is in the philosophy of biology. He states \\"the development of evolutionary biology since 1858 is one of the great intellectual achievements of science.\\" Sterelny has also written extensively about the philosophy of psychology. He is the author of many important papers in these areas,http://www.victoria.ac.nz/hppi/staff/kim-sterelny.aspx including widely anthologised papers on group selection, meme theory and cultural evolution such as \\"Return of the Gene\\" (with Philip Kitcher), \\"Memes Revisited\\" and \\"The Evolution and Evolvability of Culture.\\" Together with his former student Paul Griffiths, in 1999, Sterelny published Sex and Death, a comprehensive treatment of problems and alternative positions in the philosophy of biology. This book incorporated a number of the positions developed in previous articles on the range of topics in the philosophy of biology. At certain points Sterelny and his coauthor differed (for example, on the Darwinian treatment of emotions and on the prospects for developmental systems theory). In 2004 Sterelny's book Thought in a Hostile World: The Evolution of Human Cognition received the Lakatos Award for a distinguished contribution to the philosophy of science. This book provides a Darwinian account of the nature and evolution of human cognitive capacities, and is an important alternative to nativist accounts familiar from evolutionary psychology. By combining an account of neural plasticity, group selection, and niche construction, Sterelny shows how much of the data on which nativist accounts rely can be accounted for without attributing a large number of genetically hardwired modules to the mind/brain. In 2008 Sterelny was awarded the Jean-Nicod Prize. His lectures are published under the title, The Evolved Apprentice. These lectures build on the non-nativist Darwinian approach of Thought in a Hostile World, while providing a discussion of a great deal of recent work by other philosophers, biological anthropologists and ecologists, gene-culture co- evolution theorists, and evolutionary game theorists.

He was the first DPP to be appointed after the transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong on 1 July 1997, and the appointment signalled that suitably qualified expatriates who were committed to Hong Kong still had a role to play in government in the post-colonial era. A career prosecutor, Cross was the seventh holder of the post since its creation in 1979, and the longest serving. On 26 June 2011, he was elected the Vice-Chairman (Senate) of the International Association of Prosecutors, of which he is a Senator-for-Life. Education and early career Ian Grenville Cross (he would later drop his forename) was the eldest son of Lt Col JA Cross (dec'd), formerly of the Intelligence Corps, the Lancashire Fusiliers (XX Regiment of Foot) and the Suffolk Regiment (XII Regiment of Foot), and his late wife, Doreen (n√©e Hyde). He was educated privately at Culford School (1959‚Äì69), Suffolk, England, where he chaired the Debating Society. In 1973, he graduated in law from the University of Southampton, where, at different times, he chaired both the Conservative and Unionist Association and the Conservative Monday Club. He read for the Bar at the College of Law, Chancery Lane, London EC4 (1973‚Äì74). Cross was called to the Bar of England and Wales in 1974 by the Middle Temple, of which he was a Blackstone Entrance Exhibitioner (major), and was admitted in 1981 to the Bar of Hong Kong. He practised on the South Eastern Circuit of England and Wales, from the chambers of Jeffrey Thomas, QC, MP, at No. 3 Temple Gardens, London, EC4, from 1974 to 1976. He was then appointed an in- house prosecutor by HM Customs and Excise Department for England and Wales, from 1976 to 1978. He joined the Attorney General's Chambers (now the Department of Justice) of Hong Kong as Crown Counsel in 1978. Cross was the founding chairman of the Charles James Fox Society, of which Group Captain Maurice Fox-Strangways, 9th Earl of Ilchester, a descendant of the statesman, was patron. The Society met annually at the Intrepid Fox public house, in Soho, and at the Fox memorial, in Bloomsbury Square, on the anniversary of his death, for remembrance. The Society promoted an awareness of the life and achievements of the erstwhile Whig leader and foreign secretary. Career in public prosecutions As DPP, Cross, with the support of Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung, initiated a programme of modernisation, transparency and internationalisation, to promote the One country, two systems formula in Hong Kong in the area of public prosecutions. He introduced three strategic reviews, designed to strengthen his Office. He created a new sub-division for appellate advocacy, with a mandate to enhance the standards of prosecution in the appeal courts. He expanded his Office to develop its capacity to prosecute all types of crime, appointed Prosecution Policy Co-ordinators to provide expert advice within their portfolios, and created the Computer Crime Team.Prosecutions Division 2000@12‚Äì13 Cross established the Standing Committee on Disclosure, to keep the disclosure arrangements of prosecutors under regular review. He developed close links with victim groups, most notably Against Child Abuse, many of which met directly with prosecutors. He arranged advanced training courses for prosecutors at all levels, and introduced training seminars for private counsel who prosecute on the DPP's fiat. Close ties were also forged with prosecutors in other jurisdictions, and he lectured widely in Mainland China and Macao. Prior to his appointment as DPP, Cross served, from 1991 to 1997, as the Deputy DPP of Hong Kong, specialising in appellate advocacy. In that capacity, he prosecuted the last criminal case from Hong Kong to be heard by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (R v Peter Maclennan), in June 1997, and the first criminal case to be heard by the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong (HKSAR v Mui Po Chu), in September 1997. He conducted twelve appeals before the Judicial Committee between 1988 and 1997, and, after the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong, he prosecuted six appeals before the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (and its Appeal Committee), which replaced the Judicial Committee as Hong Kong's ultimate appellate body on 1 July 1997. As a Senior Assistant Crown Prosecutor, Cross headed the Criminal Appeals Unit of the then Legal Department of Hong Kong, from 1986 to 1991. Prior to that, he was, from 1978 to 1986, a general prosecutor in the department, conducting criminal trials in the High Court, District Court and Magistrates Court. Cross was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1990, becoming Senior Counsel in 1997, following the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong. Aged 38, he was the youngest prosecutor to have taken silk in Hong Kong, a distinction that he retains. From 1999 to 2010, Cross served as an Official Justice of the Peace (JP). The Hong Kong Tourism Board appointed Cross as its Hong Kong Convention Ambassador for 2003 to 2005, and again for 2006‚Äì07. Cross was awarded the Silver Bauhinia Star (SBS) in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Establishment Day Honours List 2010.

He contributed to all fields of physical chemistry and was instrumental in establishing theoretical chemistry by developing Ligand field theory (1947) and other quantum chemical models including the Hartmann Potential (1971). He also formulated a new perturbation theory (1970‚Äì1977) as part of his pioneering research towards a unified field theory of chemical bonding based on a non-linear Schr√∂dinger equation (1980). Biography Hermann Hartmann has been a universal personality with highly developed intuition, admired as an excellent teacher and author of more than 250 scientific papers published in journals of physical and theoretical chemistry. 1933‚Äì1952 In 1933 H. Hartmann started the study of chemistry in Munich, where he got strongly influenced and supported by Arnold Sommerfeld. 1939 he continued his studies in Frankfurt where he received his PhD 1941. In 1943 he habilitated on the applications of the H√ºckel theory. 1946 he became Docent in Frankfurt. Together with F. Ilse, his first student, he developed Ligand field theory a mayor advance in the understanding of complex compounds. In 1951 he became leader of a division in the Max-Planck- Institute for Physical Chemistry in G√∂ttingen but returned to Frankfurt a year later. 1952‚Äì1962 1952 Hartmann was appointed as Director of the Institute of Physical Chemistry at the University of Frankfurt. His research covered all areas of physical and theoretical chemistry. In his spectroscopic studies he applied all available techniques from x-ray, optical, infrared, microwave, NMR to mass spectrometry. His investigations of kinetic processes include reactions with peptides, organic radicals as well as studied on the influence of pressure and solvation. In his theoretical work Hartmann emphasis on exact solvable models (model quantum chemistry) rather than numerical ab initio calculations . His main book ‚ÄûQuantum mechanical theory of chemical bonding‚Äú ( \\"Theorie der chemischen Bindung auf quantentheoretischer Grundlage\\") appeared 1954. Through his publications and lectures he influenced considerably the development of quantum chemistry in Germany. 1962‚Äì1972 Through the support of the German Research Foundation (DFG) in the early 60th Hartmann could expand his group of researchers. Among the 20 theoreticists and about 100 scientists working and teaching at Hartmann's Institute were H. L. Schl√§fer, G. Gliemann, H. Sillescu, G.H. Kohlmeier, K. Helfrich, E. A. Reinsch, H. v. Hirschhausen, K. Jug, J. Heidberg, H. Heydmann, H. Kelm, H. W. Spiess. With the support of his group Hartmann focused on getting students interested in theoretical chemistry by arranging regular summer schools in theoretical chemistry held mostly at Konstanz/Bodensee. 1962 Hartmann started Theoretica Chimica Acta a peer-reviewed scientific journal publishing original research and review articles in theoretical chemistry. Articles could be submitted in English, German, French and also Latin, but only one article was ever written in Latin. 1984 shortly before his death Hartmann turned the editorship over to K. Ruedenberg, Iowa State University. After Ruedenberg's retirement 1997, the name of Theoretica Chimica Acta (TCA) was broadened to Theoretical Chemistry Accounts: Theory, Computation, and Modeling, still keeping its initials TCA, with the new editor Donald G. Truhlar, University of Minnesota. TCA documents the growth of the field of theoretical chemistry and contributed significantly to the progress of theoretical chemistry in Germany. 1965 Hartmann organized the first Theoretical Chemistry Symposia ( \\"Symposium f√ºr Theoretische Chemie\\"). The initial goal of the annual meetings was to provide a regular platform for theoreticians from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland to meet with experimentalist. In the organization committee Hartmann was supported by H. Labhart (Z√ºrich), and 0.E. Polansky (Vienna) ‚Äì to which at a later time W.A. Bingel (G√∂ttingen), E. Ruch (Berlin), G. Wagniere (Z√ºrich), and P. Schuster (Vienna) were added. Since 1992 the symposium organizer is selected by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Theoretische Chemie (AGTC), founded to give this field a more official status in concert with the established professional organizations of chemistry, physical chemistry, and physics. The symposium is since then the annual meeting for theoretical chemists from the German speaking countries The location of these meetings varies in the series between Germany-Switzerland-Germany-Austria. Through all the efforts initiated by H. Hartmann theoretical chemistry started to influence not only chemical research in Germany but slowly became an independent field for which new professorships were created at universities. 1972‚Äì1984 In the 70th experimental research at the Hartmann Institute of physical chemistry focused on ion-molecule reactions using ion-cyclotron resonance spectroscopy with K.-P. Wanczek as leading researcher who 1976 became Professor at the University of Bremen. The theoretical foundations of this research were developed in collaboration with K.-M.. Chung, M. W. Morsy, and D. Schuch theoretical physicists working at Hartmann's Institute for Theoretical Chemistry. Since 1973 H. Hartmann also had a small research institute at his place of living in Glash√ºtten (Taunus) supported by the Mainzer Akademie der Wissenschaften und Literatur. Together with K.-M. Chung, D. Schuch, W. Ulmer and B. Zeiger a unified understanding of molecular interactions was developed based on a nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation. Hartmann thereby pioneered the discovery of one self-interacting field as the foundation of chemistry. H. Hartman emerited in 1982 and died two years later. H. Hartmann was honoured as member of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina, the Gesellschaft √ñsterreichischer Chemiker, the Accademia Nazionale die Lincei, the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, the Comitato Premio of Fondazione Balzan, the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science, and the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur zu Mainz.

The film based on superstition and black magic. It was declared a blockbuster at the box office by several media outlets.Box Office: Phoonk in success wave ‚Äì  The Economic Times. Economictimes.indiatimes.com (25 August 2008). Retrieved on 2017-05-09. Verma derived the idea for the film from a Hindi news channel which telecasts stories on Black magic. A prize of was announced for those who will watch the film alone in a theatre. The storyline of Phoonk is thematically similar to Telugu thriller novel Tulasi Dalam by Yandamuri Veerendranath. It was remade in Telugu as Raksha. The film was dubbed in Tamil as Bommayi. The film was followed by a sequel, Phoonk 2, in 2010. Plot Phoonk is based upon the concept of black magic. Civil engineer and atheist Rajiv (Sudeep) lives in Mumbai with his wife Aarti (Amruta Khanvilkar), his two kids Raksha (Ahsaas Channa) and Rohan (Shrey Bawa), Rajiv's mother and the housemaid Laxmi (Anu Ansari). Rajiv's most trusted colleagues are Anshuman (Kenny Desai) and Madhu (Ashwini Kalsekar), whom everyone, including Rajiv's friend Vinay and Raksha feel are not normal. During a party at his house, when he comes to know that the husband and wife duo have cheated him on a valuable contract for an IT firm in Delhi, Rajiv fires both of them after insulting them both. Humiliated and angry at this, the two of them decide to take revenge on Rajiv. Madhu notes that Rajiv is very fond of Raksha. Soon a series of strange events start to take place in and around Rajiv's house. Mandar (Bharat Kaul), who is appointed to take the place of Madhu and Anshuman is killed at the construction site mysteriously. Raksha starts to talk and behave weirdly, much to the shock of everyone. Doctors are called for, but the strange behavior continues, with Raksha flying in the air, talking in a manly voice, acting in pain. The superstitious and religious grandmother repeatedly says that someone is using Black Magic on Raksha, but Rajiv and the doctors refuse to believe any of it. Now at the end of his wits, Rajiv begins to look to God. He also agrees to his construction laborers' demand of making a small shrine at the construction site, which he was previously adamantly turning down. Vinay suggests asking for the help of Manja (Zakir Hussain), a magician familiar with this sort of stuff. Manja analyzes the whole situation, sees Raksha, visits Rajiv's house, and tells the latter that someone is trying to take revenge on him, at which Vinay exclaims that it is none other than Madhu and Anshuman. Manja also tells them that Rajiv's driver has been helping the duo by providing them with necessary materials like Raksha's hair, soil from her foot and her toys to perform black magic. Losing no more time, Rajiv, Vinay, Manja rush to Madhu's house, where she and Anshuman are found to be doing black magic rituals on a doll, supposedly an effigy of Raksha to trouble her. Rajiv orders Madhu to stop, but Madhu attacks him with a trishul. Vinay takes on Anshuman. The effect of Black magic forces seep on the entire place, pushing everyone away. As Madhu is going to attack Rajiv who is being pushed towards the wall, Manja uses his powers to separate the running ceiling fan, which lands on Madhu's head, decapitating her. All the negative forces stop, a spider comes out of one of the skulls on the floor and bites the driver who dies. Everyone rushes to the hospital to find that Raksha has completely recovered. Rajiv and Vinay see that everyone thinks it is the doctors who have cured Raksha, and they smile at each other.

The movie opened up after an effective publicity campaign. It was a very low-budget film, which combined with its success at the box office, turned a good profit for its investors.

J. Cronin. The film stars Dirk Bogarde and Jon Whiteley, and was directed by Philip Leacock. The adaptation was filmed both at Pinewood Studios, near London, and in Palam√≥s, nearby Mas Juny estate, and in S'Agaro, on the Costa Brava, Catalonia. There were also two are adaptations of the story for Brazilian television: Nicholas (1958) and O Jardineiro Espanhol (1967). The film was entered into the 7th Berlin International Film Festival. Plot British diplomat Harrington Brande (Sir Michael Hordern) takes up a minor provincial consular post in Spain. The appointment is a disappointment to Harrington, who was hoping for a more senior position. His abandonment by his wife may have adversely affected his career, as might his brusque manner. He is accompanied by his eleven-year-old son, Nicholas (Jon Whiteley), whom he home schools, contrary to his friend's advice that the boy would benefit from the social engagement with other boys at a boarding school. Harrington prefers to monopolize his company. Nicholas sees it as an adventure, and soon becomes friends with the teenage gardener, Jos√© (Sir Dirk Bogarde), spending time every day helping him with the plants and relaxing together. The exercise he is getting is much better for him than his father's mollycoddling of the perfectly healthy boy. However, the middle aged Harrington is jealous of his son's enthusiasm for and friendship with the much younger man. He rebukes his son for taking him to watch Jose play pelota and refuses Jose's gift of fish that he had caught. Similarly, he refuses to let Nicholas join a youth group organised by a junior colleague. He later bans Nicholas and Jose from speaking on pain of Jose's dismissal. He also sets Jose to clear a large rockery as punishment. While Harrington is away on a business trip, the drunken Garcia, the butler/ chauffeur, threatens Nicholas with a knife and tries to break into his bedroom and the terrified boy takes refuge overnight with Jose with whom he has again been spending time. His father discovers this and is furious. Garcia then frames Jos√© to cover up his own behaviour. The ending of the film differs from that of the book.

Hiloni (), plural hilonim (; \\"secular\\"), is a social category in Israel, designating the least religious segment among the Jewish public. The other three subgroups on the scale of Jewish-Israeli religiosity are the masortim, \\"traditional\\", dati'im, \\"religious\\", and haredim, \\"ultra-religious\\". In the 2018 Israel Central Bureau of Statistics' survey, 43.2% of Jews identified as hiloni. Definitions In the Israeli parlance, hiloni is used to identify Jews who observe less traditional practices than the other, more religious, Jewish subgroups (apart from that, the term may also be used as a derogatory epithet by observant Jews, or to be associated with secularism).Charles Liebman, Yaacov Yadgar. Secular-Jewish Identity and the Condition of Secular Judaism in Israel. Rutgers University Press, 2009. Definition: p. 2, beliefs and practice: p. 10-11, 30. Between 2002 and 2018, among Jewish adult respondents to ICBS polls, self-identified hilonim numbered between a maximum of 45% in 2005 and a minimum of 41.4% in 2009. In 2018, the figure was 43.2%. Though hiloni literally means \\"secular\\", many scholars noted it is problematic in translation. Professor Yoav Peled preferred to render it as \\"nonobservant.\\"Yaacov Yadgar, Israel's Jewish Identity Crisis: State and Politics in the Middle East. Cambridge University Press, 2020. p. 71; Ilan Troen, Secular Judaism in Israel, Society, Vol. 53, Issue 2. p. 2; Yoav and Hurit Peled, The Religionization of Israeli Society. Routledge, 2018. pp. 14-15. Kenneth D. Wald and Samuel Shye commented that:Phil Zuckerman (editor), The Nonreligious: Understanding Secular People and Societies. Oxford University Press, 2016. p. 50. It is essential to recall that secularity in Israel is defined in reaction to the extremely stringent demands of Orthodox Judaism and does not necessarily entail a conscious rejection of Jewish religious identity or even necessarily connote indifference. Although their standard of observance is low by Orthodox standards, many of the ostensibly secular exhibit an array of religious acts that would mark them off as fairly religious in the American context. Though the term is misleading, \\"secular\\" is the common label to identify people who do not consistently practice the ritual behavior mandated by Orthodox Judaism. The demarcation between the hiloni category and the nearest, the masorti or \\"traditional\\", is highly porous. Surveys demonstrated that it is not reliant on objective levels of belief or ritual observance, but mainly on socioethnic lines: European- descended Israelis, either native or post-Soviet immigrants, tend to describe themselves as \\"secular\\" even when they observe or believe quite substantially, and Middle Eastern and North African-descended regard themselves as \\"traditional\\" regardless of lifestyle and conviction. Among the MENA- descended, those who aspire to emulate the European-descended also tend to adopt the label hiloni.Charles Liebman, Yaacov Yadgar. Jewish Practice and Popular Culture in Israeli Society. Iyunim B'tkumat Yisrael. Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, 2004. p. 1-2. Many surveys offer to the masortim the sub-category of \\"not very religious/tending to hiloni\\". Between 2002 and 2018, those who identified as such in ICBS polls, ranged from a minimum of 21.4% to a maximum of 28.4% of the entire sample, or roughly two-thirds of all masortim.ICBS 2018 Survey, p. 82 (76). Israeli social scientists measure levels of religiosity/secularity among Jews in terms of practice, not faith, and use the category of \\"totally nonobservant\\" to identify the completely secular. In the 2009 Guttman Center survey, the most comprehensive on the matter, 46% of all respondents reported they were hiloni. About 16% of the entire sample, virtually all of them hiloni, stated they were \\"totally nonobservant\\". Almost all the rest of the hiloni were \\"somewhat observant\\", and a negligible minority stated \\"observance to great extent\\".A Portrait of Israeli Jews: Beliefs, Observance, and Values of Israeli Jews, 2009. Israeli Democracy Institute, 2012. pp. 30, 33, . As many ritual behaviours, like setting a doorpost amulet, are part of Jewish-Israeli lifestyle and lack an overt religious connotation, the \\"totally nonobservant\\" often perform some. In the 1999 Guttman survey, only a third of them did not practice any of the ten common rituals studied.Charles S. Liebman, Elihu Katz, Jewishness of Israelis, The Responses to the Guttman Report. SUNY Press, 2012. pp. 66, 130-131. At the other end, Yaacov Yadgar and Charles Liebman estimated in 2009 that about 25% of the hilonim are highly observant, on par with the more religious subgroups. In matters of faith, four surveys between 2009 and 2019 imply that on average, 60% of the hiloni respondents believe in God, 20% are convinced atheists, and 20% do not believe but \\"sometimes think God exists\\".Shmuel Rosner, ◊û◊ô ◊©◊û◊ê◊û◊ô◊ü: ◊î◊û◊°◊§◊®◊ô◊ù ◊©◊û◊ê◊ó◊ï◊®◊ô ◊î◊ê◊û◊ï◊†◊î ◊ë◊ó◊ë◊®◊î ◊î◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú◊ô◊™. Ma'ariv, 2 November 2019. Pertaining to other supernatural notions, the Guttman surveys and other polls show that a considerable share hold various such: between 25% to 36%, believe that God revealed the Law and precepts at Sinai, that a higher power guides Jewish history, that the Jews are a chosen people and that there is a soul that survives death. Only disbelief in the Messiah and the World to Come closely correlates with self-identification as hiloni.Baruch Kimmerling, ◊û◊î◊í◊®◊ô◊ù, ◊û◊™◊ô◊ô◊©◊ë◊ô◊ù, ◊ô◊ú◊ô◊ì◊ô◊ù: ◊î◊û◊ì◊ô◊†◊î ◊ï◊î◊ó◊ë◊®◊î ◊ë◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ‚Äì ◊ë◊ô◊ü ◊®◊ô◊ë◊ï◊ô ◊™◊®◊ë◊ï◊ô◊ï◊™ ◊ú◊û◊ú◊ó◊û◊ï◊™ ◊™◊®◊ë◊ï◊™. Am Oved, 2004. p. 191. Denominational identification, as known among American and other Western Jews, is mostly irrelevant in the Israeli context. Yet, when asked in the 2015 Pew Research Center survey of Israeli society, 23% of the hiloni respondents identified as Orthodox, 5% as Reform and 2% as Conservative. 64% did not identify with any particular movement.Israel‚Äôs Religiously Divided Society. Pew Research Center, 8 March 2016. While hilonim are often hostile to the state rabbinate, fear the growth of the haredi populace, and oppose further religious legislation in Israel, secularism in the common sense of the word is rather rare in the country. Orthodoxy plays a central role in defining national identity, and religious issues like conversion are regarded as crucial by the vast majority. When \\"separation of religion and state\\" is used in the Israeli context, it is mostly understood as a wish to abolish the many laws curtailing personal freedom, not actual separation.Stephen Sharot, Comparative Perspectives on Judaisms and Jewish Identities. Wayne State University Press, 2011. pp. 232-234; Yaacov Yadgar, Sovereign Jews: Israel, Zionism, and Judaism. State University of New York Press, 2017. pp. 189. This innate tension led to a state of affairs dubbed by Professor Stephen Sharot as \\"secularization without secularism\\": since the 1990's, the demand of both masorti and hiloni Israelis for consumer activity on the Sabbath (technically illegal), non-kosher food and the like, considerably liberalized the public sphere, but barely affected religious legislation and did not introduce principled secularism into the political arena.Guy ben-Porat, Between State and Synagogue: The Secularization of Contemporary Israel.

It was assigned to the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, and formed part of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. The regiment, with an establishment of twenty-six officers, 523 other ranks and 600 horses, was formed from three squadrons belonging to pre-war Territorial Force regiments: the 1st Mounted Rifles (Canterbury Yeomanry Cavalry), the 8th (South Canterbury) Mounted Rifles and the 10th (Nelson) Mounted Rifles. It also included a small headquarters and, until 1916, a Maxim machine-gun section. The Maxim guns were withdrawn but the regiment's fire-power increased during the war, and by the end of the conflict each squadron had four Hotchkiss machine-guns, one per troop. Being mounted infantry the regiment rode into battle on their horses, but were expected to dismount and fight on foot. The regiment fought predominantly against the forces of the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Their first involvement came in the Gallipoli Campaign between May and December 1915, during which they participated in the largest battle of that theatre at Chunuk Bair and the fighting for Hill 60. Evacuated to Egypt, they then took part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign from 1916 to 1918. The early battles they were involved in included those at Romani, Gaza and Beersheba. Later in the war they were part of the force that occupied the Jordan Valley, and took part in the raids on Amman and Es Salt. Their final wartime operation was in connection with the capture of the Turkish Fourth Army. During the four years of war the regiment lost 334 men dead from all causes, while another 720 were wounded or debilitated. After the war, the regiment played a minor role in the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, before being disbanded in June 1919. History The Commanding Officer Lieutenant-Colonel John Findlay Formation Raised on 12 August 1914, at the start of the First World War, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment came from the Canterbury region on the South Island of New Zealand.Powles 1928, p.1 Commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel John Findlay, it was composed of a headquarters, a machine-gun section and three squadrons, formed from Territorial Force regiments. The New Zealand Territorial Force included a compulsory training system, and the four Military Districts were required to supply a mounted regiment for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. To meet that obligation, the Territorial Force regiments each provided a squadron, which kept their own regimental badges and traditions.Waite 1919, p.6 The regiment's squadrons came from the 1st Mounted Rifles (Canterbury Yeomanry Cavalry) (1st Squadron), the 8th (South Canterbury) Mounted Rifles (8th Squadron) and the 10th (Nelson) Mounted Rifles (10th Squadron).Kinloch 2005, p.30 The establishment was fixed at twenty-six officers and 523 other ranks, who used 528 riding horses, seventy-four draught horses and six pack horses. Each squadron, of 158 men, had a field headquarters and four troops. The Machine-Gun Section, with two Maxim Guns, had one officer, twenty-six other ranks, twenty riding horses and sixteen draught horses.Wilkie 1924, p.3 Even though the regiment used horses, they were not cavalry but mounted infantry, and expected to ride to the battlefield, dismount and then fight as traditional infantry.Stack 2011, p.1883 Attached to, but not part of, the regiment were medical and veterinary officers, an artificer, three more other ranks and another eighteen horses. The regiment was assigned to the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, serving alongside two other regiments: the Auckland Mounted Rifles and the Wellington Mounted Rifles.Kinloch 2005, p.4Gullet 1923, p.58 Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment aboard HMNZT Tahita just before leaving Lyttelton in New Zealand Embarkation On 23 September the regiment left their camp for Lyttelton and embarked on the transport ships HMNZT Tahiti and HMNZT Athenic.Powles 1928, p.3 Leaving the same day, they arrived at Wellington the next afternoon, and disembarked the troops. On 14 October they boarded the transports again and set sail.Powles 1928, p.4 With a short stop at Hobart, on 28 October they arrived at Albany, and anchored waiting to be joined by the Australian contingent. The combined convoy sailed on 1 November and reached Colombo on 15 November. Two days later it sailed into the Red Sea, and the Suez Canal.Wilkie 1924, pp.8‚Äì9 Docking at Port Said on 2 December and Alexandria the next day, the regiment disembarked on 4 December and boarded a train for their camp in the Cairo suburb of Zeitoun where they started a training programme, using the desert for manoeuvres, during both day and night.Wilkie 1924, p.11 Gallipoli ANZAC beach-head area defended by the brigade In Egypt the regiment continued its training programme, working from reveille at 05:00 to 17:30 when they stabled their horses at the end of the working day. Every third or fourth night the soldiers performed guard duty or looked after the horses. It was in Egypt that the regiment, and brigade, came under command of the newly formed New Zealand and Australian Division which, along with the 1st Division, made up the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC).Powles 1928, p.12 In April 1915, the division's infantry units left Egypt for an undisclosed destination, and it was not until 1 May that the regiment learned about the Gallipoli landings. Four days later the regiment received news that it would also deploy to Gallipoli, but in a dismounted role without their horses. On 7 May, twenty-six officers and 482 other ranks (some men remaining behind to look after their horses) boarded trains for Alexandria to board their transports.Powles 1928, p.22 They arrived off the Gallipoli peninsula on 12 May, and started to disembark, landing at Anzac Cove.Waite 1919, p.134 By now the troops had been re-equipped for their dismounted role, and carried a rifle with two hundred rounds of ammunition, a small pack, a haversack, mess tins, a bayonet, and an entrenching tool. Once ashore, the regiment camped that night behind the front line.Powles 1928, p.25 The next day, they moved to the left flank in the north to relieve the Royal Naval Brigade. Their trenches stretched from the sea to Walkers Ridge and included two outposts, No.1 Post and No.2 Post.Powles 1928, p.27 The regiment took over on the extreme right, with one squadron in the front line, one squadron in the support trench and the third squadron as the reserve. Next in line to their right, was the Auckland Mounted Rifles, and then the Wellington Mounted Rifles on the left.Wilkie 1924, pp.15‚Äì18Nicol 1921, p.33 However, the regiment had to wait until it got dark before sending men forward to man the two outposts.Powles 1928, p.29 First combat The regiment's first experience of combat started at midnight on 18/19 March when their Turkish opponents opened fire on their trenches.Waite 1919, pp.138‚Äì139 The main assault, in the brigade's sector, was against the Auckland Mounted Rifles; to support them the regiment sent two troops from the 1st and 10th Squadrons and one troop from the 8th Squadron to form their reserve. At daylight, the men manning No.1 Post could see a group of Turks concentrating around \\"The Nek\\" and opened fire on them with a machine-gun, forcing them to withdraw. The Turkish attack continued until that afternoon, when it gradually petered out. It was later estimated that 42,000 Turkish troops had been involved in the attack on the ANZAC beach-head, and by the end of the day 10,000 of them had become casualties. Later that day white flags were observed over the Turkish trenches, and some of their men wandered into no man's land. This was considered a ruse to retrieve arms and ammunition off the dead and to bring forward reinforcements, so the Turks were warned to return to their trenches as the New Zealanders were going to open fire again. A real armistice was arranged for 24 May, between 07:30 and 16:30, when the wounded were brought to safety and the dead buried.Waite 1919, p.143Powles 1928, p.32 Squadrons settled into a routine with twenty-four hours in No.1 and No.2 Posts, twenty-four hours in the main trenches and twenty-four hours in support, then back to the outposts. Their first offensive action came on 28 May, when it was still dark. The Turks had built an outpost only from No.2 Post, so the 1st Squadron charged and captured the position.Waite 1919, p.149 Once it was secured, the 6th Squadron from the Wellington Mounted Rifles provided the garrison for what was now called No.3 Post. They had some difficulties defending it, as the Turks launched a counter-attack to recapture it.Powles 1928, pp.36‚Äì37 After a battle lasting until the next day the 10th Squadron and two troops from the 8th Squadron managed to relieve the Wellington Regiment's survivors and take over the defence of the post.Waite 1919, p.150 Shortly after the relief, it was decided that the position was untenable and it was abandoned.Powles 1928, p.37 Casualties gradually mounted and the regiment's first replacements, three officers and forty-four other ranks, arrived at the end of June.Powles 1928, p.41 Chunuk Bair Chunuk Bair area The objective of the British August offensive was to seize Chunuk Bair, a high point in the Sari Bair mountain range. The New Zealand and Australian Division would provide the attacking force. The initial attack was to clear the Turks from the foothills; this task was given to the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, reinforced by the Maori Pioneer Battalion. The regiment, together with the Otago Mounted Rifles, was to clear Chailak Dere valley, then advance to Aghyl Dere in the north. They also had to capture Taylor's Hollow and Walden's Point, then turn east to capture Beauchop Hill. To reduce noise and maintain stealth, they were ordered to use only their bayonets.Powles 1928, pp.45‚Äì46 At 20:00 on 5 August, the 296 men of the regiment moved forward to No.2 Post in preparation for the attack, which was due to start at 21:00 the next night.Powles 1928, p.47 Their assault started on time, with the 1st and 10th Squadrons forward, followed by the 8th Squadron and Machine-Gun Section in reserve. The leading men met and killed four Turks in an observation post. Then with still around to go, a destroyer's searchlight beam lit up the advancing men, and a Turkish machine-gun opened fire on them. The 10th Squadron charged straight into the Turkish trench, while the 1st Squadron managed to manoeuvre around and attack the machine-gun from the rear. They achieved this without firing a shot or making a sound, and then advanced towards their last objective, Beauchop Hill. The hill was also captured, and the survivors started to dig in.Powles 1928, p.48 Although it had taken all its objectives, the regiment had around forty per cent casualties, including the commanding officer, who was wounded, and the second in command, Major Overton, who had been killed.Powles 1928, p.51 While digging in they were able to observe the rest of the battle, which did not seem to be going well. By the next day, 7 August, Turkish reinforcements were arriving at Chunuk Bair and the attack had failed. Since the start of the battle they had lost twenty-four men dead and sixty men wounded.Powles 1928, pp.53‚Äì54 Now commanded by Major Hutton, from the 10th Squadron, the regiment remained on Bauchop Hill in defence until 15 August, when they moved back to the entrance of Aghyl Dere, then later moved forward and occupied an old Turkish trench.Powles 1928, p.55 Hill 60 At 15:30 on 21 August the Battle for Hill 60 began. Charging straight at the hill, the regiment suffered sixty per cent casualties, among them Hutton in command. He was replaced by Major Hurst, from the 1st Squadron, and they succeeded in capturing the Turkish trench within fifteen minutes of going over the top. But on either side of them the rest of the attack had failed, leaving the regiment and the Otago Mounted Rifles isolated from the rest of the force. Not having the manpower to continue the assault, they were ordered to dig in and hold the position.Powles 1928, pp.56‚Äì57Waite 1919, p.252 They held on until 23 August when they were relieved by the Auckland and Wellington Mounted Rifles.Powles 1928, p.59 Canterbury Mounted Rifles getting ready for the second assault on Hill 60 Gallipoli 27 August 1915 Three days later the regiment returned to their previous position to continue the assault. The attack began at 17:00 on 27 August with the regiment leading the brigade. They charged across the of open ground and into the first Turkish trench. Within minutes they were up and on their way again, and captured the second and third trenches, which they defended all night and through the next day. Casualties had been high; from the 119 men who had started the assault there were now only eighteen left, commanded by the only officer, Captain Gibbs. The brigade's other regiments were in a similar state, but they remained in the trenches until they were relieved after dark on 29 August.Powles 1928, pp.60‚Äì62 Lemnos On 13 September, the brigade, less its machine gunners, was relieved by the 5th Australian Brigade and sailed to the island of Lemnos to rest and recuperate. The regiment's strength was now just one officer and thirty-nine other ranks, twelve of whom were machine-gunners who had to remain at Gallipoli. By now, including the original contingent and their replacements, a total of thirty- two officers and 645 other ranks had served with the regiment at Gallipoli.Powles 1928, p.65 On arrival the regiment came under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel George Stewart. By early October, replacements started arriving to bring the regiment back up to almost full strength. At the end of the month Stewart was evacuated sick, and Major John Studholme, the senior officer with the replacements, assumed temporary command of the regiment. On 10 November they returned to Gallipoli, camping that first night at Bauchop Hill.Powles 1928, pp.67‚Äì68 Evacuation The regiment spent their time building winter quarters, and tunnelling into the hillside to provide protection against shellfire, doing so until 27 November when they moved back into the front line. On 9 December, Major Christopher Powles, the Brigade- Major, took over command of the regiment, with Studholme as the second in command.Powles 1928, p.69 Three days later, the order for the complete evacuation of the peninsula was issued. Men with minor ailments left first, followed by one regiment or battalion from each brigade. The Auckland Mounted Rifles were chosen as the first regiment to leave from the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade,Waite 1919, p.280 which meant that the Canterbury Mounted Rifles had to extend its lines to cover for the Aucklanders. The last men were due to leave over the night of 19/20 December.Powles 1928, pp.71‚Äì72 The last men to be evacuated from Gallipoli, known as \\"The Diehards\\" The regiment now numbered fourteen officers and 290 other ranks, which was to be reduced to nine officers and 163 men, the rest being among the first batch to be evacuated on 18 December. The remainder were divided in three groups. The first group, of three officers and ninety men, left the front for the embarkation beach at 17:30 the next day. They were followed by the second smaller group of three officers and forty-two men at 21:35. The last group, three officers and thirty-one men, had to cover for the whole regiment, keeping up a steady rate of fire and moving their one Maxim-gun around the position to support the deception that all defences were fully manned. This last group was also divided into three parts, the first of which left at 01:45 on 20 December. They were followed by the next group who waited ten minutes before withdrawing. The last small group of men left at 02:05, and reached the beach, without incident, at 03:30. The regiment sailed again to Lemnos, and on 22 December to Egypt, arriving at Alexandria on 26 December, and eventually returned to their old camp at Zeitoun.Powles 1928, pp.72‚Äì75 Sinai In Egypt reinforcements brought the regiment back up to full strength plus an added ten per cent, and the Machine-Gun Section was doubled in size from two to four guns. Another change was the appointment of Major James Whyte of the Wellington Mounted Rifles as commanding officer.Powles 1928, p.80 On 23 January 1916 the regiment left Zeitoun to take up a new defensive post on the Suez Canal to the east. While there, Findlay, having recovered from his wounds, returned as commanding officer on 19 February.Powles 1928, p.84 By 7 March the regiment was once more ready for operations and moved into the front line, at Railhead Ferrypost on the canal. Later that month, the brigade was assigned to the ANZAC Mounted Division.Gullet 1923, p.57 Katia Northern Sinai Desert Without any notice the regiment, and brigade, was ordered to Kantara, away on the Suez Canal, at 20:00 on 23 April. The reason was not then known by the troopers, but it later transpired that a Turkish force in the Sinai Desert had attacked British yeomanry positions at Katia and Oghratina.Powles 1928, pp.90‚Äì91 They reached Kantara at 07:00 and an hour later moved into the desert, camping at Hill 70 for the night. They sent reconnaissance patrols out into the desert, and manned observation posts. On 10 May the regiment was ordered to Romani and the next day to El Maler.Powles 1928, pp.92‚Äì93 Patrol activity was kept up, most of the time at troop strength, but sometimes involving the complete brigade.Powles 1928, p.95 On 15 May the regiment carried out a reconnaissance of Oghratina and Bir el Abd, and for the first time sighted a hostile force in the desert; they did not manage to engage them. The next day several men had to be evacuated, suffering from heat exhaustion, as temperatures reached . This convinced Findlay to cut their patrol short, and travelling overnight they arrived back at Maler early on 17 May.Powles 1928, pp.98‚Äì99 Over the next weeks their patrols continued, to acclimatise the men to desert travel and conditions.Powles 1928, pp.100‚Äì101 Early in July, the regiment lost its machine-gun section when it was transferred to form the brigade Machine-Gun Squadron. On 19 July reconnaissance aircraft spotted a large Turkish force moving west across the desert.Powles 1928, p.103 Romani Mount Royston, scene of the battle of Romani in 1916 Just after midnight on 4 August the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades were attacked at Romani. At 08:00, the regiment, acting as the brigade vanguard, advanced towards Dueidar; at the same time they could hear firing in the distance from Romani.Powles 1928, p.106 By 10:30 they were approaching the Turkish position on Mount Royston, and the regiment opened out to attack, with the 8th Squadron positioned on the left, the 1st in the centre, and the 10th on the right, with the Auckland Mounted Rifles following in support. The 5th Light Horse Regiment, who were supposed to be to the left of the 8th Squadron, had not yet arrived. The assault commenced at 15:00, supported by the Somerset Battery Royal Horse Artillery, and by 17:30 they had driven the Turks off Mount Royston. The brigade captured an artillery battery and over 1,000 prisoners.Powles 1928, p.107 The regiment's casualties during the battle were one dead and fifteen wounded. The next day at 03:30 they moved to Katia, which was believed to be occupied by a large Turkish force. On arrival, the brigade galloped forward, attacking from the south. When they got close the regiment dismounted and continued on foot. Fighting all day, they waited in vain for the 3rd Light Horse Brigade to support the assault. Still holding their ground at 20:00, they had to retire and return to Bir et Maler to water their horses.Powles 1928, pp.108‚Äì109 Their casualties were two dead and fifteen wounded. The Turkish force withdrew towards Katia, which by the time the regiment's reconnaissance patrol got there had been abandoned; the Turks were heading towards Oghratina. Once the enemy were located, the regiment kept patrols in contact with them overnight and all during the next day while the Turks withdrew to Negilia. By 8 August the enemy had reached Bir el Abd, where they established defences and were waiting for the New Zealanders.Powles 1928, pp.109‚Äì110 Abd Before dawn on 9 August the regiment was behind the Auckland Mounted Rifles heading towards Abd. The brigade was to attack head on, while the rest of the division circled around to attack the flanks. At 05:30 the Aucklands were engaged by the Turkish defenders, so the 8th Squadron was sent forward on their left to assist, and immediately came under fire. To support them the 1st and 10th Squadrons moved up on the left. The 8th Squadron advanced and captured a ridge line facing east, followed soon after by the other squadrons occupying the high ground to the west of Abd. From there they could see the Turkish defences, which consisted of trenches and redoubts, supported by artillery that kept up a steady rate of fire on the regiment. At 06:00 the Turks left their trenches to counter-attack the regiment, but were stopped by small arms fire and the attached Somerset Battery Royal Horse Artillery.Powles 1928, pp.110‚Äì112 The regiment then moved downhill towards Abd, but were faced with heavy Turkish artillery fire, which by 10:30 had stopped the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades to their left. At noon a second Turkish counter-attack came in waves towards the regiment's lines. They managed to fight them off, with heavy casualties. By 14:00 the Turks were attacking all the division's brigades in strength. The 1st and 2nd Light Horse in the north and the 3rd in the south began to retire, leaving the New Zealanders' position exposed on the flanks. Only by keeping up a heavy rate of small arms and artillery fire did they hold off the enemy. At 17:30, the divisional commander Harry Chauvel called off the attack and ordered a withdrawal, but as the New Zealanders were in danger of being overrun the withdrawal was postponed until dark, with the regiment forming a rearguard.Powles 1928, pp.112‚Äì114 The battle cost the regiment nine dead, twenty-two wounded and six men missing in action. The brigade withdrew to Debabis, caring for their wounded and resting for the next two days. On 12 August, they moved back to Abd, which had been evacuated by the Turks. Sending out reconnaissance patrols, they located the Turkish rearguard west of Salamana. Not being in a position to attack, they observed them until dusk, when the Turks moved further east to El Arish.Powles 1928, p.115 Magdhaba Crossing the Wadi el Arish in 1916 On 20 December, in response to reports that the Turks had evacuated El Arish, the regiment started moving overnight towards the village. Advance patrols discovered that the Turks had withdrawn along the Wadi el Arish to Magdhaba. By dawn 23 December the regiment reached the wadi and joined up with the rest of the division, now heading towards Magdhaba.Powles 1928, pp.122‚Äì124 By 05:00 they could see the Turkish position; the brigade was ordered to move around and approach it from the north. Five hours later the brigade had reached a position to start their attack, with the Canterbury regiment on the brigade's left.Powles 1928, p.124 Dismounted, the squadrons advanced in turn, covered by their machine-guns. At 15:00, when they were within of the Turkish lines, they were able to charge, with bayonets fixed, and captured the Turkish trench. One by one the Turkish redoubts were captured, before nightfall. The regiment's casualties were light, at two dead and eleven wounded. Rafa By the end of the year the Turkish forces had been pushed out of the Sinai, and in January 1917, orders were given for the division to attack Rafa on the Egyptian‚ÄìPalestine border. By dawn on 9 January, the regiment and division had reached the border, and the brigade manoeuvred to attack Rafa from the north-east.Powles 1928, pp.131‚Äì132 The 8th Squadron, leading the regiment, was moving around to the north of village, when the Turkish defenders opened fire on them. The regiment galloped forward, and one of their troops captured fifty prisoners at a police post. The remainder captured an uncompleted trench system, and another 171 prisoners, six of them German officers. The regiment was now position to block the Turkish withdrawal east, and were also able to observe the main Turkish defences.Powles 1928, pp.132‚Äì133 The regiment started advancing towards the village, the 8th Squadron on the left, and the 10th with the 1st Squadron on the right. Covered by their machine-guns, but under heavy Turkish fire, they gradually moved forward on foot. Troops took turns to run forward while the rest of the squadron covered them.Powles 1928, p.134 The intensity of the battle was demonstrated by the Inverness Battery Royal Horse Artillery, which was supporting the brigade and ran out of ammunition at 14:00. Two hours later the division's covering force reported Turkish reinforcements approaching, and Lieutenant-General Philip Chetwode, who was commanding the attack, decided to call it off. Almost simultaneously Edward Chaytor, commanding the brigade, ordered another attack. Covered by their machine-guns the men carried out a bayonet charge and the Turks to their front surrendered. By this time the other brigades had started to withdraw, but seeing what had happened, they turned back and also charge, capturing the position. The battle cost the regiment six dead and nineteen wounded. Palestine British Palestine operations in 1917, Gaza and Beersheba at the bottom, Jaffa, Jerusalem and Jericho at the top Gaza The British plan for Gaza required the ANZAC Mounted Division to circle around by night and block Turkish reinforcements getting to the town. On 26 March at 02:30, the brigade left camp in a heavy fog and crossed the Wadi Ghuzze south-east of Gaza. They soon reached their positions with the brigade, between the 2nd Light Horse and 22nd Mounted Brigades, and waited for the infantry divisions to assault the town. At 14:00, as the infantry were having problems, the brigade were ordered to attack.Powles 1928, pp.146‚Äì147 The regiment galloped towards the town, with the Wellington Mounted Rifles on their right and the Auckland Mounted Rifles in reserve. Once there, the regiment moved south along a ridge and attacked the garrison at Ali Muntar. This hilltop could command the approaches into Gaza. They soon captured the outlying Turkish trenches, forcing the defenders back towards the town. At 18:40 the 10th Squadron reached the hill top at the same time as the 53rd (Welsh) Division, who had been trying all day to take the position from the other side.Powles 1928, p.148 Despite having captured a commanding position, both the regiment and the infantry division were ordered to withdraw. Turkish reinforcements had been reported en route, and the overall commander did not believe they could hold what they had captured. The regiment retired back the way they had come, and reached Belah just after midnight the next day. Casualties for the day were one dead and six wounded. Regimental Headquarters after the First Battle of Gaza Wadi Ghuzee line On 3 April the squadrons were issued Hotchkiss machine-guns, one per troop.Nicol 1921, p.140 After the British withdrawal, the Turks built a defensive line of trenches and redoubts, from the sea south of Gaza to Beersheba, following the route of the road. The British plan for the second attack involved the ANZAC Mounted Division providing flank protection, intercepting any reinforcements, and pursuing the retreating Turkish forces if required.Nicol 1921, p.142 The regiment moved out at 18:30 on 16 April, forming the vanguard for the division. At 04:30 the next morning the 10th Squadron, in the lead, crossed the Wadi Ghuzee at Shellal. Their only opposition came from enemy aircraft which bombed the division. Breaking out into an extended line, they reconnoitred towards Sharia and Beersheba, reporting on Turkish movements. At nightfall they withdrew back to Shellal.Powles 1928, p.151 The next day was a repeat of the previous day.Powles 1928, p.152 Then, after dark, the division was ordered to march overnight to support the Imperial Mounted Division. The regiment set out at 23:00, and by 09:00 on 18 April were the brigade reserve for their assault on \\"Sausage Ridge\\". At 14:30 the regiment was called upon, and galloped forward under an artillery bombardment. Dismounting, a machine-gun section set up just in time to stop a Turkish counter-attack.Powles 1028, p.154 However, the British attack all along the line had faltered and was called off that night, and they withdrew back behind the Wadi Ghuzee.Nicol 1921, p.145 The three days of fighting cost the regiment three dead and twenty-eight wounded. Beersheba The attack on Tel el Saba The regiment's involvement in the attack on Beersheba began at 18:00 on 30 October, when the ANZAC Mounted Division set off along the Wadi el Imshash towards the village. By 08:00 the brigade had reached its starting position at Bir Salim Irgeig, ready to begin their assault on Tel el Saba. Moving around the open Turkish flank they managed to approach the mound from the east. The regiment were to the right of the brigade line with the Auckland Mounted Rifles on their left. The regiment intended to move around and outflank the Turkish position from the north.Powles 1928, p.169 Once the assault started they slowly moved up the hill, and eventually they passed the Wadi Khalil and were able to engage the rear of the Turkish position. Confronted by Turkish artillery and machine-gun fire coming from their north, they could advance no further. At 15:00 the Aucklanders managed to charge and capture the hill top.Powles 1928, p.170 Elsewhere, Beersheba was captured following a mounted charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade.Wilkie 1924, p.162 The regiment's casualties during the battle were one dead and six wounded. Khuweilfe The next day, 1 November, the brigade moved north-east following the withdrawing Turks. The regiment, forming the vanguard, came under machine-gun fire so the 10th Squadron charged directly at the position while the 1st Squadron moved around and attacked from the flank. The position was quickly captured with thirteen prisoners and a machine-gun taken. That night, they returned to Beersheba for water. Following two days of rest, they moved out on 4 November, to relieve the 5th Mounted Brigade in the Ras el Nagb mountains.Wilkie 1924, p.170 Turkish artillery fired on them en route, wounding five men. Once in position, they were attacked at 03:00 the next morning by a small Turkish force, which was forced to retire. Then a Turkish cavalry force was sighted assembling in a valley, which the regiment opened fire on; they galloped away. At 11:00 the Turkish returned to the attack, supported by artillery and machine-gun fire, and managed to get to within of the regiment's lines before being stopped. Turkish artillery continued to bombard the regiment for the rest of the day, only stopping after dark.Wilkie 1924, p.171 The day's fighting cost the regiment six dead and forty-nine wounded. As there was no trace of their relief, and the horses had not been watered for forty-eight hours, they were sent back to Beersheba. Eventually relieved, on 6 November, by the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, the men set out to the rear on foot, meeting their returning horses at Kh el Ras. Ayun Kara Battle of Ayun Kara On 11 November, the brigade was ordered to move to the western flank and rejoin the division. It was not an easy task due to the difficult terrain, and one stage of took them thirty hours to cross. They eventually met with the division at Hamame the next day and had to rest and recuperate until moving out again on 13 November and camping for the night at Yebna.Powles 1928, pp.174‚Äì175 The next morning, 14 November, the regiment crossed the River Rubin, and at 12:30 located a Turkish position at Ayun Kara.Powles 1928, p.175 The regiment was on the left front of the brigade advance, with the Wellington Mounted Rifles on their left and the Aucklanders in reserve. As the regiment advanced through orange groves, they were engaged by the Turkish defenders. The regiment then held a fire support position while the other two regiments attacked on the left. Fighting off several counter-attacks the brigade eventually, at nightfall, won the battle and held their ground overnight.Powles 1928, p.176 Not being involved in the main assault, the regiment's casualties were rather light at one dead and six wounded. The next day the Turkish force had withdrawn, and the regiment advanced first to Beit Dejan, and then occupied the port of Jaffa on 17 November, where the commanding officer established the regimental headquarters in the German Consulate. River Auja Around to the north of Jaffa is the River Auja, along which the withdrawing Turkish Fourth Army had formed a defence line. The only crossing points were a bridge at Khurbet Hadrah, and three fords. One of these was about to the east of Hadrah, another was at Jerisheh and the third at the river mouth.Nicol 1921, pp.168‚Äì171 The brigade was ordered to assault the river and capture a crossing. On 24 November the regiment, with the 8th Squadron leading, crossed the ford at the river mouth. Taken by surprise, the Turkish defenders retired, and were followed by the regiment, who galloped into the nearby foothills and captured the village of Sheikh Muannis. The rest of the brigade continued the attack along the river, capturing the other crossings. To support their defence, the 161st (Essex) Brigade moved to the north of the river and dug in. The regiment sent mounted patrols forward to observe the surrounding country.Powles 1928, pp.177‚Äì178 The next day the Turkish counter-attacked the bridge-head at Khurbet Hadrah in force. Their first attempt failed, but after being reinforced they tried again the same day. Eventually the Essex Brigade were forced to withdraw back across the river. The regiment, to assist them, crossed at the river mouth and attacked the Turkish right, with the 10th Squadron heading, on foot, for Sheikh Muannis to assist the Wellington Mounted Rifles. Now defended by the 10th Squadron, the village's defenders withdrew across the river, and once clear they were followed by the squadron. Meanwhile, the 1st and 8th Squadrons, which had moved into the northern hills, were heavily attacked by the advancing Turks. They managed to hold a line, supported by their machine- guns, as they slowly retired, troop covering troop, back to the river. The Turkish force, now back in control of the northern river bank, made no attempt to force a crossing.Powles 1928, pp.180‚Äì181 Despite the nature of the battle, with the regiment withdrawing in daylight, their casualties were again rather light at two dead and four wounded. Jordan Valley=Jericho The British captured Jerusalem in December, but the Turkish forces still held the Jordan Valley and the area around the Dead Sea, putting the British right flank in danger of a counter-attack. As a result, the regiment's next operation involved the capture of Jericho in the east.Powles 1928, p.192 River Jordan during the First World War On 16 February the regiment started their move towards Bethlehem, arriving there the next day. Two days later the brigade started over the hills towards the River Jordan, marching overnight. The tracks forced them into single file, but by daylight they were at El Muntar. From there the terrain dropped to the Jordan Valley. As soon as the brigade's vanguard appeared they were engaged by the Turkish defences. It was not until 07:00 that the regiment came into the open to assist the attack.Powles 1928, pp.192‚Äì194 The regiment was sent against a Turkish strong point at Hill 288, the 8th and 10th Squadrons leading with the 1st in reserve. The 10th Squadron had problems continuing their attack so the 1st was sent forward by a different route, and by noon the Turkish defenders were withdrawing to Nebi Musa. Here, using their artillery and machine-guns, the Turks held up the regiment's advance along a narrow defile until nightfall. The next morning the 10th Squadron were sent forward again, but the Turks had withdrawn during the night.Powles 1928, p.195 At 05:30 on 21 February the regiment formed the brigade's vanguard as it started out again, reaching the Jordan Valley at 09:00. The regiment pushed ahead towards Jericho, leaving the 8th Squadron behind to repair the road they were using. Jericho was occupied by the 1st Light Horse Brigade, so the regiment deployed along the River Jordan, from the Dead Sea to a pontoon bridge at Ghoraniyeh, which was still held by the Turks.Powles 1928, p.196 The next day was spent patrolling the vicinity of the river, and at 15:00 on 22 February the western side was declared clear of all Turkish forces. The brigade did not linger in the valley, and at 18:00 the same day they started back to Jerusalem.Powles 1928, p.199 Amman A raid on Amman was the next operation for the regiment. The ANZAC Mounted Division, 60th (London) Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade would all take part.Nicol 1921, p.189 On 13 March the regiment started back to the Jordan Valley through heavy rain. Orders for the raid were issued; the brigade would advance on mountain tracks, via the village of Ain Es Sir, then to Amman.Wilkie 1924, pp.189‚Äì190 The rains postponed the raid, and it was not until 01:30 on 24 March that the brigade crossed the river Jordan, by a pontoon bridge at Hajlah. At 09:30 the regiment, the Wellington Mounted Rifles and the 181st (2/6th London) Brigade started clearing the area between the river and the foothills.Wilkie 1924, p.193 The vanguard, formed by the 1st Squadron and the Auckland Mounted Rifles, had by 16:30 left the Wadi Jeria and started up into the hills.Powles 1928, p.204 In the wet and cold weather progress was slow. The narrow tracks meant that all wheeled transport, including artillery and supply wagons, had to be left behind.Powles 1928, p.205 They reached Ain Es Sir at 14:00, two hours behind the vanguard. Out of contact with the division, they remained at the village for the remainder of that day and the next. Patrols checked the area between the village and Amman, which was around away. The remainder of the division, which had travelled by a different route, arrived later that day. They were in no physical condition to attack, so the advance was postponed until the next day.Powles 1928, p.206 The Amman raid The assault began at daylight on 27 March; the 8th Squadron moved across the plain to Kusr, where their progress was stopped by heavy Turkish small arms fire. The squadron formed a defensive line, while the 1st Squadron moved past them on the right and captured a small hill.Powles 1928, p.208 Turkish artillery and machine-gun fire grew heavier all day, and another attempt by the 8th Squadron to move forward at 16:00 also failed. At 19:25 the Turks counter-attacked the 1st Squadron, but were forced to retire. That night patrols were sent to reconnoitre the Turkish positions, so they could be more easily attacked the next day. At dawn on 28 March the entire division tried another attack. The 1st Squadron managed to capture a small trench, but without their artillery support they were unable to move any further forward in the face of heavy Turkish machine-gun fire. All that day and night they managed to hold onto what they had won, waiting for reinforcement to continue the attack.Powles 1928, pp.208‚Äì209 The next day it was decided to make a dismounted attack on Hill 3039, outside Amman. The regiment, while still holding its own lines, provided eleven officers and 102 other ranks to take part in the assault. At 02:00 they formed up and started forward, the regiment's contingent forming the second line with the Wellington Mounted Rifles. The assault was successful, the first line capturing their objectives.Powles 1928, p.210 The second line passed through them onto their objectives. With around to go, Turkish machine-guns opened fire on them, but they pressed on, capturing a machine-gun and fourteen prisoners. Then the 8th Squadron moved forward with the 4th (ANZAC) Battalion, Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, and captured the last Turkish position on the hill. The brigade settled in to defend the hill, the regiment located between the brigade's other two units. At dawn Turkish artillery targeted the hill, and at 09:30 the Turks counter-attacked the New Zealanders. They were stopped by the brigade, using captured machine-guns in addition to their own weapons.Powles 1928, p.211 Turkish artillery continued to bombard the hill until 16:00, when another counter-attack began, mostly to the regiment's left; this was driven off. The third counter-attack came an hour later but was also defeated. Elsewhere the rest of the division had been trying to reach Amman but could not make any progress. Unable to continue the attack, and with a shortage of ammunition and rations, the division was ordered to withdraw back to the River Jordan.Wilkie 1924, p.213 The brigade was ordered at 18:00 to retire back to Ain Es Sir. On arrival the 1st Squadron formed a defensive line, while the rest of the regiment rested. However, the 1st Squadron were soon engaged by a Turkish force, and the regiment and the Auckland Mounted Rifles moved up to support them. For the remainder of the night, the division retired through the line held by the regiment, until 04:00 on 1 April when the Wellington Mounted Rifles took over from the regiment, which then followed the division back to the river. They reached the Jordan Valley at dusk and moved back across the river.Powles 1928, pp.214‚Äì215 During the operation, the regiment lost eighteen dead, thirty-seven wounded and one man missing in action. The brigade crossed the Jordan and the regiment camped to the south-east of Jericho. Not all of the ANZAC Mounted Division moved west of the river; the 1st Light Horse Brigade remained on the eastern bank forming a bridge-head. On 19 April the regiment crossed back over the river to conduct a reconnaissance of Shunet Nimrin. Advancing through Turkish artillery fire they got to within of the Turkish lines in the foothills, and remained there all day, before returning to the western bank at 21:00.Powles 1928, pp.219‚Äì221 Es Salt Crossing the River Jordan On 30 April the second raid across the Jordan began, their objective to capture Es Salt. This time a much larger force was involved under command of the Desert Mounted Corps. The regiment and brigade were part of the force assigned to attack Shunet Nimrin.Wilkie 1924, p.210 Once again they advanced through Turkish artillery fire, and confronted by Turkish strong points in the foothills, were unable to make any progress. That night they moved back across the Jordan, having suffered three dead and eleven wounded.Powles 1928, p.221 On 1 May the brigade became the corps reserve and at noon were ordered to assist the 179th (2/4th London) Brigade in their attack on El Haud. The regiment crossed the bridge and started forward, through artillery fire, first walking then increasing their pace to a canter, until they reached cover. But then they were ordered back and had to return to Umm Es Shert, so they headed back through the shellfire until they reached the village. They remained there overnight until ordered forward to support the 4th Light Horse Brigade defending the road from the Ed Damieh ford to Es Salt, which was the only route back for the rest of the force attacking Es Salt.Powles 1928, pp.221‚Äì222 For the next day the regiment held a defensive position along the road, and then moved, dismounted, into the mountains to help the Australian Mounted Division extricate themselves. On 3 May, once the Australians had moved past them, the regiment walked back down the track behind them, shelled by Turkish artillery. They then moved into the lines held by the infantry until the other forces had reached safety, before forming the rearguard back to Ghoraniyeh, arriving at 16:00 on 5 May.Powles 1928, p.223 Chaytor's Force The next months were spent training and refitting, until August when the brigade formed the divisional reserve located around Jericho. In September they moved forward to form the left (northern) flank of the Jordan Valley defences. At the same time, the regiment took command of the 1st and 2nd Battalions British West Indies Regiment and the 38th and 39th Battalions Royal Fusiliers, which were part of a larger deception force commanded by the divisional commander, Chaytor.Wilkie 1924, p.218 They were tasked with convincing the Turks that the next British attack would be from the Jordan Valley, while the forces were actually being realigned to attack in the west. The regiment was heavily involved in the deception, carrying out offensive patrolling, constructing dummy camps, and moving back and forwards behind the lines to give the impression of a much larger force than was actually present.Wilkie 1924, p.219 The main British attack started in the west on 19 September; the regiment remained in the Jordan Valley keeping patrols close to the Turkish positions to watch for any withdrawal. The first evidence of that was observed the next day, when the Turks retired from their forward positions. The regiment then moved to join the rest of the brigade at Khubret Fusail on the western bank of the Jordan.Powles 1928, pp.222‚Äì223 The Damieh bridge The next day the brigade started towards their first objective, the bridge at Damieh. At 10:30 the Auckland Mounted Rifles, assisted by the 1st Squadron, assaulted and captured the Damieh bridge with a bayonet charge.Powles 1928, p.233 The 10th Squadron arrived after the bridge was secured, and followed the Aucklanders pursuing the withdrawing Turks into the hills. That night the regiment moved back across the bridge, leaving the 1st Squadron behind to guard it. The next day the brigade was ordered to resume the advance, so with the regiment as the vanguard, overcame the first obstacle, a Turkish machine-gun post. At 15:30 they reached Es Salt, passed through the town to the east, and formed a defensive position in the hills for the night. During the day they had captured 250 men, three artillery pieces and several machine-guns.Powles 1928, p.234 The next day, 24 September, the regiment continued their advance, heading towards Suweile where they were joined by the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades.Powles 1928, pp.234‚Äì235 The next day about north-west of Amman they came upon two Turkish redoubts covering the road to the town. While the brigade's other regiments deployed to attack them, the regiment, with a section from the Machine-Gun Squadron, were ordered to manoeuvre around to assault them from the rear. At midday they were confronted by around two hundred Turkish troops defending a ridge line. The regiment, through artillery and machine-gun fire, assaulted and captured the ridge. Not stopping to consolidate the position, they continued forward towards Amman. Once there the 10th Squadron, and part of the 8th Squadron, assaulted the Citadel in a bayonet charge, capturing 119 German prisoners and six machine-guns.Powles 1928, pp.235‚Äì236 The regiment then charged through the town, capturing the railway station at 16:30. All told the regiment took 1,200 prisoners, fourteen machine-guns, and other military stores.Powles 1928, p.237 Their own casualties were one dead and two wounded. Casualties and illness had reduced the regiment's strength to only 350 men, many of whom were struck down with malaria. The regiment remained in the Amman area until the night of 29/30 September when they moved south to Kastel and secured a large number of prisoners from the Turkish II Corps. On 3 October they were relieved by the 3rd Light Horse Regiment, and started back towards the Jordan Valley.Powles 1928, p.238 By 9 October they had crossed the valley and had reached Jerusalem; they then went back to Ayun Kara, their part in the war being over.Powles 1928, p.239 Post war Men of the Canterbury Mounted Rifles sitting on a Turkish 14-inch gun at Kilid Bahr The war in the Middle East ended on 31 October 1918, following the signing of the Armistice of Moudros.Waite 1919, p.295 In November the regiment was selected to be part of the Allied force of occupation for the Dardanelles peninsula.Waite 1919, p.298 They would again be going in a dismounted role, but only twenty-five officers and 464 other ranks were involved. Leaving Egypt on 28 November they disembarked on 5 December and moved into their camps at Maidos and Kilid Bahr.Powles 1928, p.245 On 19 January 1919, the majority of the regiment returned to Egypt, rejoining the brigade at Kantara.Powles 1928, p.247 On 17 March the whole brigade was ordered to deploy to assist the civil authorities dealing with growing unrest among the Egyptian civilian population. The regiment moved to the Nile Delta on 23 March, forming a column with four armoured cars and an armoured train.Powles 1928, p.248 Any one found rioting was arrested and tried in front of a court headed by the commanding-officer, who also imposed sentences. Within weeks the rioting was quelled and the regiment returned to their camp, remaining there until 17 June when they were ordered to send their horses to the remount depot and move to Ismailia on the Suez Canal. On 30 June they embarked on the transport ship HMNZT Ulimaroa for New Zealand and the regiment was disbanded. Casualties During the war 334 men from the regiment died from all causes. In the seven months of the Gallipoli Campaign they had 127 dead; fourteen of those died of illness and 113 were killed in action. Another forty-six, not included in that total, were reported missing believed dead. The two years of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign accounted for another 127 dead. At the same time 466 men were debilitated or wounded in action at Gallipoli, and another 254 were wounded during the later campaign, a total of 720 wounded for both campaigns. Many of the Gallipoli dead have no known grave; the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Chunuk Bair Cemetery, constructed on the site where the Turks buried Allied war dead following the evacuation, has 632 graves of which only ten men have been identified. At the nearby Hill 60 Cemetery, which has another 788 graves, only seventy-six were identified. Honours Several men of the regiment were recognised for their service by the British Empire awards system. Captain Robin Harper, later commander of the brigade machine-gun squadron, was perhaps the most decorated, being awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), Military Cross (MC), Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) and being mentioned in despatches three times. Findlay was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath and awarded a DSO, alongside six other officers who were also invested with the DSO. One officer was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, and another a Member of the Order of the British Empire. Another eleven officers were awarded the MC, while the other ranks received a total of twelve DCMs and twenty-three Military Medals. There were also a total of sixty mentions in despatches, some men being mentioned more than once.Powles 1928, pp.253‚Äì264 References ;Footnotes ;Citations ;Bibliography    * Category:New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade Category:Military units and formations established in 1914 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1919 Category:Mounted infantry regiments of New Zealand in World War I Category:History of Canterbury, New Zealand Category:1914 establishments in New Zealand ","title":"Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment"},{"id":"18675380","text":"Il vedovo allegro is a 1950 Italian romance film directed by Mario Mattoli and starring Carlo Dapporto.

Life Mezger was born at Eichst√§dt. He took vows at the same time as his brother Francis Mezger in 1651, and was ordained priest in 1659. He taught poetry in the gymnasium of Salzburg in 1660, and was master of novices and sub-prior in his monastery in 1661. He then taught philosophy at the University of Salzburg, 1662-4; apologetics and polemics, 1665-7; and canon law, 1668-73. He was prior of his monastery and taught hermeneutics and polemics, 1673-8, when he was appointed vice- chancellor of the university. He died at the monastery of St. Gall, while on a pilgrimage to Einsiedeln. He was an intimate friend of Mabillon with whom he kept up a constant correspondence and who in his \\"Iter Germanicum\\" calls him \\"Universitatis Salisburgensis pr√¶cipuum ornamentum\\" (Vetera Analecta, I, xi). Works His major work is \\"Historia Salisburgensis\\" covering the period from 582 to 1687, of which work he, however, had written only the first four books (582-1555) when he died, leaving the remainder to be completed by his brothers, Francis and Paul Mezger.

Early life and career Pritikin was born to Theodosia Burr Sherrard, and jazz musician, Arnold \\"Arnie\\" Pritikin Russian Jewish heritage, in Chicago, Illinois. As he says, he was ¬´raised in Chicago and lowered in Los Angeles¬ª. As an ad agency copywriter in New York, he was hired to work on the Maverick television series and moved to San Francisco. He became an executive at Young & Rubicam, then formed his own ad agency, Pritikin & Gibbons. In the early 1960s, Bob was the Creative Director of Fletcher, Richards, Calkins & Holden (FRC&H;) Advertising Agency in San Francisco, responsible among other things for landmark Folgers Coffee television commercials for which he was the voice in the ads for many years. In 1964, FRC&H; was bought by Campbell-Ewald Advertising, the Detroit advertising agency for Chevrolet. Bob remained the creative director of the agency. San Francisco author Armistead Maupin credits Pritikin's turning him down for a job as being responsible for Maupin's writing Tales of the City Hotelier In 1977 Pritikin opened the \\"Mansion Hotel\\", a bed and breakfast in Pacific Heights, where he would entertain guests with magic shows and musical performances. The hotel, consisting of two Queen Anne mansions connected by a hallway, was decorated eclectically with caged and uncaged birds (including a Macaw sometimes said to be the reincarnation of the house's original owner), pig memorabilia, life-sized stuffed dolls of Bill and Hillary Clinton, Richard Nixon's letter of resignation as United States President and Gerald Ford's letter of pardon, fresh flowers and candy in every room, a central music system that always played classical music, and a player piano that was supposedly played by \\"Claudia\\", a ghost. The hotel had a collection of sculptures in its yard. Pritikin opened the hotel on election days as a local polling station, encouraging voters with music, an ice sculpture in the shape of an eagle, layer cake and caviar. In 2000 he sold the hotel, by then designated a city landmark, as private housing. Chenery Mansion In 1981 Pritikin built a mansion for himself in the quiet residential neighborhood of Glen Park, San Francisco. The building, also known as \\"Chenery House\\", is the largest private property in the city, featuring a swimming pool inside a second story living room.http://adage.com/article/agency-news/peek-inside- adman-pritikin-s-kitschy-san-fran-mansion/241089/ The house was used for a period as a rental event center. Pritikin was notorious for throwing eccentric parties at the house, including political fundraisers, an annual Labor Day party for 850 people, and a yearly passover seder. His concluding \\"Last Supper Passover\\" was held as a fundraiser for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society co- hosted by nominee 2008 Woman of the Year, Daphne Evans, a cancer survivor and founder of Heaven's Door Oncology, a cancer foundation. Pritkin is an avid classical musical saw performer, considered one of the world's greatest, often hosting performances. Frequent performers, other than Pritikin himself, have included Bob Weir and Ratdog, Carol Channing, and Tammy Faye Messner. Other guests over the years have ranged from Mickey Rooney to Liberace. In one event he bussed thirty guests to San Jose for dinner at the Wendy's that was the site of the infamous chili finger incident. Pritikin is a collector of many things. His art collection is said to be worth at least $40 million. In 2007 he paid $100,000 for one of Hitler's Globes‚Äîa world globe that Adolf Hitler had used to plan submarine warfare from his Eagle's Nest compound in the Bavarian Alps, and was taken to California by an American soldier in 1945. In an interview, he claimed it would make a good counterpart to his Benny Bufano sculptures, which celebrated world peace. A replica of the globe was prominently featured in Valkyrie, the thriller about a real-life plot to assassinate Hitler, leading Pritikin to complain that it had been done without his permission. In 2004 Pritikin offered to bequeath the mansion to the City of San Francisco for use as an official mayoral residence, but the city rejected his plans. In 2009 he announced plans to operate his home as a museum. It opened as the private, not-for-profit Pritikini Museum. Books published * an autobiography \\"He thinks big, spends small.

It is based on the Aprilia RSV Mille. Its successor, the Aprilia RSV1000R superbike shares its engine, gearbox, frame and, partly, its suspension. The Tuono was succeeded by the Aprilia Tuono V4 R for model year 2011, though the V2 model continued in production into the 2011 model year.  Design  The current Aprilia Tuono is designed as a streetfighter with a lot of electronic aids such as multi level traction control, ABS, Wheelie control, launch control and AQS(Aprilia Quick Shift electronic System). Since 2002, a lot of changes have been made but the basics character of the bike almost remains almost the same. 2002 Aprilia Tuono R Limited Following the 2001 Bologna Motor Show, the Aprilia Tuono made its debut in a series of 220 individually numbered bikes. Called the Tuono R Limited and in hindsight being a proof of concept for the future RSV Tuono Factory, it had the engine of the RSV Mille R, a gold colored frame and was built solely out of high end materials such as carbon fiber, kevlar and titanium. Specs included √ñhlins Racing suspension, OZ forged alloy wheels, Brembo 4-pad brake calipers and an Aprilia Racing titanium exhaust system with matching EEPROM. 2002 - 2005 RSV Tuono (known as the Tuono Fighter for 2003 in the US market) The roots of the RSV Tuono lie with the 1998 - 2003 RSV Mille superbike. The original 2003-2005 RSV Tuono uses the 2002 Mille frame, engine, suspension and brakes. The majority of parts are interchangeable between Mille and Tuono models up until the introduction of the RSV 1000 R which replaced the Mille. One minor difference is that the RSV Tuono is fitted with a steering damper as standard whereas the RSV Mille is not. The reason for this is to avoid potential speed wobble under full acceleration due to the motocross style handlebars atop high machined ergal risers causing the rider to sit more upright, resulting in less weight over the front wheel. The main difference is the lack of significant bodywork (fairings). The base model Tuono (known as the Tuono Fighter in the US market for 2003 and as the RSV Tuono for the 2004-2005 models) and the high spec Tuono Factory all share the same frame-mounted bikini fairing and body covers, either in plastic for the base model or carbon fibre for the Factory models. The frame and swingarm of the 2003 Tuono (Tuono Fighter in the US market) was a light bronze color, whereas the 2004 and 2005 models sported a black frame and swingarm. This contrasted with the frames used on the RSV Mille which were a chrome finish for the base models and black for the Racing/Factory models. The Tuono base models feature an adjustable Sachs rear shock absorber and Showa front suspension. The RSV Tuono uses the Austrian built BRP-Rotax V990 60¬∞ V-Twin engine which can also be found in numerous other Aprilia models. It sports dual overhead cams, double balance shafts, 4 valves per cylinder, electronic fuel injection, twin spark ignition and the same two-into-one exhaust as used on the RSV Mille. In the RSV Tuono, the V990 delivers @ 9500 rpm and @ 7250 rpm. Its fuel tank will hold 18 L (4.8 gal) and has a maximum range of 280 km (175 mi) on the highway before the low fuel indicator turns on. Fuel consumption increases significantly with aggressive throttle use. 2003 - 2005 RSV Tuono Factory The RSV Tuono Factory is a high spec model based upon the Aprilia RSV Mille R. Compared to the standard RSV Tuono it has forged alloy wheels, gold anodized √ñhlins Racing front forks, fully adjustable √ñhlins Racing rear monoshock, a fully adjustable √ñhlins Racing steering damper, radially mounted Brembo brake calipers and it extensively uses carbon fiber parts for weight reduction. 2006 - 2010 Tuono 1000 R The 2nd generation Tuono, the Tuono 1000 R, is based upon the 2004 - 2009 Aprilia RSV1000R superbike. One technical difference between the Tuono 1000 R and the RSV1000R is that the latter has a rear shock providing control of both compression and rebound damping, as well as preload control. The Tuono 1000 R only provides control of preload and rebound damping. This directly implies that the stock Tuono is less usable as a track bike when compared to the Mille. However, since the parts between the two are interchangeable and abundant this should not hinder anyone wanting to use the Tuono as a track bike from changing the rear shock. Other differences are purely cosmetic and consist of the lack of a full fairing, a superbike handlebar instead of clip- ons and different paint schemes. Like the first generation Tuono, the Tuono 1000 R also employs a steering damper as standard. The BRP-Rotax V990 60¬∞ V-Twin engine was upgraded significantly when compared to the first generation Tuono: different gear ratios (close ratio with longer first gear), larger throttle bodies, single spark plug, minor cosmetic changes and an increase in power output to @ 9500 rpm. Torque increased to @ 8500 rpm. The 2006 - 2010 Aprilia Tuono is offered in two versions: the Tuono 1000 R is the standard version, based upon the Aprilia RSV1000R. The Tuono 1000 R Factory is Aprilia's flagship naked bike. 2006 - 2010 Tuono 1000 R Factory Early 2008 Aprilia Tuono 1000 R Factory The Tuono 1000 R Factory comes with fully adjustable √ñhlins Racing rear mono-shock and front forks, blue- or gold- anodized (depending on model year) forged aluminum wheels, a frame finished in gold, a paint job sporting the signature Aprilia Lion's head on the fuel tank and the extensive use of carbon fiber parts. The use of forged aluminum wheels and carbon fiber explains the weight difference of between the two versions in favor of the Factory model. 2012 - Tuono V4 APRC For the 2012 model year, the Tuono was completely redesigned along the lines of the RSV4 with a 1000cc 65¬∞ V4. As with that bike, it received Aprilia's APRC (Aprilia Performance Ride Control) package with 8-position traction control, 3 position wheelie control, and 3 position launch control. For the 2014 model year, various refinements including a larger 18.5 l fuel tank, more comfortable saddle, and 3 position race ABS brakes were introduced. It produced 153.6 horsepower and 77.1 foot pounds of torque at the rear wheel in dyno testing. It was generally well received with one complaint centering on driveline lash due to the use of a slipper clutch. 2015 - Tuono V4 1100 For the 2015 model year, the Tuono was updated with increasing the engine size to . Now called the Aprilia Tuono V4 1100 RR and √ñhlins-equipped Factory model with a claimed @ 11,000 rpm and a wet weight of . Tuono comes with three levels of adjustable Cornering ABS system developed in collaboration with Bosch, plus three new engine maps‚ÄîSport, Track, and Race. The new 2017 Tuonos are outfitted with Aprilia‚Äôs new TFT display and produces @ 11,000 rpm (claimed). The Tuonos were also available in the factory paint scheme similar to that on the Aprilia RS V4.

It was assigned to the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, part of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. The regiment, with an establishment of twenty-six officers, 523 other ranks and 600 horses, was formed from three squadrons belonging to pre war Territorial Force regiments; the Queen Alexandra's 2nd (Wellington West Coast) Mounted Rifles, the 6th (Manawatu) Mounted Rifles and the 9th (Wellington East Coast) Mounted Rifles. It also included a small headquarters and, until 1916, a Maxim machine-gun section. The Maxim guns were withdrawn but the regiment's fire-power increased during the war, by the end of which each squadron had four Hotchkiss machine-guns, one per troop. As mounted infantry, the regiment rode into battle on their horses, but were expected to dismount for battle, and then fight on foot. The regiment fought predominantly against the forces of the Ottoman Turkish Empire. In the Gallipoli Campaign between May and December 1915, they participated in the largest battle of that theatre at Chunuk Bair, and also in the fighting for Hill 60. Evacuated to Egypt, they then took part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign from 1916 to 1918. The early battles there included those at Romani, Gaza and Beersheba. Later in the war they were part of the force that occupied the Jordan Valley, and took part in the raid on Amman and the raid on Es Salt. Their final war time operation was in connection with the capture of the Turkish Fourth Army. During the four years of war the regiment had 369 dead and 453 wounded, several of those wounded more than once. After the war, the regiment played a minor role in the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, before being disbanded in June 1919. History=Formation 2nd Squadron Badge, Regiment Hat-Band, 6th Squadron Badge, 9th Squadron Badge Raised on 8 August 1914 at the start of the First World War, the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment came from the region around Wellington on the North Island of New Zealand. It was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel William Meldrum,Wilkie 1924, p.3 and comprised a headquarters, a machine-gun section, and three squadrons formed from Territorial Force regiments. The New Zealand Territorial Force included a compulsory training system, and the four Military Districts were each required to supply a mounted regiment for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. To meet that obligation the Territorial Force regiments each provided a squadron, which kept their own regimental badges and traditions.Waite 1919, p.6 The regiment's squadrons came from the Queen Alexandra's 2nd (Wellington West Coast) Mounted Rifles (2nd Squadron), the 6th (Manawatu) Mounted Rifles (6th Squadron) and the 9th (Wellington East Coast) Mounted Rifles (9th Squadron).Powles 1922, p.3 The establishment was fixed at twenty-six officers and 523 other ranks, who used 528 riding horses, seventy- four draught horses and six pack horses. Each squadron, of 158 men, had a field headquarters and four troops. The Machine-Gun Section, with two Maxim Guns, had one officer, twenty-six other ranks, twenty riding horses and sixteen draught horses. Although the regiment used horses, they were not cavalry but mounted infantry, and expected to ride to the battlefield, dismount and then fight as traditional infantry.Stack 2011, p.1883 Attached to, but not part of, the regiment were medical and veterinary officers, an artificer, three more other ranks and another eighteen horses. The regiment was assigned to the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, serving alongside two other regiments, the Auckland Mounted Rifles and the Canterbury Mounted Rifles.Kinloch 2005, p.4Gullet 1923, p.58 Embarkation The regiment conducted training until 24 September, when they received embarkation orders. Due to the fear of German warships being in the area, the wait for suitable escort ships delayed their departure until 15 October.Wilkie 1924, pp.3‚Äì7 With a short stop at Hobart, on 28 October they arrived at Albany, and anchored waiting to be joined by the Australian contingent. The combined convoy sailed on 1 November and reached Colombo on 15 November. Two days later it sailed into the Red Sea and the Suez Canal.Wilkie 1924, pp.8‚Äì9 They docked at Port Said on 2 December and Alexandria the next day. The regiment disembarked on 4 December and boarded a train for their camp in the Cairo suburb of Zeitoun. There they started a training programme, using the desert for manoeuvres, during both day and night.Wilkie 1924, p.11 In April 1915 the New Zealand and Australian forces, except the mounted troops, were sent to serve in the Gallipoli Campaign. Heavy casualties during the landings provided a need for reinforcements, so the regiment and other mounted troops, without their horses, were ordered to Gallipoli.Wilkie 1924, pp.12‚Äì13 Gallipoli ANZAC beach-head area defended by the brigade On 8 May 1915, the regiment, reduced to twenty-five officers and 453 other ranks (some men had to stay behind to look after the horses), with the remainder of the brigade, sailed for Gallipoli and landed three days later, under small arms fire, at ANZAC Cove, as part of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC).Wilkie 1924, pp.14‚Äì15 They relieved elements of the Royal Naval Brigade, with the regiment taking over from the Nelson and Deal Battalions, on the right flank. One squadron occupied the front line, one squadron the support trench, and the third was the reserve. The regiment was on the left, the Auckland Mounted Rifles in the centre, and the Canterbury Mounted Rifles on the right.Wilkie 1924, pp.15‚Äì18Nicol 1921, p.33 They spent the next few days improving the fire trenches, constructing communications trenches, and enlarging tracks so men and guns could move forward quickly. This was done under Turkish machine-gun and rifle fire.Wilkie 1924, p.18 First combat At midnight on 18 May the Turkish troops opened fire on the regiment until 03:30, then left their trenches and charged the mounted brigade, concentrating on the Auckland Mounted Rifles. The Turkish attackers were engaged by the regiment's machine- guns with enfilade fire and the attack petered out at dawn, leaving hundreds of Turkish dead. Both sides continued shooting at each other with artillery and small arms fire. At 13:25 General Alexander Godley, commanding that section of the beach-head, ordered the regiment to counter-attack the Turkish trenches at \\"The Nek\\". Their first trench was across no man's land with no cover at all. The regiment prepared to obey the order, but arranged it so that no one squadron would be wiped out. The men were selected in equal proportion from all three squadrons and Captain William Hardham VC was chosen to command them. Brigadier-General Andrew Russell, commanding the brigade, contacted Godley to advise him of the circumstances of such an attack and Russell was told to \\"use his own judgement\\" so promptly called it off.Wilkie 1924, pp.21‚Äì23Nicol 1921, pp.42‚Äì43 The morning of 20 May started the same way, with Turkish artillery and small arms fire being directed at the regiment's trenches. This lasted until 16:30 when the firing ceased and white flags appeared above the Turkish trenches. The Turkish commander asked for an armistice, so that they could collect their dead and wounded lying in the open. But as it appeared they were using the time to bring forward reinforcements, repair defences and collect arms and ammunition from the dead, the armistice was turned down. Negotiations continued and a truce was agreed for 24 May between 07:30 and 17:00. The regiment sent out men to collect and bury Allied dead. The next day the 3rd Light Horse Brigade relieved the regiment, and they moved to a safer area in the rear. Even when \\"resting\\" in the rear, they were not safe as it was constantly shelled, and work details had to be provided to move supplies and construct better defences.Wilkie 1924, pp.24‚Äì26 Defence of No.3 Post On 28 May the regiment had to man a position just captured by the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, called No.3 Post. The 6th Squadron was chosen and started improving the trenches on arrival. Daylight was at 03:30 and although having worked all night, they had made no real impression on the position and were exposed to Turkish fire all day. However, instead of abandoning the post, at 21:00 they were relieved by the 9th Squadron. An hour later Major Selwyn Chambers, commanding the 9th Squadron reported they were surrounded by about one thousand Turkish troops. At 23:35 communications with the 9th Squadron failed. The squadron were fighting off attacks, but could not stop Turkish troops reaching the edge of their trench and throwing hand grenades into their positions. A troop from the 2nd Squadron, sent as reinforcements, were unable to break through. So at midnight the remainder of the 2nd Squadron attempted to reach them, but instead had to dig in to defend themselves.Wilkie 1924, pp.27‚Äì29 Even though outnumbered, both squadrons managed to hold out, providing covering fire for each other. At 03:30 another Turkish attempt to capture their trenches began, this time from the south. When Turkish troops got into the left side of the 2nd Squadron trench, Major James Elmslie led a troop in a counter-attack, clearing them out. At 06:30, by using signal flags, communications with regimental headquarters were re-established. Casualties were mounting and supplies of ammunition dwindling, and the defence was becoming untenable. The 6th Squadron managed to reach the 2nd Squadron's position, but in the face of heavy Turkish fire, were unable to advance any further. Around 12:00 Turkish troops got into the 9th Squadrons trenches, forcing one troop to withdraw. After Captain Spragg of 9th Squadron located an abandoned supply of British ammunition, the New Zealanders were able to return fire at will without having to conserve ammunition. Nevertheless, the Turkish force, now numbering about three thousand men, continued their attacks all day.Wilkie 1924, pp.29‚Äì31 At 19:00 Turkish troops captured the northern section of the 9th Squadron trench. With no chance of any relief during daylight, the commanding officer was informed that two squadrons from the Canterbury Mounted Rifles would try to relieve the 9th Squadron after 20:00.Wilkie 1924, p.31 By this time the 6th Squadron had fought their way round the southern slopes of the hill and got within of the 9th Squadron's trench, but could make no further progress. As darkness approached Turkish fire reduced, and at 22:30 the Canterbury Mounted Rifles reached 9th Squadron and took over from them at 23:00. The 9th Squadron moved to the rear followed an hour later by the 2nd and 6th Squadrons. During the battle the squadrons were outnumbered and fighting at close quarters, but their casualties were rather light at nineteen dead and fifty-two wounded.Wilkie 1924, pp.32‚Äì33 Walker's Ridge The regiment returned to the front on 7 June, relieving the 8th Light Horse Regiment on Walkers Ridge. The 2nd and 9th Squadrons manned the front trench, with the 6th Squadron in reserve.Wilkie 1924, pp.36‚Äì37 Trench warfare, shelling and sniping continued all month but there was no major attack. The regiment spent their time rotating through the front and resting at the rear. On 1 July reinforcements of four officers and ninety-seven other ranks arrived. On 18 July the regiment returned to the front, relieving the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, each squadron with two troops forward and the other two in reserve. They remained there until 31 July when they were relieved by the 10th Light Horse Regiment. Returning to the rear, the regiment only had twenty-four officers and 338 other ranks, almost 200 men short of full establishment.Wilkie 1924, pp.37‚Äì39 Chunuk Bair Some of the regiment's survivors after the Battle of Chunuk Bair In August Godley planned a new offensive. The brigade was designated as the \\"Right Covering Force\\", and allocated several objectives including \\"No.3 Post\\", \\"Big Table Top\\" and \\"Destroyer Ridge\\". The regiment, supported by a Maori pioneer battalion, were given \\"Destroyer Ridge\\" and \\"Big Table Top\\" to capture. On 5 August the regiment moved to their starting position at \\"No.1 Post\\", the attack being planned for the following day. Two troops from 6th Squadron were to capture \\"Destroyer Ridge\\", and then clear the route to \\"Big Table Top\\", which the remainder of the regiment was to assault at 22:00.Wilkie 1924, pp.40‚Äì45 At 21:30 6 August the attack began; after covering around the leading troops were discovered by a Turkish sentry. The 6th Squadron charged the trenches, killing the occupants, but it cost them two men dead and one wounded including the squadron commander. The rest of the squadron continued clearing the route for the regiment. Thick impenetrable bush, forced the regiment to move further east to continue. Scaling the north-eastern face of the hill, they reached the summit at 22:55, and attacked the Turks from the rear.Wilkie 1924, pp.45‚Äì46 The regiment worked to secure the position from attack by the Turkish forces. Their total casualties for the operation were eight dead and nine wounded, but they had captured 158 prisoners, without firing a shot.Wilkie 1924, p.48 The next morning, 7 August, the 6th Squadron and Maoris rejoined the regiment, just as they came under heavy machine-gun and rifle fire.Wilkie 1924, p.50 The next day the regiment, along with the Auckland Mounted Rifles, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and two British battalions, were combined as No.1 Column commanded by Brigadier-General Francis Johnston. The Column were to hold the ground already occupied and extend their lines to the south and east. Leaving the 9th Squadron defending \\"Big Table Top\\", the rest of the regiment, 173 all ranks, reported to Johnstone at \\"Chailak Dere\\", where they ordered to hold the position \\"to the last man\\" alongside the Otago Infantry Battalion. The regiment spent the night improving the crescent shaped position, on the rear slope of the hill. All during the following day, the attacking Turks, sky-lining themselves at the crest of the hill, became easy targets for the regiment, and were engaged with enfilade fire, from the left and right of the regiment's lines.Wilkie 1924, pp.51‚Äì55 At 16:00 the regiment was attacked in force, but the Turks withdrew after suffering heavy casualties. But the British attack elsewhere had failed, and some units had been forced to retire, leaving the regiment exposed. They fought off attacks throughout the night, until 05:00 the next morning. Then for two hours they were harassed with sniper fire and hand grenades. Meldrum asked the brigade for reinforcements and more ammunition. There were no reserves of ammunition available and the only reinforcements were forty men from the 6th Battalion Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) who were sent to assist, but did not arrive until noon.Wilkie 1924, p.55 At 14:00 Meldrum reported he could now hold out until nightfall and at 22:30 they were relieved by the rest of the Loyal Regiment and the 5th Battalion Wiltshire Regiment. In the day's fighting the regiment, from a total of 173 all ranks, had lost forty-three dead and seventy-four wounded.Wilkie 1924, pp.55‚Äì57 Early on 10 August the survivors, less the 9th Squadron, moved into a camp at \\"No.1 Post\\". The 9th Squadron, now one hundred men strong, remained at the front defending \\"Table Top\\" and \\"Old No.3 Post\\". The next day at 19:30 the brigade moved back to man the inner defence line. The regiment, still without the 9th Squadron, occupied the \\"Camel's Hump\\" with twelve men, and \\"Destroyer Ridge\\" with twenty-five men, the remainder being held in reserve. They remained at the front until relieved on 23 August.Wilkie 1924, pp.59‚Äì60 Hill 60 Big Table Top; the route the regiment used to climb the cliff is shown by the dotted line. On 21 August the regiment moved back to \\"Big Table Top\\" for the pending assault on Hill 60. The attack, at 15:30, succeeded in capturing around of Turkish trenches. Two days later, at 17:15, the regiment was relieved and rejoined the brigade at Kabak Kuyu, but at 19:30, five officers and 125 other ranks had to return to the front to defend the western slopes of Hill 60. The same day, three officers and seventy-seven other ranks arrived as reinforcements for the regiment.Wilkie 1924, p.61 On 25 August those men still at the front were relieved by the Canterbury Mounted Rifles and Otago Mounted Rifles, in preparation for a night assault on Hill 60 by the brigade. The assault was postponed for two days to rest the men. Although the brigade was responsible for the centre objective during the assault, it could only provide three hundred men, with another one hundred men coming from the Australian 18th Battalion. The regiment's contribution was five officers and 125 other ranks. The battle commenced with an hour-long artillery bombardment. The Auckland and Canterbury Mounted Rifles formed the first line of attack, the Wellington regiment and the Otago Mounted Rifles the second, and the Australians made up the third line. At 17:00 the attack began, and despite taking heavy casualties crossing no man's land, the first Turkish line was captured. The Wellington regiment and Otago Mounted Rifles continued on, took out a machine-gun post and captured the second Turkish trench, but sustained heavy casualties.Wilkie 1924, p.62Nicol 1921, pp.81‚Äì82 On the other flanks the supporting assaults had failed, leaving the regiment and the Otago Mounted Rifles isolated on a narrow front. The brigade therefore consolidated the ground already captured and moved forward their machine-guns to support the defence; the forward defensive line was only forty men. The regiment's casualties during the battle were fifty dead and fifty-nine wounded.Wilkie 1924, pp.63‚Äì64 That night the remainder of the regiment moved into the front line. They fought off several counter-attacks, losing another man killed and eleven wounded.Wilkie 1924, pp.65‚Äì66 On 29 August the regiment was relieved by the 163rd (Norfolk & Suffolk) Brigade, but remained in the reserve trenches for the next three days. Even there the number of casualties continued to increase, so that by 2 September there were only six officers and ninety-nine men left in the regiment. Despite this, they still had to supply five officers and thirty-nine other ranks to occupy a trench on \\"Cheshire Ridge\\".Wilkie 1924, p.67 Evacuation By 13 September the regiment's strength was four officers and eighty other ranks. All of them except fourteen machine-gunners were evacuated to the island of Lemnos. Of the original contingent who had landed in May only twenty-four men were still with the regiment. On 10 November reinforcements increased the regiment's total to nine officers and 363 other ranks, and they returned to Gallipoli,Wilkie 1924, p.68 reaching the front line at Hill 60 on 27 November. Lack of manpower meant they could not fully man their trenches, so a system was adopted where six men manned a post, with only two on duty during the day. At night all men were awake and also patrolled between posts and into no man's land.Wilkie 1924, pp.69‚Äì70 On 17 December, orders for the complete evacuation of the peninsula were issued. The regiment started leaving the next day, when six officers and 155 other ranks left for Lemnos before dawn. Those left behind had to make it appear that the trenches were fully occupied. At 21:30 two-thirds of the remainder were evacuated. Other smaller parties left the trenches between 01:40 and 02:05, when the last officer and eleven other ranks moved down to the beach and were evacuated.Wilkie 1924, p.72 The surviving 375 men of the regiment camped on Lemnos until transport was available to take them back to Egypt. Their involvement in the Gallipoli Campaign had cost the regiment a total of 640 casualties. Sinai=Katia On 22 December the regiment left Lemnos; they disembarked at Alexandria four days later. On 27 December they arrived back at Zeitoun camp. There they were reunited with their horses, and reinforcements arrived to bring the regiment back up to full establishment, plus another ten percent. At the same time the Machine-Gun Section was doubled from two to four guns. On 23 January 1916 the regiment were deployed in defence of the Suez Canal, reaching Serapeum on 29 January and Ferry Post Rail Head on 5 March where they took over from two infantry brigades.Wilkie 1924, pp.77‚Äì80Nicol 1921, p.96 Later that month the brigade was assigned to the newly formed ANZAC Mounted Division, alongside three Australian light horse brigades and a British Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) brigade.Gullet 1923, p.57 Northern Sinai Desert The regiment mixed defending the canal with further training, each man getting used to their arms and equipment. They carried 240 rounds of ammunition in two bandoleers, one around the horse's neck. The horses also carried saddle wallets containing clothing and a blanket or great coat, water, rations, cooking utensils, empty sandbags, and a rope for tethering the horse.Wilkie 1924, p.85 On 23 April they were ordered to move into the Sinai Desert to assist the 5th Mounted Brigade who were under attack.Nicol 1921, p.99 Travelling overnight they reached Kantara at dawn and crossed the canal. However the Turkish force had withdrawn, so the brigade established a chain of observation posts in the desert. The Wellingtons were near Hill 70, in the No.3 Section of the canal's defence zone.Wilkie 1924, p.83 The regiment remained at Hill 70 until 12 May, when they moved north-east to Maler. On arrival they established a line of observation posts and sent reconnaissance patrols further east into the desert.Wilkie 1924, p.86 Four days later the 2nd Squadron sent a troop on a reconnaissance to Sabhket El Bardawil. On 18 May the regiment occupied the Katia Oasis, and the next day sent a patrol to Ard to the east. They gained their first sight of Turkish forces in the region, but they were too distant to engage.Wilkie 1924, p.87 On 29 May the regiment, along with the rest of the brigade, travelled thirty miles overnight to Salmana, and early next morning surprised the Turkish garrison. The main part of the assault was carried out by the Auckland Mounted Rifles. The water supply at Salmana was insufficient for a complete mounted brigade, so they had to return to Maler that night.Wilkie 1924, p.89 Between 21‚Äì23 June the regiment provided flank protection for the 1st Light Horse Brigade on a reconnaissance of Katia. Then, on their return to Maler, they were attached to the 2nd Light Horse Brigade,Nicol 1921, p.108 who gave them the nickname \\"Well and Trulys\\".Wilkie 1924, pp.89‚Äì90 In July the regiment lost its machine-gun section, which was transferred to the newly formed brigade Machine-Gun Squadron.Luxford 1923, pp.178‚Äì179 The Maxim guns were replaced by three Lewis guns, one per squadron.Gullett 1923, p.120 The loss of the section also reduced the regiment's establishment to twenty-four officers and 499 other ranks.Powles 1922, p.6 Romani On 19 July, reconnaissance aircraft located a Turkish force in the desert moving west. The regiment and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade were ordered to establish a line of observation posts in their path. They were to send out patrols to locate them, but withdraw if attacked. If possible, they were to retire towards Romani, enticing the Turks to follow them.Wilkie 1924, p.92 At dawn on 20 July the regiment located the Turks digging trenches near Ogratina. Rifle fire was exchanged and some prisoners were captured. The prisoners revealed that the force comprised twelve battalions with artillery support, planning to attack Romani. Two days later, on 22 July, the regiment again encountered Turkish troops, this time at Sagia. Over the following days they were employed checking the Turkish positions and shadowing their line of march. On 28 July, the 2nd Squadron located a strong Turkish force at Umm Ugba north of Katia. Covered by artillery and machine-guns, two of the regiment's squadrons carried out a bayonet charge and captured the position. They lost two men dead and three wounded during the battle.Wilkie 1924, p.93 Turkish trenches at Romani On 3 August, still with the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, the regiment returned to Katia. Forming the vanguard, they came under Turkish fire on their approach, and as Katia appeared to be held in strength by the Turks, the brigade set up a line of observation posts to monitor them until nightfall. They then retired to Maler, unknowingly being followed by the Turks. At 23:30 the 1st Light Horse Brigade reported movement to their front, and thirty minutes later shots were exchanged at Mount Meredith and Hod El Enna. The regiment had just settled down for the night and were ordered to stand to. At 02:15 4 August, fighting broke out along the front line and two hours later the 1st Light Horse Brigade carried out a fighting withdrawal. At dawn the regiment was the brigade reserve behind the 6th and 7th Light Horse Regiments. By 05:00 the Turkish force was outflanking both their defences and the ANZAC Mounted Division headquarters, which was co-located at the regiment's position. Two hours later they were ordered to gallop to the front line. Riding through rifle and machine-gun fire, they moved to the left and rear of the 6th and 7th Light Horse Regiments.Wilkie 1924, p.95Gullet 1923, p.148 Once the regiment's position was established, the Australian regiments pulled back to form a line with them. As the Turks advanced and occupied the ridge line previously held by the light horse, they brought artillery and machine-gun fire down onto the division's rear areas. The situation appeared serious, and the regiment's clerks were ordered to burn all their papers.Wikie 1924, p.96 Just before 10:00 reinforcements, consisting of a yeomanry regiment, two Scottish infantry companies and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, arrived and began attacking the Turkish left. By 18:00 they had captured the position. The regiment's casualties during the day were twenty-four wounded.Wilkie 1924, p.97 Orders were given for a counter-attack the next morning. The assault started at 04:00 on 5 August, and the regiment charged forward on foot with bayonets fixed. Ignoring the machine-gun and rifle fire they broke through the Turkish lines, capturing several hundred prisoners. Meldrum ordered their horses forward and they continued the attack on horseback. They stopped when they came under heavy artillery and machine-gun fire approaching Katia.Wilkie 1924, p.98 In the face of such fire they were unable to continue without more support, so dismounted and observed the Turkish positions. Gradually the rest of the division arrived and strengthened the regiment's line. At 09:00 Meldrum was asked by the artillery for assistance. Two batteries following behind the advance were being attacked by Turkish infantry. So Meldrum sent two of his squadrons to help, but the Turkish attackers vanished before they arrived. At 10:00 Meldrum had to take over as temporary commander of the 2nd Light Horse brigade, and Major Spragg became the temporary regimental commanding officer.Wilkie 1924, p.99 The next attack was timed for 14:30; the regiment would be part of the force assaulting Katia, on the front left, alongside the 6th Light Horse Regiment. Advancing through artillery and machine-gun fire until they were from the Turkish lines, they halted and returned fire.Wilkie 1924, p.100 At one stage the regiment had to bend their line, when the unit to their left gave ground and the Turkish forces moved forward trying to outflank them. Heavy fire from the regiment broke that attack, and the counter- attacking Turks withdrew. By nightfall no further move forward was possible, and as the horses needed watering, the attack was called off. The regiment had fought all day, but their casualties were rather light; one officer and nine other ranks wounded, some mortally. They had captured one thousand prisoners.Wilkie 1924, p.101 Typical trooper and horse Abd Having not slept for the last three days, the Wellingtons and the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades were rested. Meanwhile, the remainder of the division continued the counter-attack against the Turkish rearguard. On 8 August the Turks were at Abd, and the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades were ordered forward. Reaching Katia later that day, they were ordered to march through the night to take part in the assault at dawn the next morning. Setting out at 23:00, they were in position north-west of Ard by 05:00 on 9 August.Wilkie 1924, p.102 Half an hour later the Wellington regiment, in the vanguard, led the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on foot to capture a ridge of high ground half a mile (.8 km) from the Turkish main defence line. Once in position there, they came under constant artillery fire. Later the regiment again led the brigade to capture another ridge to their left, with the 2nd Squadron advancing on the left and the 9th Squadron on the right, supported by the 6th Squadron in reserve. The attack, which was covered by the 7th Light Horse Regiment, advanced through machine- gun and rifle fire until the ridge was captured, but the New Zealanders then came under an intense artillery bombardment.Wilkie 1924, p.103 At 13:30 the Turks counter-attacked, reaching the 1st Light Horse Brigade who were alongside the Wellingtons, and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade on the other flank who were forced to retire. At 16:30 the division's situation appeared untenable; orders were issued to evacuate the wounded and for the whole line to retire, while remaining in contact with the Turks. By nightfall the regiment had returned to Oghratina. Their casualties were three dead and twenty-nine wounded.Wilkie 1924, pp.103‚Äì105 The next day the regiment rested as the Turkish force withdrew. On 11 August they moved forward across the battleground; the only Turkish troops they encountered were engaged in burying their dead. The next day the Turkish force had withdrawn to Salmana.Wilkie 1924, p.105 On 27 August Meldrum resumed command of the regiment,Wilkie 1924, p.108 which then moved back to Kantara, with a strength of twenty-two officers and 407 other ranks. El Arish El Arish in 1916 While at Kantara leave was granted for all ranks in Port Said and Sidi Bishr during September. On 10 October, once more part of the New Zealand brigade, the regiment moved forward to Maler, and reached Geeila, further east, on 24 October. The next phase of the campaign was an advance of across the desert to El Arish. The regiment continued moving east, reaching Moseifig on 27 October, and a troop from the 9th Squadron located a good water supply at Gererat only from El Arish. On 11 November, the regiment advanced another east to Mustagidda, establishing outposts at Arnussi and Zoabitia.Wilkie 1924, pp.109‚Äì110 Overnight 15/16 November the post at Arnussi was attacked by Turkish camel troops, which withdrew before dawn.Wilkie 1924, p.111 The Allied attack on El Arish began on 20 December, the New Zealand and 3rd Light Horse Brigades being chosen to carry out the final assault from the south, while the rest of the division cut off any retreat. By dawn the brigade was in sight of its objective, and the town was surrounded. They then discovered that the Turkish forces, aware of the advance, had evacuated the town three days earlier.Wilkie 1924, p.112 Magdhaba That night, 22/23 December, the advance continued towards Magdhaba. This village was surrounded on three sides by a wadi, and defended by several redoubts which were covered by artillery and machine-guns. At 05:00 the regiment dismounted to the north-east of the village.Wilkie 1924, pp.113‚Äì114 The attack started just before 10:00. The regiment, positioned on the brigade's right, headed towards their objective, Redoubt No.5. They galloped across the open ground, through artillery and machine-gun fire, until they were from the Turkish lines, at which point they dismounted and continued on foot. Their Lewis Guns, supported by a section from the Machine-Gun Squadron, pinned down the Turkish defenders, while the assault continued.Wilkie 1924, p.115 By 11:00 the 6th and 9th Squadrons were only from the objective when Harry Chauvel, who was in command of the ANZAC Mounted Division, asked the Desert Mounted Corps commander, Philip Chetwode, for permission to withdraw because he believed that no progress had been made. Chetwode instead ordered an all out assault.Wilkie 1924, p.116 In the meantime, the regiment continued the advance anyway, and at 15:55 they fixed bayonets and charged the redoubt, capturing some of the Turkish defenders. At 16:40 the 10th Light Horse Regiment carried out a mounted charge into the middle of the position, and all resistance ceased.Wilkie 1924, pp.117‚Äì118 The battle had cost the regiment five dead. Palestine=Rafa On 9 January 1917, around 01:00, the regiment crossed the Egyptian‚ÄìPalestine border,Wilkie 1924, p.122 and continued northwards undetected until about 15:30, when Turkish observation posts set off flares to alert their troops of the Allied approach.Wilkie 1924, p.123 At 08:00 orders for the attack on Rafa were issued; the brigade was to form the right flank. At 09:35 the whole brigade galloped forward to a position two miles east-north-east of their objective.Wilkie 1924, p.124 The Auckland and Canterbury Mounted Rifles were to attack \\"C\\" Redoubt, while the Wellington Regiment was placed in reserve with a secondary task of providing protection against any attack on the brigade from the area of Khan Yunis. Already low on ammunition, once the assault began the regiment had to be resupplied with 24,000 rounds of machine- gun ammunition. At 13:00 two of the regiment's troops went forward to occupy a gap in the line between the New Zealand brigade's position and that of the Australian 1st Light Horse Brigade. Just before 14:00 one of the regiment's flank patrols, two miles north-east of Rafa, captured a Turkish officer and three Germans who, during questioning, claimed that the Rafa garrison consisted of 2,000 men, with four mountain artillery guns, and that the 160th Regiment was en route to reinforce the defenders.Wilkie 1924, pp.124‚Äì126 Another patrol reported that two infantry battalions were heading to Rafa from Abu Khatli, while a third patrol reported that around 2,000 men, about away, were coming from Khan Younis. Then another Turkish force was seen approaching, about away, but too far away to make out any details. At 15:45 the brigade was ordered to attack again, and fifteen minutes later another of the regiment's patrols reported 500 Turkish troops approaching from the east.Wilkie 1924, p.127 Hotchkiss gun team The approaching Turkish forces convinced Chetwode to call off the attack. But at 16:30, as the other brigades were retiring, the New Zealanders charged and captured their objective. This allowed them to bring enfilade fire onto the rest of the position. The rest of the division then resumed the attack and captured the village. By now the Turkish relief force was about two miles away to the north-east.Wilkie 1924, p.128 By 17:15 all the wounded had been evacuated and the covering patrols recalled. As there were no water supplies at Rafa, at 18:30 the brigade was ordered to withdraw back to Sheikh Zowaiid. Although not as heavily involved in the battle as other units, the regiment still had twelve men dead and eighteen wounded.Wilkei 1924, p.129 Gaza At 02.30 on 26 March, the regiment set out in thick fog for the assault on the town of Gaza. By 08:00 they had crossed the Wadi Ghuzze and reached Sheikh Abbas, confronted only by enemy aircraft and some Turkish camel patrols. Two hours later they were about to the east of Gaza, providing a guard force against any reinforcements that might approach from Hareira.Wlkie 1924, p.134 The British assault did not go according to plan, and at 14:00 the ANZAC Mounted Division was ordered to attack the town from the north. The regiment galloped forward together with the rest of the New Zealand brigade, and occupied Meshahera Ridge north-east of Gaza at 16:00. Dismounting, the regiment moved into Gaza, with the 6th Squadron leading, followed by the 2nd Squadron, and the 9th Squadron bringing up the rear.Wilkie 1924, pp.135‚Äì136 At 16:25 they captured a Turkish field ambulance; four officers, 125 other ranks and twenty vehicles. Continuing the assault through artillery and small arms fire, the 2nd and 9th Squadrons reached a cactus hedge. Cutting through it with their bayonets, they engaged the Turkish defenders behind it in hand-to-hand fighting. Two troops then charged across a lagoon, about deep, to capture a Turkish trench. To their right they sighted a Turkish artillery emplacement, and Meldrum ordered the position taken without delay. Two troops from the 2nd and one from the 9th Squadron carried out a bayonet charge and captured the guns intact.Wilkie 1924, p.136 Back in the regiment's centre they were held up by a strong Turkish defensive position at a cemetery. Instead of trying to attack the position, they held their line while the captured guns were recovered. The regiment was now some distance in front of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade to their left, and in danger of a flanking counter-attack. To assist the defence of their position, they turned one of the captured guns onto the Turkish strong points, the inexperienced gun crew sighting by peering down the barrel until they could see their target.Wilkie 1924, p.137 Guns captured by the Wellington Mounted Rifles at Gaza At 18:35, although Meldrum believed they could at least hold where they were, the regiment was ordered by Chetwode to withdraw. At 19:00 horse teams arrived to recover the guns, and at 19:45 they slowly retired back to the suburbs of Gaza. At 21:40 they rejoined the brigade and left the town. The next morning at 08:30 they arrived at Deir El Belah, where the division was now located. Casualties during the battle had again been rather light, at one dead and nineteen wounded. They had captured 197 prisoners, as well as the guns and field hospital.Wilkie 1924, p.139 The regiment's involvement in the second attempt to capture Gaza began at 18:30 on 16 April. The brigade left Deir El Belah, marched through the night and at 04:30 the next morning were at a ford on the Wadi Ghuzze at Shellal. A Turkish machine-gun post covering the crossing was taken out, and soon after the regiment formed the vanguard on the advance to the Rafa‚ÄìBeersheba road. By midday, despite being attacked by hostile aircraft, they had established a line of observation posts beside Im Siri. Turkish cavalry patrols were observed in the distance, but they did not attempt an attack on the regiment. By nightfall the brigade was recalled to Shellal, where they camped for the night. The next day was similar, again setting up posts observing Turkish movements, then returning to Shellal after dark. The main assault on Gaza was floundering, and the next day the ANZAC Mounted Division was ordered to assist the Imperial Mounted Division in attacking the Atawineh Redoubt, to the south- east of Gaza.Wilkie 1924, p.143 To get into position for the attack, the brigade marched through the night. Initially held in reserve, the Wellingtons were sent to assist the 5th Mounted Brigade in an attack on \\"Sausage Ridge\\", south of the Atawineh Redoubt. Getting into position at 11:30, Meldrum ordered the 6th Squadron to assault along the length of the ridge, with the help of fire support from the 9th Squadron and the Inverness Battery Royal Horse Artillery. The attack was also supported by the 3rd Squadron Auckland Mounted Rifles on the right of the 6th Squadron. At 12:30 the attack had progressed around half way up the ridge, at which point the Leicestershire and half of the Ayeshire Battery Royal Horse Artillery arrived to support the assault. They could not, however, prevent around six hundred Turkish reinforcements reaching the redoubt.Wilkie 1924, p.144 Second Gaza battle, showing the location of the Atawineh Redoubt Doubtful of their ability to capture the redoubt alone, at 13:15 Meldrum asked for reinforcements; he was informed there were no more available. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles, advanced into a gap between the Wellingtons and the 5th Mounted Brigade, which eased the pressure. By 15:00 the superior Turkish numbers and their strong defences, forced Meldrum to commit his reserve, the 2nd Squadron and a section of the Machine-Gun Squadron. At the same time, the horses were moved further to the rear so that they would be out of artillery range. At 15:15 the regiment's right was counter-attacked by three or four hundred Turkish troops. Fifteen minutes later Meldrum again asked for reinforcements; he was again refused. Supported by their artillery, the regiment held out until 17:00, when the Turks retired, having suffered heavy losses. An hour later the regiment was ordered to withdraw at nightfall. The 2nd Squadron reported that they had gained a position which allowed them to assault the redoubt. Meldrum, aware that the redoubt would have to be abandoned even if they were successful, refused to allow the assault.Wilkie 1924, pp.145‚Äì146 At 18:30 the Royal Horse Artillery withdrew. Then, confusingly, the regiment was ordered to remain where they were, until the yeomanry to their left had moved back. So it was not until 20:15 that the regiment left the front line. At 01:00 20 April the regiment reached the night camp at El Jemme. Their casualties during the battle amounted to one dead and twenty-three wounded. The same night, this second attempt to capture Gaza was called off.Wilkie 1924, p.147 Wadi Ghuzee line On 27 April Meldrum was promoted to brigadier-general and given command of the New Zealand brigade,Nicol 1921, p.144 although he was temporarily replaced as commanding officer by Major Charles Dick. On 30 April the Wellington regiment returned to the front, manning a line of observation posts in the Weli Sheikh Nuran defence system. They were at the right of the British line, which stretched along the Wadi Ghuzze to the Mediterranean Sea, south of Gaza.Wilie 1924, p.148 As well as manning the trenches, they carried out mounted patrols into no man's land. On 8 June it was their turn to return to the rear rest area at Marakeb, and Lieutenant-Colonel James Whyte assumed command of the regiment.Wilkie 1924, p.149 On 8 July, the 9th Squadron captured a Turkish outpost to the west of Beersheba, from which they could clearly see the village's defences. Ten days later the regiment assaulted what they believed was a strong Turkish position at Khalassa, but discovered the defenders had withdrawn before their approach.Wilkie 1924, p.151 On 19 July a Turkish force attacked across the Wadi Imleih towards Karm. The regiment moved forward to occupy a line of observation posts the next day, but again discovered that the Turks had withdrawn.Wilkie 1924, p.152 Over the next weeks the regiment carried out numerous patrols around Beersheba, checking on the Turkish defences and dispositions.Wlkie 1924, p.153 On 18 August they were sent to Marakeb to rest. Four weeks later, on 18 September, they returned to the front line at Fukhari.Wilkie 1924, p.154 Beersheba For the attack on Beersheba the New Zealand brigade was to move around the open Turkish left flank and assault the village from the east-north-east.Wilkie 1924, p.157 They moved to Esani, to the south-east, on 24 October, then on the next day the Wellingtons established a long observation line between two and south-west of Beersheba. On 28 October the regiment moved another south-east to Khalassa, then the next day to Asluj, to the south of Beersheba.Wilkie 1924, pp.159‚Äì160 Beersheba in 1917 Over the night of 30/31 October the attack on Beersheba began; the regiment formed part of the vanguard with the 6th Light Horse Regiment. At 00:45, the 9th Squadron lead and the 2nd Squadron provided flank and rear protection as the Wellingtons left the main column to capture a Turkish position at Goz El Shegeib, south-east of Beersheba. At 03:00 the position was secured ‚Äì it was unoccupied ‚Äì and the regiment remained there for instructions. Three hours later the 9th Squadron was attacked, from the north, by a squadron of Turkish cavalry. Supported by the 6th Squadron, they counter- attacked and forced the Turks to withdraw towards Beersheba. The regiment then moved to rejoin the brigade, which was now to the south-east of Beersheba. Continuing to move forward, at 08:00 they captured Salem Irgeig. The regiment now became the brigade reserve; the brigade assaulted the Saba Redoubt and captured it at 14:40. The 2nd Squadron was sent to reinforce the Auckland Mounted Rifles for their attack on Tel el Saba, which they captured at 15:00.Wilkie 1924, p.161 The rest of the regiment were not involved in the battle, and Beersheba was eventually captured with a mounted charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade. The Wellingtons casualties during the battle amounted to one dead and five wounded.Wilkie 1924, p.162 Holding their position overnight, at 07:00 the next morning the regiment advanced towards the crossing at El Likeyeh, to the north of Beersheba. Two hours later, just short of the crossing, the 6th Squadron, leading the regiment, were engaged by around 100 Turkish cavalry and two machine-guns. The squadron, supported by the 9th Squadron, immediately counter-attacked, and captured the position. They then continued on to their objective, where they met up with the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade (ICCB) and held the crossing until nightfall, when they were relieved so that they could return and camp at the Saba Redoubt. A shortage of water had affected all the division's operations, so on 2 November the brigade were moved east to Bir Imshash.Wilkie 1924, p.163 Ras El Nagb While the brigade was searching for water, the advance was running into problems. On 4 November the brigade was ordered to relieve the 5th Mounted Brigade at Ras El Nagb, north-east of Beersheba. At 17:30 the Canterbury Mounted Rifles arrived, followed by the 6th Squadron of the Wellington Mounted Rilfes, who lined up to the left of the Canterbury regiment, facing towards Kheuwelfeh. Their opposition was estimated to be around two thousand men and three artillery batteries. At 03:00 on 3 November the Turks began their attack; five hours later the 9th Squadron relieved the 6th Squadron in the front line. Only two hours later the 6th had to move back into the line, to the west of Ras El Nagb, where they stopped a Turkish attack trying to outflank the position. At 13:30 the 2nd Squadron came under a heavy artillery bombardment and suffered several casualties. After this the Turks carried out a bayonet charge, getting to within of the regiment's lines before, under heavy fire, they were forced to withdraw. The regiment managed to hold their position, by the weight of their fire power, until nightfall. The next morning the regiment was relieved by the ICCB. The battle had cost them nine men wounded. Gaza was captured on 7 November, but the regiment remained around Ras El Nagb until the night of 9 November.Wilkie 1924, pp.164‚Äì165 Ayun Kara Battle of Ayun Kara On 10 November the regiment returned to Beersheba, and the New Zealand brigade were ordered to move across the British front to the opposite flank.Nicol 1921, p.160 Four days later, just after 11:00, the 6th Squadron assisted the Canterbury Mounted Rifles in capturing a Turkish post defending the Wadi Hanein. But they could then see Turkish troops gathering in a nearby orange grove, and more Turkish troops to the north.Wilkie 1924, p.167 When the rest of the brigade arrived Meldrum ordered an immediate attack. The regiment was to advance along the main road, with the Auckland Mounted Rifles on their left. The Somerset Battery Royal Horse Artillery and the Machine-Gun Squadron would provide fire support. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles would be the reserve. At 13:30, covered by artillery fire, the 9th Squadron started the assault. Their first target was a trench system at the top of the hill. Supported by covering fire from a 6th Squadron troop, they charged and captured the position, also capturing a Lewis Gun and a Turkish machine-gun. As the 2nd Squadron secured the position, the 9th Squadron continued forward for their secondary objective, which they charged and captured; here they captured two more machine-guns.Wilkie 1924, p.168 At 14:15 the Auckland Mounted Rifles sighted a strong Turkish force preparing for a counter- attack,Nicol 1921, p.163 which began fifteen minutes later. Part of the assault came up against the left of the 9th Squadron, who fought off the attack with the support of five machine-guns. On the other flank the Auckland Mounted Rifles were under severe pressure and the regiment was ordered to assist them. Two troops from the 2nd Squadron mounted and galloped forward around across open ground. They then dismounted and charged a machine-gun post on the top of a knoll. Engaging the defenders in hand-to-hand combat, they captured the post and another machine-gun. From the knoll they were able to enfilade the Turkish troops attacking the Aucklanders, and forced them to retire.Nicol 1921, p.164Wilkie 1924, p.169 It was now 16:00 and the 9th Squadron, taking advantage of the Turkish withdrawal, charged and occupied the Turkish position in front of them. The 6th Squadron, on the right, also moved forward to support them. This prompted a general Turkish retirement, and by dusk they had left the battlefield. The Allies evacuated their wounded and, expecting another attack at dawn, prepared their defences. At 23:00 an Australian squadron and a camel squadron arrived to support the brigade. The regiment's casualties during the battle were eleven dead and forty-six wounded. Against that they had captured thirty-four prisoners as well as seven machine-guns and other military supplies.Wilkie 1924, p.170 River Auja The next day, 15 November, the Turkish force had completely withdrawn. The brigade continued the advance north, stopping just beyond Richon-le-Zion. The next day, at 09:30, patrols from the regiment entered the port of Jaffa. The town's only inhabitants were the civilian population, the Turkish troops having evacuated the town beforehand. At 11:00 the regiment's commander, Whyte, took formal possession of the Government buildings, posting guards at the German and Austrian Consulates and the post office.Wilkie 1924, p.172Nicol 1921, p.167 The Wellington regiment captures Jaffa; 16 November 1917. Two days later, on 18 November, the regiment moved into a line of observation posts along the River Auja. The next day a troop from the 2nd Squadron were sent to locate crossing points across the river. They located a dam and a bridge to the north-east. Dismounting and approaching on foot, they had one man wounded, who was later taken prisoner. The following day the regiment was relieved by the other rest of the brigade, and moved to the rear, returning to the front line on 21 November.Wilkie 1924, p.173 The brigade was ordered to mount an assault across the river at 13:00 on 24 November; the regiment's objective being Khirbet Hadrah.Nicol 1921, p.168 First across were the Canterbury Mounted Rifles who crossed by a ford at the rivers mouth. Behind them the 6th and 9th Squadrons crossed and moved along the river bank to the bridge at Jerisheh, which they captured at 15:30, taking twenty-two prisoners. With the bridge secure, the regimental headquarters and the 2nd Squadron moved across to reinforce the attack, which then captured Khirbet Hadrah, capturing twenty- five prisoners and two machine-guns.Wilkie 1924, p.174 With the crossing secured, the 161st (Essex) Brigade moved across the river to reinforce the defence. The Wellingtons established observation posts further to the north. The next morning the 2nd Squadron sent a patrol on a reconnaissance, which located a strong Turkish force approaching. By 05:30 this Turkish force were attacking the 2nd Squadron's posts. At 07:00 the rest of the regiment, still south of the river, moved to support the defenders at Kirbet Hadrah, where they came under an artillery bombardment. At the same time the 2nd Squadron was ordered to fall back to support the infantry at Sheikh Muannis. The Turks continued their assault, and at 08:15 had forced the infantry to withdraw south of the river.Wilkie 1924, p.175 Holding out until 09:30, the last unit to cross back over the river was the 2nd Squadron. In an attempt to keep possession of a crossing, the 6th and 9th Squadrons moved to cover the ford at the river mouth where they managed to stop the Turkish advance short of the ford. That night the 161st Brigade took over all the defences, but the New Zealanders remained close by to support them. The regiment had twelve men wounded during the fighting. They remained in the area until 4 December, when the brigade left for Ibn Ibrak, to the south-east of Jaffa, relieving the ICCB in the front line.Wilkie 1924, pp.176‚Äì177 On 11 December the regiment was attached to the 54th (East Anglian) Division at Beit Dejan as the army tactical reserve. Ten days later they were back with the New Zealand brigade, which was now north of the River Auja. The regiment encountered the Turkish rearguard at Ferrekhiyeh, but after locating the Turks' positions, the regiment was ordered back to Beit Dejan. Then they were ordered to move back to Sukereir, arriving on Christmas Day 1917.Wilkie 1924, pp.178‚Äì179 Jordan Valley=Jericho On 9 February the regiment started across country to Bethlehem, and by 17 February they were camped north-east of Bethlehem around the Mar Elias Monastery and Ibn Obeid. The same day, Whyte was injured in an aeroplane crash and Major Spragg became the temporary commanding officer.Wilkie 1924, pp.180‚Äì181 The next day, orders were issued for the capture of Jericho. The regiment were attached to the 60th (London) Division and had to move that night to be in position to begin the advance at 06:00 the next morning. They were tasked to be ready to intercept any retreating Turkish forces from El Muntar, which would be attacked by the infantry division.Wilkie 1924, p.182 Jericho operations That evening, 18 February, the regiment moved out, but before long the width of the track forced them to dismount and lead their horses by hand in single file. At 22:30 the head of the column came under fire from Turkish cavalry. They forced the Turks to withdraw, and later surrounded and captured several prisoners, one being Ali Salem a well-known Turkish spy. Continuing at 06:00 they captured their first objective two miles to the east of Mar Saba. Spreading out to capture any retreating Turkish forces, they advanced north, under fire, and at 10:40 joined up with the 60th Division.Wilkie 1924, p.183 Mounted patrols were then sent out, one of which located a strong Turkish position. Located on the \\"Ancient Road\\" to Hill 306 and on to Hill 288, the Turkish positions were supported by five artillery pieces at Neba Musa.Wilkie 1924, p.184 At 17:00 the regiment was released from their attachment to the 60th Division, and returned to the command of the New Zealand brigade, which was advancing along the Jordan Valley, joining them an hour later. Problems crossing the mountainous terrain postponed any attack until daylight. At 03:00 the brigade moved out again with the Wellingtons on the right, advancing towards Hill 306, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles on the left towards Hill 288 and the Auckland Mounted Rifles forming the reserve. The 6th Squadron attacked Hill 306 from the south and the 2nd Squadron from the south-west. At dawn they came up against a large group of Turks \\"in a fortress-like position on the top of a steep hill-face, bristling with machine guns, commanding the surrounding country\\".Nicol 1921, p.181 With no artillery available, the squadrons were unable to advance with any speed, using only their small arms to support the assault. A gap appeared in the line between the regiment and the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, who had moved further north then had been intended. So the Auckland Mounted Rifles moved forward to assault Hill 288 instead. These galloped forward and captured Hill 288, forcing the Turks to withdraw, and the Wellingtons occupied Hill 306. Turkish artillery bombarded the hill, while their troops retired to the east.Nicol 1921, pp.182‚Äì183 Holding an observation line overnight, at 06:00 the next morning the brigade advanced towards Jericho leaving the 9th Squadron to capture Rijm El Bahr, including its stores and boats, on the Dead Sea. Jericho was captured the same day by the Australian 1st Light Horse Brigade. As a whole, the operation cost the Wellingtons one killed and four wounded. On 22 February the regiment returned to Bethlehem along the Jericho‚ÄìJerusalem road, eventually returning to the Mar Elias Monastery. They met their commanding officer, Whyte, who had now recovered from his injuries. Three days later the brigade crossed back to the west, returning to Richon.Wilkie 1924, pp.186‚Äì187Nicol 1921, p.185 Amman A raid on Amman was the next operation for the regiment. The ANZAC Mounted Division, the 60th (London) Division and the ICCB would all take part.Nicol 1921, p.189 On 13 March the regiment started back to the Jordan Valley, through heavy rain. Orders for the raid were issued; the brigade would advance on mountain tracks via the village of Ain Es Sir, then to Amman.Wilkie 1924, pp.189‚Äì190 The rains continued postponing the raid and it was not until 01:30 on 24 March that the brigade crossed the River Jordan, by pontoon bridge at Hajlah. At 09:30 the regiment, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles and the 181st (2/6th London) Brigade started clearing the area between the river and the foothills. At 11:25 they charged and captured three artillery pieces.Wilkie 1924, p.193 The brigade advance continued at 15:00, without the 6th Squadron which remained behind to assist the 181st Brigade in their assault on Es Salt. Still negotiating the mountain track, it started to rain again at 18:00 and the brigade camped for the night; starting again next morning they reached Ain Es Sir just after midday. There they were forced to stop and wait for their supplies to catch up with them.Wilkie 1924, p.194 Amman Raid, March 1918 Early on 26 March the rest of the ANZAC Mounted Division arrived, and the ICCB that evening. To cut off Amman from reinforcements, one of the regiment's troops set out that night and destroyed a section of the Hedjaz rail line to the south of the town. They returned the next morning without loss. Orders were issued for the attack on the town; the brigade would assault from the south. The 2nd Squadron was to provide flank protection, located in the area south-east of Es Sir. The rest of the regiment, including the headquarters, the 9th Squadron, and half a section of the Machine-Gun Squadron, escorted a demolition party to destroy the railway station at Kissar, just under to the south of Amman.Wilkie 1924, p.195 En route the 9th Squadron located a train carrying around three hundred Turkish troops, stopped in a cutting. When they opened fire the train pulled out towards Kissar, where it ran into a squadron from the Auckland Mounted Rifles and one of the 9th Squadron's troops. Some of the Turks left the train to fight on foot, while the train continued on to Amman, leaving them behind. The regiment's men left the demolition party to be escorted by troops from the ICCB, and returned to the brigade outside Amman.Wilkie 1924, p.196Nicol 1921, p.198 On 28 March the brigade, reinforced by the 4th (ANZAC) Battalion ICCB, tried to capture Hill 3039 south-west of Amman. The attack failed and further attempts were postponed until after nightfall. The night assault began at 02:00; two troops of the 9th Squadron were involved in the second line to protect the left flank. The attack was successful and the brigade commenced improvements to the defences in order to withstand any counter-attack.Wilkie 1924, pp.197‚Äì198 The Wellingtons dug in at the centre of the position, with the Aucklands on their right and the Canterburys on the left. The expected counter-attack started at 05:00 with an artillery bombardment.Wilkie 1924, p.201 As the Turkish troop approached the brigade lines, at 09:20 an order to withdraw was given. As the regiment, the Canterburys and the cameliers started to retire, it allowed the Turks to reach the crest of Hill 3039. It was then realised the order was mistaken, and the brigade officers rallied their man and charged back, forcing the Turks back down the hill.Wilkie 1924, p.202 Further Turkish counter-attacks continued throughout the day, and at 16:00 a troop from the 9th Squadron on the right flank, when the Turkish got close to their lines, had to do a counter-attack of their own. By now it was appreciated that the division could not achieve their objectives, and a withdrawal back towards the Jordan river was ordered.Wilkie 1924, p.203 By 22:30 the wounded had been evacuated and the regiment pulled back unopposed, reaching Ain Es Sir at 04:00 the next day. Turkish troops then closed on their position, but that evening the 6th Squadron rejoined the regiment.Wilkie 1924, p.204 A line of observation posts were then established to monitor the approaching Turks. The regiment made plans to hold them off until the division passed through the village, and then withdraw back across the river. At 03:45 on 1 April, the 2nd Squadron formed a skirmish line to the north of Ain Es Sir, the 9th Squadron another line to the south-east, while the 6th Squadron were the reserve. By 07:00 the brigade, bringing up the rear, reached the village. Once they had passed them the 6th Squadron joined the end of the line. At 07:45 the 2nd Squadron opened fire on Turkish troops coming from the north, while the 9th Squadron withdrew, followed soon after by the 2nd Squadron. As they entered the village, enemy troops in the hills opened fire on them. The squadron immediately counter-attacked, supported by two troops from the 9th Squadron. The remainder of the regiment stopped to the south, forming a defensive line.Wilkie 1924, p.205Nicol 1921, pp.208‚Äì209 The Turkish troops in the hills were soon dealt with by the 2nd Squadron, and as they withdrew, the regiment was able to provide covering fire. Finally, just after 20:00, they arrived back at Shunet Nimrin, and camped for the night. Their casualties during the raid were fourteen dead and eight wounded. The brigade recrossed the River Jordan at the Ghoraniyeh pontoon bridge on 2 April.Wilkie 1924, pp.206‚Äì207 Ghoraniyeh New Zealanders crossing the River Jordan As the ANZAC Mounted Division pulled back to the west bank of the Jordan, the Wellingtons remained behind strengthening the defences at the Ghoraniyeh bridge-head.Wilkie 1924, p.208 On 18 April, the regiment, less the 6th Squadron, were part of a brigade force that advanced on the village of Shunet Nimrin. The operation was a deception to convince the Turks that further raids on Amman were imminent. The next day patrols from the regiment located a large Turkish force in the foothills around the village. The brigade positioned as if to attack them, then when they reinforced their position, the brigade withdrew. That night they crossed back over the river and camped outside Jericho. The regiment moved again on 23 April, to camp in the foothills to the south of Jericho. On 30 April the second raid across the Jordan began, their objective this time to capture Es Salt. This time a much larger force was involved, under command of the Desert Mounted Corps. The Wellingtons and the rest of the New Zealand brigade were part of the force assigned to attack the village of Shunet Nimrin. At 03:30 when the brigade crossed over the Ghoraniyeh pontoon, the regiment came under command of the 180th (2/5th London) Brigade, providing protection for their right flank as they advanced on the village. The difficult terrain and the strength of the Turkish defences hindered progress, and by dusk they were still some distance away from their objective. The next day the advance continued, but in the face of growing Turkish resistance, and with the arrival of Turkish reinforcements, they were in danger of being cut off and surrounded. So on 4 May the whole force withdrew back across the River Jordan, leaving the Wellingtons behind to protect the bridge-head.Wilkie 1924, pp.210‚Äì211 Many men were infected with malaria, and the regiment was periodically rotated away from the valley bottom to the western hills. Their first move back west was on the 16 May, when they moved to the brigade camp site near Talaat Ed Dumm, remaining there for the next thirteen days. On 30 May they moved to Solomon's Pools, to the south of Bethlehem. On 14 June the regiment returned to the front line at Ain Ed Duk, two miles north of Jericho. There they established observation posts to monitor Turkish activity, remaining until they were relieved on 30 June.Wilkie 1924, pp.212‚Äì213 Abu Tellul On 9 July Major Charles Dick assumed temporary command of the regiment, while Whyte was on leave and the regiment was in the front line near Abu Tellul. On 13 July the neighbouring sector of the line, a salient defended by the Australian 1st Light Horse Brigade, came under a heavy artillery bombardment. Some rounds landed on the regiment's positions, causing casualties. At dawn on 14 July German soldiers attacked the light horse brigade. By 07:00 they had broken the Australian lines in the east, and the Wellingtons came under command of the light horse brigade to support their defence. Thirty minutes later the 9th Squadron advanced, on foot, along the Wadi Aujah, and occupied a position on the west of the salient just before the Germans' Turkish allies attacked. The 9th Squadron managed to hold their line, but because they were engaging a far larger force, the 6th Squadron moved forward on their left to support them. The two squadrons' lines were able to mutually support each other and engage the attacking Turks with a \\"withering fire\\".Wilkie 1924, pp.214‚Äì215 Then the two squadrons and the light horse counter-attacked, forcing back their opposition and capturing 400 prisoners, sixty-one of them taken by the Wellingtons, along with a machine gun and a Bergman automatic rifle. The Turks continued to hold a position in the north until forced to withdraw by the New Zealanders. The regiment's casualties during the battle were four dead and nine wounded. They remained at the front until 19 July when they rotated back to Talaat Ed Dumm.Wilkie 1924, pp.215‚Äì216 Chaytor's Force Jordan Valley area In August the brigade formed the divisional reserve located around Jericho. In September they moved forward to form the left (northern) flank of the Jordan Valley defences. At the same time, the brigade took command of the 1st and 2nd Battalions British West Indies Regiment and the 38th and 39th Battalions Royal Fusiliers, which were part of a larger deception force commanded by the divisional commander, Chaytor.Wilkie 1924, p.218 They were tasked with convincing the Turks that the next British attack would be from the Jordan Valley, while the forces were actually being realigned to attack in the west. The regiment was heavily involved in the deception, carrying out offensive patrolling, constructing dummy camps, and moving back and forwards behind the lines to give the impression of a much larger force than was actually present.Wilkie 1924, p.219 The British attack in the west began on 19 September; the next day the New Zealand brigade started increasing pressure on the Turkish positions opposite them. The first breakthrough was made on 21 September, by the Auckland Mounted Rifles. At 18:30 the brigade was ordered to advance on Kherbet Fusail, with the objective of securing a position at Damieh.Wilkie 1924, p.222 By midnight the brigade had reached Kerbet Fusail, and the Wellingtons were ordered to seize El Makhruk and at the same time occupy the roads leading north and west. The 9th Squadron lead the regiment, and moved along the Wadi Farah towards El Makhruk. As they closed on the village they could hear vehicles moving along the road. Pressing forward they captured four hundred prisoners, including the commander and staff of the Turkish 53rd Division, seventy transport vehicles and a large quantity of supplies. Moving on, at 04:30 they reached and occupied the village.Wilkie 1924, p.224 The 2nd and 9th Squadrons remained at El Makhurk, while the 6th Squadron continued north-west for another to occupy the neighbouring village of Tel El Mazar where they captured even more Turkish supplies and equipment.Wilkie 1924, p.225 On 23 September it was apparent that the Turkish Fourth Army was trying to withdraw north. The brigade was ordered to try and intercept them. The 6th Squadron, with a West Indies battalion, were left to guard the Damieh bridge, while the remainder of the brigade moved towards Es Salt, which they occupied at 16:20 the same day.Wilkie 1924, pp.226‚Äì227 The next day, 24 September, the brigade continued its advance by heading towards Suweileh, with the Wellingtons protecting the open flank. The next day the ANZAC mounted division was ordered to capture Amman. The Wellingtons provided the vanguard, and at 07:45, two miles north-west of Amman, the 9th Squadron, in the lead, was engaged by machine-gun and rifle fire and could see Turkish cavalry in the distance. At 08:10 the 2nd Squadron moved forward to support the 9th, but came under fire from two redoubts. They took cover and were able to bring enfilade fire onto the redoubts and also onto a force of Turkish reinforcements preparing a counter-attack. At 10:00 the 9th Squadron were relieved by the 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigade. Manoeuvring enabled the division to press forward, forcing the Turkish defenders to retire. At 11:30 the regiment, with the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, were ordered to assault Amman. Leaving the 2nd Squadron to deal with concealed machine-gun posts, the rest continued the attack. By 14:40 they had closed on Amman and the 9th Squadron had captured a hill in front of Stone Tower. At 15:00 the Canterbury Mounted Rifles galloped into the town and all resistance there ceased. The regiment pressed forward along the Wadi Amman and captured three artillery pieces. By 16:30 all Turkish positions had been taken, along with hundreds of prisoners.Wilkie 1924, pp.228‚Äì230 That was the last battle of the campaign fought by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. The regiment camped beside the town until 29 September, when they left for Ziza to assist the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, who had captured five thousand prisoners. On 1 October they set out to return to the Jordan Valley.Wilkie 1924, p.231 Post war The regiment's part in the war was now effectively over. On 4 October they camped to the north-west of Jericho for the next four days. They then moved back to their old camp at the Mar Elias monastery, and eventually reached Richon le Zion on 14 October.Wilkie 1924, pp.231‚Äì234 By January 1919, the regiment were still waiting to return home, and had begun education courses, continuation training and playing sports. This occupied them until March when a revolt broke out in Egypt, and the regiment drew its equipment back out of storage and headed for the Nile Delta. Posted to Quesna, all of the regiment's squadrons, except the 9th which went to Cairo, began policing the riots and trying to stop looting.Wilkie 1924, p.238 Once the rioting had been quelled, the regiment once again waited to return home. Their return finally began on 30 June 1919, when the majority of the brigade left the Suez Canal for New Zealand and the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment ceased to be a unit.Wilkie 1924, p.240 Casualties During its service 369 of the regiment's men died from all causes, either killed in action, died of wounds or of disease. Another 453 men were wounded, some more than once. More than half of the dead, 207 men, were killed during the seven months they fought in the static trench warfare of the Gallipoli Campaign; another 129 men were killed during their two years of more mobile warfare in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Gallipoli also accounted for more than half of the wounded, a total of 258 men compared to 195 men who were wounded in Sinai and Palestine.Wilkie 1924, pp.244‚Äì259 Many of the Gallipoli dead have no known grave. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission Chunuk Bair Cemetery, constructed on the site where the Turks buried Allied war dead after the evacuation, has 632 graves of which only ten men have been identified. Similarly, the nearby Hill 60 Cemetery has another 788 graves, of which only seventy-six were identified. Honours Several men of the regiment were recognised for their service by the British Empire awards system. The regiment's first commanding officer, Meldrum, was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath, a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). His successor, Whyte, was also invested with a DSO, as well as a Bar as a second award. Another four officers were also invested with a DSO, while seven officers were awarded a Military Cross, one was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, and another a Member of the Order of the British Empire. The regiment's other ranks were awarded five Distinguished Conduct Medals and twenty Military Medals, and there were fifty-nine Mentions in Despatches amongst all ranks, some men being mentioned more than once.Wilkie 1924, pp.242‚Äì243 References ;Footnotes ;Citations ;Bibliography    Category:New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade Category:Military units and formations established in 1914 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1919 Category:Mounted infantry regiments of New Zealand in World War I Category:History of the Wellington Region Category:1914 establishments in New Zealand ","title":"Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment"},{"id":"18675517","text":"Denis Stinat (born 18 July 1983 in Chartres) is a French association football defender who currently plays for Bayonne.

Languages Languages are: Marathi, Maharashtrian Konkani, Konkani proper, Kukna, Phudagi, Kadodi (Samvedi), Katkari, Varli, Deccani. Venn diagram of the ISO codes assigned to the Konkani languages Several of the Marathi-Konkani languages have been variously claimed to be dialects of both Marathi and Konkani.  Maharashtrian Konkani  A collection of dialects of Marathi-Konkani languages spoken in the Konkan region is referred to as Maharashtrian Konkani. It is often mistakenly extended to cover Goan Konkani which is an independent language. George Abraham Grierson has referred to this dialect as the Konkan Standard of Marathi in order to differentiate it from Konkani language.Konkani Detailed Description ‚Äî The sub-dialects of Konkani gradually merge from standard Marathi into Goan Konkani from north to south Konkan. The various sub dialects are: Parabhi, Koli, Kiristanv, Kunbi, Agari, Dhangari, Thakri, Karadhi, and Maoli.Konkani Detailed Description ‚Äî These sub-dialects are together considered by the ISO to be a separate language and is assigned the ISO 639-3 code knn. * Agari (Spoken by the Agri community found in Raigad & Thane district of Maharashtra; Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu; Gujarat) *Thakri (Spoken by the Adivasi and katkari community found in Raigad district of Maharashtra) *Koli (Spoken by the Koli or fishermen community found in Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Raigad district of Maharashtra) * Warli (Varli) language spoken by the Warli people. Although commonly associated with Maharashtra and found in Gujarat too, Varlis (Warlis) consider the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to be their original home.  Phudagi  Phudagi or Vadvali was primarily spoken by Vadvals, which basically means agricultural plot owners, of the Naigaon, Vasai to Dahanu region. Somavamshi Kshatriyas speak this dialect. This language is preserved mostly by the Roman Catholics native to this region, since they are a closely knit community here and have very few relatives outside this region. It was also widely spoken among the Hindus native to this region, but due to external influences, ordinary Marathi is now more popular among the Hindus. There are many songs in this language. Recently a book was published by Nutan Patil containing around 70 songs. The songs are about marriage, pachvi etc. The dialect of the Kolis (fisherfolk) of Vasai and neighbouring Mumbai resembles this dialect closely, though they speak with a heavier accent. There is a village in Vasai called Chulna, which was predominantly Roman Catholic (now cosmopolitan). The striking feature of the dialect here contrasting it with Phudagi, is the preference of pronouncing the thinner 'l' and 'n' ('‡§≤' and '‡§®') instead of the thicker 'l' and 'n' ('‡§≥' and '‡§£'), which is retained even in the current generation of speakers even for conversing normal Marathi.  Samavedi  Samavedi or Kadodi is spoken in the interiors of the Vasai- Virar and Nala Sopara regions along the north of Mumbai, up to the Thane, Panvel and Uran talukas of Maharashtra. The name of this language correctly suggests that its origins lie with the Samavedi Brahmins native to this region. This language, too, finds more speakers among the Roman Catholic converts native to the region (who are known as East Indians), but nevertheless is popular among the Samavedi Brahmins. This dialect is very different from the other Marathi dialects spoken in other regions of Maharashtra, but resembles Vadvali very closely. Both Vadvali and Samavedi have relatively high proportions of words imported from Portuguese as compared to ordinary Marathi, because of direct influence of the Portuguese who colonized this region till 1739. There is a little difference between Samvedi and Kadodi. Kado's trace their origin from Samvedi Bramhins, Goans and Portuguese due to their inter communal marriages. Christianity in Vasai dates back to the 16th century. The churches built by Portuguese in the 16th century are still being used by Christians today as well. Official status With the exception of Marathi and Goan Konkani, the languages have no official status. Most are considered to be a dialect of one of the larger local languages. Goan Konkani is the official language of the Indian state of Goa, Marathi of Maharashtra, and both are also among India's national languages.

There is also a GGH signature scheme. The Goldreich‚ÄìGoldwasser‚ÄìHalevi (GGH) cryptosystem makes use of the fact that the closest vector problem can be a hard problem. This system was published in 1997 by Oded Goldreich, Shafi Goldwasser, and Shai Halevi, and uses a trapdoor one-way function that is relying on the difficulty of lattice reduction. The idea included in this trapdoor function is that, given any basis for a lattice, it is easy to generate a vector which is close to a lattice point, for example taking a lattice point and adding a small error vector. But to return from this erroneous vector to the original lattice point a special basis is needed. The GGH encryption scheme was cryptanalyzed in 1999 by Phong Q. Nguyen.  Operation  GGH involves a private key and a public key. The private key is a basis B of a lattice L with good properties (such as short nearly orthogonal vectors) and a unimodular matrix U. The public key is another basis of the lattice L of the form B'=UB. For some chosen M, the message space consists of the vector (m_1,..., m_n) in the range -M .  Encryption  Given a message m = (m_1,..., m_n), error e, and a public key B' compute : v = \\\\sum m_i b_i' In matrix notation this is : v=m\\\\cdot B'. Remember m consists of integer values, and b' is a lattice point, so v is also a lattice point. The ciphertext is then : c=v+e=m \\\\cdot B' + e  Decryption  To decrypt the cyphertext one computes : c \\\\cdot B^{-1} = (m\\\\cdot B^\\\\prime +e)B^{-1} = m\\\\cdot U\\\\cdot B\\\\cdot B^{-1} + e\\\\cdot B^{-1} = m\\\\cdot U + e\\\\cdot B^{-1} The Babai rounding technique will be used to remove the term e \\\\cdot B^{-1} as long as it is small enough. Finally compute : m = m \\\\cdot U \\\\cdot U^{-1} to get the messagetext. Example Let L \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^2 be a lattice with the basis B and its inverse B^{-1} : B= \\\\begin{pmatrix} 7 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3 \\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} and B^{-1}= \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{7} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} With : U = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\\\ 3 &5\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} and : U^{-1} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 5 & -3 \\\\ -3 &2\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} this gives : B' = U B = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 14 & 9 \\\\ 21 & 15 \\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix} Let the message be m = (3, -7) and the error vector e = (1, -1). Then the ciphertext is : c = m B'+e=(-104, -79).\\\\, To decrypt one must compute : c B^{-1} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{-104}{7}, \\\\frac{-79}{3}\\\\right). This is rounded to (-15, -26) and the message is recovered with : m= (-15, -26) U^{-1} = (3, -7).\\\\,  Security of the scheme  1999 Nguyen showed at the Crypto conference that the GGH encryption scheme has a flaw in the design of the schemes. Nguyen showed that every ciphertext reveals information about the plaintext and that the problem of decryption could be turned into a special closest vector problem much easier to solve than the general CVP.

In 1996 he introduced the Sociology of the World Wide Web (web sociology) as a web science, based on the principles of social informatics. He earned the PhD (mag.art.) degree in sociology in 1970 with a dissertation on social time, where he developed a theory of Relative Social Time with tense logic as method. In 1974 he was appointed assistant professor in sociology at the University of Oslo, where he was employed until his retirement in 2004. Through a series of studies of health risk factors in Norwegian industries and social services in 1970-1990 he developed a system for detection, prediction and prevention of supermortality in workplaces. From a global historical viewpoint Stein Br√•ten must be considered as the founder of the science of social informatics, which he originally called \\"socioinformatics\\" (Norwegian: sosioinformatikk).

LECs are usually composed of two metal electrodes connected by (e.g. sandwiching) an organic semiconductor containing mobile ions. Aside from the mobile ions, their structure is very similar to that of an organic light-emitting diode (OLED). LECs have most of the advantages of OLEDs, as well as additional ones: * The device is less dependent on the difference in work function of the electrodes. Consequently, the electrodes can be made of the same material (e.g. gold). Similarly, the device can still be operated at low voltages. * Recently developed materials such as graphene or a blend of carbon nanotubes and polymers have been used as electrodes, eliminating the need for using indium tin oxide for a transparent electrode. * The thickness of the active electroluminescent layer is not critical for the device to operate. This means that: *LECs can be printed with relatively inexpensive printing processes (where control over film thicknesses can be difficult). *In a planar device configuration, internal device operation can be observed directly. There are two distinct types of LECs, those based on inorganic transition metal complexes (iTMC) or light emitting polymers. iTMC devices are often more efficient than their LEP based counterparts due to the emission mechanism being phosphorescent rather than fluorescent. While electroluminescence had been seen previously in similar devices, the invention of the polymer LEC is attributed to Pei et al. Since then, numerous research groups and a few companies have worked on improving and commercializing the devices. In 2012 the first inherently stretchable LEC using an elastomeric emissive material (at room temperature) was reported. Dispersing an ionic transition metal complex into an elastomeric matrix enables the fabrication of intrinsically stretchable light-emitting devices that possess large emission areas (‚àº175 mm2) and tolerate linear strains up to 27% and repetitive cycles of 15% strain. This work demonstrates the suitability of this approach to new applications in conformable lighting that require uniform, diffuse light emission over large areas. In 2012 fabrication of organic light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) using a roll-to-roll compatible process under ambient conditions was reported. In 2017, a new design approach developed by a team of Swedish researchers promised to deliver substantially higher efficiency: 99.2 cd A‚àí1 at a bright luminance of 1910 cd m‚àí2.

It was assigned to the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, part of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. The regiment was established with twenty-six officers, 523 other ranks and 600 horses. It was formed from three squadrons belonging to pre war Territorial Force regiments: the 3rd (Auckland) Mounted Rifles, the 4th (Waikato) Mounted Rifles and the 11th (North Auckland) Mounted Rifles. It included a small headquarters and, until 1916, a Maxim machine-gun section. During the war, the Maxim guns were withdrawn but the regiment's fire-power increased until each squadron had four Hotchkiss machine-guns, one per troop, by the end of the war. As mounted infantry, the regiment rode into battle on their horses but were expected to dismount and fight on foot. The regiment fought predominantly against the forces of the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Their first engagement was in the Gallipoli Campaign between May and December 1915, during which they participated in the largest battle of that theatre at Chunuk Bair and the fighting for Hill 60. Evacuated to Egypt, the regiment took part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign from 1916 to 1918. Their early battles included Romani, Gaza and Beersheba. Later in the war, they were part of the force that occupied the Jordan Valley and took part in the raids on Amman and Es Salt. Their final wartime operation was in connection with the capture of the Turkish Fourth Army. During the four years of war, the regiment sustained 334 dead from all causes and 555 wounded, several of those more than once. After the war, the regiment played a minor role in the Egyptian Revolution of 1919 before it was disbanded in June 1919. History=Formation Auckland Mounted Rifles marching along Upper Symonds Street, Auckland, September 1914. The Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment was raised in August 1914, at the start of the First World War, from the region around Auckland on the North Island of New Zealand.Nicol 1921, p.2 The regiment was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Ernest Randolph Mackesy, and comprised a headquarters, a machine-gun section and three squadrons formed from Territorial Force regiments. The New Zealand Territorial Force included a compulsory training system and New Zealand's four military districts were required to supply a mounted regiment for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. To meet that obligation, each of the Territorial Force regiments provided a squadron, which kept its own regimental badges and traditions.Waite 1919, p.6 The squadrons for the Auckland Mounted Rifles came from the 3rd (Auckland) Mounted Rifles, the 4th (Waikato) Mounted Rifles and the 11th (North Auckland) Mounted Rifles.Powles 1922, p.3 Upon its establishment, the regiment comprised twenty-six officers and 523 other ranks, who were mounted on 528 riding horses, seventy-four draught horses and six pack horses. Each squadron of 158 men had a field headquarters and four troops. Although the regiment used horses, they were not cavalry but mounted infantry, and were expected to ride to the battlefield, dismount and fight as traditional infantry.Stack 2011, p.1883 The regiment was assigned to the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, serving alongside two other mounted infantry regimentsthe Wellington Mounted Rifles and the Canterbury Mounted Rifles.Kinloch 2005, p.4 Embarkation What remained of August and most of September was taken up with training, until the regiment received embarkation orders and set sail from Auckland on 23 September. The unescorted transport ships returned to the same harbour the next morning, believing two German cruisers, were in the area. The troops disembarked and it was not until 11 October that they sailed again.Nicol 1921, pp.8‚Äì9 This time they reached Wellington on 14 October. Two days later, now part of a large convoy of transport ships, four warships and 9,000 men, they sailed again for an \\"unknown destination\\".Nicol 1921, pp.10‚Äì11 Stopping at Hobart, the New Zealand convoy waited until 1 November to be joined by an Australian contingent, then thirty-eight ships set sail, heading north.Nicol 1921, p.14 With only brief halts to re-coal at Colombo on 15 November and Aden on 24 November, the convoy entered the Suez Canal on 1 December. Four days later, the regiment disembarked at Alexandria.Nicol 1921, pp.16‚Äì20 They entrained for Cairo and established their camp on the edge of the desert, in the suburb of Zeitoun. In the following months, the regiment practised their horsemanship, conducted small arms and bayonet training, and learned to construct trenches.Nicol 1921, p.21 Gallipoli ANZAC beach-head area defended by the brigade In May 1915, the regiment, with the rest of the brigade, was warned to prepare to embark for the Gallipoli Campaign, serving in a dismounted role as part of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC). A rear party remained behind to look after the horses while twenty- six officers and 482 other ranks boarded the transport ships.Nicol 1921, pp.28‚Äì29 On 12 May they landed at ANZAC Cove and the next day took over from the Royal Naval Brigade in the front line. The regiment was responsible for the section of the front known as \\"Walker's Top\\" and \\"The Nek\\", opposite what was possibly the strongest Turkish position, only away.Nicol 1921, p.35 They defeated their first Turkish attack on 18/19 May, when their position was subjected to small arms fire from midnight until 03:00. Then the Turkish troops assaulted \\"Walker's Top\\" and \\"Quinn's Post\\". The attack lasted an hour, and cost the regiment twenty-two dead and twenty-seven wounded, but they held the position. On 22 May they were relieved by the 9th Light Horse Regiment, and moved to the rear.Nicol 1921, p.54 In June the regiment repeatedly moved between front and rear area positions, and was not involved in a major battle. With Mackesy ill, Major Frank Chapman arrived from Egypt on 25 May to assume command of the regiment. He was followed five days later by one officer and 107 other ranks as reinforcements.Nicol 1921, p.61 He was followed, five days later, by one officer and 107 other ranks of reinforcements. The situation remained the same in July, and another two officers and ten men arrived to replace casualties.Nicol 1921, pp.42‚Äì45 Remnants of the regiment after the Battle of Hill 60 August saw the regiment involved in the largest engagement of the campaign, at Chunuk Bair. After successfully capturing a Turkish position at \\"Old No.3 Post\\" on 6 August, they fought off several counter- attacks, until 9 August, with a strength of only sixty-six men from the 310 who started the battle, they were withdrawn to a rear area.Wilkie 191, p.151Nicol 1921, p.75 Their casualties were fifty-seven dead, 144 wounded and twenty-seven missing in action. On 23 August those survivors with the Wellington Mounted Rifles returned to the front line and four days later took part in the fighting around Hill 60. Their assault began at 17:00 and the regiment, with the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, captured the Turkish front line. The Wellington Mounted Rifles and Otago Mounted Rifles, following up, passed beyond the regiment to capture the Turkish reserve line. All four regiments suffered heavy casualties and had to fight off several counter-attacks. On 29 August the regiment was relieved and moved to a safer area; their casualties during the battle amounted to thirty-eight dead, and sixty-five wounded.Nicol 1921, pp.81‚Äì84 Early in September the regiment, now five officers and eighty- three men, were moved back into the front line at \\"Cheshire Ridge\\". They were relieved on 12 September and left Gallipoli the next day for the rest camp on the island of Lemnos, where they were joined by three officers and 216 other ranks as reinforcements on 5 October. Three days later, James Neil McCarroll assumed command of the regiment on temporary promotion to lieutenant- colonel,Nicol 1921, pp.85‚Äì86 while Mackesy was temporarily commander of the brigade. On 10 November the regiment, now ten officers and 286 other ranks, returned to Gallipoli, to prepare defences at \\"Waterfall Gully\\". Three days later, another sixty-six reinforcements arrived and moved into the front line at \\"Gloucester Hill\\". On 14 December the regiment left for Lemnos again. They remained on the island until 22 December, when they sailed for Egypt. Disembarking four days later, they returned to their previous camp at Zeitoun. Mackesy returned to command the regiment on 27 December.Nicol 1921, pp.87‚Äì91 Sinai The regiment spent its first month back in Egypt training. Then, once more back up to full establishment, it moved forward to defend the Suez Canal in the area of the Great Bitter Lake.Nicol 1921, pp.95‚Äì96 At the same time, it also lost some of its veterans, including those who were wounded and convalescing in England, when several men were transferred to the infantry and artillery on the Western Front.Nicol 1921, pp.97‚Äì98 Northern Sinai Desert In March the regiment, still part of the brigade, was assigned to the newly formed ANZAC Mounted Division.Powles 1922, p.12 Then on 23 April the regiment was ordered to move into the Sinai Desert to counter a Turkish attack against the British yeomanry at Katia.Powles 1922, p.7 The following week the whole brigade relieved the 2nd Light Horse Brigade at Romani.Nicol 1921, p.99 The defeated Turkish troops had withdrawn east around to Salmana and the brigade was ordered to attack those positions.Nicol 1921, p.102 On 30 May the Auckland Mounted Rifles moved in advance of the brigade, circling around to get into a position to the south-south-east of Salmana. By 04:45 the regiment was ready and the attack started. They galloped towards the Turkish position on a mound, defended by around 200‚Äì300 men. Reaching the base of the mound, they dismounted and charged uphill with bayonets fixed. The defenders withdrew, pursued by the 3rd Squadron until Turkish reinforcements appeared and the squadron rejoined the regiment. Turkish casualties in the assault are unknown, but the regiment had only one man wounded.Nicol 1921, pp.102‚Äì103 The regiment now lost its Maxim machine-gun section; the guns were withdrawn to help form the brigade Machine-Gun Squadron.Powles 1922, p.5 They were replaced with three Lewis guns, one per squadron.Gullett 1923, p.120 The loss of the section reduced the regiment's establishment to twenty-four officers and 499 other ranks.Powles 1922, p.6 Romani At the end of July, the 3rd Squadron was sent to patrol to the south near the Nagid well, observing the left flank of a Turkish force crossing the Sinai.Nicol 1921, p.106 On 1 August patrols from the 11th Squadron were sent east of Dueidar, to the En Nuss and Nagid wells, as a defence force and to expand the wells to support a brigade. On 3 August the rest of the regiment moved to Dueidar. At that time, a Turkish force occupied Mount Royston at Romani. As a result, the regiment was ordered to rejoin the brigade, and by 11:30 they were observing around 2,000 Turkish troops on Mount Royston.Nicol 1921, pp.107‚Äì108Powles 1922, p.31 For the next thirty minutes the regiment was bombed by Turkish artillery, when a brigade attack was ordered. The 3rd Squadron, supported by Lewis guns from the machine-gun sections, was positioned in the centre of the line between the Canterbury Mounted Rifles and a British yeomanry regiment. The advance forced the Turkish outposts to withdraw. By 16:45, using the cover available, the regiment drew close enough to charge the Turkish defences, capturing 250 prisoners and a field hospital. All together the brigade took 1,000 prisoners and a mountain artillery battery.Nicol 1921, pp.108‚Äì109 The regiment's casualties were two dead and six wounded. Early the next day the NZMRB moved towards Katia, with the intention of attacking a Turkish gun emplacement. The brigade positioned itself between the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on the left and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade on the right. Taking the lead, the regiment advanced close enough by 14:30 to charge the position on horseback, then dismounted and continued the attack on foot, all in the face of heavy rifle and machine-gun fire. No progress was made and they spent the rest of the day returning fire from cover. The engagement cost the regiment one dead and six wounded.Nicol 1921, pp.111‚Äì112 That night the regiment bivouacked at Katib Gannit and returned to the site of the battle the next day, 6 August, but the Turkish army had withdrawn eastwards. The brigade was ordered to advance until contact was regained with the Turkish force, which they located around 12:00, to the east of Oghratina. The regiment remained in contact all day, without suffering any casualties. They also located a telephone wire that the withdrawing Turks had failed to disconnect, enabling them to monitor the German and Turkish command issuing orders.Nicol 1921, pp.113‚Äì114 Abd Men from the regiment leaving their camp at El Arish The next day the brigade became the division reserve, so the regiment had a day of rest. On the following day, 8 August, they advanced again. By then, Oghratina was unoccupied. Later that day reconnaissance patrols located the Turkish force around west of the well at Abd.Nicol 1921, p.115 After halting overnight, the regiment led the NZMRB at 04:30 to attack the Turkish position. By 05:15 the regiment made contact with the Turkish outposts and advanced on foot towards the main Turkish defences, under covering fire from the Royal Horse Artillery (RHA). The regiment had the 3rd Squadron on the left, and two troops of the 11th Squadron and a machine-gun section on the right. Their right flank was supposed to be covered by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, but it had failed to arrive. In consequence the regiment had to extend its lines to cover the open flank, so two troops from the 4th Squadron were sent there. Things were also not going well on the other flank. At 11:20 the Canterbury Mounted Rifles were forced to retire. Then, just before midday, two Turkish battalions of about 1,100 men attacked the regiment. Still supported by the RHA, the brigade held its positions. For the next three and a half hours, the brigade was subjected to a heavy artillery bombardment. This was followed by another attack by three Turkish battalions. Holding out until 16:15 the regiment was then ordered to pull back. The day's fighting cost the regiment twelve dead and twenty-one wounded.Nicol 1921, pp.116‚Äì118 Magdhaba Larger scale map of the northern Sinai Desert. With Maghdaba to the west and Gaza to the east of the Egyptian- Palestine border. The next three months were spent on reconnaissance patrols and manning observation posts until 20 December, when the advance east recommenced, with the regiment forming the vanguard for the ANZAC Mounted Division. Travelling overnight, they reached El Arish by dawn, which had been evacuated by the Turkish forces.Nicol 1921, p.125Powles 1922 p.49 Magdhaba, with its 2,000-man garrison, was to the south-east, on the Wadi El Arish. At 10:30 on 22 December, the 3rd Squadron was sent along the wadi, in advance of the division, to determine whether the well at Lahfan could support the brigade. The brigade, leaving El Arish at midnight, followed the squadron. By daylight the division had surrounded Magdhaba. In the ensuing fighting, the village was captured after a bayonet charge in the late afternoon. The regiment, being held in reserve, took no part in the battle, but was afterwards left in charge of the village, clearing the dead and collecting war materials. It then returned to El Arish on Christmas Day.Nicol 1921, pp.124‚Äì127Powles 1922, p.50 Palestine=Rafa On 8 January 1917, the ANZAC Mounted Division headed out for their next objective, the police post at Rafa, to the east on the Egyptian-Palestinian border. Reaching Sheik Zowaiid at 22:00, the regiment rested for three hours. At dawn the regiment surrounded the Bedouin village Shokh El Sufi, south of Rafa. One of the inhabitants shot and killed one of the men. Another was knocked unconscious when hit on the head with a sword. Both of the Bedouins escaped on the troopers' horses.Nicol 1921.pp.129‚Äì130Powles 1922, p.65 section of the Auckland Mounted Rifles At 06:00, the regiment crossed the border into Palestine.Powles 1922, p.70 Moving out of the desert, the firmer ground made it easier for horse and wheeled transport. Forty-five minutes later, the regiment was located behind a ridge line observing the Turkish defences, which consisted of trenches and redoubts, with a good field of fire to their front. At 09:00 the brigade was ordered to move around to attack the position from the right flank, while covering the area north to the Mediterranean Sea. At 09:30 the attack started. Galloping forward for about , the regiment was subjected to Turkish artillery fire. When they got within from the Turkish lines, they dismounted and advanced on foot with the 3rd and 4th Squadrons leading and the 11th Squadron in reserve. On the right were the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, on the left the 1st Light Horse Brigade; the Wellington Mounted Rifles were the brigade reserve. At midday, the complete brigade attacked the Green Knoll redoubt. The 3rd Squadron, unable to make any progress, held its position while the 11th Squadron moved around to the right of the 4th Squadron. By 15:00 the 3rd Squadron was able to move forward again and at 16:00 the regiment was preparing to charge the position. Then the division received word that Turkish reinforcements were approaching. That and the loss of daylight convinced Major-General Harry Chauvel, commanding the division, to order a withdrawal. However, the order never reached the brigade, which had fixed bayonets and charged the remaining to the Turkish trenches. They captured the first trench line, and the defenders started to surrender. Seeing what was happening, the remainder of the division returned to assist and the position was captured. The regiment's casualties for the battle were seven dead and forty-one wounded.Nicol 1921, pp.130‚Äì134Powles 1922, pp.71‚Äì77 Gaza At 02:30 on 26 March, the regiment set out from Dier El Belah towards Gaza. The division was to circle the town, cutting off any escape route east and provide a blocking force to stop Turkish reinforcements, while the 53rd (Welsh) Division and a brigade of the 54th (East Anglian) Division carried out a frontal assault. Positioned at the Humra mound in the east with the 4th and 11th Squadrons, the regiment was assigned to watch for Turkish reinforcement coming from Huj. The main attack was not progressing well, so the brigade, along with the rest of the division, was ordered to attack Gaza. Still watching out for Turkish reinforcements, the regiment was held in reserve. The brigade had made good progress and was inside the town when it was ordered to withdraw. Less the 4th Squadron, which was the division's rearguard, the regiment had returned to Dier El Belah by early the next day.Nicol, pp.138‚Äì139Powles 1922, pp.84‚Äì95 On 3 April the squadrons were issued Hotchkiss machine-guns, on a scale of one per troop, which replaced the regiment's three Lewis guns.Nicol 1921, p.140 The second British attempt to take Gaza would be on 17 April, but the day before the brigade moved to Hareira, providing flank protection and preventing Turkish reinforcement from that direction. The regiment reached Shellal at 03:00, where they stopped to water their horses. At dawn hostile aircraft appeared overhead, which were engaged by the 11th Squadron, forcing them to fly at a higher altitude. By 09:00 the regiment was positioned overlooking Hareira, Sheria, and the Gaza-Beersheba rail line. Several times during the day they were machine gunned by hostile aircraft, but no casualties were sustained. That night at 22:00, as ordered, they returned to Shellal.Nicol 1921, pp.142‚Äì143 Lieutenant-Colonel James Neil McCarroll, November 1918 The next day the regiment returned to their previous task of flank protection. At midday the 3rd and 11th Squadrons were located along the ridge south-east of El Buggar, forcing the Turkish observation posts to retire. The day was almost a replica of the previous one and the regiment was back at Shellal at 21:30. Instead of resting overnight, they moved to El Mendur, arriving there at 06:00 on 19 April. The division was now required to be more aggressive, to draw the Turkish forces towards them, because of the lack of progress by the force attacking Gaza. The 3rd Squadron was detailed as a guard force for the division's artillery, accompanying them to Atawineh. The squadron moved into the front line, losing one dead and seventeen wounded by the time it withdrew at 20:00. The rest of the regiment was held in reserve, having two men wounded during an aircraft attack. By the end of the day, the second attempt to take Gaza was called off, the defences being to strong for a frontal assault.Nicol 1921, pp.143‚Äì145Powles 1922, pp.99‚Äì105 Instead of withdrawing, the British remained in a forward line of trenches and redoubts. The regiment positioned itself around Karim Abu El Hiseia, on the Wadi Ghuzze. McCarroll assumed command of the regiment again, Mackesy being appointed as the administrator of the Khan Yunus-Deir and the Belah region.Nicol 1921, p.145 For the next few months patrol duty was interspersed with occupying the front line and training.Nicol 1921, pp.146‚Äì151 Beersheba At 17:00 on 25 October the regiment, located around from Beersheba, started to moved forward. Its first objective, south-east at Esani, was reached at 01:00 on 26 October. Here they rested for two days before setting out again, travelling another to Asluj to the south of Beersheba. Waiting until the next night at 18:00, they started north to attack Beersheba, the first along a metalled road. Then they followed the Wadi Imshash for the next , stopping at 02:00 while the Canterbury Mounted Rifles reconnoitred a suspected Turkish post. The night march started again an hour later. By daylight the brigade was positioned to south of the Beersheba- Bir Arara Road, to the south-east of the high Saba hill, with the regiment being the brigade reserve.Nicol 1921, pp.155‚Äì156 Sketch of the Saba assault At 09:00 the regiment and the Somerset Battery RHA were ordered to attack Saba, to the east of Beersheba, positioned between the Canterbury Mounted Rifles on their right and the 3rd Light Horse Regiment on their left. The 11th Squadron, leading, advanced up a wadi under machine-gun fire, but there was plenty of cover for the men and horses. The squadron dismounted from the Turkish front line and continued on foot. The 3rd and 4th Squadrons meanwhile had rode to within to the north, then dismounted to continue on foot. Advancing by troops, covered by their machine-guns, good progress was made.Nicol 1921, pp.156‚Äì157Powles 1922, p.138 At 14:10 the regiment was ordered to assault the position. Thirty minutes later, a hill east of Saba was taken with sixty prisoners and three machine-guns. A short while later, Saba itself was captured with 132 prisoners and four machine-guns. However, the regiment had six dead and twenty-two wounded, including a squadron leader.Nicol 1921, pp.157‚Äì158Powles 1922, p.139 The regiment remained, consolidating Saba until 2 November while the brigade's other regiment and the 4th Squadron were fighting a Turkish cavalry force. On 4 November the brigade moved to Wadi El Sultan. The next day the 4th Squadron was tasked to support the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, advancing against a Turkish position away. The Turks counter-attacked the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, so the 3rd Squadron was moved forward to support them and the attack was defeated. The regiment lost one man dead and four wounded during the day's fighting. While the rest of the brigade retired to the west, the regiment remained at the front manning observation posts until 11 November, when they were relieved by the British Westminster Dragoons.Nicol 1921, pp.159‚Äì160Powles 1922, pp.141‚Äì142 Ayun Kara The regiment left Beersheba to rejoin the brigade, then had to move across the front to the British left flank. Travelling through the night, at 07:30 they had reached Jemmaleh, where they rested for two hours. Continuing their advance, they reached Hesy at 13:30, Bureir at 14:30, then finally Hamama, where they established a rest camp. The march was difficult for men and horses, with virtually no food or water. The horses were taken to the sea to drink. Their supplies finally caught up with the regiment and that night they moved again to a new camp north of Sukereir. The next day the regiment rejoined the brigade, outside the village of Ayun Kara.Nicol 1921, pp.161‚Äì162 Battle of Ayun Kara At 11:00 on 14 November the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, the brigade vanguard, encountered Turkish observation posts. The brigade ordered an attack on the main Turkish defences. The regiment was positioned to cover the left flank. Advancing by troops they came under machine-gun fire. The 3rd Squadron was dispatched to occupy the high ground on the regiment's right while the other squadrons took cover. Then a force of Turkish cavalry appeared to their left. McCarroll sent the 11th Squadron to check on their dispositions and numbers. However, the squadron encountered heavy rifle and machine-gun fire and could not move forward. To assist them, two troops from the 4th Squadron, were ordered to charge on horseback. The two troops captured the position and continued forward, occupying the high ground on the left in front of the Wellington Mounted Rifles. The 3rd Squadron, in reserve, provided covering fire as the 11th Squadron moved forward alongside the 4th on their left. Covered by the 4th Squadron, the 11th Squadron moved forward. At 14:15 the advance troops of the 11th Squadron located, in an orange grove, a Turkish concentration of troops that counter-attacked the regiment. McCarroll, who had kept up with his forward line of troops, ordered the rest of the regiment, including headquarters troops, to move up in support of the 11th Squadron. The 3rd Squadron galloped forward, dismounting just behind the front line, and engaged the Turkish attack with enfilade fire, forcing the Turks to retire.Nicol 1921, pp.162‚Äì163 At 14:45, covered by an artillery barrage and machine-gun fire, the Turkish troops counter-attacked again. The regiment's machine gunners returned fire and for a short time the battle became a machine-gun engagement. During this time the Wellington Mounted Rifles, to the right, had occupied a prominent hill, but were under heavy fire. To support them, the 3rd Squadron sent two troops to engage their opponents, which they caught in the bottom of a valley, with enfilade fire. Then in front of the regiment a fresh Turkish battalion was sent to assault them. In some places, the Turkish force got close enough to throw hand grenades into the regiment's defences. These killed or wounded all those defending a small hill, which was then occupied by the Turkish troops, bringing indirect fire onto the rest of the regiment's positions, which by now were becoming untenable. At first, messengers sent to the 4th Squadron asking for assistance failed to get through. Eventually the squadron received the message and charged across the open ground, recapturing the hill. This brought the rest of the Turkish line into range of the squadron's guns. Confronted by the new threat, the Turkish troops retired back to their starting point. McCarroll was ordering a regiment attack on the orange grove when he was wounded in the neck and shoulder, forcing Major Henry Whitehorn to assume temporary command of the regiment. By then it was getting dark and the only Turkish offensive action was an artillery bombardment. Instead of attacking, the regiment spent the rest of the day evacuating the wounded and strengthening their lines. Their casualties during the battle were fifteen dead and seventy-four wounded.Nicol 1921, pp.163‚Äì165Powles 1922, pp.145‚Äì151 The next morning it was discovered that Ayun Kara had been evacuated by the Turkish troops.Nicol 1921, p.166 River Auja On 15 November the brigade moved forward again to Rishon LeZion village south of the port of Jaffa. The next day the regiment moved forward alone and established a line of observation posts between Beit Dejan and Safiriyeh, just under from Jaffa. Reconnaissance patrols discovered that Jaffa was not occupied by any Turkish forces, so the 3rd Squadron and the Canterbury Mounted Rifles moved in to provide a garrison, while the rest of the regiment and the Wellington Mounted Rifles returned to Ayun Kara. The regiment moved further north on 18 November and over the next few days carried out a reconnaissance of the River Auja.Powles 1922, p.159 On 27 November the brigade secured a bridgehead over the river. To help defend the crossing, the 3rd and 11th Squadrons dug in on the northern bank. The next day, at 14:45, the squadrons were attacked and by 17:45, first the horse holders and the regiment's mounts were sent back across the river. The squadrons were forced to retire to the lines of the supporting infantry. By 20:00 the entire British position was under threat and had to withdraw back across to the south of the river. The regiment's casualties were one dead, one missing and nineteen wounded, including Whitehorn. Command of the regiment temporarily passed to Major Duncan Munro.Nicol 1921, pp.168‚Äì171Powles 1922, pp.161‚Äì165 After the battle at the River Auja, the brigade camped to the south-east of Sarona, out of range of the Turkish artillery. The regiment, having only sixteen officers and 375 other ranks left effective, spent the time building up its strength in men and horses.Nicol 1921, p.172 In the last month the regiment had lost twenty-seven dead and eighty-eight wounded, sixty-one had to be evacuated to the rear as they were ill and two men were missing. Whitehorn returned on 16 December to resume temporary command of the regiment. Two days later the regiment returned to Jaffa and came under command of the 52nd (Lowland) Division. Then on 20 December the Lowland Division assaulted the River Auja and the regiment patrolled north of the river, supporting the division until 25 December, when they rejoined the NZMRB.Nicol 1921, pp.175‚Äì176 Jordan valley=Jericho McCarroll, recovered from his wounds, resumed command of the regiment on 15 January 1918. It was still understrength, with only twenty-two officers and 486 other ranks. Auckland Mounted Rifles camp in the Jordan Valley In February the ANZAC Mounted Division was ordered to cross over to the British right flank, to conduct operations in the Jordan Valley by first capturing Jericho.Nicol 1921, p.177 By 19 February the regiment was east of Bethlehem and at 09:30 started toward Jericho along what was described as \\"little more than a goat track\\".Nicol 1921, p.179 At times the track was so steep that the men had to dismount and lead their horses by hand. After stopping overnight, the regiment set out again as the vanguard at 04:30, moving in single file. Soon afterwards, Turkish guns opened fire on them from two hills, Kaneitera and Kalimun, which could dominate their approach. Upon reaching the valley bottom, the regiment spread out to provide a more difficult target. Moving forward under Turkish artillery and machine-gun fire, the regiment galloped from cover to cover by troops.Nicol 1921, pp.181‚Äì182Powles 1922, pp.171‚Äì179 This continued until around midday when the 11th Squadron got close enough to assault a Turkish position on the right of the valley. At the same time, the 3rd and 4th Squadrons were advancing in the centre and to the left. Elsewhere the Australian light horse brigades and British infantry were having similar problems. Eventually the British secured a position that allowed then to bring fire onto the Turkish defences in front of the regiment, forcing them to retire further up the Kalimun hill. The regiment's horse holders brought the mounts forward and the regiment charged the position on horseback. The Turkish forces retired, but kept the hill now occupied by the regiment under an artillery barrage.Nicol 1921, pp.182‚Äì183 The next day there was no trace of any Turkish forces and the advance continued. At times, this was again only possible by moving in single file, leaving the brigade spread along of tracks. At 09:00 the regiment moved out of the hills and into the Jordan Valley, just north of the Dead Sea and south of Jericho, about from the River Jordan. The time it had taken the NZMRB to negotiate the track allowed the Turkish forces to retire to the east bank of the river by a pontoon bridge at Goraniyeh. While the Australians captured Jericho, the regiment established a camp in the valley under the Mount of Temptation, north of Jericho. The brigade was then made responsible for guarding the river from the Dead Sea to the Ghoraniyeh bridge.Nicol 1921, pp.183‚Äì184Powles 1922, pp.181‚Äì183 However, on 22 February the rest of the NZMRB returned to Ayun Kara, leaving the regiment in the valley under command of the 60th (London) Division, tasked to carry out mounted patrols of the river.Nicol 1921, pp.184‚Äì185Powles 1922, p.183 Amman raid The regiment was next involved in a raid on the village of Amman to the east of the River Jordan. The force assembled for the operation comprised the ANZAC Mounted Division, the 60th (London) Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade.Powles 1922, p.190 Reconnaissance patrols had discovered that the river was not fordable and they would have to construct bridges to get across. Three viable sites had been selected at Makhadet (which means ford), Hajlah north of the Dead Sea, and Ghoraniyeh. Two crossings were to be constructed. At Hajlaha, pontoon bridge made from steel would be assembled for the mounted troops. The second crossing point, at Ghoraniyeh where there was already a damaged pontoon bridge, would have three bridges for the 60th Division: a normal pontoon bridge, a barrel bridge, and an infantry bridge.Nicol 1921, p.189 Crossing the River Jordan by pontoon bridge At midnight on 21 March, the infantry tried to cross at Ghoraniyeh, however the river was flowing too fast for their swimmers to get across. At Hajlah they had more success and a raft was constructed to ferry men and materials across. By dawn the Turkish had discovered them crossing and were engaging the crossing infantry with machine-gun fire. Engineers had finished the pontoon bridge by 08:10 and more troops were crossing, but their exploitation was restricted to around from the river line as they were confronted by strong Turkish defences.Nicol 1921, pp.190‚Äì191Powles 1922, pp.193‚Äì194 At 05:00 on 23 March the regiment, the first mounted force, began to cross the river. They were passing beyond the infantry forward troops by 07:30. Two troops from the 11th Squadron were dispatched to the east and another north-east. One troop, twenty men, encountered a force of sixty Turkish cavalry and charged them, armed only with rifles and bayonets. The troop killed twenty cavalrymen and captured seven, in exchange for the death of one man, the troop leader who had ordered the charge. The troop sent north had forced a machine-gun post covering the river to withdraw, but the gun and its crew were later captured by men from the 4th Squadron. While this move had been progressing, the troop of the 11th Squadron had been sent north from the crossing.Nicol 1921, pp.191‚Äì194 At the same time the 3rd and 4th Squadrons galloped north to take the Turkish defenders at Ghoraniyeh from the rear. At 09:00 the leading troops, without loss, captured the first Turkish outpost with seventeen prisoners. One troop of the 3rd Squadron dismounted and captured two machine-gun posts overlooking the crossing, which allowed the rest of the squadron to drive off the remaining defenders. While the 3rd Squadron concentrated on the crossing the 4th Squadron was ordered to gallop and capture the village of Shunet Nimrin, but were unable to approach the village when confronted by heavy artillery fire. The day's battle cost the regiment one dead and two wounded. By that night the bridge at Ghoraniyeh was completed and the remainder of the ANZAC Mounted Division were crossing at Hajlah.Powles 1922, pp.193‚Äì197 Amman with Hill 3039 in the background The next morning, when the NZMRB had crossed the river, McCarroll was given command of the vanguard, comprising the regiment, a squadron from the Canterbury Mounted Rifles and the Hong Kong and Singapore Mountain Artillery Battery. Progress was slow along the steep tracks and they had to camp in the hills that night at an altitude between .Nicol 1921, pp.195‚Äì196 During the night it started to rain, making travelling along the small tracks even harder at daylight. Because the rest of the division was having even worse problems than the brigade, they stopped at the village of Ain es Sir. During the day, they captured seven Germans and eighty-eight Turkish troops. Another problem for the regiment was the lack of supplies; their rations were stuck somewhere behind them on the track. The remainder of the division arrived during the day and the raid on Amman was planned for the next day, 27 March.Nicol 1921, pp.196‚Äì197Powles 1922, pp.197‚Äì198 At 08:00 the NZMRB set out heading south- east, the plan called for them to assault Amman from the south. The vanguard was provided by the regiment with the 4th Squadron leading. When they got within of the village, they came under a Turkish artillery barrage. At 12:00 when the regiment was from the rail line, which would be their right flank position, they turned north. Then a Turkish train arrived along the tracks from the south. The regiment's machine-gunners opened fire of it, and they were just about to charge when it continued on into Amman. By now Turkish artillery and machine-gun fire was proving effective and the regiment was unable to make any progress. Hill 3039, in front of the 3rd Squadron, was well defended with numerous machine-guns, so the 4th Squadron were sent forward to support the assault. While 11th Squadron moved right, to the higher ground, to give covering fire. At 18:00 Turkish troops mounted a counter-attack against the Canterbury Mounted Rifles on the regiment's left, but the regiment held the position. By nightfall no further progress was made and the division decided to hold onto what territory they had occupied and wait for assistance from 60th Division. The day's fighting had cost the regiment eighteen casualties. They still had not received any supplies and the rations they carried were exhausted.Nicol 1921, pp.197‚Äì199Powles 1922, pp.200‚Äì201 Plan of attack 30 March, objectives identified as \\"A\\", \\"B\\", \\"C\\", \\"D\\", and \\"E\\" That night, 27/28 March, the Turkish forces in Amman were reinforced, which again prevented the regiment from advancing. When two infantry battalions and an artillery battery arrived at 11:30 plans were made for another assault at 13:00. But still faced with heavy artillery and machine-gun fire, by 16:00 the regiment had only managed to advance onto the lower slopes of Hill 3039. The position there was untenable and the regiment was forced to withdraw to a better location that night.Nicol 1921, p.200Powles 1922, pp.202‚Äì203 The next day, 29 March, the division consolidated their positions, planning to resume the assault on 30 March. McCarroll was given command of the assault. Position \\"A\\" was their main objective. The approach route would be along a ridge line between \\"B\\" and \\"C,\\" which were to be neutralised by two troops in case the Turkish tried to intervene in the attack. Once \\"A\\" was captured, it was believed \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" would surrender.Powles 1922, p.206 The regiment and a battalion from the Imperial Camel Corps would attack point \\"A\\". The Canterbury Mounted Rifles would support the attack on the regiment's left. At 01:45 the regiment moved forward, dismounted and managed to get close enough to the first objective to charge home without being seen, capturing the first trench, five machine-guns and twenty-three prisoners. The regiment continued on, capturing the position. At daybreak Turkish troops were able to bring enfilade fire from point \\"B\\" against the regiment's positions. So 4th Squadron, with 3rd Squadron providing covering fire, mounted an attack and captured that position. At 09:30 Turkish troops were seen gathered on the north-east side of the hill. McCarroll asked for artillery support to break up their troops, but there was none available. The mountain battery, at the time, only had four rounds left. The Turkish forces attacked and managed to close on the regiment's defences before they were stopped by rifle and machine-gun fire.Nicol 1921, pp.202‚Äì205Powles 1922, pp.206‚Äì209 With no further progress being made anywhere, and the arrival of more Turkish reinforcements, a withdrawal back across the River Jordan was ordered that night. Plans were made for the wounded to leave first, then the fighting troops falling back in turn.Nichol 1921, p.206Powles 1922, p.212 McCarroll gave each unit exact times they were to retire, so they still presented a continuous line as they moved back. They withdrew without attracting the attention of the Turkish troops and at 04:00 the regiment arrived back at Ain es Sir. The brigade was designated as the force rearguard. At 16:00 a large Turkish force was reported by the Canterbury Mounted Rifles to be approaching from the north, so the regiment was sent to help. The Turkish force had come to within of the New Zealand lines, but did not attack. The next day, 1 April, the withdrawal continued and several times Turkish troops were sighted following. They eventually reached Nimrin in the Jordan Valley at 20:00 that night. The regiment's exact casualties are not documented, but the NZMRB lost thirty-eight dead, 122 wounded and had thirteen men reported missing during the raid.Nichol 1921, pp.206‚Äì210Powles 1922, pp.211‚Äì212 Es Salt raid The Auja pontoon bridge, the approach track with withdrawing troops can be seen in the background. The regiment spent most of April on patrol and guard duties to the west of the River Jordan. The Rugby football team were presented, by Lieutenant-General Harry Chauvel, commanding the Desert Mounted Corps, with the division's cup for being the champion team.Nicol 1921, pp.212‚Äì213 The second raid across the Jordan on Es Salt began on 29 April, with the brigade initially being held in reserve. The operation had similar problems as the first raid, and on 30 April the brigade was moved forward. The Wellington Mounted Rifles and Canterbury Mounted Rifles were ordered to support the assault by the infantry at Nimrin, while the regiment remained in reserve. At 09:30 the 4th Squadron was sent forward to support the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, but a Turkish artillery barrage, by at least four batteries, landed to their front, preventing them going forward. The artillery fire increased and the rest of the regiment had to retire to put the horses out of harm's way. Without making further progress that day, the regiment returned to the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead for the night. More Turkish reinforcements arrived overnight and opposition to any British advance was increasing. Eventually the regiment was ordered to gallop forward to the front line, deploying to cover along the track from Es Salt. One of the first things they observed was a party of RHA artillerymen going back without their guns, which they had been forced to abandon. The 3rd and 4th Squadrons began digging trenches, as the regiment had to hold a position covering the only way back for the 4th Light Horse Brigade, to their front. On 2 May the Australians were ordered to withdraw, reaching the regiment's position the next day. That night the regiment withdrew to a ford at Auja, where engineers were constructing a pontoon bridge. The regiment remained there alone the next day while the rest of the NZMRB returned to their previous camp near Jericho. The regiment was relieved the next day and rejoined the brigade.Nicol 1921, pp.214‚Äì216Powles 1922, pp.221‚Äì223 Summer 1918 The regiment remained in the western foothills of the Jordan Valley, based at Talat Ed Dumm, until the end of May, then moved to El Khudr, beside Bethlehem, where some men were granted leave in Port Said, and Jerusalem. In June the regiment returned to the valley, based at the Wadi Abeid, carrying out patrols and enhancing defences. At the start of July, they moved again, this time to Ain Ed Duk, relieving the Wellington Mounted Rifles. On 18 July the 1st Light Horse Brigade, to the regiment's left, was attacked by a large force of Germans. Turkish troops supporting that attack also attempted to break the regiment's line, but they were fought off. Relieved a few days later, the regiment returned to Bethlehem. Casualties during the month were all down to malaria, or other diseases, 170 men being evacuated to hospital. In August they returned to duties in the valley at Jericho, and another 109 men were evacuated to hospital during the month.Nicol 1921, pp.218‚Äì221Powles 1922, pp.231‚Äì232 Chaytor's Force In September, Chaytor, commanding the ANZAC Mounted Division, was given command of a mixed mounted and infantry force to carry out a deception plan in the Jordan Valley. The regiment helped by constructing dummy camps with dummy horse lines and increased their patrolling, with the objective of discovering the Turkish strength and positions. The rest of the army was aligned to their left flank and on 19 September started the last attack major attack of the campaign. With the Turkish forces retiring to counter the attack in the west, by 21 September the NZMRB was ordered forward, reinforced by two battalions of the British West Indies Regiment, their own Ayrshire Battery RHA and the 29th Indian Mountain Battery.Nicol 1921, pp.22‚Äì224Powles 1922, p.237 Damieh That night, 21 September, the regiment left its base at Musallabeh and headed north up the Jordan Valley. The 4th Squadron, leading, covered the first , reaching Kh Fusail and then Tel Es Ed Dhiab, with no opposition. They encountered a Turkish defence line at the Mafid Jozeleh bridge, which was captured along with twenty prisoners and two machine-guns. That night the infantry were left guarding the bridge, while the NZMRB continued advancing north to secure an important bridge at Damieh, cutting the Nablus road.Nicol 1921, pp.222‚Äì224Powles 1922, pp.246‚Äì247 The Damieh bridge, over the River Jordan, on the main road between Nablus and Es Salt. At midnight the regiment, supported by a section of the brigade machine-gun squadron, set out again, leading the brigade along the Jericho-Beisan road. The 3rd Squadron was sent ahead, after a force of Turkish troops believed to be withdrawing along the road in front of them, and to capture the Damieh bridge. The 11th Squadron remained on the road as a blocking force while the 4th Squadron headed to El Makhruk to the north-east. The 11th Squadron captured a Turkish convoy that came along the road, while the 3rd Squadron caught up with the force in front of them, capturing several prisoners. They also discovered a Turkish cavalry picket line and forced them down from the hills onto the low ground along the river towards the Damieh bridge. The 3rd Squadron, holding the high ground, was counter-attacked by infantry supported by artillery. Part of the squadron was forced to retire to a better defensive position. As reinforcements were observed arriving for the Turkish force, a regiment attack was ordered and reinforcements of their own requested. Support came from a squadron of the Canterbury Mounted Rifles and a West Indies infantry company. The regiment was around from the bridge, almost surrounding the Turkish position there. McCarroll planned the assault, with six troops and a machine-gun on the left to provide fire support. Then from left to right, less one troop in reserve, the rest of the regiment positioned itself from left to right, followed by the West Indies company, then the Canterbury Mounted Rifles squadron on the right. The attack began, supported by machine-gun and artillery fire. The Turkish line was pierced and they started to withdraw across the bridge pursued by the regiment. The bridge was secured intact, along with 350 prisoners and seven machine-guns. The regiment had four dead and one wounded. One of the West Indies soldiers was also wounded. The regiment now settled in, defending the bridge while the Canterbury Mounted Rifles squadron crossed and started clearing the far bank.Nicol 1921, pp.224‚Äì226 Es Salt again The next day the brigade crossed the bridge and at midday continued east towards Es Salt. By 17:00 the regiment was camped to the west of the town. They entered the unoccupied Es Salt on the following day, watered their horses, then continued east towards Amman as the vanguard. Passing abandoned wagons, dead men and animals, they had caught up with the Turkish rearguard by 12:00, but had to stop at the village of Suweileh to water their horses and wait for the rest of the brigade to catch up with them. That night a selected group of 100 men, commanded by Major John Herrold, were sent out across country to damage the Hedjaz rail line south of Amman. Each of the three squadrons provided an officer and thirty-three men. Their only tools were two picks, two shovels, and four spanners. The force was divided into three: one to tackle the rails and the other two to provide protection. When they found the rail line, they followed it for about . Hearing sounds of digging, they dismounted, continuing on foot until they located a group of Turks digging trenches. Part of their objective was to remain undetected, so they withdrew, leaving the Turkish force alone. They eventually located the section of track they were looking for. However, the road alongside the tracks was full of Turkish traffic. Establishing a base from the track, the rail group now crept forward to attack the tracks. Their work was first interrupted when an armoured train with trucks full of soldiers came along the rails. They were next disturbed by a mounted patrol, which passed by without observing them. They eventually removed two rails, making the tracks unusable. The group then returned to their horses and returned to the regiment at dawn. That day the value of their efforts was seen when a train was wrecked where they had broken the rails.Nicol 1921, pp,227‚Äì230Powles 1922,pp.248‚Äì252 For his command of the operation Herrold was invested as a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order. Amman again On 25 September, the same day the railway group returned, the brigade set out at 06:00 for Amman. Approaching from the north, they would be supported during the assault by the 2nd Light Horse Brigade. At 10:30 the regiment, with a machine-gun section and an artillery section, was ordered to move forward to the left of the Canterbury Mounted Rifles. The Turkish defenders were in redoubts surrounded by barbed wire. McCarroll sent a squadron to attack from the west, which came under Turkish machine-gun fire. Covered by the artillery the squadron was gradually able to advance. At 15:30 the reserve squadron galloped forward, dismounted and came under machine-gun fire. The regiment and Canterbury Mounted Rifles pushed forward. The 4th Squadron succeeded in reaching a double redoubt, but just as they were about to charge, sixty of the defenders surrendered and others withdrew along the Wadi Amman. By now the Canterbury Mounted Rifles had galloped into the town and out the other side, capturing the Turkish defences there from the rear. The battle was over and the brigade captured 1,734 prisoners, twenty-seven machine-guns, five artillery pieces, 298 horses and other military supplies. That night the regiment camped in the Wadi Amman.Nicol 1921, pp.231‚Äì233 Several days later the NZMRB was moved to the south to support the 2nd Light Horse Brigade at Ziza. The light-horsemen had taken the surrender of a large Turkish force, part of the Turkish Fourth Army, then had to defend them from the Arab tribesmen. When the brigade arrived the Australian and Turkish troops, who were still armed, were holding a perimeter facing the Arab force. The brigade's appearance resolved the situation and the Turkish troops surrendered.Nicol 1921, pp.233‚Äì234Powles 1922, pp.254‚Äì256 Post war The remaining original officers of the regiment in December 1918. Left to right; Major Walter Haeata, Lieutenant-Colonel James Mccarroll, and Lieutenant W. Stewart. In October 1918, the regiment's part in the war now over; they returned to the Jordan Valley. However many men were now struck down with malaria. In the next few days those who were able returned to Richon-le-Zion, where they established their camp. By November the regiment had eleven officers and 331 other ranks in hospital; twenty-two of those died of the disease. Only two men from the regiment had not been infected in any way.Nicol 1921, pp.235‚Äì236 The regiment remained at Richon until 18 December, carrying out military training and playing sports. Then they moved back to Rafa, where a school was established. It was discovered that before the war one of the regiment's troopers had been a schools inspector, so he was immediately promoted to major, taking charge of lessons.Nicol 1921, pp.236‚Äì238 While waiting for repatriation to New Zealand the regiment played a minor role in the 1919 Egyptian Revolution, which was a Nationalist uprising in the Nile Delta region. The regiment were reissued its equipment and sent to support the authorities, as martial law had been declared. The uprising soon ended without any major incidents. One incident the regiment had to deal with was a request from an Egyptian woman for an officer to grant her a divorce. On 22 June the regiment moved to the Demobilisation Camp at Ismailia on the Suez Canal. They boarded the transport HMT Ulimaroa and sail for New Zealand. On 30 June the regiment ceased to exist as such. Five weeks later, on 8 August, the Ulimaroa arrived at Auckland.Nicol 1921, pp.239‚Äì240 Casualties During its service, 334 men of the regiment died from all causes, either killed in action, died of wounds or disease, and two were lost at sea. Almost two thirds of those, 202 men, were killed during the seven months they fought in the Gallipoli Campaign, while 130 died during the two years of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. There were also 555 men wounded; 53 of those were unfortunate enough to have been wounded twice. The Gallipoli Campaign accounted for over half of the total number of wounded at 316 men; 22 of them were wounded twice. Then in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, there were another 239 men wounded, with 31 of those again wounded twice.Nicol 1921, pp.245‚Äì263 Many of the Gallipoli dead have no known grave. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission Chunuk Bair Cemetery, constructed on the site where the Turks buried Allied war dead after the evacuation, has 632 graves. Only ten of the men there have been identified. At the nearby Hill 60 Cemetery, which has another 788 graves, only seventy-six of the dead were identified. Honours Several men of the regiment were recognised for their service by the British Empire awards system. The two commanding officers, Mackesy and McCarroll, were invested as Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George, and as Companions of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). McCarroll also received a bar for the DSO to signify a second award. While Mackesy was also invested as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Two other men also received a DSO both majors, Herrold for the raid on the rail line at Amman and Ralph Wyman at Gallipoli. There were two civilian awards, of an Officer of the Order of the British Empire and a Member of the Order of the British Empire. The Military Cross was awarded to eight officers; two men received bars for a second award. The other ranks were awarded six Distinguished Conduct Medals, and sixteen Military Medals. There were also twenty-six men Mentioned in Dispatches for all ranks.Nicol 1921, pp.264‚Äì265 References ;Footnotes ;Citations ;Bibliography   * * Category:New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade Category:Military units and formations established in 1914 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1919 Category:Mounted infantry regiments of New Zealand in World War I Category:History of Waikato Category:History of the Auckland Region Category:1914 establishments in New Zealand ","title":"Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment"},{"id":"18675663","text":"Alicia Barrancos (born May 2, 1972) is a retired female freestyle swimmer from Argentina who represented her native country at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia.

Originating from the merger of several small Wandervogel and Scouting groups, it was one of the largest and most important associations of the B√ºndische Jugend of the Weimar Republic besides the Deutscher Pfadfinderbund and Reichsschaft Deutscher Pfadfinder. History In 1926 the DF originated from the association of the Gro√üdeutscher Pfadfinderbund (itself an association of the Bund Deutscher Neupfadfinder and Bund der Ringpfadfinder) with the Altwandervogel, Deutsche Jungenschaft, the Wandervogel, Deutscher Jungenbund and the Reichsstand, Gefolgschaft deutscher Wanderv√∂gel forming the Bund der Wanderv√∂gel und Pfadfinder.Rudolf Kniep:Jugend der Weimarer Zeit, Handbuch der Jugendverb√§nde 1919-1938. dipa- Verlag, Frankfurt am Main 1974, , pp. 75-83 In March 1927 the Bund der K√∂ngener joined; in April of the same year it was renamed to Deutsche Freischar; on October 27, 1927 the Wandervogel-M√§dchenbund joined.Werner Kindt:Die Deutsche Jugendbewegung 1920 bis 1933.

Until 1928 several smaller groups joined; at the end of 1929 the DF had 12,000 members (among them 1500 women and girls). On May 4, 1930 the DF and the Gro√üdeutscher Jugendbund (under Admiral Adolf von Trotha) united under the name Deutsche Freischar. The result was a large association with up to 16,000 members, which split again after some weeks, so the former Deutsche Freischar became an independent association again.Werner Kindt:Die Deutsche Jugendbewegung 1920 bis 1933.

He was a joint minister of a Scots church in Dublin and an Irish commissioner of education. He introduced a different style of education in Ireland whereby children of different denominations could go to the same school. Biography Carlile was born in Paisley. He was educated at Paisley Grammar School and then studied divinity at the universities in Glasgow and Edinburgh. He was licensed to preach in 1811 by the Paisley Presbyterians and in 1815 at the Scots' Church, Mary's Abbey, in Dublin. On 1 July 1813 he published the constitution of a Purgatorian Society, which was an unusual concept. The constitution took a tract from the Bible as their guide. They agreed to pay one penny a week, and in exchange prayers would be offered for their souls at 10 a.m. every month. Delineation of Roman Catholicism Drawn from the Authentic and Acknowledged Standards of the Church of Rome : Namely, Her Creeds, Catechisms, Decisions of Councils, Papal Bulls, Roman Catholic Writers, the Records of History...], By Charles Elliott The tract they chose was It is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead that they may be loosed from their sins.Maccabees xii 46 The idea was that members would spend less time in Purgatory. The rules of the society laid down that all members would be entitled to a mass in their honour assuming that they had a natural death and there were no fees owing to the society. In 1817 he made an important speech which changed Irish church policy.Short History of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Prof. John M. Barkley, Chapter 3. Retrieved 1 August 2008 This speech was in protest of Lord Castlereagh's suggestion that the synod should recognise the Belfast Academical Institution instead of a Scottish university to educate their ministers. Carlile was moderator of the synod of Ulster in 1825. Education policy Carlile was appointed resident commissioner to the new Irish board of national education in 1831. He devised and introduced a radical system of education. It was based on the idea of both Protestant and Catholic children being educated together, except for separate religious education. He sat on the school board with the Anglican Archbishop Richard Whately and the Roman Catholic Archbishop Daniel Murray. The two Dublin archbishops both regarded Carlile highly despite the objections they all received from less radical wings of both denominations. In 1839 he resigned, but by this time he had handled the main arguments, commissioned new textbooks and a new Dublin teacher training college where he had served as a professor. The educational reforms are seen as divisive. The Catholic encyclopaedia describes how the reform was \\"left in the hands of the Protestant Archbishop of Dublin (Dr. Whately) and his Presbyterian ally, Rev. James Carlile, both of whom were unceasing in unscrupulous efforts to make it an engine of attack on the Catholic faith of the Irish people.\\" A geography course written by Carlile describes a tour of the world including England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland which are the \\"British Empire in Europe\\". The Welsh are so industrious that they \\"carry their knitting wherever they go\\", whereas Dublin used to have more factories, but the workers refused to lower their wages to a level that their masters could afford. Home missionary In 1839 he successfully persuaded his church to allow him to become their missionary to a church in Birr. This church, led by their minister, had left the Roman Catholic Church and had applied to join the Presbyterians. Carlile served in this role of missionary, but continued with other interests. Carlile journeyed to London to attend the World Anti-Slavery Convention on 12 June 1840. The picture above shows him in a painting made to commemorate the event which attracted delegates from America, France, Haiti, Australia, Ireland, Jamaica and Barbados.The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840, Benjamin Robert Haydon. Retrieved 19 July 2008 In 1845 Carlile was moderator of the church's general assembly and in the same year he was awarded a Doctorate in Divinity from Glasgow University. Carlile retired to Dublin in 1852 after his wife, Jane, died in Birr. He died at his home in Rathmines, on 31 March 1854. A church service in Dublin was followed by a burial in Birr.

In July 2008 the finance companies within Hanover Group froze repayments, suspending acceptance of new deposits. Hanover paid dividends of NZ$41 million in the 2007 financial year and NZ$45.5 million in the 2008 financial year. The following financial year, NZ$68.5m was contributed to Hanover by entities associated with Watson and Hotchin.

Goddesses known to have been referred to by the title include Inanna, Anat, Isis, Nut, Astarte, and possibly Asherah (by the prophet Jeremiah). In Greco-Roman times, Hera and Juno bore this title. Forms and content of worship varied. Inanna Akkadian cylinder seal depicting the goddess Inanna resting her foot on the back of a lion while Ninshubur stands in front of her paying obeisance, c. 2334-2154 BC Inanna was the Sumerian goddess of love and war. Despite her association with mating and fertility of humans and animals, Inanna was not a mother goddess and is rarely associated with childbirth.Fiore, Silvestro. Voices From the Clay: the development of Assyro- Babylonian Literature. University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 1965. Inanna was also associated with rain and storms and with the planet Venus.Jacobsen, Thorkild. The Treasures of Darkness: a History of Mesopotamian Religion. Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1976. The Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa, believed to have been compiled around the mid-seventeenth century BCE, referred to the planet Venus in the tablet as the \\"bright queen of the sky\\" or \\"bright Queen of Heaven\\". Although the title of Queen of Heaven was often applied to many different goddesses throughout antiquity, Inanna is the one to whom the title is given the most number of times. In fact, Inanna's name is commonly derived from Nin-anna which literally means \\"Queen of Heaven\\" in ancient Sumerian (It comes from the words NIN meaning \\"lady\\" and AN meaning \\"sky\\"),Wolkstein, Diane and Noah Kramer, Samuel, \\"Inanna: Queen of Heaven and Earth\\" - a modern, poetic reinterpretation of Inanna myths although the cuneiform sign for her name (Borger 2003 nr. 153, U+12239 íàπ) is not historically a ligature of the two. In several myths, Inanna is described as being the daughter of Nanna, the ancient Sumerian god of the Moon.Wolkstein, Diane, and Samuel Noah Kramer. Inanna: Queen of Heaven and Earth: Her Stories and Hymns from Sumer. Harper &Row;, Publishers, 1983, New York. In other texts, however, she is often described as being the daughter of either Enki or An.http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr141.htmhttp://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr131.htmhttp://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr132.htm These difficulties have led some early Assyriologists to suggest that Inanna may have been originally a Proto-Euphratean goddess, possibly related to the Hurrian mother goddess Hannahannah, accepted only latterly into the Sumerian pantheon, an idea supported by her youthfulness, and that, unlike the other Sumerian divinities, she at first had no sphere of responsibilities.Harris, Rivkah (1991), \\"Inanna-Ishtar as Paradox and a Coincidence of Opposites\\" (History of Religions, Vol. 30, No. 3 (Feb., 1991)), pp. 261-278 The view that there was a Proto-Euphratean substrate language in Southern Iraq before Sumerian is not widely accepted by modern Assyriologists.Rubio, Gonzalo (1999), \\"On the Alleged \\"Pre-Sumerian Substratum\\" (Journal of Cuneiform Studies, Vol. 51, 1999 (1999)), pp. 1-16 In Sumer Inanna was hailed as \\"Queen of Heaven\\" in the third millennium BC. In Akkad to the north, she was worshipped later as Ishtar. In the Sumerian Descent of Inanna, when Inanna is challenged at the outermost gates of the underworld, she replies:Wolkstein, Diane and Samuel Noah Kramer. Inanna: Queen of Heaven and Earth: Her Stories and Hymns from Sumer. Harper and Row, Publishers, 1983, New York. (Page 55) Her cult was deeply embedded in Mesopotamia and among the Canaanites to the west. F. F. Bruce describes a transformation from a Venus as a male deity to Ishtar, a female goddess by the Akkadians. He links Ishtar, Tammuz, Innini, Ma (Cappadocia), Mami, Dingir-Mah, Cybele, Agdistis, Pessinuntica and the Idaean Mother to the cult of a great mother goddess.Bruce, F. F. (1941), \\"Babylon and Rome\\" (The Evangelical Quarterly, Vol. 13, (Oct. 15, 1941)), pp. 241-261  Astarte  The goddess, the Queen of Heaven, whose worship Jeremiah so vehemently opposed, may have been possibly Astarte. Astarte is the name of a goddess as known from Northwestern Semitic regions, cognate in name, origin and functions with the goddess Ishtar in Mesopotamian texts. Another transliteration is ‚ÄòAshtart; other names for the goddess include Hebrew ◊¢◊©◊™◊®◊™ (transliterated Ashtoreth), Ugaritic ‚Äò·πØtrt (also ‚ÄòA·πØtart or ‚ÄòAthtart), Akkadian DAs-tar-t√∫ (also Astartu) and Etruscan Uni-Astre (Pyrgi Tablets). Astarte riding in a chariot with four branches protruding from roof, on the reverse of a Julia Maesa coin from Sidon According to scholar Mark S. Smith, Astarte may be the Iron Age (after 1200 BC) incarnation of the Bronze Age (to 1200 BC) Asherah. Astarte was connected with fertility, sexuality, and war. Her symbols were the lion, the horse, the sphinx, the dove, and a star within a circle indicating the planet Venus. Pictorial representations often show her naked. Astarte was accepted by the Greeks under the name of Aphrodite. The island of Cyprus, one of Astarte's greatest faith centers, supplied the name Cypris as Aphrodite's most common byname. Asherah was worshipped in ancient Israel as the consort of El and in Judah as the consort of Yahweh and Queen of Heaven (the Hebrews baked small cakes for her festival):William G. Dever, \\"Did God Have a Wife?\\" (Eerdmans, ,2005) - see reviews of this book by Patrick D. Miller, Yairah Amit . Hebrew Bible references The \\"Queen of Heaven\\" is mentioned in the bible and has been associated with a number of different goddess by different scholars, including: Anat, Astarte or Ishtar, Ashtoreth, or as a composite figure. The worship of a \\"Queen of Heaven\\" (, Malkath haShamayim) is recorded in the Book of Jeremiah, in the context of the Prophet condemning such religious worship and it being the cause of God declaring he would be removed his people from the land.Biblegateway, Jeremiah 7, 17. In Jeremiah 44:15-18:Biblegateway, Jeremiah 44. There was a temple of Yahweh in Egypt at that time, the 6th-7th centuries BC, that was central to the Jewish community at Elephantine in which Yahweh was worshipped in conjunction with the goddess Anath (also named in the temple papyri as Anath-Bethel and Anath- Iahu).Dr. Raphael Patai: \\"The Hebrew Goddess\\": Duke University Press: third edition The goddesses Asherah, Anat and Astarte first appear as distinct and separate deities in the tablets discovered in the ruins of the library of Ugarit (modern Ras Shamra, Syria). Some biblical scholars tend to regard these goddesses as one, especially under the title \\"Queen of heaven\\". John Day states that \\"there is nothing in first-millennium BC texts that singles out Asherah as 'Queen of Heaven' or associates her particularly with the heavens at all.\\"Day, John. Yahweh and the gods and goddesses of Canaan. Continuum International Publishing Group - Sheffie (26 Dec 2002). , p. 146. F. F. Bruce, an evangelical (Biblical) scholar differentiates between Astarte and Asherah as two distinct feminine deities.Bruce, F. F. (1941), \\"Babylon and Rome\\" (The Evangelical Quarterly, Vol. 13, (Oct. 15, 1941)), p. 245 Isis A statue of Isis nursing her son, housed in the Louvre Apuleius wrote about the Queen of Heaven, referring to Queen Isis Isis was venerated first in Egypt. As per the Greek historian Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BC, Isis was the only goddess worshiped by all Egyptians alike,Histories 2.42 and whose influence was so widespread by that point, that she had become completely syncretic with the Greek goddess Demeter.Histories 2.156 It is after the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great, and the Hellenization of the Egyptian culture initiated by Ptolemy I Soter, that she eventually became known as 'Queen of Heaven'.R.E Witt, \\"Isis in the Ancient World\\", 1997, Lucius Apuleius confirms this in Book 11, Chap 47 of his novel, The Golden Ass, in which his character prays to the \\"Queen of Heaven\\". The goddess herself responds to his prayer, delivering a lengthy monologue in which she explicitly identifies herself as both the Queen of Heaven and Isis. > Then with a weeping countenance, I made this orison to the puissant Goddess, > saying: O blessed Queen of Heaven... > Thus the divine shape breathing out the pleasant spice of fertile Arabia, > disdained not with her divine voice to utter these words unto me: Behold > Lucius I am come, thy weeping and prayers has moved me to succor thee.

The Lin Ben Yuan Family (; r≈çmaji: Rin Hon Gen), also known as the Banqiao Lin Family (), are a Taiwanese family of businesspeople, politicians, and scholars. They rose from Banqiao, Taipei during the era of the Qing dynasty and are still active in present Taiwan. In June 2008, Forbes ranked Lin Ming-cheng as the 20th-richest person in Taiwan. He is a member of the seventh generation of the family and the vice chairman of Hua Nan Financial Holdings. Origin The family was descended from Lin Ying-yin (ÊûóÊáâÂØÖ) who moved from Longxi (ÈæçÊ∫™), Zhangzhou, Fujian province, mainland China to Xinzhuang of Qing-era Taiwan in 1784. His second son, , accompanied him in search of opportunities in the new frontier. Lin Ying-yin became a teacher while Lin Ping-Hou managed to work for a rice merchant. Recognizing his diligence and penchant for business, he was given the opportunity to start his own rice trading firm which sparked the beginning of his wealth and fortune. With the wealth created from the rice business, he expanded into other commodity trades and invested in real estate. In later years, Lin Ping-hou divided his portfolio of businesses into five separately owned and managed entities for his five sons. The entities were named \\"Yin\\" (È£≤), \\"Shui\\" (Ê∞¥), \\"Ben\\" (Êú¨), \\"Si\\" (ÊÄù) and \\"Yuan\\" (Ê∫ê), which is a meaningful proverb and a strong family value. It literally means to always remember the source of the water which we are drinking; a constant reminder to be grateful and respectful of the origins, ancestry or reasons for the favourable or better current conditions. From the eldest to the youngest, the sons were Lin Guodong (ÊûóÂúãÊ£ü), Lin Guoren (ÊûóÂúã‰ªÅ), Lin Guohua (ÊûóÂúãËèØ), Lin Guoying (ÊûóÂúãËã±), and Lin Guofang (ÊûóÂúãËä≥). Two of the brothers, Lin Guohua and Lin Guofang, who were, respectively, the third and fifth children, united their business entities they had received, Ben and Yuan, and so the family name became \\"Lin Ben Yuan\\". Legacy In 1819, Lin Ping-hou built Lin Shi Yi Zhuang (), a charitable home and organization for the less fortunate people back in his home town in China. This home has been restored and has become a historical landmark. Ji Gu Shu Wu, a library in the Lin Family Mansion and Garden. The Lin Family Mansion and Garden, the house of the family in Taiwan, is a typical Chinese garden which was appointed as a national monument. The Lin Family Mansion in Gulangyu Island, Xiamen, China was built in 1895 by Lim Nee Kar (ÊûóÁàæÂòâ; Lin Erjia), second son of Lin Wei Yuan. The mansion became a boutique hotel in 2010. The buildings are under conservation by government's mandate and have preserved much of its architecture and magnificence. Accompanying the mansion is Shuzhuang Garden (ËèΩËéäËä±Âúí) which is at the southern tip of Gulangyu Island. It was also created by Lim Nee Kar in 1913 as he had wanted to recreate the family's garden in Taiwan which he dearly missed. In 1955, this garden was donated to the Chinese government and opened to the public.

He was given an award in 1836 for advancing \\"negro freedom\\" after accusing the judges in Mauritius of bias. He understood that colour prejudice and slavery were different problems. Biography Jeremie was born to John Jeremie, a barrister, on the British island of Guernsey in 1795. The History of Guernsey With Occasional Notices of Jersey, Alderney, and Sark, and Biographical Sketches, Jonathan Duncan, 1841, p643-4 accessed 1 August 2008 He went to Blundell's School in Devon before studying law in Dijon, France. His father died in Malta in 1810. He was called to the bar in his home island where he was successful, and published a posthumous legal work of his father's. St Lucia Jeremie was appointed in 1824 to be Chief Justice of Saint Lucia, a post he held until 1831. During this time he was called upon to administer the slave laws that applied in the British Empire at that time. Although the slave trade had been abolished in the British Empire, slavery per se continued to be legal in some form during this time. The issue of slavery continued to be a subject that Jeremie was associated with throughout his life. He wrote four essays on Colonial Slavery pointing out the problems of slave communities and the improvements made in their conditions in Saint Lucia. He also advised on how to end slavery altogether. These publications were brought to the British public's attention and are thought to have contributed to slavery's abolition. Mauritius Jeremie was appointed the procureur and advocate general of the island of Mauritius in 1832, but this was a very difficult appointment. In 1830, the Governor Sir Charles Colville reported that there was a great deal of bad feeling against His Majesty's Government continues to prevail and shew itself here‚Ä¶ there is an almost total cessation in the payment of taxes...Mauritius News , August 2008 He arrived there in June 1832, and the hostility to him as a known abolitionist was very difficult to handle. It took an armed escort to get him off his boat after trying to leave for two days. The judges refused to turn up to appoint him, and he was attacked by a mob in the street. Sir Charles Colville ordered him home, but he was sent out again when he arrived back in Great Britain. He arrived again the following year but there were continued charges about his and others' behaviour. In 1833 he charged the judges with bias and involvement with slavery. The governor failed to support him, and he resigned again and left on 28 October 1833. His behaviour was justified in his 1835 report ‚Äì \\"Recent Events at Mauritius\\". Jeremie could see that slavery would be illegal soon, and he predicted that other existing laws predicated on colour prejudice would be a source of further ill feeling. He petitioned to have the respective laws revoked. Ceylon On 2 October 1835 he was appointed second puisne judge of the Ceylon Supreme Court, and took up the position on 9 December 1836. In the same year he was honoured by the Anti-Slavery Society with a plaque that read: Jeremie was in London to attend the World's anti-slavery convention on 12 June 1840. With some premonition, Jeremie was to write later of his time in Ceylon, when others were worried that he had accepted a position as a Governor in Sierra Leone: London The portrait above shows him in a detail from this painting made to commemorate the event which attracted delegates from America, France, Haiti, Australia, Ireland, Jamaica and Barbados. Sierra Leone He was appointed Governor of Sierra Leone on 15 October 1840Rulers.org, accessed 1 August 2008 which was both an honour and a health risk. His confidence is apparent in the quotation above where he notes that he survived six years in Ceylon and outlived the other judges appointed to the Supreme Court there. His only daughter Catherine married Captain Taylor in March 1841.Gentleman's Magazine, 1841, accessed 1 August 2008 He was knighted on 15 November 1840, before leaving for Africa.

It is located south-east of Vilnius along a railway.  History It is believed that there was a castle in Nemƒó≈æis during the reign of Vytautas the Great (1392‚Äì1430). The settlement was first mentioned in written sources in 1496 when Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander Jagiellon welcomed his future wife Helena of Moscow here. On 3 November 1656, the Truce of Vilna between Tsardom of Russia and the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth was signed in the Nemƒó≈æis estate, then owned by Lew Sapieha.  Lipka Tatars  Nemƒó≈æis is one of several Lithuanian settlements where Lipka Tatars live. Brought as prisoners of war, Tatars were allowed to settle here in 1397 after Vytautas' expeditions against the Golden Horde (see the Battle of Blue Waters). Up until this day they have preserved their traditions and Islamic religion. At first Tatars served as personal guards for the Grand Duke of Lithuania, but later took up more civil professions: breeding horses, tanning, gardening. Eventually Tatars became known as excellent gardeners, growing eggplants, tomatoes, and other vegetables. Even today Nemƒó≈æis is known for its numerous greenhouses. The first wooden mosque in Nemƒó≈æis was built in 1684. It burned down but a new one was built in 1909. During the Soviet times it was turned into a warehouse. After Lithuania declared independence, the mosque was returned to the community and it continues to be used for religious services. In 1993 it was restored. It is used for prayer only on Fridays, young moon. On that occasion a mullah comes from Vilnius. Nemƒó≈æis mosque is one of four operational mosques in Lithuania. Nemƒó≈æis also has an operational Tatar cemetery and a Tatar school. Nemƒó≈æis estate  Nemƒó≈æis estate in 2007 The Nemƒó≈æis estate, located approximately 1 km outside the village, was established in the 16th century. At first it belonged to the Pac family, but changed hands frequently. Its owners at different times were the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family, Jan Kazimierz Sapieha, Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, Lew Sapieha, and the Ogi≈Ñski family.

In October 1736 she returned to England and was paid off. She was recommissioned in June 1739 under the command of Captain John Toller, and served with Admiral Nicholas Haddock's fleet in the Mediterranean. Command had passed to Captain Temple West by 1743, under whom she was present at the Battle of Toulon on 11 February 1744. She was recommissioned in January 1746 under the command of Captain Robert Erskine. On 14 July 1747, Warwick was off the Azores in company with the 40-gun Lark, Captain John Crookshanks, when she encountered the Spanish 74 Glorioso, sailing from the Spanish Main with 3 million dollars in treasure.

It is found in Europe, parts of Asia and North Africa. The adult is a small mottled brown and white insect with a wingspan of . The moth flies in a single generation from June to October and is a pest of maritime pine and several other species of pine, on which the caterpillars feed. Description Moths in the genus Dioryctria generally have forewings that are dark greyish-brown to black, with various white markings, chevrons and zigzag lines. Dioryctria sylvestrella has a wingspan of and is very similar in appearance to related species. This moth was first detected in Britain in 2001, and can be told from the three other species in the genus already there by the fact that the \\"subterminal line is generally smooth with a single waved kink [at] its mid-point, in the other three species this line is dentate from the mid-point to the dorsum\\". Distribution and hosts Dioryctria sylvestrella occurs naturally in Europe, much of Asia and North Africa. It occurs as far north as the Arctic Circle but is more common at lower latitudes, and this is where it does most damage. In Europe, it mainly infests the maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) but it can feed on other species of pine, and on spruce. Other known hosts are P. caribaea, P. halepensis, P. kesiya, P. merkusii, P. nigra and P. pinea. New shoots on trees that have been treated with fertiliser are more likely to be infested than unfertilised trees, and pruned trees are also targeted over non-pruned trees. Life cycle The adult moths are on the wing in southern Europe from about July to September. The female chooses fast-growing, vigorous host trees on which to lay its eggs. The larvae attack buds, shoots, cones, and young stems. Damaged tissue or sites attacked by the rust fungus Endocronartium allow the larvae to enter the tissues and tunnel under the bark into the phloem. The larvae usually stay near where they hatched, but occasionally migrate to other parts of the tree. They pupate inside the mass of resin mixed with frass which they produce. Damage The larvae of this moth are one of the main pests of maritime pine, an important plantation crop of the Mediterranean region where it is grown for timber and resin production as well as dune stabilisation. Their boring activity causes large quantities of resin to flow from the wounds which weakens the tree and allows fungi and other pathogens to gain entry.

At a young age she combined her artistic and literary talent with technical research. The first printed work appeared in 1911 and described in verses the lives of women over the centuries. In the same year she first married, but after only six years this marriage ended in divorce. In 1916 she met Raoul H.

History and profile Lamalif was launched in 1966 by Zakya Daoud and her husband Mohamed Loghlam. It took its title from two Arabic letters that form the word \\"la\\" (), meaning \\"no\\". This sly wordplay encapsulated the magazine's objective. Launched after the defeat of the Moroccan opposition (Union Socialiste des Forces Populaires) by the monarchy, Lamalif was a form of challenge. \\"The goal in this tragic situation was not to lose hope, to build an alternative,\\" explained the founders. Zakya Daoud also served as the editor-in-chief of the monthly during its publication until 1988. Throughout its 22 years existence, Lamalif was characterised by its intellectual rigour and radical leftist political stance. Covering social, cultural and economical issues, all from a political and critical perspective it established itself as \\"a space for reflection and a force of significant challenge.\\" Its ideological debates amongst journalists, economists, academics, and politicians became intellectual references and proved seminal in the development of many of Morocco's best thinkers and writers. Its focus on arts and culture was equally influential. Is covers frequently featured work by artists and its writings on film contributed to the rise of Moroccan cinema in the 1970s.

G. mellonella is found throughout the world. It is one of two species of wax moths, with the other being the lesser wax moth. G. mellonella eggs are laid in the spring, and they have four life stages. Males are able to generate ultrasonic sound pulses, which, along with pheromones, are used in mating. The larvae of G. mellonella are also often used as a model organism in research. The greater wax moth is well known for its parasitization of honeybees and their hives. Because of the economic loss caused by this species, several control methods including heat treatment and chemical fumigants such as carbon dioxide have been used.  Geographic range  G. mellonella was first reported as a pest in Asia, but then spread to northern Africa, Great Britain, some parts of Europe, northern America, and New Zealand. The species is now distributed throughout the globe. It has been reported in twenty-seven African countries, nine Asian countries, five North American countries, three Latin American countries, Australia, ten European countries, and five island countries. It is projected that the pest may spread further, especially due to climate change.  Habitat  G. mellonella can be found where honeybees are cultivated.  Food resources = Larvae  G. mellonella larvae parasitize the honeybee. Eggs are laid in the cracks and crevices inside the hive, which minimizes egg detection. Once eggs hatch, they feed on the midrib of the wax comb, the cast skins of bee larvae, pollen, and small quantities of propolis and honey. Live larvae are never eaten. Recent research suggests that the greater wax moth larvae can eat and digest a specific type of plastic, polyethylene. Polyethylene is one of the most difficult plastics to break down. Investigation is underway to determine how the caterpillar accomplishes this for a possible technological solution to recycling the world's excess plastic waste.  Parental care = Oviposition  Shortly after emergence, G. mellonella females lay their eggs in the small cracks and crevices inside a beehive. Females prefer to lay their eggs in strong, healthy bee colonies over weaker colonies, but weaker colonies have a higher rate of G. mellonella infestation. Eggs are laid in clusters of varying number depending on the region. Clusters of 50-150 eggs have been reported in the United States, whereas clusters of 300-600 eggs have commonly been reported in India. Up to 1800 eggs have been deposited by a single female.  Life history  The life cycle of G. mellonella proceeds through four stages: egg, larvae, pupae and adult. Generally, eggs are laid in the early spring and the moth undergoes four to six generations annually. By December, the eggs, larvae, and pupae enter diapause in wait for warmer weather. Factors that can affect length of life stages The effects of temperature and humidity on life stages have been most thoroughly studied. Temperatures around and humidity levels around 29-33% are optimal for development, though studies in Kansas have shown normal larval development at temperatures as high as . Average temperatures higher than have been shown to be lethal for larva. Lower temperatures at , however, resulted in only part of the life cycle being completed. At temperatures below , even short exposures kill larva and adults. Intraspecific factors also affect life stages: cannibalism of instars in the process of moulting has been seen, though only in situations where food is scarce. Diet quality also can affect larva development; nutrient deprived larvae are more susceptible to infection by the yeast Candida albicans.  Egg  Mounted, dorsal view Eggs are smooth and spherical in appearance, with a size ranging from 0.4 to 0.5 mm. Coloring ranges from pink to cream to white. They are laid in clusters in small cracks and crevices in the hive, and can take anytime from 7.2 to 21.8 days to hatch.  Larvae  Larva range in size from 3 to 30 mm long, and are white or dirty gray color. They feed on honey, pollen, cast off skin of honeybee larvae, and the midrib of the wax comb; cannibalism has also been observed in food shortages. Less often, they are found in bumblebee and wasp nests, or feeding on dried figs.Grabe (1942) Feeding is more intense during earlier instars compared to later instars. They can remain in the larval stage anywhere between 28 days to 6 months, during which they undergo eight to ten molting stages. While silk is spun during all stages, at the last instar the larvae spins a cocoon of silk for itself and enters the pupal stage. Mounted, ventral view  Pupae  Pupae are immobile, do not feed, and remain housed in their cocoon for 1 to 9 weeks until emerging as adults. Size ranges from 14 to 16 mm. Pupae start off as a brownish white, but gradually darken to a dark brown color just before adults are ready to emerge.  Adult  Adult moths are brown gray and range from 10 to 18 mm in length. The adults' wingspan is 30 to 41 mm. This moth flies from May to October in the temperate parts of its range, such as Belgium and the Netherlands. Females are larger and heavier than males, and possess a characteristic beaklike head. The outer margin of the forewing is smooth and the labial palp is extended forwards. Males are identified by the semilunar notch. Females live for an average of 12 days; males live for an average of 21 days. Silk trails left by larvae in a bumblebee nest in a bird box.  Host  G. mellonella larvae parasitize wild honeybees. Eggs are laid within the hive, and the larva that hatch tunnel through the honeycombs that contain honeybee larva and their honey stores. The tunnels they create are lined with silk, which entangles and starves emerging bees, a phenomenon known as galleriasis. Tunnels also result in massive destruction of the combs. As a result, honey is wasted as it leaks out when cell caps are eaten. Finally, both G. mellonella adults and larvae can be vectors for pathogens that can infect honeybees, including the Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) and the black queen cell virus (BQCV).  Enemies = Parasites  Apanteles galleriae parasitizes G. mellonella larva inside the beehive. 1-2 eggs are laid by the adult Apanteles galleriae on each larva, though only one succeeds in parasitizing the host and surviving. The parasite emerges and ruptures the host body, and pupates into a small cocoon. Parasitism increases gradually, starting in February, reaching its peak in May, then declining until July. However, it is unlikely that this parasite will take root in a strong, healthy colony as they will be kept out of the hive by bees. Even if they are able to enter the hive, it is difficult to navigate through the darkness in order to find their host. Habrobracon hebetor also parasitizes G. mellonella adults, along with other members of the family Pyralidae. It uses male-secreted sex pheromones to locate its host.  Mating  Males call for females with ultrasonic sound pulses that attract virgin females and initiate courtship Once females get closer, males produce a sex pheromone to initiate mating. There are many known kinds of sex pheromone including nonanal, decanal, hexanal, heptanal, undecanal, 6,10,14 trimethylpentacanol-2 and 5,11-dimethylpentacosane. It is also known that these pheromones are often used to create traps to attract females. However, as traps baited with these pheromones do not attract virgin females over long distances, acoustics have to be used to draw females in first.  Physiology = Sound generation  Males generate ultrasonic sound pulses at 75 kHz, 200Œºs per pulse that are used to attract females for mating. This is generated by twisting an end of the tymbal, the membrane that produces sound in insects, with the wings. This causes the tymbal to buckle and results in the emission of an ultrasonic pulse. However, isolated males will not generate sound, thus stimulation from other wax moths is required. Females respond to these pulses by fanning their wings, resulting in 40 and 80 Hz wingbeat frequencies that are detected by the males; which then produces sex pheromones so the female can find him.  Hearing organs  Both sexes are equipped with a sensitive tympanic hearing organ that allows the great wax worm to perceive high frequency sound. This likely resulted from selective pressure from insectivorous bats; being able to detect their echolocation would enable G. mellonella to avoid being eaten. Female tympanic membranes are 0.65 mm across; males‚Äô are 0.55 mm across. They are located on the ventral side of the first abdominal segment. Emitters that produced ultrasonic sounds at similar frequencies as echolocation prompted G. mellonella to tilt their head and then exhibit dropping, looping, and freezing behaviors, all of which are meant to evade predators. The head tilt was a direct response to sound reception; once tympanic hearing organs were destroyed, this response was lost. Notably, predator evading behaviors were not exhibited when G. mellonella was exposed to lower frequency ultrasounds of moderate intensity. G. mellonella seems to be able to differentiate between different frequencies and pulsing patterns. It has been hypothesized that G. mellonella use the 30‚Äì100 Hz range for communication with other members of its species. This is an ideal frequency as honeybees, its host, generally do not produce sound in this range.  Interactions with humans = Beekeeping  This species of moth is a major parasite of the wild and cultivated honey bee, costing millions of dollars of damage each year. It is said to be present in any area where beekeeping is practiced. After eggs are laid in the hive, the larvae burrow through the honeycombs and cause massive destruction, in addition to trapping emergent bees. Measures have been developed to prevent and manage infestations, but many have unresolved downsides. = Management = G. mellonella causes massive economic losses in the honeybee cultivation industry; the Southern U.S. loses 4-5% of its profits per year due to this one pest. In order to prevent or manage infestations, cultivators are encouraged to maintain sanitary conditions for their bees, as it will keep the colony strong so they can keep G. mellonella out. Cracks and crevices should also be sealed so that adult G. mellonella cannot lay their eggs there. Combs should be replaced regularly and infested combs should be removed as soon as possible. Temperature treatments also destroy G. mellonella at all stages of its life cycle. Heat treatment keeps the combs and beekeeping equipment at 45-80 ¬∞C for 1‚Äì4 hours, or in hot water for 3‚Äì5 hours. However, heating at this temperature can cause sagging and distortion of the wax. Cold treatment cools the combs to -15 to -7 ¬∞C for 2-4.5 hours. Chemical fumigants also destroy all stages of G. mellonella and are economically convenient. At present, only CO2 is approved to treat infested colonies, because other chemicals leave residues that make their way into the honey produced and pose risks for the person treating the hive. Usage of gamma radiation to sterilize male pupae, or the male sterilization technique (MST), has also been used to control Galleria mellonella populations. 350 Gy of ionizing radiation was found to be most effective, and a ratio of 4 sterilized males to 1 normal male to 1 female resulted in the greatest decrease of hatched eggs and larvae that became pupae. In research The waxworms of the greater wax moth have been shown to be an excellent model organism for in vivo toxicology and pathogenicity testing, replacing the use of small mammals in such experiments. The larvae are also well-suited models for studying the innate immune system. In genetics, they can be used to study inherited sterility. NOTE: cellular and humoral immunity are part of acquired immunity, which is only in vertebrates. Insects only have innate immunity. Experiments with infected waxworms support the hypothesis that the bacterial stilbenoid 3,5-Dihydroxy-4-isopropyl-trans- stilbene has antibiotic properties that help minimize competition from other microorganisms and prevents the putrefaction of the insect cadaver infected by the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis, itself host for the Photorhabdus bacterium. G. mellonella is reported to be capable of hearing ultrasonic frequencies approaching 300 kHz, possibly the highest frequency sensitivity of any animal. The caterpillar of G. mellonella has attracted interest for its ability to eat and digest polyethylene plastic. In laboratory experiments with G. mellonella caterpillars, about 100 caterpillars consumed 92 milligrams of a polyethylene-plastic shopping bag over the course of 12 hours. While it is clear that the caterpillars are consuming the plastic, more research needs to be done to determine if this chemistry is the result of G. mellonella or its gut flora. The moth's larvae break down polyethylene to ethylene glycol and a mass loss of 13% polyethylene over 14 hours has been documented in polyethylene films. Another closely related species of waxworm, Plodia interpunctella, has been the subject of research which isolated two strains of bacteria from its gut, Enterobacter asburiae and Bacillus species which have been demonstrated as capable of growing on and decomposing polyethylene plastic in a laboratory setting.

Located in the Shomron region to the south of Route 65, about 6 km northeast of Hadera, it falls under the jurisdiction of Menashe Regional Council. In , it had a population of . History In 1913 a small group of young Jews belonging to the HaShomer (Watchmen's) organization chose to establish a guard post near the entrance to Wadi 'Ara, which would also serve as a way station for travelers between the Mediterranean coast and the Galilee. From then on, the place was inhabited on- and-off by a few groups of pioneers, each of which was driven away by the harsh conditions ‚Äì malaria, lack of water (until 1935, water had to be brought in by horse and cart from nearby Karkur), remoteness from any other settlement, and World War I which was raging and making life difficult. In 1921, after British takeover of the land from the Ottoman Turks, members of Gdud HaAvoda, the Work Battalion, arrived in order to build a one-acre, fortified courtyard. They constructed a two-meter high stone wall with slits for shooting at attackers and a large, iron gate. A solitary, two-story stone building was also constructed which was intended to house the local people in times of trouble. The house was built in the style of 19th century houses in southern France and stands on the site to this day. Despite the large investment and effort expended on building the wall and the house, the members of Gdud HaAvodah left only a small contingent to stay on after completion of the construction. Of these, eventually only one person remained, who would later become the first member of Kibbutz Ein Shemer. His name was Shmuel Shuali and he was affectionately called Shmuel the First by his fellow kibbutz members and by what would be future generations of kibbutzniks. In 1927, the first pioneers of HaShomer HaTzair arrived at the site. The group consisted of 18 women and 36 men, all in their late teens and early twenties. These youngsters left behind parents, homes, and future careers in order to fulfill their dream of revitalizing the Jewish people in its ancient homeland, to work the land with their own hands and to make the Zionist vision come true. They had immigrated from Poland and had at first lived and worked at Ein Ganim near Petah Tikva, awaiting the opportunity to settle and make their contribution in Eretz Israel. Shavuot 1927 is considered the date of the founding of the kibbutz. In the coming years, more groups of HaShomer HaTzair pioneers from Poland joined the first group. Each group had its own name ‚Äì Binyamina, Shomriya, BaDerech ‚Äì which it kept even as its members were integrated into the kibbutz. The hardships that these early settlers endured, like other pioneers who founded other kibbutzim, were great. Eighty years later, it is hard to grasp the enormity of the self-sacrifice that they made in leaving their childhood homes, families, relatives, language and native land. Many of them came from affluent families and most never saw their families again. The lives of the kibbutz members were almost unbearable and 80 of the 100 first members fell ill with malaria. In 1934 the kibbutz was finally hooked up to the electric grid, and only in 1935 water was found on the site, leading to a revolution in the development of the farmstead and to the erection of a local water tower. As members of HaShomer HaTzair, the founders sought ways to bring about cooperation and friendly relations with their Arab neighbors, and social contact was slowly made with the farmers of the area. Yet during the 1930s and 1940s there were security concerns and tension. In 1938 two members of the kibbutz were murdered in an attack by an Arab gang. Following World War II kibbutz members took part in the so-called \\"illegal\\" immigration of Holocaust survivors to the Land of Israel, which was prohibited under the British Mandate. When British soldiers raided neighboring Kibbutz Giv'at Haim in 1945, Ein Shemer members rushed to the defense of that kibbutz and of the right of Jews to immigrate to the Land of Israel. In the ensuing combat one member, Elimelech Shtarkman, was killed and several others were wounded. From the 1940s onward, scores of new members joined the kibbutz, some of them HaShomer HaTzair members from Egypt and the Balkans, which doubled the population of Ein Shemer. Others came through the Youth Aliya organization from Europe after the Holocaust and native Israelis also joined through several groups and individually. This diverse flow of new members greatly enriched the social character of the kibbutz. Ein Shemer gradually stopped absorbing groups; its population since then has increased mainly by absorbing the partners of the second and third generation of members who chose to make the kibbutz their home. Ein Shemer 1943 Ein Shemer 1943 Members of Yiftach Brigade 1st Battalion, \\"D\\" company, training at Ein Shemer in 1947 Kibbutz Ein Shemer is one of the founders of HaKibbutz HaArtzi, the settlement movement of HaShomer HaTzair, and was one of the first four such kibbutzim (today there are 85 in the movement out of a total of about 265 kibbutzim). Among Ein Shemer's members have been prominent personalities in state and movement institutions, including: Zvi Lurie, one of the signers of the Israeli Declaration of Independence; Israel (Kurt) Hertz, one of the leaders of the Histadrut; Ya'kov (Kuba) Riftin, a six-time Knesset member from the Mapam party; and David (Dado) Elazar, a member of the Yugoslavian youth group on Ein Shemer who went on to become commander-in-chief of the Israel Defense Forces. File:Ein Shemer 1942.jpgEin Shemer 1942 1:20,000 File:Qaffin 1945.jpgEin Shemer 1945 1:250,000 Etymology Ein ‚Äì Because the founders of the kibbutz originally belonged to a gar'in group named Ein Ganim Because of their aspiration to find a spring of water [ma'ayan ‚Äì ayin ‚Äì ein] on the land ‚Äì which eventually came to pass. Shemer ‚Äì Because members of HaShomer group set up a guard post on the spot Because the kibbutz founders belonged to HaShomer HaTzair youth group Because the kibbutz is situated within the area of the Biblical kingdom of Shemer, king of the Shomron. Economy  The kibbutz economy in the early years was based primarily on agriculture: flocks of sheep, herds of cows, orchards, orange groves and field crops. Ein Shemer member Abba Stein developed the Anna and the Ein Shemer, two species of apples now grown in various places in the world, as well as other species of apples and plums. Another member, Moshe Grossman, was one of the founders of Granot, an agricultural co-operative that has since become a major economical force in the Israeli agricultural market. Beginning in the 1970s the agricultural branches of the kibbutz were reduced in size and now include cotton and other field crops, avocado groves and cowsheds. Industrial and commercial branches were established and gained prominence in the kibbutz economy. A rubber factory, Ein Shemer Rubber Industries and a plastics factory, Miniplast Ein Shemer, were set up on the kibbutz in 1968 and 1976 respectively, and a small shopping center for the general public was established at the Karkur intersection nearby. Other sources of kibbutz income are from members who work outside the kibbutz, as well as personal initiatives such as the artistic blacksmith's forge, ecological greenhouse, film production company, event planning company, architect's office, center for holistic treatments and others. In the mid 1980s Ein Shemer, together with much of the kibbutz movement, underwent a severe economic downturn as a result of the monetary policy of the new right-wing Israeli government. At the end of the 1990s the kibbutz emerged from the crisis after signing an agreement among the kibbutz, the banks and the Israel Land Administration. At about the same time as the economic crisis, the kibbutz underwent a social transformation, as the center of social life went from the collective to the family unit. In the 1980s the children, who had slept in children's houses since the kibbutz was founded, began sleeping in their parents' homes. During the 1990s many items of consumption were privatized and the members' personal budgets were enlarged as the communal budget decreased in scope. Since about 2000, an ongoing discussion has been raging concerning possible future distribution of differential salaries to the members ‚Äì an issue that has not yet been decided upon . Education and culture Since its founding, the kibbutz has always made education one of its main priorities. The kibbutz children were given special, preferential conditions. They lived in a children's house with their peers, under the guidance of dedicated educators who nurtured in them a love of nature, humanity, a sense of justice and cooperation. Over the years the characteristics of kibbutz education changed, yet to this day kibbutz education is considered among the finest in the country. Ein Shemer's kindergartens have a special kibbutz character, based on treating each child individually and holistically, and at the same time creating a deep connection between the children, their natural surrounding and the community. Another unique educational enterprise is the regional high school, Mevo'ot 'Iron, which was founded in 1949 by members of Kibbutz Ein Shemer and which other kibbutzim, Ma'anit, Barkai, and Metzer later joined. Today the school is a drawing point for young people throughout the area, and has about 1,000 pupils, including young immigrants from Ethiopia and the former Soviet Union. For many years Ein Shemer had one of the leading volleyball teams in Israel, and during the 1950s and 1960s the men's and women's teams were at the top of the national league. One of the high points for local sports fans was the game held in 1960 between HaPoel Ein Shemer and Galatasarai, a Turkish team, for which a playing court and bleachers were built on the kibbutz and still stand. Today Ein Shemer is a partner in a regional volleyball team, HaMa'apil-Ein- Shemer-Menashe. All through the years, the kibbutz has been known for its innumerable artists and intellectuals, far out of proportion to those of the general Israeli public or of other kibbutzim. In the first generation some of the prominent figures were: writers Moshe Zertal, Zvi Lurie, Rivka Gurfine and Zvi Arad; poets Azriel Uchmani and Arieh Shamri, caricaturist and artist Yitzhak (Ignatz) Palgi, architect Ya'akov (Kuba) Gever and many others. Among the second generation, of the sons and daughters of the kibbutz, are poet and author Eli Alon, artists Avital Geva and Tzilla Lis, archaeologist and author Adam Zertal, thinker and writer Avishai Grossman, educator and writer Rafael (Rafi) Shapira, musician Miri Grossberg, Uri Hofi an internationally known teacher and Artist Blacksmith and many others. Notable talents of the third generation include: author Rakefet Zohar, cinematographer Oren Tirosh, musician Zamir Golan and artist Atar Geva. Landmarks The Old Courtyard is a reconstruction museum depicting early kibbutz settlement in Israel.The Old Courtyard Founded over 20 years ago, it stands upon the original one-acre site where the first pioneers established the kibbutz and features indoor and outdoor exhibits of the early years of kibbutz life, as well as pioneering activities such as bread baking for children and youths. Its other attractions include an operable oil press, the oak train (a reconstruction of the Ottoman Turkish train that ran through the region at the beginning of the last century), an exhibit of tractors and agricultural machinery from the early 20th century and others. The Ecological Greenhouse is an educational center dealing with ecology and social commitment. Jewish and Arab youths participate in seminars and workshops devoted to peaceful co-existence, ecology, environment and scientific research. Hofi's Forge consists of a smithy, an exhibition hall and a school for blacksmiths founded over 20 years ago by Uri Hofi, a world acclaimed blacksmith-artisan. On the grounds of the kibbutz is a relief sculpture of the renowned sculptor Nathan Rapoport (not a kibbutz member), commemorating both the operations that brought so-called \\"illegal\\" Jewish immigrants to the Land of Israel and the participation of Ein Shemer members in those operations. Another notable monument is one by sculptor Rudlinger (member of Kibbutz HaZore'a), commemorating two paratroopers, members of Kibbutz Ein Shemer, who were killed in the Six-Day War in 1967.

The fund was invested in third sector organisations delivering public services to improve their financial and strategic capability.  Background  Government responsibility for Futurebuilders lies within the Office for Civil Society within the Cabinet Office. The fund was managed by Social Investment Business.  Purpose  The fund aimed to strengthen the third sector's role in public service delivery through investing in schemes that demonstrated the added value that the sector could contribute to improving public services. Emphasis was put on loan finance, evaluation and knowledge management and sharing. The Government's aims for Futurebuilders programme were to: * Overcome obstacles to efficient service delivery * Modernise the third sector for the long term * Increase both the scope and scale of voluntary and community sector service delivery  History  Futurebuilders was one of the recommendations in the Treasury‚Äôs Cross Cutting Review into the role of the voluntary and community sector in public service delivery, September 2002. In the autumn of 2003 the Government ran a tendering process, managed by the Treasury, to find an organisation to run the Futurebuilders Fund. This was won in December 2003 by a consortium made up of Charity Bank, Unity Trust Bank, National Council for Voluntary Organisations and Northern Rock Foundation. The consortium then set up a non-profit company, Futurebuilders England Ltd, to manage the fund. In 2007, the Cabinet Office opened the tender to manage the contract of the second phase of the Futurebuilders fund (2008‚Äì11). This tender was won by the Adventure Capital Fund (ACF), now the Social the Investment Business (SIB). Since 1 April 2008 the Futurebuilders England fund has been under the management of SIB. Investments Futurebuilders offered investment packages to third sector organisations that wanted to improve public services in England. Part of the investment was always a loan, but parts may also be a grant and professional support. Evaluation  The Futurebuilders fund is now closed to new investments but SIB still manage the ongoing loan portfolio. In 2015, Boston Consulting Group were commissioned to evaluate the success of the fund and released a report 'A Tale of Two Funds' to tell the story of the programme.

Built in Portland, Oregon Cinchona (YN-7) was launched 2 July 1941 by Commercial Iron Works, Portland, Oregon; sponsored by Mrs. W. Casey; outfitted by Puget Sound Navy Yard; and placed in service 15 August 1941, Lieutenant H. H. Breed, USNR, in charge. World War II service  Assigned to the 14th Naval District, she arrived at Pearl Harbor 17 October where she took up duty in net repair and replacement, salvage of gear lost or adrift, and maintenance of net and boom defenses. Under attack at Pearl Harbor During the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, 7 December 1941, Cinchona manned both her machine guns and her 3\\" gun, and, as the enemy repeatedly strafed her deck, she closed the gaps in the net defenses protecting the dry-docks. Continuing her salvage operations in the Hawaiian group, Cinchona salvaged district patrol craft YP-108 off Lanai in June 1942, and in August escorted a motor torpedo boat convoy to Midway Islands, where she installed nets around the dock spaces, returning to Pearl Harbor early in September. She was placed in commission 20 December 1942, her officer-in- charge Lieutenant T. A. Ingham receiving the title commanding officer. She continued local operations at Pearl Harbor, and on 20 January 1944 was redesignated AN-12. Saipan operations Cinchona arrived off newly invaded Saipan 16 June 1944. She conducted patrols, assisted LST-84 after an enemy bomb started a fire on board, then inspected the Japanese net line in Tanapag Harbor. She remained at Saipan on salvage and net operations until 18 November when she steamed to Guam and Ulithi to lay cables. From 7 December 1944 to 30 June 1945 Cinchona conducted net operations, laid moorings, and aided in installing a pipeline at Guam. Post-war activity Returning to the States 27 July, she conducted net operations at Long Beach, California, and out of Mare Island Naval Shipyard until 24 August 1946 when she sailed for Astoria, Oregon. Post-war decommissioning  Cinchona was placed out of commission in reserve 6 November 1946 at Vancouver, Washington. Honors and awards  Cinchona received two battle stars for World War II service. The first was for her performance at Pearl Harbor while under attack by Japanese planes. The second was for her operating under dangerous conditions during the Mariana Islands operation.

He is known for his edition of St. Jerome. Life Martianay was born at Saint-Sever-Cap in the Diocese of Aire. He entered the Benedictines at an early age, and devoted himself to Biblical studies, Greek and Hebrew. A circular letter of Martianay's is still extant, in which he begs the co-operation of Benedictine abbeys in the work of producing a critical and complete edition of Jerome's writings. He spent over thirty years in searching the libraries of France for information. Works Ziegelbauer says (op. cit. below, II, 58) that Martianay completed alone the edition of Jerome's works. The \\"Divina Bibliotheca\\" - the Hieronymian edition of the Vulgate - was in fact executed with the collaboration of Dom Antoine Pouget. Martianay's fame as editor of Jerome has somewhat eclipsed his wider repute as a Biblical scholar. He undertook the work on Jerome to meets the need of such an edition, for all who devoted themselves to Biblical research. He taught Scripture at Arles, Bordeaux, and Carcassonne. In addition, he published many critical works on Biblical questions; he wrote a treatise on inspiration against Richard Simon; also a vindication of the Hebrew text and of the chronology given in the Latin Vulgate. He died, aged 69, at Saint Germain-des-Pr√©s, Paris. Martianay also treated of: the history of the Biblical canon; the French versions of the New Testament in the \\"Tentamen Versionis\\": and wrote a treatise on \\"The Method of explaining Holy Scripture\\". In 1711 he published the life of a nun in the monastery of Beaume. Martianay contributed to Biblical criticism by his edition of the \\"Divina Bibliotheca\\", or Jerome's text of the Vulgate. It attempted to reproduce the text, with scanty materials; he tells us at the close of his prolegomena what manuscripts he had at his disposal, six in all, the most important of which was the MS. Sangermanensis. Martianay published (1695) a separate collation of this text in his edition of the old Latin version of St. Matthew's Gospel and of the Epistle of St. James. This collation, reproduced by Bianchini in his \\"Evangelium Quadruplex\\", was considered faulty; a correction of it is in the first volume of Wordsworth and White, \\"Old Latin Biblical Texts\\". Ziegelbauer mentions also another work of Martianay, never printed, namely, an edition of the Vulgate with variant readings suggested by the Hebrew and Greek texts, and furnished with a series of references to the parallel passages. He also published the three psalters of St. Jerome; these appeared in French. Lastly should be mentioned his \\"New Testament in French\\" (2 vols., Paris, 1712).

Russia has an embassy in Khartoum and Sudan has an embassy in Moscow. History For decades, Russia and Sudan have maintained a strong economic and politically strategic partnership. Due to solidarity with both the United States and with the Soviet Union and with the allies of the two nations, Sudan declared neutrality and instead chose membership in the Non-Aligned Movement throughout the Cold War. In 1967, in response to US support for Israel, Sudan severed relations with U.S.A. By 1970, 2000 advisors from Soviet Union and its satellites were present in Sudan. After the 1969 Sudanese coup d'√©tat, the new government increased economic relations with the Soviet bloc, and in 1971, Soviet Union became the leading importer of Sudanese goods. Soviet-Sudanese relations were minorly damaged when, in 1971 members of the Sudanese Communist Party attempted to assassinate then-president Gaafar Nimeiry, and Nimeiry pegged the blame on the USSR, thus enhancing Sudanese relations with the West. In 1977, in response to large scale Soviet aid to Ethiopia, Sudan expelled Soviet advisors and closed the military section in the Soviet embassy. The relations were damaged again when Sudan supported the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan when the USSR invaded in 1979. Sudan began to buy weapons from Egypt and China, instead of USSR. In 1985, Nimeiry was overthrown in a military coup, and the new government improved relations with USSR. Diplomatic cooperation between the two countries dramatically got back on track during the late 1990s and early 2000s, when Vladimir Putin was elected the President, and then the Prime Minister of Russia, and along with Chinese leader Hu Jintao opposed UN Peacekeepers in Darfur. Russia strongly supports Sudan's territorial integrity and opposes the creation of an independent Darfurian state. Also, Russia is Sudan's strongest investment partner (in Europe) and political ally in Europe, and Russia has repeatedly and significantly regarded Sudan as an important global ally in the African continent. For decades there have been Sudanese college students studying in Russian universities. During the 2008 attack on Omdurman and Khartoum, Justice and Equality Movement rebels from Darfur killed a Russian mercenary pilot by shooting his plane down when he tried to strafe them. SIPRI reports that only 8 percent of Sudanese arms are Chinese, and that Russian arms actually make up the majority, at 87 percent. Russia is the major weapons supplier to the Sudan. Vladimir Putin and Omar al-Bashir, 2017 Amnesty International slammed Russia for breaking the UN arms embargo on Darfur, Russians sold weapons like Mi-24 helicopters, Antonov 26 planes, Russian weapons sales to Sudan totaled 21 million dollars. It was reported these weapons were used to slaughter Darfur civilians. The report said Russia \\"cannot have been unaware of reports of serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law by the Sudanese security forces, But they have nevertheless continued to allow military equipment to be sent to Sudan.\\" Russia was reported to \\"have been or should have been aware, several types of military equipment, including aircraft, have been deployed by the Sudanese armed forces for direct attacks on civilians and indiscriminate attacks in Darfur\\". The Janjaweed also used Russian small arms to murder and loot, these Russian weapons spread into neighboring Chad. In 2005 helicopters from Russia were sold to Sudan for 7 million pounds sterling. Photos show Russian helicopters in Darfur. On August 25, 2017, the Russian ambassador to Sudan, Mirgayas Shirinsky, was found dead in his house in Khartoum. In November 2017, President Omar al-Bashir credited Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War for saving Syria. In 2019, Sudan and Russia signed an agreement, which reportedly, gives Russian Navy access to Sudanese ports. Sudan is among the few countries that officially recognized the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and voted against United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262 (which condemned Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory), which demonstrated the close relations between Russia and Sudan.

It is an early-18th-century landscaped garden covering over in the Vale of Neath, in Neath Port Talbot county borough in south Wales. History The estate was the property of the Mackworth family during the 18th and 19th centuries. There are few traces remaining of the house, once considered \\"one of the finest residences in the principality\\". Historically, the estate was part of the Norman-owned territory of Neath and Afan, which also comprised Neath Abbey and Neath Castle. The first recorded individual owner was Evan ap David during the 16th century. The last of Evan's descendants to own it was Sir Herbert Evans, who died in the late 17th century. Sir Herbert's daughter and sole surviving heir, Mary, married Humphrey Mackworth (later Sir Humphrey) in 1686 and on her death ten years later, Mackworth became owner of the estate. Mackworth extended the house (sometimes known as \\"Gnoll Castle\\"), and developed various coal mining interests locally, as well as branching out into other industries. His eldest son, Herbert Mackworth, continued his industrial interests, and developed the Gnoll copper works. Sir Herbert Mackworth, 1st Baronet, Herbert's son, increased the amount of coal mining carried out on the estate. Through the widow of Sir Herbert's brother Robert Mackworth (died 1795), the estate passed to Capel Hanbury Leigh, Lord Lieutenant of Monmouthshire, and it was later bought by Henry Grant of Pembrokeshire (died 1831) Following his son's death, there was a plan to use the castle as a university college, but instead it was purchased by Charles Evan-Thomas of Llwynmadoc, who demolished the east wing and added other architectural features. He was the father of Admiral Hugh Evan-Thomas, who was born at the Gnoll. A year after Sir Hugh's death, the Gnoll was bought by Neath corporation as a site for a war memorial. The castle was demolished in 1957. An engraving of Gnoll Castle in about 1810 Country park The park features lakeside and woodland walks, restored formal cascades, a grotto, a coarse fishery, four ponds, a play area, an adventure playground and a visitor centre exploring the history and evolution of the estate. It has a shop, toilet facilities and a caf√®. Entry to the park is free of charge, but there are parking charges. The remains of some of the estate buildings, such as an ice house, tower and fishpond house, are still visible.  Hollow Tree  The Hollow Tree is located near to the visitor centre and the fishpond. It serves as the finish line for the three courses of the weekly Gnoll Parkrun. The tree, an oak, has been completely hollow since at least the 1950s and children have played inside it for generations. It is fitted with reinforcing bars and, despite its condition, continues to produce leaves and acorns each year. The tree was one of 216 nominations for the British Tree of the Year competition in 2017 and was selected by an expert panel to be one of six on the Welsh shortlist. It received 64% of votes in the subsequent public poll, winning the Welsh competition and receiving a ¬£1000 tree care grant from the People's Postcode Lottery. The tree was not selected from the national winners for entry into the European Tree of the Year competition, losing out to the Gilwell Oak.

From 1923 23 passenger aircraft were built LeO H-13A. Next, military variants were developed: reconnaissance-bomber LeO H-13B-3 and trainer LeO H-13E. They differed in fuselage configuration, because the H-13B-3 had an open cockpit for a pilot only behind a lower wing, while the H-13E had an open cockpit for a trainee and instructor seating side-by-side, in front of wings. Both had open machine gun positions in the nose and behind the wings. The H-13E could be also used as a reconnaissance aircraft. From late 1923 20 H-13B-3 were built (nos. 1-20) and 10 H-13E (nos. 21-30).

Service Passenger H-13A were used over the Mediterranean Sea. In the French Navy, H-13 were quickly withdrawn for training purpose, because of weak structure and low manufacturing quality. In 1924-1925 two H-13B3 and two H-13E were sold to Poland and used in Naval Aviation Unit (MDLot) in Puck from mid-1925. One of H-13E was used for a short time in a River Flotilla in Pi≈Ñsk. The first H-13B-3 no. 1-1 was withdrawn in 1929, next two (nos. 1-2 and 1-3) in 1931, while the last H-13E, no. 1-4, crashed on 29 July 1931 over the land near Puck. Description Two-engine biplane flying boat of wooden construction. Wooden framed fuselage, plywood covered, rectangular in cross-section, with a flat bottom with a single step. Two-spar rectangular wings, covered with plywood (in front) and canvas. A lower wing attached to the fuselage, an upper wing above it, mounted on struts, with two engines between wings, driving tractor propellers. Two floats under a lower wing.

The summit lies within Sussex County, New Jersey. Geography Wawayanda Mountain stretches over of land, consisting of deciduous forest with areas of scrub-shrub and coniferous woods. New Jersey Audubon Society Wawayanda Mountain and Pochuck Mountain to the west, form the borders of the Vernon Valley, an important farming and mining area of New Jersey drained by Pochuck Creek. Appalachian Trail The Appalachian Trail runs over the top of the ridge within Wawayanda State Park. Geology Wawayanda Mountain is part of the Reading Prong of the New England Uplands subprovince of the New England province of the Appalachian Highlands. The rocks that form Wawayanda Mountain are comprised from the same belt that make up nearby. This belt, i.e. the Reading Prong, consists of ancient crystalline metamorphic rocks. The New England province as a whole, along with the Blue Ridge province further south, are often together referred to as the Crystalline Appalachians. The Crystalline Appalachians extend as far north as the Green Mountains of Vermont and as far south as the Blue Ridge Mountains, although a portion of the belt remains below the Earth's surface through part of Pennsylvania. The Crystalline Appalachians are distinct from the parallel Sedimentary Appalachians which run from Georgia to New York. The nearby Kittatinny Mountains are representative of these sedimentary formations. Wildlife Mammals inhabiting Wawayanda Mountain include black bear and white-tailed deer.

A tropical rainforest climate or equatorial climate is a tropical climate usually found within 10 to 15 degrees latitude of the equator, and has at least of rainfall every month of the year. Regions with this climate are typically designated Af by the K√∂ppen climate classification. A tropical rainforest climate is typically hot, very humid, and wet. Description Tropical rain forests have a type of tropical climate in which there is no dry season--all months have an average precipitation value of at least . In rainforest climates the dry season is very short, and rainfall is normally heavy throughout the year. One day in a tropical rainforest climate can be very similar to the next, while the change in temperature between day and night may be larger than the average change in temperature during the year.  Equatorial climates vs. tropical trade-wind climates  When tropical rainforest climates are more dominated by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) than the trade winds (and with no or rare cyclones), so usually located near the equator, they are also called equatorial climates. Otherwise, when they are more dominated by the trade winds than the ITCZ, they are called tropical trade-wind climates. In pure equatorial climates, the atmospheric pressure is low, almost constant so the (horizontal) pressure gradient is low. Consequently the winds are rare and usually weak (except sea and land breezes in coastal areas) while in tropical trade-wind climates, often located at higher latitudes than the equatorial climates, wind is almost permanent which incidentally explains why rainforest formations are impoverished compared to those of equatorial climates due to their necessary resistance to strong winds accompanying tropical disturbances.Climatologie Pierre Estienne Alain Godard, pages 309 and 316 Notable cities with tropical rain forest climates Africa * Moroni, Comoros * Kisumu, Kenya * Harper, Liberia (equatorial climate) * Antalaha, Madagascar * Manakara, Madagascar * Kampala, Uganda Americas * Punta Gorda, Belize * Boca Raton, Florida, United States * Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States * Lim√≥n, Costa Rica * Hig√ºey, Dominican Republic * Puerto Barrios, Guatemala * La Ceiba, Honduras * Port Antonio, Jamaica * Havana, Cuba * Bluefields, Nicaragua * Changuinola, Panama * Manaus, Brazil (equatorial climate) * Bel√©m, Brazil * Maca√©, Brazil * Salvador, Brazil * Florencia, Colombia * Medell√≠n, Colombia * Puyo, Ecuador (equatorial climate) * Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, French Guiana (equatorial climate) * Georgetown, Guyana * Iquitos, Peru (equatorial climate) * Paramaribo, Suriname (equatorial climate) ''' Asia * Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei (equatorial climate) * Jayapura, Indonesia (equatorial climate) * Padang, Indonesia (equatorial climate) * Tangerang, Indonesia (equatorial climate) * Ishigaki, Japan * Johor Bahru, Malaysia (equatorial climate) * Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (equatorial climate) * Kuching, Malaysia (equatorial climate) * Davao City, Philippines (subequatorial climate) * Polomolok, Philippines (subequatorial climate) * Tacloban, Leyte, Philippines * Singapore (equatorial climate) * Kurunegala, Sri Lanka * Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, Sri Lanka (subequatorial climate) * Hualien, Taiwan * Orchid Island, Taiwan * Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand Oceania * Pago Pago, American Samoa * Innisfail, Australia * Palikir, Federated States of Micronesia * Suva, Fiji * Tarawa, Kiribati (subequatorial climate) * Majuro, Marshall Islands * Tabubil, Papua New Guinea (equatorial climate) * Lae, Papua New Guinea (equatorial climate) * Apia, Samoa * Honiara, Solomon Islands * Nuku‚Äôalofa, Tonga * Funafuti, Tuvalu * Hilo, United States * Port Vila, Vanuatu See also *Tropics *K√∂ppen climate classification References Category:K√∂ppen climate types Category:Rainforests Category:Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests Category:Tropical rainforests Climate, Rainforest ","title":"Tropical rainforest climate"},{"id":"18676894","text":"Order to cash (OTC or O2C) normally refers to one of the top-level (context level) business processes for receiving and processing customer orders.

Prelude  The army commanded by Juan Jos√© Castelli and Antonio Gonz√°lez Balcarce had their first encounter with the royalists under the command of General Jos√© Manuel de Goyeneche in October 1810. The royalist army did not press their advantage and did not pursue, and while retreating to the South, they had another encounter which they lost at Suipacha. The successful advance of the Primera Junta's troops continued to the North of Upper Peru and on June 20, 1811 they met again near the Desaguadero River where battle ensued.  Battle progress  On the morning of June 19, the revolutionary army had placed their troops in Huaqui, Caza and Machaca and built a temporary bridge over the Desaguadero River moving 1,200 troops across. The aim was to distract Goyeneche's troops on their front and right flank while surrounding the royalists on their rear through the lines established by this new bridge. General Goyeneche decided to effect a direct attack with his full force. At three in the morning of June 20 he ordered colonels Juan Ram√≠rez and Pablo Astete, lieutenant colonels Luis Astete and Mariano Lechuga (with 350 cavalry and four cannons) to attack Caza, near the road to Machaca and communication to Huaqui, while he marched towards Huaqui with colonels Francisco Picoaga and Ferm√≠n Pi√©rola commanding 300 cavalry, 40 guardsmen and 6 pieces of artillery. At dawn the heights on the hills the royalist troops needed to take were already teeming with revolutionary troops, cavalry and fusiliers who started shooting the Spaniards along with grenades and slingshots. The royalists responded and within a few hours made the revolutionaries retreat. When the independentist troops heard of Goyeneche's advance towards Huaqui, Castelli, Balcarce and Montes de Oca left the town with 15 artillery pieces and 2,000 men and took a strong position on the road to Huaqui between a small lake and the hills behind. Goyeneche ordered an advance under enemy fire while colonel Picoaga's battalion covered them with return fire. The independentist troops, recognizing General Goyeneche, directed their fire towards him, and he ordered one of his aides to transmit the order to attack with his right flank, also covering the road with Pi√©rola's battalion and detached three companies to advance on the front while he and the rest of his troops attacked through the left. The Argentine cavalry tried to stop the push but was overrun and fled, along with the whole rebel army towards Huaqui. Goyeneche ordered pursuit and subsequently captured the town. Colonel Ram√≠rez soon after sent a messenger informing them of victory at Caza. The battle ended with the Argentine troops in full retreat, with more than 1000 men lost and abandoning most of their artillery. In full run they took refuge in Potos√≠ and later on farther south in Jujuy.  Consequences  At the same time, on June 20, 1811 a revolution that was previously prepared, started in Per√∫. Their leader Francisco Antonio De Zela had agreed with the Argentine troops that while he started the revolution in Tacna, the Argentine army would advance towards Peru to initiate the liberation campaign on that country, but the defeat at Huaqui stopped the plans on Peruvian territory. The bad impression that this defeat caused in Buenos Aires, where they had lost their guns, resulted in Gonz√°lez Balcarce and Castelli being relieved of their commands and court-martialed. The defeat also caused a cease-fire of the fight in Montevideo due to the concern in Buenos Aires of being attacked from two fronts at the same time. The independentist's defeat at Huaqui was of such magnitude that the weakness created in the north after the battle forced them to name General Belgrano to take control of the Army of the North and try to re-establish discipline, train the troops and wait for new armament. It forced him to take extreme measures and mobilize Northern Argentina's population in Jujuy Province towards the south before the imminent Spanish offensive. This episode is known in history as the Jujuy Exodus (Spanish:√âxodo Juje√±o).  Bibliography  * D√≠az Venteo, Fernando. Las campa√±as militares del Virrey Abascal.

Reception The philosopher Rupert Read called the book worthless, and wrote that it presented an over-simplified and distorted view of both Popper and Kuhn. The Economist wrote that the book was not thorough enough to be convincing. The mass circulation US magazine Popular Science made the book Book of the Month in February 2005.

The open pit was then 2.5 kilometers across. Southern Copper Corporation is a mining company that was founded in 1952. The current incarnation of Southern Copper can be traced to the 2005 acquisition of Mexican copper producer Minera M√©xico by Southern Peru Copper Corporation. 88.9 percent of Southern Copper is owned by Mexican mining conglomerate Grupo M√©xico (per proxy statement dated March 27,2018) . Based on 2007 reserves data, Southern Copper is the world's largest publicly traded copper mining company and the world's seventh largest copper mining company based on 2007 sales. In addition, the firm is the eighth largest copper smelting company. The firm ranks among the world's largest producers of molybdenum, silver, and zinc. The company is a major producer and refiner of copper, molybdenum, zinc, silver, lead, and gold, and operates mines and smelters in Mexico and in Peru, in the Andes mountains southeast of Lima. Since 2012, the company has made major strides in improving their production methods. During 2013, 60.7 million dollars in environmental capital expenditures were spent on the following programs: water recovery systems to conserve water and minimize impact on nearby streams; vegetation programs to stabilize the surface of the tailings dumps; implementation of scrubbing technology in the mines to reduce dust emissions. For these continued efforts towards sustainable practices, the company was awarded with the Fray International Sustainability Award in 2014. CEO M. Oscar Gonzalez Rocha, appeared in Mexico for the SIPS 2014/Shechtman International Symposium to accept this award on the company's behalf. Major operations The firm's operations are primarily within southern Peru and northern Mexico. Operations in southern Peru Southern Peruvian operations include the mines located at the Cuajone and Toquepala mines. The two mines produced a total of 359,655 tons of copper in 2007, with Cuajone producing 182,117 tons and Toquepala producing 177,538 tons respectively. A recent strike at the largest mine, Cuajone, was suspended pending mediation between the two parties. Tia Maria is a copper project mine which has been granted the environmental approval by the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mining (MINEM) to move forward with the project development. Geoservice Ingenier√≠a was the engineering and consulting firm in charge of executing satisfactory the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies, the EIA approval was received on August 1, 2014 with directorial resolution N¬∫392-2014-MEM/DGA-AM given by MINEM. The social protest against the project started in March 2015, causing tens of injuries and up to the beginning of May 2015, two deaths have also led to massive strikes and road blocks in the region. Local farmers fear the open-pit project will contaminate water supplies and cover their crops in dust.http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-tia-maria-conflict-takes-another- life-106100 Operations in Mexico The Cananea Mine, located in northern Mexico, produced 98,503 tons of copper in 2007. It is among the world's largest copper mines in terms of reserves, and has the longest remaining mine life of any major open-pit copper mine in the world, based on current production levels. La Caridad Mine, located in northern Mexico, produced 124,972 tons of copper in 2007.

The three Euler rotations are one way to bring a rigid body to any desired orientation by sequentially making rotations about axis' fixed relative to the object. However, this can also be achieved with one single rotation (Euler's rotation theorem). Using the concepts of linear algebra it is shown how this single rotation can be performed. Mathematical formulation Let :\\\\hat e_1\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat e_2\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat e_3 be a coordinate system fixed in the body that through a change in orientation is brought to the new directions :\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\hat e_1\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\hat e_2\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\hat e_3.

Rotation around an axis Let :\\\\hat e_1\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat e_2\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat e_3 be an orthogonal positively oriented base vector system in R^3. The linear operator \\"Rotation with the angle \\\\theta around the axis defined by \\\\hat e_3\\" has the matrix representation : \\\\begin{bmatrix} Y_1 \\\\ Y_2 \\\\ Y_3 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta & -\\\\sin\\\\theta & 0 \\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta & \\\\cos\\\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} X_1 \\\\ X_2 \\\\ X_3 \\\\end{bmatrix} relative to this basevector system. This then means that a vector : \\\\bar x=\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\hat e_1 & \\\\hat e_2 & \\\\hat e_3 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} X_1 \\\\ X_2 \\\\ X_3 \\\\end{bmatrix} is rotated to the vector : \\\\bar y=\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\hat e_1 & \\\\hat e_2 & \\\\hat e_3 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} Y_1 \\\\ Y_2 \\\\ Y_3 \\\\end{bmatrix} by the linear operator. The determinant of this matrix is : \\\\det \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta & -\\\\sin\\\\theta & 0\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta & \\\\cos\\\\theta & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}=1 and the characteristic polynomial is : \\\\begin{align} \\\\det\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta -\\\\lambda & -\\\\sin\\\\theta & 0 \\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta & \\\\cos\\\\theta -\\\\lambda & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1-\\\\lambda \\\\end{bmatrix} &=\\\\big({(\\\\cos\\\\theta -\\\\lambda)}^2 + {\\\\sin\\\\theta}^2 \\\\big)(1-\\\\lambda) \\\\ &=-\\\\lambda^3+(2\\\\ \\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\ +\\\\ 1)\\\\ \\\\lambda^2 - (2\\\\ \\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\ +\\\\ 1)\\\\ \\\\lambda +1 \\\\ \\\\end{align} The matrix is symmetric if and only if \\\\sin\\\\theta=0, i.e. for \\\\theta=0 and for \\\\theta=\\\\pi. The case \\\\theta=0 is the trivial case of an identity operator. For the case \\\\theta=\\\\pi the characteristic polynomial is : -(\\\\lambda-1){(\\\\lambda +1)}^2 i.e. the rotation operator has the eigenvalues : \\\\lambda=1 \\\\quad \\\\lambda=-1 The eigenspace corresponding to \\\\lambda=1 is all vectors on the rotation axis, i.e. all vectors : \\\\bar x =\\\\alpha \\\\ \\\\hat e_3 \\\\quad -\\\\infty <\\\\alpha < \\\\infty The eigenspace corresponding to \\\\lambda=-1 consists of all vectors orthogonal to the rotation axis, i.e. all vectors : \\\\bar x =\\\\alpha \\\\ \\\\hat e_1 + \\\\beta \\\\ \\\\hat e_2 \\\\quad -\\\\infty <\\\\alpha < \\\\infty \\\\quad -\\\\infty <\\\\beta < \\\\infty For all other values of \\\\theta the matrix is un-symmetric and as {\\\\sin\\\\theta}^2 > 0 there is only the eigenvalue \\\\lambda=1 with the one-dimensional eigenspace of the vectors on the rotation axis: : \\\\bar x =\\\\alpha \\\\ \\\\hat e_3 \\\\quad -\\\\infty <\\\\alpha < \\\\infty The rotation matrix by angle \\\\theta around a general axis of rotation \\\\mathbf{k} = \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{ccc} k_1 \\\\ k_2 \\\\ k_3 \\\\end{array}\\\\right] is given by Rodrigues' rotation formula. : R = I \\\\cos\\\\theta + [\\\\mathbf{k}]_\\\\times \\\\sin\\\\theta + (1 - \\\\cos\\\\theta) \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\mathbf{k}^\\\\mathsf{T} , where I is the identity matrix and [\\\\mathbf{k}]_\\\\times is the dual 2-form of \\\\mathbf{k} or cross product matrix, : [\\\\mathbf{k}]_\\\\times = \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{ccc} 0 & -k_3 & k_2 \\\\ k_3 & 0 & -k_1 \\\\ -k_2 & k_1 & 0 \\\\end{array}\\\\right] . Note that [\\\\mathbf{k}]_\\\\times satisfies [\\\\mathbf{k}]_\\\\times \\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\mathbf{k}\\\\times\\\\mathbf{v} for all \\\\mathbf{v}. The general case The operator \\"Rotation with the angle \\\\theta around a specified axis\\" discussed above is an orthogonal mapping and its matrix relative to any base vector system is therefore an orthogonal matrix . Furthermore its determinant has the value 1. A non-trivial fact is the opposite, i.e. that for any orthogonal linear mapping in R^3 having determinant = 1 there exist base vectors :\\\\hat e_1\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat e_2\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat e_3 such that the matrix takes the \\"canonical form\\" : \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta & -\\\\sin\\\\theta & 0 \\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta & \\\\cos\\\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1\\\\end{bmatrix} for some value of \\\\theta. In fact, if a linear operator has the orthogonal matrix : \\\\begin{bmatrix} A_{11} & A_{12} & A_{13} \\\\ A_{21} & A_{22} & A_{23} \\\\ A_{31} & A_{32} & A_{33} \\\\end{bmatrix} relative some base vector system :\\\\hat f_1\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat f_2\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat f_3 and this matrix is symmetric, the \\"Symmetric operator theorem\\" valid in R^n (any dimension) applies saying that it has n orthogonal eigenvectors. This means for the 3-dimensional case that there exists a coordinate system :\\\\hat e_1\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat e_2\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat e_3 such that the matrix takes the form : \\\\begin{bmatrix} B_{11} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & B_{22} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & B_{33} \\\\end{bmatrix} As it is an orthogonal matrix these diagonal elements B_{ii} are either 1 or ‚àí1\\\\. As the determinant is 1 these elements are either all 1 or one of the elements is 1 and the other two are ‚àí1\\\\. In the first case it is the trivial identity operator corresponding to \\\\theta=0. In the second case it has the form : \\\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} if the basevectors are numbered such that the one with eigenvalue 1 has index 3. This matrix is then of the desired form for \\\\theta=\\\\pi. If the matrix is un-symmetric, the vector : \\\\bar E = \\\\alpha_1\\\\ \\\\hat f_1 + \\\\alpha_2\\\\ \\\\hat f_2 + \\\\alpha_3\\\\ \\\\hat f_3 where :\\\\alpha_1=\\\\frac{A_{32}-A_{23} }{2} :\\\\alpha_2=\\\\frac{A_{13}-A_{31}}{2} :\\\\alpha_3=\\\\frac{A_{21}-A_{12}}{2} is non-zero. This vector is an eigenvector with eigenvalue : \\\\lambda=1 Setting : \\\\hat e_3=\\\\frac{\\\\bar E}{\\\\bar E} and selecting any two orthogonal unit vectors in the plane orthogonal to \\\\hat e_3: :\\\\hat e_1\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat e_2 such that :\\\\hat e_1\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat e_2,\\\\ \\\\hat e_3 form a positively oriented triple, the operator takes the desired form with :\\\\cos \\\\theta=\\\\frac{A_{11}+A_{22}+A_{33}-1}{2} :\\\\sin \\\\theta=\\\\bar{E} The expressions above are in fact valid also for the case of a symmetric rotation operator corresponding to a rotation with \\\\theta = 0 or \\\\theta = \\\\pi. But the difference is that for \\\\theta = \\\\pi the vector : \\\\bar E = \\\\alpha_1\\\\ \\\\hat f_1 + \\\\alpha_2\\\\ \\\\hat f_2 + \\\\alpha_3\\\\ \\\\hat f_3 is zero and of no use for finding the eigenspace of eigenvalue 1, i.e. the rotation axis. Defining E_4 as \\\\cos \\\\theta the matrix for the rotation operator is : \\\\frac{1-E_4}{{E_1}^2+{E_2}^2+{E_3}^2} \\\\begin{bmatrix} E_1 E_1 & E_1 E_2 & E_1 E_3 \\\\ E_2 E_1 & E_2 E_2 & E_2 E_3 \\\\ E_3 E_1 & E_3 E_2 & E_3 E_3 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\+ \\\\begin{bmatrix} E_4 & -E_3 & E_2 \\\\ E_3 & E_4 & -E_1 \\\\ -E_2 & E_1 & E_4 \\\\end{bmatrix} provided that : {E_1}^2+{E_2}^2+{E_3}^2 > 0 i.e. except for the cases \\\\theta=0 (the identity operator) and \\\\theta=\\\\pi Quaternions Quaternions are defined similar to E_1\\\\ ,\\\\ E_2\\\\ ,\\\\ E_3\\\\ ,\\\\ E_4 with the difference that the half angle \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} is used instead of the full angle \\\\theta. This means that the first 3 components q_1\\\\ ,\\\\ q_2\\\\ ,\\\\ q_3\\\\ are components of a vector defined from : q_1\\\\ \\\\hat{f_1}\\\\ +\\\\ q_2\\\\ \\\\hat{f_2}\\\\ +\\\\ \\\\ q_3\\\\ \\\\hat{f_1}\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\sin \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\quad \\\\hat{e_3}=\\\\frac{\\\\sin \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}}{\\\\sin\\\\theta}\\\\quad \\\\bar E and that the fourth component is the scalar : q_4=\\\\cos \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} As the angle \\\\theta defined from the canonical form is in the interval :0 \\\\le \\\\theta \\\\le \\\\pi one would normally have that q_4 \\\\ge 0. But a \\"dual\\" representation of a rotation with quaternions is used, i.e. :q_1\\\\ ,\\\\ q_2\\\\ ,\\\\ q_3\\\\ ,\\\\ q_4\\\\ and :-q_1\\\\ ,\\\\ -q_2\\\\ ,\\\\ -q_3\\\\ ,\\\\ -q_4\\\\ are two alternative representations of one and the same rotation. The entities E_k are defined from the quaternions by : E_1=2 q_4 q_1 : E_2=2 q_4 q_2 : E_3=2 q_4 q_3 : E_4={q_4}^2 -({q_1}^2+{q_2}^2+{q_3}^2) Using quaternions the matrix of the rotation operator is :\\\\begin{bmatrix} 2({q_1}^2+{q_4}^2)-1 &2({q_1}{q_2}-{q_3}{q_4}) &2({q_1}{q_3}+{q_2}{q_4}) \\\\ 2({q_1}{q_2}+{q_3}{q_4}) &2({q_2}^2+{q_4}^2)-1 &2({q_2}{q_3}-{q_1}{q_4}) \\\\ 2({q_1}{q_3}-{q_2}{q_4}) &2({q_2}{q_3}+{q_1}{q_4}) &2({q_3}^2+{q_4}^2)-1 \\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} Numerical example Consider the reorientation corresponding to the Euler angles \\\\alpha=10^\\\\circ \\\\quad \\\\beta=20^\\\\circ \\\\quad \\\\gamma=30^\\\\circ \\\\quad relative a given base vector system :\\\\hat f_1\\\\ ,\\\\ \\\\hat f_2,\\\\ \\\\hat f_3 Corresponding matrix relative to this base vector system is (see Euler angles#Matrix orientation) : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0.771281 & -0.633718 & 0.059391 \\\\ 0.613092 & 0.714610 & -0.336824 \\\\ 0.171010 & 0.296198 & 0.939693 \\\\end{bmatrix} and the quaternion is : (0.171010,\\\\ -0.030154,\\\\ 0.336824,\\\\ 0.925417) The canonical form of this operator : \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta & -\\\\sin\\\\theta & 0\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\theta & \\\\cos\\\\theta & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} with \\\\theta=44.537^\\\\circ is obtained with :\\\\hat e_3=(0.451272,-0.079571,0.888832) The quaternion relative to this new system is then : (0,\\\\ 0,\\\\ 0.378951,\\\\ 0.925417) = (0,\\\\ 0,\\\\ \\\\sin\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2},\\\\ \\\\cos\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2}) Instead of making the three Euler rotations :10^\\\\circ,20^\\\\circ,30^\\\\circ the same orientation can be reached with one single rotation of size 44.537^\\\\circ around \\\\hat e_3 References * .

Huffman (born 17 July 1944) is Professor Emeritus of archaeology in association with the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. He specialises in pre-colonial farming societies in southern Africa. Huffman is most well known for his identification of the Central Cattle Pattern at Mapungubwe, a pre-colonial state in southern Africa. This, in turn he argued as the main influence in the formation of the Zimbabwe Pattern at Great Zimbabwe.Huffman, T.N. 2001. The Central Cattle Pattern and interpreting the past. Southern African Humanities 13: 19‚Äì35. Arguably his seminal contribution to the field was A Handbook to the Iron Age: The Archaeology of Pre-Colonial Farming Societies in Southern Africa (2007), which has contributed to the understanding of ceramic style analysis and culture history focusing on these groups.Huffman, T.N. 2007. A Handbook to the Iron Age: The Archaeology of Pre-Colonial Farming Societies in Southern Africa. Pietermaritzburg: University of KwaZulu-Natal Press.  Biography = Personal history  :Huffman was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin on 17 July 1944. As a child, he and his family moved to Texas and then again to Oklahoma where they settled. Since the Oklahoma state was former Native American territory, he became especially interested in the Native American past. As a result he became interested in the field of archaeology. At the age of 13, Huffman and his family moved to Colorado for employment opportunity reasons.  Career  :In 1966 he attended University of Denver where he received a BA in Anthropology. He then went on to do his MA and PhD at the University of Illinois in 1968 and 1974 respectively. While at Illinois, he studied under Brian Fagan whom he accompanied to Zambia in 1967, an event that piqued his interest in pre-colonial farming societies in southern Africa. For his doctoral thesis, Huffman examined a southern African Middle Iron Age group (Leopard's Kopje).Huffman, T.N. 1974. The Leopard's Kopje Tradition. Salisbury: National Museums and Monuments (Memoir 6). 150p. :Huffman joined the Historical Monuments Commission in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in 1970, acting as Keeper/Inspector of Monuments. Seven years later he relocated to South Africa, where he took up the position of Head of Department in Archaeology at the University of the Witwatersrand. He remained based at the University of the Witwatersrand until 2009, at which point he retired as Professor Emeritus. Huffman is still active in research, however. = Influences = :Huffman's work has been influenced by scholars such as David Lewis-Williams, Donald Lathrap and Adam Kuper. = Theoretical underpinnings = :As a cultural anthropologist, Huffman makes use of ethnographic data from descendant groups as well as outside, colonial sources, to understand the beliefs and practices of past peoples. This avenue of research is augmented with the use multiple hypothesis testing. It was proposed by Huffman that settlement patterns could provide insight into understanding these prehistoric societies. It was this realisation that led to the creation of the Central Cattle Pattern.Huffman, T.N. 2001. The Central Cattle Pattern and interpreting the past. Southern African Humanities 13: 19‚Äì35. :Physical manifestations of prehistoric beliefs and values through the organisation of spaces and ritual areas provide insight into beliefs and practices. Huffman argues that this is possible because peoples divide their spaces into specific areas reserved for various activities. These spaces shape cultural relationships. For Huffman this is evidenced and supported by the study of ethnographic data. = Contributions to the field  Iron Age archaeology in southern Africa  :Huffman's main contributions to southern African Iron Age archaeology are his analysis of ceramic styles to understand cultural processes and the analysis of settlement patterns as a means of understanding the worldviews of pre- colonial cultures. This research was employed by Huffman to argue for the origins of the Zimbabwe Pattern as coming from the Central Cattle Pattern at Mapungubwe.Huffman, T.N. 2001. The Central Cattle Pattern and interpreting the past. Southern African Humanities 13: 19‚Äì35. :By using these culture- historical approaches, Huffman reconstructs major drought episodes within the Iron Age. Examination of burnt grain bins and houses, led Huffman to argue that the practice of this burning was linked to rituals whereby these structures were burnt to cleanse the possessions of those who were thought to be responsible for drought.Huffman, T.N. 2009. A cultural proxy for drought: ritual burning in the Iron Age of Southern Africa. Journal of Archaeological Science 36: 991‚Äì1005. Independent data correlated with these rituals, and this data was employed to discuss episodes of drought in both southern Africa and South America.  Critiques  :Huffman's research on Bantu agro- pastoralist society and his interpretations of the archaeology of Great Zimbabwe has sparked much debate. Some scholars have highlighted concerns that Huffman's use of broad structuralist models when arguing the Central Cattle Pattern place too much emphasis on the general, therefore not closing in on more specific questions of individual Early Iron Age settlements.Pikirayi, I. & Chirikure, S. 2011. Debating Great Zimbabwe. Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa 46(2):221‚Äì231 :Others have taken issue with the argument that Early Iron Age settlements were able to remain much the same throughout the Early Iron Age, and call for explanations as to how these agro-pastoralist groups were able to maintain similar structural relationships for two thousand years.Beach, D. 1998.

Azania: Archaeological research in Africa 29/30:51-64 This model also excludes problems of interactions with outside foraging groups.  Current research  :Huffman‚Äôs current research in southern Africa follows two main veins: population dynamics and cultural boundaries/changes. This research is being conducted within the Mapungubwe ‚Äòcore area‚Äô (as defined by Huffman himself). This area, physiographically, covers the Karoo environment, granites and a metamorphic zone. His work on population dynamics involves a systematic survey of the area for Iron Age sites. From this Huffman charts population changes through time. :In terms of his work on the origins of Venda identity he examines ceramic styles and changes therein and the cultural boundaries between Shona and Sotho-Tswana, which may have led to the development of this Venda identity.

It was not selected for squadron service and only the single prototype was built Background The design of the Bullpup was an outcome of a series of design studies for a fighter undertaken by Frank Barnwell during the 1920s. In 1924 Barnwell had started work on a fighter powered by the Rolls-Royce Falcon to meet the requirements of specification F.17/24. This project was shelved since Bristol preferred to use their own engine designs, but was revived in 1926 when Barnwell started work on a design, designated the Bristol 102, to meet either F.9/26 for a day-and-night fighter or N.21/26 for a shipborne fighter. A subsequent proposal, designated Type 105 was for another aircraft to meet F.9/26, powered by the Mercury engine then under development at Bristol. These proposals were sufficient for a pair of mockups to be constructed for inspection by the Air Ministry in February 1927. The two aircraft were similar in design, the interceptor to specification F.17/24 design being slightly smaller and lighter and not equipped with radio. As a result, Bristol was asked to revise the design so that it met a later interceptor specification, F.20/27. Subsequently, a prototype was ordered for evaluation, but the other design did not gain official backing. Nevertheless, Bristol considered it promising enough to build a prototype to be entered for the F.9/26 trials as a private venture, powered by a Bristol Jupiter because the supply of Mercurys was expected to be limited. This became the Bristol BulldogBarnes 1988 p.212 Design and development The Type 107 was an unequal span single bay biplane powered by a 480 hp (360 kW) Bristol Mercury air-cooled radial engine driving a two-bladed propeller. The structure was all-metal with a fabric covering, using members built up from rolled high-tensile steel strips riveted together. In order to optimise the pilot's field of view there was large semi-circular cutout in the trailing edge of the upper wing and the inboard section of the lower wing was of reduced chord. Frise ailerons were fitted to the top wing only. It was armed with a pair of 0.303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis guns mounted on either side of the cockpit. The prototype first flew on 28 April 1928, powered by a Bristol Jupiter engine since a flight-ready Mercury was not yet available, and the aircraft was not delivered to Martlesham Heath for evaluation until March 1929.Barnes 1964, p. 221. The Bullpup prototype was subsequently fitted with a Jupiter F type head with twin compensator rods for the penthouse heads. Trials with this engine were carried out at Martlesham in 1929.\\"Bristol Bullpup.\\" The Transport Archive. Retrieved: 1 August 2008. Operational history Performance at the F.20/27 competition held in 1929 was respectable but in the event none of the competitors was to enter service, the requirement eventually being met by the Hawker Fury, a Rolls-Royce Kestrel-engined development of the Hawker F.20/27 contender. The prototype was used as an engine test aircraft until it was scrapped in 1935 at the end of the Bristol Aquila development programme. SpecificationsReferences=NotesBibliography * Barnes, C.H.

Accessed August 1, 2008.  History = Early history of the site  During the early years of New York City, the current site to Riverside Park was largely undeveloped, consisting of rocky outcroppings and steep bluffs along the Hudson River shoreline. Prior to European arrival, American Indians sparsely populated this rough terrain.Jackson, Kenneth T. The Encyclopedia of New York City New Haven: Yale UP, 2010. Print. In 1846 the Hudson River Railroad laid tracks across the Hudson River shoreline to speed the transport of goods from Albany to Manhattan. In 1865, William R. Martin, a commissioner on the Board of Central Park proposed a scenic drive and park along the Hudson River. During the next two years New York City acquired land between the Hudson River Railroad and the bluffs along the shoreline, and in 1873 the New York City Park Board commissioned Riverside Park. The co-designer of Central Park, Frederick Law Olmsted, was named lead designer. His design, which was accepted in 1875, included a winding drive for horses and sight-seeing, as well as pedestrian walkways, both accessible from the neighborhoods to the east. The park was completed by Olmsted's successor Calvert Vaux, but was soon surrounded by coal bins, shacks and garbage dumps.  Robert Moses era  Seen from the Hudson River Greenway By 1921, Riverside Park had deteriorated to an expanse of mud. Barbed-wire fences cut the citizens off from the waterfront. In the early 1920s, the architecture firm of McKim, Mead and White had submitted a proposal with an elevated traffic circle, covering the railroad tracks beneath. The traffic circle was partially built, and portions of a highway were also under construction on Manhattan's West Side. This drew the attention of citizens and politicians to this neglected area. The City of New York announced the West Side Improvement Project in 1934. Robert Moses was at this time New York City's parks commissioner, and he took over the project. Moses expanded it into a grand architectural multi-level entry and exit from the Henry Hudson Parkway, all under the name of the \\"79th Street Grade Crossing Elimination Structure\\".. The multi-level structure was designed by Gilmore David Clarke. Moses was able to raise $109,000,000 to begin the project. for which the Works Projects Administration provided the equivalent of $ million today. Moses hired the architect and engineer Clinton Lyod to work on the structural elements with the landscape architect, Gilmore Clarke, to work on the landscape.. The structure was built mostly from concrete, but the above-ground part is clad in cut stone. The initial McKim, Mead and White plan had called for rough-cut, dark stone to be applied to the exterior of the building, but Clinton Lyod modified their plan and used lighter, finer cut stone. The project created the Freedom Tunnel, an underground parking garage, a restaurant, and the marina. The rotunda was designed to hold the weight of the heavily used traffic circle that sits atop the building. The large support columns are visible inside the caf√©.Henry Hudson Parkway.

Adjacent rotunda The 79th Street Rotunda, planned and built by former New York City Parks Department Commissioner Robert Moses during the West Side Highway's conversion into a parkway, is a traffic circle that sits next to the boat basin. between the Hudson River and the Henry Hudson Parkway at the western edge of 79th Street. The rotunda was built to allow easy access and exit to and from the Henry Hudson Highway. There are two ways to access the site by foot: one way is to walk along Riverside Park, and the other is to walk west on 79th Street. Drivers briefly drive atop the rotunda's traffic circle as they exit the Henry Hudson Parkway or enter the Parkway from 79th Street. The rotunda's interior, open-air courtyard is able to block noise and views of the highway, while blocking noise and views of the highway for the park and boat marina below. Moses viewed the project with grand monumentality, while believing it would add to the grandeur and allure of New York City as viewed from across the Hudson River from New Jersey's Hudson River Palisades. The Rotunda was a core part of the project.Caro, Robert A. The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York. New York: Vintage, 1975. Print.

They may be recognised as large mounds above or near the surface of the landscape. Like other similar-looking phenomena, such as Mima mounds and fairy circles, from which they have been poorly distinguished, particularly in early literature, they have been the subject of a wide range of speculation and of debate that has not yet been settled conclusively. Detail of heuweltjies near Klawer, showing typical denuded surface Heuweltjies showing invasion by vegetation Causes It is quite certain that not all types of heuweltjies have the same cause and nature. For one thing, the various organisms and circumstances that have been proposed to cause them do not occur throughout their range. For another, they differ in nature; some for example have been seen as improving soil fertility, an opinion documented at least as long ago as the early 20th century, whereas others seem to inhibit plant growth. Possible theories and discussions on the topic include the following: Fossil termite mounds One theory is that heuweltjies are fossil termite mounds. Within this hypothesis, there are two conflicting opinions on the origins of heuweltjies, one maintaining that heuweltjies were built by the harvester termite Microhodotermes viator, the other that heuweltjies were built by a now possibly extinct termite species.Midgley, J. J.; Harris, C.; Hesse, H.; Swift, A. Heuweltjie age and vegetation change based on 13C and 14C analyses. South African Journal of Science;Mar/Apr2002, Vol. 98 Issue 3/4, p202. (A study estimating heuweltjie age from calcrete from near the Clanwilliam Dam in South Africa.) The earliest radiocarbon dates on heuweltjies suggest an age of about 30,000 or even 40,000 B.P. Mole-rats and/or termites Another theory is that heuweltjies are created by burrowing (fossorial) animals. Variants of this hypothesis are that the animals are mole-rats in the families Bathyergidae and Rhizomyinae; termites; or a combination of mole-rats and termites. In a review paper, Walter Whitford and Fenton Kay state that while the mounds appear to have been created by termites, mammals (aardvarks) partially maintain the mounds by feeding on and living in them. They show a (log-log) correlation between the surface area of mounds including Mima mounds, badger digs, bison wallows, mole-rat, prairie-dog and banner-tail kangaroo rat mounds, with the longevity of the disturbance ('biopedturbation', i.e. disturbance of soil by living agents including animals, roots, etc.): a heuweltjie of 100‚Äì1000 square metres is 1000‚Äì10,000 years old. Differential erosion Yet another theory is that heuweltjies are caused by differential erosion in places where the availability of water limits the growth of vegetation, creating natural patterns such as tiger bush. In favour of this theory, Michael Cramer and his colleagues note that heuweltjies contain at least ten times more soil than any termite nests in South Africa, and that they can occur on bedrock, which termites could not be tunnelling through to move soil upwards. Further, the heuweltjies had the same spatial distribution as bush-clumps, patches of woody vegetation forming patterns. They suggest that heuweltjies formed from bush- clumps as these protected the soil from eroding away, producing calcrete hardpans. Nature Paper explanation In 2017 Corina Tarnita and colleagues published a paper in Nature which explained these and other related self- organised vegetation patterns by means of a general theory which integrates scale-dependent feedbacks and the activities of subterranean ecosystem engineers such as termites, ants, and rodents. Effects Heuweltjies modify their local environment, creating a patchwork of habitats in the Nama Karoo ecosystem. Soils in heuweltjies are finer-grained, contain more water, and are more alkaline than surrounding soils, and they support differing animal and plant communities. Both aardvark and steenbok use heuweltjies as dung middens; they are often colonised by Brant's whistling rats (Parotomys brantsii), and sheep graze and leave dung on them.

Flight testing revealed serious problems, and the project was abandoned. Development The Bagshot was built to Air Ministry Specification F.4/24 in December 1924. This called for a large twin-engined fighter aircraft with a crew of three (pilot and two gunners), a maximum speed of and a landing speed of .Mason 1992, p. 191. Initially the details of the required armament were not specified. Frank Barnwell's design to meet this requirement, the Bagshot, was a high-wing all-metal monoplane with an unusual triangular- section fabric-covered steel-tube fuselage with two upper longerons and a single lower member. The pilot sat in line with the wing's leading edge, with one gun position in the nose and another just behind the wing. The two-spar wing had a steel primary structure and duralumin nose ribs and end-members, and was a semi-cantilever, being braced by a pair of diagonal struts on each side. The legs of the fixed undercarriage met the wing at the same place as the struts and had an axle fairing of airfoil section, contributing some lift. Power was provided by two wing-mounted Bristol Jupiter VI engines. In September 1925 the Air Ministry amended the specification, calling for superchargers on the engines, increased fuel load and a higher top speed at altitude. Barnwell attended a design conference to discuss these new demands and was told that the purpose of the aircraft was to carry a pair of Coventry Ordnance Works 37mm (1.460 in) cannon, (generally called COW guns). When Barnwell subsequently received the full details of the required equipment, which called for two Lewis guns in addition to the main armament, he realised that the aircraft would be overweight and have a landing speed of . He suggested making an alternative fuselage of rolled steel strip in order to save weight, abandoning the project as a waste of time if load testing of this proved unsatisfactory. However, the Air Ministry declined to cancel the contract and the Bagshot was completed, being provisionally accepted by the Air Ministry on 12 May 1927 and assigned serial number J7767. Operational history The Bagshot was first flown without any armament at Filton on 15 July 1927 by Cyril Uwins, Bristol's chief test pilot.Russell, p. 20. This first flight was short: 'Always a bad sign' remarked Archibald Russell (later Sir Archibald), who at that time was working in the stress calculations office at Filton. Uwins reported that control in the roll axis was poor. A second flight, during which Uwins pushed the speed up to 100 mph, revealed that the problem became worse as speed increased. Uwins was unable to observe the wing's behaviour (He had a damaged neck thanks to an aircraft accident). It was decided that the aircraft was safe enough to carry an observer if the speed was kept down, and Russell, who had recently been working on measuring the deflection of the aircraft's wing spars under load, was given the job. The rear gun position gave an excellent view of the wing. Uwins and Russell agreed on a simple system of hand signals in order to communicate. By the time the aircraft reached the agreed speed and height for the trials Russell was already very concerned. But although the \\"writhing movements\\"Russell, p. 21. of the wing were \\"large and alarming\\" he had no signal to tell Uwins that enough was enough, and so the whole planned flight program was flown. It was concluded that control reversal resulting from twisting of the wing when the ailerons were applied was the cause of the problems. The aircraft was grounded for a structural test to be made. Subsequently, it was transferred to the Air Ministry's experimental unit and briefly flown during 1931, but shortly afterwards broken up for scrap.

Mellor (born in Yorkshire, UK) is a British scientist probably best known for his 1989 \\"unified vacuole theory\\".  Unified vacuole theory  The theory states that in plant endosymbioses, the micro-symbiont and the macro- symbiont generally share their lytic vacuolar compartments. This stems from Mellor's earlier 1988 symbiosome (or \\"symbiosome is a lysosome\\") theory, which states that the organelle that microsymbionts inhabit partially takes over the lysosomal functions in these plant cells. These plant cells are analogous to the role of protein bodies in seeds, in particular that the rhizobial symbiosome is an organ-specific form of lysosome or vacuole in legume root nodules.  The Marburg and Basel Years (plant biology)  Mellor was interested in how plants distinguish between symbiotic and pathogenic infections. In 1984, he set about measuring defence responses including Phytoalexin and Chitinase in nodules infected with different rhizobial mutants. Gradually, he observed that in Rhizobia, the nod genes are responsible for producing different nod factors (lipo-chitin molecules). Among many other effects he also observed that they can provoke plant defence responses, so that it is essential that these genes be switched off after infection, or symbiosis could not take place. This model won general acclaim, and the paper with David Collingehttps://plen.ku.dk/english/employees/?pure=en/persons/11699 was later reprinted (Mellor and Collinge, 1995) as that year‚Äôs number one most important publication in the area of Plant Sciences. In other works, Mellor has claimed that in legumes the root nodule cytoplasm may be under water stress and the plant may combat this by using the bacterial/fungal (in the case of vesicular arbuscular mycorrhiza) disaccharide sugar trehalose. The concept has been repeatedly confirmed, and this effect explains why nodulated plants have a higher drought tolerance than non-nodulated plants.  The G√∂ttingen Years (environmental nanotech)  Mellor was also interested in applied science, and after leaving the University of Basel he became director of research and development at a German chemical company. There he led the group that invented and patented a system to power immobilized oxido-reductase enzymes and artificial co-factors using electrical power from a domestic socket. Twenty- five years later, the authors Eltarahony et al. stated in their round-up review paper that \\"... Mellor et al. [1992] pioneered the concept of current promotion, electrode bioreactor and denitrification control, this concept, [is now] widely used to treat different types of wastewater, such as toxic and refractory organic wastewater as well as wastewater containing heavy metal ions\\".  The London Years (computing and maths)  In early 2000, Mellor joined and helped start-up IT the University of Copenhagen, alongside Mads Tofte and others. In 2005 he became Director of Enterprise at Kingston University, London, (and quadrupling enterprise income) in Computing, Information Systems and Mathematics while teaching the mathematical modelling of business processes and knowledge management at MSc level. Mellor, influenced by Stiglitz, realized that econometric methods can be used to quantify the value of knowledge management. His breakthrough computer modelling resulted in a complete explanation of the developmental lifecycle of SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises), firstly in his 2011 book and then later expanded upon in his 2018 publication, \\"Big Data Modelling the Knowledge Economy\\". He runs a Masters programme around IT Consultancy, as well as a select \\"Big Data\\" research group engaged with modelling organizations, especially Science Parks, in the context of regional development. Most recently, working together with Matthias Georg Will, an econometric computer model was developed which explains why, in modern business environments, flat organizations can only exist if employees are able to competently evaluate incoming innovations and their judgement is accepted by their managers, a situation typified by the successful tech firms. Works Mellor is the author of over 100 scientific publications in journals, as well as eleven books, several of which have been translated into other languages. His impact factor (h-Index) is 25,https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user;=4q0Q7N8AAAAJ&view;_op=list_works&sortby;=pubdate putting him well into the top decile (10%) of researchers worldwide. He is an active consultant with over twelve years of industrial experience, and he lectures at postgraduate level on subjects like ‚Äòinformation systems and econometrics‚Äô, ‚Äòmathematical knowledge management‚Äô, ‚Äòstrategic innovation‚Äô, and ‚Äòtech entrepreneurship‚Äô. He has received many international prizes for his work and ideas, and in 2020, he became a member of the advisor pool to the UK Government Office for Science on post-COVID-19 needs.

The track hosts both Thoroughbred and Quarter Horse racing, notably the All American Futurity, the richest race in Quarter Horse racing.ruidownsracing.com It also hosts the Grade I All American Derby in early September, which carries a purse of $1,900,000 and was won in 2014 by the New Mexico-bred gelding Too Flash For You. History Pictured is the Ruidoso Downs New Mexico Racetrack and Casino, where the All American Futurity is held annually. After a flood covered fields in gravel and silt in the small village of Ruidoso Downs, an informal race track was built on the fields in the 1940s. Bets varied from as \\"little as a bag of oats or $10,000 to $50,000 was being bet.\\" A rodeo stand was moved from the village of Capitan, New Mexico to the field in 1945. Arizona investor Eugene Hensley bought the racetrack in 1953, becoming its general manager. Over the next decade the facility would undergo a number of expansions, and around 1957, the All American Futurity was created by Hensley, Carl Mercer, and cowboy musician Ray Reed. Held at the racetrack on Labor Day starting in 1959, they added The Rainbow Futurity in 1964. In 1988 the majority of Ruidoso Downs Race Track was purchased by R.D. Hubbard. Though the track had fallen into disrepair, within a year Hubbard and a business partner invested several million dollars into improving the track. 1989 also saw the addition of simulcast racing and wagering, while Hubbard bought out Allred in 1991. Soon a sales pavilion and sports theatre were constructed, which is where the Ruidoso Select Yearling Sale is held. The facilities have also housed camel and ostrich races, as well as concerts by artists such as Toby Keith and Emilio Navaira. An adjacent casino was opened by the Hubbards in 1999. The 1937 Kentucky Derby trophy won by War Admiral is typically kept on display at Ruidoso Downs.

It is developed by the Astronomical Applications Department, United States Naval Observatory. Currently, NOVAS has three different editions for C, Fortran, and Python, respectively. Algorithms The algorithms used by NOVAS are based on vector astrometry theories and the IAU resolutions. Instead of using trigonometric formulae from spherical astrometry, NOVAS uses the matrix and vector formulation which is more rigorous. This version implements the resolutions on astronomical reference systems and Earth rotation models passed at the IAU General Assemblies in 1997, 2000, and 2006. According to the Astronomical Applications Department, the algorithms used in NOVAS are identical to those used in the production of the US part of the Astronomical Almanac. A detailed description of the algorithms can be found here: Kaplan, et al. (1989) Astron. J. 97, 1197.  Structure  The NOVAS library provides three levels of subroutines (functions): basic, utility, and supervisory. Basic-level subroutines supply the values of fundamental variables, such as the nutation angles and the heliocentric positions of solar system bodies for specific epoches. Utility-level subroutines perform transformations, such as those caused by precession, nutation and aberration. Supervisory-level subroutines serve as interfaces to the basic and utility subroutines to compute the coordinates of stars or Solar System bodies for specific dates and times.  Usage  The NOVAS library can be linked by programs that work with positions of celestial bodies. For example, \\"Pocket Stars\\", an astronomy software for Smartphone and PDA platforms, used the NOVAS as its astrometry engine. The Python edition allows calling the NOVAS functions from Python. It is mostly feature complete with respect to the C edition, with a few exceptions, and shares the C edition's API. The current edition uses Python's foreign function library, ctypes. Current status Future versions of the Python interface will add support for passing data via NumPy types (and therefore support vectorized operations), and present a more Pythonic interface.

Jones, (20 March 1858 ‚Äì 24 May 1934) was a Welsh Liberal politician, businessman and soldier. Jones, who served as a Justice of the Peace in Carmarthenshire, married Margaret Francis of Llandeilo. In business, he was a director of the Ammanford Gas Company and the Duke Anthracite Collieries Ltd and the owner of Birchgrove Steelworks, Swansea.The Times, 13.6.29 He was appointed High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire for 1924. In 1889, Jones became an inaugural member of the Carmarthenshire County Council. He also served on Ammanford Urban District Council. Parliamentary candidate In 1926, Sir Alfred Mond the Liberal MP for Carmarthen defected to the Conservatives over the issue of land policy and the proposal by David Lloyd George that some agricultural land be nationalised. The policy had been set out in the publication Land and the Nation or the Green Book in October 1925 but it caused great debate in the Liberal Party and another MP, Hilton Young, who sat for Norwich also left the party for the Tories along with a couple of former MPs.Roy Douglas, Liberals: The History of the Liberal and Liberal Democrat Parties; Hambledon and London, 2005 p212 Mond decided not to resign and fight a by-election but there was an election to choose a successor to him to stand as a Liberal at the next election. This was initially contested by six candidates but four withdrew and the choice was between Jones and Richard Thomas Evans of Cardiff. Jones won in a close contest by 149 votes to 147, having made clear he was an opponent of the Green Book land policy whereas Evans, who had worked closely with Lloyd George on other Liberal policies, was in favour.The Times, 8.3.26 Evans however was later become MP for Carmarthen, sitting from 1931‚Äì35. At the time of the by- election, and in other sources referring to him in 1882, Jones was described variously as Lieutenant-Colonel or Colonel Jones but no indication of his army history is available in those sources. Carmarthen by-election, 1928 In the event Jones did not have to wait until the next general election as Mond accepted a peerage in 1928 and caused a by-election in Carmarthen. At the previous general election in 1924 the Conservatives had not fielded a candidate and Mond had won easily in a straight fight with Labour. However this time, they put up the barrister, Sir Courtenay Mansel, another escapee from the Liberal Party in 1926 who had been MP for Penryn and Falmouth from 1922‚Äì23 but who had local connections in Carmarthenshire and was also a Justice of the Peace there. The Labour candidate was the Welsh barrister (and future MP) Dan Hopkin. There was briefly the prospect of a four-cornered contest when the National Party of Wales announced their intention to stand a candidate but in the end they decided not to fight.The Times, 7.5.28 The by- election took place on 28 June 1928 and Jones emerged as the narrow winner. Jones had made his opposition to the land policy a feature of the campaign in an attempt to retain the support of the division's farmers, many of whom shared Mond's concern about the nationalisation proposals. In any event the Green Book had by this time been withdrawn as a full statement of Liberal land policy.The Times, 28.6.28 Instead, Jones promoted as the main object of Liberal land policy the desire to give security of tenure to tenant farmers. Many of those reliant on the land for their livelihood seemed to prefer the less radical solution of the government of Stanley Baldwin for the relief of rates on agricultural land.The Times, 27.6.28 Polling Polling day itself was affected by bad weather with heavy rain dampening the candidates‚Äô enthusiasm on the day and, it was reported, having a detrimental effect on turnout.The Times, 29.6.28 However the official figures showed a turnout of 76.6% an improvement over the previous general election when only 68% had turned out to vote.C Cook & J Ramsden, By-elections in British Politics; UCL Press, 1997 p275 In the end, Jones had majority of just 47 votes over his Labour opponent, polling 10,201 to Hopkins's 10,154 with Mansel for the Tories on 8,361. The drastic reduction in the size of the majority, even taking into account the fact that the Tories contested the seat, was a disappointment to the Liberals. Perhaps Liberal supporters felt they had been taken for granted by their party. Of their two previous MPs one had resigned to cause a by- election to find a seat for Sir Alfred Mond and then Mond himself had defected to the Tories without standing down to seek a mandate for his new party. Later elections The by-election did presage a change in political fortunes in the constituency. At the 1929 general election Jones lost the seat to Dan Hopkin in another three-cornered fight. Evans regained it for the Liberals in 1931 but lost to Hopkin in 1935. The seat returned to the Liberals in 1945 when it was won by Sir Rhys Hopkin Morris but was recaptured for Labour in 1957 at the by-election which was caused by Hopkin Morris‚Äô death; the successful Labour candidate being Lady Megan Lloyd George who had herself defected from Liberal to Labour. Death Jones died suddenly at Llanwrtyd Wells on 24 May 1934, aged 76.

It was powered by the same engine as the Type 95 ‚Äì a 450 hp (340 kW) Bristol Jupiter VI. Armament consisted of two synchronised .303 in (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns as well as a ring-mounted .303 in (7.7 mm) Lewis Gun at the rear. Operational history Cleaner and more compact than most aircraft in its class, the 101 displayed relatively high performance when first flown in 1927. However, it was rejected by the Air Ministry due to its wood construction, which was seen as out of date. No other buyers could be found and no more aircraft were produced. Continued as a private venture, it first flew at Filton on 8 August 1927, piloted by Cyril Uwins, registered G-EBOW. With the VIA powerplant, Uwins achieved second place in the 1928 King's Cup race at an average speed of 159.9 mph.

In May 1919, Italy issued special postage stamps for the part of Dalmatia it had occupied during World War I.Rossiter, Stuart & John Flower. The Stamp Atlas. London: Macdonald, 1986, p.94. The stamps were produced as surcharges of Italian stamps; the first appeared 1 May 1919, and consisted of the Italian 1-lira overprinted \\"una / corona\\". 5c and 10c overprints were issued in 1921, reading \\"5[10] / centesimi / di corona\\", followed by an additional five values in 1922. Similar overprints were made for special delivery and postage due stamps. Soon after the annexed territories switched to Italian currency and stamps. As a result, usage was uncommon and validly-used stamps are today worth about 50-100% more than unused. They are easily confused with the Italian issues used in occupied Austria; the Dalmatian overprints are distinguished by their use of a sans serif typeface.

History Harish, 2011 Harish, 2016 Harish was founded as a Nahal settlement in 1982 and converted into a kibbutz in 1985. The kibbutz disbanded in 1993. Following a government decision, a new neighborhood of 300 housing units was built on the site and marketed to career army officers, although few moved there. Harish merged with the neighboring town of Katzir, forming Katzir-Harish. They separated again in 2012, with Harish remaining a town, and Katzir reverting to the jurisdiction of Menashe Regional Council. In the 1990s, the low cost of housing attracted young couples, mostly secular, but in 2003, a group of Garin Torani families moved to the town. In addition, an Arab Bedouin clan from Ramla moved there in order to end a bloody feud with another clan. In 2007, Israeli Housing Minister Ariel Atias came up with a plan to develop Harish into a city with a population of 100,000. Fearing it would become a Haredi stronghold, the secular residents led by Hemi Bar-Or petitioned the Israeli Supreme Court. Housing tenders were opened to the general public, attracting Israelis looking for affordable housing and bicycle enthusiasts who eyed the nearby forests as a weekend cycling destination. In 2012, a secular buyers' group bid on lots zoned for 400 housing units. A master plan for Harish designed by Mansfeld- Kehat Architects calls for the expansion of Harish to Highway 65 in the north, and Baqa al-Gharbiyye in the south. Construction of new neighborhoods began in 2013.https://www.harish.co.il/about-harish By August 2015, construction was well underway, with many buildings nearing completion. In January 2016, the Israeli cabinet approved a 1 billion NIS plan to turn Harish into a city of 50,000 in three years, with the eventual goal of 100,000. Harish will be expanded to the northeast, with residential areas, a business zone, a hotel, 600 dunams of public parks and gardens, and a special site consolidating all emergency services.http://jpupdates.com/2015/12/20/israels-cabinet-approves- one-billion-shekalim-for-new-city-of-harish/ Harish is being built as a smart city, with full WiFi coverage and its own fiber optic cables, LED streetlights with sensors, camera-equipped lampposts, and smart trash cans that will signal trucks through the Internet when they need to be emptied. A 60 meter wide main boulevard will be built with an island in the middle lined with bicycle paths, benches, and small cafes. It has also been suggested that a light rail line may be built in the future.

It provided a new approach to workforce and economic development. Through the WIRED model, regions integrated economic and workforce development activities to demonstrate that talent development can drive economic transformation in regional economies across the United States.  History = Birth of the Public Workforce System  The WIRED Initiative was conceived from lessons learned since the birth of the public workforce system in the 1930s. The workforce system was designed for the economy of the day - an economy characterized by interchangeable labor, cyclical layoffs and a workforce that required no more than a high school diploma. These New Deal policies firmly established the federal government's commitment to minimizing hardships associated with unemployment and facilitating a worker's return to work. In the 1960s, a job training system was created to serve American workers. Like other programs of the day, the system was designed on a social services model. Policies like the Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA) of 1962 and the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) of 1973 had little private sector involvement and governed a system that saw over 40 percent of its participants engaged in subsidized employment. In 1982, the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) was enacted, replacing CETA. JTPA eliminated the Public Service Employment Program (part of CETA) and increased funding for job training.  WIA  The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) reformed the structure established by the JTPA. The act, which was approved with strong bipartisan support, streamlined service delivery through One-Stop Career Centers, strengthened performance accountability, promoted universal access to services, created business-led state and local boards and promoted individual choice.  High Growth Job Training Initiative  To address the growing need for skilled workers, DOL identified industries of our economy that could significantly benefit from talent development; industries that are experiencing rapid growth or a significant transformation in the skills required of its employees. Launched in 2003, the President's High Growth Job Training Initiative engages these identified industries in the talent development, connects businesses to the workforce system and creates programs designed to meet their specific workforce needs. The initiative takes a groundbreaking approach to closing skills gaps by developing solutions to workforce challenges and creating partnerships among business, education institutions and the workforce community.  Community-Based Job Training Grants  The President's Community-Based Job Training Grants address the need for a partnership between the workforce system and the vocational education system, increase the capacity of community colleges to meet the demands of today's employers and recognize community colleges as an easily adaptable and viable means for talent development. The grants provide schools the resources to hire faculty, and purchase equipment and facilities they needed to train and educate workers for jobs in the high-growth fields. These grants were first made available in 2005, and are designed to bridge community colleges with business and industry to better address talent development. Additionally, Community-Based Job Training Grants also help strengthen the relationship between the job training system and the community college system. The jobs of today and tomorrow require individuals with postsecondary education and community colleges are the most flexible, affordable and accessible option for many Americans. As more competition enters the global market, workers from around the globe are competing with Americans for jobs and winning. The Community Based Job Training Grants empower community colleges to provide greater opportunities for Americans and keeps our nation competitive in the global economy.  Regional Economies  Globalization has changed the formula for developing a prepared workforce and necessitated a change in visualizing the boundaries of an economy. An economy is no longer defined by the political boundaries of a city, county or state line. Instead, economies are defined regionally by a diverse group of industries, supported by factors such as infrastructure, investment and an availability of local talent. This regional concept promotes partnerships among key community players, including K-12 schools, community colleges, adult education centers, universities, regional employers and community economic and workforce development organizations. This is supported by academic developments, as scholars like Porter (2000) argue for the continuing importance of industry clusters for economic development at both the macro and micro level.Michael Porter, ‚ÄúLocation, Competition, and Economic Development: Local Clusters in a Global Economy,‚Äù Economic Development Quarterly, Vol. 14, No. 1, February 2000, pp. 15-34.  The Birth of WIRED  On February 1, 2006, U.S. Department of Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao announced the WIRED Initiative, encompassing these ideals to better align workforce and economic development. WIRED takes a critical step in providing individuals with the tools for success, businesses the human capital required for growth, and the American economy the fuel for continued strength.The Road to WIRED January 23, 2007  Activities  In February 2006, following a Solicitation for Grant Applications, the Employment & Training Administration (ETA) announced 13 regions that comprise the WIRED 1st Generation. These regions were selected on the basis of a number of criteria, including (1) the viability of regionally competitive clusters; (2) a framework for public- private administration of the program; (3) evidence of economic distress in the region; and (4) a detailed plan for systematic interconnections between public workforce administration agencies, educational institutions, nonprofits, and private industry.Henry Renski, ‚ÄúA New Era of Federal Involvement in Regional Economic Development? The Case of the WIRED Initiative,‚Äù Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy, volume 27, March 2009, pp, 593- 611 First Generation regions face various challenges in economic development and sustainability including: remaining competitive with a globalized workforce; managing existing growth opportunities; and creating a more innovative economy by focusing on developing small business. First Generation WIRED Regions were awarded $15 million over three years to revitalize their local economy. In April, 2006, ETA added 13 additional regions, then known as the Virtual Regions. These regions received a $100,000 planning grant, were invited to participate in all WIRED-related activities and were given access to the tools and resources developed. In January 2007, these regions became the 2nd Generation Regions and received an immediate investment of $500,000. This investment supports the development of a comprehensive implementation plan. Upon completion and acceptance of this plan, each region will receive an additional $4.5 million investment over a three-year period. On June 20, 2007, ETA announced the expansion of the WIRED Initiative. Thirteen applications were selected to become the Third Generation of WIRED Regions. Each will receive a $5 million investment over a three-year period. All 39 WIRED Regions were supported by managers from ETA and the WIRED resource team, as well as access to various staff from other federal agencies. This expanded team provided the regions with tools and technical assistance that assisted them with implementing their plan for regional economic growth. In addition to the monetary investments, a number of activities took place in support of the WIRED regions including: * Creation of a data tool that incorporates economic, research and development, investment and real-time job information to provide a current and accurate picture of the regional economy and its assets. * Development of a nationwide network of foundations interested in investing in regional economic and talent development. * Linkages to angel and venture capital networks. * Connections to programs and investments at nine other federal agencies for regions to access and apply in support of their economic strategy. * Partnerships with state universities and land grant colleges as well as university continuing education departments.About WIRED November 06, 2006.  Critical reception  Recent academic literature seems to reinforce WIRED's rationale. Indeed, there are two economic development forces‚Äîwhich often theoretically overlap‚Äîat work here: one at the micro level (the specific programs of the grantee regions) and one at the macro level (the federal government). At the grantee level, as Renski (2009) notes, ‚Äúthere are really no new ideas in WIRED. Clusters, partnerships, regional competitiveness, asset mapping‚Äîthe buzzwords of WIRED‚Äîhave been a part of the vernacular of the economic development profession for quite some time.\\" In this respect, the WIRED initiative as a whole incorporates a number of well-accepted economic development practices, while leaving specific application to each grantee region. Blakeley and Leigh (2010), Porter (2000), and Renski note that cities and regions have long practiced economic development techniques like fostering cluster development to stimulate innovation and technology spillover to remain competitive in a global market.Edward Blakely and Nancy Green Leigh, Planning Local Economic Development: Theory and Practice, 4th ed., (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 2010). Yet, at the macro level, subsidizing this approach regionally is new. Renski points out that ‚Äúthe novel aspect of WIRED is simply that it is administered and funded by the U.S. federal government, who has had little involvement in regional economic development since the 1970s.‚Äù Markusen and Glassmeier (2008) note that ‚ÄúIn general, federal economic development programs place too much emphasis on physical infrastructure and not enough on human capital and ‚Äòsoft‚Äô infrastructure, meaning organizational know-how and networking.‚ÄùAnn Markusen and Amy Glasmeier, ‚ÄúOverhauling and Revitalizing Federal Economic Development Programs,‚Äù Economic Development Quarterly, (2008) Vol. 22, No. 2: 83. Thus, it is the focus on regional growth that crosses traditional political and jurisdictional boundaries which makes WIRED a notable program in the conversation on effective economic development policy.

He was prominent in the efforts to suppress Confederate sympathizers within the city early in the war, and helped organize civilians to assist in constructing earthworks to defend the city during the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign. Biography Henry was born and raised in Philadelphia, and was educated in local schools. He was a son of John Snowden Henry and Elizabeth (Bayard) Henry, and a grandson of Philadelphia businessman Alexander Henry. He graduated with high honors from Princeton University in 1840. He studied law, passed his bar exam in 1844, and established a prosperous legal firm. He became active in local politics and represented the Seventh Ward on the City Council from 1856-57.Campbell, p. 428. In 1858, running as a member of the People's Party, he was elected mayor, defeating incumbent Richard Vaux. Henry took office on May 11. Among his platforms was strong support for the city's proposed system of public transportation, including streetcars. He also dramatically strengthened the police force. Once the Civil War began in 1861, Philadelphia's southern leanings changed, and hostility moved from abolitionists to Southern sympathizers. Mobs threatened a secessionist newspaper and the homes of suspected sympathizers. Henry responded to the growing crisis, and led efforts, along with the city police, to turn away the rioters and quell the unrest.Weigley, p. 394. Henry aligned himself with the Republican Party and was reelected to successive terms. During the Gettysburg Campaign in June 1863, he called out the home guard under Brig. General A. J. Pleasonton to help defend the city and encouraged citizens to help strengthen the line of earthworks and small forts ringing the main approaches to Philadelphia.Defending Philadelphia from Lee's Invading Army . Henry, along with Maj. Gen. Napoleon J. T. Dana, organized a work party of 700 men for this effort.Seitter article. In late 1865, Henry chose not to run for another term and left office on January 1, 1866. He became a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania, and was a bank director for several years. He also was a leading member of the board of directors that planned the 1876 Centennial Exposition. He retired to a stately home in the Germantown region. Henry died in Philadelphia at age 60 from pneumonia after returning from a prolonged visit to Europe after the death of his only child, his son. He was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia's East Falls section. Honors Henry Avenue in the Roxborough neighborhood was named for the former mayor.History of Andorra .

It is the type species of the genus Disa, and one of its best-known members. It is occasionally referred to by its old name Disa grandiflora.  Distribution  Its range is restricted to the Sandstone Mountains of the South Western Cape, South Africa, west of Hermanus to Table Mountain and northwards into the Cederberg Mountains. It is common on Table Mountain, and the Back Table, but is rarely seen further south on the Cape Peninsula. The orchid grows near waterfalls, streamlets, and seeps in the mountains. It is, however, never found along the shores of dams whose water levels vary considerably during the year.  Description  It is a fairly stout perennial 15 ‚Äì 60 cm in height, spreading by stolons. The leaves are lance shaped, the lower ones spreading or semi-erect up to 25 cm long. The inflorescence is 1-3 flowered. The blooms are showy, and can be 10 cm across the laterally spreading sepals, which are scarlet to carmine in color. The middle, upright sepal is pinkish on the inside with scarlet veins. The petals, which are very much smaller than the sepals, are erect colored yellow with red spots at their tops, but pale scarlet at their bases. It blooms during the summer months, particularly in January, but continuing into March. Its pollination is one of the most complex of all the orchids, involving the mountain pride butterfly, Aeropetes tulbaghia.  As an emblem  The Mountain Club of South Africa, the Western Province Rugby Team and the Western Cape Gymnastics Association use the image of this species on their badges and logos. It has been the Mountain Club's logo since its founding in 1891. The flowers are also depicted on the obverse side of the Pro Merito Medal (1975).

It is native to the southern Afrotropics, where it occurs in well-watered miombo woodlands. Within range it is one of the most popular wild fruits. It is rarely cultivated but trees are left when land is being cleared. Still a traditional food plant in Africa, this little-known fruit has the potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable land care. In Shona, the fruit are referred to as mazhanje, and in Chichewa masuku. Range It occurs in the miombo woodlands of Angola, the DRCongo, Zambia, southern Burundi, Tanzania, Malawi, central and northern Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. Growth It is a dioecious species ‚Äì the clusters of staminate (or male) and single pistillate (or female) flowers are borne on separate trees. It grows to a height of 5‚Äì13 meters, and 15‚Äì25 cm in trunk diameter. The dark green, glossy leaves are 12‚Äì36 cm long and 8‚Äì24 cm wide. It is not prone to attack by pests. It grows in areas with over 600mm/year of rain, and prefers well drained sand or gravelly soils low in organic matter; its presence is indicative of poor agricultural soils. Fruit Female trees fruit after about 9‚Äì10 years from seed. The fruit is roughly spherical drupe about 2‚Äì4 cm in diameter, green in colour ripening to yellow or brown. When ripe, the 1.5mm hard shell encloses the yellow flesh which has an appealing sweet taste that has been likened to pear or plum. Fruits usually contain 3 or 4 seeds, though sometimes 5. Fruits weigh between 5 and 50 grams each, with from 0.2-30 grams of pulp. The fruit is usually eaten by wild animals such as monkeys. Propagation It is usually propagated by seed, which is recalcitrant and germinates readily, reaching 90% after 6 weeks for fresh seed. The tree can also be propagated vegetatively - a success rate of 80% has been achieved with wedge or splice grafts. Air layering is also possible, though these trees have not fared well without a taproot. The tree naturally propagates via underground suckers and forms stands.http://www.africoresources.com/r/files/kalukundi_flora_eap.pdf Cultivars Little work has been done developing cultivars, though some named varieties do exist. Since 1996, work on propagating of superior seedlings has been carried out in Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe by the Southern Africa Regional Programme.

Unlike most members of the family, it produces globular fruits.Adenkunle, Afolayan, Okoh, Omotosho, Pendota, & Sowemimo 2011 Its common names include ditax, ditakh, detar, and tallow tree. The tree is of value for several reasons: the fruit is nutritious,National Research Council 2008 is locally prominent in folk medicineAkah, Nworu, Mbaoji, Nwabunike, & Onyeto 2012 is a source of quality timber.El-Kamali 2011 It could contribute to food security, sustainable land care, and rural development. As its Linnaean name indicates, it is native to Senegal and the surrounding countries of West Africa.  Description  Detarium senegalese is a medium-sized tree that may grow up to 40 m tall.Adenkunle, Afolayan, Okoh, Omotosho, Pendota, & Sowemimo 2011 Like many trees in the Detarioideae, they have thick, irregularly placed branches. The trunks of mature trees typically range from 60‚Äì100 cm in diameter.El-Kamali 2011 The fruit is a globular, dark green drupe with fibrous pulp and a single seed.Cisse, Dieme, Diop, Dornier, Ndiaye, & Sock 2010 They are similar to the fruits of the tamarind, which belongs to Tamarindus, another genus in the subfamily Detarioideae.National Research Council 2008 The sweet and sour flavour of the fruit is popular and the shelf life is good because of the hard shell and dry pulp.National Research Council 2008 To establish the tree more widely as an agricultural line, some genetic work is required; for example some of the trees produce toxic fruits and there is currently no method of differentiating them from trees that grow desirable fruit.Cisse, Dieme, Diop, Dornier, Ndiaye, & Sock 2010  Location and growing conditions  Trees of the genus Detarium have not as yet been subjected to systematic culture or genetic improvement, and currently they remain confined to their countries of origin in West Africa.El-Kamali 2011 The fruits produced by the Detarium senegalense tree were described as ‚Äúdetar‚Äù in 1789, by De Jussieu in Senegal, Africa. Being discovered in Senegal, these trees still remain an important contributor to the country‚Äôs local food system and economy.Cisse, Dieme, Diop, Dornier, Ndiaye, & Sock 2010 Detarium senegalense trees are typically found growing in gallery forests, savannas,Cisse, Dieme, Diop, Dornier, Ndiaye, & Sock 2010 or along river banks.Akah, Nworu, Mbaoji, Nwabunike, & Onyeto 2012 Detarium senegalense trees are propagated by stones which are often distributed by animals who consume the fruits. Germination occurs 6‚Äì10 weeks after propagation, though the germination rate is typically low.El-Kamali 2011 Although tallow trees are leguminous, they do not fix significant amounts of nitrogen.National Research Council 2008 The Detarium senegalense tree has two phases of fructification.Cisse, Dieme, Diop, Dornier, Ndiaye, & Sock 2010 Trees generally lose their leaves at the beginning of March and experience a renewal of leaves a few weeks later. After young leaves have developed, flowering occurs. As the fruits ripen, they develop a sweeter flavour and increased vitamin C content. Fruits reach full maturation from August‚ÄìNovember depending on the climate of the region they are growing in.Cisse, Dieme, Diop, Dornier, Ndiaye, & Sock 2010 Trees are drought tolerant and have the ability to grow on infertile sites as they are relatively insensitive to soil, altitude, heat, and humidity.National Research Council 2008 Their wood has good resistance to termites, pinhole borers, and marine bores; however, the wood is susceptible to Lyctus attack.El-Kamali 2011  Consumption and uses  Several parts of the Detarium senegalense tree are utilized for a variety of purposes, but mainly for folk medicine. The bark of the tree is most widely used in preparations for: the expulsion of the placenta after birth and treatment of anaemia;Adenkunle, Afolayan, Okoh, Omotosho, Pendota, & Sowemimo 2011 wounds, skin problems, bronchitis, pneumonia, stomach ache and digestive disorders;Akah, Nworu, Mbaoji, Nwabunike, & Onyeto 2012 tuberculosis;El-Kamali 2011 and cases of heavy blood loss. Root decoctions are used to treat marasmus, debility, intestinal complaints,El-Kamali 2011 and convulsions.Akah, Nworu, Mbaoji, Nwabunike, & Onyeto 2012 Leaf and shoot mixtures have been used in the treatment of dysentery, conjunctivitis,Akah, Nworu, Mbaoji, Nwabunike, & Onyeto 2012 arthritis, fractures, and boils.El-Kamali 2011 Seeds have been applied to control blood-glucose levels in diabetic individuals, for the treatment of mosquito bitesCisse, Dieme, Diop, Dornier, Ndiaye, & Sock 2010 and as an antidote against arrow poison and snake bite.Akah, Nworu, Mbaoji, Nwabunike, & Onyeto 2012 Nutritionally, ‚Äúofo‚Äù flour made from the seeds is often used as a soup thickener.Adenkunle, Afolayan, Okoh, Omotosho, Pendota, & Sowemimo 2011 The pulp of the fruit is eaten directly, but also is made into sherbets, juices, marmalades,Cisse, Dieme, Diop, Dornier, Ndiaye, & Sock 2010 or dried like dates.National Research Council 2008 The timber from the trees is referred to as ‚ÄúAfrican mahogany‚Äù and is characterized by its dark reddish- brown shade. Though the wood is heavy, it is easy to work with and resists moisture, weathering, and pests such as termites and borers.National Research Council 2008 It is valued for the construction of houses, fences, and boats, but also as firewood as it burns easily and cleanly.El-Kamali 2011 Detarium senegalense trees are frequently employed in reforestation programs in areas of degraded land as they grow well even on poor soils.El-Kamali 2011 Though there is little information on the nutrient composition of the Detarium senegalense fruit, it appears to be nourishing. Per 100 g, sweet detar fruit contains 116 kcal energy, 1.9 g protein, 0.4 g fat, 29.6 g carbohydrates, 2.3 g fibre, 27 mg calcium, 48 mg phosphate, 0.14 mg thiamin and 0.05 mg riboflavin,El-Kamali 2011 2.8 mg iron, 0.6 mg niacin, and, most notably, about 1200 mg vitamin C.Cisse, Dieme, Diop, Dornier, Ndiaye, & Sock 2010 In comparison to recommended daily vitamin and mineral requirements for an adult (in Canada), the fresh fruit contains moderate amounts of thiamin and iron, an exceptional amount of vitamin C, and lesser quantities of the other vitamins and minerals.Brown, Isaacs, Krinke, Lechtenberg, Murtaugh, Sharbaugh, Splett, Stang, & Wooldrige 2011 The fruit seeds yield about 12% protein, and are rich in essential amino acids lysine and tryptophan. The ‚Äúofo‚Äù flour made from the seeds accordingly is very nutritious.National Research Council 2008 Leaves from the trees have demonstrated antiviral activity against a number of human and animal viruses and the bark has shown antibacterial activity against many pathogenic bacteria, justifying the medicinal properties of the plant.El- Kamali 2011  Practical information  Fruits such as sweet detar can contribute to successful interventions to improve local livelihoods as they are rich in nutrients, require minimal preparation, and have flavours that appeal to many tastes.National Research Council 2008 Storing sweet detar at temperatures around 4 degrees Celsius will preserve its quality by limiting the loss of vitamin C. As the fruit goes bad, the coating will change to a brown-yellow colour. A sieve is useful for separating debris and the seed from the pulp of the fruit and a mortar and pestle work well for pureeing the pulp.Cisse, Dieme, Diop, Dornier, Ndiaye, & Sock 2010 Though some Detarium senegalense trees produce toxic fruits, these are often identifiable by the presence of fruits remaining under the trees. If left behind, the trees are likely toxic as animals are normally very quick to take the fruits.El-Kamali 2011 Propagation time can be decreased by grafting. For the Detarium senegalense tree, the apical graft is the most effective when employed at the end of the dry season. Gaye & Solviev 2004 It is also important to work toward increasing the local dependency and appreciation of wild fruits when creating interventions as there are some traditional negative stigmas and beliefs concerning the consumption of wild fruits. Conflicts around ownership may arise if trees remain undomesticated. A potential solution is the adoption of salvation forestry, where local people produce local products in a manner that guarantees them a share in the yields.National Research Council 2008  Notes  References  * Adenkunle, A., Afolayan, A., Okoh, B., Omotosho, T., Pendota, C., & Sowemimo, A.

Near the Hudson Valley, the term Hudson Highlands is often used. The portion of the prong that enters Connecticut is known as the Housatonic Highlands. Relation to other divisions of the New England Uplands There are two subsections of the New England Uplands in addition to the Reading Prong. A prong of the same rock belt extends from the Hudson Highlands south to New York City along the Hudson River. This region is often referred to as the Manhattan Prong. The Staten Island Serpentinite is also a southward extension of the New England Uplands.Geomorphic Provinces and Sections of the New York Bight Watershed Geology The Reading Prong is part of the Precambrian basement which is discontinuously exposed in the north-central Appalachians. The rocks that make up the prong consist of diverse gneisses.Metamorphic History of the Northeastern Reading Prong The New England Province and the Blue Ridge province share many geological similarities, and some experts consider the Reading Prong merely a continuation of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which reach their northern terminus at South Mountain near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. In the gap between the Blue Ridge and the Reading Province, the two mountainous regions descend into the Appalachian Piedmont. Together, the Blue Ridge province and the New England province are often referred to as the Crystalline Appalachians.

Hong was born in Chasong, North Pyongan.  Biography  Hong was originally a hunter who lived in Korea during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). In September 1907, Japan, as part of its colonial policies in Korea passed a law that required hunters to turn in their hunting guns. The intent was to weaken the Korean resistance. The law effectively ruined the ability of hunters to pursue their traditional livelihood, which resulted in further anger and resentment. Among the angered hunters was Hong. In response to the outlawing of hunters' guns, Hong organized a resistance force named the 1907 Righteous Army of Jeongmi. The Righteous Army carried out a number of battles against Japanese garrisons around the Bukcheong area, using hit-and-run attacks. In 1910, Hong moved to Gando, China. After the March First Movement in Korea, Hong became a Commander-in-Chief in the . In August 1919, Hong crossed the Tumen River with 200 soldiers. Once across the river and in Korea, Hong successfully attacked the Japanese troops in Hyesanjin and Kapsan. Hong and his soldiers would cross the Tumen River twice more, each time carrying out successful attacks against the occupying Japanese forces. In June 1920, Hong and his army fought against the Imperial Japanese forces, killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers in the battles of () and Bongodong (). In October of the same year, working together with Kim Jwa-jin, Hong again carried out an attack against Japanese troops at what is known as the Battle of Cheongsanri (). The following year (1921) Hong and his forces were in the Soviet Union, seeking refuge from the Japanese forces who hunted him. In June, the Soviet military enacted a policy by Joseph Stalin to secure Russian borders near China and Korea. Concerned that the Japanese Army might enter the Soviet Union in pursuit of Hong and other Korean independence fighters, the Soviet Union disarmed Korean troops. The loss of weapons and safe areas for Hong and his forces resulted in the collapse of the Korean Independence Army. Hong, still hoping to oppose the Japanese in Korea, chose to join the Russian red army. In 1937, Stalin's deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union took place. Originally conceived in 1926, initiated in 1930, and carried through in 1937, this was the first mass transfer of an entire nationality in the Soviet Union. Almost the entire Soviet population of ethnic Koreans (171,781 persons) were forcefully moved from the Russian Far East to unpopulated areas of the Kazakh SSR and the Uzbek SSR in October 1937. Hong was among those Koreans forcibly relocated to Kazakhstan. It is estimated that 40,000 deported Koreans died in 1937 and 1938 from starvation, exposure and difficulties adapting to their new environment. Hong died in Kazakhstan in 1943. On October 25, 1963, Hong was posthumously awarded the Republic of Korea Medal of Merit for National Foundation.  Korean independence army  In 1919, Hong Beom-do (1868 ~ 1943) created relations with Koreans residing in Yeonggae, Primorsky, and Gando (Inter-Intership). In March 1920, he joined forces with the Korean National Association Army, led by An Mu, and they became an autonomous organization of Korean resistance fighters opposed to Japanese colonialism. During this time they lived and operated in the area of Nosuando. Starting with the attack on Hyesanjin (a city located on the Yalu River) in August 1919, the military forces led by Hong launched a military campaign against the Japanese forces in northern Korea. After March 1920, Hong led the coalition of the Korean independence forces in the northern area of Manchuria. Hong Beom-do, who had also led the Korean Righteous Army, has won several victories since 1907 at Gaksan, Samsu, and Bukcheong. These successes eventually led to increased attacks by the Japanese Army and the Korean army's activities in Korea became difficult, resulting in a need to escape in 1910 to Primorsky and Kando. Once in a safer location inside Russia, Hong continued his campaign against the Japanese. In August 1918, when Japan invaded Primorsky in support of the White Army during the Russian civil war, Hong Beom-do formed a military force centered around the former independence army and Korean people living in Manchuria. When the March 1st Movement took place in 1919, Hong and his soldiers moved to Antuhyun. Later, in August 1919, the Korean independence army crossed the Yalu River and wiped out a Japanese military unit. This was the first domestic military operation to take place in Korea following the March 1st Movement. In October, Hong's forces once again moved into Korea, occupied Ganggye and Manpojin, fighting a fierce battle with the Japanese army in Jaseong county, northern Korea. By March 1920, Hong was allied with the Dongdo-dong Military Service, led by Choi Jin-dong, who had been stationed in Hoeryong and Jongseong (Wongseong) along the Tuman coast of the Tuman River. The domestic resistance operation of the Korean Liberation Army provided a boost to the national spirit of Koreans everywhere and prompted further armed resistance struggles in Manchuria. By March 1920, the Korean independence army had moved its base from Antuhyun to Wang Qinghyun, China and received financial support from the Korean People's Association for a larger domestic resistance operation. Hong also joined forces with the National Liberation Army, which was under the leadership of the Korean People's Association. The military's finances and administration were managed by the Korean Minjok Association and the Korean Liberation Army was directed by Hong Beom-do. On May 3, 1920, the Korea Military Association held a joint military operation with other Korean military and resistance forces in Wangchunhyeon Poomdong. Also located there were the Provisional Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the Korean Civil Corps. The northern Korean military group orchestrated many of the subsequent activities, specifically being in charge of administration, politics, and finances. Hong Beom-do became the head of the Korean Northern Army Command and was in charge of the military forces. The Korean rebels were assembled into four groups under the leadership of Yi Cheon-oh, Kang Sang-mo, Kang Si-beom, and Jo Kwon- dong. On June 4, 1920, the Independence Army of Korea, which was led by Park Seung-gil, entered Jaseong County, Korea and ambushed Samdungja and attacked a Japanese army patrol. In retaliation, the Japanese army occupied Nanam-dong (now Cheongjin) in North Hamgyeong-do of the Japanese 19th Division headquarter base. By June 7, the Doron Ministry of Military and the Shinmin Army of the Korean People's Association had defeated a battalion of the 19th Division of the Japanese Army and won a great victory for the Korean people. On July 8, Hong and his forces surprised and defeated the Japanese police who were searching for the independence forces in that area. The Japanese Army, having lost the battle in Chungsang-ri and other locations, retaliated by carrying out a campaign of brutal scorched earth warfare that included the killing of Koreans and burning of villages. In response, the Korean Independence Army launched a military counter offensive. In December 1920, Hong's forces were integrated with other independence forces to organize the Korean Liberation Army. Battle of Bongo-dong (Battle of Fengwudong) After the March First Movement (), there are Korean Independence Army of armed resistances in Manchuria. The Japanese army conducted a series of suppression operations starting in May, 1920. In August 1919, Hong Beom-do launched an advance operation into Korea. Hong succeeded in integrating the northern army in Gando with other forces. On May 28, 1920, Hong Beom-do's Korean Independence Army(), Ahn-Mu's National Army() and Choi Jin-dong's Military Affairs Command() were combined into the Korean Northern Army Command(). They assembled troops and were prepared for a significant military operation. On June 4, 1920, troops of Korean Democratic Corps() attacked Japanese Army units in Hamgyeongbuk-do Gangyang-dong(). The next day, a Japanese unit pursued the Independence Army, and the Korean Northern Army Command trapped the Japanese in Samdunja(), soundly defeating them. On June 6 and 7, as the conflict increased, the Japanese Army deployed a battalion from the 19th Division, stationing it at Nanam(). The Japanese battalion launched an attack on Bongo- dong(). The Independence Army combined forces were led by Hong Beom-do and hid in ambush in the mountains of Bongo-dong. As the Japanese forces advanced, the Korean military and ambushed the pursuing battalion from three sides, destroying them. The Japanese battalion withdrew after suffering substantial casualties. An estimated 157 Japanese soldiers were killed and 300 wounded out of 500, and 13-21 Koreans were killed and 18 wounded out of 1,200~1,300. Influence The Battle of Bongo-dong was the first large-scale battle between the Korean Independence Army and the Japanese Army in Manchuria. The Korean soldiers and the leadership of the Korean Northern Army Command were inspired by the victory, as were Koreans in China and Korea. The Korean resistance forces served as momentum for further independence battles in the 1920s.

Military of the Roman Republic and Empire wore loosely regulated dress and armour. The contemporary concept of uniforms was not part of Roman culture and there were considerable differences in detail. Armour was not standardized and even that produced in state factories varied according to the province of origin. Likewise the Romans had no concept of obsolescence. Provided it remained serviceable, soldiers were free to use armour handed down by family members, buy armour from soldiers who had completed their service or wear discontinued styles of armour if they preferred it to (or could not afford) the latest issue. Thus it was common for legions to wear a mix of various styles that could cover a considerable time period. Fragments of surviving clothing and wall paintings indicate that the basic tunic of the Roman soldier was of red or undyed (off-white) wool. Senior commanders are known to have worn white cloaks and plumes. The centurions who made up the long serving backbone of the legions were distinguished by transverse crests on their helmets, chest ornaments corresponding to modern medals and the long cudgels that they carried. Examples of items of Roman military personal armour included: * The Galea or soldier's helmet. Variant forms included the Coolus helmet, Montefortino helmet, and Imperial helmet. * Greaves, to protect the legs. * Lorica (armour), including: ** Lorica hamata (mail armour) ** Lorica manica (arm guards) ** Lorica plumata (a form of scale armour resembling feathers) ** Lorica segmentata (segmented armour) ** Lorica squamata (scale armour) ** Lorica musculata (muscle armour) Other garments and equipment included: * A tunic * The baldric, a belt worn over one shoulder that is typically used to carry a weapon (usually a sword) or other implement such as a bugle or drum * The balteus, the standard belt worn by the Roman legionary. It was probably used to tuck clothing into or to hold weapons. * Braccae (trousers), popular among Roman legionaries stationed in cooler climates to the north of southern Italy * Caligae, heavy-soled military shoes or sandals which were worn by Roman legionary soldiers and auxiliaries throughout the history of the Roman Republic and Empire. * The focale, a scarf worn by the Roman legionary to protect the neck from chafing caused by constant contact with the soldier's armor * The loculus, a satchel, carried by legionaries as a part of their sarcina (marching pack) * The paludamentum, a cloak or cape fastened at one shoulder, worn by military commanders and (less often) by their troops  See also  * Roman military personal equipment Ordinary soldiers wore a sagum instead of a paludamentum References External links  * Beginners' Guide to Roman Military Equipment at museums.ncl.ac.uk * Graham Sumner's website * ","title":"Ancient Roman military clothing"},{"id":"18677917","text":"Regavim () is a kibbutz in northern Israel.

Weber succeeded in counterfeiting the Canadian hundred-dollar bill. They were the highest quality computer produced counterfeits of Canadian currency to date. Between ten and nineteen percent of retailers nationwide refused accepting 100 dollar bills as payment, due to the difficulty of identifying the fake copies. In 2006 the Canadian History channel made a documentary about him.  Early life Weber grew up in Amherstburg, a small town near Windsor, Ontario. During his high school years he considered himself a computer nerd and by the age of 13 he was able to produce his first fake bills. After high school, Weber started to study bioscience and took two years of mechanical engineering at the University of Windsor. Before finishing his degree he moved to Toronto and by the age of 26 he purchased a condominium, a Ferrari and various other luxury vehicles. Counterfeiting During his teenage years Wesley Weber was able to forge all kind of documents, including insurance certificates, welfare cards, checks and gift certificates. In 1997 he was sentenced to three months for forgery. After that, he spent weeks tinkering with scanned copies of banknotes to perfect the simulated images and security features using techniques he found on websites. He used editing software that allowed to enlarge the image up to 1000 times and printed more than 7.7 million dollars using an HP Deskjet printer. To emulate the security features of the real money, Weber used special paper that did not glow under UV light as well as custom foil to forge the metallic patch on the bills. He also purchased fluorescent paint to simulate another feature, the polymer UV responsive dots. He was arrested in October 2000 after a police raid into the building used to print the money, where they seized over a quarter million dollars in counterfeit bills. By November 2001, over 40 000 fake bills had been detected and taken out of circulation. Police started following Weber's trail after he used his 100 dollar counterfeit bills to pay for a three-thousand dollar purchase at an auto parts supplier. The year he was arrested, Canada changed their currency bills, introducing new security features to try to prevent counterfeiting. Weber pleaded guilty in August 2001, and received a five-year prison sentence. Weber was released from jail in August 2006 and moved to Richmond Hill, Ontario where he worked selling phones. Trading During his jail term Weber learned market trading and after release founded the consulting firm Goldbridge Financial Inc. which provided financial services without registration. Weber and his wife, Michelle Kam, co-founded the digital currency startup company Incryptex which provides a platform for trading and storing digital crypto-currencies. Weber used the alias 'Wesley Kam' to try to get the company listed on a public exchange by issuing shares and received funds from investors. In January 2019, Weber pleaded guilty to violating a 2011 trading ban from the Ontario Securities Commission for his activities in Incryptex. On 29 October 2019, he was sentenced for that offence to a prison term of 90 days, along with two years of probation by Justice Malcolm McLeod of the Ontario Court of Justice.  Cannabis advocacy  Wesley Weber had been a marijuana farmer in the past. In April 1999 he got arrested for exploiting a grow op in the basement of his home in Windsor and again in 2010 for planting marijuana in another farmer's field. That year, he was sentenced to 18 months of house arrest and 240 hours of community service. In September 2017 Weber used the alias 'Jeff Murray' to speak in front of the city councilors at Toronto's Licensing and Standards Committee and gave his recommendations on how they should regulate cannabis establishments. In October 2018, the Cannabis Act legalized the use of marijuana for recreational purpose in Canada. Weber declared that he helped finance a chain of cannabis stores named CAFE. His wife served as director of a company that owns one of the properties used by CAFE. She is also the guarantor of a 1.7 million dollar loan on that real estate.

Life He belonged to the recusant family of Mayhew or Mayow of Winton, near Salisbury, Wiltshire. On 10 July 1583, he entered with his elder brother Henry, the English College at Reims, where he displayed conspicuous talents, and received the tonsure and minor orders on 22 August 1590. Moving to Rome, he there continued his studies until his ordination, after which he left for the English mission in 1595. Having served for twelve years on the mission as a secular priest, he joined the Benedictine Order. He was professed by Dom Sigelbert Buckley, the sole survivor of the English congregation, in his cell at the Gatehouse prison, Westminster, on 21 November 1607, with Robert Sadler. Under these two new members the English congregation began to revive. Becoming affiliated with the Spanish congregation in 1612, it was given an equal share in St. Lawrence's monastery at Dieulwart, Lorraine, henceforth the centre of the English congregation. Retiring from the English mission in 1613, Mayhew took up his residence at Dieulwart, where he filled the office of prior from 1613 to 1620. The union of the three congregations engaged on the English missions had for some time been canvassed, in 1617 Mayhew was appointed one of the nine definitors to bring this about. That of the English and Spanish congregations was accomplished by the Apostolic Brief, \\"Ex incumbenti\\", of August, 1619, but the members of the Italian congregation refused to become united. From 1623 until his death he acted as vicar to the nuns at Cambrai. His remains lie in the parish church at St-Vedast.

The fort was one of the defensive structures built along Dere Street, a Roman road running from York to Corbridge and onwards to Melrose. The fort's name is from Habitanci on an altar set up by Marcus Gavius Secundinus a consular beneficiary on duty there. It is not mentioned in other sources such as the Notitia Dignitatum. Evidensca in the Ravenna Cosmography is highly unlikely to be a corrupted version of this name. Location The fort is situated north of Corbridge (Coria) and south of Rochester (Bremenium), the next Roman fort on Dere Street. It is west of the A68 road between Corbridge and Jedburgh, where the road crosses the River Rede at the village of West Woodburn. At this point Dere Street deviates westwards of the A68 and rejoins it a mile or two further north. Description The fort occupies a low mound overlooking the River Rede. It is oblong in shape and measures north to south, and east to west, giving an area of just over . It was surrounded by a number of ditches, which can still be seen on the south and west sides. The fort had gates in the south and west walls. There may have been gates in the other walls but no sign of them has been found. The walls were of sandstone ashlar, backed by a clay bank thirty feet thick. At the end of the 2nd century the fort was either abandoned or destroyed when large numbers of Roman troops were withdrawn. Later, the fort was rebuilt by the First Cohort of Vangiones, one thousand strong. Garrison The 2nd-century garrison is not known for certain, but may have been Cohors IV Gallorum equitata. The 3rd-century garrison was the First Cohort of Vangiones, as well as a Numerus Exploratorum (Unit of Scouts) and a detachment of Raeti Gaesati (pikemen). Current site The only visible stone remains lie at the north- eastern corner angle, but the outlines of many buildings can easily be made out beneath a layer of turf in the fort's interior, as can the ditches on all sides.

This family contains members in all animals. In humans there are three paralogous isoforms: *ELMO1 *ELMO2 *ELMO3 The ELMO domain was first characterized in the CED-12 proteins of Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, which is a homolog to the ELMO protein found in mammals. This protein is involved in Rac-GTPase activation, apoptotic cell phagocytosis, cell migration, and cytoskeletal rearrangements. Structure and function of ELMO proteins The ELMO family are evolutionarily conserved orthologs of the C. elegans protein CED-12. All isoforms contain a series of armadillo repeats, which begin at the N-terminus and extend around two thirds of the way along the protein, as well as a C-terminal proline-rich motif and a central PH domain. They function as part of a protein complex with Dock180-related proteins to form a bipartite guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac (a member of the Rho family of small G proteins). The Dock180-ELMO interaction requires the ELMO PH domain and also involves binding of the ELMO proline-rich motif to the Dock180 SH3 domain.

He moves along the cutting edge between experimental/improvised music and new music. He has developed a complex instrumental concept combining guitar and electronics/computer which he calls laptop guitar. He also plays several other string instruments including banjo, mandolin, and a variety of instruments from Central Asia, among them the Uzbek and the Persian dot√¢r. Gunnar Geisse has been living in Munich, Germany since 1985. Musical career Gunnar Geisse began his career in his early youth as a rock guitarist. With the end of his schooling he gravitated in the direction of jazz. Attending an Ornette Coleman concert at the Moers Jazz Festival in Germany, he saw Coleman carried onto the stage in a coffin, jump out dressed in a glittering disco outfit and play in the free jazz style that he helped create. After this key experience, Geisse bought toy plastic saxophones for the members of his band and threw away his original plan to play jazz standards. It was during this time that improvisation and an experimental approach became the foundation of his understanding of music. His first professional engagement was with the \\"New York Broadway Ensemble\\" with which he toured throughout Europe for the next two years. For Geisse, to be a part of an orchestra was an essential learning experience. The avant-garde combo \\"Brother Virus\\" which along with Geisse included Werner Klausnitzer, Patrick Scales, and Maurice de Martin, achieved fame at the end of the 1980s. It would leave a major impression on Geisse. The band was invited to play at the Knitting Factory in New York, and was one of the first bands to play serious improvised music \\"live\\" on prime time German TV ‚Äì Dagobert Lindlau's \\"Veranda\\". With \\"Brother Virus\\" Gunnar Geisse took the first steps on his own musical journey, a journey that was already apparent in his earlier development. In 1991 Enja Records released the \\"Brother Virus\\" album \\"Happy Hour\\". Geisse lost the two middle fingers on his right hand in a mountain climbing accident in 1992. With the severity of the injury and subsequent operations, it was unclear as to whether Geisse would be able to continue his playing career. It was during his hospital stays that he was able to contemplate the implications of 20th century new music compositional techniques, and in so doing discovered his deep interest in structure. He wrote his first composition during one of his hospital stays. For him to have a good aural understanding of the piece, he proceeded to overdub the tracks ‚Äì some 200 in total. Out of his interest in structure, Geisse worked together with the Institute for Experimental Physics at the University of Magdeburg in the area of complexity theory, non-linear phenomena and simulation, and inserted structural models of nature into his music. The recording was released under the title \\"AtEM\\". While judging a music composition competition, Hans Zender - conductor of the SWR symphony orchestra und professor for composition at the College of Music and Arts in Frankfurt, Germany - took notice of Geisse's extraordinary music. Subsequently Gunnar Geisse received a stipend to compose at the prestigious Schloss Solitude Academy for one year. It was at Solitude that he composed \\"Das diskrete Jetzt\\" (The Discrete Now). He delved deeper into the phenomena of musical time. On a renewed search for natural structural references, he received important suggestions and impetus from the Institute for Medical Psychology at the Ludwig-Maximilian University (LMU) in Munich on the theme \\"time and its perception\\". The classic compositional parameters of tempo, meter, and rhythm are pushed into the background by this broadening of perspective through a psychological perception of time. After his work with structure and time Gunnar Geisse again delved into questions concerning the fundamental functions of harmony. Searching for answers within nature since 2003, he has occupied himself with the non-linear phenomena of combination-tones - these are tones that are formed in the cochlea of the inner ear as an extension of the original acoustic signal. The combination-tones are the missing building blocks which, when added to his use of partial-tone rows and partial-tone matrixes, complete Geisse's set of harmonic compositional tools. The results of this work can be heard on the CD \\"MEtA\\" (Creative Sources Recordings). In 2006 Geisse wrote an exposition which lends insight into his specific harmonic concept. Paradoxically, with these compositional tonal explorations, sound- based improvisation and its physical, expressive moments have taken on more and more importance; Geisse's improvisational models have changed under these influences. Since 2005 working with electronics and laptop computers have become an important means of expression for Geisse. In this context he has developed a unique hardware/software set-up (laptop guitar) that allows him to pursue his analogue playing (guitar) on a digital level, and even more importantly, to break away from the restrictions of \\"instrument\\" in order to work more directly with sound and its formulation. Gunnar Geisse has received various awards and stipends, including the Musical Achievement Award of the City of Munich, and the Schloss Solitude Academy's Composition Stipend. Musical Collaborations Gunnar Geisse has played with musicians from the three major areas of his musical life: experimental/improvised music, new music, and contemporary jazz. They include: Richard Barrett, Marty Cook, Phil Durrant, Vinko Globokar, Barry Guy, Franz Hautzinger, Jason Kahn, Thomas Lehn, Michael Lentz, George Lewis, David Moss, G√ºnter M√ºller, Olga Neuwirth, Phill Niblock, Evan Parker, Giancarlo Schiaffini, Ignaz Schick, Ed Schuller, Mike Svoboda, Gary Thomas, Wu Wei, Xu Fengxia.

Maredsous Abbey  The brothers chose a picturesque site on an estate of Henri Descl√©e's in the Province of Namur for the erection of Maredsous Priory in which to establish the monks of Beuron Abbey, who had been driven out of Germany by the Kulturkampf and sought refuge in Catholic Belgium. With Dom Hildebrand de Hemptinne, a Belgian monk of that congregation (later Abbot Primate of the Benedictine Order), Jules Descl√©e had been a captain of the Pontifical Zouaves. Baron Jean-Baptiste Bethune, inspired by the same motive as the Descl√©e brothers for the restoration of Christian art, had attached his school of St. Luke to the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools. Dom Hildebrand's father, Joseph de Hemptinne, had been amongst the founders of the School of St. Luke (1862). Accordingly the monastery of Maredsous was constructed in the purest Gothic style of the thirteenth century, after the plans of Baron B√©thune.  Publishing  In the 1870s the Descl√©e brothers also founded an important printing establishment at Tournai, under the title of the Society of St. John the Evangelist, their object being to restore Christian art in liturgical publications. The aesthetic principles by which their enterprise was to be directed were those of the Middle Ages. Here also Baron Jean-Baptiste Bethune assisted them. At first the society relied on English workmen, compositors, and printers. The first publications attracted the attention of connoisseurs. The Society, following first the work of the Rev. Dom Pothier, and afterwards the studies of the Benedictines of Solesmes, issued the first publications for the re-establishment of the liturgical chant, commonly called \\"plain chant\\". These editions served as a basis for the edition brought out by the Vatican printing press, and imposed by Pope Pius X on the Catholic Church. About 1880 the Descl√©e brothers resolved to apply to other branches of Catholic literature the same principles of artistic restoration which had met with such success in the liturgical domain. Under the title of the Society of St. Augustine they founded a separate business, devoted to the publication of all kinds of books relating to ecclesiastical studies, ascetic theology, religious history and literature, hagiography, art, archaeology, education, etc. The production of religious images formed also an important part of the work of the society, at Bruges in Belgium, and at Lille in France. In 1881 the Descl√©e brothers took over the production of the Revue de l'art chr√©tien.

When the puppets move, their feet move along the railings, making it look as though they are actually walking upon the ground. The building (yatai) or painted backdrop (kakiwari) is attached to the partition farthest from the audience (main railing). Small curtain (Komaku) and Screened-off Rooms (Misuuchi) Looking at the stage from the audience, the right-hand side is called kamite (stage left), while the left-hand side is called shimote (stage right). The puppets make their appearance and then leave the stage through the small black curtains (komaku) at both stage left and stage right. The screened-off rooms are just above the small curtains, and they have bamboo blinds set up so that the audience cannot see inside. In the screened-off room at stage left (the audience's right), are young chanters and shamisen players of limited experience. In that on the opposite side, are the members of the hayashi (orchestra), who perform on such instruments as flutes, stick drums, hand drums, and bells, and even evoke the atmosphere of the scene by creating such sounds as wind, rain, and the flowing of a river.

The station also includes several historic wells, a period garage, and the man-made Fales Pond, a once-dammed section of the Neponset Reservoir near the pumphouse.

Description and history The Foxborough Pumping Station is located at the end of Pumping Station Road in northern Foxborough. It is located on , which include Fales Pond, now a section of the Neponset Reservoir, which impounds the headwaters of the Neponset River. The principal visible features of the station are its 1891 pumphouse, a Late Victorian brick building designed by Ernest Boyden, and a 1953 storage garage. Other features include several drilled wells dating to 1948, and a now-abandoned well field dating to the pumphouse's construction. The town of Foxborough, initial an agricultural town, grew as an industrial center in the 19th century, specializing in the manufacture of straw hats. The town's industrial owners and the rise in population led to the need for a reliable public water supply for improved public health and the fire protection of important industrial assets. After a report on the matter was issued in 1879, it lay dormant until 1889, when proposals were made after the construction of the Foxborough State Hospital renewed calls for improved fire protection. A proposal for the present siting of the station was approved by the town in 1891. Ernest Boyden, then already known for his designs of other public water supply pumping stations, was retained to design the new facility. Twenty-four shallow wells were dug to draw groundwater, which the main pump then distributed. In 1948 these were replaced by three deep wells, which draw from the aquifer underlying the Neponset Reservoir. A fourth well was drilled in 1972, replacing the #2 well, whose casing had cracked.

By 1835 Mortimer Blake was running a high school in the building that was proving so popular that it was overflowing despite the charges of 25 to 35 cents per week.

A town employee and public school parent discovered that the town of Croydon, New Hampshire also had a \\"one-room school house\\" whose building is fifty years older than the Red Brick School. The ensuing discussion focused on whether the term \\"one room\\" meant class space or actual rooms.

It includes three buildings: the Gothic Revival town hall, built 1878-79, the Stick style Winthrop Congregational Church (1878‚Äì80), and the 1881 Central Fire Station. These three buildings are arrayed along Mary Wales Holbrook Park, aka Holbrook Square. The square is located north and west of the junction of North Franklin Street (Massachusetts Route 37) and Union Street (Massachusetts Route 139). The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Description and history The town of Holbrook was originally part of Randolph, and began to achieve a separate identity with the formation of the Second Randolph Church (or East Parish) in 1818. A schism within the East Parish led to the formation of the Winthrop Congregational Church, whose first sanctuary was built in 1857-58. The town was incorporated in 1873, at which time its first town hall was built adjacent to the church. Both buildings were destroyed in a fire in December 1877. In its aftermath, a new town hall, church, and fire station were built in the town's central square. The town hall is the community's only significant example of High Victorian Gothic architecture. It is a substantial two story brick structure, with granite and sandstone trim elements. It was designed by John Lyman Faxon and built in 1878-79 by the Norcross Brothers construction firm. The Winthrop Congregational Church was designed by the Boston firm of Hartwell and Tilden, and was built, also by the Norcross Brothers, in 1878-80. It is the town's best preserved 19th-century church, and a fine example of Stick style architecture. The fire station, built in 1881, is the town's only example of Panel Brick architecture.

Early life His father was captain of cavalry Juan de Goyeneche y Aguerrevere and his mother was Mar√≠a Josefa de Barreda y Benavides, daughter of field marshal Don Nicol√°s de Barreda y Ovando, from a noble family of military men and conquistadors. He travelled when very young to Spain, to finish his studies, and entered the army as cadet, later raising to lieutenant of cavalry and captain of grenadiers. He took part of the defense of C√°diz against the British in two occasions, having been in command of two hundred grenadiers and two gun batteries in the second. Representative to the Supreme Junta In 1808, during the French invasion of the Iberian peninsula, he was commissioned as representative of the legitimate government of Spain to the Supreme Junta in Seville with the rank of brigadier, for the proclamation of king Ferdinand VII in the viceroyalties of Peru and River Plate, to ensure the fidelity and compliance of those colonies to the legitimate Spanish king, take the news of the general revolt against French invasion of Spain and ask of help from the colonies. His powers were vast, including firing and incarcerating anybody in public office (including viceroys) who manifested any opposission to Ferdinand VII, legitimate King of Spain. War in Upper Peru He travelled to Peru, where viceroy Abascal named him Captain General and president of the Real Audiencia of Cusco. In 1809 he took command of the Peruvian royalist armies in Upper Peru, sent to suppress the revolutionary forces at La Paz, even though this province belonged the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata. He defeated those forces and ordered the execution of a dozen of their leaders, then returned to Cusco. After receiving news of the May Revolution in Buenos Aires, Viceroy Abascal announced the incorporation of Upper Peru (present-day Bolivia) to the Viceroyalty of Peru. General Goyeneche organized new forces, but did not advance South until after the Battle of Suipacha, which left the region under control of the revolutionaries. In May 1811 he signed an armistice with the political leader of the independentist army Juan Jos√© Castelli, even though events betrayed that neither one was intending to abide by it. Castelli deployed part of his troops to try to surround Goyeneche's forces but Goyeneche employed his time better and attacked first. The ensuing battle of Huaqui on June 20, 1811 was a decisive victory for Goyeneche. In a few weeks afterwards he occupied the whole of Upper Peru, including the cities of La Paz, Cochabamba, Chuquisaca and Potos√≠, re-establishing Spanish control over the territory. His decisive victory at the Battle of Huaqui earned him the title of Count of Guaqui. The rebellion at Cochabamba took a year to suppress which delayed his invasion of the Salta Province, in present-day northern Argentina. After defeating the tough resistance of the Cochabamba locas, including women fighters he entered the city and repressed the rebel with severity which cost the lives of dozens of men, women and children. In 1813, general P√≠o de Trist√°n, under orders from Goyeneche, chased the Army of the River Plate South to Argentine territory. Trist√°n attacked the Belgrano's Army of the North and was defeated at the Battle of Tucum√°n. A few months later, Trist√°n was defeated again at the Battle of Salta, falling prisoner along with his whole army. Goyeneche's armies were left unprotected in their southern flank, which forced him to retreat towards Oruro. Goyeneche resigned as commander in chief and was substituted by Joaqu√≠n de la Pezuela, returning to Spain shortly afterwards. Return to Spain Upon returning to Spain, he was named Lieutenant General of the Royal Armies, member of the Junta for the Wars in the Indies, member of the War Council and president of the Junta for Overseas Commerce. He was also elected as deputy to the Cortes for Arequipa and senator of the realm for the Province of Canarias. King Ferdinand made him a peer, and also Knight of the Military Order of Santiago.

It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof clapboard siding, granite foundation, and a single off-center chimney. The front (north- facing) facade is symmetrically arranged, with a recessed central entrance flanked by sidelight windows. The sides of the recess are framed by simple pilasters, and topped by a cornice. Sash windows fill the remaining bays, with slightly gabled lintels. Behind the house stands a small barn, 1-1/2 stories in height, with a gable roof. The north facade is finished in clapboards, with the gable decorated by vergeboard. Based on architectural analysis, it was built in about 1850. The house was built about 1830, during a period of early industrial development in what was then an otherwise agrarian community. Its first notable owner was Daniel Clark Sanders, who lived in the house next door and owned this as one of several rental properties. Sanders, a minister, is notable as the first president of the University of Vermont, and was active locally in politics, serving as town selectman and in the state legislature. In 1860 the property was purchased by George Inness, an artist who became well known for his landscape paintings, based in part on his work done at is Medfield studio, which was located in the barn. Inness made a number of alterations to the barn for this purpose, plastering walls and adding skylights on the north side.

His poems centred on his comic creation ‚ÄòBhaiya‚Äô, who was used as a vehicle for biting satirical comment on all aspects of Indian society and culture. Ishar Singh‚Äôs compositions were delivered in his native language ‚Äì the particular form of Punjabi spoken in the Potwar region, which is now part of Pakistan. A tall, bespectacled Sikh, he published at least 12 poetic collections involving Bhaiya. But he lived in a time and place where culture was primarily transmitted by oral means, and where poetry was one of the chief forms of public entertainment. So it was in the mass public recitals ‚Äì or ‚Äòkavi darbars‚Äô ‚Äì that his works were most keenly and widely appreciated. Early life and career Ishar Singh was born on 12 December 1892 in Kaneti, near Rawalpindi, in the Potwar plateau of the Punjab. The area was then part of British India, but is now in Pakistan. He was the younger of two sons of Dhera Singh 'Shah', a wealthy money lender. But he showed no interest in money himself, instead displaying a prodigious early aptitude for poetry while studying at Sukho Khalsa High School. He was aged just 13 when his first poetic collection, Naurangiya Alum, was published locally by his headmaster.From \\"Kuch Apne Walon\\" (01/07/1955), p.95 in Bhaiya Ishar Singh Ishar di Kavita(1992), At 16 he moved to study at the prestigious Khalsa College in Amritsar, where he recited his religious poems every week in the gurdwaras of Sikhism's holiest city. He was married at 17 and moved to Karachi three years later to take his first job, a clerical role in the Post Office. This marked the beginning of a long career in the service, which he would combine with his ever burgeoning literary success. From Karachi he transferred to Lahore, considered the hub of Punjabi poetry, before moving on to work as a postmaster in his home district of Rawalpindi.Oral recollection by his only surviving son, Hardev Singh (July 2008) All the while he wrote poetry in his spare time, publishing his works in local journals and reading them out at public functions. These earlier compositions were serious in tone, usually on religious matters. He also composed romantic and melancholic works, which he was to later look back on with embarrassment.From \\"Kuch Apne Walon\\", p.96 in Bhaiya Ishar Singh Ishar di Kavita It was not until 1928 that he finally realised his true talent ‚Äì which was to make people laugh. It was in that year that he entered a competition held by Charan Singh Shahid, editor of the weekly satirical journal Mauji, inviting humorous poems on the subject of Fashiondaar Vauti (Fashionable Wife). Ishar Singh beat 69 other entrants - many of greater fame - to the first prize of two sovereigns.p.96, ibid The award marked a turning point in his life, highlighting fresh possibilities beyond the Post Office, and from then onwards his poems always looked to the lighter side of life. Poems Although intended to create laughter, Ishar Singh‚Äôs compositions were not simply a form of idle and frivolous entertainment. Rather, they were intended as a satire on common social, cultural and religious values. Ishar Singh used his piercing wit to puncture the pomposity of the rich and powerful, and to expose popular prejudices and injustices, many of which had been entrenched in the Indian psyche for centuries. Ishar Singh in caricature on the front cover of Dhesh Bhagat Bhaiya His acute observations touched on every aspect of life, from the minutiae of family relationships to matters of grand theology. No subject was taboo for him, and many of his pronouncements might be considered too close to the bone in today‚Äôs more politically correct age. His creation ‚ÄòBhaiya‚Äô was the medium through which Ishar Singh attacked the various hypocrisies, superstitions and other absurdities he observed around him. Bhaiya was used in various guises - sometimes as himself, sometimes as his father or any other character - depending on the subject matter. In total, Ishar Singh is thought to have composed over 2,500 poems, of which several hundred featured in 12 published collections: Bhaiya; Rangila Bhaiya; Nirala Bhaiya; Nava Bhaiya; Gurmukh Bhaiya; Bhaiya Tilak Piya; Bhaiya Vaid Rogian Da; Premi Bhaiya; Desh Bhagat Bhaiya; Mastana Bhaiya; Hansmukh Bhaiya and Oncemore Bhaiya. Although many of the poems in these books were written years, or even decades, earlier, most were not published until the last few years of his life. Indeed, it was only after retiring from the Post office in 1954 that Ishar Singh attained truly widespread fame. As late as 1955, when he had already published five books, he complained that his works were being denied a proper audience. He described how he had even been forcefully quietened in gurdwaras for reciting poems that were considered inappropriate in a holy setting.pp.96-97, ibid But it was in the same year that he made his ultimate breakthrough, when his poem Mera Marna (My Death) gained an audience on All India Radio. It caused an overnight sensation, and was quickly followed by Mera Jamna (My Birth).Oral recollection by Hardev Singh In the later years of his life, tens of thousands of people would turn up to his performances at kavi darbars, where he was usually the final - and most popular - act on the stage. He was in huge demand to speak at weddings and parties, but would never charge for his appearances. He had no need to, as audience members showered him with money and other gifts. Ishar Singh reciting his poetry in Kenya in 1959 One of his chief patrons was the Maharajah of Patiala Yadavindra Singh, but his poems were appreciated by a wide strata of society, and he was always at pains to retain the common touch. For although he was a well-read man whose poems displayed his full learning and erudition, they were always written in the earthy language of the Punjab. But while the language was often plain and somewhat rustic, there was a keen art behind the poetry, which employed carefully structured meter and rhyme. Many of his poems were delivered in rhyming couplets, while others used varying combinations of rhyming lines. It was through this mix of tight rhythmic structure, straightforward humour and - above all - fearless commentary, that Ishar Singh was eventually acknowledged in the field of Punjabi poetry as the 'Has Ras de Badshah' (King of Humour). He was handed this title by the Chief Minister of the Punjab, Pratap Singh Kairon, when he first read out Mera Marna on All India Radio. But it was a reputation he truly earned among his rivals after they set him the daunting challenge of turning his poetic wit to the most sombre event in Sikh history ‚Äì the martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur. In 1675, the religion's ninth founding Guru was publicly executed in the main thoroughfare in Delhi ‚Äì at the behest of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb - for refusing to convert to Islam. On the anniversary of the martyrdom nearly 300 years later, Ishar Singh rose to the challenge, and delivered his poem to a serious-minded audience in a Delhi maidan. Moments later, the audience was reportedly rolling around in amusement.Oral recollection by his grandson Daljit Singh (July 2008) In a delicate balancing act of tone and judgement, Ishar Singh lampooned the brutal and bloody intolerance of the Islamic rulers, while venerating the sanctity of the Guru‚Äôs ultimate sacrifice. Many observers considered this his finest work. Further background Although his family name was Chandhoke, he employed the common poetic construction of using his first name as a suffixed pen name. Thus he was known as Ishar Singh ‚ÄòIshar‚Äô. In practice, however, he came to be so closely identified with his best known comic creation that the name ‚ÄòBhaiya‚Äô was usually tagged to the end of his full title. He was married to Sita Wanti (died 1975), and had five sons and three daughters, who were all born in the Rawalpindi district. His son Narinjan Singh 'Narinjan' In 1946, a year before the Partition of India created Muslim Pakistan, the entire family ‚Äì by this time including grandchildren ‚Äì moved over to live in Delhi, which would soon become capital of the new Hindu- majority India. Ishar Singh transferred to the Post Office in Shimla in 1949, before retiring back to Delhi in 1954. He was to spend the rest of his days in the city, where he died of a heart attack on 15 January 1966, at the age of 73. The circumstances of his death were almost identical to those he described years earlier in Mera Marna. As a man, he paid little respect to the standing and reputation of others. He would keep ministers of state waiting if he felt too tired to see them at social gatherings, while he was known to ridicule the hosts of the very events he was speaking at. Even those who knew him best said it was difficult to get too close, as he was so entirely absorbed in his writings. His relatives recall how on one occasion, while staying with his son in Kenya in 1959, he journeyed to a park to work on his poetry. He removed his turban, jacket and shoes, and placed them beside him on a bench, before immersing himself in his notebook. It was only when he stopped writing, several hours later, that he noticed his clothing had been stolen. And when his son subsequently took him to report the theft at the police station, Ishar Singh could not even recall the colour of his own turban, jacket and shoes - such had been his dedication to his art that morning.Oral recollection by his grandson Kultaran Singh (July 2008) Several of his descendants became well known in their own right. His eldest son, Hardit Singh (1919‚Äì1993), set up the successful Delhi-based firm Ditz Electricals, which still manufactures and supplies household appliances around India to this day. Ishar Singh's second son, Narinjan Singh ‚ÄòNarinjan‚Äô (1921‚Äì1991), was the only one of his children to carry on the family poetic tradition. Narinjan Singh regularly recited his own compositions - as well as those of his father - at social gatherings and kavi darbars, first in Delhi, then in Nairobi where he later moved, and finally, towards the end of his life, when he lived in Derby in the UK.

The asylum was established in 1892 as the state's first facility for dealing with chronic mental patients. The college- like campus was designed by William Pitt Wentworth and developed between 1896 and 1914. After an era dominated by asylums built using the Kirkbride Plan, Medfield Insane Asylum was the first asylum built using the new Cottage Plan layout. It was formally renamed \\"Medfield State Hospital\\" in 1914. At its height the complex included 58 buildings, on a property of some , and a capacity of 2,200 patients. It raised its own livestock and produce, and generated its own heat, light and power. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994, the property was closed in April 2003 and the buildings shuttered. The grounds have been reopened to the public and are open every day from sun up to sundown. It has been used as a filming location for thriller/horror motion pictures such as The New Mutants, Shutter Island, and The Box. As of July 2012, The Clark Building was demolished. Local Medfield Police now patrol the facility. Trespassing is strictly forbidden past dark and until sunrise. Within the grounds of the hospital lies the Medfield State Hospital Cemetery which has 841 gravesites. This cemetery was opened from 1918 until 1988. Originally, only numbers were on the graves in this cemetery until a Boy Scout from Troop 89 made it his Eagle Scout service project to find the names and dates of death of all those buried in the cemetery. Starting in October 2013 demolition of three buildings was completed; The Odyssey House, the Carriage House, and the Laundry Building.

The current Peak House, however, was built in 1711 as an ell to the rebuilt house, and was moved to its current location in 1762 when the rebuilt house began to deteriorate. It is one of the oldest houses in Medfield and one of the earliest surviving examples of post-medieval English (Elizabethan) architecture in the United States. Some of the original panes of imported English glass in the windows can still be seen today. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and has the highest pitched roof on record in Massachusetts for a colonial American house. On October 18, 1924, the Peak House was deeded to the Medfield Historical Society by its then-owners, Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Mason Smith, after which the house received a down-to-the-frame restoration. The house has served both as a dwelling and an historical site, as well as an artist's studio and workshop.

It encompasses the historic mid-to-late-19th century village center of the town, including the residential area north of Main Street, two 19th-century industrial complexes, and civic and institutional buildings. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Description and history The area that is now Millis was settled by the English in the 1640s, and was for many years part of Medway before being separately incorporated in 1885. Its town center developed around a north-south route, now Massachusetts Route 115 (partly Exchange Street and partly Plain Street); and an east-west route now designated in sections as Exchange Street, Curve Street and Union Street. The much straighter Main Street, now Massachusetts Route 109, was built in 1809 as the Hartford and Dedham Turnpike, and the railroad was built through the area between the east-west routes in the 1850s. The town was predominantly agrarian until the 1880s, when reliable rail service was introduced. Lansing Millis, for whom the town is named, opened a shoe factory, steel factory, and bottling plant there, and was responsible for the town's growth as an industrial center. The historic district extends along Main Street from Exchange to Plain Street, and along the curving route of Exchange, Curve and Union Streets, from Main Street in the west to its eastern railroad junction. It also extends northward along Exchange Street from its junction with Curve. The district, in size, includes civic, commercial, industrial and residential properties. Most of its buildings were erected after 1850, with only four houses and one church (the First Parish Church at 142 Exchange Street) constructed earlier. The oldest house, dating from the mid-18th century, is that of John Richardson, a typical Georgian colonial at 191 Curve Street.

Washington.Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was a thriving and important city during the American Civil War, and provided a significant source of personnel, war materiel, armament, ammunition, and supplies to the Union Army. Situated at the confluence of the Monongahela, Allegheny and Ohio rivers, Pittsburgh was an important transportation hub for both riverine and rail transport, as well as overland via its system of roads. Production of material The antebellum iron industry in Pittsburgh had thrived, fueled by access to coal, iron ore, and other raw materials, as well as transportation routes to get the iron to markets. In 1859, the Clinton and Soho iron furnaces introduced coke- fired smelting to the region. Within three years, the growing needs of the military effort during the Civil War had boosted the city's economy with increased production of iron and armaments, especially at the Allegheny Arsenal and the Fort Pitt Foundry.Boucher, A Century and a Half of Pittsburg and Her People. Arms manufacture included ironclad warships and the world's first 21\\" heavy artillery gun.Thurston, Allegheny County's Hundred Years. By war's end, over one-half of the steel and more than one-third of all U.S. glass was produced in Pittsburgh.Meislik and Galloway, \\"History of Pittsburgh.\\" During the war, Pittsburgh's heavy industry provided significant quantities of weapons and ammunition. The Fort Pitt Foundry made mammoth iron castings for giant siege howitzers and mortars, among the largest guns in the world. One of the largest was a 20-inch bore Rodman Gun, a large black powder, smoothbore, muzzle-loading coastal defense gun. The foundry produced 1,193 guns (15 percent of the total U.S. wartime artillery production) and almost 200,000 artillery projectiles. Other prominent Pittsburgh area factories included Singer, Nimick and Co. (maker of 3\\" Ordnance rifles) and Smith, Park and Co., which produced more than 300,000 projectiles. Pittsburgh industries collectively manufactured 10 percent of the total U.S. wartime production of artillery rounds. The Allegheny Arsenal was the primary military manufacturing facility for U.S. Army accoutrements, as well as saddles and other cavalry equipment. In addition, the sprawling factory produced as many as 40,000 bullets and cartridges every day (more than 14 million per year), supplying between 5 and 10 percent of the Army's annual small arms ammunition requirements. A significant explosion on the afternoon of September 17, 1862 (coincidentally on the same day as the Battle of Antietam in central Maryland), killed 78 factory workers, mostly young women. Five Ellet-class rams were converted from civilian towboats at Pittsburgh. In addition, four ironclads were built from the keel up‚Äîthe USS Manayunk, Marietta, Sandusky, and Umpqua. Pittsburgh's rolling mills supplied the armor for many of the ironclads that were built in New York City and Philadelphia for the Union Navy. The city's 110-year run of hosting a major stock exchange can be traced to the oil traded at Pittsburgh during the war with the creation of Thurston's Oil Exchange on Fourth Avenue, downtown. Defending Pittsburgh Both Morgan's Raid from the west and Jones-Imboden Raid from the south came within a day's march of the city before being captured or forced to retreat. Concerned that the Confederate Army might target Pittsburgh for invasion, the U.S. War Department established the Department of the Monongahela to provide a formal Federal military presence in Western Pennsylvania during the Gettysburg Campaign, with departmental headquarters in Pittsburgh. The Army dispatched Maj. Gen. William T. H. Brooks to organize the defenses of Pittsburgh. Brooks authorized the construction of several miles of earthworks and a series of small forts to control access to the city. He suspended liquor sales, and put the citizenry to work digging trenches and erecting forts. Bars and saloons were asked to close but many refused. Among these bastions was Fort Robert Smalls, a redoubt built by free blacks on McGuire's Hill at the mouth of Becks Run in Arlington Heights. Another of these emergency fortifications was the circular earthwork known as Fort Laughlin, constructed by the employees of Jones and Laughlin Steel on Ormsby's Hill, now part of Arlington Park on Arlington Avenue. It was also known as Fort McKinley or Fort Ormsby. Concurrent with Fort Laughlin, Jones and Laughlin Steel employees constructed Fort Jones, named for the mill's co-owner, Benjamin Franklin Jones . Fort Jones occupied the top of a hill in Mount Oliver. It was sometimes known as Fort Jackson, in honor of Brig. Gen. Conrad Feger Jackson, killed in the Battle of Fredericksburg, Virginia, in December 1862.http://www.post- gazette.com/stories/local/civilwar/tour-to-visit-likely-sites-of-pittsburghs- civil-war-forts-691993/ There was also Fort Black, in Greenfield.

It operates the KC-10 Extender aircraft conducting air refueling missions. The squadron is one of the oldest in the United States Air Force, its origins dating to 19 May 1917, being organized at Kelly Field, Texas. The squadron deployed to England as part of the American Expeditionary Force during World War I. During World War II, the squadron saw combat service as a B-17 Flying Fortress unit, assigned to the Fifteenth Air Force in Italy. During the early years of the Cold War, it was an RB-47 Stratojet Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron as part of Strategic Air Command (SAC). History=World War I The squadron's origins begin on 19 May 1917, about a month after the United States' entry into World War I. On that date a group of recruits were organized at Kelly Field, Texas under the title of the Second Provisional Company, F. That was later changed to First Provisional Company E. At Kelly Field, the new Army recruits received basic military indoctrination by having drill in the mornings, then spending the balance of each day in the construction of facilities at the new camp, building roads, barracks and aircraft hangars in the afternoons. On 30 June the company was given the permanent designation of the 32d Aero Squadron.Gorell, On 11 August, orders were received for the 32d to deploy to France. The 30th to 37th Aero Squadrons were sent as a group to Fort Totten, New York, and embarked on the RMS Baltic on 23 August for their trans-Atlantic voyage. They arrived on 15 September at Liverpool, England, where 50 men of the group were selected to remain to train for aircraft mechanic instruction with the Royal Air Force. The balance of the squadron were ordered to Le Harve, France, arriving on 18 September. There most of the men of the group were sent to various French aviation schools for training to maintain French aircraft. The remainder of the group was designated as the 32d Aero Squadron and sent to the new Issoudun Aerodrome in Central France. There the squadron was engaged in construction activities, building roads, barracks and hangars for what was designated as the 3d Air Instructional Center. The 32d Aero Squadron remained at Issoudun Aerodrome for the balance of the war, engaging in construction activities at the facility as it grew and expanded. By the end of the war, the complex had grown to fifteen different airfields, all with support buildings and facilities. In November 1918, the 32d was reassigned to the Third Army Air Service, being moved to Trier Airdrome, in the Rhineland of Germany to repair the facility for use by the Air Service. In early January 1919, orders for demobilization were received and the squadron moved to a Base Port at Bordeaux, France for the return voyage back to the United States. It remained at the base camp until March, when it finally sailed for New York, arriving at Mitchel Field about 5 April. There the men of the 32d Aero Squadron were demobilized and returned to civilian life. The squadron was itself demobilized formally on 14 April 1919. Inter-war years The squadron was reconstituted in the Army Air Service as the 32d Bombardment Squadron on 24 March 1923. It was assigned to the 7th Bombardment Group. however it was not organized or activated until 24 June 1932 when it was assigned to the 19th Bombardment Group at Rockwell Field, San Diego, California. The 32d was equipped with Keystone B-3 bombers. It was moved in 1935 along with the group to the new March Field, near Riverside, where it received a mix of Martin B-10 and B-12 monoplane bombers.Clay, In the late 1930s, the 32d received B-18 Bolo medium and early model YB-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers. In 1940, it received the new B-17B Flying Fortress, the first production version of the B-17. The squadron was reassigned to Albuquerque Army Air Base, New Mexico on 4 June 1941. Its purpose was to train air and ground crews for reconnaissance and bombing duty with the B-17 before deployment to Clark Field in the Philippine Islands. On 23 November it moved to Hamilton Field, California to stage for its subsequent movement to Clark Field. It was at Hamilton Field on 7 December 1941 during the Pearl Harbor Attack.Mitchell, Upon the outbreak of World War II, the 32d moved to Muroc Army Airfield, its mission was antisubmarine patrols along the Southern California coast. On 16 December it was attached to the provisional Sierra Bombardment Group, where it mission was antisubmarine patrol duty. However, as conditions in the Philippines worsened, the Air Echelon B-17s departed via Hawaii on 17 December. Upon arrival at Hickam Field, the aircraft were pressed into service for defensive reconnaissance patrols around the Hawaiian Islands. The Ground Echelon at Muroc was concurrently dissolved and personnel assigned to other units.Hallion, World War II Fully bombed up, B-17F 42-5145 the 32d Bomb Squadron was photographed en route to Viterbo Airfield, Italy on 29 July 1943. Assigned to the group seven months earlier, this aircraft had completed 62 missions by the time it was transferred on to the 86th BS/2 BG in November 1943. Having passed the 100-mission mark, 42-5145 was lost on its 102nd combat sortie when it was shot down by German fighters over Fedora, Italy, on 11 March 1944. Six crewmen bailed out. The squadron was reformed in the United States in March 1942, by a redesignation of the newly established 354th Bombardment Squadron. It trained under Second Air Force. It flew antisubmarine patrols off the California coast from late May to early June 1942, then over the Mid-Atlantic coast from June to July 1942. The squadron deployed to European Theater of Operations (ETO) in August 1942, being assigned to VIII Bomber Command, one of the first B-17 heavy bomb squadrons assigned to England. It engaged in strategic bombardment operations over occupied Europe, attacking enemy military and industrial targets. It was reassigned to Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) as part of Operation Torch invasion of North Africa. It operated from desert airfields in Algeria and Tunisia during North African and Tunisian campaign. It was assigned to Northwest African Strategic Air Force during the invasion of Sicily, and later Italy in 1943. It was allocated to Fifteenth Air Force for strategic bombing of Nazi Germany and occupied Europe. It attacked enemy targets primarily in the Balkans, Southern France, Southern Germany and Austria from southern Italy. It engaged in shuttle bombing missions to airfields in the Soviet Union during the summer of 1944. Personnel were largely demobilized after German capitulation in May 1945. The squadron was reassigned to the United States and was programmed for conversion to B-29 Superfortress operations and deployment to Pacific Theater. Plans were canceled after Japanese capitulation in August 1945. The aircraft were sent to storage and the unit was inactivated largely as a paper unit in October 1945. Cold War It was reactivated in 1946 as a Strategic Air Command B-29 squadron. It was deployed to Furstenfeldbruck AB, Germany, July‚ÄìAugust 1948; to RAF Station Scrampton, England, October 1948-January 1949; and to RAF Stations Lakenheath and Sculthorpe, May‚ÄìNovember 1950 for \\"show of force\\" missions in Europe as a result of the Berlin Blockade by the Soviet Union and rising Cold War tensions in Europe. B-52D-70-BO 56-0582 being refueled by KC-135A-BN 55-3127 The squadron was equipped in 1953 with B-47 Stratojets, and trained with electronic countermeasures from 1958‚Äì1964. In 1965 the squadron was redesignated 32d Air Refueling Squadron and assumed the mission, personnel and equipment of the 321st Air Refueling Squadron, which was simultaneously inactivated, at Lockbourne Air Force Base. The unit performed air refueling operations worldwide from 1965‚Äì1979 and since 1981. From c. 10 June‚Äì8 October 1972, all personnel and aircraft were on loan to units in the Pacific or other Strategic Air Command units, leaving the squadron unmanned. It deployed most aircraft and personnel to Southeast Asia October‚ÄìDecember 1972, in support of Operation Linebacker II. It again deployed aircrews and tankers to various locations for air refueling support in Southwest Asia from August 1990‚ÄìApril 1991.

Inspired by traveling carnivals of the 1930s, Carniv√†le Lune Bleue () is a live entertainment event created in Ottawa, Canada by Executive Producer and Founder Wayne Van De Graaff. Van De Graaff has stated that he was inspired to pursue his lifelong dream and recreate a vintage Depression-era carnival after watching the HBO series Carniv√†le.\\"Under The Big Top\\" by Bruce Deachman, Ottawa Citizen, July 31, 2008. Carniv√†le Lune Bleue made its world debut in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada on July 31, 2008 (special media sneak preview night)\\"Carnivale Pitches Tent in Kars\\" by Aedan Helmer, Ottawa Sun, August 1, 2008. and officially opened to the public for an initial month-long run on August 1, 2008.\\"Authentic 1930s Carnival Makes North American Debut in Ottawa\\", June 24, 2008. In 2009, Carnivale Lune Bleue performed from July 23 - August 30 at Hog's Back Park in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The opening weekend of the 2009 performance featured a special appearance by Adrienne Barbeau who played Ruthie the Snake Dancer in Carniv√†le, the HBO series. Carniv√†le Lune Bleue has been described as \\"offering a visceral peek into the life of a Depression-era road show.\\"\\"Blast From Dark Past\\" by Denis Armstrong, Ottawa Sun, August 1, 2008. Creation Carniv√†le Lune Bleue is the creation of Wayne Van De Graaff, a former international tax and human resources expert who wanted to pay homage to and resurrect the Depression-era traveling carnivals he recalls hearing about from his grandparents while growing up in Utah. In developing Carniv√†le Lune Bleue, Van De Graaff recruited an international team of circus and carnival advisors, including Johnny Meah who is fondly known as \\"The Czar of Bizarre\\"Johnny Meah's Official Website. and famous for his work as a carnival advisor and historical consultant for the HBO show Carniv√†le\\", Claude Le Belle who was one of Cirque du Soleil's first \\"Tent Masters\\" and now owns his own company (http://www.sollertia.ca/), Jan-Rok Achard, an internationally renowned circus historian who was instrumental in founding the National Circus School in Montreal (http://www.nationalcircusschool.ca/en/home), Gilles Renaud who worked with the Montreal International Jazz Festival and other entertainment ventures, Holde Unverzagt who painted numerous show fronts and banners for amusement parks and carnivals, and Jim Conklin of Conklin Show's - the largest amusement show provider in Canada since the 1920s (http://conklinshows.com/), to create the most lifelike and authentic old-fashioned carnival experience. Piece by piece, Wayne Van De Graaff sought out the essential elements to create Carniv√†le Lune Bleue. He is adamant that every aspect of the event be as authentic as possible, \\"We have a spectacular 1938 Allen Herschell three- abreast wooden carousel and the first ever Big Top used by Cirque du Soleil,\\" he explains. \\"Every tent on the grounds is an authentic recreation of the canvas tents not used or seen since the 1940s.\\" History of traveling carnivals Throughout the late 19th Century up to the middle of the 20th century, North America enjoyed the entertainment of traveling carnivals. These carnivals featured circus-style performances, vaudeville or burlesque shows, games of skill and chance, freak shows, sideshows, fortune tellers, and rides such as the carousel and Ferris wheel. Carnivals became particularly popular during the depression years, sometimes known as the \\"Dirty Thirties,\\" and by 1937 it is estimated that more than 300 carnivals were touring North America. The carnival would seemingly \\"blow\\" unpredictably into town, setting up in empty farmland on the edge of a community and transforming the field into an ocean of colourful tents and banners overnight. Without warning, after several weeks, the carnies would tear down and pack up, heading back to the sawdust trail to seek out their next location. Attractions The front gates of Carniv√†le Lune Bleue. Carniv√†le Lune Bleue 2008 and 2009 lineup featured the following main attractions:Carniv√†le Lune Bleue's Official Website. Big Top main event ft. Cirque Maroc The main event is the Cirque Maroc performance in the vintage Big Top canvas tent. This show features internationally trained circus artists and former Cirque du Soleil trained performers in a 70-minute showcase of acrobatics, trapeze, contortionism, juggling, aerial rope and other such feats inspired by Depression-era circus, cabaret, burlesque and vaudeville shows. The Big Top used for the Cirque Maroc performance is in itself a piece of circus history in that it was the first tent ever used by Cirque du Soleil Cirque Maroc is produced specifically for Carniv√†le Lune Bleue by Production √âclats de Rire (Artistic Directors and Administrators: Nicolette Hazewinkel & Rodrigue Tremblay; Production Manager: Gilles Renaud; Director: Pierre Potvin). Ten-in-One freak show ft. Carnival Diablo An homage to the freak shows of the original traveling circuses, the Ten-in-One show features acts such as fire-eating, sword swallowing, and the human dartboard. The freak show also involves a guillotine and an electric chair, an act that leaves audiences with \\"clasped hands over gaping mouths and (holding) their collective breath in awe.\\" The Ten-in-One show is produced for Carniv√†le Lune Bleue by Scott McClelland of Carnival Diablo (a successful Canadian touring freak show).Carnival Diablo's Official Website. McClelland has deep roots in the industry and enthusiastically signed on to perform his show in the old-style carnival revival, as his grandfather was involved with the largest traveling circus sideshow in Canada from 1920 to 1968. The show features McClelland himself as \\"Nikolai Diablo\\", Sword Swallower Extraordianire; Istv√°n Bety√°r, Countess Vanessa and the Illustrated Strongman; The Mighty Leviticus. Tropical Terrors: Great Snakes of the World The Tropical Terrors: Great Snakes of the Word show features snakes and bugs from all over the world, including a giant rock python. There are also boa constrictors, anacondas, spiders, rattlers and other types of pythons, all available in a space-controlled, interactive environment. The Tropical Terrors show is produced for Carniv√†le Lune Bleue by Little Ray's Reptile Zoo (the largest reptile rescue group in Canada and a successful touring zoo across Eastern Ontario).Little Ray's Reptile Zoo's Official Website. The Magical Midway Carniv√†le Lune Bleue also features original, restored carnival rides, including a 1938 Allan Herschell Company vintage carousel and a 1917 Eli Bridge No. 5 Ferris wheel. For safety reasons, seatbelts were installed and the original gasoline engine that ran the Ferris wheel has been replaced with an electric one. The Magical Midway also includes a clairvoyant caravan, a variety of carnival games of skill, a Banner Line (a large art exhibit of carnival banners), a Grab Joint and Candy Joint (with classic carnival drinks and candies), and a vintage 1920s high striker. The Congress of Wonders Museum The one-of-a-kind Congress of Wonders tented exhibit features numerous artifacts, images and displays from the golden age of traveling carnivals including a freaks photo gallery, the infamous Turtle Boy, a genuine bed of nails and the Jersey Devil. The Congress of Wonders Museum is presented by the North American Carnival Museum and Archives (http://www.nacma.org). The Cookhouse A full-service restaurant that pays tribute to classic cuisine from the 1930s is also part of Carniv√†le Lune Bleue. The Cookhouse features an open kitchen (built on site specifically for the performance run) and a host of dishes that were popular during the Great Depression. Future performances The carnival's founder, Wayne Van De Graaff, planned to take the show on the road in future years, making it a real, traveling carnival.‚ÄúWhen the Carniv√†le Came to Town‚Äù by Jordan Timm, Maclean‚Äôs August 6, 2009 ReferencesExternal links * Category:Entertainment companies of Canada Category:Traveling carnivals ","title":"Carniv√†le Lune Bleue"},{"id":"18678454","text":"The Israel Whitney House is a historic house at 963 Central Avenue in Needham, Massachusetts.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Joshua Lewis House stands in a residential area of southeastern Needham, on the south side of South Street between its junctions with Green Street and Needhamdale Road. It is set on overlooking the Charles River. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof that extends down to the first floor in the rear, giving the house a saltbox profile. Its exterior is clad in wooden siding, and it has a brick central chimney. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by sidelight windows. The interior follows a typical center-chimney plan, with an narrow entrance vestibule, parlors on either side of the chimney, and long kitchen behind the chimney. It retains original period fireplace surrounds and other woodwork. There are modern additions extending to the south and northeast. The house was built in 1776 by Joshua Lewis, on land originally belonging to his wife's family. Little is known of the Lewises; his wife, Mary Lyons, was the daughter of a prominent local landowner. The first notable owner of the house was David Livingston, a regionally prominent woodcarver whose credits include work in the Massachusetts State House. In 1874 the house was purchased by Denys Zirngiebel, a Swiss horticulturalist who served as an early director of the Arnold Arboretum. Zirngiebel was a proteg√© of Louis Agassiz, and was friends with Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who is known to have visited here. Longfellow is said to have mentioned a tree on this property in his poem \\"To the River Charles\\". Zirngiebel's daughter Henriette married Andrew Wyeth, the father of artist N.C. Wyeth. Wyeth purchased the house in 1921, and used it as a home and studio for a number of years.

The 2-1/2 story wood frame house has at its core elements of a house that was built on the site in about 1720. The old house, built by Deacon Timothy Kingsbury, became the significantly-altered nucleus of a larger house built in 1840 by Edward Whitaker, a prominent local businessman. With further additions, the building encapsulates more than 200 years of construction methods. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The Kingsbury-Whitaker House is located on the north side of Glendoon Street, just east of its junction with Nehoiden Street and a short way north of Great Plain Avenue (Massachusetts Route 135). The latter two roads are historically old roads, dating to the early period of the area's settlement. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, twin interior chimneys, and a fieldstone foundation under its eastern half. Additions extend the building to the west, north, and northeast. Its main facade, facing south, is symmetrically arranged, with a center entrance flanked by sidelight windows and sheltered by a gabled porch. Deacon Timothy Kingsbury purchased the land on which this house stands in 1702, and was one of the leaders of the effort to incorporate Needham, which succeeded in 1711. He is known to have built a house on his land c. 1710, and local historians typically ascribed that date to this house. However, a detailed analysis of the construction of its oldest portion, the eastern half, revealed it was built using methods that only came into use after about 1720. Kingsbury lived in the house until 1740, serving in a variety of town offices and in the colonial assembly. The house remained in Kingsbury family hands until 1839, when it was sold to Edgar Whitaker, a Boston businessman. Whitaker made substantial alterations to the house, giving the main block its present appearance. His addition to the western end of the house required relocation of Nehoiden Street, which was moved west of its original route. Whitaker was, like Kingsbury, active in local politics, serving in the state legislature and on the Governor's Council. It was in part through his efforts that the railroad was routed through Needham. Subsequent owners of this house made numerous additions (including the removal of some to be replaced by others, but the main block was not substantially altered. As a result, the entire house, including its additions, represent a snapshot of more than 200 years of building methods.

This cluster of mainly residential buildings, surrounding the junction of Great Plain Avenue and Central Street, declined in importance when the railroad bypassed it, resulting the eventual relocation of the town's village center to its present location, about to the east. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The town of Needham, a suburb west of Boston, was settled in the early 18th century and incorporated in 1711. The approximate routes of both Great Plain Avenue and Central Street were originally trails used by Native Americans, and were developed into roads by the colonial settlers. The original town center was located about to the north, and this junction grew as a secondary node of development in the late 18th century. Opposition to the routing of the railroad parallel to Central Avenue through the center and this junction resulted in its placement further to the east in 1853, after which the area declined in importance. The district, about in size, includes fifteen historically significant properties (and ten that are not), centered at the junction of Great Plain Avenue and Central Street, extending in each direction for only a short distance. The most prominent building in the district is the Presbyterian Church, a modern building. It is the cohesive character of the residential buildings that gives the district its character. Virtually all of them are wood frame structures, 2-1/2 stories in height, and between 3 and 5 bays wide. Most are five bays wide, a typical late colonial or Federal period form, with a center entrance and two interior chimneys. The oldest house in the district, the Daniel Kingsbury House (1794), is typical of this form. Originally Federal in style, it was later modified with Greek Revival and Colonial Revival alterations.

It encompasses Needham Town Hall, a Georgian Revival structure built in 1902 to a design by Winslow & Bigelow, and the grassy public park in front of it, which was established in 1884. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history Needham Town Hall is located in the village center of the town, which is roughly near its geographic center. It is set between Chapel Street (west) and Highland Avenue (east), and faces south, across the town common to Great Plain Avenue (Massachusetts Route 135). It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a gabled slate roof and granite foundation. A tower, housing a bell and clock, rises to a golden dome atop the building. The building's first floor is finished in a rusticated manner, and is separated from the finer second floor by a granite stringcourse. At the center of the main facade are three round-arch openings, sheltering the recessed building entrance. Most of the windows are sashes topped by round arch sections. Pilasters separate the bays on the second floor, and support a frieze and modillioned cornice below the roof. The roof is encircled by a low balustrade. The town common is separated from town hall by a curving drive. It is a grassy rectangular area, with walkways crossing it and occasional plantings of trees and shrubs. Fronting Great Plain Avenue is an area with a flagpole and a brick memorial wall. Needham was settled in 1680 and incorporated (out of Dedham) in 1711. It was a mainly agricultural area, with industry center on the Charles River in its northernmost areas. Its town center was at the junction of Central Avenue and Nehoiden Street, about to the west of the present center. When the railroad was routed around that center in 1853, the area then known as Great Plain Village became the dominant commercial and civic area. In 1884 the town purchased the land for the common and town hall, to create a new central civic point in the growing village. The town hall, designed by Winslow and Bigelow of Boston, was completed in 1903. Its upper level, originally an open hall, was used for town meetings and all manner of social gatherings until 1952, when it was subdivided into offices.

The interior has a typical center-chimney plan, with a narrow winding stairway in the front vestibule, in front of the original central chimney. The house was built in 1707 by Robert Fuller, a prominent local resident from one of the area's early families. It originally stood where 46 Burrill Lane is, and was moved by Fuller in 1750 to its present location to make way for a new house. It is the oldest house in Needham. As built in 1707, it was a typical double- pile house with central chimney; the leanto was added after the house was moved. IN 1823 it was sold out of the Fuller family to the Greenwoods, who owned it until 1896. In the early 20th century, the additions were made to the side and rear, and the central chimney replaced by the present one.

Built in 1743, it is a well-preserved example of mid-18th century architecture, which was occupied for nearly two centuries by members of two of Needham's early families. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Tolman-Gay House is located in what is now a residential area west of the town center, on the east side of Central Avenue just south of its junction with Gay Street. It is a two-story wood frame structure, originally built in an L shape, and now covered by a hipped roof. It has a narrow three-bay facade roughly facing west toward the street, and is elongated by the addition of a modern kitchen and garage to the rear. The old portion of the house has a central chimney dividing the ground floor into a parlor and a kitchen. The interior retains period finishes and woodwork. The house was built in 1743 by Nathaniel Tolman, around the time of his marriage. Tolman's son John was prominent in the local militia, serving in the American Revolutionary War in the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the Siege of Boston, and the Saratoga campaign. He remained active in the militia after the war, and was activated for the War of 1812 but saw no service. Tolman was also active in civic affairs, serving as assessor and as an agent in negotiations over the separation of Needham's West Parish (now Wellesley). The house's next owner was Jonathan Gay, a military compatriot of Tolman's who was also from an old Needham family. Gay was a schoolteacher and served in the state legislature. The house remained in the Gay family until 1923.

He first achieved fame in the 1970s emerging from the London punk rock scene as a member of Generation X. Subsequently, he embarked on a solo career which led to international recognition and made Idol a lead artist during the MTV-driven \\"Second British Invasion\\" in the United States. The name \\"Billy Idol\\" was inspired by a schoolteacher's description of him as \\"idle\\". Idol began his music career in late 1976 as a guitarist in the punk rock band Chelsea. However, he soon left the group. With his former bandmate Tony James, Idol formed the band Generation X. With Idol as lead singer, the band achieved success in the United Kingdom and released three albums on Chrysalis Records, then disbanded. In 1981, Idol moved to New York City to pursue his solo career in collaboration with guitarist Steve Stevens. His debut studio album, Billy Idol (1982), was a commercial success. With music videos for singles \\"Dancing with Myself\\" and \\"White Wedding\\" Idol soon became a staple of then-newly established MTV. Idol's second studio album, Rebel Yell (1983), was a major commercial success, featuring hit singles \\"Rebel Yell\\" and \\"Eyes Without a Face\\". The album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of two million copies in the US. In 1986, he released Whiplash Smile. Having accumulated three UK top 10 singles (\\"Rebel Yell\\", \\"White Wedding\\" and \\"Mony Mony\\") Idol released a 1988 greatest hits album titled Idol Songs: 11 of the Best; the album went platinum in the United Kingdom. Idol then released Charmed Life (1990) and the concept album Cyberpunk (1993). Idol spent the second half of the 1990s out of the public eye focusing on his personal life. He made a musical comeback with the release of Devil's Playground (2005) and again with Kings & Queens of the Underground (2014). Life and career=1955‚Äì1975: Early life Idol was born William Michael Albert Broad on 30 November 1955 in Stanmore, Middlesex. He is of Irish descent on his mother's side. His parents were devout Anglicans and attended church regularly. In 1958, when he was two years old, he moved with his parents to Patchogue, New York. They also lived in Rockville Centre, New York.

It was fun, you know?\\"ConcertVault interview 21 November 1983 In another interview for BBC Breakfast in October 2014, he said that he wanted to use the name \\"Billy Idle\\", but thought the name would be unavailable due to its similarity to the name of Monty Python star Eric Idle and chose Billy Idol instead.. BBC. Retrieved 28 October 2014 Idol has claimed in interviews that the name was an inspired response to being described on his school report card as \\"idle\\" by his Chemistry teacher, a subject which he admits he hated and in which he underachieved. In late 1976, he joined the newly formed West London 1960s retro-rock band Chelsea as a guitarist.History of the band 'Chelsea'. http://www.steveharnett.com/Chelsea.html The act's singer/frontman Gene October styled Idol's image, advising him to change his short sighted eye- glasses for contact lenses, and dye his hair blonde with a crew cut for a retro-1950s rocker look. After a few weeks performing with Chelsea, Idol and Tony James, the band's bass guitarist, quit the act and co-founded Generation X, with Idol switching from guitarist to the role of singer/frontman. Generation X was one of the first punk bands to appear on the BBC Television music programme Top of the Pops. Although a punk rock band, they were inspired by mid-1960s British pop, in sharp contrast to their more militant peers, with Idol stating; \\"We were saying the opposite to the Clash and the Pistols. They were singing 'No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones', but we were honest about what we liked. The truth was we were all building our music on the Beatles and the Stones\\". Generation X signed with Chrysalis Records and released three albums and performed in the 1980 film D.O.A., then disbanded. 1981‚Äì1985: Solo career and breakthrough Idol moved to New York City in 1981 and became a solo artist, working with former Kiss manager Bill Aucoin.

Idol's solo career began with the Chrysalis Records EP titled Don't Stop in 1981, which included the Generation X song \\"Dancing with Myself\\", originally recorded for their last album Kiss Me Deadly, and a cover of Tommy James & the Shondells' song \\"Mony Mony\\".

The motorcyle smashing through the church window stunt was carried out by John Wilson, a London motorcycle courier. In 1983, Idol's label released \\"Dancing with Myself\\" in the US in conjunction with a music video directed by Tobe Hooper, which played on MTV for six months. Rebel Yell (1983), Idol's second LP, was a major success and established Idol in the United States with hits such as \\"Rebel Yell,\\" \\"Eyes Without a Face,\\" and \\"Flesh for Fantasy\\". \\"Eyes Without a Face\\" peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100, and \\"Rebel Yell\\" reached number six in the UK Singles Chart.Whitburn, Joel (2006).

Life Couturier was born in the town of Chemill√©-sur-D√™me, Indre- et-Loire, in 1817. As a young boy he felt called to serve as a Catholic priest and was educated at the minor seminary of Combr√©e in Anjou and at the major seminary of Angers, after which he was ordained a priest on 12 March 1842. After teaching history at Combr√©e from 1836 to 1854, he entered the Benedictine Monastery of Saint-Pierre at Solesmes, then newly restored by Abbot Prosper Gu√©ranger, O.S.B. Gu√©ranger appointed Couturier Master of novices one month after his religious profession in 1855, and towards the end of 1861 appointed him prior of the monastery. On the death of Gu√©ranger, Couturier was unanimously elected to succeed him as abbot (11 February 1875). Pope Pius IX appointed him consultor of the Sacred Congregation of the Index, and granted him and his successors the privilege of wearing the cappa magna. Couturier and his monks were forcibly expelled from their monastery by the government, on 6 November 1880, under the anti-clerical laws of the French Third Republic. Later, having attempted to reoccupy it, they were driven out a second time on 29 March 1882. During the remainder of Couturier's life the community lived in three separate houses in the town of Solesmes, using the parish church of the town as their abbey church. Couturier encouraged writers among his monks, and restored old and deserted monasteries, as well as fostering the foundations made by Gu√©ranger. On 28 March 1876, he raised the Priory of St. Mary Magdalene at Marseilles to the dignity of an abbey; in 1880 he restored and repeopled the Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos in Spain; in July, 1889, he established the Priory of Saint-Paul at Wisques, in the Diocese of Arras; and on 15 September 1890, shortly before his death, he reopened the ancient Abbey of Glanfeuil in the Diocese of Angers, deserted since the French Revolution. Works Couturier's literary labours were chiefly his collaboration in the publication of Les Actes des martyrs, a French translation of the Acts of the martyrs from the beginning of the Christian era to our times. The third edition of the work appeared in four volumes (Paris, 1900).

It is also the seat of the Islamic and Cultural Centre of Belgium. The original building was built by architect Ernest Van Humbeeck in an Arabic style, to form the Oriental Pavilion of the National Exhibition in Brussels in 1880. At that time the pavilion housed a monumental painting on canvas: ‚ÄúPanorama of Cairo‚Äù, by the Belgian painter Emile Wauters, which enjoyed major success. However, lack of maintenance in the twentieth century caused the building to gradually deteriorate. In 1967, King Baudouin lent the building to King Faisal ibn Abd al-Aziz of Saudi Arabia with a 99-year rent-free lease, on an official visit to Belgium as part of negotiations to secure oil contracts. The building was turned into a place of worship for the use of Muslim immigrants to Belgium, who at the time were notably from Morocco and Turkey. As part of the deal, imams from the Gulf area would be hired, although their orthodox salafism was a tradition, according to Georges Dallemagne, different from that of the more open-minded immigrants but their teachings would over time turn them into a more orthodox tradition and imams would discourage immigrants from integrating into the Belgian society, according to Georges Dallemagne. The mosque, after a long reconstruction carried out at the expense of Saudi Arabia by Tunisian architect Mongi Boubaker, was inaugurated in 1978 in the presence of Khalid ibn Abd al-Aziz and Baudouin.Martin Dunford, Phil Lee. The Rough Guide to Brussels. Penguin, 2009. p.114 The Mosque's role as the leading religious institution within the Belgian Islamic community‚Äîas well as its intended role as a diplomatic bridge between the Saudi and Belgian monarchies‚Äîhas been a point of debate since its re-foundation. Ural Man√ßo. Voix et voies musulmanes de Belgique. Volume 43 of Publications des Facult√©s universitaires Saint-Louis: Travaux et recherches, 2000. pp.87-102 The mosque is popular with Muslim diplomats and is a popular location for Belgians seeking to convert to Islam. It has also taught thousands of Muslim students. Imams and officials have come out to repeat the message that Islam is a religion of peace and has nothing to do with the terrorists in the aftermath of the November 2015 Paris attacks. The ICC's director Khalid Alabri who propagated the Takfiri dogma was expelled by Belgian authorities for his extreme views in 2012. In October 2017 the Belgian minister of asylum and migration Theo Francken revoked the residence permit of the Egyptian-trained imam of the mosque, Abdelhadi Sewif. Francken cited his salafist ideology, his conservative stance and the imam being a danger to Belgian society and national security as reasons for the revocation. Sewif denied any connection with extremism and appealed to the country‚Äôs highest migration authority, but Belgium‚Äôs deputy premier, Jan Jambon, has shot down his chance of a successful appeal. A public commission investigating the 2016 Brussels bombings found that 9 participants of courses at the mosque had joined the ranks of foreign fighters of radical groups in the Middle East. Due to these findings, the commission recommended in October 2017 that Saudi control of the mosque be annulled. The commission also stated that the salafi and wahhabist doctrine of the mosque were antithetical to a liberal Islam compatible with European society. While the mosque leadership claims to promote an inclusionist vision of Islam, Belgian authorities state that the mosque encourage worshippers to close themselves off from mainstream Belgian society and that lead imam Abdelhadi Sewif spoke neither French nor Dutch, official languages of Belgium. Organization By decree signed by Belgian education minister Andr√© Bertouille in 1983 the mosque is under the control of the Muslim World League which then received three positions on its board of directors. The mosque is also financed by the Muslim World League, which in turn is financed by the government of Saudi Arabia. The Islamic Cultural Center hosts a school and an Islamic research centre whose objectives are to propagate the Muslim faith. The prayers are in Arabic. The centre also provides courses of Arabic for adults and children, as well as introductory courses in Islam. Belgian parliamentarian Willy Demeyer has criticised the mosque‚Äôs organisation as outdated: ‚ÄúToday, Muslims are present in every district of Belgium and the vast majority of them wish to live out their beliefs in peace ‚Äì it is to them that we should be handing over the most representative place of Belgian Islam....‚Äù Saudi Arabia relinquishing control In February 2018 Saudi Arabia agreed to give up control of the mosque in a sign that it is trying to shed its reputation as a global exporter of an ultra-conservative brand of Islam. On 16 March 2018, the Council of Ministers of Belgium decided to end the concession and transfer its exploitation to the Muslim Executive of Belgium and a charity of local believers. A transition period of one year was decided, enabling to create a structure that will associate the Muslim Executive and the yet to form association. The government thus enacts a recommendation of the commission investigating the 2016 Brussels bombings that aimed at ending interference of foreign states in the Islam taught in Belgium.

Description and history The town of Stoughton was incorporated in 1726 out of Dorchester. Its southern part was established as a separate precinct, which was incorporated as Stoughtonham in 1765 and renamed Sharon in 1783. Sharon Center arose in 1740, around where the precinct's first colonial meeting house was built, now the site of the 1842 Greek Revival Unitarian Church. The only significant surviving pre-20th century landscape in the center is now the single block of North Main Street between Post Office Square and School Street. Included in this area are six houses and two churches, as well as the town library, the district's only civic building. It is a modest Georgian Revival building, constructed in 1914 with funding support from philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. The oldest building in the district is the Dennett House, dating to about 1753. It was built as a replacement for the first parsonage house, which was destroyed by fire, and stands at the northwestern corner of the district. Between it and the Unitarian Church stand three houses: one is the First Congregational Church Parsonage, a Colonial Revival structure built in 1905, while another is the Dr. Griffin Office, also built as a private residence in 1905. To its south is the 1805 Morse House, the first brick building to be built in the town. Opposite the Morse House stands the 1839 Greek Revival First Congregational Church, with the library just to its south.

The specific epithet, senegalensis, translates to mean \\"of Senegal\\", the country where the type specimen was collected. A traditional food plant in Africa, the fruits of A. senegalensis have the potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable land care. Well known where it grows naturally, it is largely unheard of elsewhere. Description Annona senegalensis takes the form of either a shrub or small tree, growing between two and six meters tall. Occasionally, it may become as tall as 11 m. *It has bark of smooth or coarse texture, that can be a gray- silver or gray-brown. It is leaf-scarred, with nearly round flaking, showing lighter-hued spaces of under bark. *Branches have thick, gray, brown or yellow tomentum when new, but this is later shed with age. *Its green to blue-green leaves are alternate, simple, oblong to ovate to elliptic, from 6‚Äì18.5 long by 2.5‚Äì11.5 cm wide, with upper sides nearly hairless, but often hairy on the undersides, green to reddish, aracnose veins on both surfaces, with rounded to slightly notched apices. The leaf base is squared or barely lobeliar. The leaf margin is entire. Stout petioles are 0.5‚Äì2.5 cm long. *Flowers mature to up to 3 cm in diameter, on 2 cm stalks, either singular, or two to four, ascending from the leaf axils. Six thick, creamy or xanthate petals display in double whorls, and green on the outside, but either creamy or sanguine within; each is roughly , hairless or somewhat fuzzy. Petals' inner whorls curve over its stamens and ovary, three loose sepals are ovalish, and smaller than the petals (3‚Äì4 by 4‚Äì5 mm). The stamens range from long. The plant flowers from approximately April through June. *Its pollen is shed as permanent tetrads.Walker JW (1971) Pollen Morphology, Phytogeography, and Phylogeny of the Annonaceae. Contributions from the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University, 202: 1-130. *Fruits are formed of numerous fused, fleshy, bumpy, ovaform or globular carpels about . They are green when young, ripening to yellow, and eventually to orange, packed with many burnt-orange-colored, oblong, cylindrical seeds. The fruit stalk is long. A. senegalensis is generally pollinated by several species of beetle, but can be hand pollinated when grown as a crop plant. Its seed viability usually lasts no more than six months. Habitat A. senegalensis tends to grow in semiarid to subhumid regions adjacent to the coast, often, but not exclusively, on coral-based rocks with mostly sandy, loamy soils, from sea level up to 2400 meters, at mean temperatures between 17 and 30 ¬∞C, and mean rainfall between . They are often solitary plants within woodland savannah understory, also frequently in swamp forests, or riverbanks, or on former cropland left fallow for an extended period. Distribution It is native to tropical east and northeast, west and west-central, and southern Africa, as well as southern subtropical Africa, and islands in the western Indian Ocean. Specific to the nation of South Africa, it is found in KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, and Mpumalanga. A. senegalensis has become naturalized in parts of India. It is also found in the islands of Maldives. Uses The primary use of this versatile plant is for food, but it has applications in numerous aspects of human endeavor, and every part of the plant has unique properties and uses. The flowers, leaves and fruit are edible and culinary: white fruit pulp has a mild, pineapple-like flavor. Flowers are added to spice or garnish meals; leaves are eaten by humans as vegetables, or grazed by livestock. Leaves are also part of the diet of the West African giraffe. The leaves are also used to create a general health tonic, in the treatment of pneumonia, and as mattress and pillow stuffing. Specific to Sudan, leaves are boiled in the making of perfume. Bark can be processed to produce yellow-brown dye, insecticide, or medicine for treating a wide array of ailments, including worms parasitic on the intestines or flesh (notably guinea worms), diarrhea, gastroenteritis, lung infections, toothaches, and even snakebites. Natural gum in the bark is used to close open wounds. Roots are also used medicinally in treating a gamut of conditions, from dizziness and indigestion to chest colds to venereal diseases. Suckering shoots provide binding fibers, and the malleable, pale brown to white wood is used to carve tool handles, or fashioned into poles. Wood ash is an admixture to chewing tobacco and snuff, and also in soap production as solvent. The essential oils in the fruits and leaves are valued for their organic chemical constituents: car-3-ene (in fruit) and linalool (from leaves). Certain parts of A. senegalensis are used in treating skin or eye disorders. Many South Africans believe the roots can cure insanity. Some Mozambicans feed them to infants to wean them from their mother's breast. Anthracnose Like other species within the genus Anonna, A. senegalensis is commonly afflicted by anthracnose, brought on by the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum gloesporioides, which leads to leaf drop, eventually followed by mummification of its fruit. Controls often employed against the disease include spray applications of fermate or phygon.

He introduced the filesystem as a public replacement for his Tux2 filesystem which had encountered licensing issues due to the filing of several patents. Phillips had previously created the Htree directory indexing system which eventually became an official feature of ext3. The technical details of Tux3 were first publicized in an email on 23 July 2008. Design In broad outline, Tux3 follows a conventional Unix-style inode/file/directory design. A Tux3 inode table is a B-tree with versioned attributes at the leaves. A file is an inode attribute that is a B-tree with versioned extents at the leaves. Directory indexes are mapped into directory file blocks as with Htree. Free space is mapped by a B-tree with extents at the leaves. It attempts to avoid traditional journaling by introducing a recovery logic which allows it to recover upon remounting. A Tux3 inode is a variable sized object consisting of a list of attributes, each labeled by the version at which the attribute was added, changed or removed. The B-tree index by which inodes are referenced is not versioned. The B-tree index of a large file is also not versioned, except for the leaves of the index, which contain lists of extents, each labeled by the version at which the referenced file data was added or changed. This style of versioning is essentially the inverse of tree versioning methods used by Write Anywhere File Layout (WAFL), ZFS and Btrfs, where multiple tree roots of an entire filesystem are created in order to express differences between versions of the filesystem. A claimed advantage of Tux3 style versioned entities is that only a few bytes need to be added to represent single changes to inode attributes or to index new versions of file data blocks, compared to some number of index blocks needing to be allocated and written for tree- versioned filesystems.  Development history  As of August 2008, Tux3 was only capable of performing basic file I/O on files. By the end of 2008, Tux3 was capable of running within the kernel and able to sustain repeated runs of the file system exerciser fsx-linux, a big accomplishment. On 17 February 2009, Linux booted from a Tux3 root filesystem for the first time. On 18 January 2013, initial fsck support was added. So far it just checks physical referential integrity, but the developers are confident that they can make a fully functional e2fsck-quality fsck soon. On 17 May 2014, Daniel Phillips made a plea to the kernel maintainer, to review the code and implement it into the kernel. The goal is to stabilize the code in the kernel and finally get stable.http://heise.de/-2193115 On 9 October 2017, Daniel Phillips sent Tux3 update - Shardmap on the mailing list.

It consists of the large group of 18th to 21st century agricultural and estate properties with farmland, gardens, residences, and landscapes of the Hunnewell and Welles families. The properties in the Historic District are still largely owned and occupied by members of the Hunnewell family. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.Arnoldia issue 64/4 - Hunnewell Estates . accessed 5.15.2011 All of the properties within the district are private residences, and are not open to the public. History Topiary 'Italian Garden' on the H.H. Hunnewell estate circa 1909. The origin of the Hunnewell estates dates to 1763 when Samuel Welles (1725-1799) made his first purchase of Indian lands in Natick and West Needham (later Wellesley). Welles was a descendant of Thomas Welles (1594-1660), 1st Treasurer and then Governor of the Colony of Connecticut. The properties descended to Samuel's granddaughter Isabella Pratt Welles and her husband, successful railroad financier and businessman, landscape designer, and horticulturalist H. Hollis Hunnewell (1810-1902), and continued with their adult children and the following generations.Arnoldia vol.12, issue 9-12; Dec. 1952 - \\"The Hunnewell Arboretum, 1852 - 1952\\" . accessed 5.15.2011 Mr. Hunnewell and his family gave much to the town of Wellesley (formerly West Needham), which was named after his wife's family - the Welles, and to Boston, with civic philanthropy in numerous fields. They also were generous to the New England horticulture community for over 75 years via importing, testing, and distributing many new plant introductions, estate site planning and garden design examples, and supportive leadership in the Massachusetts Horticultural Society. Horatio Hollis Hunnewell was especially interested in coniferous and broad-leaved evergreens, and Asian rhododendrons. At their peak during the early 20th century 'American Country Place' era, there were twenty contiguous Hunnewell estates along Washington Street and Pond Road in southwest Wellesley. The estates have now been in the Welles-Hunnewell family for eight generations. Conservation The family has placed hundreds of acres in the district under perpetual conservation restrictions, primarily with The Trustees of Reservations, protecting Lake Waban and the Charles River, as well as the farmland, gardens, landscapes, vistas, and natural native landscapes from development. These restrictions, starting in 1974, were among the first placed with the Trustees of Reservations. None of the properties are open to the public. However, while maintaining its property rights in this regard, the family has traditionally allowed members of the neighboring Wellesley College community to enter the properties to walk the private path around Lake Waban. However, consistent with the closure of the Wellesley College campus to the public in March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the lakeside path on the properties was also closed until further notice. Historic district The district includes the original Welles homestead, the Hunnewell Farm, and the eight contiguous country houses and outbuildings H. H. Hunnewell built for himself and seven of his nine children: *\\"Welles House\\" (1770) - Colonial style original country homestead of the Welles family of Boston and Paris. *\\"H. H. Hunnewell estate\\" (1851) - Italianate style residence of H. H. Hunnewell (1810-1902) and his wife Isabella Pratt Welles, designed by Arthur Gilman, and including renowned lakeside Italian Garden (1854), the first topiary garden in the United States , and Pinetum (1867). In 1865-1866, two gate lodges were built and a large conservatory was added to the residence, all designed by Gridley J.F. Bryant. In addition to these and other outbuildings, the estate includes the 1755 house of Captain Aaron Smith, who led a company of 70 Minutemen to the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Mr. Hunnewell was his own landscape architect and did not employ a professional firm to lay out his grounds; his original design is essentially completely intact. *\\"The Cottage\\" (1870) - Queen Anne style guest cottage, designed by John Sturgis, and including 1923 landscape design by the Olmsted Brothers. *\\"The Oaks\\" (1871) - residence of Arthur Hunnewell (1845-1904), designed by John Sturgis, burned in 1891, and replaced with a new residence designed by Shaw & Hunnewell, with first private golf course in New England (1892), in use until World War II. *\\"Walter Hunnewell House\\" (1875) - Stick style residence of Walter Hunnewell (1844-1921), designed by Ware & Van Brunt and including many of the same elements as their design for Memorial Hall at Harvard, which was designed and built contemporaneously.

The group describes itself as \\"undogmatic and pragmatic\\" and generally takes moderately liberal economic positions. It was founded in September 1974. One of the prominent founding members is Gesine Schwan, a former SPD candidate for the German Presidency. The group is led by Petra Ernstberger, Carsten Schneider, and Johannes Kahrs. The Circle is named after its long-standing meeting place, Seeheim (Bergstra√üe), just south of Frankfurt.  History  In the 1950s, a group of conservative or traditional members of the SPD met regularly in an informal group known as the Kanalarbeiter (Canal Workers). They were considered to be one of the most influential groups within the larger Social Democratic Party. The most prominent members of the Canal Workers were Egon Franke and Annemarie Renger. Annemarie Renger's membership shows that the lineage of the national wing of the Social Democrats goes even further back in history, as Renger's former employer was Kurt Schumacher, who through his Doctoral Advisor Johann Plenge could claim a connection all the way to the Lensch-Cunow-Haenisch group, established during the First World War. Parallel to the development of the Canal Workers, starting in 1969 an additional conservative grouping within the SPD was initiated by G√ºnther Metzger, known as the Metzger Circle, which soon developed in 1972 into the Arbeitskreis Linke Mitte (Centre Left Work Circle), which can be considered the forerunner of today's Seeheim Circle. In the course of the late 1960s leftward shift of the Jusos, the youth organization of the Social Democrats, the left wing of the SPD increased in influence and numbers. A meeting in the Dorint-Hotel in Lahnstein in December 1974 is considered to be the official founding of the Seeheim Circle; however, already in 1973 a group of around 40 Social Democrats met at the invitation of Hans-Jochen Vogel to discuss a way to come out of the \\"theoretical and ideological defensive\\" posed by the left wing of the party. Other founding members include Richard L√∂wenthal and Gesine Schwan. Though the Seeheim Circle ended up not accomplishing their initially stated goal of serving as a provocative ideological counterweight within the Party, they experienced early successes in gaining influence in SPD staffing policy and in pushing through broader Social Democratic Party decisions. The early Seeheimers followed in the footsteps of the Canal Workers, whose motto was \\"nothing happens without us\\". From 1978 to 1984, the group, which was also known as the Lahnstein Circle, met in the Lufthansa Training Center in Seeheim on the Bergstra√üe, the origin of the name \\"Seeheimers.\\" Between 1974 and 1982 Chancellor Helmut Schmidt included several Seeheimers in his Cabinet, who had supported him during the debates in the party about the industrial use of nuclear energy and the NATO Double-Track Decision. After the end of the Helmut Schmidt Era, the Kanalarbeiter, who had represented the interests of traditional, non- intellectual union workers, definitively merged with the Seeheim Circle, which in contrast was considered to be \\"intellectual.\\" During conflicts during the 1980s within the Social Democrats about the direction of the party, the Seeheim Circle opposed the alliance between the Social Democrats and Alliance '90/The Greens. The Seeheimers also distinguished themselves during this period from other currents within the SPD by supporting reunification with East Germany as a political goal. After reunification with East Germany in 1990, the Seeheimers added two prominent Social Democrats from the former GDR to their ranks, Stephan Hilsberg and Markus Meckel. During the 1998‚Äì2005 chancellorship of Gerhard Schr√∂der, the Seeheimers supported his changes to social services.  Personnel  The Circle is led by Siemtje M√∂ller, Dirk Wiese, and Dagmar Ziegler. Other leading members of the Seeheimer are Doris Barnett, Fritz-Rudolf K√∂rper, Edgar Franke, Sport Committee Chairwoman Dagmar Freitag, Carsten Schneider, who belong to a group known as the Sprecherkreis. Members of the advisory board for the Seeheimer include Sigmar Gabriel and Ulla Schmidt. Previous members have included Rolf Schwanitz and Wolfgang Tiefensee.  Political views  The Seeheim Circle focuses on pragmatic solutions in social policy, financial policy, and economic policy. The party strives to align social welfare with financial possibilities, a commitment to give and take in social welfare, a reduction of the national debt, the necessity of reforms through pragmatic handling, and an open minded relationship to globalization. Moreover, the Seeheim Circle views demographic change as a central policy field and is ready to take social policy in directions which could lie outside of Social Democratic tradition. However, this readiness for innovation would not contradict the Party Program of the Social Democrats.

Born in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, on September 28, 1961, Kevin Ward was the youngest of four children to parents Robert and Paula. Ward was raised in Chalfont and attended Central Bucks High School West in Doylestown, where he was an American football quarterback and baseball pitcher. He played football and baseball at the University of Arizona from 1979 to 1983. Ward's first year of college football was played under coach Tony Mason. In his sophomore season, Ward started three games at quarterback for coach Larry Smith before Smith moved Ward to receiver. Ward played collegiate baseball under coach Jerry Kindall between 1981 and 1983. In 1982, Ward hit for a .403 batting average, 46 runs batted in, and fourteen stolen bases. All three were team-leading totals, and Ward was named to the All-Pac-10 South team. After the 1982 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Ward was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies in the sixth round of the 1983 Major League Baseball draft. He spent time the Oakland Athletics organization before making his major league debut with the San Diego Padres in 1991. Over two seasons with the team, Ward played in a total of 125 games, and hit for a .217 average, with five career home runs alongside twenty runs batted in. High School career Kevin ward excelled as a starting quarterback for CB West. Running an option play, Ward ran for 98 yards against Coatsville during a game in the 1977 season. While in high school Ward played baseball and football, and one year of baseball as a sophomore. Ward finished his high school career with a 21-1 record as quarterback, going 11-0 during his senior year and was a third team all-state selection at quarterback. Future NFL star Dan Marino was the first team selection. His stand out career led to his recruitment at Arizona where he was a two-sport star for the Wildcats. Pro career Kevin Ward made his professional debut with the Bend Phillies of the Northwest League in 1981. Ward led the team with a .307 batting average, as well as lead the team in hit by pitch with four. The following season was spent in a higher class of A ball, as ward played for the Peninsula Pilots of the Carolina League. While Ward's batting average dipped against a higher level of competition, he did find his power, belting 13 home runs, second on the team to Randy Day. The following season, Ward again moved up the chain, playing double A ball for the Reading Phillies. Appearing in 43 games that season, ward belted 21 home runs and hit over three hundred again, finishing the season with a .303 batting average. He played the following season at Reading as well. His manager that season at Reading was George Culver,a journeyman ex major league pitcher who the previous season had been Ward's teammate. Playing time increased as war played in 119 games that season, but his home run and batting averages dipped. However, the Phillies thought highly enough of Ward that they promoted him to the Maine Guides, their Triple A club in 1988. Ward was part of an outfield that also included two other Phillies prospects, Ron Jones and Jim Orlander. While Ward was steady in the field, he hit 11 home runs and batted .230. At the end of the 1988 season, Ward became a free agent and signed a contract with the Oakland A's, for whom he played two minor league seasons in their farm system, starting at double A- hunstville and finally Triple A Tacoma. He was granted free agency at the end of the 1990 and signed with the San Diego Padres before spring training in 1991. After a long struggle in the minor leagues, Kevin Ward finally made his major league debut on May 10, 1991. Ward batted sixth in the line up, right after power hitting Fred McGriff, who batted fifth. In the bottom of the second, facing Expos pitcher Brian Barnes, ward got a hit in his first at bat, a double that drove in McGriff. Ward faced Barry Jones in the seventh when Jones was called for a balk. The bases were loaded, so the balk forced Bip Roberts home and advanced the runners. However, Montreal held on for the 6-4 win. On August 26, 1991, the San Diego Padres were playing the Pittsburgh Pirates. San Diego led off the second inning, and Ward was facing Pirates pitcher Randy Tomlin. Facing a 3-2 count, Ward hit a deep fly to center field that turned into Ward's first home run in the major leagues. Ward's homer made it 2-1 Padres, and they went on to win 7-5. Ward would hit his second homer of the season the very next game, off Pirates pitcher Zane Smith in the seventh inning. The Pirates ended up winning the game 5-2. The home runs against the Pirates were Ward's only long balls of the season. Another highlight of the 1991 season was a series the Padres played in Philadelphia. Not only was it special because it was Philadelphia that he'd been drafted by to start his pro career, but it was also the first time that his parents got to see him play professional baseball. Ward turned 30 in 1992, and spent the season as a reserve outfielder for San Diego. 1992 was Ward's second and final season in the majors. In 1993, he signed with the expansion Colorado Rockies and played for their Triple A team, the Colorado City Sky Sox. Ward retired from baseball after that season. Death Ward was diagnosed with brain cancer in December 2018, and died of the disease on March 9, 2019, aged 57. He was married to Christy, with whom he had two children.

When the company was based in Michigan it was a major producer of carburetors for many Detroit-built automobiles. Later they manufactured carburetors for both street and racing applications such as the Holley \\"Double Pumper\\" and \\"Dominator\\". Holley-style carburetors have powered every NASCAR Sprint Cup team and every NHRA Pro Stock champion until both series eventually switched to electronic fuel injection. NASCAR Sprint Cup engines still utilize a Holley throttle body and Holley EFI is the spec EFI system in NHRA Pro Stock. Holley's product range has expanded to include the aforementioned fuel injection systems, performance fuel pumps, intake manifolds, superchargers, nitrous oxide injection, performance plumbing parts, exhaust systems, engine dress‚Äìup products, ignition products, datalogging & display products, handheld programmers, bellhousings, and clutches for street performance, race, and marine applications. Among the company's owned divisions are brand names MSD Performance, Nitrous Oxide Systems (NOS), Weiand, Flowtech, Earl's Performance Plumbing, Hooker Headers, Demon Carburetion, Racepak, Superchips, Diablosport, Edge Products, Accel Ignition, Quick Time, Hays Clutches, Mr. Gasket, Lakewood, and Mallory Ignition. History Holley Brothers Company advertisement for carburetors in the Automobile Trade Journal, 1916. Holley began in Bradford, Pennsylvania in 1896 when brothers George (1878-1963) and Earl Holley started a company to produce a small one-cylinder three-wheeled vehicle they dubbed the \\"Runabout\\", with a top speed of 30 mph. At the eve of the era of motorcars, the brothers decided to start the Holley Motor Company, and produced one four-wheeled model: \\"The Holley brothers built their first marketable automobile in 1902. They called it the Holley Motorette and it sold for $550. More than 600 were produced.\\" \\"Their first original carburetor, called the iron pot, appeared on the curved- dash Oldsmobile in 1904.\\" Mike Urich, Bill Fisher, Holley carburetors, manifolds & fuel injection: how to select, install, tune, repair, and modify Holley fuel system components for street and racing use, Page 6, Penguin, 1994. In April 1905 Holley Brothers Company was established with an address at 661-75 Beaubien St., Detroit, Michigan.International Motor Cyclopaedia, Year Book-March 1908 to March 1909, Page 241, Publisher: E.E. Schwarzkopf, New York. The brothers then concentrated on the manufacturing of carburetors and ignition systems. As a result of the Motorette Henry Ford commissioned the brothers to produce a carburetor for his Model T. \\"The carburetor they built for Ford was an immediate success and the brothers founded Holley Carburetor Co., which became one of Ford's biggest suppliers.\\" Plain Dealer, December 7, 1958, Page 25. In 1913 George Holley made a tour of Germany to study manufacturing methods, accompanied by Henry M. Leland, when it was said that a Holley carburetor: \\"was on more than one-half of the automobiles sent out from American factories this year.\\" Oregonian, July 13, 1913, Section 4, Page 4. In 1925 a Holley employee, Daniel H. Meloche, was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal by the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia. He had invented an improved refractory coating for casting molds, allowing permanent iron molds to make gray iron castings over many cycles, whereas earlier iron molds were quickly consumed when casting iron. The process employing long-life molds was leased to the River Rouge plant of the Ford Motor Company, the Harrison Radiator Corporation, and the plant of Ludwig, Loewe & Co., of Berlin.Seattle Daily Times, May 17, 1925, Page 30. In 1929 the Los Angeles Times reported that George M. Holley of Pasadena and Detroit and a director of the Aviation Corporation of Delaware, has been elected a director of the Bach Aircraft Corporation. Holley, while serving as president of the Holley Carburetor Company, was also a director of National Air Transport, Kinner Airplane and Motor, Stinson Aircraft of Detroit, Air Investors Inc., Towie Aircraft Company of Detroit, and one of the original stockholders of Western Air Express Inc.Los Angeles Times, March 21, 1929, Page 14. In 1931 Holley became a director of the Warner Aircraft Corporation.Wall Street Journal, March 20, 1931, Page 7. In 1952 Holley closed a plant at Portland, Michigan, which moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky.Plain Dealer, March 12, 1953, Page 13. That year Holley produced the Visi-flo carburetor, with a glass inspection window to make a visual check of the fuel level, sediment, flooding and float action. The glass fuel bowl was manufactured by the Lancaster Lens company of Lancaster, Ohio.Chicago Daily Tribune, September 7, 1952, Page A6. In 1955 the Wall Street Journal reported: \\"Bowling Green Manufacturing Co., a subsidiary of Holley Carburetor Co., each year sends its employes dummy \\"checks\\" made out for the amount each employee has received indirectly through fringe benefits.\\" \\"Fringe Binge: Unions Set to Push For a Big Expansion of Non-Wage Benefits,\\" Wall Street Journal, February 10, 1955, Page 4. In 1968 the Plain Dealer reported: \\"Colt Industries Inc. has acquired Holley Carburetor Co., of Warren, Michigan, following approval by directors of both companies. Holley Carburetor which makes auto ignition systems and aviation fuel controls, employs about 3,000 at four facilities in three states.\\" Plain Dealer, February 11, 1968, Page 50. At this time the corporate, engineering and sales headquarters were in Warren, with plants in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Paris, Tennessee and Clare, Michigan.Colt Industries Annual Report, 1967, Page 3. Holley was said to have a turnover of $40 million in 1967. At the time of the sale the company was primarily owned by members of the Holley family.Wall Street Journal, February 7, 1968, Page 21. In 1974 Holley was making carburetors for Ford and some under its own name at Paris, Tennessee.Mobile Register, June 28, 1974, Page 7. \\"Significant facilities expansions were initiated in 1979 at Water Valley, Mississippi to meet carburetor requirements for the new Ford Motor Company four-cylinder car, code named Erika, and in Bowling Green, Kentucky; Paris, Tennessee and Sallisaw, Oklahoma.\\" Colt Industries Annual Report, 1979, Page 12.

These functions were moved to Bowling Green, Kentucky.Wall Street Journal, September 10, 1993, Page B4. Holley continued its dominance in racing, powering all winning NHRA Pro Stock racers and all NASCAR Sprint Cup Series‚Ñ¢ teams. The 1980s also saw Holley's entrance into the fuel injection market where OEM EFI components and analog Pro-Jection¬Æ retrofit fuel-injection systems for carbureted cars were introduced. In the early 1990s Holley continued new product introductions with the HP Pro Series race-ready carburetors. During this time Holley also introduced SysteMAX¬Æ engine kits that included matched cylinder heads, intakes and cams. The Dominator also evolved in the 1990s into the HP Dominator; huge billet electric fuel pumps were introduced, and retrofit EFI kits evolved into digital Pro-Jection 4D and 4Di. In 1998 Coltec Industries sold Holley Performance for $100 million to a management-led team backed by Kohlberg & Co., L.L.C. New York Times, April 15, 1998, Page D4. In 1999, after becoming independent of Coltec Industries, the management team purchased a number of other aftermarket companies in an effort to provide a \\"full package\\" to their customers/dealers. These companies include: Weiand (intake manifolds and superchargers), B&M;'s supercharger division, Hooker Headers, Earl's Performance Plumbing, Flow Tech exhaust, Lunati (camshafts, crankshafts, pistons and connecting rods), NOS (Nitrous Oxide Systems, Inc), and So-Cal Speed Shop, as well as a few ancillary companies.

The song \\"The Landlord is Dead\\" from Goodbye Enemy Airship the Landlord Is Dead and \\"Chinatown\\" from & Yet & Yet are also featured in the movie A Simple Curve. The band's fifth full-length album, entitled You, You're a History in Rust, was released on Constellation Records in February 2007. The band toured North America and Europe to promote the release of the album, and released a tour EP, The Whole Story of Glory, to promote the Japanese leg of their tour. In June 2009 at Luminato, Toronto's annual festival of arts and creativity, the band provided part of the live soundtrack for the outdoor screening (at Yonge- Dundas Square) of the 1919 silent German horror film Tales Of The Uncanny (Unheimliche Geschichten), alongside Canadian violinist Owen Pallett and electronica music artist Robert Lippok from Berlin, Germany.

The core of the camp ground was purchased in 1863 by the Sandwich District Camp Meeting Association, a Methodist Episcopal organization, and was operated until 1939. The area contains a well-preserved collection of predominantly residential buildings built during this period; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history Early image of a family in front of their tent at Yarmouth Camp Ground The Yarmouth Camp Ground is located in western Yarmouth and eastern Barnstable. It is located south of the mid-Cape Highway (Massachusetts Route 6), and is roughly bounded by County Ave., Willow St., Wood Rd., and Camp Ground Pond. Although Methodist Episcopalians had been holding camp meetings on Cape Cod since 1819, an earlier site in Eastham was logistically difficult to reach. This site was chosen in 1862, in part due to its proximity to the Yarmouth Depot, a train station just away. The property was at first developed in a somewhat haphazard, evolutionary way, focused on the main tabernacle, in contrast to other, more formally-planned camp meeting sites such as Wesleyan Grove. Over a 25-year period a network of paths and roadways grew, with tents used by early visitors eventually replaced by small Gothic cottages. The site was used for religious summer camps until 1939; in 1946 it was acquired by the Yarmouth Camp Ground Association, a secular organization established to own the area's common land and preserve the character of its buildings. The architecture of the camp ground is typical of other camp meeting sites, predominantly Gothic Revival in character. Typical cottages are 1-1/2 story wood frame buildings with gable roof, having a kitchen and living room below and small bedrooms above. A number of the early cottages have essentially identical dimensions to their core structure, an indication of common plans and construction methods. Many have been altered to some extent, some to the point where the original structure is hard to discern from the numerous additions built around it. Exterior decorative elements include vertical board siding, although unfinished wooden-shingled walls typical of the region are also quite common. Vergeboard \\"gingerbread\\" trim in the eaves and gable ends is also fairly common. There are three notable departures from the cottages in the camp ground. A larger year-round caretaker's house lacking Gothic styling stands at 1 Grove Avenue, and a building used as a retail store stands at 63 Grace Avenue. Johnson Hall, at 69 Center Avenue, then as now houses the organization that oversees the area. The camp ground's tabernacle building, built in 1890, was severely damaged by hurricanes in 1938 and 1944, and was torn down in 1945.

CED-12 is a homolog to the ELMO protein found in mammals. This protein is involved in Rac-GTPase activation, apoptotic cell phagocytosis, cell migration, and cytoskeletal rearrangements. Discovery The discovery of CED-12 was done using knockout experiments. Its involvement in the apoptotic phagocytosis pathway was first noted when knocked-out ced-12 in C. elegans showed similar results in the apoptotic process to ced-5 and ced-2 knockouts. This lead researchers to believe, and later confirm, that the protein products of ced-12 (CED-12), ced-5 (CED-5), and ced-2 (CED-2) all functioned as part of the same pathway. Researchers also noted direct protein- protein interactions between CED-12 and CED-10 (C. elegans homolog for Rac1), a Rac-GTPase (energy-dependent protein found used for cytoskeletal rearrangements among other functions). CED-10 was inactive when CED-12 was knocked-out. Expression of CED-12 with CED-5 and CED-2 activated CED-10, which lead to the activation of apoptotic phagocytosis.  Function  CED-12 is an adaptor protein (proteins involved in facilitating the formation of signalling complexes) that is translated once apoptosis has been triggered in a cell. Apoptosis, also known as programmed cell death, activates during development as well as in situations where a cell has received sufficient physical damage. Many of the contents within a cell are reactive with the environment outside of the cell and must be disposed of without causing any harm to the surrounding tissues. Apoptotic cells are removed from their external environment by neighbouring cells that recognize cell-surface markers located on the apoptotic cell membrane. Marker recognition leads to the engulfment of apoptotic cells by phagocytosis. On a molecular level, recognition of the cell-surface markers leads to the translation of the CED-12 protein in the cytoplasm of the engulfing cell, which then gets localized to the cell membrane. CED-12 binds CED-2 (C. elegans homolog to CrkII in mammals), followed by CED-5 (C. elegans homolog for DOCK180 in mammals) and forms a ternary structure. Transmembrane CED-1 is an example of the cell-surface receptor on the engulfing cell. When receptors come in contact with cell surface markers on the apoptotic cell, a protein known as CED-6 (homolog for GULP in mammals) is expressed. Both the CED-2/CED-5/CED-12 ternary structure and CED-6 function to activate an effector protein known as CED-10. CED-10 is a RAC-GTPase protein that is directly responsible for the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton that initiates phagocytosis. This process is regulated by two pathways. The first is by CED-6, which is an adaptor protein that is responsible for coordinating protein-protein interactions between CED-10 and actin. The second pathway occurs when the CED-2/CED-5/CED-12 ternary structure form a GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) with CED-10, which promotes the binding of a GTP energy molecule in order to activate the GTP-dependent CED-10. CED-12 also functions in cell migration processes, which is regulated by the same interactions as the apoptotic phagocytosis pathway. It functions in distal tip cell migration in gonad development in C. elegans. Distal tip cells are somatic cells located at the tip of developing gonadal arms, and are responsible for the elongation of the gonadal arm as well as controlling mitotic and meiotic cell division of gonadal cells throughout development and adulthood. As C. elegans develops, the distal cells undergo a series of migrations in order to complete morphological changes, which define both gonad shape and size. This process occurs when integrins on the surface of the distal tip cells meet chemoattractants located on the extracellular matrix. The integrins form focal adhesions at the sites of the chemoattractants, which causes the localization of CED-5 to the adhesion points. CED-12 and CED-2 form the GEF-trio with CED-5 and activate the CED-10 Rac-GTPase in order to rearrange the actin cytoskeleton and promote the forward propagation of the distal tip cells. Gene and protein structure thumb(A) A simplified graphical representation of the protein domains for DOCK2 (mammalian homolog to CED-5) and ELMO1 (mammalian homolog for CED-12). On DOCK2/CED-5, the SH3-domain that binds to ELMO1/CED-12 is shown as a blue rectangle. On ELMO1, Proline-Rich regions, indicated by PH, are in light-blue. These indicate the regions in which ELMO1/CED-12 and DOCK2/CED-5 interact when forming a complex.

NOT SHOWN: CrkII/CED-2 in the ternary structure with DOCK2/CED-5 and ELMO1/CED-12 230x230px The ced-12 gene codes for an 82kDa large protein, which spans 731 amino acids in length. It is found on chromosome 2 on the L-arm in Drosophila, and on chromosome I in C. elegans. The protein structure of CED-12 is separated based on its binding domains: * The proline-rich region on CED-12 is a binding site for the C-terminal SH3-binding domain on CED-5/DOCK180. The proline-rich region contains a high concentration of the amino acid Proline, and lies between amino acid residues 711-724. This domain is crucial in the remodelling processes of the cytoskeleton and follows a conserved sequence pattern composed of proline and arbitrary aliphatic (non- polar amino acids with open alkane side chains) residues. The conserved pattern of the sequence allows for hydrophobic and salt-bridge interactions with the SH3-domain. * The repeating Armadillo (ARM) region on the N-terminal binds CED-2/CrkII, which is necessary to activate the heterodimerization with CED-5/DOCK180. *The Pleckstrin Homology domain spans 100-200 amino acids in length.

It encompasses a well-preserved summer resort area for the wealthy that was first developed in the late 19th century, focused around the Wianno Club, built in 1881 on the site of an earlier resort hotel. The district has a significant number of well-preserved Shingle style and Colonial Revival houses. Architect Horace Frazer designed the Wianno Club, as well as a number of the private residences in the district. The district is roughly bounded by East Bay Road, Wianno and Sea View Avenues between Nantucket Sound and Crystal Lake. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history The Wianno area occupies a small portion of the southern coast of Cape Cod in the Osterville section of Barnstable. It includes a series of waterfront properties on Sea View Avenue extending from Warren Street to Wianno Avenue, and extends a short way along Wianno, including a few properties lacking direct access to the water. The central focus of the district is the Wianno Club, a large Shingle/Colonial Revival structure designed by Horace Frazer and built in 1881 to replace the grand c. 1873 Cotocheset House hotel, which had burned down. The colony had been planned in the 1870s by wealthy interests from Boston, New York City, and the local area, which had bought up most of the land on a speculative basis, built the hotel, and sold of parcels for summer houses. The result was a series of handsome \\"cottages\\", large two-story wood-frame structures that are predominantly Shingle style. These houses are typically somewhat rambling in character, often with gambrel roofs, and with porches, projecting gables, and dormers to give visual interest. They are set on larger lots (typically or more). One particularly handsome example of the houses built is the Calvin Prescott House, 550 Wianno Avenue, which was built in 1882-83. It is 2-1/2 stories in height, with a gabled roof pierced by eyebrow windows, corner turret and complex entry pavilion. The Isobel Richards House, 432 Wianno, has Queen Anne features, and has a windmill on the property, one of several found in the district. The Tiffany House, located next to the Wianno Club and now one of its guest houses, was built for a member of Louis Comfort Tiffany's family in 1879.

This hotel was the centerpiece of a major resort development for the wealthy that was mostly developed prior to World War I. In 1916 the newly founded club purchased the hotel property. The club built a nine-hole golf course on the original land purchase now occupied by holes numbered 13-18. The 16th was the first hole, and the Swan residence behind the hole was built as the original clubhouse. Additional land was assembled on the west side of Parker Road and north of West Bay Road and in 1919, Donald Ross was hired to redesign the original nine and to create a new nine.http://www.capecodindiansummer.com/Wianno.html The main clubhouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, as one of a very few surviving 19th-century hotel buildings, and is the centerpiece of the Wianno Historic District. It is a large three-story Shingle style building, with a variety of cross gables, projecting sections and porches typical of the style. A single-story wing was added to the northeast after the club took the building over, and a Colonial Revival porch was added in the 1920s. Its interiors contain much original detail.

The district encompasses the historic heart of the village of West Barnstable. This is a roughly linear district, including all of the properties along Meetinghouse Way between County Road and the 1717 West Parish Meetinghouse, which is the district's most prominent building. Most of the houses in the district were built in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and are thus predominantly in Georgian, Federal, and Greek Revival styles. Later buildings include the First Selectmen's Office (1889), elementary school (1903), and railroad station (1910). The area was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Timeline of West Parish Meetinghouse 1712 ‚Äì By 1712, the Barnstable settlement had grown so large, that the main concern of the annual Town Meeting for several years was the division of the town into two parishes and the building of two Meetinghouses. 1715 ‚Äì A piece of high ground on the land of John Crocker was chosen as the site for the West Parish Meetinghouse. A proprietors meeting was held on April 11, 1715 and Colonel James Otis was the Moderator. Town land was traded, laying out 4 acres ‚Äì three acres for public use (now the Town green below the Meetinghouse) and an additional acre for where the Meetinghouse would be erected. 1717 ‚Äì The town of Barnstable officially voted to divide into an East and a West Parish. The present villages of Osterville and Cotuit were in the West Parish and the villages of Centerville and Hyannis were designated to be in the East Parish. According to records, an order for two precincts was passed on February 7, 1718 and appears in Province Laws, Volume 1X, page 575. 1717 ‚Äì Construction begins on the West Parish Meetinghouse. Records are largely silent on who actually built it or how but the village craftsmen created a structure that later generations of architects and builders continue to marvel at. Nearby great oaks and pines were felled by hand; pine beams, posts and planks were sawed and trimmed over a saw pit dug at the building site; 12 inch square pine timbers were hewn with adzes and raised 48 feet into the air; oak roof buttresses were curved like a ship's frame by hanging them with weights at either end for a year; chamfering, beading and woodworking on the high pulpit and sounding board, panels and sheep pen pews were all done skillfully with simple tools... 1719 ‚Äì Construction took two years to complete and the first service of worship in the West Parish Meetinghouse was held on Thanksgiving Day, 1719. Now completed, the 1717 Meetinghouse not only became the permanent home of the church that gathered 103 years before in England but for the next 130 years was also to be the scene of Barnstable town meetings reflecting the close union of State and Congregational church that existed in early Massachusetts. As years progressed, the Meetinghouse would house the village public school. 1723 ‚Äì Even after only 4 years, the Meetinghouse was deemed too small for its growing congregation and for its secular purposes so was cut in half, the ends pulled apart adding 18 feet of length in the middle. A ceiling exposing only the bottoms of the beams of the Meetinghouse was installed at the same time. A bell tower, one of the earliest in New England was erected. The gilded cock, ordered from England as a weathervane for the Meetinghouse, measures 5 feet, 5 inches from the bill to the tip of the tail and this same \\"Rooster\\" crowns the tower today. 1717 thru 1775 ‚Äì Historians have researched that fifteen years before George Washington was born, the men of Barnstable debated town affairs in the 1717 Meetinghouse. Men who came back from the French and Indian wars recounted their battles. Tories and Patriots argued bitterly. Stormy town meetings, particularly during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 periods, would often necessitate major repairs to the 1717 Meetinghouse interior as receipts for repairs found years later in records indicated. If these walls could talk....what we could learn about the people who lived in this community, worshiped at the Meetinghouse, were schooled in the Meetinghouse or served their community in a civic way at the 1717 Meetinghouse. Famous names of this era included James Otis Jr., Mercy Otis Warren, \\"Mad Jack\\" Percival, Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw, among others. 1806 ‚Äì The half-ton bell was cast by Paul Revere for the Town of Barnstable in 1806. It was given to the church in memory of Colonel James Otis, father of the Patriot. It still summons the West Parish of Barnstable church to worship on Sunday mornings. 1717 thru 1880s ‚Äì the 1717 Meetinghouse as a School: James Otis Jr. (born 2/6/1725) and Mercy Otis (born 9/25/1728) were educated, among many others, in the Meetinghouse. Rebecca Crocker made a pencil drawing in 1851 of the 1717 Meetinghouse while a student and her drawing is the only detailed image in that era of the 1717 Meetinghouse still known to exist. As a means of augmenting his yearly salary of $400, Rev. Henry Goodhue, Pastor of West Parish Church from 1863-1883 established a high school in the upstairs vestry now occupied by the choir. It was the first high school in the Town of Barnstable and was open to all pupils in the town. Affirming the existence of this Barnstable public school were notices in the Hyannis Patriot (now the Barnstable Patriot) in the 1870s: 1852 ‚Äì Some New England parishes demolished their old structures and built new ones when repair costs outweighed budgets. West Parish opted instead to remodel the 1717 Meetinghouse to the neoclassical style favored in the mid-1800s. The old bell tower was torn down, a spire and belfry erected, windows and doors were changed...So much was altered that nothing of the original 1717 Meetinghouse was visible. A century later, however, restoration architects would discover that, underneath it all, the original structure ‚Äì frame, floor, walls and roof ‚Äì remained untouched and intact. Ironically, this option of remodeling instead of tearing it down, unknowingly offered the chance to \\"protect\\" the 1717 Meetinghouse until it could be authentically restored 100 years later in the 1950s. 1871 ‚Äì \\"In the Town Meeting of March 6, 1871: to know if the town will comply with the laws of the State establishing a high school as provided in the second section of Chapter 38 of the General Statutes.\\" And: \\"At a meeting of the school committee of the Town of Barnstable this day holden it was voted that the school taught by Rev. Mr. Goodhue in the vestry of the church at West Barnstable be fixed or designated and established as the school required by the second section‚Ä¶for the benefit of all the inhabitants of said town‚Ä¶ Nathaniel Hinckley, Chairman and Aaron S. Crosby, Secretary.\\" 1874 ‚Äì On this timeline that Elizabeth Crocker Jenkins was born in West Barnstable on November 30, 1874 as the Town high school was underway in the 1717 Meetinghouse as described above. Miss Jenkins would become the driving force behind the restoration of the 1717 Meetinghouse in the 1950s and the incorporation of the West Parish Memorial Foundation. 1837‚Äì1849 ‚Äì The 1717 Meetinghouse ceases to be used for civic meetings: The Massachusetts Legislature passed the Mass Act of Disestablishment in 1831 and it was ratified in 1833 meaning that meetinghouses could no longer be used for both religious and civil affairs. A Town House was built in 1837 for civic meetings on the corner of Oak Street and Old Stage Road. The 1717 Meetinghouse continued to be used for worship services by the church and as the first high school for the Town of Barnstable. After 130 years, the 1717 Meetinghouse ceased to be the scene of the town meetings. Public support of the building was withdrawn sending the Meetinghouse into spiraling disrepair. 1907 ‚Äì M.P. Moller Company from Hagerstown, MD installed a new pipe organ replacing a reed organ. (circa?) 1929 ‚Äì At the annual meeting of the Church, Miss Samuel and Miss Jenkins challenged parishioners to pledge toward a Restoration Fund. Miss Samuel gave the first $25 gift to the Restoration Fund marking the beginning of years of efforts to gather funds and prepare with architects a plan to restore the 1717 Meetinghouse. July 30, 1929 ‚Äì Edwin B. Goodell Jr., leading church architect in America specializing in the Colonial era, began his exploration and investigation of the old \\"Rooster Church.\\" Initial funds in the Restoration Fund had totaled over $400. Miss Elizabeth Crocker Jenkins was appointed Chairman of the Restoration Committee with Elizabeth Samuel and Cora Crocker as her associates. 1935‚Äì1949 ‚Äì Through the Depression years and World War II, Miss Jenkins kept up her resolve to increase the totals in the Restoration Fund. Often she would give tours of the Meetinghouse for a quarter or quietly donate funds bequeathed to her by family to support the Restoration. Appealing to those with interest in preserving the historical and civic aspects of the 1717 Meetinghouse, Miss Jenkins was enlisting the help of Barnstable historian Donald Trayser, philanthropist Charles Ayling, State Senator Edward C. Stone and attorney Henry A. Ellis. 1938 ‚Äì Deterioration continued. The horse sheds alongside the Meetinghouse had fallen into such disrepair that they had to be removed along with the \\"Little House\\" in the back. The Restoration Committee had been growing with the addition of Miss Lillian Arey, Fred Jenkins, Zebrina Jenkins, Victor Leeman, John Makepeace, Charles Makepeace and Bernard Paine. Late 1950 ‚Äì Through the efforts of Deacon Alexander Crane, Mary L. Crocker sold to the Foundation, the land between the Meetinghouse and the Mid-Cape Highway ‚Äì 4.71 acres. The new purchase by the WPMF provided land upon which the present Jenkins Hall was built and where the outdoor chapel was developed. January, 1951 ‚Äì The Restoration Fund totaled $30,601 but it was decided to wait until the fund reached $50,000 before starting the work. 1952 ‚Äì The Parish House (now known as Jenkins Hall) was built. Funds were raised by the Women's Guild through suppers, fairs, and other projects. The Women's Guild, originally chaired by Ruth Gilman, had been formed in 1948 as discussions began about the need for a Parish House where the church could gather while Restoration work was being done on the Meetinghouse and the need for such a Parish House after the restoration was completed. Permission was cordially granted from the Foundation for the building to be erected on the land newly acquired by the Foundation; Restoration architect Goodell gave his services to design the house and builder Forest Brown helped modify the plans to match the funds available. 1953 ‚Äì On May 17, the West Parish of Barnstable made a formal covenant with the West Parish Memorial Foundation giving full and complete permission for the work of the Restoration of the 1717 Meetinghouse to the Foundation and to subsequently see to its proper maintenance... in order that the relationship between West Parish and the Foundation might be clarified. Full text is contained in 1976 and 1988 By-Laws. 1953, Spring ‚Äì Architect Goodell's final plans were approved, nearly half of the $100,000 fund raising goal had been reached; Earle P. Merritt and Charles Ayling were appointed a Building Committee, Rev. Goehring and Deacon Lindsay Armstrong were appointed Parish advisers, Deacon Forest R. Brown was selected as the builder, John Lahteine who would create the complete interior and Charles Hamblin were also on the team. As there were no drawings ever made of the 1717 Meetinghouse, the interior was modeled after the Sandown, NH Meetinghouse. 1955 ‚Äì WPMF commissioned Quentin Munson to build a Communion table for the 1717 Meetinghouse in Deacon Crane's memory. The top was fashioned from two heavy pine planks which were part of the boarding of shipwright Seth Goodspeed's old workshop in Osterville. (page 39, green booklet by Williams) August 24, 1958 ‚Äì The Restoration was finished and a Rededication Service was held. A total of $133,159 was raised and spent on the Restoration of which $18,000 was for materials for the organ. 1960s‚Äì2012 ‚Äì \\"The 1717 Meetinghouse stands today as one of the finest examples of colonial architecture in the country. It is not a museum. It is a memorial to the devotion of the fathers who built it, a testimony to the faithfulness of those who maintained it through the centuries, and a witness to the life of the active church that worships in it today.\\" The 1717 Meetinghouse has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of \\"The West Barnstable Village ‚Äì Meetinghouse Way Historic District.\\" The 1717 Meetinghouse is open to the public in the summer from Memorial Day through Columbus Day from 9am to 4pm for self-guided tours. Guided tours can be arranged by appointment. 2011 ‚Äì Over the years following the restoration, the West Parish Memorial Foundation continues to address the physical needs of the 1717 Meetinghouse ‚Äì everything from exterior painting to security monitoring systems including daily maintenance. 2012 ‚Äì A comprehensive needs assessment plan is in development by the Board of Trustees, as the West Parish Memorial Foundation continues its mission of maintaining and preserving the 1717 Meetinghouse 2013 ‚Äì The Community Preservation Committee of the Town of Barnstable recommends $275,000 be allocated for the restoration of the Revere bell, a new roof, and a fire suppression system. Town Council grants the recommendation. 2013 ‚Äì The Trustees vote to change the name from West Parish Memorial Foundation to the 1717 Meetinghouse Foundation.

Current facilities A TV show being rehearsed in the TV Studio NFTS students still use the original 1930s sound stage and 1960s TV studio building, but other buildings have been constructed on site to improve teaching facilities. Recent expansion To modernise and expand the teaching and administrative space, the NFTS commissioned Glen Howells Architects to design a three-storey building (see photo). Upon its completion in 2008 it won a RIBA prize. In June 2009 it was formally named The Oswald Morris Building in honour of cinematographer Oswald Morris. It contains a 150-seat cinema which was upgraded in 2017 to support Dolby Digital and 4K DCP projection. In 2017, an additional teaching building opened on the site of a number of yellow classrooms on the north side of the site, and it houses a new studio, edit suites, dedicated sound design suites, as well as multi-purpose teaching spaces. The \\"Channel 4 Rose Building\\", also opened in 2017, incorporates teaching facilities, as well as an extra 60-seat cinema, caf√© and incubation space. The original 1960s TV studio was also upgraded to 4K capabilities with new Sony studio cameras and a high-end vision mixer, also from Sony. This was the only true-4K TV studio in the United Kingdom until Television Centre's TC1 reopened in September 2017. The sound infrastructure was also upgraded with a new Studer sound control surface capable of supporting 5.1 surround sound. This was named the Sky Studios at the NFTS studio.

The two story Greek Revival building was built in 1867, and is the only one of five schools built by the town in that period to survive. In the 1920s the building also served as a polling place and a site for town meetings. It was converted for use as a community center in the 1950s. The school was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The building is now owned by the Dennis Historical Society and open to the public on Friday afternoons in the summer. Description and history The West Dennis Graded School is set at the southwest corner of School and Pond Streets, a short way south of the main village area of West Dennis. It is a two-story wood frame structure, rectangular in shape, with a side gable roof, brick foundation, wooden clapboards on two sides, and wooden shingles finishing the other sides. The front facade, facing School Street, is symmetrically arranged, with a hip-roofed single-story porch extending across its width, supported by six Tuscan columns. The first floor bays are not evenly spaced, with two entrances, each flanked on its outer side by a sash window, set away from the center, while the upper floor has four evenly spaced sash windows. The building's corners have slightly projecting cornerboards, rising to a two-part entablature below the roof. The roof is capped at the center by a square cupola with an open belfry whose top is supported by eight square columns. When built in 1867, the school housed four classrooms, two on the west side of each level, with stairwells, coatrooms, and other facilities on the east side. On the second floor this plan is still in place, with wainscoted plaster walls, blackboards, and original door and window surrounds. On the first floor, the wall between the two classrooms was removed in the 1920s to accommodate town meetings, and a suspended acoustic tile ceiling was added in the 1970s. The cupola is a reconstruction of the original, also made in the 1970s, and houses a bell originally hanging in the South Dennis Graded School.

It contrasts with explicit self-esteem, which entails more conscious and reflective self-evaluation. Both explicit and implicit self-esteem are constituents of self-esteem. Overview Implicit self-esteem has been specifically defined as \\"the introspectively unidentified (or inaccurately identified) effect of the self- attitude on evaluation of self-associated and self-dissociated objects\\". Because by definition implicit self-esteem may not be accessible to conscious introspection, measures of implicit do not rely on direct self-reports, but rather infer the valence of associations with the self through other means. The vast majority of implicit self-esteem measures suggest that an individual's self-evaluation spills over to self-related objects. Also, these measures reveal that people, on average, have positive self-evaluations. The overestimation of one's traits and abilities is argued to be a spillover of positive affect from the self to objects associated with the self.Farnham, D. S., Greenwald, G. A., & Banaji, M. N. (1999) Implicit self-esteem. In D. Abrams & M. Hogg(Eds.), Social identity and social cognition (pp. 230-248). Oxford, UK: Blackwell. This \\"spillover\\" is automatic and unconscious. Implicit self-esteem therefore offers an explanation of positivity bias for things related to the self. Associations are especially important; implicit self- esteem is made up of a series of associations between the self and a positive or negative evaluation of the self. This is especially shown in measures of the Implicit Association Test. Influencing factors Several researchers have suggested that levels of implicit self-esteem can be affected by evaluative conditioning, through pairing of construct of the self with positive or negative stimuli, with the objective of altering attitude towards the self. In addition, social comparison, or more specifically the performance of people in one's close social circle, can also affect implicit self-esteem. This information suggests that expectancies of social inclusion is a factor in self-evaluation. Evaluative conditioning The influence of evaluative conditioning on implicit self-esteem is analogous to the principles of classical conditioning on behavioral responses. Although the latter involves pairing an unconditioned stimulus with a neutral stimulus repeatedly until presence of the neutral stimulus evokes the consequence of the unconditioned stimulus, evaluative conditioning involves pairing positive and negative stimulus with an internal construct- the self- to manipulate levels of implicit self-esteem. The effectiveness of evaluative conditioning hinges on the understanding that implicit self-esteem is interpersonally associative in nature, and that there is a causal relationship between the self and positive/negative social feedback. Studies have shown that participants repeatedly exposed to pairings of self-relevant information with smiling faces showed enhanced implicit self-esteem. In addition, studies have also found that pairing the word 'I' with positive traits heightens implicit self-esteem regardless of the level of temporal self-esteem prior to the conditioning process. Subliminal presentation of the stimuli reflected that implicit self- esteem is altered in the absence of consciousness. Given that evaluative conditioning changes attitude at a fundamental level and the evaluation that is automatically activated on encountering the attitude object, implicit self- esteem could be assessed as attitude towards the self. Social comparison The self-evaluation maintenance theory (SEM) suggests that the success of one's partner or \\"significant other\\" in areas that are self-relevant can cause people to feel threatened, allowing comparison of one's self to the self of another, impacting self-evaluation. Intimacy of relationships predicts likelihood of upward social comparison, which inevitably leads to lower implicit self-esteem. Given that the SEM is moderated by intimacy of relationship, its impact can be a prominent influential factor between romantic partners. Evidence shows that men tend to have lowered implicit self- esteem when their romantic partner succeeded than when they failed, automatically interpreting their romantic partner's success as their own failure. The underlying explanation might be that self-evaluation is driven by one's expectations around fulfillment of one's role as a man. Another explanation in line with the interpersonal nature of self-evaluation stems from the belief that women are attracted to men's success. Hence, the perception of failure in a man could trigger his fear associated with acceptance from his significant other, as well as abandonment issues. In general, studies of social comparison on implicit self-esteem has yielded the conclusion that comparisons with other individuals can impact one's self- esteem. In addition, these effects are greater when there is a close psychological identification with the partner with whom one is being compared. Consequences and correlations An individual's level of implicit self- esteem affects him or her in various crucial domains that are relevant to social, emotional, and cognitive well-being. In some cases, discrepancies between the implicit and explicit self-esteem effects affective well-being and are highly associated with clinical symptoms. Implicit self-esteem also determines how individuals approach relational conflicts and social settings. While low levels of implicit self-esteem can be erroneous, boosts in implicit self-esteem through mechanisms involved in narcissism can also impair an individual's performance in cognitive tasks and external representation of competence in occupational settings. Discrepancies between implicit and explicit self-esteem When explicit self-esteem is lower, it is called damaged self-esteem. When the implicit self-esteem is lower it is called defensive self-esteem. It has been found that individuals who tend to have a higher correspondence between implicit and explicit self-esteem, trust their intuition. =Damaged self-esteem= Individuals with a combination of high implicit and low explicit self-esteem possess what psychologists call a damaged self-esteem. Study results indicate that, in comparison to individuals with low implicit and low explicit self-esteem, individuals with damaged self- esteem exhibit more optimism and less self-protectionSteven J. Spencer, Christian H. Jordan, Christine E.R. Logel, Mark P. Zanna: Nagging doubts and a glimmer of hope. The role of implicit self-esteem in self-image maintenance. 2005. As cited by: as well as higher levels of both maladaptive and adaptive perfectionism. Damaged self-esteem has also been found to correlate with many clinical symptoms and disorders. In particular, the size of the discrepancy between implicit and explicit self-esteem in the direction of a damaged self- esteem has been found to correlate positively with heightened symptoms of depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation and loneliness. While implicit self- esteem itself is not correlated with these internalizing symptoms, the interaction between implicit and explicit self-esteem does. In particular, when individuals display low explicit self-esteem, their level of implicit self-esteem becomes directly and positively correlated with their level of suicidal ideation. This reflects the crucial role of implicit self-esteem in internalizing problems. We can understand the impact of a damaged self-esteem as an entrapment between goals, which stem from implicit self-esteem, and reality, which mediates explicit self-esteem. Indeed, damaged self-esteem has been found to correlate with a maladaptive pattern of perfectionism, which is hinged upon rigidly high expectations that often contribute to failure. The development of damaged self-esteem also showed a relationship to the use of self-defeating humor as a coping strategy, however, the causal direction is unclear. It could be that the frequent use of self-defeating humor lead to the development of damaged self-esteem (e.g., through a downward spiral of social rejection), or, that people with damaged self-esteem are more likely to use self-defeating humor (i.e., in line with their uncomplimentary view of the self). Another alternative is that both self-defeating humor and damaged self- esteem are caused by a third variable, such as neuroticism or alexithymia. Damaged self-esteem has also been found to correlate positively with internet addiction, the underlying mechanism of which parallels that of clinical conditions such as bulimia nervosa. This occurrence of compulsions may be attributed to an automatic defense mechanism in which the individual avoids anxiety. However, the development of a damaged self-esteem as an avoidance mechanism can also precipitate difficulties in establishing a consistent self- view. =Defensive self-esteem= Conversely, individuals with a combination of low implicit and high explicit self-esteem have what is called defensive self-esteem (or synonymously fragile self-esteem). In a comparative study it was found that individuals with defensive self-esteem tended to be less forgiving than others. Implicit self-esteem correlatesSocial performance= An important indicator of relationship stability and health is conflict behavior, the way individuals behave during a conflict. Peterson and DeHart found that implicit self-esteem can regulate connection during times of relationship crises. Studies suggest that individuals with high implicit self- esteem tend to engage more in nonverbal positive behaviors during conflict when they perceive their partners to be committed. Positive nonverbal behaviors during conflict is extremely predictive of relationship outcomes such as commitment, satisfaction and stability. Also, implicit self-esteem also predicts sensitivity towards partners‚Äô availability or support, even within a relationship-threat. That is, individuals high in implicit self- esteem tend to be implicitly motivated to consciously correct for connection and sensitivity to their partners‚Äô effort, despite explicitly doubting their investment in the relationship. This ability to overcome relationship-threats as perpetuated by high levels of implicit self-esteem is crucial to relational well-being. In addition, low implicit self-esteem has also been found to precipitate uncertainty in self-concept. This instability in grasping the self is especially erroneous in regulation of behaviors in social situations. It has been shown that uncertainty about the self makes people vulnerable to holding and expressing minority opinions, especially those who are susceptible to self-threat (low self-esteem). Individuals with low implicit self-esteem tend to respond defensively to self-threats, and because minority opinions are more self-diagnostic than majority ones, individuals may hold these opinions to shield themselves from threat of uncertainty. They also tend to take extreme views and to over-estimate the social consensus for their views. =Gender role= Gender differences play a vital role in implicit self- esteem in how it is influenced by the performance of the significant other. Women are more prone to trust their feelings and intuition, in contrast to men. The correlation between explicit and implicit self-esteem is greater for women then for men. Implicit self-esteem contains instinctive and empirical factors; then people who are in touch with their feelings, would report to have higher explicit self-esteem scores, which are consistent to implicit self-esteem scores. There were six studies that supported this idea, and these results were held in three diverse cultures, two unlike measures of implicit self-esteem. These ideas showed the correlation between implicit and explicit self-esteem. This is higher for women than men. =Cognitive performance= Self-affirming activities that significantly raises implicit self-esteem, such as viewing one's own Facebook profile page, has been shown to decrease motivation to do well in cognitive tasks of moderate difficulty. Results like this suggest that a peak in unconscious positivity associated with the self may discount an individual's efforts to further prove his worth in other areas. Consequently, this leaves an individual unmotivated to perform well in more practical settings. Measurement and assessment Implicit self-esteem is assessed using indirect measures of cognitive processing. These include the Name Letter Task and the Implicit Association Test. Such indirect measures are designed to reduce awareness of, or control of, the process of assessment. When used to assess implicit self-esteem, they feature stimuli designed to represent the self, such as personal pronouns (e.g., \\"I\\") or letters in one's name. Name-letter effect The so-called Name Letter Task (NLT, also called Initial Preference Task, IPT) relies on the name-letter effect and is one of the widest used measures of implicit self-esteem. Different measures have been proposed in order to improve the psychometrical properties of the name letter task. The name-letter effect represents the idea that an individual prefers the letters belonging to their own name and will select these above other letters in choice tasks or rate them as more favourable or attractive than other letters in rating tasks. It seemingly occurs subconsciously, with the mere-exposure effect ruled out as a possible explanation. This effect has been found in a vast range of studies. In one such scenario, participants were given a list of letters, one of which contained letters from their own name and the other of which contained other letters, and asked them to circle the preferred letter. This study found that, even when accounting for all other variables, letters belonging to the participants' own names were preferred. Similar results have been found in cross-cultural studies, using different alphabets. It is important to note the difference between the name-letter effect and 'implicit egotism', the latter being attributed to the way people gravitate towards places, people and situations that reflect themselves, including perhaps similarities with their own name. Indeed, research into the topic has shown similarities between people's names and their future careers; for example, the names Dennis and Denise are overepresented among dentists.Pelham, B.W., Mirenberg, M.C., & Jones, J.T. (2002) Why Susie Sells Seashells by the Seashore: Implicit Egotism and Major Life Decisions, Attitudes and Social Cognition Implicit- association test The implicit-association test is an experimental method used by psychologists to attempt to tap into a person's automatic, or subconscious association between a concept and an attribute. It has been widely used in an attempt to uncover a person's subconscious prejudices against certain members of society, such as those who are overweight, as well as other implicit stereotypes and associations. The test was formatted in order to measure self-esteem. Participants are asked to make rapid responses, co-classifying themselves (\\"the self\\") and positive attributes, as well as negative attributes. The speed, or ease of these associations made is said to show a subconscious, or implicit preference for one attribute over another, with regards to the self. =Findings= Many studies have shown that the vast majority of people's implicit self-esteem is positively biased. That is, people find it a great deal easier to associate themselves with a positive concept than a negative one. Whether this is truly displaying implicit self- esteem is arguable; the findings may instead be linked with illusory superiority, in that people tend to rate themselves as above average on a number of scales. Implicit self-esteem In the article \\"Stalking the perfect measure of implicit self-esteem: The blind men and the elephant revisited?\\", the validity and reliability of seven implicit self-esteem measures have been explored. The implicit measures were not correlated with one another. However they did correlate, but only faintly with measures of explicit self-esteem. The implicit self-esteem measurements confirmed partial reliabilities in correlation to good test-retest reliabilities. Nonetheless implicit measures were limited in their ability to calculate standard variables, for the test. Certain evidence explained that measurements of implicit self-esteem are delicate to put in context, which is further argued in later research of implicit self-esteem. =Links with explicit self-esteem= However, the validity of the implicit-association test and implicit self-esteem as a measure of self-esteem itself is questionable due to mixed evidence with regards to explicit self-esteem. On the one hand, researchers in a detailed and comprehensive study of implicit self-esteem found the IAT to correlate weakly, yet consistently, with measures of explicit self-esteem. However, more recent research has found measures of explicit self-esteem, such as questionnaires, to be independent of implicit self-esteem, providing an interesting insight into the validity of implicit self-esteem, explicit self-esteem, and the nature of self-esteem itself.

Biography  Florence Nightingale Levy was daughter to Joseph Arthur Levy and Pauline (Goodheim) Levy. She received a private school education during her childhood and adolescence, and she eventually enrolled in New York's National Academy of Design to study painting. However, she found herself drawn toward art history, prompting her to later change disciplines. Between 1894 and 1895 Levy studied Italian masters at √âcole du Louvre under Gaston Lafenestre, who was then curator of paintings at the museum. She also studied at Columbia University with John La Farge and John C. Van Dyke. In 1894, she founded American Art Annual magazine, serving as its editor until 1918. In 1901, she catalogued the art exhibition of the Pan-American Exposition. In 1909, she was one of the founders of the American Federation of Arts, and one of two female members in the male dominated organization. From 1909‚Äì1917, she was a staff curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. From 1922-1926, she was part-time director of the Baltimore Museum of Art. Levy also was general manager of the Art Alliance of America (1917‚Äì19), executive secretary of the Arts Council of New York City (1927‚Äì32), and executive secretary of the American Fine Arts Society (1941). Her notes are used as a source for the Benezit Dictionary of Artists, often being quoted as Florence N. Levy.

Built in 1858, it is a well-preserved example of Greek Revival architecture, notable for its continuous ownership by a single family. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 26, 1986, at which time it was owned by James Osmyn Berry, the great-grandson of its first owner.  Description and history  The Berry House is located in the village of West Harwich, on the south side of Main Street between Silver Street and Belmont Road. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with an irregular L-shaped plan and a clapboarded exterior. Its main section is rectangular and covered by a gabled roof, with a three-bay facade that has the main entrance in the left bay. A series of ells, apparently contemporaneous to the main block, extend to the left and rear, visually unified by Greek Revival trim elements. A porch extends left of the main block, supported by fluted Doric columns. On the property to the rear of the house stands a carriage barn that also dates to the period of the house's construction. The house was built in 1858 and is noted for its long association with the Berry family, whose history on Cape Cod dates as far back as 1643. James Berry, for whom it was built, owned several ships operating out of Harwich. The house was later owned by his brother Henry, and Henry's son Osmyn, both of whom were also sea captains. Osmyn Berry was the first captain to sail the Cape Cod Canal. By the 1970s the house had passed to Osmyn's grandson, the cartoonist James Osmyn Berry.
