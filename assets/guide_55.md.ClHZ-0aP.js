Marble, Roman artwork, 2nd century CE Cragus (Lycian league). The cithara or kithara (, ) was an ancient Greek musical instrument in the yoke lutes family. In modern Greek the word kithara has come to mean \\"guitar\\", a word which etymologically stems from kithara. The kithara was a seven-stringed professional version of the four-stringed lyre, which was regarded as a rustic, or folk instrument. As opposed to the simpler lyre, the kithara was primarily used by professional musicians, called kitharodes. The kithara's origins are likely Anatolian. The barbiton was a bass version of the kithara popular in the eastern Aegean and ancient Anatolia. Uses The kithara was the virtuoso's instrument, generally known as requiring a great deal of skill. The kithara was played primarily to accompany dance, epic recitations, rhapsodies, odes, and lyric songs. It was also played solo at the receptions, banquets, national games, and trials of skill. The music from this instrument was said to be the lyre for drinking parties and is considered an invention of Terpander. Aristotle said that these string instruments were not for educational purposes but for pleasure only. It was played by strumming the strings with a stiff plectrum made of dried leather, held in the right hand with elbow outstretched and palm bent inwards. The strings with undesired notes were damped with the straightened fingers of the left hand. Construction Greek vase drawing depicting a man playing a kithara with eight strings. Note the plectrum in his lowered left hand. Muse tuning two kitharai. Detail of the interior from an Attic white-ground cup from Eretria, 465 BCE. The kithara had a deep, wooden sounding box composed of two resonating tables, either flat or slightly arched, connected by ribs or sides of equal width. At the top, its strings were knotted around the crossbar or yoke (zugon) or to rings threaded over the bar, or wound around pegs. The other ends of the strings were secured to a tail-piece after passing over a flat bridge, or the tail-piece and bridge were combined. Most vase paintings show kitharas with seven strings, in agreement with ancient authors, but those same authors also mention that occasionally an especially skillful kitharode would use more than the conventional seven strings. Apollo citharoedus; Roman copy of Greek original of the 5th century BCE Apollo as a kitharode Apollo Kitharoidos. Painted plaster, Roman artwork from the Augustan period The cithara is said to have been the invention of Apollo, the god of music. Apollo is often depicted playing a cithara instead of a lyre, often dressed in a kitharode‚Äôs formal robes. Kitharoidos, or Citharoedus is an epithet given to Apollo, which means \\"lyre-singer\\" or \\"one who sings to the lyre\\". An Apollo Citharoedus or Apollo Citharede, is the term for a type of statue or other image of Apollo with a cithara. Among the best-known examples is the Apollo Citharoedus at the Vatican Museums, a 2nd century CE colossal marble statue by an unknown Roman sculptor. Sappho as a kitharode Alcaeus of Mytilene playing a kithara while Sappho listens in Sappho and Alcaeus by Lawrence Alma- Tadema (1881; The Walters Art Museum). Sappho is closely associated with music, especially string instruments like the kithara and the barbitos. She was a woman of high social standing and composed widely popular songs that focused on the emotions. A story from Greek myth goes that she ascended the steep slopes of Mount Parnassus where she was welcomed by the Muses. She wandered through the laurel grove and came upon the cave of Apollo, where she bathed in the Castalian Spring and took Phoebus' (Apollo's) plectrum to play skilful music. The sacred nymphs danced while she stroked the strings with much talent to bring forth sweet musical melodies from the resonant kithara. Famous cithara players * Phrynis () of Lesbos, suda mentioned that the Phrynis was the first to play the cithara at Athens and won at the Panathenaea. By cithara is probably meant the new 12-stringed instrument invented by Melanippides of Melos.Suda, phi.761 Other instruments called \\"cithara\\" In the Middle Ages, cythara was also used generically for stringed instruments including lyres, but also including lute-like instruments. The use of the name throughout the Middle Ages looked back to the original Greek kithara, and its abilities to sway people's emotions. Biblical references The cithara is mentioned a number of times in the Bible, but generally mis- translated into English as \\"harp\\" or \\"psaltery\\". Psalm 42 in the Latin Vulgate (Psalm 43 in other versions), says, \\"Confitebor tibi in cithara, Deus, Deus meus,\\" which is translated in the Douay-Rheims version as \\"To thee, O God my God, I will give praise upon the harp.\\" The King James version renders this verse as \\"Yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.\\" The cithara is also mentioned in other places in the Latin Vulgate version of the Bible, including Genesis 4:21, 1 Kings (1 Samuel) 16:16, 1 Paralipomenon (1 Chronicles) 25:3, Job 30:31, Psalms 32:2, Psalms 56:9, Psalms 70:22, Psalms 80:3, Psalms 91:4, Psalms 97:5, Psalms 107:3, Psalms 146:7, Psalms 150:3, Isaiah 5:12, Isaiah 16:11, 1 Machabees 3:45, and 1 Corinthians 14:7.

He wrote an early biography of Heinrich Heine and emigrated to the United States for a time. Biography He had a peripatetic youth, learning the classics in four gymnasiums. Although this was not conducive to learning the classics, it had the benefit of showing him things from several points of view and taught him the Danish language well. In 1848 he participated, on the side of the Germans, in the First Schleswig War. He was severely wounded and spent some time in Copenhagen harbor on the prison ship ‚ÄúDronning Maria.‚Äù On being set at liberty, he published Lieder eines Gefangenen auf der Dronning Maria (Songs of a prisoner of the ‚ÄúDronning Maria‚Äù, 1848). Strodtmann then became a student at the University of Bonn where he especially became devoted to Gottfried Kinkel; however, after a short time, he was suspended because of his political activities. He then published Lieder der Nacht (Songs of the Night, 1850) and a biography of Gottfried Kinkel (1850). He went to Paris, to London, and in 1852, he sailed for America, and with help from his father, the not-very- practical ex-student entered the book trade in Philadelphia, buying, selling and lending, as well as publishing a literary magazine called Die Locomotive. The business was not successful and closed in 1854, after which he traveled around the country pursuing literary interests, eventually settling in New York City. Weary of his various efforts to make a living, he returned to Germany in 1856, becoming a citizen of Hamburg. He covered the Franco-Prussian War for several newspapers, and in 1871, he moved to a suburb of Berlin where he lived for the rest of his life. The beginning of his writing career was mostly devoted to composing poetry, but as he became older and less revolutionary, he devoted more time to translation (into German) and literary history. He is most noticed as an early biographer of Heinrich Heine and a compiler of his work. He published the correspondence of the poet B√ºrger. He translated three works from French, but mostly concentrated on Danish and English which he knew better. A noteworthy example of his translations from English is his Amerikanische Anthologie of 1870. References Carl Schurz. New York: The McClure Company. 1907.

Construction and commissioning  USS LST-1170 was laid down on 21 April 1953 by the Christy Corporation, Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. She was launched on 22 May 1954, sponsored by Mrs. Joseph McCarthy, and commissioned on 15 December 1954 with Lieutenant Commander Max Wells in command.  Atlantic, Caribbean, and Mediterranean service  LST-1170 joined the United States Atlantic Fleet at her home port, Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek at Virginia Beach, Virginia, in January 1955. Following shakedown and type training, she was renamed USS Windham County (LST-1170) on 1 July 1955 and spent much of July and August 1955 in more training exercises. She then helped to support Operation Caesar, an underwater surveillance project, which lasted through the end of 1955. On 21 February 1956, Windham County reported to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard at Portsmouth, Virginia, for overhaul and conversion. Early January 1957 LST 1170 transported MCB 7, Detachment K (with all of their equipment) and a Detachment of Marines from Davisville, RI to Port Layouty, Morocco stopping at Lisbon Portugal for liberty. From January 1957 to mid- March 1957, Windham County operated off the Virginia Capes area. On 14 March 1957, after a brief stop at Davisville, Rhode Island, Windham County proceeded to the Caribbean for operations off Barbados. Upon returning to Little Creek on 1 April 1957, she operated from there until 2 May 1957, when she was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea for a tour of duty with the United States Sixth Fleet. During the cruise, she made stops at Tangier, Morocco; Spain; Malta; Italy; and Gibraltar. She returned to Davisville on 1 October 1957, then headed for Little Creek, arriving there on 18 October 1957. Windham County got underway for the Caribbean on 14 November 1957 for exercises. After returning to Little Creek on 26 November 1957, she ended 1957 undergoing routine upkeep.  Pacific service  In January 1958, Windham County transited the Panama Canal and arrived at San Diego, on 27 January 1958. Following some four months of operations on the United States West Coast, she sailed for the Western Pacific (WestPac) on 6 June 1958, touched at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, for a six-month deployment. While lifting United States Marine Corps units and cargo, she visited Kure, Kobe, Yokohama, and Sasebo, Japan; Subic Bay in the Philippines; Okinawa; Formosa; South Korea; and Hong Kong. Windham County returned to San Diego on 10 December 1958. The ship engaged in three full-scale amphibious warfare exercises the first half of 1959. She then operated along the southern California coast until 28 November 1959 when she headed north, arriving at San Francisco, California, on 1 December 1959. Following a two-month overhaul, Windham County returned to San Diego and spent the late winter and early spring of 1960 in intensive refresher training. The ship prepared for a change of her home port from San Diego to Yokosuka, where she was to become a unit of Landing Ship Tank Division 92 of Landing Ship Squadron 9. On 16 June 1960, the ship departed San Diego, and she arrived at Yokosuka on 19 July 1960. In September 1960, Windham County received notice that she and landing ship tank USS Whitfield County (LST-1169) would participate in a United Nations troop lift from Malaya to the Republic of the Congo. The two ships rendezvoused at Okinawa, then on 26 September 1960 departed for Singapore, where they arrived on 30 September 1960. Departing Singapore on 3 October 1960, the two ships arrived at Port Swettenham, Malaya, on 4 October 1960, where Windham County embarked 300 Malayan troops. The ships then steamed for 27 consecutive days, crossing the Indian Ocean, rounding the Cape of Good Hope on 22 October 1960, and navigating 82 nautical miles (150 kilometers) up the Congo River, before arriving at Matadi, Republic of the Congo, on 31 October 1960. They departed Matadi on 2 November 1960 and arrived at Cape Town, South Africa, on 11 November 1960. They then visited Singapore and Hong Kong before returning to Yokosuka on 20 December I960, where Windham County spent the rest of the year. On 4 January 1961, Windham County stood out to sea to carry Marine Corps troops from Iwakuni, Japan, to Naval Air Station Cubi Point, the Philippines. During February 1961, she carried another group of Marines from Okinawa to Numazu, Japan. On 24 March 1961, she began a period of shuttling Marines and equipment between Yokosuka and Okinawa which lasted until early in May 1961. She then participated in Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) Operation Pony Express on North Borneo in Indonesia. Upon the completion of this mission, she returned via Subic Bay to Yokosuka, where she arrived on 9 June 1961. On 1 August 1961, Windham County entered the Ship Repair Facility, Yokosuka, for an overhaul. Beginning on 23 October 1961, she conducted a three-week underway training period, and, on 20 November 1961, she commenced two weeks of amphibious training with the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. She then spent the remainder of 1961 at Yokosuka undergoing upkeep. Windham County sailed on 25 January 1962 for Numazu, Japan, to embark Marines. She took them to Okinawa, before visiting Hong Kong and Subic Bay. Shortly thereafter, she took part in SEATO Operation Tunlungan at Mindoro, the Philippines, and then reembarked participating troops for transport to Naha and Iwakuni, Japan. Windham, County visited Bangkok, Thailand, in June 1962 and in late July 1962 went to Inchon, South Korea, to pick up United States Army troops bound for Pohang, South Korea. Upon completion of that task, she returned to Yokosuka. Runs to Numazu and Naha with troops in October 1962 preceded her return to Yokosuka for upkeep. December 1962 brought her independent ship's exercises and Marine troop lifts from Numazu to Naha. On 3 January 1963, Windham County got underway for Hong Kong, where she served as a station ship and did much to promote the People-to-People Program. She returned to Yokosuka in February 1963, but left on 2 March 1963 to lift Marines to Taiwan and then spent the rest of March and most of April 1963 in upkeep in Yokosuka. From May through September 1963, Windham County underwent an overhaul which began in Sasebo and was completed at Yokosuka. October and November 1963 were devoted to underway and refresher training. On 5 December 1963, she headed for Okinawa for type training and a troop lift back to Japan. After unloading her passengers at Numazu, she returned to Yokosuka on 18 December 1963 for an inspection and upkeep period. Windham County sailed on 2 January 1964 for South Korea to participate in Operation Firehouse, a cold- weather amphibious assault exercise conducted at Chumunjin, South Korea. Late in January 1964 she returned to Yokosuka for upkeep and left on 26 February 1964 to take part in Operation Backpack, a joint American-Taiwanese practice amphibious assault which took place at Che Cheng, Taiwan. She returned to Yokosuka on 26 March 1964 and, from April until June 1964, conducted lifts and training exercises which took her to Taiwan; Iwakuni, Japan; Okinawa; and Hong Kong. On 17 June 1964, Windham County took on Republic of Korea Army students and carried them to Pusan, South Korea, to observe a demonstration of amphibious and beachhead staging techniques.  Vietnam War service 1964‚Äì1966  On 21 July 1964, Windham County got underway for operations in Okinawan waters. While these exercises were still in progress, the Gulf of Tonkin Incident occurred in early August 1964, resulting in a rapid buildup of American forces in South Vietnam and in nearby waters. Windham County loaded Marines and proceeded to the South China Sea, where she remained on station from 16 August 1964 to 28 September 1964 and spent 56 continuous days at sea. Windham County returned to Yokosuka on 19 October 1964. She visited Beppu, Japan, from 19 November 1964 to 23 November 1964 and participated in a variety of People-to-People Program activities. She proceeded to Iwakuni, Japan, for special operations which kept her busy until the latter part of December 1964, when she returned to Yokosuka for upkeep. During January 1965, Windham County was in Yokosuka for upkeep and type training. On 6 February 1965, she left for training at Pohang, South Korea, but was diverted to Okinawa on 8 February 1965 in a general alert of United States Seventh Fleet forces.

Leaving the shipyard on 12 October 1965, Windham County was engaged in personnel- and cargo-carrying missions along the coast of South Vietnam before returning to Yokosuka on 10 December 1965 for upkeep. Windham County departed on 6 January 1966 for Naha, Okinawa, and carried out numerous shuttles along the South Vietnamese coast. She arrived in Yokosuka on 5 June 1966 for hull repairs and, on 1 August 1966, commenced regular yard overhaul in Yokosuka. She began sea trials on 7 December 1966 and ended 1966 with type training and upkeep.  Vietnam War service 1967  Refresher training occupied January 1967, and Windham County sailed on 15 February 1967 for almost two months of operations off the coast of South Vietnam. On 15 April 1967, she headed for Okinawa and arrived at Naha on 20 April 1967. She returned to Yokosuka on 24 April 1967 but, after a month of upkeep, got underway again on 26 May 1967 to resume transport duties off South Vietnam.

She stopped briefly at Naha en route and also was diverted from her planned course to evade Typhoon Emma but finally reached Danang on 9 November 1967. From 10 to 16 November 1967, she supported Operation Badger Hunt and then moved to ƒê·ª©c Ph·ªï to conduct salvage operations for landing ships tank and , which had run aground there. After Iredell County had been pulled free, Windham County escorted her to Da Nang. Windham County then returned to ƒê·ª©c Ph·ªï to provide a ready helicopter for subsequent operations. During the remainder of her deployment to South Vietnam, she spent most of her time carrying troops, equipment, and mail to support operations ashore. On 27 December 1967, she was detached from these duties and proceeded to Japan.  Vietnam War service 1968  Windham County arrived in Yokosuka on 5 January 1968 and commenced a period of upkeep and inspections. She got underway for Kaohsiung, Taiwan, on 29 January 1968 to support Exercise Former Champ, a joint United States-Taiwanese amphibious exercise. While in Taiwan, she also participated in amphibious Exercise Final Round. Upon completing these, she headed for Yokosuka on 5 April 1968 and arrived there on 10 April 1968. She promptly began a cycle of upkeep, type training, and inspection. On 6 June 1968, Windham County left Yokosuka to return, via Okinawa, to South Vietnam to serve as a support ship for Task Group (TG) 117.2 in the Mekong Delta. She arrived at Wunder Beach, South Vietnam, on 17 June 1968 and unloaded 152 jeeps there before moving on to Vung Tau, which she reached on 20 June 1968 and where she began almost two months of duty supporting riverine warfare operations. On 15 August 1968, she set out for Thailand. After a five- day visit to Bangkok, she headed for Japan. However, Typhoon Wendy prevented her from stopping at Okinawa, and she proceeded to Yokosuka for a period of upkeep, arriving on 24 August 1968. She again departed Yokosuka on 3 October 1968 to return to South Vietnam. After several weeks of action, she reported to Subic Bay on 14 November 1968 for upkeep. She left the Philippines on 5 December 1968 and arrived at Yokosuka on 13 December 1968.  Vietnam War service 1969‚Äì1972  After a period of upkeep and inspections, Windham County departed Yokosuka on 10 March 1969 for South Vietnam. She spent the remainder of March, all of April, and the first part of May 1969 operating in the Mekong Delta. She departed on 10 May 1969 and returned, via Subic Bay and Hong Kong, to Yokosuka on 1 June 1969. She left Japan on 23 July 1969 and set a course for South Vietnam.

After a brief trip to Hong Kong, she returned to Yokosuka on 20 August 1970. From August through early December 1970, she was involved in shuttles between Okinawa and Japan and routine upkeep and inspection. On 12 December 1970, she got underway for South Vietnam. Windham County remained in the combat zone for the rest of 1970 and through 23 February 1971, when she was relieved and returned to Yokosuka, arriving on 12 March 1971. From then through 29 July 1971, Windham County was involved in routine shuttles between Okinawa, Numazu, Subic Bay, and Yokosuka. On 29 July 1971, she arrived in South Vietnam and engaged in various operations off the coast. On 7 September 1971, she was relieved and returned to Yokosuka, arriving there on 27 September 1971 to begin a period of restricted availability. Beginning on 9 November 1971, she made several shuttles to Okinawa and Numazu and went to Hong Kong. She was relieved on 17 December 1971 and returned to Yokosuka on 23 December 1971, remaining there for the rest of the year. Windham County departed Yokosuka in early February 1972 to resume her shuttle operations between Japan, Okinawa, and South Vietnam. In October 1972 she visited Singapore and Bangkok; in November 1972 she stopped in Hong Kong and Taiwan. She returned to Yokosuka in December 1972.

The towers of the church are called \\"pepper plant towers\\". An old legend says Saint Gertrude of Nivelles, abbess of the abbey in Nivelles, founded the church in 654. The older part of the church consisting of the towers, dates to around 1370. These were later incorporated in probably the fourteenth and fifteenth century when changes were made to the church. The building at that time was used for Catholic worship services. The current church building, completed in 1477 was designed by . He devised a new chancel with chancel ambulatory and vaults in the ship style of the Brabantine Gothic. History In 1489 Anthonis submitted to Keldermans a design for a new church in the Late Gothic style. In spite of a constant lack of money, a new chancel and transept were realized. During the troubles of 1580 the church was plundered and thereafter used as a military warehouse. A cannonade by the French in 1747 left the church devastated. In 1750 rebuilding efforts started again, albeit with a more sober character. The church was 9 meters lower after being rebuilt. In 1586 the church was arranged for reformed services. The new chancel and transept were completed and in 1698 were demolished. Thus only a small part remained of the second transept. Material was needed at this time for the construction of fortifications. From 1586 to 1966 the reformed congregation had this building in possession. In 1747 the building burned down after the bombardment by the French. Rebuilding took place using Protestant funds and Protestant stones. The reformed congregation retained control through the 1950s and 1960s and people began to regret that more and more. It appeared an impossible task to maintain such a large building. In 1966 the church was transferred to the municipality so the government could restore the building. New misfortune struck the church again in 1972 when a fire broke out. The whole interior including the 18th century pipe organ by Louis Delhaye II was lost. In the 1980s restoration started anew. The arrangement that followed would be that the municipality would keep the building and property in good maintenance, and the two Catholic parishes in the city center would merge to become the Sint Gertrudiskerk. The congregation would pay for heating the church and the municipality would receive a limited use charge. The large advantage of this agreement was that the empty restored church in time could be equipped with religious furnishings. Estimated cost for the restoration was ‚Ç¨ 1,000,000. In 1987, the church was again inaugurated by the bishop of Breda, Msgr. H. Ernst. Interior Engraving by Richard Collin after a design by Erasmus Quellinus II of the Tomb of Willem van der Rijt and Judith van Aeswyn, 1641 Among the interior features are a stained glass window honoring Saint Gertrudis, two pulpits, three Flemish confessionals and an Ibach pipe organ from 1863. Also some sepulchral monuments and several ecclesiastical objects are on display. Present In the second half of the 20th century the church was returned to the Catholic community and it is now a parish church. The church is also used for ecumenical ceremonies and special religious celebrations. Larger and smaller concerts are both being held here, thanks to the excellent acoustics. During performances the seating is turned away from the altar towards a special concert podium and the Ibach organ. References External links * Parochie H.

While the tower is still standing , it has been abandoned and is no longer safe to climb.

Today, MNF's Strip Mine Trail (Trail #350) traverses much of the area mined on the south side of Barton Knob and a ledge created continuing east along Cheat Mountain. Rainbow Gathering In 2005, the Rainbow Gathering considered using (and some may have used) strip-mined land near Barton Knob after being displaced from the original meeting site near Alpena. Forest restoration In late 2010, the Forest Service designated a section of Barton Knob as the Barton Bench Ecological Restoration Site. After strip mining, the land had been replanted with non-native grasses to protect the soil. This also led to an arresting of ecological development as the grasses kept out any native growths. The Forest Service is conducting experiments on various ways to restart ecological succession on the site with an eye towards eventual reforestation with native red spruce and hardwood trees.

Diplomatic relations between them were established on November 21, 1947. Canada is represented in Finland through its embassy in Helsinki. Finland has an embassy in Ottawa and 13 honorary consulates (in Calgary, Edmonton, Halifax, Montreal, Quebec City, Regina, Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury, Thunder Bay, Timmins, Toronto, Vancouver and Winnipeg). There are over 143,000 Canadians with Finnish ancestry and over 2,000 Canadian immigrants living in Finland.  World War II  In November 30, 1939, the USSR commenced an invasion of Finland. Immediately, the invasion became headline news, and the Canadian public were strongly in favor of \\"gallant Finland\\". About 250 Finnish-Canadians left Canada to defend Finland. At first, the idea of leaving Canada to fight in Finland was strongly opposed by the Canadian government. This was due to Finland being a major supporter of Nazi Germany. About 3 months later, the Canadian government completely changed their minds and rather supported the idea. Canada also sent food supplies, clothing and blankets to accompany the Finnish-Canadian fighters, but the 250 fighters did not reach Finland before the 13th of March, when the armistice was signed.  Human rights  Finland, like Canada, has traditionally played a very active role in promotion and protection of human rights, humanitarian assistance as well as arms control and disarmament, peacekeeping and crisis management. Over the past few years, Finland has demonstrated particular interest in Canada's human security policies (including responsibility to protect), and increasingly on the \\"Canadian model of multiculturalism\\". Trade Prior to the economic downturn, Canadian merchandise exports to Finland experienced vast increases - from (CAD) $473.9 million in 2006 to $1.0 billion in 2008. In 2010, exports to Finland plummeted to $400.9 million. In 2012, exports totaled at $423.6 million, showing a slight increase. Canada's main exports to Finland are mineral fuels and oil (not crude), machinery, pharmaceutical products, and vehicles. In 2012, Canadian merchandise imports totalled $1.046 billion, down from $1.074 billion in 2010.[1]  Investment  Finland is a large investor in Canada and a priority market for investment attraction. In 2010, direct investment from Finland in Canada was officially listed at $1.1 billion, making Finland Canada's 18th largest investor. Major Finnish investors in Canada include Nokia, Metso, Wihuri, Kemira, and others. In the same year, Canadian direct investment in Finland was officially listed as $152 million. Canadian companies active in Finland include Bombardier, Exfo, InMet and First Quantum Minerals. Canada's mining presence in Finland is estimated at over (CAD) $1 billion in cumulative mining assets. Arctic Relations Canada‚ÄìFinland relations on Arctic issues are strong. Addressing these issues is normally done through the Arctic Council, as both countries believe it to be the leading way of cooperation on Arctic issues. Canadian mining companies have a large presence in northern Finland. Roughly one third of all Finnish mines are Canadian-owned. Canadian companies are the largest employer in Lapland.

Cardona and David Mitton, features two groups of anthropomorphized tugboat fleets: the Star Fleet and the Z-Stacks. They compete against each other in the fictional town of Bigg City Port. In the North American adaptation, Salty's Lighthouse, the stories were re-purposed for a younger audience. The two groups were no longer rival tug fleets, and the characters underwent various changes. Sunshine, Captain Star, and Little Ditcher were considered female. Sunshine became the sister of fellow switcher Ten Cents. British accents were changed to American accents. Some names were changed, for instance, Big Mac became Big Stack, O.J. became Otis, and Zebedee became Zeebee. Star Fleet The Star Fleet is a group who aims to work together on getting and fulfilling port contracts. It is led by Captain Star. Its symbol is a red funnel with blue and white stripes around the top. Fleet members have yellow bodies and also carry a red flag with a white star. Reporting to Captain Star are seven tugs, each of which has a numbered smoke stack. In \\"Regatta\\", Grampus the submarine becomes a member of Star Fleet. The Star Fleet tugs are modeled after the San Francisco tugs of the 1920s. ‚Äì contains question/answer information from Chris Tulloch concerning the production of TUGS. =Ten Cents= Ten Cents (#1) works as a harbour switcher on a wide variety of tasks around Bigg City Port. Ten Cents is one of the younger, and he is one of the braver Star Tugs. He has a tendency to be somewhat cheeky at times, but is strong-willed, and it takes a lot to break him. He is quick-witted and takes action swiftly without hesitation. He never lets other tugs bully him, never fails to stand up for others, and is always willing to set aside his own safety for the sake of others. He has a bit of a short temper, but he is also smart enough to listen to the advice of the older, more experienced tugs. He speaks with a teenage East End Cockney accent. Chris Tulloch notes that Ten Cents was the first model he built for the series: \\"Ten Cents was 20 [inches] long, and his hull (fibreglass) was the basis for Zip and Zug.\\" Ten Cents was voiced by Simon Nash. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Shigeru Nakahara. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was voiced by Ian James Corlett. =Big Mac= Big Mac (#2) is a harbour tug who speaks with a Scottish accent. He can come across as a rude and stubborn tug, but he has a heart of gold, despite his tendencies to be macho, gruff and tough at times. He is very much willing to set aside his own safety for the sake of others, and usually (but not always) remains level- headed when undergoing a strategy. Big Mac works mainly with Warrior, and the two tugs have a very close friendship. Even though Warrior's clumsiness and thick head occasionally frustrates him, he still respects and cares for him. He also stands up for Warrior if anyone makes fun of him. As opposed to his gruff personality, he is fitted with a rich and melodic chime whistle. Big Mac was voiced by Sean Barrett. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Keiji Fujiwara. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was named Big Stack and was voiced by Paul Dobson. =O.J.= O.J. (#3) is the sole remaining paddle-driven harbour tug in Bigg City Port. He can be described as \\"slow, but versatile\\". As Captain Star once said in \\"Quarantine\\", \\"He had given many years of good service, but time was catching up on him\\". He is indeed capable of a variety of tasks, but is sometimes restricted by his age and mechanical condition. He speaks with a South Welsh accent. Chris Tulloch noted that the O.J. model used in the series was one of the most reliable. Other models, which had internal machinery, would often threaten to \\"turn turtle\\" and would have to be fixed firmly to a chassis. After the production of Tugs was shut down, his model was passed on to the sister series Thomas and Friends to be converted into \\"Lakesider lll\\", seen on the Skarloey Railway on Season 4. His model was later sold to The Star Tugs Trust along with his original head, wheelhouse, smokestack, and glasses (though at the moment, he is painted in the Lakesider lll livery). He was voiced by Timothy Bateson. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Masaaki Tsukada. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was named Otis and was voiced by Ian James Corlett. He is also the only Tug seen with a red waterline on his hull. =Top Hat= Top Hat (#4) is a railway tug with a top hat and monocle. He is very uppity and snobbish and tends to look down on most tugs, especially the Z-Stacks\\". He also believes he is the best tug in the Star Fleet. Despite his self-absorbed and arrogant demeanor, he means well, works hard and despite rarely showing it, he cares for the rest of the Star Fleet. He speaks in a posh English accent. After the filming of Tugs ended, sadly, Top Hat's model was presumed to be lost. He is one of the two Tugs characters who has not been sold to The Star Tugs Trust, along with Grampus. If Top Hat's model is found in the future, he may have his shocked face mask on. His other face masks are currently the only parts that are last left of him. He was voiced by John Baddeley. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Masashi Ebara. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was voiced by French Tickner. =Warrior= Warrior (#5) has a large face and blue flat cap, and speaks with a burly London accent. He usually works with Big Mac and sometimes, Top Hat. He is often clumsy and rather dimwitted, but tries not to mess up. He is known only to get in the way of the Z-Stacks. He is extremely hardworking, despite the fact that his inherent clumsiness often leads to problems. He is loyal, strong-willed, and determined, and never gives up. Despite Warrior's shortcomings, he has proved himself to be a valuable member of the Star Fleet with notable examples being when he helped put out the fires, saved Izzy Gomez and stopped the logs that were flowing from up the river. He was voiced by Nigel Anthony. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Mitsuaki Madono. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was voiced by French Tickner. =Hercules= Hercules (#6) is an ocean-going tug who is tasked with escorting large vessels to port, or answering distress calls at sea. He is in charge of large operations and important contracts. Hercules is a cool-headed fighter. He speaks with a clear, soft tone and received pronunciation, but his words are often hard. Although he can be strict and serious with his comrades, he also displays a gentler side and a sense of humour on occasion. Nothing can break him and not even the antics of the Z-Stacks and Bluenose can set him back. He is held in high regard by most of the tugs in the harbour, and even Zorran knows that he cannot win a confrontation with Hercules. He is not as seen as often as the other Star Tugs, mainly due to him being on his own missions. Hercules is famously known for referring to his colleagues as \\"m'dears\\", \\"old darlings\\", and \\"sweetheart\\". He was voiced by Nigel Anthony. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Sukekiyo Kameyama. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was voiced by Paul Dobson. =Sunshine= Sunshine (#7) is a small harbour switcher who performs various tasks. Sunshine can be occasionally cheeky at times, but he is very strong willed nevertheless. He is quick-witted and takes action swiftly without hesitation. He is generally level-headed and cheerful, and takes on most jobs with little complaining. He also appears to have a slight crush on Sally Seaplane. Sunshine speaks with a Geordie accent. Sunshine was voiced by Shaun Prendergast. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Y≈´ko Mita. In Salty's Lighthouse, Sunshine was the sister of Ten Cents and was voiced by Lenore Zann. =Grampus= Grampus (#8) is a small submarine that formerly worked for the Navy. He appears for the first time in the episode \\"Pirate\\", in which he helped to prove Ten Cents' innocence. In the episode \\"Regatta\\", he saved Lillie Lightship from sinking by plugging the hole in her side with his front. Later, he was nearly blown up by Bluenose the naval tug having been branded as 'too old' for further service and was out of commission. He was thankfully swiftly rescued by the Star Tugs Ten Cents, Big Mac, O.J., and Top Hat. On the same day, he was bought by Captain Star and joined the Star Fleet as their first Star submarine. He speaks with a Central English accent (with a noticeable lisp). Grampus also has a tendency to squirt water in the tug's faces, most prominently at Bluenose in \\"Regatta\\" and at Top Hat while he was sleeping in the episode \\"Ghosts\\". According to model maker Jeremy King, Grampus was modeled after Grampus-class submarines. Spike Knight fashioned Grampus in fiberglass by looking at old Grampus photos. He used a \\"parallel lifting version of the tugs' pull along trolleys so he could surface.\\" His model is one of two star characters that has not been sold to The Star Tugs Trust, along with Top Hat, his face masks are currently the only part that is last left of him, if Grampus's model is found in the future, his model may have his thrilled face mask. He was voiced by Lee Cornes. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Sakurako Kishiro. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was voiced by French Tickner. =Captain Star= Captain Star is the owner of the Star Fleet. He narrates the series in the past tense. He is quite obviously a veteran sailor, and owns and cares for the Star Fleet. He always appears as a loudhailer in the window of the Star Dock building. He takes great pride in his fleet, but he knows that it is important to be hard on them in order to succeed. He is usually very strict if something does not go as shipshape as it is supposed to. Captain Star was voiced by Patrick Allen. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Rokur≈ç Naya. In Salty's Lighthouse, Captain Star was a female character and was voiced by Lenore Zann. Z-Stacks The Z-Stacks are devious, tricky and scheming boats. Their leader is Captain Zero, although the first tug Zorran runs the day-to-day operations. They regularly find ways to hinder and infuriate their rival Star Fleet tugs. Their physical appearance is modeled after the 1920s Moran tugs that were active in New York City. =Zorran= Zorran Zorran is Captain Zeros first tug, and the fleet leader of the Z-Stacks. He is a harbour tug who hatches various devious schemes against the Star Fleet. Zorran is looked up to in fear from most of the other tugs. However, though being able to generally get what he is looking for, Zorran is depicted as a very pragmatic tug, who will be devious only as far as common sense and necessity allows. The majority of the episodes portray him as a leading antagonist in some way. Although he is undoubtedly the most intelligent Z-Stack, his plans usually end up backfiring: either through the incompetence of the other Z-Stacks or his own overconfidence. Zorran has shown to regularly employ fellow Z-Stacks Zip and Zug to carry out his operations, which more often than not results in adverse consequences. Zorran was voiced by Chris Tulloch. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Hajime Koseki. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was voiced by Scott McNeil. =Zebedee= Zebedee is Captain Zeros second tug; he performs a variety of tasks around Bigg City Port. Like the other Z-Stacks, Zebedee is based on the NYC Moran Fleet tugs from the 1920s. His personality resembles Shemp Howard. Zebedee is one of the more complex Tugs characters, an easy-going tug who winds up the Star Fleet for a reason or another mean and vindictive on the outside, but on the inside there is much to his personality. Beneath his tough exterior is the only Z-Stack to have a conscience. In the episode \\"High Winds\\", his guilty conscience proves he has good in him when he helps the Star Fleet tow the liner Princess Alice. He was once offered to join the Star Fleet but refused, saying he is a Z-Stack at his heart. Zebedee's lighter side was never examined again in the series, but it was in another form of media which stated his owner was Captain Star, meaning it would have been expanded on in Season 2. He was voiced by Sean Barrett. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by K≈çji Ishii. In Salty's Lighthouse, his name was pronounced \\"Zee-Bee\\" and was voiced by Ian James Corlett. =Zak= Zak is the third member of the Z-Stacks and usually works with Zebedee. Like the rest of the Zero Marine, Zak is based on the Moran Fleet tugs from the Roaring 20s. Zak has been seen as a second-in- command to Zorran. He was voiced by Shaun Prendergast. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Hideyuki Umezu. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was voiced by Scott McNeil. =Zug= As the fourth tug in the Z-Stacks, Zug is a harbour switcher that tows barges and works on liner docking operations. He mainly works with Zip, and likes to think of himself as the intelligent one. He comes up with devious plans for him and Zip to use (although the plans usually fail). Zug's capabilities range from the towing of barges to liner docking operations. Like the rest of the Zero Marine, Zug is based on the Moran Fleet tugs of the 1920s. He is sneaky, cowardly and he needs the other Z-Stacks around for courage. Zug is a scheming sort of tug, though his plans rarely if ever work as planned. Zug is intimidated by the main Z-Stack Zorran and has a tendency to be somewhat nervous and jittery around him. He was voiced by Nigel Anthony, with a Central European accent reminiscent of Peter Lorre. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Tar√¥ Arakawa. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was voiced by Scott McNeil. =Zip= Zip is the second harbour switcher in the Z-Stacks fleet. He works alongside Zug on minor contracts such as the freighting of quarried boulders. Zip is often described as 'Zug, only worse'. His head is often in the clouds, and he is well known for being a coward. He is easily scared and sometimes speaks out of turn, as well as being quick to back down when engaging in an argument, and is easily dominated. He was voiced by John Baddeley. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Masashi Ebara. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was voiced by Ian James Corlett. =Captain Zero= Captain Zero is the owner of the Z-Stacks. Unlike Captain Star, he is the devious and scheming sailor. He is known to have criminal connections and was originally affiliated with Johnny Cuba before something happened between the two. He is also known to be quite bad tempered. He was voiced by Sean Barrett. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Masaaki Tsukada. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was voiced by Paul Dobson. Supporting characters =Izzy Gomez= Izzy Gomez is a large tramp steamer who regularly visits Bigg City Port with items such as bananas from Puerto Grande. He has said numerous times that he would rather try to get into port on his own instead of being pulled by any of the tugs and actually tries in the episode \\"Warrior\\". He was one of the models later used for Thomas and Friends after the production of Tugs shut down, his model was used as a tramp steamer seen at Brendam Docks from seasons 3-5. It is unknown where his model is currently. His face masks are currently the only parts that are the last left of him. Izzy spoke with a Mexican accent, and was voiced by Sean Barrett. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Rokur≈ç Naya. In Salty's Lighthouse, he had an American accent (despite still having a sombrero and the Mexican flag painted on his smokestack) and was voiced by Paul Dobson. =Lillie Lightship= Lillie Lightship is a lightship that is situated at Demder Rocks to warn shipping of potential hazards. She has a contract with the Star Fleet where they provide her with the necessary fuel and supplies to keep her light shining. She was voiced by JoAnne Good. In the Japanese dub, she was voiced by Sakurako Kishiro. In Salty's Lighthouse, she was voiced by Lenore Zann. Minor characters The following is a list of fictional characters in the children's television series Tugs. All of these characters played supporting roles to the series' main characters' in the fictional harbour of Bigg City Port. =Tugboats= Sea Rogue Sea Rogue is also known as \\"The Pirate\\" - his only appearance is in the episode of the same name. In darker times, he stole barges for two mysterious green-eyed tugs, who had captured his uncle, and threatened to scuttle him unless Sea Rogue stole more barges for them; similar then, to Zebedee's relationship with the tramper Johnny Cuba in the episode \\"High Winds\\". The Green-Eyed Pirates were later caught out by Ten Cents, Sunshine, Grampus, and Sea Rogue himself, who devised a plan to capture the two fiends. Sea Rogue had been previously mistaken for the pirate himself, hence his nickname, and he later forgave the Star Tugs for ever thinking that about him. He then returned to a peaceful life with his uncle. He was voiced by Sean Barrett. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Keiji Fujiwara. Sea Rogue was completely black, and did not seem to work for any particular fleet; although the \\"Mi\\" symbol on his stack suggests that he worked for the munitions company, as the same symbol is seen on the factory and warehouse doors. His model was later repainted to be used for Bluenose. Sea Rogue also appeared on the TLC TV series, Salty's Lighthouse, except he became a villain who steals cargo, but only existed in Top Hat's dreams. Here, he was voiced by Paul Dobson. Bluenose Bluenose is an obnoxious navy tug, whom both the Star Fleet and Z-Stacks despise. He plays precisely by the rules and acts as a kind of stereotypical army drill sergeant towards the other tugs. He is annoying, pompous, and self-centered, and despite appearing in only two episodes of the series (\\"Regatta\\" and \\"Munitions\\") he caused a major impact and is often referred to as a major character. He speaks with a regimented Army English accent. His major storyline was involved with blowing up the midget submarine Grampus in target practice, but Grampus was saved at the last minute and later became a member of the Star Fleet. After the episode \\"Munitions\\", Bluenose was left a nervous wreck, after a terrible night at the docks involving the death of the naval tramp steamer Kraka-Toa. He is later towed away by Grampus. He was not seen again after this. He was voiced by Sean Barrett. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Rokur≈ç Naya. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was voiced by Scott McNeil. The term 'bluenose' was a nickname for people who came from the Canadian province of Nova Scotia - in the context of the show it may also have been a pun on the term 'Brown-nose', or suck-up - given Bluenose's orders-following mentality it can be said that he is a 'naval brown-nose', hence, possibly, 'Bluenose'. Fire Chief Fire Chief The Fire Chief, also referred to as the Fire Launch, was in his own right, quite a significant character. Although he did not have his own individual name, and only appeared briefly in four episodes (in one of which he had no dialogue), he had a major role in the health, safety and well-being of Bigg City Port and its inhabitants. He is seen as an authoritarian figure and was often around when chaos was stirring in the Port. The Fire Tug is level-headed and down-to- earth. He is usually bright eyed, although his stubble makes him appear quite rough. He speaks with a Cockney accent. He is painted white and red. Like Billy Shoepack, the Fire Tug could move his head and eyes rather than immobile features. He was voiced by Sean Barrett. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by K≈çji Ishii. Boomer Boomer was found floating adrift in the episode \\"Jinxed\\" by Ten Cents and Sunshine, where he revealed he was a jinx (which Ten Cents was very sceptical about). After many incidents, including almost sinking and his engine failing then catching fire, Ten Cents finally believed that he had a bad luck streak. After he was repaired at Lucky's Yard, Captain Star decided that Boomer was to become a houseboat, and he now resides at an upriver jetty called \\"Dun Tuggin\\" where he can relax all day, and the jinx has finally left him. Boomer was originally called Captain Harry, and he says that he became jinxed when his name was changed to Boomer. Boomer is the only tug, except from the initial seven, to become a Star Tug during the series, even if it was only for a very short period. He was also briefly a Z-Stack when he helped Zip and Zug pull some munitions, but after the barge exploded Captain Zero got rid of him. Boomer can also be seen towing barges in the background of the episode \\"Up River\\", and with this exception, he was never featured in the series again, nor was it revealed how he ended up adrift. Boomer spoke with an Irish accent, and was voiced by Lee Cornes. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Tar√¥ Arakawa. Boomer also appeared in Salty's Lighthouse, experiencing two very different adventures. In one episode he failed towing the schooner (as in the original TUGS) and became a 'vacation boat' in a story Ten Cents told to Zug. In the other one, he lost his 'bad luck' by successfully towing the schooner. During these episodes, he was voiced by Scott McNeil. Boomer's history reflects the naval superstition that changing the name of a ship invokes bad-luck. His name in naval and military slang is the nickname for submarines armed with ballistic missiles/nuclear ICBMs - though it is highly improbable that Boomer has any connection to nuclear weapons (having predated their invention by two decades) it can safely be said that he had a similarly intense impact on the tugs of Bigg City Port. Billy Shoepack Billy Shoepack Billy Shoepack is an alligator tug. He carries supplies such as fuses and dynamite to the Upriver towns. Billy spoke with a strong West Country accent, and was voiced by Lee Cornes. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Mitsuaki Madono in \\"Trapped\\" and Rokur≈ç Naya in \\"Up River\\". In Salty's Lighthouse, he was voiced by Paul Dobson. Sea Rogue's Uncle Sea Rogue's Uncle was never named, although he was referred to as \\"Old Man\\" by his nephew Sea Rogue. He was an elderly tug with a brownish colour scheme, appearing only in \\"Pirate\\". He was kidnapped by the \\"Green- Eyed\\" tugs, who held him as ransom in order to make his nephew steal barges, and was later rescued by Grampus. He was voiced by Shaun Prendergast. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Masaaki Tsukada. His model was later reused for Boomer. Burke and Blair Burke and Blair were notorious scrap dealers, and scavengers. Burke was the one with a moustache, and Blair was the one who wore glasses. They were always seen together, and had small appearances in many episodes across the series. The only episode in which they speak is \\"Quarantine\\", when they try - and almost succeed in - convincing Captain Star to sell O.J. for scrap. Burke and Blair were often seen in the background, most notably at the end of the episode \\"Ghosts\\". Their names come from the notorious Edinburgh corpse sellers Burke and Hare and they are sort of tugboat versions to their human counterparts, in that they deal in dead boats - not people. Nigel Anthony voiced Burke and Sean Barrett voiced Blair. In the Japanese dub, Hideyuki Umezu voiced Burke and Mitsuaki Madono voiced Blair. In Tugs American counterpart, Salty's Lighthouse, Burke and Blair were movie producers called Mr. Boffo and Mr. Socko. Here, they were both voiced by Paul Dobson. The Pirates A pair of villainous tugboats who slipped into Bigg City Port with the intention of stealing loaded barges that could be sold off illegally for trade. To increase their security, they used Sea Rogue as their decoy. To make sure that he performed their bidding, they took Sea Rogue's uncle hostage and threatened to sink him if he disobeyed them. With the unexpected help of Zip and Zug, the Star Fleet and Sea Rogue were able to capture the pirate tugs and hand them into the authorities. The pirate tugs were mysterious-looking vessels with black paint and a distinguishable pair of green-tinted spotlights. They are known among fans as 'The Green-Eyed Things'. The pirate tugs are among the few speaking tugboats among the cast that do not have faces. They were voiced by John Baddeley and Sean Barrett respectively. In the Japanese dub, they were both voiced by Rokur≈ç Naya. Their models were later turned into Burke and Blair. The White Fleet A fleet of tugboats who came to Bigg City Port during the midst of winter. They came from 'northern waters' in search of an iceberg, and travelled about the harbour at night with engines 'off', listening for cracking ice. They were mistaken by the Star Fleet, Zorran, and Izzy Gomez for the phantoms of a tug fleet that sank in the great storm of 1912. After an eventful night, Hercules revealed the truth behind the White Fleet. Since then, the Star Tugs found they could laugh it off, but never forgot the night when fog nearly drove them crazy. Two of the White Fleet models were those of Burke and Blair. The Coast Guard The Coast Guard is a small vessel who acts as customs officer for the port. He often stands at the entrance to the estuary; ready to question and check incoming shipping before clearance. On other occasions, he stands by and over-looks large-scale operations, such as demolition and quarry work. He also doubled as a 'one-man' police-force. Despite his size, he has heavy influence and authority over the vessels of the port. He has made numerous brief appearances, but also made speaking roles in \\"High Winds\\", \\"Warrior\\" and \\"Quarantine\\". Because of his small size, remote eye mechanisms could not be fitted into his model. He was one of the models passed on to Thomas and Friends after the production of Tugs shut down, he was seen in season 4, but it is unknown where his model is at the moment. In the Buzz Books, the Coast Guard was referred to as the Customs Launch. He spoke in a posh English accent, and was voiced by Lee Cornes. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Sukekiyo Kameyama. In Salty's Lighthouse, the Coast Guard was called Cappy and was voiced by Paul Dobson. Coast Guard's Messenger A small motor boat with a shrill whistle, he appeared only briefly in \\"Regatta\\" to inform the Star Fleet of Lillie Lightship's predicament; having been sent by the Coast Guard to deliver the message. The same small vessel doubled as the 'mad' speed boat that caused the accident in \\"Quarantine\\". He was in this form before \\"Regatta\\", as he appears in the liner scene of Warrior in \\"Sunshine\\". He is located beside the Fire Launch. He was voiced by Nigel Anthony. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Mitsuaki Madono. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was mistakenly thought to be the same character as the Coast Guard and also became Cappy. Just like the other Cappy, he was voiced by Paul Dobson. =Ocean liners= The Duchess The Duchess appears in \\"Sunshine\\", the very first episode, making her the first ocean liner we encounter in the series. She only appeared in two scenes in the whole of that episode: first when the Star's were towing her in, and again in the nighttime firework celebrations following a successful journey. In appearance, she looked a lot like Princess Alice - and it is possible she was the same model - only with modified funnels and ventilators. Her profile card in the Tugs board game gave her nationality as British. Princess Alice Princess Alice was the most prominent of the three Liners - she appeared in three episodes (\\"High Winds\\", \\"High Tide\\", and \\"Regatta\\"), in \\"High Winds\\", she was in need of repair and the Stars (and Zebedee) all fought against the heavy winds to bring her safely into port. When she appeared in the 12th episode \\"Regatta\\", she was fully repaired - and was celebrating Independence Day heartily with the other vessels whilst being loaded by Big Mickey. In \\"High Tide\\", she only made a brief cameo. Her profile card in the Tugs board game gives her nationality as American. S.S. Vienna S.S. Vienna appeared in the episode \\"Bigg Freeze\\", in which the Star Tugs and Z-Stacks alike were eagerly awaiting her return. In some videos she appears in the opening credits, and her model also made a brief appearance in \\"Sunshine\\". The model used for S.S. Vienna was later reused for Thomas and Friends, which can be seen at Brendam Docks. It is renamed S.S. Roxstar in a Season 4 episode - \\"Henry & the Elephant\\". Vienna was given her name solely to create an excuse for the characters to say \\"Goodnight, Vienna!\\" at the end of \\"Bigg Freeze\\" - in a further in-joke, Goodnight Vienna was the fourth solo album of Thomas narrator Ringo Starr. =Tramp steamers= Johnny Cuba Johnny Cuba is a notorious and violent tramp steamer gangster. His strong accent and dialect indicate that he is from Australia, although in a Tugs- themed card game it is said that he is from Cuba. His first appearance was in \\"High Winds\\". He was voiced by Nigel Anthony. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Tar√¥ Arakawa. Cuba had arrived at Bigg City Port to make plans with fellow criminal friends during a period of strong and troublesome tempest weather. When he arrived, he met Zebedee and threatened him by manipulating him into helping him into the port. Cuba sent Zebedee on an errand to steal a barge of coal, and threatened to sink him if he landed either of them in trouble. Due to a feud between Cuba and Captain Zero that occurred in the past, Zebedee was placed in an awkward and dangerous situation, until Hercules discovered Cuba's hide-out in an abandoned dock. Zebedee plucked up the courage to trap Cuba and have him arrested, and was forgiven. Despite Cuba's claim that \\"they can't hold Johnny Cuba!\\", they did. Johnny Cuba only appeared in \\"High Winds\\", but his model made five more brief appearances in \\"Sunshine\\", \\"Quarantine\\", \\"Ghosts\\", \\"Munitions\\" and \\"Regatta\\". In \\"Regatta\\" it sank in Dender Rocks after colliding with Lillie Lightship. His superstructure and funnel were used for Old Rusty. Johnny Cuba made a second appearance in the annual story, \\"The Missing Barge\\", where he is still doing crime but no one wants to go near him. Cuba made a third appearance in the Buzz Book \\"Nothing to Declare\\", in which he helps the Navy by trapping a spy submarine and proves himself to have a good and patriotic streak. In Salty's Lighthouse, his name was changed to Steamer and was a friendly character instead of a villain. Here, he was voiced by French Tickner. Nantucket A dirty old tramper and a notorious villain, whom the Tugs call Dirt Bucket. His only appearance was in \\"Quarantine\\", in which he attempted to trick Sunshine into taking him into port by pulling down the yellow \\"waiting for clearance\\" flag. After his plan was foiled, he was sentenced by the Coast Guard to a further forty days in quarantine along with Zorran (who had fallen for the trick and pulled alongside him). He spoke with a Lancastrian accent provided by Sean Barrett. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by K≈çji Ishii. Nantucket's hull was later used for Old Rusty. He also appeared as the tramper that Billy Shoepack blew up in \\"Trapped\\". In Salty's Lighthouse, Nantucket's name was changed to Tramper. He became a friendly character, and sometimes could not speak (in which case a foghorn sound effect was used instead). In the appearances where he did speak, he was voiced by Paul Dobson. Kraka-Toa This naval tramp steamer made her first appearance in \\"Ghosts\\" and her final appearance in \\"Munitions\\". Due to a fuel drum falling onto some explosives after Bluenose hit Zorran's barge, the dock caught fire; thus setting off the explosives and fuel loaded in her at the time. Since she was nearly full, the contents did indeed \\"rip her apart\\" as Zorran predicted, and she sank into the bay, but continued to appear in the background hinting she was recovered. She never spoke. She was named after the Krakatoa volcano, which famously erupted in 1883, causing much devastation. Old Rusty Old Rusty is possibly a naval tramp steamer, who made only one brief appearance, at the end of the episode \\"Warrior\\"; anchored out in the estuary. Warrior dozed off and bumped into him, telling him to look where he was going, but Old Rusty said that he had been anchored there for two years. Old Rusty was voiced by John Baddeley. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by K≈çji Ishii. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was voiced by Paul Dobson. =Dockside and floating cranes= Big Mickey Big Mickey is described as 'the Port's biggest crane'. He was once stationed at the steel works quay for loading and unloading operations when the Star and Zero fleets were competing for the steel company contract. He was later transferred to the naval dock for the loading of the naval tramper Kraka-Toa. He has two note-worthy appearances in \\"High Tide\\" and \\"Munitions\\". There is some debate as to the fate of Big Mickey. In the television release of \\"Munitions\\", it is stated that Big Mickey had fallen into shallow water and survived. However, this narration was deleted in the video release. According to the tugboats' reactions he perished to save them, although this may simply mean he took a big fall for them. The model used for the Big Mickey character was recycled to be used in Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends, originally starting off as a background prop, he later became a character on the show retaining the same name. He is one of the only two Tugs characters (the other being the S.S. Vienna) to survive the transition into CGI. In season 21, he was given a face and the ability to speak again. He was voiced by Timothy Bateson. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Masaaki Tsukada in \\"High Tide\\" and Tar√¥ Arakawa in \\"Munitions\\". When he gained a face in Thomas & Friends, Rob Rackstraw took over as the english voice actor for Big Mickey. Mighty Mo Mighty Mo is Bigg City Port's largest floating crane, well known for his booming voice. He is used for many salvage operations, in which he usually takes charge. He appeared for the first time in \\"Jinxed\\", in which his hawser jammed whilst lifting Boomer out of the water. He also appeared in the episodes \\"High Tide\\" and \\"Regatta\\". He was voiced by Nigel Anthony. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by K≈çji Ishii. Little Ditcher Little Ditcher is a small dirty A-frame crane, and is therefore, one of the smaller floating cranes to be found in the port. He is sometimes used dredging up- river at Mittsville or for oyster fishing in the estuary, as well as various other jobs. His size makes him unsuitable for rescue operations. He is good friends with the Star Tugs, and appeared for the first time in \\"Trapped\\". Little Ditcher was voiced by Timothy Bateson. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Keiji Fujiwara in all of his appearances; excluding \\"Trapped\\" where he was voiced by K≈çji Ishii. In Salty's Lighthouse, he became a female (along with Captain Star and Sunshine) and was voiced by Lenore Zann. Scuttlebutt Pete Scuttlebutt Pete is a dredger and a notorious gossip - hence his name. He believes in ghosts, and enjoys voicing superstitions and telling old sea stories, particularly when the fog comes around. Although he can be grumpy, he is a friend to the Star Tugs. However, dredger detail is an unpopular task with the tugs, and is often given out by the Captains as punishment. He speaks with an exaggerated Dublin accent. He was voiced by Nigel Anthony. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Hideyuki Umezu. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was voiced by French Tickner. Jack the Grappler Jack the Grappler is a garbage scooper who works at the \\"Municipal Garbage Corporation\\" quay for garbage barges, particularly Lord Stinker. He assisted in the organisation of the Municipal Garbage Corporation float for the annual regatta. He first appears in \\"Regatta\\" (in which he briefly wore an Uncle Sam- style top hat). In the episode \\"Bigg Freeze\\", he had a cold (as he was shown with a red nose). In the series, the narrator refers to him as \\"Jack the Grapper\\", possibly indicating a pun on Jack the Ripper (if only in name). He is the only crane with a face. He was voiced by Sean Barrett. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Hideyuki Umezu. In Salty's Lighthouse, he became Scoop and was voiced by Paul Dobson. =Barges= Lord Stinker Lord Stinker is an aged garbage barge, widely known for carrying a heavy stench, and notably wears a peg on his nose to avoid his own strong odor. He works mostly with Warrior. He is also a quick thinker as he saved a train from disaster in \\"High Tide\\", which gained him a newfound respect from Top Hat. He was voiced by Timothy Bateson. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Tar√¥ Arakawa in all of his appearances; excluding \\"Warrior\\" where he was voiced by Sukekiyo Kameyama. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was voiced by Ian James Corlett. Frank and Eddie Frank and Eddie are a pair of twin railway barges (also known as Car floats) who work mostly with Top Hat the railway tug. They are used for the transportation of railway stock across the port. They are very quick- witted and are among the few that can deal with Top Hat's superiority. Both of the twins speak with Cockney accents. Nigel Anthony voiced Frank and Timothy Bateson voiced Eddie. In the Japanese dub, Frank was voiced by Keiji Fujiwara while Eddie was voiced by Tar√¥ Arakawa in \\"Munitions\\" and Sukekiyo Kameyama in \\"High Tide\\". In Salty's Lighthouse, they were both voiced by Ian James Corlett. Pearl Pearl is an oyster barge, who made her only appearance in \\"Warrior\\" working with Sunshine and Little Ditcher out in the estuary. She was voiced by JoAnne Good. In the Japanese dub, she was voiced by Sakurako Kishiro. =Other characters= The Fultan Ferry The Fultan Ferry is a paddle-driven ferry boat used for freighting vehicles and goods across the harbour. It appeared in various episodes, but was finally named in \\"Quarantine\\", when it was temporarily sunk in the middle of the port after hitting a fire barge towed by O.J.. It was later salvaged by Mighty Moe. Although the Ferry never spoke in the original show, it was voiced by Scott McNeil in Salty's Lighthouse (despite not having a visible face or megaphone). It also happened to be confirmed as a male, and even went under the name Fultan by Grampus. Since Tugs ceased production, the Fultan Ferry has appeared briefly in Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends. The Shrimpers The Shrimpers appear in various episodes. They had a note-worthy role in \\"Ghosts\\", when a group of four or five were accidentally led into a mud-bank whilst following Warrior back to port; using him as a guide through the fog. Their models were passed on to Thomas and Friends after the production of TUGS shut down. They were seen in Season 4 around the Skarloey Railway and the docks. It is currently unknown where their models are at the moment. They were voiced by both John Baddeley and Chris Tulloch. In the Japanese dub, they were voiced by Sukekiyo Kameyama, Keiji Fujiwara, and Hideyuki Umezu. Municipal Garbage Corporation The owner of the Municipal Garbage Corporation yard organizes the 'Municipal Garbage Corporation' float for the annual regatta. He only appeared in a famous scene from \\"Regatta\\". Although he was never referred to by name, his office door revealed it to be O. Krappenschmitt. He was voiced by Timothy Bateson. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Masaaki Tsukada. In Salty's Lighthouse, he was voiced by Paul Dobson. Quarry Master The owner of the rock quarry, who appears briefly in \\"Warrior\\". He was voiced by John Baddeley. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Masaaki Tsukada. In Salty's Lighthouse, the Quarry Master was given the name Stoney and was voiced by Paul Dobson. The Fuel Depot Owner The owner of the Fuel Depot appears briefly in Bigg Freeze, having to put up with Zorran's impatience. He was voiced by Lee Cornes. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Rokur≈ç Naya. Sally Seaplane Sally is a seaplane who is a friend of the Star Fleet, who have the contract to provide her fuel. Sunshine appears to have a slight crush on her. She appears only briefly in a selected number of episodes, and spoke only in Sunshine. Sally's technical definition is a 'Flying Boat' because her main source of buoyancy, like a ship, comes from her hull/fuselage with small floats on each wing to stabilise her, unlike the other form of seaplane - the 'floatplane' which uses a normal aircraft fuselage with large floats slung underneath to support it on water. If we expand on this she can be termed an 'Amphibious Flying Boat' because she has fold-up landing gear on her fuselage, allowing her to land on runways as well as water. Sally's tail- number is S-ALLY, a fictional sequence that would not be assigned to a real plane - any civil aircraft registered in the United States has a tail-number beginning with the letter 'N'. As the original prop has been presumed lost, The Star Tugs Trust are receiving a rebuilt Sally model from the owner of the original Seaplane moulds, arriving in Easter 2017. She was voiced by JoAnne Good. In the Japanese dub, she was voiced by Y≈´ko Mita. In Salty's Lighthouse, she was voiced by Lenore Zann. Puffa Puffa is a steam locomotive who works on the dockside railway at Bigg City Port. Used for a variety of tasks within the port and at the docks up river, he is a trusted friend of the Star Fleet and Warrior in particular. He has made two appearances in \\"Up River\\" and \\"Munitions\\", and also made a brief appearance in \\"High Tide\\". Other trains seen around Bigg City have the same whistle-sound and feature similar styling as Puffa. In \\"Munitions\\", he was warned by Ten Cents, O.J., Zorran, Zak, and Zebedee to escape from a dockside fire. In the episode \\"Up River\\", he raced down river from the logging camps inland to warn Top Hat, Warrior, and O.J. that a broken log jam was headed toward them (propelled by an explosion of dynamite, kudos to Billy Shoepack). He was voiced by John Baddeley. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Hideyuki Umezu. In Salty's Lighthouse, Puffa was simply just referred to as \\"The Train\\" for most of the time. In one episode, however, he was briefly referred to as Chooch. Here, he was voiced by Paul Dobson. The Goods Engine The Goods Engine was a tank engine that made several brief appearances, most notably in \\"High Tide\\". Like the parts of Puffa, those of the Goods Engine were later recycled to serve as props for rusty, old steam engines seen at scrap yards in Thomas and Friends. The Buoys There are several bell buoys across Bigg City Port, most of them yellow. Notably, one appeared very briefly in \\"Pirate\\", having been 'silenced' by the pirates in order to make their escape, and getting bumped into by Warrior when he was working with Top Hat to catch the thief. The buoy was voiced by Shaun Prendergast. In the Japanese dub, he was voiced by Y≈´ko Mita. In the episode \\"Jinxed\\", a \\"Wreck\\" Buoy appeared very briefly, as well as when Ten Cents hoots his whistle to test the Jinx, a nearby marker buoy (\\"Dem-Der\\") sinks. This was the only appearance of these two buoys.

China roughly yields 60% of global production of cement. In 2017 China produced 2,400,000 metric tons of cement where as other countries produce cement about 1,728,300 metric tons of cement. Producing large amounts of cement also causes several problems such as producing one ton of cement emits one ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). To heat a cement kiln with waste requires about three times as much waste as coal, and can reduce emissions by around 10%, according to engineering company FLSmidth. Apart from this, the Chinese cement industry has already made improvements in energy efficiency. In 2017, it accounted for 57% of the global industry's output but only 52% of its emissions. However, emissions reductions from energy efficiency measures are tiny compared to those that could be achieved with innovative technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), which sequesters emissions.

Danum is the Roman name for Doncaster. Admissions It is for ages 11‚Äì18. The academy is split into two sites; the Main School which caters for the students in Years 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 on Armthorpe Road and the Sixth Form Centre which educates Years 12 and 13 on Leger Way. The main school site is next to the A18. History =Grammar schools= Doncaster Technical High School for Girls became Doncaster Technical Grammar School for Girls in the early 1960s, later becoming Danum Grammar School for Girls on Danum Road. Doncaster Technical High School for Boys on Greyfriars Road moved to Armthorpe Road in the 1950s, and had a similar name change to the girls' school. Edward Semper, the headmaster of the boys' schools, was one of the UK's leading proponents of specialist technical schools.University Technical Colleges The Danum Grammar School for Boys (c.500 boys) and Danum Grammar School for Girls merged in 1970 to form the co- educational selective Danum Grammar School. It had a technical bias, similar to a technical school. At the same time Doncaster Grammar School had merged with its analogous female school. The school was administered by the County Borough of Doncaster Education Committee and had around 800 boys and girls. =Comprehensive= In 1978 Danum Grammar School became the comprehensive Danum School, merging with Intake High School, located on Leger Way. Doncaster Grammar School became a comprehensive five years later in 1983. Technical College Campus (2007) Danum School gained Technology College status in 2002, and changed its name to reflect its new specialism. =Academy= On 1 September 2011 Danum School Technology College formally gained academy status, and changed its name to Danum Academy.

The park was established in 1981. Over 400 varieties of roses are grown there, many of them gifts from countries around the world. The Wohl Rose Park covers . It is one of the few rose parks of its kind in the Middle East, where there is no rainfall in summer.Wohl Rose Park The park's Garden of Nations is made up of sections donated by other countries. Each section has rose varieties characteristic of, or grown in, the respective country. The park also has an experimental section where new varieties of roses are tested for their suitability for public and private gardens in Israel. In October 2003, the Wohl Rose Park won an award for excellence in an international competition for rose gardens from all over the world. The park was proclaimed one of the eleven most beautiful rose gardens in the world. In addition to some 15,000 rose bushes, the park features expansive lawns, hills, quarries, an ornamental pond with aquatic plants and fish, a waterfall, rockeries, and sculptures.Award for excellence A sixth- century mosaic floor unearthed at Kibbutz Sde Nahum was installed in the park.History of Jerusalem's Rose Park The Knesset Menorah is located outside the park, facing the Knesset. Due to the park's location opposite the Prime Minister's Office and other government buildings, it is a choice site for Israeli demonstrators: The garden often hosts tent cities of protesters, with tables for petition signing, banners and placards.The Frying Pan and the Fire, Eretz Magazine History The original design for the park was drawn up in 1949. In its early years, the park was only used for official government ceremonies. It opened to the general public towards the end of the 1950s. It was known at the time as President's Park. In 1978-1979, David Gilad of the Israel Flower Board was looking for a location for a rose park that would be the focal point of the international rose congress that was to convene in Israel in October 1981. President's Park was deemed an appropriate site due to its unique location and panoramic views. The park was re-landscaped by landscape architect Joseph Segal. The project was carried out in cooperation with the Jerusalem Foundation under the sponsorship of Vivienne and Maurice Wohl. Planting goals When selecting the rose varieties, one of the goals was to show different groups of roses: Species roses - the original species from which varieties were bred 300 years ago; Old Garden Roses - the products of early breeding of roses; and modern roses such as Hybrid tea roses, Floribunda, Polyanthas, miniature roses, rose shrubs, and modern climbers. Another goal was to demonstrate various garden possibilities: Blossoming swathes of color, roses climbing up pergolas and pillars, \\"sculpted\\" rose shrubs, rambling roses, standards roses, roses with decorative fruit, hedges made up of rose bushes, and more.Rose Varieties in the Park See also * White House Rose Garden * International Rose Test Garden References Category:Parks in Jerusalem Category:Rose gardens ","title":"Wohl Rose Park"},{"id":"20128163","text":"Sutton Park railway station was a railway station in Sutton Coldfield, Warwickshire, (in Birmingham since 1974), England, on the Midland Railway's Sutton Park Line.

India‚ÄìJapan relations have traditionally been strong. The people of India and Japan have engaged in cultural exchanges, primarily as a result of Buddhism, which spread indirectly from India to Japan, via China and Korea. The people of India and Japan are guided by common cultural traditions including the heritage of Buddhism and share a strong commitment to the ideals of democracy, tolerance, pluralism and open societies. India and Japan, two of the largest and oldest democracies in Asia, having a high degree of congruence of political, economic and strategic interests, view each other as partners that have responsibility for, and are capable of, responding to global and regional challenges. India is the largest recipient of Japanese aid and both country have a special relationship official development assistance (ODA). As of 2017, bilateral trade between India and Japan stood at US$17.63 billion. The British occupiers of India and Japan were enemies during World War II, but political relations between the two nations have remained warm since India's independence. Japanese companies, such as Yamaha, Sony, Toyota, and Honda have manufacturing facilities in India. With the growth of the Indian economy, India is a big market for Japanese firms. Japanese firms were some of the first firms to invest in India. The most prominent Japanese company to have an investment in India is automobiles multinational Suzuki, which is in partnership with Indian automobiles company Maruti Suzuki, the largest car manufacturer in the Indian market, and a subsidiary of the Japanese company. In December 2006, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Japan culminated in the signing of the \\"Joint Statement Towards Japan-India Strategic and Global Partnership\\". Japan has helped finance many infrastructure projects in India, most notably the Delhi Metro system. Indian applicants were welcomed in 2006 to the JET Programme, with one slot available in 2006 and increasing to 41 slots in 2007. In 2007, the Japanese Self-Defence Forces and the Indian Navy took part in a joint naval exercise Malabar 2007 in the Indian Ocean, which also involved the naval forces of Australia, Singapore and the United States. 2007 was declared \\"India-Japan Friendship Year.\\" According to a 2013 BBC World Service Poll, 42% Japanese think India's international impact is mainly positive, with 4% considering it negative.  Historical relations  Though Hinduism is a little-practiced religion in Japan, it has still had a significant, but indirect role in the formation of Japanese culture. This is mostly because many Buddhist beliefs and traditions (which share a common Dharmic root with Hinduism) spread to Japan from China via Korean peninsula in the 6th Century. One indication of this is the Japanese \\"Seven Gods of Fortune\\", of which four originated as Hindu deities: Benzaitensama (Sarasvati), Bishamon (Vai≈õrava·πáa or Kubera), Daikokuten (MahƒÅkƒÅla/Shiva), and Kichij≈çten (Lakshmi). Along with Benzaitennyo/Sarasvati and Kisshoutennyo/Laxmi and completing the nipponization of the three Hindu Tridevi goddesses, the Hindu goddess Mahakali is nipponized as the Japanese goddess Daikokutennyo (Â§ßÈªíÂ§©Â•≥), though she is only counted among Japan's Seven Luck Deities when she is regarded as the feminine manifestation of her male counterpart Daikokuten (Â§ßÈªíÂ§©). Benzaiten arrived in Japan during the 6th through 8th centuries, mainly via the Chinese translations of the Sutra of Golden Light (ÈáëÂÖâÊòéÁµå), which has a section devoted to her. She is also mentioned in the Lotus Sutra. In Japan, the lokapƒÅlas take the Buddhist form of the Four Heavenly Kings (ÂõõÂ§©Áéã). The Sutra of Golden Light became one of the most important sutras in Japan because of its fundamental message, which teaches that the Four Heavenly Kings protect the ruler who governs his country in the proper manner. The Hindu god of death, Yama, is known in his Buddhist form as Enma. Garuda, the mount (vahana) of Vishnu, is known as the Karura (Ëø¶Ê•ºÁæÖ), an enormous, fire-breathing creature in Japan. It has the body of a human and the face or beak of an eagle. Tennin originated from the apsaras. The Hindu Ganesha (see Kangiten) is displayed more than Buddha in a temple in Futako Tamagawa, Tokyo. Other examples of Hindu influence on Japan include the belief of \\"six schools\\" or \\"six doctrines\\" as well as use of Yoga and pagodas. Many of the facets of Hindu culture which have influenced Japan have also influenced Chinese culture. People have written books on the worship of Hindu gods in Japan.Chaudhuri, Saroj Kumar. Hindu Gods and Goddesses in Japan. (New Delhi, 2003) . Even today, it is claimed Japan encourages a deeper study of Hindu gods.\\"Japan wants to encourage studies of Hindu gods\\" Satyen Mohapatra =Buddhism= Buddhism has been practiced in Japan since its official introduction in 552 CE according to the Nihon Shoki from Baekje, Korea by Buddhist monks. Although some Chinese sources place the first spreading of the religion earlier during the Kofun period (250 to 538). Buddhism has had a major influence on the development of Japanese society and remains an influential aspect of the culture to this day.Asia Society Buddhism in Japan, accessed July 2012 Great Buddha (Vairocana) T≈çdai-ji temple, Japan Benzaiten, one of the Seven Gods of Fortune in Japan, evolved from the Indian deity Saraswati. Subhas Chandra Bose addressing a rally in Tokyo, 1943. Cultural exchanges between India and Japan began early in the 6th century with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan from India. The Indian monk Bodhisena arrived in Japan in 736 to spread Buddhism and performed eye-opening of the Great Buddha built in T≈çdai-ji, and would remain in Japan until his death in 760. Buddhism and the intrinsically linked Indian culture had a great impact on Japanese culture, still felt today, and resulted in a natural sense of amiability between the two nations. As a result of the link of Buddhism between India and Japan, monks and scholars often embarked on voyages between the two nations. Ancient records from the now- destroyed library at Nalanda University in India describe scholars and pupils who attended the school from Japan. One of the most famous Japanese travellers to the Indian subcontinent was Tenjiku Tokubei (1612‚Äì1692), named after Tenjiku (\\"Heavenly Abode\\"), the Japanese name for India. The cultural exchanges between the two countries created many parallels in their folklore. Modern popular culture based upon this folklore, such as works of fantasy fiction in manga and anime, sometimes bear references to common deities (deva), demons (asura) and philosophical concepts. The Indian goddess Saraswati for example, is known as Benzaiten in Japan. Brahma, known as 'Bonten', and Yama, known as 'Enma', are also part of the traditional Japanese Buddhist pantheon. In addition to the common Buddhist influence on the two societies, Shintoism, being an animist religion, is similar to the animist strands of Hinduism, in contrast to the religions present in the rest of the world, which are monotheistic. Sanskrit, a classical language used in Buddhism and Hinduism, is still used by some ancient Chinese priests who immigrated to Japan, and the Siddha·πÉ script is still written to this day, despite having passed out of usage in India. It is also thought that the distinctive torii gateways at temples in Japan, may be related to the torana gateways used in Indian temples. In the 16th century, Japan established political contact with Portuguese colonies in India. The Japanese initially assumed that the Portuguese were from India and that Christianity was a new \\"Indian faith\\". These mistaken assumptions were due to the Indian city of Goa being a central base for the Portuguese East India Company and also due to a significant portion of the crew on Portuguese ships being Indian Christians. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, Indian lascar seamen frequently visited Japan as crew members aboard Portuguese ships, and later aboard British ships in the 18th and 19th centuries. During the anti-Christian persecutions in 1596, many Japanese Christians fled to the Portuguese colony of Goa in India. By the early 17th century, there was a community of Japanese traders in Goa in addition to Japanese slaves brought by Portuguese ships from Japan. Relations between the two nations have continued since then, but direct political exchange began only in the Meiji era (1868‚Äì1912), when Japan embarked on the process of modernisation. Japan-India Association was founded in 1903. Further cultural exchange occurred during the mid-late 20th century through Asian cinema, with Indian cinema and Japanese cinema both experiencing a \\"golden age\\" during the 1950s and 1960s. Indian films by Satyajit Ray, Guru Dutt were influential in Japan, while Japanese films by Akira Kurosawa, Yasujir≈ç Ozu and Takashi Shimizu have likewise been influential in India.  Indian Independence Movement  A dinner party given to Rash Behari Bose (The second from the right) in his honour by his close Japanese friends, Mitsuru T≈çyama, a Pan-Asianism leader (centre, behind the table), and Tsuyoshi Inukai, future Japanese prime minister (to the right of T≈çyama). 1915. Sureshchandra Bandopadhyay, Manmatha Nath Ghosh and Hariprova Takeda were among the earliest Indians who visited Japan and had written on their experiences there. Correspondences between distinguished individuals from both nations had a noticeable increase at the time; historical documents show a friendship between Japanese thinker Okakura Tenshin and Indian writer Rabindranath Tagore, Okakura Tenshin and Bengali poet Priyamvada Banerjee. As part of the British Empire, many Indians resented the British rule. G. N. Potdar (aka Govindrao Potdar) established an organization called Indo-Japanese Association in 1904 with the help of a Japanese gentleman Mr. Sakurai, for helping the Indian expatriates in Japan.Source Material for a History of the Freedom Movement in India: 1885-1920, Government Central Press, 1958.The Japan Daily Mail, Volume 45, 1906. The Anglo-Japanese Alliance was ended on 17 August 1923. As a result, during the two World Wars, the INA adopted the \\"an enemy of our enemy is our friend\\" attitude, legacy that is still controversial today given the war crimes committed by Imperial Japan and its allies. Many Indian independence movement activists escaped from British rule and stayed in Japan. The leader of the Indian Independence Movement, Rash Behari Bose created India‚ÄìJapan relations. Future prime minister Tsuyoshi Inukai, pan-Asianist Mitsuru T≈çyama and other Japanese supported the Indian Independence movement. A. M. Nair, a student from India, became an Independence Movement activist. Nair supported Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose during the war and Justice Radha Binod Pal after the war. In 1899 Tokyo Imperial University set up a chair in Sanskrit and Pali, with a further chair in Comparative religion being set up in 1903. In this environment, a number of Indian students came to Japan in the early twentieth century, founding the Oriental Youngmen's Association in 1900. Their anti-British political activity caused consternation to the Indian Government, following a report in the London Spectator.  Before World War II  In 1934, \\"Indo-Japanese Trade Agreement of 1934\\" was signed in Delhi on 5 January 1934 and went effective on 12 July 1934. In 1937, \\"Indo-Japanese Trade Agreement of 1937\\" went effective on 1 April 1937, for three (3) years, until 31 March 1940.  During World War II  Since India was under British rule when World War II broke out, it was deemed to have entered the war on the side of the Allies. Over 2 million Indians participated in the war; many served in combat against the Japanese who conquered Burma and reached the Indian border. Some 67,000 Indian soldiers were captured by the Japanese when Singapore surrendered in 1942, many of whom later became part of the Japanese sponsored Indian National Army (INA). In 1944‚Äì45, combined British and Indian forces defeated the Japanese in a series of battles in Burma and the INA disintegrated. = Indian National Army = Major Iwaichi Fujiwara of Japan greets Captain Mohan Singh of the First Indian National Army, April 1942 Subhas Chandra Bose, who led the Azad Hind, a nationalist movement which aimed to end the British Raj in India through military means, used Japanese sponsorship to form the Azad Hind Fauj or Indian National Army (INA). The INA was composed mainly of former prisoners of war from the British Indian Army who had been captured by the Japanese after the fall of Singapore. They joined primarily because of the very harsh, often fatal conditions in POW camps. The INA also recruited volunteers from Indian expatriates in Southeast Asia. Bose was eager for the INA to participate in any invasion of India, and persuaded several Japanese that a victory such as Mutaguchi anticipated would lead to the collapse of British rule in India. The idea that their western boundary would be controlled by a more friendly government was attractive. Japan never expected India to be part of its Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.Joyce C. Lebra, Jungle Alliance, Japan and the Indian National Army (1971) p 20 The Japanese Government built, supported and controlled the Indian National Army and the Indian Independence League. Japanese forces included INA units in many battles, most notably at the U Go Offensive at Manipur. The offensive culminated in Battles of Imphal and Kohima where the Japanese forces were pushed back and the INA lost cohesion.  Modern relations  Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shinzo Abe during a tea ceremony at Akasaka Palace in 2014 The Emperor of Japan, His Majesty Akihito with the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, in Tokyo, Japan in 2014. At the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, Indian Justice Radhabinod Pal became famous for his dissenting judgement in favour of Japan. The judgement of Justice Radhabinod Pal is remembered even today in Japan. This became a symbol of the close ties between India and Japan. A relatively well-known result of the two nations' was in 1949, when India sent the Tokyo Zoo two elephants to cheer the spirits of the defeated Japanese empire. India refused to attend the San Francisco Peace Conference in 1951 due to its concerns over limitations imposed upon Japanese sovereignty and national independence. After the restoration of Japan's sovereignty, Japan and India signed a peace treaty, establishing official diplomatic relations on 28 April 1952, in which India waived all reparation claims against Japan. This treaty was one of the first treaties Japan signed after World War II. Diplomatic, trade, economic, and technical relations between India and Japan were well established. India's iron ore helped Japan's recovery from World War II devastation, and following Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's visit to India in 1957, Japan started providing yen loans to India in 1958, as the first yen loan aid extended by Japanese government. In India, there was great admiration for Japan's post-war economic reconstruction and subsequent rapid growth. Relations between the two nations were constrained, however, by Cold War politics. Japan, as a result of World War II reconstruction, was a U.S. ally, whereas India pursued a non- aligned foreign policy, often leaning towards the Soviet Union. Since the 1980s, however, efforts were made to strengthen bilateral ties. India's ‚ÄòLook East‚Äô policy posited Japan as a key partner. Since 1986, Japan has become India's largest aid donor, and remains so. Relations between the two nations reached a brief low in 1998 as a result of Pokhran-II, an Indian nuclear weapons test that year. Japan imposed sanctions on India following the test, which included the suspension of all political exchanges and the cutting off economic assistance. These sanctions were lifted three years later. Relations improved exponentially following this period, as bilateral ties between the two nations improved once again, to the point where the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe was to be the chief guest at India's 2014 Republic Day parade. In 2014, the Indian PM Narendra Modi visited Japan. During his tenure as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi had maintained good ties with the Japanese PM Shinzo Abe. His 2014 visit further strengthened the ties between the two countries, and resulted in several key agreements, including the establishment of a \\"Special Strategic Global Partnership\\". Modi visited Japan for the second time as Prime Minister in November 2016. During the meeting, India and Japan signed the \\"Agreement for Cooperation in Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy\\", a landmark civil nuclear agreement, under which Japan will supply nuclear reactors, fuel and technology to India. India is not a signatory to the non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and is the only non-signatory to receive an exemption from Japan. The two sides also signed agreements on manufacturing skill development in India, cooperation in space, earth sciences, agriculture, forestry and fisheries, transport and urban development. Yogendra Puranik , popularly known as Yogi, became the first elected India-born City Councillor in Japan, to represent the City Council of Edogawa City in Tokyo. His victory was well received by the mass public and media, not just in India and Japan but across the globe including China. = Economic = In August 2000, the Japanese Prime Minister visited India. At this meeting, Japan and India agreed to establish \\"Japan-India Global Partnership in the 21st Century.\\" Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee visited Japan in December, 2001, where both Prime Ministers issued \\"Japan-India Joint Declaration.\\" In April, 2005, Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi visited India and signed Joint Statement \\"Japan-India Partnership in the New Asian Era: Strategic Orientation of Japan-India Global Partnership.\\" Japan is the 3rd largest investor in the Indian economy with cumulative FDI inflows of $30.27 bn during 2000-2019, contributing 7.2% to India's total FDI inflows during the same period. The imports to India from Japan stood at $12.77 bn in 2018-19, making it India's 14th largest import partner. In October 2008, Japan signed an agreement with India under which it would provide the latter a low-interest loan worth US$4.5 billion to construct a railway project between Delhi and Mumbai. This is the single largest overseas project being financed by Japan and reflected growing economic partnership between the two nations. India is also one of the only three countries in the world with whom Japan has a security pact. As of March 2006, Japan was the third largest investor in India. Kenichi Yoshida, a director of Softbridge Solutions Japan, stated in late 2009 that Indian engineers were becoming the backbone of Japan's IT industry and that \\"it is important for Japanese industry to work together with India\\". Under the memorandum, any Japanese coming to India for business or work will be straightway granted a three-year visa and similar procedures will be followed by Japan. Other highlights of this visit includes abolition of customs duties on 94 per cent of trade between the two nations over the next decade. As per the Agreement, tariffs will be removed on almost 90 per cent of Japan's exports to India and 97 per cent of India's exports to Japan Trade between the two nations has also steadily been growing. India and Japan signed an agreement in December 2015 to build a bullet train line between Mumbai and Ahmedabad using Japan's Shinkansen technology, with a loan from Japan of ¬£12bn. More than four-fifths of the project‚Äôs $19bn (¬£14.4bn) cost will be funded by a 0.1% interest-rate loan from Japan as part of a deepening economic relationship. = Military = Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force and Indian Navy warships took part in the Malabar 2007 naval exercises off India's western coast, one of the many such multilateral exercises Japan has taken part in symbolising close military co-operation between India and Japan. Indian Defence Minister calling on the Prime Minister of Japan in Tokyo in September 2019 India and Japan also have close military ties. They have shared interests in maintaining the security of sea-lanes in the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean, and in co-operation for fighting international crime, terrorism, piracy and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The two nations have frequently held joint military exercises and co-operate on technology. India and Japan concluded a security pact on 22 October 2008. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is seen by some to be an \\"Indophile\\" and, with rising tensions in territorial disputes with Japan's neighbors, has advocated closer security cooperation with India.Japan and India Bolster Trade and Defense Ties TIME In July 2014, the Indian Navy participated in Exercise Malabar with the Japanese and US navies, reflecting shared perspectives on Indo-Pacific maritime security. India is also negotiating to purchase US-2 amphibious aircraft for the Indian Navy. = Cultural = Indian PM Narendra Modi in a music class at the Taimei Elementary School, Tokyo Japan and India have strong cultural ties, based mainly on Japanese Buddhism, which remains widely practiced through Japan even today. The two nations announced 2007, the 50th anniversary year of Indo-Japan Cultural Agreement, as the Indo-Japan Friendship and Tourism-Promotion Year, holding cultural events in both the countries. One such cultural event is the annual Namaste India Festival, which started in Japan over twenty years ago and is now the largest festival of its kind in the world. At the 2016 festival, representatives from Onagawa town performed, as a sign of appreciation for the support the town received from the Indian Government during the Great East Japan Earthquake. The Indian National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team had been dispatched in Onagawa for its first overseas mission and conducted search and rescue operations for missing people. Osamu Tezuka wrote a biographical manga Buddha from 1972 to 1983. On 10 April 2006, a Japanese delegation proposed to raise funds and provide other support for rebuilding the world-famous ancient Nalanda University, an ancient Buddhist centre of learning in Bihar, into a major international institution of education. Tamil movies are very popular in Japan and Rajnikanth is the most popular Indian star in this country.

Starting 3 July 2014, Japan has been issuing multiple entry visas for the short term stay of Indian nationals. =2016 nuclear deal= In November 2016, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on a three-day visit to Japan signed a deal with his counterpart Shinzo Abe on nuclear energy. The deal took six years to negotiate, delayed in part by the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. This is the first time that Japan signed such deal with a non-signatory of Non-Proliferation Treaty. The deal gives Japan the right to supply nuclear reactors, fuel and technology to India. This deal aimed to help India build the six nuclear reactors in southern India, increasing nuclear energy capacity ten-fold by 2032. =Development= In August 2017, the two countries announced the establishment of the Japan-India Coordination Forum (JICF) for Development of North-Eastern Region, described by India as \\"a coordination forum to identify priority development areas of cooperation for development\\" of northeast India. The forum will focus on strategic projects aimed at improving connectivity, roads, electric infrastructure, food processing, disaster management, and promoting organic farming and tourism in northeast India. A Japanese embassy spokesperson stated that the development of the northeast was a \\"priority\\" for India and its Act East Policy, and that Japan placed a \\"special emphasis on cooperation in North East for its geographical importance connecting India to South-East Asia and historical ties\\". The forum held its first meeting on 3 August 2017.

It is written in the voice of 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives in the future, post-apocalyptic nation of Panem in North America. The Capitol, a highly advanced metropolis, exercises political control over the rest of the nation. The Hunger Games is an annual event in which one boy and one girl aged 12‚Äì18 from each of the twelve districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to compete in a televised battle royale to the death. The book received critical acclaim from major reviewers and authors. It was praised for its plot and character development. In writing The Hunger Games, Collins drew upon Greek mythology, Roman gladiatorial games, and contemporary reality television for thematic content. The novel won many awards, including the California Young Reader Medal, and was named one of Publishers Weeklys \\"Best Books of the Year\\" in 2008. The Hunger Games was first published in hardcover on September 14, 2008, by Scholastic, featuring a cover designed by Tim O'Brien. It has since been released in paperback and also as an audiobook and ebook. After an initial print of 200,000, the book had sold 800,000 copies by February 2010. Since its release, The Hunger Games has been translated into 26 languages, and publishing rights have been sold in 38 territories. The novel is the first in The Hunger Games trilogy, followed by Catching Fire (2009) and Mockingjay (2010). A film adaptation, directed by Gary Ross and co-written and co-produced by Collins herself, was released in 2012. Background Collins has said that the inspiration for The Hunger Games came from channel surfing on television. On one channel she observed people competing on a reality show and on another she saw footage of the invasion of Iraq. The two \\"began to blur in this very unsettling way\\" and the idea for the book was formed. The Greek myth of Theseus served as a major basis for the story, with Collins describing Katniss as a futuristic Theseus, and Roman gladiatorial games provided the framework. The sense of loss that Collins developed through her father's service in the Vietnam War was also an influence on the story, with Katniss having lost her father at age 11, five years before the story begins. Collins stated that the deaths of young characters and other \\"dark passages\\" were the most difficult parts of the book to write, but that she had accepted that passages such as these were necessary to the story. She considered the moments where Katniss reflects on happier moments in her past to be more enjoyable. Plot In the nation of Panem, established in the remains of North America after an unspecified apocalyptic event, the wealthy Capitol exploits the twelve surrounding districts for their natural resources and labour.Blasingame, James. \\"The Hunger Games.\\" Journal of Adolescent & Adult Literacy, vol. 52, no. 8, 2009, p. 724+. Academic OneFile, Accessed 6 Dec. 2016. District 12 is in the coal-rich region that was once Appalachia, while the Capitol west of the Rocky Mountains. As punishment for a past failed rebellion against the Capitol, which resulted in the obliteration of District 13, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each of the 12 remaining districts are selected by an annual lottery to participate in the Hunger Games, a contest in which the \\"tributes\\" must fight to the death in an outdoor arena until only one remains. The story is narrated by 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen from District 12, who volunteers for the 74th Hunger Games in place of her 12-year-old sister, Primrose. The male tribute is Peeta Mellark, a former schoolmate of Katniss who once gave her bread from his family's bakery when her family was starving. In the days leading up to the Games in the Capitol, they are given advice by their drunken mentor, Haymitch Abernathy, the sole living District 12 victor of the Hunger Games; chaperone Effie Trinket; and various stylists to enhance their public perception to get potential sponsors, who will send potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. Katniss's stylist, Cinna, designed special costumes for Katniss and Peeta that set them apart from the tributes when introduced to the public. Due to Katniss‚Äô dress, which had the theme of fire, she became known as the ‚ÄúGirl on Fire‚Äù. During their evaluation by the Gamemakers, Katniss unexpectedly gets the highest score among the others. Meanwhile, Rue, the petite 12-year-old girl tribute from District 11, follows Katniss and Peeta around during the training sessions. On the day before the games, in the televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta reveals his long-unrequited love for Katniss; she is initially shocked by this and believes this is a ploy to gain sponsors, but later accepts this as sincere. Haymitch then promotes their image as \\"star-crossed lovers\\". The Games begin, and nearly half the tributes are killed in the bloodbath at the start, fighting over the weapons and supplies throughout the arena. Katniss disregards Haymitch's earlier advice to flee immediately and nearly dies, but uses her well-practiced hunting and survival skills to hide in the woods. After a few days, an artificial fire drives Katniss toward the others. She is spotted and treed by the \\"Career tributes‚Äú mainly from Districts 1, 2, and 4, and Peeta, who seems to have allied with them. Rue, hiding in a nearby tree, silently alerts Katniss to a ‚Äútracker jacker‚Äù nest, which she sends it plummeting down, releasing the flying insects who are genetically modified to track whoever disturbs their nest and have venom that targets the section of their victims‚Äô minds that houses fear. Their venom kills one of the careers and drives the others away, but Katniss is stung and begins hallucinating. Peeta returns, but instead of killing her, tells her to run away. Katniss later forms an alliance with Rue, but Rue is fatally wounded by the male tribute from district 1 while Katniss destroys the careers' supplies. Katniss kills Rue's killer with an arrow, and accompanies Rue as she dies and spreads flowers over the body to show her defiance against the Capitol. In gratitude, Rue's district sends Katniss a loaf of bread. A rule change is announced, allowing the tributes from the same district to win as a pair. Katniss finds and nurses a wounded Peeta (who later revealed that he formed an alliance with the careers to protect Katniss), acting the part of a girl in love to gain gifts. When the Gamemakers send a delivery of what each contestant needs most, Katniss risks her life to obtain medicine for Peeta. She is intercepted by a career tribute Clove, who gloats over Rue's death and tries to kill Katniss, but is killed by Thresh, the male District 11 tribute, who spares Katniss for Rue's sake. The medicine saves Peeta's life, and they both spend time hunting and collecting food. Katniss and Peeta become the last two survivors, but the Gamemakers revoke the rule change to force one to kill the other for a dramatic finale. In defiance, Katniss prepares to consume the poisonous \\"nightlock\\" berries with Peeta. Realizing they intend to commit suicide so that there will not be a victor for the games, the Gamemakers declare Katniss and Peeta the victors. Although both of them receive a hero's welcome as a couple, Katniss is warned by Haymitch that the Capitol may take action against her for her defiance. Along the way back to District 12, Peeta is heartbroken to learn that Katniss' actions were part of a calculated ploy to gain sympathy. Katniss, however, is unsure of her own feelings and her future. Themes The Hunger Games author Suzanne Collins in 2010 In an interview with Collins, it was noted that the novel \\"tackles issues like severe poverty, starvation, oppression, and the effects of war among others.\\" The novel deals with the struggle for self-preservation that the people of Panem face in their districts and the Hunger Games in which they must participate. The citizens' starvation and their need for resources, both in and outside of the arena, create an atmosphere of helplessness that the main characters try to overcome in their fight for survival. Katniss needs to hunt to provide food for her family, resulting in the development of skills that are useful to her in the Games (such as her proficiency with the bow and arrow), and represents her rejection of the Capitol's rules in the face of life-threatening situations. On the subject of the Games' parallels with popular culture, Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly writes that the book \\"is an incisive satire of reality television shows\\", and that the character of Cinna \\"almost seems like a contestant on a fascist version of Project Runway, using Katniss' outfits as a vehicle to express potentially dangerous ideas.\\" The choices the characters make and the strategies they use are often morally complex. The tributes build a personality they want the audience to see throughout the Games. Library journal Voice of Youth Advocates names the major themes of The Hunger Games as \\"government control, 'big brother', and personal independence.\\" The trilogy's theme of power and downfall, similar to that of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, was pointed out by its publisher Scholastic. Laura Miller of The New Yorker finds the author's stated premise of the Games ‚Äìan exercise in propaganda and a \\"humiliating as well as torturous [...] punishment\\" for a failed uprising against the Capitol many years earlier‚Äì to be unconvincing. \\"You don't demoralize and dehumanize a subject people by turning them into celebrities and coaching them on how to craft an appealing persona for a mass audience.\\" But the story works much better if the theme is vicissitudes of high school and \\"the adolescent social experience\\". Miller writes: > \\"The rules are arbitrary, unfathomable, and subject to sudden change. A > brutal social hierarchy prevails, with the rich, the good-looking, and the > athletic lording their advantages over everyone else. To survive you have to > be totally fake. Adults don't seem to understand how high the stakes are; > your whole life could be over, and they act like it's just some \\"phase\\"! > Everyone's always watching you, scrutinizing your clothes or your friends > and obsessing over whether you're having sex or taking drugs or getting good > enough grades, but no one cares who you really are or how you really feel > about anything.\\" Donald Brake from The Washington Times and pastor Andy Langford state that the story has Christian themes, such as that of self-sacrifice, which is found in Katniss' substitution for her younger sister, analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus as a substitute for the atonement of sins. Brake, as well as another reviewer, Amy Simpson, both find that the story also revolves around the theme of hope, which is exemplified in the \\"incorruptible goodness of Katniss' sister, Primrose.\\" Simpson also points to events similar to the Passion of Jesus; in the Games, \\"Christ figure\\" Peeta Mellark is stabbed after warning Katniss to flee for her life, and is then buried in the ground and placed in a cave for three days before emerging with a new lease on life. Further, she finds that the Christian image of the Bread of Life is used throughout The Hunger Games; in the story, Peeta gives Katniss a loaf of bread, saving the girl and her family from starvation. Publication history After writing the novel, Collins signed a six-figure deal for three books with Scholastic. First published as a hardcover in the United States on September 14, 2008, The Hunger Games had a first printing of 50,000 copies, which was bumped up twice to 200,000 copies. By February 2010, the book had sold 800,000 copies, and rights to the novel had been sold in 38 territories worldwide. A few months later, in July, the book was released in paperback. The Hunger Games entered the New York Times Best Seller list in November 2008, where it would feature for over 100 consecutive weeks. By the time the film adaptation of The Hunger Games was released in March 2012, the book had been on USA Todays best-sellers list for 135 consecutive weeks and has sold over 17.5 million copies. The novel is the first in The Hunger Games trilogy; it is followed by sequels Catching Fire (2009) and Mockingjay (2010). In March 2012, during the time of The Hunger Games film's release, Scholastic reported 26 million Hunger Games trilogy books in print, including movie tie-in books. The Hunger Games (and its sequels) have sold exceptionally well in ebook format. Suzanne Collins is the first children's or young adult author to sell over one million Amazon Kindle ebooks, making her the sixth author to join the \\"Kindle Million Club\\". In March 2012, Amazon announced that Collins had become the best-selling Kindle ebook author of all time. An audiobook version of The Hunger Games was released in December 2008. Read by the actress Carolyn McCormick, it has a total running time of eleven hours and fourteen minutes. The magazine AudioFile said: \\"Carolyn McCormick gives a detailed and attentive narration. However, she may rely too much on the strength of the prose without providing the drama young adult listeners often enjoy.\\" School Library Journal also praised the audiobook, stating that \\"McCormick ably voices the action-packed sequences and Katniss's every fear and strength shines through, along with her doomed growing attraction to one of her fellow Tributes.\\" The Tim O'Brien- designed cover features a gold \\"mockingjay\\" ‚Äì a fictional bird in The Hunger Games born by crossbreeding female mockingbirds and genetically engineered male \\"jabberjays\\" ‚Äì with an arrow engraved in a circle. This is a depiction of the pin worn by Katniss into the arena, given to her by the District 12 mayor's daughter, Madge Undersee. The image matches the description of the pin that is given in the novel, except for the arrow: \\"It's as if someone fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ring around it. The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips.\\" Critical reception The Hunger Games has received critical acclaim. In a review for The New York Times, John Green wrote that the novel was \\"brilliantly plotted and perfectly paced\\", and that \\"the considerable strength of the novel comes in Collins's convincingly detailed world-building and her memorably complex and fascinating heroine.\\" However, he also noted that, while allegorically rich, the book sometimes does not realize the allegorical potential that the plot has to offer and that the writing \\"described the action and little else.\\" Time magazine's review was also positive, stating that it \\"is a chilling, bloody and thoroughly horrifying book\\" and praising what it called the \\"hypnotic\\" quality of the violence. In Stephen King's review for Entertainment Weekly, he compared it to \\"shoot-it-if-it-moves videogames in the lobby of the local eightplex; you know it's not real, but you keep plugging in quarters anyway.\\" However, he stated that there were \\"displays of authorial laziness that kids will accept more readily than adults\\" and that the love triangle was standard for the genre. He gave the book a B grade. Elizabeth Bird of School Library Journal praised the novel, saying it is \\"exciting, poignant, thoughtful, and breathtaking by turns\\", and called it one of the best books of 2008. Booklist also gave a positive review, praising the character violence and romance involved in the book. Kirkus Reviews gave a positive review, praising the action and world-building, but pointed out that \\"poor copyediting in the first printing will distract careful readers‚Äìa crying shame\\". Rick Riordan, author of the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series, claims it is the \\"closest thing to a perfect adventure novel\\" he has ever read. Stephenie Meyer (author of the Twilight series) endorsed the book on her website, saying, \\"I was so obsessed with this book ... The Hunger Games is amazing.\\" The Hunger Games received many awards and honors. It was named one of Publishers Weekly \\"Best Books of the Year\\" in 2008 and a The New York Times \\"Notable Children's Book of 2008\\". It was the 2009 winner of the Golden Duck Award in the Young Adult Fiction Category. The Hunger Games was also a \\"2008 Cybil Winner\\" for fantasy and science-fiction books along with The Graveyard Book, one of School Library Journals \\"Best Books 2008\\", and a \\"Booklist Editors' Choice\\" in 2008. In 2011, the book won the California Young Reader Medal. In the 2012 edition of Scholastic's Parent and Child magazine, The Hunger Games was listed as the 33rd-best book for children, with the award for \\"Most Exciting Ending\\". The novel is one of the top 5 best selling Kindle books of all time. However, the novel has also been controversial with parents; it ranked in fifth place on the American Library Association's list of frequently challenged books for 2010, with \\"unsuited to age group\\" and \\"violence\\" being among the reasons cited. Similarities of The Hunger Games to Koushun Takami's 1999 novel Battle Royale have been noted. Collins stated that she \\"had never heard of that book or that author until my book was turned in. At that point, it was mentioned to me, and I asked my editor if I should read it. He said: 'No, I don't want that world in your head. Just continue with what you're doing'.\\" Susan Dominus of The New York Times reports that \\"the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff\\" of Battle Royale but argued that \\"there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently.\\" Stephen King noted that the reality TV \\"badlands\\" were similar to Battle Royale, as well as his own novels The Running Man and The Long Walk. The story has also been compared to the 1965 Italian cult film The 10th Victim by Elio Petri, based on Robert Sheckley's 1953 short story \\"Seventh Victim\\". Film adaptation In March 2009, Lions Gate Entertainment entered into a co- production agreement for The Hunger Games with Nina Jacobson's production company Color Force, which had acquired worldwide distribution rights to the novel a few weeks earlier. The studio, which had not made a profit for five years, raided the budgets of other productions and sold assets to secure a budget of $88,000,000 ‚Äì one of its largest ever ‚Äì for the film. Collins' agent Jason Dravis remarked that \\"they [Lionsgate] had everyone but the valet call us\\" to help secure the franchise. Intending the film to have a PG-13 rating, Collins adapted the novel for film herself, in collaboration with screenwriter Billy Ray and director Gary Ross. The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel, with Ross saying he \\"felt the only way to make the film really successful was to be totally subjective\\" in its presentation of events, echoing Collins' use of first person present in the novel. Twenty-year-old actress Jennifer Lawrence was chosen to play Katniss Everdeen. Though Lawrence was four years older than the character when filming began, Collins felt the role demanded \\"a certain maturity and power\\" and said she would rather the actress be older than younger. She added that Lawrence was the \\"only one who truly captured the character I wrote in the book\\" and that she had \\"every essential quality necessary to play Katniss.\\" Lawrence, a fan of the books, took three days to accept the role, initially intimidated by the size of the production. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth were later added to the cast, in the roles of Peeta and Gale, respectively. Production began in late spring 2011 and the film was released on March 23, 2012. The film's opening weekend brought in a non-sequel record $152.5 million (USD) in North America. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, based on the second novel in the series, was released the following year on November 22, 2013.

On December 23, 2008, Butts was selected by President-elect Barack Obama to serve as Deputy White House Counsel, focusing on domestic policy and ethics. She was on the advisory board for then-president-elect Barack Obama's presidential transition team. She stepped down as Deputy White House Counsel in November 2009 and served as Senior Advisor in the Office of the Chief Executive Officer at the Millennium Challenge Corporation. In February 2014, Obama nominated her to be the ambassador to the Bahamas, but by February 1, 2015, the Senate had not confirmed her to the post. She was re-nominated to the position on February 5, 2015. Biography Butts was born on August 10, 1965, in Brooklyn, New York, and at age nine moved to Durham, North Carolina. She graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and in 1991 from Harvard Law School where she was a classmate of Barack Obama and the two became close friends. Butts' first job was as a counselor at the Y.M.C.A. in Durham. From 1991-92, she worked as a fellow with the National Health Law Program (NHeLP), a nonprofit organization advocating for access to quality healthcare for low- income people. After college she worked for a year as a researcher with the African News Service in Durham. She was an election observer in the 2000 Zimbabwean parliamentary elections and counsel to Senator Harris Wofford (D-PA). She also did litigation and policy work for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc, and spent seven years working as a senior adviser to US Representative Dick Gephardt of Missouri. She became the Senior Vice President for Domestic Policy at the Center for American Progress. Deputy White House Counsel During her time as Deputy White House Counsel, Butts focused most on judicial nominations. Records later showed that in the days after Associate Justice David Souter announced his retirement from the U.S. Supreme Court, Butts was in frequent contact with President Obama's eventual nominee to replace Souter, Sonia Sotomayor. Butts also had been rumored in February 2009 to be a candidate to lead the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Millennium Challenge Corporation On November 6, 2009, Obama named Butts to serve as a senior advisor in the Office of the Chief Executive Officer of the Millennium Challenge Corporation. Butts' departure was considered to be one of the highest-level departures up to that point from the office of the White House Counsel, and it was followed one week later by the announcement of the departure of Butts' then-boss, White House Counsel Gregory Craig. Nomination to be Ambassador to the Bahamas On February 7, 2014, Butts was nominated by President Obama to be United States Ambassador to the Bahamas. The Senate held a committee hearing on her nomination in May 2014, but took no action the rest of the year, and her nomination lapsed with the end of the 113th United States Congress. With the new Congress, Obama renominated her to the post on February 5, 2015. The United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations reported her nomination to the full U.S. Senate on May 21, 2015. However, Butts' nomination was blocked by several Republican senators. First, Sen. Ted Cruz placed a blanket hold on all U.S. State Department nominees after he was upset with Obama for the Iran nuclear deal. However, after Cruz lifted those holds, Sen. Tom Cotton then stepped in and once again, to protest an issue unrelated to the specific nominees, blocked Butts' nomination and the nominations of ambassador nominees to Sweden and Norway after the Secret Service had leaked private information about a fellow member of Congress. Cotton later lifted his holds on the nominees to Sweden and Norway, but kept his hold on Butts' nomination. Butts told New York Times columnist Frank Bruni that she had visited Cotton about his objections to her nomination, and Cotton told her that because he knew that Obama and Butts were friends, blocking Butts was a way to \\"inflict special pain on the president,\\" Bruni wrote. According to Bruni's article, a spokeswoman for Cotton did not dispute Butts' account, but did emphasize Cotton's respect for Butts and for her career. Butts died on May 25, 2016, still awaiting a Senate vote. For several weeks after Butts' death, her nomination had remained pending before the U.S. Senate on its executive calendar. Obama formally withdrew her nomination on June 9, 2016. Death Butts was found dead in her Washington, D.C. home by her sister on May 25, 2016. According to a statement from her family she had suffered from a brief illness. Bruni wrote that she had suffered from acute leukemia and had not felt ill until just beforehand.

It was the terminus of a branch from Cheddington on what is now known as the West Coast Main Line running to London Euston and to Birmingham New Street and further north. Two stations were built, the first being used as a goods terminus after its closure to passengers. History The first station at Aylesbury was opened by the Aylesbury Railway on 10 June 1839; this was closed on 16 June 1889 when it was replaced by the second station, also named Aylesbury. The line was operated by the London and Birmingham Railway, and when that company amalgamated with others to form the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), the Aylesbury Railway was absorbed by the LNWR. The LNWR became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923, passing on to the London Midland Region of British Railways during the nationalisation of 1948. British Railways (BR) renamed the station Aylesbury High Street on 25 September 1950; it was then closed to passengers on 2 February 1953 and then freight on 2 December 1963. Routes The only intermediate station between Aylesbury and Cheddington was at Marston Gate. A 1911 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Aylesbury The site today The site is now occupied by an office block and a retail park. The route into Aylesbury has been taken over by a road named 'Stocklake' and 'Vale Park Drive' (part of the A418 road), although the formation remains mostly intact along the route of the road. During the summer of 2015 trees and vegetation were cleared from the formation in preparation for the construction of a new Stocklake (urban) road. On Monday 18 January 2016, contractors began work on the new road, which will use the trackbed of the old railway to link Park Street with Douglas Road, Aylesbury, parallel to the existing road. This will be converted into a new service road for homes and businesses, providing more parking and easier access.

In 1924, he was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly as the Labor member for Burra Burra. He was defeated in 1927, but held the seat again from 1930 to 1933. He transferred to the federal House of Representatives in 1938, winning a by-election for the seat of Wakefield caused by the death of the sitting United Australia Party member, Charles Hawker. McHugh faced long odds on paper. He needed a seemingly daunting 13 percent swing to win the seat, and his UAP opponent was former South Australian Premier Richard Layton Butler. However, on the third count, independent Percy Quirke's preferences flowed overwhelmingly to McHugh, allowing McHugh to take the seat on a shocking 20 percent swing. The seat's conservative nature reasserted itself in the 1940 election, when McHugh was defeated by UAP challenger Jack Duncan-Hughes, the former member for Boothby. McHugh returned to state politics, winning the seat of Light in 1941 and holding it until 1944. He died in 1952.

In pursuit of this mission, the Hollings Center convenes dialogue conferences that generate new thinking on important international issues and deepen channels of communication across opinion leaders and experts. History The conception of the Hollings Center emerged from two primary objectives. First was the need for an organization focused on opening and reinforcing networks and connections between the US and the predominantly Muslim world, particularly in the post-9/11 environment. Second was a strong desire to preserve the Palazzo Corpi, the historic former U.S. Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. The Hollings Center was established as a non-governmental organization by the U.S. Congress in 2004, primarily through the efforts of Senators Ernest F. Hollings (D-SC) and Judd Gregg (R-NH). Specifically, Congress called on the Center to \\"develop programs of cooperative study, training and research for students and scholars to exchange views and ideas\\" between the United States and the Muslim world. Congress also specifically designated that this Center would occupy the Palazzo Corpi. Located in Istanbul's historic Beyoƒülu neighborhood (formerly Pera), the Palazzo Corpi housed the official U.S. presence in Istanbul until 2003. It is one of the US' oldest diplomatic holdings and the Hollings Center was created in part to ensure that the historic Palazzo would remain part of the United States' international heritage. A steering committee, led by the Council of American Overseas Research Centers, developed a series of dialogue conferences to serve as the Hollings Center's signature program. Three categories of dialogue conferences emerged: Next Generation Dialogues, Regional Policy Dialogues and Higher Education Dialogues. In addition, a small grants program was created in conjunction with dialogue conferences, awarding conference participants modest sums to fund projects building on dialogue topics. More recently, the Center has begun a Speaker Series to expand upon dialogue outcomes to a broader public audience. The Center began operations in 2005, holding its first dialogue conference in May of that year. Since then, the Hollings Center has held roughly 30 Dialogue Conferences, hosting over 600 participants from about 40 countries. The Hollings Center has awarded over to previous participants to fund more than 25 small grants, establishing networks with hundreds of additional stakeholders. Officially named the International Center for Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue, the Center is more commonly known as the Hollings Center, in recognition of Senator Hollings whose efforts were crucial to its foundation. Senator Hollings retired in 2005 having achieved a notable 39-year career in the U.S. Senate. The Hollings Center is registered as a non-profit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization in the United States and as a foreign non-profit organization in Turkey. The Board of Directors is currently led by Ambassador Nicholas A. Veliotes, former Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs. =Palazzo Corpi= The Palazzo Corpi is one of the oldest U.S. government-owned diplomatic premises in the world. First built in 1830 by Genoese merchant Ignazio Corpi, American ambassador John G. A. Leishman rented the building for use as the U.S. legation and residence in 1882. Centrally located in the Beyoƒülu neighborhood (formerly Pera), the Palazzo Corpi's classical fa√ßade features an American eagle and crest. The interior is decorated with frescoes of mythological scenes, marble flooring and etched glasswork. In 1907, Ambassador Leishman used his personal funds to purchase the property for Ottoman liras, having decided that the US should own rather than lease the building. Leishman anticipated reimbursement from the U.S. government upon a return trip to Washington and was surprised to find that Congress had no plans for this repayment. Rather than accepting the personal expenditure, Leishman hosted several members of Congress to a party, inviting them to drink and play poker late into the night. Ambassador Leishman challenged the Congress members to a poker game over the status of the Palazzo and won, resulting in Congress repaying Leishman for the Palazzo and granting it two unique titles: the first diplomatic building purchased by the U.S. government and the only such building acquired through a card game. The Palazzo served as the U.S. embassy and residence from 1906 and then as the consulate general from 1937 until 2003, after the designation of Ankara as Turkey's capital in 1923 resulted in the transfer of embassy activities away from Istanbul. Throughout this history, the Palazzo Corpi served as a symbol of U.S. public diplomacy in the region. In 2003, the U.S. State Department moved the Consul General to a more modern facility on the European shore of the Bosphorous. Many of the diplomats and officials who had worked at the Palazzo Corpi were determined to preserve the building's history and significance to American foreign policy. Congress created the Hollings Center in 2004 to fill this role, designating the Center to host programs that will reinforce communication and understanding between the US and the Muslim world. To best preserve the history and structure of the Palazzo Corpi, the U.S. State Department negotiated on the Hollings Center's behalf for a Turkish holding company to spearhead renovations and restoration. This process was completed in early 2015, when the Palazzo Corpi reopened as a hotel and conference center. Featured in this new space is the Hollings Center's Istanbul presence, allowing for the continuation of the Palazzo Corpi's historic tradition of promoting dialogue and fostering cross-cultural cooperation.

He was the only drummer in his division to come away with his instrument, during a general rout. His superiors considered this a meritorious feat, when fellow soldiers had thrown away their guns. As a result, he received the Medal of Honor on the recommendation of his division commander, thereby becoming the youngest recipient of the highest decoration at 13 years of age.At the time, this was the only medal available besides the purple heart. Early life Johnston was born in Morristown, New York, in 1850 to William B. H. Johnston, and Eliza, both born in England.National Archives and Records Administration, 1850 Federal Census, File: M432, Roll 589, pg. 51 His mother died while he was young and the family moved to Montreal, Canada, by 1853 where his father, a railroad engineer and machinist, remarried to Theresa E. Martin. Apparently his family moved to Salem, Vermont (now Derby) by 1859.Theresa later stated she'd emigrated in 1859. Nat'l Archives and Records Administration, 1900 Federal Census, Film: T623, Roll 120, pg. 98 Civil War service Willie's father enlisted in the 3rd Vermont Infantry in June 1861 and the regiment mustered at St. Johnsbury on July 16. Young Willie intended to enlist at the same time and probably went with the regiment to Camp Griffin, outside Washington. He was present for duty with the regiment since it mustered but was originally denied pay, company officials thinking he was too young to draw pay. He was formally enlisted in Company D as a drummer on December 11, 1861, in camp. Descriptive rolls list him as 11 years old and five feet tall. His father was a member of Company B of the same regiment, with the rank of corporal, serving in the regimental color guard.Civil War Pension, Cpl. Wm. B. H. Johnston, application #407,829 =Signaling duties= While in camp Willie would have been at work all day sounding orders such as reveille, water and wood details, doctor's call, officer's call, dinner, and tattoo. During combat, standing beside his mounted regimental or company commander, he drummed commands such as march, double-quick, halt, cease-fire, or retreat. =The Peninsula Campaign= The 3rd Vermont was assigned to Brooks' Second Brigade (made up of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Vermont Infantry Regiments, often referred to as the Vermont Brigade), Smith's 2nd Division, Keyes' IV Corps, for McClellan's Peninsula Campaign. Johnston's first fight was at Lee's Mill, Virginia, on April 16, 1862. Companies D and F charged across the creek, temporarily taking the enemy works and suffering over thirty casualties. Willie's father, William was wounded in the battle, losing his right forefinger to the second joint, from a gun shot while charging the enemy. Two members of the regiment were later awarded Medals of Honor for actions during this battle. After Yorktown Brooks' Vermont Brigade, as part of Smith's Division, was ferried up the York River to Eltham's Landing where they built a pontoon wharf and offloaded supplies as they chased the withdrawing Confederates. On May 7 they supported Hancock's Brigade at the Battle of Williamsburg, only coming under stray fire. On May 18, Vermont Brigade was assigned to Franklin's VI Corps. During his next campaign, the Seven Days Battles from June 25 to July 1, 1862, Johnston earned his medal. On June 26 the Vermont Brigade worked all day and through the night to erect a redoubt at the crest of a wheat field near Garnett's Farm. The next day brought much artillery shelling as they came under fire from Magruder's Division. Smith responded with his artillery and directed another battery to fire on the east side of the Chickahominy in support of Porter's V Corps. This action at Garnett's Farm convinced McClellan that he was fighting Confederate troops on both sides of the Chickahominy, prompting him to order a general withdrawal toward the James River. On June 28 they were at Golding's Farm when the division was ordered to the left to connect with Sumner's II Corps line where they were again severely shelled. On the 29th Smith's Division moved to a point in front of Savage's Station to help cover the Union withdrawal. Realizing he was ahead of the main battle lines, and as the enemy formed in front, Smith ordered the division to fall back to the station. As the battle heated up the Vermont Brigade was thrown to the left. As the 3rd was forming up in the woods an approaching soldier called out \\"Who are you?\\" A soldier of the 3rd called out \\"Friends!\\" Another query, \\"Which regiment?\\" \\"Third Vermont!\\", came the reply. It turned out to be the 5th Louisiana and the rest of Semmes' Brigade, McLaws' Division. A heated fire ensued. The Vermonters eventually charged the enemy, driving them off, but suffering heavily, taking 439 casualties including General Brooks, who was wounded in the thigh.War Dept, United States. The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies. ; Series 1 - Volume 11 (Part II), Washington: Govt. Printing Office, 1884. Chapter 23, Brig. Gen. Paul Semmes' Report: pg. 723. Assuming each regiment fielded about 500 men, one in six were wounded or killed. And Willie was right in the middle of it. That night, unable to move the wounded, Smith left his surgical staff to tend them and marched to positions south of White Oak Swamp bridge, holding the right flank during the Battle of Malvern Hill. Again they were under heavy artillery fire, this time from Stonewall Jackson's force on the north side of the swamp. On July 1 Smith's Division was posted to positions on Turkey Creek, arriving at Harrison's Landing early in the morning of the second. Smith noted in his summary report that every march was made at night. During that retreat many men threw away all their equipment so they would have less weight to carry. Johnston, however, retained his drum and brought it safely to Harrison's Landing. There, he had the honor of drumming for the division parade on July 4, he being the only drummer to bring his instrument off the battlefields. Neither General Smith, the division commander, nor General Brooks, the brigade commander, made any note of Willie's feat in their after-action reports.War Dept, United States. The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies. ; Series 1 - Volume 11 (Part II), Washington: Govt. Printing Office, 1884. Chapter 23, Smith's Report: pp 463-465, and Brooks': pp 476-477. President Lincoln arrived by gunboat and was present for the parade of the entire Army of the Potomac conducted on July 8. It is suggested that Lincoln heard the story and wrote Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, suggesting the youth be given a medal, but no evidence exists. In any case Stanton approved the award and Willie Johnston was presented his Medal of Honor on September 16, 1863, at the age of 13, for a deed performed when he was but 11 years and 11 months of age. No official details of the reason for Willie's award survive, but the story is found in contemporary newspapers.St. Johnsbury, The Caledonian, 31 Oct 1863 This was the second Medal of Honor ever awarded. Secretary Stanton presented the actual award and Willie's file contains a signed receipt for the decoration. =Post-award service= After the campaign, Johnston served as a nurse in a hospital in Baltimore and was transferred to Company H, 20th Regiment of Veteran Reserve Corps, where he played in the regimental brass band as Drum Major. His carte de visite photograph must have been taken at this time as his cap insignia is from this unit. Johnston re-enlisted, on the same day as his father, at Brandy Station, Va., on February 15, 1864. After some confusion as to which unit he'd reenlisted in (He'd intended to return to the 3rd Vermont, yet he was still on the rolls of the 20th VRC) he was mustered out of service on December 30, 1865. Post-war years Tracing Willie's life after the army has frustrated many researchers, but new information has come to light. He evidently had an interest in making the military a career. In 1867 Johnston competed for a position at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, but wasn't selected.St. Johnsbury, The Caledonian, 22 Feb 1867, pg. 3 He then attended Norwich University in 1869 but is listed as a non-graduate.Ellis, William Arba, Norwich University, 1819-1911: Her History, Her Graduates, Her Roll of Honor, pg. 655. He moved to Charlestown, Massachusetts, and on March 1, 1870, was married to Nellie Murphy.Massachusetts, Marriages, 1841-1915, Volume 227, Charlestown, Massachusetts, State Archives, Boston; LDS microfilm 1433028, p. 149, No. 54 They had five children, the eldest son being named William Henry Johnston, so it is supposed this was also his father's full name.Massachusetts, Births, 1841-1915, LDS microfilm 1428075, pg. 171 The family lived at 65 Tremont Street, Charlestown, where he worked as a machinist, the same occupation as his father. Since this address is just outside the gates of the Boston Navy Yard, and Willie's father had stated that he was with the navy, this was probably his employer. An article in the Boston Journal, repeated in the May 17, 1888, issue of The St. Johnsbury Republican, described someone finding Willie's Civil War drum, complete with silver plate inscribed with his name and description of his medal of honor action, \\"in an old house in Chelsea\\", leading people and newspapers to speculate on his whereabouts. It was at this time that his father traveled to St. Johnsbury and told locals that he was 'with the Navy.' By 1878 Willie had moved to 136 Chelsea Street in Charlestown, so there may have been a mixup by the reporter. He was still alive in 1899 when he attended a Medal of Honor Legion reunion in Burlington, Vermont. In that article, his home town was not noted.The Vermonter, Publisher: Charles Spooner Forbes, St. Albans, Vermont, Vol V, No. 1, 1899, pps 15-17 It has been reported that he died on September 16, 1941, at an unknown location, but the source has never been properly cited.

Historical note Until the establishment of the Medal of Honor there was only one decoration presented in the United States Army - the original Purple Heart. However, since the Purple Heart had not been awarded since the Revolutionary War, and would not be used again until World War I, the Medal of Honor was effectively the only award available to U.S. military personnel at the time of the Civil War. After the war the government ordered a review of medal awards and rescinded many, but Willie's was allowed to stand.

He was a member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1919 to 1934, representing the electorate of Angas. He represented the Australian Labor Party until resigning during the 1931 Labor split; however, he did not join the United Australia Party along with the other dissident MPs, and instead remained in parliament as an independent. Early life, missionary and business work Gabb was born in Glenelg, and was educated at St Peter's College. He worked for printers A. & E. Lewis and then for grocers Barns, Stobie, & Co. after leaving school. He had studied at night to become a Methodist missionary while working at the grocers, and after qualifying for home mission work, worked from 1905 reopening a mission on Kangaroo Island, then at churches in Cockburn, Silverton, Kalangadoo and Penola, and on the Tea Tree Gully-Modbury circuit. He passed as a candidate for ministry and studied at Prince Alfred College in 1908, before spending two and a half years preaching from a motor launch on the Murray River between Swan Reach and Loxton. He then left missionary work because of doctrinal differences, did not enter the ministry, and instead opened a store at Alberton until his election to parliament. He married Florence Ethel Hobbs on 9 October 1912. He was publicly involved in the campaign against conscription during World War I, and unsuccessfully contested the 1918 state election in the electorate of Barossa, narrowly losing to Sir Richard Butler. Gabb was a strict teetotaller. Federal politics In 1919, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Labor member for Angas, defeating long-serving Nationalist MP and Minister for Home and Territories Paddy Glynn. He drew public attention in 1920 when he refused to accept a salary increase from ¬£600 to ¬£1,000. He was known for often calling quorum when the amount of MPs in the parliamentary chamber was low, believing that its strict application forced MPs to do their elected duties. He was re-elected at the 1922 election, defeating George Ritchie, who had resigned as state Treasurer to challenge Gabb. Gabb was defeated by Nationalist candidate Walter Parsons in 1925, but defeated Parsons in 1929 to regain the seat. In 1931, he joined Joseph Lyons and several other members in leaving the Labor Party in the 1931 Labor split and supported a no-confidence motion in Labor Prime Minister James Scullin; Gabb stated that he believed Scullin was a \\"sincere man\\", but strongly disapproved of Treasurer Ted Theodore. Unlike his colleagues, did not join the new United Australia Party and instead remained in parliament as an independent. In the same year, the Sydney Morning Herald described Gabb as being an \\"unexciting speaker\\" and \\"a sort of inverted alchemist afflicted with an ambition for turning gold into lead.\\" He responded to criticism for wasting parliamentary time with quorum calls in May by stating \\"if the economy were really considered this show [parliament] would be shut down\\" and \\"close it and let me act as Mussolini and I will run things in a better way!\\" He was re- elected as an independent with the support of the Emergency Committee of South Australia at the 1931 federal election. In 1932, he moved a bill to reduce parliamentary salaries to ¬£600, which while opposed by the vast majority of MPs, caused Minister for Commerce Charles Hawker to resign from the ministry in order to vote for the bill. Gabb's seat of Angas was abolished in a redistribution prior to the 1934 election, at which he retired. Later life and death After losing his seat in 1925, he was secretary of the South Australian branch of the Federated Gas Employees' Industrial Union until he regained the seat in 1929. He contested the 1938 state election as an independent, nominating against Premier Richard Layton Butler in his seat of Light, but was unsuccessful. Gabb rarely listened to radio coverage of politics in later years because he felt broadcasting was bringing Parliament into disrepute. He remained publicly critical of parliamentary salary increases in later life, accusing politicians of \\"feathering their nests\\". He committed suicide at his Rosewater home in 1951, and was cremated.

Established in 1960, it had 106 rooms on eight stories. The hotel has fallen into disrepair after being occupied by squatters who were removed before a failed effort at a Libyan-funded renovation. The building sits on Ducor Hill, the highest point of the city, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, the Saint Paul River and Monrovia's West Point district. It is located at the end of Broad Street across from United Nations Boulevard in Monrovia's main business district.  History  The hotel was designed and built by Israeli industrialist Moshe Mayer. It opened in 1960 as the Ducor Palace Hotel, it was the first international-class hotel in Liberia, and was for many years one of the few five-star hotels in all of Africa. The inauguration ceremony was an international affair, attended by President Sekou Toure of Guinea, and Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir, among others. Intercontinental Hotels assumed operation in 1962 and it was renamed the Ducor Intercontinental.https://www.nealprincetrust.org/id632.html The Ducor Intercontinental hosted important meetings between African leaders. Idi Amin is said to have swum in its pool while carrying his gun. President Houphouet- Boigny of the Ivory Coast was so impressed with the hotel during his stay that he commissioned Mayer to erect a similar luxury hotel in Abidjan, the Hotel Ivoire. The Ducor's various amenities, such as its pool, tennis courts, and a French restaurant, made it popular with tourists from the C√¥te d'Ivoire and Ghana, as well as visiting professionals from the US, Europe, and Asia. Inter- Continental Hotels ceased managing the hotel in 1985.https://www.nealprincetrust.org/id632.html With political uncertainty looming, the Ducor Hotel closed in 1989, just before the coup led by Charles Taylor which ousted President Samuel Doe and marked the beginning of the First Liberian Civil War. The building endured much damage during this period, due both to the violence of the war and to postwar looting. During this time, displaced residents of many of Monrovia's slums began to occupy the hotel's empty rooms. In 2007, the Ministry of Justice evicted the squatters residing in the hotel. In 2008, the Government of Liberia signed a lease agreement with the Government of Libya, who began clearing the property of debris in 2010 in preparation for a bidding process to be completed by June 2010.http://www.libyaonline.com/business/details.php?id=14250 The Italian design firm Serapioni prepared models of the renovated hotel. The project was delayed several times, before finally being abandoned upon Liberia's severing of diplomatic relations with the Gaddafi government following the outbreak of the 2011 Libyan civil war.

With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian Federation emerged as its successor state in 1991. Currently Russia's ambassador to Vanuatu is (who is also Russia's ambassador to Australia, and Russia's other non-resident embassies in Canberra such as Fiji, Nauru, and Tonga).

Lini's foreign policy was one of non- alignment, manifested by Vanuatu joining the Non-Aligned Movement in 1983. His government was the only one in Oceania at the time which refused to align with the Western bloc during the dying stages of the Cold War. Lini sought to maintain cordial, though not particularly close, relations with the Soviet Union. There was never any suggestion of Vanuatu aligning with the Eastern bloc; Lini was not a Marxist, and there was no Communist Party in Vanuatu. In 1987, Vanuatu authorised Soviet vessels to fish within Vanuatu's Exclusive Economic Zone, in exchange for economic aid. The agreement lapsed the following year, and was not renewed, due to disagreements over the price to be paid for fishing rights by the USSR. The year 1991 was marked both by the end of Lini's last term in office and by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Thereafter, relations between Port-Vila and Moscow were virtually non- existent. In 2011, however, Vanuatu (under Prime Minister Sato Kilman) did follow Russia's lead in recognising the breakaway Georgian province of Abkhazia as a sovereign state. Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Carlot \\"offered little explanation for the decision [but] did give hints.

Ringland began his lifelong government career in 1900 when he joined the U.S. Forest Service where he helped establish the national park and national forest system. Between 1900 and 1945, Arthur Ringland led a variety of government programs that ranged from conservation work to refugee relief. In 1945 he originated the concept of the private voluntary organization that became CARE. A principal aspect of that work was persuading the government to provide ships to transport food packages that had been donated for the needy in Europe. He thus became known as \\"the father of CARE,\\" and was honored for his efforts by the United Nations in 1958. He was born in New York, received his master's degree in forestry at the Sheffield School of Science, Yale University. He entered Federal forest work while still a student in 1900. His obituary notes he was 99 when he died. In 1905, the year the modern Forest Service was created as an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Mr. Ringland was assigned to the Southwest Region. As one of the first graduate foresters ever to work in the area, he was appointed Forest Assistant on the Lincoln National Forest. From 1908 to 1916 he was District Forester (Regional Forester) for the Southwestern Region. He led the survey crew that established the boundaries of the National Forests in the Region and a pioneer of fire planning. Mr. Ringland was present in the office of President Taft when the New Mexico statehood proclamation was signed in 1912. In 1917, he joined the Army. He was assigned to a forestry regiment formed to run sawmills in France. After the war he stayed on to serve on the Board of War Damages for the American Peace Commission. Between 1919 and 1921 Mr. Ringland was chief of mission, under Herbert Hoover, for the American Relief Administration in Europe He directed the post war relief to Czechoslovakian children and from 1922 to 1924 was chief of mission to Turkey for relief of Russian refugees.

He was a Labor member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1983 to 1984, a prominent barrister in Darwin afterwards, the author of the controversial 1999 Reeves Report on Aboriginal land rights in Australia, and has been a Judge of the Federal Court of Australia since November 2007. From 2007 to 2012 (until the appointment of Duncan Kerr), he was the only former politician serving on the Federal Court, and the only former politician serving on an Australian appellate court. Political career Reeves was born in Stanthorpe, Queensland, and was admitted as a solicitor in 1975 after completing five years articles of clerkship and the Queensland Solicitors Admission Course. He moved to Alice Springs, where he worked as a solicitor, and became involved with the Labor Party.The Hon. John Edward Reeves, Federal Court of Australia. Accessed 21 April 2009.Ramsey, Alan. Give me land, lots of ‚Äì oops, wrong lyrics, Sydney Morning Herald, 7 July 2007. He won preselection to contest the Northern Territory seat in the House of Representatives for the 1983 federal election. He was elected amidst the election of the Hawke government, ending a 17-year hold on the seat by the Coalition (the Country Party until 1974, and the Country Liberal Party afterward). Another federal election was held the following year, however, and Reeves faced a strong challenge when the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Paul Everingham, resigned to challenge Reeves. Initially thought to have little chance against the popular Everingham, he closed the gap in the polls significantly during the campaign. Ultimately, he was defeated on the fourth count, losing by 1,800 votes. Reeves had moved to Darwin upon his election to parliament, and returned to his legal practice there after his 1984 defeat, being admitted to the bar the following year.Pelly, Michael. \\"Reeves selection cheered\\", The Australian, 28 September 2007.\\"Member Profiles: John Reeves\\" , Northern Territory Bar Association. Accessed 21 April 2009. He remained involved in the Labor Party, where he was heavily associated with the party's right-wing faction, and initially was a staunch ally of Opposition Leader Bob Collins. Reeves subsequently nominated and won the presidency of the Northern Territory branch of the ALP in 1985 over concerted opposition from the party's left wing. Though he remained ideologically aligned with Collins during his term as party president, Reeves announced in 1986 that he intended to run for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly at the 1987 territory election, in a move that was widely seen as a prelude to a leadership challenge against Collins. He lost preselection for the highly marginal CLP seat of Jingili, and was forced to contest the less marginal seat of Casuarina, which he went on to lose to incumbent MLA Nick Dondas. Reeves' influence within the ALP began to wane significantly after 1987. A left-wing candidate, Warren Snowdon, won preselection for the federal seat for the 1987 federal election. Reeves strongly criticised Snowdon, stating that his victory was an \\"aberration\\" and urging the party not to shift to the left. Snowdon's supporters moved to gain control of the NT branch at the 1987 party conference, ousting both Reeves as party president and his ally Collins as delegate to the party's National Executive. Reeves attempted to make a political comeback at the 1990 territory election, but lost preselection for Casuarina and did not run for public office again. Legal career and the Reeves Report Reeves developed a significant legal practice as a barrister in Darwin in the 1990s, and became increasingly distant from the Labor Party. In 1996, after his former rival Nick Dondas defeated Snowdon for the Northern Territory seat, he represented Dondas against a Court of Disputed Returns challenge by Snowdon. He was a close friend of Shane Stone, the CLP Chief Minister from 1995, and was appointed as a Queens Counsel by Stone in 1997. In 1997, Liberal Prime Minister John Howard announced an inquiry into the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976. Reeves, known to be the CLP's preferred appointee, was tipped the head the inquiry, and was duly appointed in October 1997. The appointment was criticised by Aboriginal groups both for his lack of judicial experience and his history of defending developers accused of desecrating Aboriginal sacred sites. The Reeves Report (full title The Aboriginal Land Rights Act (Northern Territory) 1976, Building on Land Rights for the Next Generation ), was released in August 1998, and advocated sweeping changes to land rights legislation, including the scrapping of permits for access to Aboriginal land, granting the Northern Territory Government compulsory acquisition powers over Aboriginal land, and scrapping the Aboriginal land councils in favour of a new body. It notably did not, however, recommend the abolition of the right for Aboriginal communities to veto proposed mining projects on their land, a change that the mining industry had been heavily lobbying for. The report was strongly opposed in Aboriginal communities across the territory at public hearings, with a copy of the report being publicly burned at Yuendumu and prominent Aboriginal leaders, including Galarrwuy Yunupingu and Alison Anderson, attacking the report in the media. It also received a lukewarm response in federal parliament, despite strong support from the Stone territory government; it was vigorously opposed by a number of prominent former Liberal politicians, including Malcolm Fraser, Ian Viner, Ian Wilson, Peter Baume, and Fred Chaney. A cross-party parliamentary committee in the House of Representatives unanimously declined to adopt the report's recommendations; it was also rejected by the corresponding committee in the Senate. None of its recommendations were enacted into law in the aftermath, but some were revived a decade later by the Howard government as part of the Northern Territory National Emergency Response. Appointment as a Judge of the Federal Court Reeves remained a prominent figure in the Northern Territory legal community, serving as President of the Northern Territory Bar Association from 2000 to 2005 and Vice-President of the Australian Bar Association from 2003 to 2004. He also served as Deputy Chair of the Legal Practitioner's Complaints Committee, and as Chairman of the Northern Territory division of the Australian Red Cross. He was also appointed to the taskforce of the Northern Territory National Emergency Response in 2007. Reeves was appointed to the Federal Court of Australia in November 2007, as one of the last judicial appointments of the Howard government. He was the first judge to be specifically based in Darwin, which had previously been served by interstate judges in an acting capacity. In March 2009, however, he was transferred to Brisbane, following concerns that the judicial workload in Darwin was not sufficient to warrant a resident judge, and a number of cases from which he had to withdraw due to potential conflicts of interest with his past legal work as a barrister. Reeves is one of only six politicians to have served in both the Parliament of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia, alongside Nigel Bowen, Robert Ellicott, Merv Everett, Tony Whitlam and Duncan Kerr. His notable decisions include (in no particular order); Stoddart v Boulton [2009] FCA 1108 regarding spousal privilege at common law in Australia and QGC Pty Limited v Bygrave [2011] FCA 1457 dealing with the role and registration of Indigenous Land Use Agreements. Reeves was also the docket Judge for the Australian Securities and Investment Commission's litigation in 2011‚Äì12 against the collapsed Storm Financial Ltd. The litigation also involved the Commonwealth Bank, Macquarie Bank and the Bank of Queensland. On 1 May 2009 Justice Reeves was appointed as an Additional Judge of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. Justice Reeves travels to both Darwin and Alice Springs in this capacity.

Due to his major role in the liberation of the Poonch valley regions of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, the village of Sarsawa was subsequently renamed Sakhi Delair Abad in his honour. Military career Raja Sakhi Delair Khan joined the Indian National Army within which he was promoted to the rank of General. He resigned from his post and joined the All-India Muslim League on June 6, 1946. League leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah requested that he file a report about the current situation of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Khan visited the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Ram Chandra Kak and the last ruling Maharrajah, Maharaja Hari Singh, to better understand their views on whether Jammu and Kashmir should join with Pakistan as laid out in the British proposal for post-Independence India and Pakistan. He reported back to Jinnah at his residence at Aurang Zaib Road, Delhi in 1946 that an alternative plan was required to liberate Jammu and Kashmir. Khan tried to organise army veterans and recruit them for the fighting for Jammu and Kashmir by showing them a circular signed by Jinnah establishing a War Council on September 5, 1947. Following this, Khan led many battles against the Dogra forces that were currently in control of the area, particularly in Kotli District and Rajouri District. Under the leadership of Raja Sakhi Daler Khan the Muslims of Rajouri rose against the Dogra rulers and took Rajouri. Rajouri was subsequently subject to a heavy armed assault lasting several days by the Fiftieth Parachute Brigade, the Eightieth Brigade, and the 19th Indian Infantry Brigade supported by tanks of the Central Indian Horse.

A new Ottoman sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Ohrid, Ballaban Badera (of Albanian origin), was sent by Sultan Mehmed II to inflict heavy losses on the Albanian forces. Skanderbeg had been prepared for the battle and prepared his troops for a plan of action. This worked well until some of Skanderbeg's officers did not follow orders to stop chasing the Ottoman forces and were captured along with their men. The officers were sent back to Constantinople where they were tortured and executed and their bodies were thrown to the dogs.Noli p. 138. Background and prelude The Sultan Mehmed II gave Ballaban Badera, who was a sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Ohrid, the reins of the Ottoman campaigns in Albania. Ballaban had been a peasant in Skanderbeg's paternal domains who was raised through the devsirme to become a Janissary for the Sultan, much like Skanderbeg.Franco p. 337. Ballaban was wary of his own defeat so he presented Skanderbeg with a series of gifts so that if the Ottoman commander was captured, the Albanian chieftain would have enough mercy to spare him. Ballaban had known Skanderbeg when they were both in the Ottoman court, but the former had always held great animosity towards the latter. Ballaban always tried to come off as Skanderbeg's personal friend and ally, but he was always ready for the moment to assault him. Once he learned that Skanderbeg had been camped in Vaikal with 4,500 men, Ballaban began his campaign to defeat Skanderbeg. Battle-plan Skanderbeg had been waiting for an Ottoman assault and exhorted to his troops to constantly be prepared. The day before the battle, he explained the warriors' plan of action. He planned to trick the Ottomans into thinking that his forces were too weak and too frightened to fight. When the Ottomans were finally lured into both the valley and a false sense of security, the Albanian warriors would pounce on them. The Ottoman forces would then be chased all the way up to the hills and the Albanians would stop there to avoid a counterattack. Battle The next day Ballaban came past the hills but, unexpectedly, charged at Skanderbeg's forces with great speed and fury. Skanderbeg allowed them to get near him and then he launched his own counterattack. A bloody battle soon followed with heavy casualties on both sides, but the Albanians managed to hold their ground and soon, the frightened Ottoman soldiers began to flee. As commanded, the Albanians pursued them up to the hills before many of the forces halted. The Albanians held the ground in the end, but it had come at a very great cost. Some of Skanderbeg's most trusted men were captured in this battle, including: Moisi Gjurica; Muzaka of Angelina; Gjin Muzaka; Gjon Perlati; Nikoll√´ Berisha; Gjergj Kuka; Gjin Maneshi. These men were overcome by the heat of the battle and did not follow Skanderbeg's orders to stay below the hills and were captured by the reformed Ottoman forces. The Turks hid and ambushed the Albanian officers and their companions. The Turkish cavalry regained its confidence and they climbed on top of a high point where the infantry was stationed. Ballaban, however, was content with his soldiers' achievements and marched back to Constantinople with the captured captains.Franco p. 338. Aftermath Skanderbeg sent an ambassador to the Sultan to beg him to return his officers unharmed or else he would execute his own prisoners of war. The Sultan was not moved. He ordered a fifteen-day torture of the Albanian officers. Mehmed ordered Ballaban to continue his campaigns against Albania. Ballaban invaded Albania again, only to be soundly defeated.

Damage is a direct-to-video film; it did receive a theatrical cinema release in the United States on January 28, 2010. Plot Released on parole after serving four of seven years in prison for second degree manslaughter, John Brickner (Steve Austin) moves to Seattle, where he gets a job as a construction worker during the day and a bouncer at a bar at night. One day, after work, he meets up with Veronica Reynolds (Lynda Boyd), the widow of the man he killed in self- defense. It is revealed that she petitioned to have John released on parole following numerous apology letters he had written to her over the years. She also tells him that her eight-year-old daughter Sarah (Katelyn Mager) is in need of a heart transplant, and he should be the one to cover the US$250,000 operation. With the help of bar waitress Frankie (Laura Vandervoort), John locates fight promoter Reno Paulsaint (Walton Goggins), whom he had initially rejected a job offer. When he realizes that the job is in the world of underground fighting, he once again declines the offer, despite Reno telling him he can score six figure earnings in the business.

John continues to fight for Reno and Frankie and rise up in the ranks and earning thousands. It turns out, however, that Reno owes a syndicate over US$150,000 and must pay them within a week, or they will hurt Frankie whom he had covered for the debt.

During a fight, he defeats his opponent, but forfeits the match when he realizes that it is to the death. This results in Reno losing his wager and being roughed up by the syndicate. The next day, John is picked up by a tycoon named Veltz (William B. Davis), who turns out to be the owner of his former job. As a token of gratitude for saving his son-in-law's life from a heart attack, Veltz offers to cover John's US$150,000 wager for the main event or to clear Reno's debt. John chooses to clear Reno's debt. The next night, John faces and defeats the defending champion Wendell Timmons (Tony Bailey).

The house also includes the Glenview Mansion Art Gallery. History Catherine and Richard Johns Bowie, the original owners of the property, purchased 500 acres of land that the mansion now stands on and cleared its forests to grow corn, wheat, rye, potatoes, and hay as well as raise cattle, horses, sheep, and pigs. In 1838, they built a two-story house on the highest point of their property and named it Glenview. Glenview remained in the Bowie family until 1904, then changed hands several times before 1917, when it was purchased by Irene and William Smith. In 1923 architects Lochie and Porter were hired to transform Glenview from a farm to a fashionable country estate designed for entertaining. The original house the Bowies built still survives in the center of the much larger Neoclassical mansion. After Irene Lyon's death in 1950, her husband James Alexander Lyon began selling off parcels of the estate for housing developments, eventually selling the mansion to the Montgomery County Historical Society in 1954. In 1957, the City of Rockville purchased Glenview and 28 acres for $125,000 to become a civic center. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

He was then elected to the Australian House of Representatives at the 1917 federal election, but died only five days later. Howroyd was born in Dewsbury in Yorkshire, England and was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School in Wakefield and Turton College in York. He initially migrated to Victoria before going into business as a stock and share broker in Hobart, Tasmania. He lived in the United States for some years before returning to Melbourne and then Launceston, where he lived from 1898 and worked as a commission agent. He was secretary of the Launceston Stock Exchange, founder of the St George's Society in Launceston, a member of the Launceston Hospital board and a justice of the peace. A trade unionist, he was also general secretary of the Railway Employees' Association in Tasmania for five years. He was the secretary of the Federal Protection League from 1900, but was one of the founding members of the Tasmanian branch of the Labor Party when it was established in 1903. He was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly in 1906 for North Launceston, transferring to the new multi-member seat of Bass in 1909 and topping the poll there in his re-election in 1912.

He advocated a \\"reformation scheme\\" including reforming the system for the selection of Crown lands, prioritising agricultural and mining industries and developing the west coast, altering the role of local government in rates assessment and taxation collection, and changes to the overall taxation system. He also supported a poll tax, opposed further extension of the Legislative Council franchise, opposed the nationalisation of industries and the introduction of industrial relations legislation, and supported increasing the salary of members of parliament while reducing their number in both houses. Whitsitt suggested that he could prevent industrial strife by \\"studying mankind\\", and upon being asked at a public meeting how he would protect workers from unscrupulous employers, he answered \\"are there any?\\" He retired from the campaign in February on the basis that he had \\"urgent business interests\\" requiring travel to England, but re-entered the race in March, postponing his trip until April. He missed the postal cutoff for the close of nominations but saved his candidacy by engaging a motor from the Emu Bay Railway to send the form to Zeehan. He won the sixth and final seat in Darwin at the expense of Treasurer Don Urquhart, who he had criticised heavily in the campaign. Following his election, there was considerable debate in the media and in parliament about the possibility that he could be unseated due to being overseas and thus being unable to be personally sworn in during the first sitting of parliament. This was resolved in July by granting Whitsitt a leave of absence, allowing him to be belatedly sworn in on 21 September. He then took his seat on the government benches (of Elliott Lewis). He voted to support the Lewis government in a no-confidence vote in September, but crossed the floor to bring the Lewis government down in October, reaffirming his independence and noting that as the 1909 anti-Labor Fusion that had formed the Commonwealth Liberal Party had happened whilst he was in England, it did not apply to him. He then crossed the floor again within the same week to bring the new Labor Earle government down. He cited as his reasons for the abrupt turnaround being disagreement with the Lewis government over government policy on the potato industry, the resolution of a \\"mutiny\\" within the Liberals by Norman Ewing and his supporters, and Whitsitt's opposition to a Labor attempt to introduce full adult suffrage. He successfully defended his seat in 1916 and 1919. Federal politics In 1922, he transferred to federal politics, winning the federal seat of Darwin in the Australian House of Representatives for the Country Party, defeating sitting Nationalist member George Bell. He retired in 1925, returning to farming. Whitsitt died in 1943.

Education He attended Launceston Church Grammar School. Football Challis was a Tasmanian and started his career at Launceston, where he was a premiership player in 1909 and regular NTFA representative at the State Championships. He also represented Tasmania at the 1911 Adelaide Carnival, participating in their famous win over Western Australia. During this time he played mainly as a half forward or rover but when he was lured to Carlton in 1912 he soon established himself as a wingman. It was in that position that he starred in Carlton's 1915 premiership team. He almost missed out on the chance to win a premiership as he had attempted to join the army at the beginning of the season, only to be refused because his toes overlapped.

This programme is sponsored by Professional & Educational Services Ltd (PESI) and is carried out under the leadership of both Student Department of School Committee of Communist Party and School Committee of Youth League. With the idea of ‚Äú Receive help, Self- Help and then Help Others‚Äù, Siyuan is aimed at training excellent students to understand the essence of dedication, innovation and leadership. Every spring, Siyuan will recruit its new members from freshmen; those elected are out- standing students with different major backgrounds. Once admitted, these students will have the chance to be trained at social work, to perceive the situation of the country and to cultivate a global horizon. Siyuan started in Tsinghua and has spread to other 5 universities by now. It selects 30 students a year from each university.  Name  The name of the programme, Siyuan, which means ‚Äúto remember the wellhead‚Äùin Chinese, comes from the Chinese idiom ‚ÄúNever forget where one's happiness comes from‚Äù. This name is closely related to the concept and idea of this programme. (For more, please refer to the ‚ÄúIdea‚Äù part.)  Sponsor  The initiator of Siyuan Programme is Doctor QIAN Bingyi, who is now the director of Professional Education Systems Institute (PESI), which is a Non-Profit organization of people united by Chinese-North in California, founded in 1988. The organization works for promoting the education and profession exchange between North America and Asia. Dr. Qian graduated from University of California, Berkeley and gets his PHD at University of California, San Francisco. Another initiator is Mr. ZHU Weiren(Sandy Chau), who is both a successful entrepreneur in the IT industry and a kind Philanthropist. He is now a board member of Achievo Corporation in California, the USA and the president of Shin Shin Educational Foundation, US. He also graduated from UC Berkeley. Tsinghua Entrepreneurs & Executive Club (TEEC) is an independent non-government organization founded by Tsinghua alumni, dedicated toward promoting innovation and start-ups in high-tech industries. When Mr. Zhu Weiren decided to set up the Siyuan Programme in Tsinghua, he wanted to match each student in this programme with a mentor. Some Tsinghua alumni who have carved out in IT industry came up with the idea to start up Tsinghua Entrepreneur Group (TEG), the predecessor of TEEC. There is a Siyuan Committee in TEEC to deal with the contact between entrepreneurs and students. TEEC has been supporting Siyuan Programme since it was set up in 2001.  Idea  The idea of Siyuan can be interpreted as ‚ÄúReceive help, Self- Help and Help Others‚Äù. Actually, this idea was first put forward by the founders of TEEC. Narrowly speaking, ‚ÄúReceive help‚Äù means that Tsinghua students benefit from Tsinghua‚Äôs education ; ‚ÄúSelf-Help‚Äù means that Tsinghua alumni help each other when they go to work and fight for their cause; ‚ÄúHelp Others‚Äù means that successful alumni give their hands to students with their experience. But in a general sense, Siyuaners prefer the following explanation. ‚ÄúBe Helped‚Äù means ‚Äúbe helped by anyone when they need help especially when they are at school‚Äù, ‚ÄúSelf-Help‚Äù means ‚Äúhelp each other who are related to Siyuan Programme especially students themselves‚Äù, ‚ÄúHelp Others‚Äù means ‚Äúhelp those who need help most according to one‚Äôs capability‚Äù. The ‚Äúcycle‚Äù lays stress on social responsibility and the spirit of service.  Training Programme  Every student selected by the programme will be trained according to the training plan. The current version of the plan contains two main aspects: summer practice and training during the semesters. The summer practice will last throughout the whole four years of these undergraduates. They take part in three practice programme during three summer holidays respectively. The themes of the three practice programme are ‚ÄúRural and China‚Äù, ‚ÄúEconomics and China‚Äù and ‚ÄúGlobe and China‚Äù. During ‚ÄúRural and China‚Äù, which is in the first summer, students go to underdeveloped areas in China. They support the education there as tutors and investigate the poverty and problems of development. ‚ÄúEconomics and China‚Äù requires students to go to the developed areas in China, such as the Yangtze River Delta, to realize the fast development after the Reforming and Opening-up Policy was carried out in 1978. In the third year, with the programme ‚ÄúGlobe and China‚Äù, students go to Hong Kong to broad their horizons and understand the globalization of China today. During the three years at school, there are also three themes: ‚ÄúTeam Work‚Äù, ‚ÄúVolunteerism and Organizing Skills‚Äù and ‚ÄúLeadership Training‚Äù. Students will take part in orientation, a course called ‚ÄúIntroduction to the Social Service of College Students‚Äù, youth forums, etc.  Organization  Every spring, Siyuan will select excellent freshmen from all departments. After the writing test and interview, the list of new Siyuaners will be open to the public. Students graduated in different years are named after ordinal numbers. The first Siyuaners are the 2001 ones, who are called Siyuan 1st, so the most recent ones are called Siyuan 7th. There will be one or two support tutors assigned to the new Siyuaners every year. Siyuan is organized under the leadership of Organization Department of School Committee of Youth League. In the year 2008, Siyuan formed a complete organization called Siyuan Group. There are 5 subgroups in charge of Contact & Investigation, Propaganda & Planning, Inner Quality Expanding, Networks & Websites, Internal Liaison and Recruiting separately. The Siyuaners manage themselves in this organization and facilitate the development of the programme. The mission of Contact & Investigation Group is to do some researches on the influence the programme itself has on Siyuaners, i.e. whether they have understood the idea of ‚ÄúBe Helped, Self-Help and Help Others‚Äù. Besides, they have to update the contact information so that Siyuaners can keep in touch with each other even when they graduate from school. Planning & Promotion Group takes charge of the propaganda work. They edit stuff to bring this programme known to outsiders. The materials will also be useful when the website is being set up. Sponsors, teachers and assistants are all glad to keep up with what Siyuaners are doing now. So Propaganda & Planning Group plays really an important role. Inner Quality Expanding Group searches for information of lectures, exhibitions and performances. Then they organize Siyuaners in different grades to attend these activities, which not only edifies their minds but also facilitates communications. Networks & Websites Group is in charge of Siyuan‚Äôs own website. The website hasn‚Äôt been set up until Nov, 2008. Internal Liaison Group organizes literature and sport activities regularly to build up relations between Siyuaners, which include some favorite and popular ones, such as football games and Kara OK. Recruiting Group recruits new members for the programme. Every spring, they filter resumes, design examinations, help to interview students and finally help to decide who will be selected as new members. References * Doctor QIAN Bingyi.

The Sioux Quartzite is a Proterozoic quartzite that is found in the region around the intersection of Minnesota, South Dakota, and Iowa, and correlates with other rock units throughout the upper midwestern and southwestern United States. It was formed by braided river deposits, and its correlative units are thought to possibly define a large sedimentary wedge that once covered the passive margin on the then-southern side of the North American craton. In human history, it provided the catlinite, or pipestone, that was used by the Plains Indians to carve ceremonial pipes. With the arrival of Europeans, it was heavily quarried for building stone, and was used in many prominent structures in Sioux Falls, South Dakota and shipped to construction sites around the Midwest. Sioux Quartzite has been and continues to be quarried in Jasper, Minnesota at the Jasper Stone Company and Quarry, which itself was posted to the National Register of Historic Places on January 5, 1978.National Register of Historic Places, Jasper Stone Company and Quarry Jasper, Minnesota contains many turn- of-the-century quartzite buildings, including the school, churches and several other public and private structures, mostly abandoned. Geology The Sioux Quartzite is a red to pink Proterozoic quartzite. It is a thick stratigraphic unit (~3000 mMorey, B.

L., cd., Shorter contributions to the geology of the Sioux Quartzite (Early Proterozoic), southwestern Minnesota: Minnesota Geological Survey Report of Investigations 32, pp. 59‚Äì74.) that crops out in southwestern Minnesota, southeastern and south-central South Dakota, northwestern Iowa, and a small part of northeastern Nebraska.

E., 1975, Geology and Rb-Sr chronology of middle Precambrian rocks in eastern and central Wisconsin: Geological Society of America Bulletin, v. 86, pp. 1255‚Äì1265. This period in which the Sioux Quartzite and its correlative units were deposited is known as the Baraboo interval, in which high relative sea levels covered a large amount of North America.Dott, R. H., Jr., 1983, The Baraboo interval; A tale of red quartzite Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs, v. 15, p. 209. The Sioux quartzite was primarily formed by braided river deposits, of quartz arenite composition, with 95% of the rock being composed of rounded, fine to medium (0.125‚Äì0.5 mm) sand-size quartz grains. The rivers are believed to flow southeast, at a relatively shallow gradient. Its basal conglomerate is thought to be braided stream deposits that are more proximal to the source, and there is possible marine influence on the upper part of the unit ‚Äì this interpretation is supported by evidence of marine sediments (shales and banded iron formations) atop its correlative unit in Baraboo, Wisconsin.Ojakangas, R. W., and Weber, R. E., 1985, Petrography and paleocurrents of the Lower Proterozoic Sioux Quartzite, Minnesota and South Dakota, in Southwick, D. L., ed., Shorter contributions to the geology of the Sioux Quartzite (Early Proterozoic), southwestern Minnesota: Minnesota Geological Survey Report of Investigations 32, pp. 1‚Äì15. In addition, the unit contains ~1 meter beds of claystone, which are known as catlinite or pipestone, because these beds were used by the natives of the area to carve pipe bowls. It is thought that the Sioux Quartzite and its correlative units are parts of a once-laterally-extensive sedimentary wedge that covered the then-southern passive margin of the North American craton. Federal Building in Sioux Falls, South Dakota was constructed with Sioux quartzite from nearby quarries. The Sioux Quartzite is extremely resistant to erosion, and has formed a topographic high through most of Phanerozoic time. It was inundated by Phanerozoic seas during the periods of maximum sea level, and subsequent erosion removed these sedimentary units. For this reason, the only geologic units to sit atop the Sioux Quartzite are of Cretaceous age, deposited when a large portion of North America was covered by the Cretaceous Interior Seaway. Many present-day outcrops of Sioux Quartzite were exposed by glacial erosion during the Quaternary. Some of these have been dated with the cosmogenic radionuclides beryllium-10 and aluminium-26 to determine how long ago the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated from the Upper Midwest. These dates show that southwestern Minnesota was last covered in glacial ice at least 500,000 years ago.

Piedraia hortae is responsible for black piedra. References Category:Dothideomycetes genera Category:Animal fungal diseases Category:Capnodiales ","title":"Piedraia"},{"id":"20129793","text":"Piedraia hortae is a superficial fungus that exists in the soils of tropical and subtropical environments and affects both sexes of all ages. The fungus grows very slowly, forming dark hyphae, which contain chlamydoconidia cells and black colonies when grown on agar. Piedraia hortae is a dermatophyte and causes a superficial fungal infection known as black piedra, which causes the formation of black nodules on the hair shaft and leads to progressive weakening of the hair. The infection usually infects hairs on the scalp and beard, but other varieties tend to grow on pubic hairs. The infection is usually treated with cutting or shaving of the hair and followed by the application of anti-fungal and topical agents. The fungus is used for cosmetic purposes to darken hair in some societies as a symbol of attractiveness. Morphology When grown on agar at Piedraia hortae grows very slowly to form black-greenish, limited and pointed colonies. Piedraia hortae taken from infected hairs have dark brown nodules, which are made up of ascostroma. The nodules have a gritty feel, organized in a stromatic fashion and have a high concentration of chitin and melanoid pigments. The colonies produce a red pigment and remain smooth and covered with short aerial hyphae. Microscopically, P. hortae produces short, dark hyphae containing thick-walled resting cells. The ascomata consist of irregularly shaped pseudothecia that are black in colour. Each ascoma contains a single ascus containing eight ascospores. The ascospores are dark, curved and become very narrow at the ends forming whip-like appendages. Affected hairs develop stone-like black nodules affixed to the hair shaft that cause weakness of the hair. Infected hairs treated with potassium hydroxide fluoresce under ultraviolet light despite that the fungus itself does not normally fluoresce. Fluorescence of the piedra indicates secondary contamination by bacteria. Identification is easily achieved by microscopic examination of the hair nodules, and can be confirmed by sequence analysis of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region. Pathology Piedraia hortae causes the formation of nodules on the hair shaft, a clinical superficial disease commonly known as black piedra. Black piedra is usually seen in tropical regions and it usually targets humans of all ages and targets the scalp, moustache and occasionally pubic hair. The source of the infection is usually in soils, poor hygiene, long hair, cultural use of veils and the application of plant oils to wet hair favours the growth of the infection. Black piedra is a superficial fungal infection, which means that it is restricted to the stratum corneum and causes no inflammation. The infection of the hair shaft results in the formation of nodules on the scalp, moustache and pubic hair. The nodules are hard and gritty, which produce a metallic sound when the hair is combed. The nodules colonize the hair shaft, which causes progressive weakness of the hair and leads to breakage of the hair in severe cases, which can lead to hair loss and baldness. The fungus also has the potential to destroy the cuticular layers of the hair and move into the cortex. Piedraia hortae survives in the scalp is due to the slow rate of the keratin degradation near the cortex and the compact formation of the nodules and the hyphae are tightly packed in black piedra cases. The initial invasion of human hair by P. hortae is achieved by using an eroding hyphae, which force their way beneath or between the cuticular layer. The force applied between or beneath the hair cuticle arises from the growth of the fungus itself. The breakdown of keratin is mainly due to enzymatic processes and corresponds to the abundance of localized mitochondria. The breakdown of keratin begins with the cementing material and progresses to the cortex of the hair shaft. In the cortex two types of degradative patterns are produced which are either parallel or vertical to the axis hair shaft. The parallel pattern arises from hyphal separation of the external cortical layers. The vertical pattern is produced by direct hyphal penetration which creates channels that increase in size as the cortex degrades. =Treatment= The infection cannot easily be removed mechanically, although further proliferation of infection can be achieved by avoidance of moisture. Removal generally involves cutting or shaving of the hair, but chemical treatments may be similarly useful. For women some individuals use a fine comb to remove as much of the infection as possible and then they cut or shave their hair. This is then followed by the application of a sublimate solution in 60% alcohol solution to the scalp. Historical treatments have used alcoholic tinctures of heavy metals, such as mercury bichloride. The application of antifungal shampoos such as pyrithione zinc, formaldehyde and salicylic acid is effective against black piedra. Oral therapy with itraconazole or terbinafine also causes nodules to break down over time. Removal of affected hair and treatment with topical agents is also effective and results in very low recurrences rates. However, even in the absence of treatment, spontaneous remission may occur. Terbinafine has been used in the treatment. =Cosmetic uses= Black piedra is sometimes cultivated for cosmetic purposes due to social factors that favour a specific hair colour, which makes them more attractive in their society. Several Indian tribes located from Panama have been known to use several methods in order to darken the hair of albino individuals within their community. One of these methods is the cultivation of black piedra for an extensive period of time in the individuals hair. In Malaysia the nodules of black piedra are very attractive and women are encouraged to sleep with their hair buried in the soil to encourage growth of the black nodules. Similar taxa The genus Piedraia contains another species known as Piedraia quintanilhae, which is more common in chimpanzees than humans. It differs from P. hortae in terms of the ascospores do not have any attachments. Another species known as Trichosporon biegelii is commonly known to cause white piedra . White piedra is more common in temperate and semitropical climates, such as South America, Asia, Europe, Japan, and parts of the southern United States. Black piedra usually affects scalp hair, whereas white piedra is more commonly found in pubic hair, axillary hair, beards, moustaches, and eyelashes. White piedra affects horses and monkeys, in addition to humans and the nodules are white and brown in colour and can be easily detached from the hair shaft. White piedra is treated by using topical and antifungal agents, but a more effective approach is to use itraconazole therapy. Recent studies have shown that the black, lichen-colonizing fungus, Xanthoriicola physciae, is closely related to P. hortae.

He is the head of the Parliamentarians for Arthritis group and is active in the Parliamentary Sports Trust as a rugby player and referee. In a reshuffle in January 2013, Woodhouse was made a minister outside cabinet and was given the Immigration, Veteran's Affairs and associate transport portfolios. During his time in Parliament, Woodhouse voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Bill, a bill allowing same-sex couples to marry in New Zealand. During the Fifth National Government, Woodhouse served in various portfolios including immigration, transport, veteran's affairs, land information, workplace relations and safety, police, and the Accident Compensation Corporation. In August 2015, Michael Woodhouse caused controversy when he released a list of 57 high risk industries for his Health an Safety Reform Bill. This list was mocked by the Opposition because worm farming and mini golf were deemed \\"high risk\\", while dairy and cattle farming were not. Labour leader, Andrew Little, stated the new classifications were \\"overly complicated, ill thought out and rushed through to appease National Party backers, putting the lives of New Zealanders at risk\\". While Labour's spokesperson for Labour issues, Iain Lees-Galloway, said Woodhouse \\"can‚Äôt worm his way out of this. He will be forever ridiculed as the Minister who made killer worm farms safer but failed to protect people working in some of New Zealand's most dangerous industries\\".

In early August 2018, Woodhouse in his capacity as National health spokesperson called for National Health Targets to be a legal requirement in response to the Labour Party's proposed Child Poverty legislation. In late August 2018, Woodhouse objected to United States whistleblower Chelsea Manning's proposed tour of New Zealand in early September 2018, arguing that she should be banned due to her lack of remorse over her role in leaking sensitive US military documents to WikiLeaks. Since 25 March 2020, Woodhouse has been a member of the Epidemic Response Committee, a select committee that considers the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 17 June, Woodhouse claimed that a source had told him that two travelers, who tested positive for COVID-19, had made physical contact with others while traveling from Auckland to Wellington to attend a funeral. In response, the Ministry of Health confirmed that the two infected travelers had \\"five minutes\\" of limited contact with two friends during their journey. On 18 June, Woodhouse alleged that a homeless man had bluffed his way into a two-week stay in a five-star hotel being used as a COVID-19 isolation facility by pretending to have newly returned from overseas. On 23 June, after Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield told media that an investigation had found no evidence to support Woodhouse's claims and that the alleged incident was likely to be \\"an urban myth,\\" Woodhouse responded that he stood by his statements, saying \\"the absence of any evidence does not mean it did not occur.\\" On 11 August, RNZ reported that official investigations had concluded that a man with no fixed abode had spent time in managed isolation, but had done so after returning from Australia, and hence had been present legitimately. On 10 July, Woodhouse admitted that he had received private patient information from former National Party President Michelle Boag in late June, which had led to Boag's resignation from the National Party and fellow National MP Hamish Walker being stripped of his portfolios. Woodhouse confirmed that he had deleted the emails, stating that it was inappropriate to have leaked them. Woodhouse was criticised by Health Minister Chris Hipkins, who alleged that he had been \\"sitting on information\\" related to the recent COVID-19 leak. Following a leadership election within the National Party that was held on 15 July 2020, Woodhouse was stripped of his health spokesperson portfolio by newly elected leader Judith Collins, who gave the role to Shane Reti. Personal life Woodhouse is an avid rugby fan, having played for Otago in his youth. He has a wife Amanda and three children. An avid rugby follower, Woodhouse played age group rugby for Otago and South Island rep teams and premier rugby for Dunedin and Western Suburbs in Wellington. He also refereed 84 premier and approximately 20 representative colts and 'B' provincial matches. He also was a premier grade referee.

Early life He was born at Oporto, Portugal, on 12 Aug. 1791, the son of Edward Quillinan, an Irishman of a good but impoverished family, who had become a prosperous wine merchant at Oporto. His mother, whose maiden name was Ryan, died soon after her son had been sent, in 1798, to England, to be educated at Roman Catholic schools. Returning to Portugal, he entered his father's counting-house, but this distasteful employment ceased upon the French invasion under Jean-Andoche Junot in 1807, which obliged the family to seek refuge in England. Military service and early works After spending some time without any occupation, he entered the army as a cornet in a cavalry regiment, from which, after seeing some service at Walcheren, he passed into another regiment, stationed at Canterbury. A satirical pamphlet in verse, The Ball Room Votaries, involved him in a series of duels, and compelled him to exchange into the 3rd Dragoon Guards, with which he served through the latter portion of the Peninsular war. In 1814 he made his first serious essay in poetry by publishing Dunluce Castle, a Poem, which he followed with Stanzas by the author of Dunluce Castle (1814), and The Sacrifice of Isabel (a more important effort in 1816), and Elegiac Verses addressed to Lady Brydges in memory of her son, Grey Matthew Brydges (1817). In 1817 he married Jemima, second daughter of Sir Samuel Egerton Brydges and subsequently served with his regiment in Ireland. In 1819 Dunluce Castle attracted the notice of Thomas Hamilton the original \\"Morgan O'Doherty\\" of Blackwood's Magazine, who ridiculed it in a review entitled Poems by a Heavy Dragoon. Quillinan deferred his rejoinder until 1821, when he attacked John Wilson and John Gibson Lockhart, whom he erroneously supposed to be the writers, in his Retort Courteous, a satire largely consisting of passages from Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk, done into verse. The misunderstanding was dissipated through the friendly offices of Robert Pearse Gillies, and all parties became good friends. Later career In 1821 Quillinan retired from the army, and settled at Spring Cottage, between Rydal and Ambleside, and thus in the immediate neighbourhood of Wordsworth, whose poetry he had long devotedly admired. Scarcely was he established there when a tragic fate overtook his wife, who died from the effects of burns, 25 May 1822, leaving two daughters. Wordsworth was godfather of the younger daughter, and he wrote an epitaph on Mrs. Quillinan. Distracted with grief, Quillinan fled to the continent, and afterwards lived alternately in London, Paris, Portugal, and Canterbury, until 1841, when he married Wordsworth's daughter, Dora Wordsworth. The union encountered strong opposition on Wordsworth's part, not from dislike of Quillinan, but from dread of losing his daughter's society. He eventually submitted with a good grace, due to the persuasion of Isabella Fenwick, and became fully reconciled to Quillinan, who proved an excellent husband and son- in-law. In 1841 Quillinan published The Conspirators, a three-volume novel, embodying his recollections of military service in Spain and Portugal. In 1843 he appeared in Blackwood as the defender of Wordsworth against Walter Savage Landor, who had attacked his poetry in an imaginary conversation with Richard Porson, published in the magazine. Quillinan's reply was a cento of all the harsh pronouncements of the erratic critic respecting great poets, and the effect was to invalidate as a whole criticisms that might have been defensible individually. Landor dismissed his remarks as \\"Quill-inanities;\\" Wordsworth himself is said to have regarded the defence as indiscreet. In 1845 the delicate health of his wife induced Quillinan to travel with her for a year in Portugal and Spain, and the excursion produced a charming book from her pen. In 1846 he contributed an extremely valuable article to the Quarterly Review on Gil Vicente, the Portuguese dramatic poet. In 1847 Dora died, and four years later (8 July 1851) Quillinan himself died (at Loughrig Holme, Ambleside) of inflammation, occasioned by taking cold upon a fishing excursion; he was buried in Grasmere churchyard. His latter years had been chiefly employed in translations of Lu√≠s de Cam√µes' Lusiad, five books of which were completed, and of Alexandre Herculano's History of Portugal. The latter, also left imperfect, was never printed; the Lusiad was published in 1853 by John Adamson, another translator of Camoens. A selection from Quillinan's original poems, principally lyrical, with a memoir, was published in the same year by William Johnston, the editor of Wordsworth. Assessment Quillinan was a sensitive, irritable, but most estimable man. \\"All who know him,\\" says Southey, writing in 1830, \\"are very much attached to him.\\" \\"Nowhere,\\" says Johnston, speaking of his correspondence during his wife's hopeless illness, \\"has the writer of this memoir ever seen letters more distinctly marked by manly sense, combined with almost feminine tenderness.\\" Matthew Arnold in his Stanzas in Memory of Edward Quillinan, speaks of him as \\"a man unspoil'd, sweet, generous, and humane.\\" As an original poet his claims are of the slenderest; his poems would hardly have been preserved but for the regard due to his personal character and his relationship to Wordsworth. His version of the Lusiad, nevertheless, though wanting his final corrections, has considerable merit, and he might have rendered important service to two countries if he had devoted his life to the translation and illustration of Portuguese literature.

Krieglstein is the founder of a neo-Nietzschean philosophical school called Transcendental Perspectivism. Krieglstein's \\"philosophy of compassion\\" has been the subject of symposium lectures at many prominent conferences including the UNESCO section of the World Congress of Philosophy conference in Seoul Korea (August, 2008), the ISAIL \\"Fields of Conflict-Fields of Wisdom\\": 4th International Congress in Wuerzburg, Germany (May, 2008), the meeting of the American Philosophical Association in Washington D.C. (Symposium Chair: Sept. 2006), and the ISUD Fourth World Conference of the International Society for Universal Dialogue (Summer, 2001), among many others. Career =Academic background= Krieglstein was born in 1941 in Blatnice, (near Plze≈à), at the time an annexed part of Nazi Germany's Sudetenland (present-day Blatnice, Czech Republic). Following the post-war Expulsion of the Germans from Czechoslovakia, he relocated near Frankfurt, Germany. In the Sixties, Krieglstein was a student at the Frankfurt School in Germany, under the professorship of Theodor W. Adorno. In his first book, Krieglstein credits the roots of his passion for the transformative aspects of philosophy to the tutelage of Adorno. As a German Jew, Adorno returned to Germany almost immediately after WWII ended with the goal of challenging the indoctrination many university students had received in Hitler's youth education programs. Before moving to the United States, Krieglstein also studied at the Free University of Berlin. Following his studies in Germany, Krieglstein pursued his doctorate at the University of Chicago as a Fulbright Scholar and University Fellow. Krieglstein has held teaching positions at the University of Helsinki, Finland, and Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo. He currently is professor emeritus of philosophy and religious studies at the College of DuPage, where he was awarded the Most Outstanding Teacher Award in 2003 and the Distinguished Regional Humanities Educator Award from the Community College Humanities Association in 2008. In addition to his role as professor, Krieglstein is a course director at the Interuniversity Center in Dubrovnik, Croatia, and a board member of the International Society for Universal Dialogue. His philosophy of compassion is also finding an audience within the education reform movement, with symposium lectures at AEPL \\"Reclaiming the Wisdom Tradition for Education\\" conference in Northern California (May, 2008), the NISOD International Conference on Teaching and Leadership Excellence in Austin, TX (May, 2007), and the CCHA Creating Communities Conference hosted by the University of Chicago (Nov, 2006). =Actor and director= While at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main, Krieglstein rose to prominence in theater when he was appointed as director of the avant-garde theater, Die Neue B√ºhne, at the Goethe University. While writing for the theater's paper, he interviewed members of The Living Theater including Jerzy Grotowski, and was fortunate enough to study mime under Marceau student Jeanne Winkler. An ISAIL biography notes that \\"his black light production of Kafka's The Metamorphosis was performed over two hundred times at both European and American festivals.\\" After emigrating to the US and while teaching at Western Michigan University in 1976, he founded and directed a small rural theater company in Lawrence, Michigan known as the Whole Arts Theater, which later moved to Kalamazoo. Michigan's official tourism site describing Krieglstein's founding of the Whole Art Theater. More recently, Krieglstein has shifted his acting focus to film. In the past few years, he has worked on several independent films including 'Urban Ground Squirrels' by Wiggle Puppy Productions, Chicago (Mark Krieglstein, 2002) and the internationally known 'Light Denied' by Delos Films, Warsaw (Pawe≈Ç Kuczy≈Ñski, 2008), along with a few smaller films. Personal life Werner and Maryann Krieglstein posing on their Michigan farm in the late 1970s Krieglstein is married to Maryann Krieglstein. After attaining his PhD, the two lived in a few places around the world including Finland and Morocco before settling down on an organic farm in Lawrence, Michigan. While farming, he continued to teach and pursue acting in nearby Kalamazoo. In 1990, Krieglstein moved with his family to Glen Ellyn, Illinois, home to the College of DuPage where he would begin his almost 20 year professorship. Together, Maryann and Werner have five sons and one grandson: Robin (07/01/71), married to Suruchi have a son named Milan (03/14/09); Mark (02/25/75); Daniel (03/31/79), married to Andrea Trocchio; Thomas (12/05/80); and Michael (09/02/84).  Philosophy  Transcendental perspectivism is a hybrid philosophy blending Friedrich Nietzsche's perspectivism and the utopian ideals of the transcendentalist movement. Transcendental perspectivism challenges Nietzsche's claim that there is no absolute truths while fully accepting his observation that all truth can only be known in the context of one's perception. This is accomplished through an appreciation of the emotional relationship between two perceptions (the \\"perceiver\\" and the \\"other\\"). In the simplest of terms, a transcendental truth can only be known when two individuals come to agree on the truth by either force or cooperation, thus working together to build a shared reality.

Its molecular formula is CH3(CH2)15CO2H. Classified as an odd-chain fatty acid, it occurs as a trace component of the fat and milkfat of ruminants, but it does not occur in any natural animal or vegetable fat at high concentrations. For example, it comprises only 2.2% of the fats from the fruit of the durian species Durio graveolens. However, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, there were numerous reports of the acid being found in natural fats in significant amounts. Most likely, these were cases of misidentifying a eutectic mixture of palmitic and stearic acids.–ß—ë—Ç –∏–ª–∏ –Ω–µ—á–µ—Ç? –ó–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –æ—á–µ—Ä–∫–∏ –ø–æ —Ö–∏–º–∏–∏, pages 116-120 Salts and esters of margaric acid are called heptadecanoates.  Semiochemistry  For many species, margaric acid plays a role as a semiochemical - specifically it possesses pheromonic and allomonic properties. Margaric acid has been identified in the subcaudal gland secretions of the European badger (Meles meles) and in the occipital gland secretions of male Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus) where it is one of the many pheromonic chemicals responsible for aiding in the finding and selection of mates.

Russell remained politically active to the end of his life, writing to and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes. Some maintain that during his last few years he gave his youthful followers too much license and that they used his name for some outlandish purposes that a more attentive Russell would not have approved. There is evidence to show that he became aware of this when he fired his private secretary, Ralph Schoenman, then a young firebrand of the radical left. =Pacifism, war, and nuclear weapons= Russell was originally a Liberal Imperialist but in 1901 converted to anti-imperialism, pacifism and a Pro-Boer standpoint with regards to the Second Boer War.The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell, George Allen and Unwin Ltd., 1971, p.146. He resisted specific wars on the grounds that they were contrary to the interests of civilisation, and thus immoral. On the other hand, his 1915 article on \\"The Ethics of War,\\" he defended wars of colonisation on the same utilitarian grounds: he felt conquest was justified if the side with the more advanced civilisation could put the land to better use. Russell's activism against British participation in World War I led to fines, a loss of freedom of travel within Britain, and the non-renewal of his fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, and he was eventually sentenced to prison in 1918 on the tenuous grounds that he had interfered in British foreign policy ‚Äì he had argued that British workers should be wary of the United States Army, for it had experience in strike-breaking. He was released after serving six months, but was still closely supervised until the end of the war. Russell contended that \\"the abolition of private ownership of land and capital is a necessary step toward any world in which the nations are to live at peace with one another\\".http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Philosophy/RBwritings/ProposedRdFree/chap-6.html In 1943 Russell called his stance towards warfare \\"relative political pacifism\\"‚Äîhe held that war was always a great evil, but in some particularly extreme circumstances (such as when Adolf Hitler threatened to take over Europe) it might be a lesser of multiple evils. In the years leading to World War II, he supported the policy of appeasement; but by 1940 he acknowledged that to preserve democracy, Hitler had to be defeated. This same reluctant value compromise was shared by his acquaintance A.A. Milne. Russell consistently opposed the continued existence of nuclear weapons ever since their first use. However, on 20 November 1948, in a public speech at Westminster School, addressing a gathering arranged by the New Commonwealth, Russell shocked some observers with comments that seemed to suggest a preemptive nuclear strike on the Soviet Union might be justified. Russell apparently argued that the threat of war between the United States and the Soviet Union would enable the United States to force the Soviet Union to accept the Baruch Plan for international atomic energy control. (Earlier in the year he had written in the same vein to Walter W. Marseille.) Russell felt this plan \\"had very great merits and showed considerable generosity, when it is remembered that America still had an unbroken nuclear monopoly.\\" (Has Man a Future?, 1961). Nicholas Griffin of McMaster University, in his book The Selected Letters of Bertrand Russell: The Public Years, 1914‚Äì1970, interpreted Russell's wording as advocating not the actual use of the atom bomb, but merely its diplomatic use as a massive source of leverage over the actions of the Soviets. Griffin's interpretation was disputed by Nigel Lawson; the former British Chancellor, who was present at the speech. Lawson claims it was quite clear that Russell was advocating an actual first strike, a view that is consistent with that reported by Hermann Bondi in Bondi's autobiography (Science, Churchill and Me, 1990, p60) recounting Russell's views from the time when Russell and Bondi were fellows of Trinity College in Cambridge. Whichever interpretation is correct, Russell later relented, instead arguing for mutual disarmament by the nuclear powers, possibly linked to some form of world government. In 1955, Russell released the Russell-Einstein Manifesto, co-signed by Albert Einstein and nine other leading scientists and intellectuals, a document which led to the first of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs in 1957. In 1957-58, Russell became the first president of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which advocated unilateral nuclear disarmament by Britain. He resigned two years later when the CND would not support civil disobedience, and formed the Committee of 100. In September 1961 he was imprisoned for a week under an act of 1361 for refusing to call off a huge ban-the-bomb demonstration at the Ministry of Defence organised by the Committee of 100. He served the sentence in the hospital of Brixton Prison. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Russell sent telegrams to US President John F. Kennedy, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, the UN Secretary- General U Thant and British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. His telegrams were greatly critical of Kennedy, who he had already singled out earlier as \\"more dangerous than Hitler\\", and tolerant of Khrushchev. Khrushchev replied with a long letter, published by the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS, which was mainly addressed to Kennedy and the Western world. Increasingly concerned about the potential danger to humanity arising from nuclear weapons and other scientific discoveries, he also joined with Einstein, Robert Oppenheimer, Joseph Rotblat and other eminent scientists of the day to establish the World Academy of Art and Science which was formally constituted in 1960. The Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation and its publishing imprint Spokesman Books began work in 1963 to carry forward Russell's work for peace, human rights and social justice. Russell criticised the official account of the assassination of John F. Kennedy in \\"16 Questions on the Assassination,\\" 1964. Korea and Vietnam He began public opposition to US policy in Vietnam with a letter to The New York Times dated 28 March 1963. By the autumn of 1966, he had completed the manuscript War Crimes in Vietnam. Then, using the American justifications for the Nuremberg Trials, Russell, along with Jean-Paul Sartre, organised what he called an international War Crimes Tribunal, the Russell Tribunal. Russell supported Korean nationalism, referring to North Koreans and South Koreans as \\"cousins\\". =Communism, anarchism and socialism= Russell was, prior to being a socialist, a Georgist.Autobiography of Bertrand Russell In 1914 he wrote to Lady Ottoline Morrell saying \\"It is clear the Socialists are the hope of the world\\". Russell expressed support for guild socialism.\\"Review: Bertrand Russell on Socialism\\" He was also an admirer of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eduard Bernstein. Russell expressed great hope in \\"the Communist experiment.\\" However, when he visited the Soviet Union and met Vladimir Lenin in 1920, he was unimpressed with the system in place. On his return he wrote a critical tract, The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism. He was \\"infinitely unhappy in this atmosphere‚Äîstifled by its utilitarianism, its indifference to love and beauty and the life of impulse.\\" Although critical of its implementation in Soviet Russia, he still believed \\"that Communism is necessary to the world.\\" He believed Lenin to be similar to a religious zealot, cold and possessing \\"no love of liberty.\\" In the 1922 and 1923 general elections Russell stood as a Labour Party candidate in the Chelsea constituency, but only on the basis that he knew he was extremely unlikely to be elected in such a safe Conservative seat, and he was not on either occasion. He was strongly critical of Joseph Stalin's regime, and referred to Marxism as a \\"system of dogma.\\"Bertrand Russell, Unpopular Essays (1950), p.19, Simon and Schuster Between 1945 and 1947, together with A. J. Ayer and George Orwell, he contributed a series of articles to Polemic, a short-lived British \\"Magazine of Philosophy, Psychology, and Aesthetics\\" edited by the ex-Communist Humphrey Slater.Art-Historical Notes: \\"Where are the Hirsts of the 1930s now?\\" The Independent, 13 November 1998 by David BuckmanAbsent Minds: Intellectuals in Britain by Stefan Collini Oxford University Press, 2006 , 978-0-19-929105-2 Russell was a consistent enthusiast for democracy and world government, and he advocated the establishment of a democratic international government in some of the essays collected in In Praise of Idleness (1935), and also in Has Man a Future? (1961). Russell wrote of Michel Bakunin writing \\"we do not find in Bakunin's works a clear picture of the society at which he aimed, or any argument to prove that such a society could be stable.\\" Russell did not believe that an anarchist society was \\"realizable\\" but that \\"it cannot be denied that Kropotkin presents it with extraordinary persuasiveness and charm.\\" =Women's suffrage= As a young man, Russell was a member of the Liberal Party and wrote in favour of women's suffrage. In his 1910 pamphlet, Anti-Suffragist Anxieties, Russell wrote that some men opposed suffrage because they \\"fear that their liberty to act in ways that are injurious to women will be curtailed.\\" In May 1907, Russell stood for Parliament as a woman's suffrage candidate in Wimbledon, but was not elected. =Sexuality= Russell wrote against Victorian notions of morality. Marriage and Morals (1929) expressed his opinion that sex between a man and woman who are not married to each other is not necessarily immoral if they truly love one another, and advocated \\"trial marriages\\" or \\"companionate marriage\\", formalised relationships whereby young people could legitimately have sexual intercourse without being expected to remain married in the long term or to have children (an idea first proposed by Judge Ben Lindsey). This was enough to raise vigorous protests and denunciations against him during his visit to the United States shortly after the book's publication. Russell was also one of the first intellectuals to advocate open sex education and widespread access to contraception. He also advocated easy divorce, but only if the marriage had produced no children ‚Äì Russell's view was that parents should remain married but tolerant of each other's sexual infidelity, if they had children. This reflected his life at the time ‚Äì his second wife Dora was openly having an affair, and would soon become pregnant by another man, but Russell was keen for their children John and Kate to have a \\"normal\\" family life. Russell was also an active supporter of the Homosexual Law Reform Society, being one of the signatories of A.E. Dyson's 1958 letter to The Times calling for a change in the law regarding male homosexual practices, which were partly legalised in 1967, when Russell was still alive. =Race= As with his views on religion, which developed considerably throughout his long life, Russell's views on the matter of race did not remain fixed. By 1951, Russell was a vocal advocate of racial equality and intermarriage; he penned a chapter on \\"Racial Antagonism\\" in New Hopes for a Changing World (1951), which read: Passages in some of his early writings support birth control. On 16 November 1922, for instance, he gave a lecture to the General Meeting of Dr. Marie Stopes's Society for Constructive Birth Control and Racial Progress on \\"Birth Control and International Relations,\\" in which he described the importance of extending Western birth control worldwide; his remarks anticipated the population control movement of the 1960s and the role of the United Nations. Another passage from early editions of his book Marriage and Morals (1929), which Russell later claimed to be referring only to environmental conditioning, and which he significantly modified in later editions, reads: However, in 1932 he condemned the \\"unwarranted assumption\\" that \\"Negroes are congenitally inferior to white men\\" (Education and the Social Order, Chap. 3). Responding in 1964 to a correspondent's inquiry, \\"Do you still consider the Negroes an inferior race, as you did when you wrote Marriage and Morals?\\", Russell replied: Eugenics Russell laid out his views about eugenics with a full chapter on the topic in his book Marriage and Morals. He expressed agreement with the basic idea, while criticizing specific views and positions eugenicists held (particularly a strong class bias). Russell accepted a forcer sterilization policy for negative eugenics, but only that of \\"mental defectives\\", condemning some laws for being overly broad. He also cautioned that eugenics policies had to account for scientific evidence, such as not making claims that all criminal behavior had genetic causes when psychology indicated otherwise. In terms of positive eugenics, he felt that free education should be provided for, to help the more intelligent people from poorer means to achieve earlier so they could have more children. Russell also acknowledge the difficulty of deciding what desirable traits are, and that tradeoffs can exist (e.g. to breed for strength might diminish intelligence). He also acknowledged that to practice eugenics would entail a radical disruption of the family, feeling that a select group from the population might be set apart solely to breed in the future. While finding this idea repugnant, he though it might nonetheless be effective. Discussing \\"race\\" eugenics, he held that some \\"races\\" were innately inferior (for instance the Native Americans) yet felt the prevalent racist views were largely an excuse for chauvinism, and dismissed concerns about white people being outbred by East Asians. He felt that in the future people might well select sexual partners for procreation voluntarily due to eugenic considerations. Russell felt certain eugenics views would win out in the future and become law. He conceded that it was repugnant to people and a \\"scientific tyranny\\" could arise, but felt this would be better than religious tyranny.Bertrand Russell, Marriage and Morals, pp. 254-74, (1929) Influence on society Russell often characterised his moral and political writings as lying outside the scope of philosophy, but Russell's admirers and detractors are often more acquainted with his pronouncements on social and political matters, or what some (e.g., biographer Ray Monk) have called his \\"journalism,\\" than they are with his technical, philosophical work. There is a marked tendency to conflate these matters, and to judge Russell the philosopher on what he himself would certainly consider to be his non- philosophical opinions. Russell often cautioned people to make this distinction. Beginning in the 1920s, Russell wrote frequently for The Nation on changing morals, nuclear disarmament and literature. In 1965, he wrote that the magazine \\"...has been one of the few voices which has been heard on behalf of individual liberty and social justice consistently throughout its existence.\\"Katrina Vanden Heuvel The Nation 1865‚Äì1990, p. 136, Thunder's Mouth Press, 1990 Paul McCartney, a member of The Beatles has said that after he met with Russell at his house and discussed the Vietnam war with him, McCartney inspired John Lennon and the band to take an anti-war stance.

Operation Seabight, or Sea Bight, is the codename used to describe the tracking and eventual seizure of up to ‚Ç¨750 million of cocaine off the Irish coast in November 2008, originally thought to have been the largest such haul in the history of Ireland and one of the largest in Europe in 2008. The figures were later revised to show that this was in fact the second largest haul in Irish history. The seizure took place off the south-west coast and eclipsed the discovery of ‚Ç¨440 million of cocaine near Mizen Head in July 2007. A yacht containing more than seventy bales of the substance was seized by a team of European anti-drugs agencies led by Irish authorities. Three men were also apprehended and later each was sentenced to ten years in jail. The seizure came just one day after the fourth man involved in Ireland's previous record haul in 2007 was sentenced to ten years imprisonment. of cocaine valued at ‚Ç¨440 million washed up on the Cork coast near Mizen Head following an attempted trafficking scam that failed when one of the men filled their petrol-powered motor engine with diesel. The inflatable launch overturned and dumped sixty-two bales of cocaine into the sea. Three of the men involved in the operation were sentenced earlier in 2008 for a total of eighty-five years. Etymology Operation Seabight received its name from the Porcupine Seabight, Porcupine Bank near international fishing grounds where the seizure took place. Background The yacht set sail from Trinidad before being seized off the south-western Irish coast. The seizure was masterminded by the Lisbon-based anti-trafficking body, Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre ‚Äì Narcotics (MAOC-N), which is staffed by law enforcement personnel from Ireland, United Kingdom, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, France and Italy. The centre targets aeroplanes and sea vessels, such as private ships, cruisers and yachts, mainly from South America, Latin America and West Africa. The operation has previously identified smuggling routes which use West Africa as a staging post for illegal substances before shipping them to Europe. A yacht containing seventy bales of the substance was seized by a team of European anti-drugs agencies led by the Irish. The yacht, named Dances with Waves, had set sail from Trinidad more than a month earlier. MAOC-N tracked it across the Atlantic Ocean before the Irish Naval Service patrol ship L√â Niamh moved in around off the coast of West Cork at around 11:00 UTC on 6 November 2008. The yacht, registered in Britain until July and then de-registered, was escorted into Castletownbere Harbour in West Cork by the Irish patrol ship L√â R√≥is√≠n early on 7 November 2008. Garda√≠ (the Irish police) removed the 70 bales of cocaine from the vessel and garda technical experts examined it. The haul was taken to local garda stations and later removed to the Department of Justice Forensic Science Laboratory at Garda Headquarters. It later emerged that the yacht was on the verge of capsizing when naval officers swooped on the vessel, with the seventy bales almost being washed into the sea. Authorities were forced to board the ship in \\"horrendous weather conditions\\" to prevent a potential loss of evidence as swells swirled in the background. The yacht was seized in the midst of a force seven gale which delayed its onshore arrival by seven hours. The patrol ship L√â Orla was deployed to search for bales of the drug while monitoring shipping to ensure they didn't recover any of the haul from the seaIrish navy, coast guard seize flotilla of cocaine ‚Äì CBC news courtesy of the Associated Press Substance Initial tests indicate the cocaine seized is 80% pure, 5% more potent than the ‚Ç¨440 million Dunlough Bay haul of 2007. According to one source, the average purity of Irish street cocaine is (presumably currently) just 10%, although an older source (data for 1999) states that cocaine purity across Europe is typically 55% to 70%, with Ireland being exceptionally low at 41%. Street prices for cocaine in both the US and Europe have dropped consistently over the last twenty years, indicating supply in this period has outstripped demand. Convicts Three male British nationals, initially reported to be aged between 44 and 52, were detained and questioned by garda√≠ in two separate garda stations in Bantry and Bandon, County Cork. The men were taken ashore at the small fishing port of Castletownbere. The three, later named as 49-year-old Philip Doo and 40-year- old David Mufford (both from Devon, England) and 42-year-old Christopher Wiggins (with an address on Spain's Costa del Sol), appeared before a special sitting of the District Court in Clonakilty, County Cork on 8 November 2008. They were charged with possession of cocaine knowing the drug was to be imported into a country other than Ireland. No application for bail was made and the men were remanded in custody to appear in Kinsale court again on 13 November 2008. The damaged yacht, believed bound for Liverpool, remains in Castletownbere. Searches of its logs, charts and navigation computers continue to find evidence that would prove its link to Spanish-based British drugs gang members. The bulk of the cocaine consignment was due for European markets. The Daily Star reported that \\"the drugs were almost certainly destined for British dealers to sell in pubs and clubs ahead of the Christmas party season.\\" The three men were each sentenced to ten years in jail on 8 May 2009. Notes * On 6 November 2008, ‚Ç¨750 million was the equivalent of almost ¬£ 609 million and a little over US$. * The ‚Ç¨750 million figure was based on the usual law enforcement estimate for a sub-gram quantity heavily cut. Based on the estimated street value of ‚Ç¨30‚Äì33,000 per kg, the 1875 kg would be worth anything from ‚âà ‚Ç¨56‚Äì60 million.

It has a wide spectrum of cytolytic activity. It is among other toxins produced by S. aureus and is part of the phenol-soluble modulin peptide family. Its alpha-helical, amphipathic structure gives it detergent-like properties, allowing it to disrupt and attach to the cytoplasmic membrane of a cell non-specifically, without a receptor, and integrate into the membrane. Delta toxin degrades the membrane on contact and forms short-lived pores, causing cell lysis and subsequent cell death.  Structure  S. aureus delta toxin is encoded for by the hld gene. The hld gene, of which the 3‚Äô end encodes for delta toxin, is involved in the accessory gene regulator (agr) system. This system controls the signaling and creation of cell-associated and secreted virulence factors. Delta toxin is also secreted from S. aureus without a signal peptide, but the toxin itself has been speculated to make an effective signal peptide. The S. aureus delta toxin molecule has been speculated to oligomerize and form cation-selective ion channels in the membrane for use other than cell lysis by the toxin. The channel is proposed to be formed by six delta toxin molecules in a hexagonal arrangement.  Function  Staphylococcus aureus delta toxin is a phenol-soluble modulin peptide. Because of this, the cytotoxins that are produced upon a S. aureus infection, including delta toxin, are proinflammatory molecules. Delta toxin is also a chemoattractant for leukocytes, leading to a surge of cytokines such as interleukin-8 from neutrophils at an infection site. Delta toxin molecules activate a G-protein-coupled receptor expressed in leukocytes called formyl- peptide receptor 2 (FPR2), which binds metabolites to inhibit and lower inflammation. Thus, delta toxin molecules trigger inflammation that needs to be modulated by FPR2. Delta toxin also has moderate cytolytic abilities to lyse red and white blood cells through the use of short-lived pores in the cytoplasmic membrane. The toxin then uses host tissue as nutrients required for further S. aureus bacteria growth. Delta toxin specifically causes mast cell degranulation, contributing to allergic reactions of the skin like atopic dermatitis. This reaction is only caused by delta toxin, rather than the other toxins produced by S. aureus, proving that PSM peptides have evolved to fulfill different roles in pathogenesis. PSMs, like S. aureus delta toxin, can prevent the activation and proliferations of CD4+ T cells, depending on interleukin-10 and TFG-beta activations. This would result in a down regulation of the adaptive immune response, potentially increasing pathogenic tolerance. This is a hypothesis as to why S. aureus is so virulent; S. aureus bacteria are able to modulate the organism‚Äôs immune system to evade it. Delta toxin is quite heat-stable, unlike S. aureus alpha and beta toxins. However, the addition of lecithin specifically prevents delta toxin from lysing cells. Delta toxin activity can also both enhanced and prevented with saturated, straight-chain fatty acids of varying lengths. Phospholipids 13 to 19 carbons in length enhanced the lytic activity of delta toxin, whereas those that were 21 to 23 carbons long were inhibitory. The length of the fatty acid chain could be related to the binding of the toxin to the membrane to be effective, as those phospholipids with longer tails prevent the toxin from getting close enough to the membrane.

At that time, headquarters was relocated while the building continued its function as the park's primary visitor center. Today the main level of the building serves as the visitor center; the basement level has public restrooms, museum storage, interpreter's office, library, storage for search and rescue and first aid equipment and supplies, and a fuel oil furnace. The upper level, originally designed for use as a bedroom, is now used for storage and houses an evaporative cooler. Custodian's Residence The custodian's residence was designed by the NPS Landscape Division under the direction of Chief Landscape Architect Thomas Chalmers Vint and constructed in 1931 by a private contractor, a Mr. Cummings of Deadwood, South Dakota. The building first served as the residence of the monument's second custodian, George C. Crowe. The original structure had five rooms: living room, bedroom, breakfast nook kitchen, and bathroom. Designed by the Architect Edward A. Nickel, NPS Branch of Plans and Design, and executed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (Camp NM-1, 6th Period), the fire hose house was constructed as ECW Project #17. Work was completed by August 10, 1937, \\"except for shelves,\\" according to the hand-written note on the architectural plans. The fire hose house was designed and used to house the fire hydrant and to store the monument's hose and fire fighting equipment. It has been used for that purpose since 1937.

Seasonal subseries plots involves the extraction of the seasons from a time series into a subseries. Based on a selected periodicity, it is an alternative plot that emphasizes the seasonal patterns are where the data for each season are collected together in separate mini time plots. Seasonal subseries plots enables the underlying seasonal pattern to be seen clearly, and also shows the changes in seasonality over time. Especially, it allows to detect changes between different seasons, changes within a particular season over time. However, this plot is only useful if the period of the seasonality is already known. In many cases, this will in fact be known. For example, monthly data typically has a period of 12. If the period is not known, an autocorrelation plot or spectral plot can be used to determine it. If there is a large number of observations, then a box plot may be preferable. Definition Seasonal sub-series plots are formed by * Vertical axis: response variable * Horizontal axis: time of year; for example, with monthly data, all the January values are plotted (in chronological order), then all the February values, and so on. The horizontal line displays the mean value for each month over the time series. The analyst must specify the length of the seasonal pattern before generating this plot. In most cases, the analyst will know this from the context of the problem and data collection. Importance It is important to know when analyzing a time series if there is a significant seasonality effect. The seasonal subseries plot is an excellent tool for determining if there is a seasonal pattern. The seasonal subseries plot can provide answers to the following questions: * Do the data exhibit a seasonal pattern? * What is the nature of the seasonality? * Is there a within-group pattern (e.g., do January and July exhibit similar patterns)? * Are there any outliers once seasonality has been accounted for? * Is the seasonality changing over time?https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/1 Practically, seasonal subseries plots are often inspected as a preliminary screening tool. They allow visual inferences to be drawn from data prior to modelling and forecasting.

The Department of Education funds the academic portion of the students' education, while the music program is funded by private donations through Kaufman Music Center. Operations Intended for children with high musical potential, Special Music School provides a rich musical and demanding academic education for grades K-12 through an integrated curriculum with a primary focus on music. In the lower and middle school's children have two private lessons per week in piano, cello, violin, flute, French horn, trumpet, trombone, percussion, or clarinet, as well as classes in music theory, chorus, and movement.http://insideschools.org/index12.php?fso=98&all;=y Three quarters of the students' time is spent on academic subjects. The school has partnerships with the National Dance Institute, the Center for Educational Innovation, New Visions for Public Schools, Studio in a School, Teachers College, Columbia University and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Special Music School also has a high school at the Martin Luther King Jr. Educational Campus on the Upper West Side, with a music curriculum that emphasizes the development of the student as a musician for the 21st century. With the establishment of the high school extension, Special Music School High School is the city‚Äôs only K-12 school that teaches music as a core subject. The music program covers the subjects of music theory, music history, and music technology. SMS had their first high school graduating class in 2017 with 100% graduation and college success rate. Students from all five boroughs of New York City are eligible to apply for admission, across all grades in lower and upper schools, which is by audition. Admission is extremely competitive, and the lower school kindergarten class gets approximately 700 applicants for 15 spaces. The total enrollment for all grades (K-12) is approximately 315 students. SMS consistently ranks among the top NYC public schools, based on student academic performance on New York State assessments. History The school was founded in 1996 and originally called The Special Music School of America. Inspired by the \\"spets-shkola,\\" special music school system of the former Soviet Union, many original members of the music faculty are Russian- conservatory trained musicians. In the fall of 2006 Special Music School established the after-school Young Artist Program for grades 9‚Äì12. It offers music students intensive after-school study courses. Each week students have classes covering literature and composition, music theory, and ear-training. Students also perform in chamber music and solo recitals. In 2005, former Special Music School Director Jenny Undercofler founded Face the Music, initially an 8-member after school music ensemble, and now NYC's only \\"alt classical\\" teen ensemble composed of 75 students from music students in the tri-state area aged 10 to 18. In 2011 ASCAP awarded its Aaron Copland Award to both Face the Music and Jenny Undercofler. Sports There are no sports teams for K-8 students, who are discouraged from joining sports teams outside of school. Instead, students are encouraged and expected to devote most of their extracurricular time to practicing their instrument, joining high-level music ensembles in the city and/or making use of Kaufman Music Center's Lucy Moses School classes as well as concerts at Merkin Concert Hall. However, in high school, Special Music School offers students the opportunity to participate in many different sports.

He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly from 1931 to 1934 and of the Australian House of Representatives from 1934 to 1940, representing both the state and federal versions of the seat of Denison. Early career Mahoney was born at Railton, Tasmania and was educated at Latrobe. He worked at the Mount Bischoff mine, where he became a delegate of the Federated Mining Employees Association, and later worked as a builder's painter. He was secretary of the Labor Party's Denison league in the early 1920s, was a Tasmanian delegate to the party's All Australia Congress and nominated for state Labor preselection in 1922. He rose through the trade union movement, and was president of the Zinc Workers' Union and secretary and trades hall delegate of the Painters' Union by the mid-1920s; he had also become secretary of the Operative Bricklayers' Union by the time of his election to parliament. In 1922 he was expelled from the Labor Party along with Edmund Dwyer-Gray for disloyalty; Mahoney was alleged to have associated with people who had opposed endorsed Labor candidates, and who had endorsed direct action and \\"go slow\\" tactics and supported the Industrial Workers of the World in his presence. He made annual appeals and requests for readmission to state conferences and state and federal executives between 1922 and 1928, but was unsuccessful on each occasion. In 1925 he unsuccessfully contested that year's state election as an Industrial Labor candidate against the endorsed Labor candidate, which resulted in his expulsion from the Trades Hall Council. He also contested the 1928 state election as an Independent Labor candidate in light of the continual refusal of his requests for readmission and polled well, but was again defeated. He was eventually readmitted to the party in December 1928, although on the basis that he did not have continuity of membership, preventing him from standing for party endorsement in the immediate future. In 1930, he was elected president of the Denison branch of the Labor Party. In state and federal parliament In 1931 he was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly as a Labor member for Denison. He was particularly outspoken about issues relating to the unemployed and destitute in his time in state parliament. He lost his seat at the 1934 state election. Four months after his state defeat, he contested and narrowly won the federal seat of Denison at the 1934 federal election, defeating United Australia Party MP Arthur Beck. He immediately announced that he would stand \\"four-square behind\\" leader James Scullin in a party still dealing with the aftermath of the 1931 Labor split. He was re-elected in 1937. Mahoney was defeated by UAP candidate Arthur Beck in 1940. Later career He returned to his old role as secretary of the Painters' Union after his election defeat. He was appointed to the public service role of Tasmanian rehabilitation employment officer for returned soldiers early 1943, which met with strong protests from the Returned and Services League. He sought preselection to recontest his old seat at the 1943 federal election, but the state executive refused to endorse his candidacy. In May 1943, Mahoney announced that he would contest the seat anyway, declared the preselection decision \\"the greatest outrage ever committed by a Labor executive on any man in the Labor movement\\" and stated that he \\"accept[ed] it as an expulsion from the party. He cited \\"shocking victimisation\\" in his decision to run as an independent Labor candidate. He lost to the endorsed candidate, and in congratulating the victor, said he had been \\"weighted out\\" from the start. Mahoney sought readmittance to the Labor Party in March 1944 following his automatic removal for opposing an endorsed candidate, but was instead formally expelled. He applied again and was readmitted by the state conference in 1945. In 1950, Mahoney supported the proposed banning of the Communist Party of Australia at the Labor Party conference, declaring that Robert Menzies \\"should 'do the job'\\" and described communism as a \\"bogey brought about by the Menzies Government to crucify the trade union movement\\". Later that month, he was appointed president of the Building Trades Federation. He also remained secretary of the Operative Painters and Decorators Union until at least 1954. Mahoney died in Hobart in September 1955.

Midline shift is a shift of the brain past its center line. The sign may be evident on neuroimaging such as CT scanning. The sign is considered ominous because it is commonly associated with a distortion of the brain stem that can cause serious dysfunction evidenced by abnormal posturing and failure of the pupils to constrict in response to light. Midline shift is often associated with high intracranial pressure (ICP), which can be deadly. In fact, midline shift is a measure of ICP; presence of the former is an indication of the latter. Presence of midline shift is an indication for neurosurgeons to take measures to monitor and control ICP. Immediate surgery may be indicated when there is a midline shift of over 5 mm. The sign can be caused by conditions including traumatic brain injury,stroke, hematoma, or birth deformity that leads to a raised intracranial pressure.  Methods of Detection  This subdural hematoma/epidural hematoma (arrows) is causing midline shift of the brainDoctors detect midline shift using a variety of methods. The most prominent measurement is done by a computed tomography (CT) scan and the CT Gold Standard is the standardized operating procedure for detecting MLS. Since the midline shift is often easily visible with a CT scan, the high precision of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is not necessary, but can be used with equally adequate results. Newer methods such as bedside sonography can be used with neurocritical patients who cannot undergo some scans due to their dependence on ventilators or other care apparatuses. Sonography has proven satisfactory in the measurement of MLS, but is not expected to replace CT or MRI. Automated measurement algorithms are used for exact recognition and precision in measurements from an initial CT scan. A major benefit to using the automated recognition tools includes being able to measure even the most deformed brains because the method doesn‚Äôt depend on normal brain symmetry. Also, it lessens the chance of human error by detecting MLS from an entire image set compared to selecting the single most important slice, which allows the computer to do the work that was once manually done.  Structures of the Midline  Three main structures are commonly investigated when measuring midline shift. The most important of these is the septum pellucidum, which is a thin and linear layer of tissue located between the right and left ventricles. It is easily found on CT or MRI images due to its unique hypodensity. The other two important structures of the midline include the third ventricle and the pineal gland, which are both centrally located and caudal to the septum pellucidum. Identifying the location of these structures on a damaged brain compared to an unaffected brain is another way of categorizing the severity of the midline shift. The terms mild, moderate, and severe are associated with the extent of increasing damage.  Midline Shift in Diagnoses  Midline shift measurements and imaging has multiple applications. The severity of brain damage is determined by the magnitude of the change in symmetry. Another use is secondary screening to determine deviations in brain trauma at different times after a traumatic injury as well as initial shifts immediately after. The severity of shift is directly proportional to the likeliness of surgery having to be performed. The degree of MLS can also be used to diagnose the pathology that caused it. The MLS measurement can be used to successfully distinguish between a variety of intracranial conditions including acute subdural hematoma, malignant middle cerebral artery infarction, epidural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, chronic subdural hematoma, infarction, intraventrical hemorrhage, a combination of these symptoms, or the absence of pertinent damage altogether.

Trans. David R. Lachterman. ‚ÄúThe Idols of Self- Knowledge,‚Äù ‚ÄúOrdo Amoris,‚Äù ‚ÄúPhenomenology and the Theory of Cognition,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Theory of Three Facts,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIdealism and Realism‚Äù (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973) editor‚Äôs introduction, pp. xi-xiv. Scheler's style of phenomenology has been described by some scholars as ‚Äúapplied phenomenology‚Äù: an appeal to facts or ‚Äúthings in themselves‚Äù as always furnishing a descriptive basis for speculative philosophical concepts. One key source of just such a pattern of facts is expressed in Scheler‚Äôs descriptive mapping of human emotional life (the ‚ÄúStratification of Emotional Life‚Äù) as articulated in his seminal 1913‚Äì1916 work, Formalism in Ethics and Non-Formal Ethics of Values.Manfred S. Frings, Max Scheler: A Concise Introduction into the World of a Great Thinker (Milwaukee: Marquette University Press, 1996), p. 21.  Overview  The practical significance of Scheler's Stratification of Emotional Life is obvious in several respects and points of view. First, Scheler seems to be making a case in favor of what we might refer to today as Emotional Intelligence, as a portal to more ethical behavior and optimum personal development, similar to the ancient Greek concern for promoting virtuous character.Max Scheler ‚ÄúOrdo Amoris‚Äù, in Selected Philosophical Essays, trans. David R. Lachterman (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973), pp. 103-104. See also Plato‚Äôs Republic (the Soul). However quite unlike many of our modern attitudes and prejudices, emotional life ought not be viewed as simply a chaotic impediment to reason, but rather should be understood as a sort of ‚Äúsixth sense‚Äù having an informative objective core: what Scheler termed our Ordo Amoris (or ‚ÄúLogic of the Heart‚Äù).‚ÄúOrdo Amoris‚Äù, p. 117. Second, for Scheler values have true primacy as real inherent qualities discovered in things, people, situations and the like. Values and immanent emotive experience are co-extensive: ‚Äúthe plain fact is that we act vis-√†-vis values just as we do vis-√†-vis colors and sounds.‚Äù Max Scheler, Formalism in Ethics and Non-Formal Ethics of Values, trans. Manfred S. Frings and Richard L. Funk (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973), p. 174. Scheler's claim is that the correlates of feelings and emotions are values, just as the correlates of visual perception are colors and audio perceptions are sounds. If such qualities are present in a person's world, they tend to be apprehended. But the reverse is also true: the meanings ascribed to things, people, situations and the like are uniquely co-extensive with the subjective relativity of every person, as the \\"totality of acts of different kinds\\" Formalism, p. 383. having a unique qualitative direction Formalism, p. 385. and destiny.\\"Ordo Amoris\\", p. 106. As a value being and bearer of values every person is as unique as a snowflake. This is why Scheler's ethics is commonly referred as a Material Value-Ethics as opposed to a formal ethics (Immanuel Kant). Third, values are emotively intuited. The whole of \\"something\\" is intuited by consciousness before any of the parts can fully be rationally known or assimilated. Common expressions such as \\"ah ha\\", \\"love at first sight,\\" d√©j√† vu or \\"the cat's pajamas\\" sum up this basic idea. Values are realized though personal apprehensions (i.e. \\"attractions\\" and \\"repulsions\\") of positive (and negative) qualities discoverable through our own pre-thought, pre-willed acts of preference.Max Scheler, The Nature of Sympathy, trans. Peter Heath (Hamden: Shoe Sting Press, 1973), p. 153. Fourth, depth of emotion signals importance (intensity) of value, just as absence of feeling signals the lack. This depth structure found in emotive life correlates reciprocally to Scheler‚Äôs formulation of an upward vertical apriori hierarchy of values as forming the basis of an intuitive ethics inspired by love,Sympathy, p. 157 & 161\\\\. For Scheler, the introduction of Christian Love in history validated loving those perceived as ‚Äúlower‚Äù in stature than oneself, (i.e., the needy, the affirmed, the socially exploited and rejected, the different) in contrast to the classical Greek and Roman love which focused only what is higher or more powerful. With Christian love, our aiming higher leads to God which in turn leads to compassion and acceptance toward others and the world unlike ourselves as a work in progress, struggling and less than perfect, but beautiful and valued nonetheless. See also ‚ÄúFrings‚Äù pp. 126-127. emanating ultimately from the Divine.Sympathy, Chapter 11; ‚ÄúOrdo Amoris‚Äù, pp. 105-108; Formalism, p. 294. Also see Max Scheler, On the Eternal in Man.  Scheler's analysis of the strata of emotive life  For Scheler, human feelings, feeling states and emotions display a meaningful and progressive pattern of levels from our peripheral to the deeper more stable structures of personality.Formalism, p. 336. Scheler identified four Some Scholars focusing on Scheler‚Äôs later writings have come to posit a fifth value modality, values of utility, located between sensible and vital values. This is a debatable point as many scholars believe that Scheler never retraced his early formulations on the emotions and values. Also, in his early works Scheler did not identify a distinct class of feelings, feeling states or emotions associated with utility. In fact, Scheler maintained that the values of the useful always served values of the agreeable (Formalism., p. 94). Utility may very well better be interpreted and assimilated as a highly developed dimension of Vital Urge. distinct but interrelated strata found in human emotional life.Formalism, p. 332. At our most periphery we have sensible feelings (e.g., a tickle, an itch, a fragrance, a taste, pleasure, pain, hunger, thirst, intoxication‚Ä¶), which manifest in relative modes of joy and suffering. These feelings are shortest in duration, extended and localizable with reference to the lived-body, and are the most readily alterable and accessible through external means and stimuli.Formalism, pp. 333-338. Next we have vital feelings or feeling states of the unitary lived-body which are experienced as a unified field or whole (e.g., comfort, health, vigor, strength, tiredness, illness, weakness, advancing age, phantom limb phenomenon‚Ä¶), and which manifest intentionally as fear and hope.Formalism, pp. 338-342 & 335\\\\. Fear as a negative vital influence has the usual effect of blocking higher thought processes of the psychic level. The remaining two strata of the emotive map belongs to the realm of individual personhood because these emotions transcend (or at least exceed) the physical restrictions of lived-body and environment; they are the least subject to arbitrary alteration; and they are also by their very nature communicable and social in character. These are, first, the purely psychic feeling states or emotions having a characteristically ego-quality (e.g., euphoria, happiness, sympathy, enjoyment, sadness, sorrow, anger, jealousy‚Ä¶), and which manifest intentionally as empathy, preferring, loving, hating and willing.Formalism, p. 342 & 336. As representing one‚Äôs prevalent mental disposition it is important to note that psychic feeling states are alterable though acts of free will, thought and positive social interactions. Finally, Scheler identifies spiritual feelings which differ sharply from personal psychic feeling states in that ‚Äúall ego-states seem to be extinguished‚Ä¶ [and such emotions] take possession of the whole of our being.‚ÄùFormalism, p. 343. (e.g., bliss, awe, wonder, catharsis, despair, shame, remorse, anxiety, pangs of conscience, grief‚Ä¶). These types of emotions overtake and overcome us, usually quite unexpectedly. We can not reason or will to produce such spiritual feelings. As positive experiences, we can only open our hearts and mind and hope that they find us. The intentional arch of positive feelings and feeling states ultimately spans from the sensible to the spiritual, or from a sort of ‚Äúhedonistic nihilism‚Äù to deeper levels of personal contentment.Formalism, p. 331. Also, see Formalism, Part II, Chapter 9 (b) ‚ÄúAll Volitional Direction toward the Realization of Positive and Comparatively Higher Values Originally Arise from Positive Feeling-States and Sources.\\" Note, that all experience of positive feelings and felling states always inherently point and inform directionally toward yet higher values with their attendant feelings and feeling states. All positive feelings and feeling states precipitate awareness of yet higher value and feeling strata. Positive spiritual feelings particularly can serve a function of returning the person back onto their world with renewed perspective and energy. The opposite is true for negative feeling and feeling states.Max Scheler, Ressentiment, trans. William H. Holdheim (New York: Noonday, 1973), pp. 23-26. Also, see Formalism, Part II, and Chapter 9 (a) \\"The Law of the Tendency toward Surrogates When a ‚ÄúDeeper‚Äù Emotional Determination of the Ego Is Negative.\\" When personal progress becomes stagnant or frustrated in moving from a negative to a more positive plateau given a relatively high vital or psychic level of value attainment, there is an inherent tendency toward regression in terms of indulgence in traditional vices. This tendency might be termed as the transcendable (self- medicating) condition of mans \\"inherent moral weakness.\\" In its extreme form this tendency can lend itself toward ressentiment. In literature this tendency is akin to the concept of \\"tragic flaw\\".  The connection between emotive life and value modalities  The structure of Scheler's stratification model of emotive life correlates to the inherent spectral type structure of value rankings, or what Scheler termed the apriori hierarchy of value modalities.Formalism, Part I, Chapter 2, Section 5. Our earlier analogy to color perception illustrates this point. Just as all colors we intuit (see) are derivative of the pure spectrum or hues as when pure (\\"white\\") light is refracted through a prism, so too all intuited (felt) values are derivative of the apriori hierarchy of value modalities as when Divine love is apprehended through a purely ordered heart (Ordo Amoris). Scheler's claim is that these value modalities are constant and unchanging throughout history, forming a basis for objective non-formal ethics. From lowest to highest these modalities (with their respective positive and corresponding negative dis-value forms) are as follows: sensual values of the agreeable and the disagreeable; vital values of the noble and vulgar; mental (psychic) values of the beautiful and ugly, right and wrong and truth and falsehood; and finally values of the Holy and Unholy of the Divine and Idols.Formalism, Part I, Chapter 2-B (5) ‚ÄúA Priori Relations of Rank among Value-Modalities\\". Image:Values hiearchy.jpgClick on to Enlarge Image:Emotion value correlation.jpgClick on to Enlarge The logical implication of all the above is that human beings will naturally prefer a positive value (i.e., value situation) over a negative value (or dis-value), such as when life seems to tragically descend in a self- perpetuating spiral of negative emotions (envy, anger, jealousy, spite, hate, revenge)--a psycho-philosophical problematic termed Ressentiment. Furthermore, human beings will naturally prefer values of a higher ranking over those of a lower to the extent that they will invest time, work and sacrifice to order to attain them: for example, people will routinely defer a measure of immediate gratification in order to secure a child's education, their own retirement, etc. Hence, the relativity of value experience transitions to the beginnings of an objective morality which ensures personal fulfillment and transcendence. Since all ethics must ultimately advise our decisions in some way, Scheler‚Äôs non-formal value-based ethics promises to potentially achieve this end through our cognitive understanding and channeling of the advance information offered through our emotive life.  Philosophy vs. psychology: a relation of synergy  Critics and admirers alike find Scheler's ethics susceptible to flights of romanticism as \\"decisively canceling the normative character of ethical acts.\\" Rocco Buttiglione, Karol Wojtyla: The Thought of the Man who Became Pope John Paul II, trans. Paolo Guietti, Francesca Murphy (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1997). pp. 60-61 No surprise since a non-formal ethics does not rely on a system of rules or principles, but only implicit suggestions.Scheler maintained that two events insure the restoration of a rightly ordered heart Ordo Amoris: (a) the appearance of model persons (\\"role models\\"), and (b) natural mystic religious experience. More pragmatic applications of Scheler's principles might best be implemented under the controlled guidance of therapeutic psychology. Scheler‚Äôs ideas are inspiring to anyone who shares a common philosophical belief in the fundamental value of persons and in developing each of us to our optimum potential. This is all the more true when we consider just what this might mean for a well-ordered free and democratic society. However, extreme care should be taken not to assume Scheler‚Äôs philosophy is somehow based purely in some sort of progressive bottom-up psychology: for example, Abraham Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs, Jean Piaget‚Äôs theory of cognitive development, or Lawrence Kohlberg‚Äôs Stages of Moral Development. This is particularly important since Scheler‚Äôs relied extensively on hierarchical ‚Äústratification‚Äù models as a sort of general motifHierarchy of Model Person Types from lowest to highest: the Bon Vivant, the Hero, the Genius and the Saint. (See Formalism, p. 585). Hierarchy of Essential Forms of Human Togetherness from lowest to highest: the Herd, the Family & Live- Community, the Society, and the Collective Persons of Church and Nation. Hierarchy of Spheres of Consciousness (Forms of Cognition or Knowing) from lowest to highest: the Inanimate, the Animate, I-Thou and the Absolute. for his philosophy as a whole, as well as for a wide range of editorial topics. In spite many striking content similarities with scientific psychological theories, Scheler‚Äôs philosophy is, by contrast, first and foremost a serviceable speculative top-down emanation model,Formalism, p 94. guided by love and values, and based upon dualistic metaphysical principals Arthur R.

Also see ‚ÄúFrings‚Äù, Chapter 2 ‚ÄúOn the Bio-Psychic World.‚Äù For Scheler, Spirit is manifest infinitely as the Divine Essence, or God (depending upon your religious orientation); and finitely as persons and collectively as the nation and church. Persons are the juncture point and locus between drives (Vital Urge) and Spirit. of Vital Urge (Drang)\\"Frings\\", p 11. \\"...the lowest stratum of psychic being is the presence of an unspecified, undifferentiated, blind \\"urge forward\\" (Drang). It is completely conscious- less and, therefore without inner or outer sensation. This urge reveals itself as a slow \\"towards\\" and \\"away from\\" (e.g. towards light) and it must first be attributed to plant life. It is at the same time the \\"vapor\\" (Dampf), which is at the bottom of all life, driving forward all life up to its highest manifestations.\\" and Spirit (Geist).\\"Frings, pp 15-17. \\"...the essential difference between animal and man is the presence of Spirit (Geist), which makes human life highly independent of drives, and independent of attachment to environment (in contrast to the basically environment-stricken animal).... This is clear when we consider that man forms his own environment in social life and history as well as in using artificial means to change it for better adjustment and comfort.... Spirit elevates man above world and above himself (as organic being).... Spirit, then, cannot have its foundation or source in this objective world, but only in the primordial principal of the cosmos (Urgrund) itself.\\" Likewise, science alone can not fully account the sustaining spiritual forces that lift man and culture beyond the limitations of practical necessity, adaptation and natural selection. When scientific method can no longer design a model to verify what the scientist suspects, he becomes a philosopher of sorts...that is when the scientific community considers that member to have gone \\"soft in the head\\"‚Äîa distinction which ironically includes most of the best and brightest of science.

There were well over three thousand members, which included farmers in other parts of the state. The driving force in the association was its President Hiram Bond who with his brother Elmer Monroe Bond, a New York produce dealer, owned a plum nursery and bank in Santa Clara, California. There were wide swings in the price of prunes depending on time from the harvest. In 1901, the Association built a large dried fruit warehouse near Santa Clara's railroad station. The Cured Fruit Association disbanded in 1903. That year there was an unusually successful plum crop too large to be processed or stored in the association's warehouses. Farmers who were faced with rotting fruit sold outside of their agreement at less than the association approved price. A group of dissident members managed to obtain a majority and had the organization disbanded. In 1916, Rosenberg Brothers took over the warehouse for its dried prune and apricot operation. Many of the farmers involved were later active in the California Prune Board which in 2000 became the California Dried Plum Board. In 2019 a decision reverted the name of the organization.

It is found in human mitochrondria as TSFM. It is similar to eukaryotic EF-1B. EF-Ts serves as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for EF-Tu (elongation factor thermo unstable), catalyzing the release of guanosine diphosphate from EF-Tu. This enables EF-Tu to bind to a new guanosine triphosphate molecule, release EF-Ts, and go on to catalyze another aminoacyl tRNA addition.  Structure  EF-Ts and EF-Tu dimer forming the elongation factor complex full structureThe protein QŒ≤-Replicase is a tetrameric protein, meaning it contains four subunits. These subunits are the two elongation factors, EF-Tu & EF-Ts, the ribosomal protein subunit S1, and the RNA dependent RNA polymerase Œ≤-subunit. The two elongation factors form a heterodimer structure known as The Elongation factor complex, which is necessary for the polymerization activity of the RDRP Œ≤-Subunit. Its secondary structural components consists of Œ±-helices, Œ≤-sheets and Œ≤-barrels. EF-Ts comprises the majority of the top portion of the protein, while EF-Tu makes up the bottom half where the beta barrels are seen. The conformation is considered to be open, when no guanine nucleotide is bound to the active site in EF-Tu. The EF-Ts chain contains four important domains, the C-terminal domain, N-terminal domain, Dimerization domain, and the Core domain which all play a specific role in the protein's structure and functionality. The dimerization domain contains four anti-parallel Œ±-helices which is the main source of contact between EF-Tu and EF-Ts to form the dimer structure = Domains = Domains of EF-TsThe N-terminal domain spans from resides 1-54 (n1-n54), Core domain is from n55-n179, the Dimerization domain is from n180-n228, and lastly the C-terminal domain that is from n264-n282. the core domain contains two subdomains, C and N which interact with domains 3 and 1 of EF-Tu respectively.  Elongation process pathway  EF-Ts functions as guanine nucleotide exchange factor, it catalyzes the reaction of EF-Tu*GDP ( inactive form) to EF-Tu*GTP (active). EF-Tu (active) then delivers the aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome. Therefore, EF-Ts main role is recycling EF-Tu back to its active state in order to complete another elongation cycle. The majority of this pathway is performed through conformational changes of EF-Tu domain 1 which contains the active site and manipulation of the switch 1 & 2 regions by the ribosome and tRNA. First, in domain 1 of EF-Tu the GTPase activity site is blocked by a series of hydrophobic residues that block the catalytic residue His 84 in the inactive form prior to activation via EF-Ts. Once the tRNA is bound to EF-Tu, it is then delivered to the Ribosome which hydrolyses the GTP leaving EF-Tu with a lower affinity to bind the tRNA. The ribosome does this through manipulation of the switch 1 region, after GTP hydrolysis the secondary structure switches from primarily Œ±-helices to Œ≤-hairpin. EF-Tu is then released from the ribosome in the inactive state completing the cycle until activated once again by EF-Ts. Helix D of EF-Tu must interact with the N-terminal domain of EF-Ts for guanine nucleotide exchange. A recent study researched the reaction kinetics of the guanine nucleotide exchange by mutating certain residues on helix D of EF-Tu in order to see the primary residues involved in the pathway. Mutation of Leu148 and Glu 152 decreased the rate at which EF-Ts N-terminal domain binds to Helix D significantly, concluding these two residues play an important role in the reaction pathway.  Amino acid conservation between organisms  This article focuses on EF-Ts as it exists in QŒ≤-Bacteriophage, however many organisms use a similar elongation process with proteins that have nearly the same function as EF-Ts. EF-Ts belongs to the group of proteins known as guanine nucleotide exchange factors and these proteins function in many different biochemical pathways, it also belongs to the tsf superfamily. Majority of the amino acid conservation seen between other organisms is located in the N-terminal domain where EF-Ts bind to EF-Tu and the guanine nucleotide exchange occurs. below is the alignment of the important N-Terminal domain of EF-Ts as it exists in other organisms. * E.Coli: 8-LVKELRERTGAGMMDCKKALT-20 * LacBS: 8-LVAELRKRTEVSITKAREALS-20 * Bos Taurus:8-LLMKLRRKTGYSFINCKKALE-20 * Drosophila:8-ALAALRKKTGYTFANCKKALE-20 Conserved amino acids in all four are Leu12 and Arg18 (letters seen in bold above), it can be concluded that these two residues play an important role in the guanine nucleotide exchange since they are the only two completely conserved. In Eukaryotes EF-1 performs the same function, and the mechanism for guanine nucleotide exchange is nearly identical, as EF-Ts but is structurally dissimilar.

With the decline in trade came a post-Civil War rise in oyster harvesting, causing a renewed local economic boom lasting until the depletion of oyster beds in the Tred Avon and lower Choptank in the 1920s from overharvesting. Maryland governor Martin O'Malley sought to revive the river's oyster beds through citizen participation by initiating the \\"Marylanders Grow Oysters\\" project in September 2008, which encourages waterfront property owners to grow oysters from their piers using cages; after a 9- to 12-month growing period, the oysters are moved to a protected sanctuary in the Tred Avon.

Naval career  He was an officer on the ship Rotterdam, part of an expedition of 14 ships that sailed on 17 June 1602, from Texel under the command of Wybrand van Warwijck, to the East Indies. His destination was Bantam. Once there, the king of Bantam gave the Dutch permission to build a fort to serve as a factory. Wittert was appointed as its president.

On 18 August, presumably 1608, Wittert ravaged Mozambique. He arrived at Bantam in 1609, and went on to erect a lodge on Sulawesi. On 22 May 1609, Verhoeff was killed by the Bandanese, and Wittert succeeded him as admiral. On 22 June, the King of Ternate signed a favourable agreement with him. On 22 September, Wittert sailed to the Philippines, where he landed on the island Mortir, which he named Nassau, before he sailed for Manila to do battle with the Spanish there in order to remove the Moluccas from Spanish authority. He was able to capture 23 merchants vessels, winning a huge amount of plunder, but he was ambushed in Manila by a superior force on 23 April 1610, and killed.

Super-Pharm was founded by Murray Koffler with his two oldest children, Leon and Theo. The pharmacy uses a similar logo, and has private-label brands (such as Life), as Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada. History in 1921, Leon Koffler began the story of Koffler Drug Stores. In 1941, his son Murray Koffler inherited the two drug stores, called \\"Koffler's Drugs\\"; by 1962, Koffler's had grown to a chain of 17 pharmacies, which Murray then renamed \\"Shoppers Drug Mart\\" in the 1970s. During the 1970s, Koffler visited Israel; following this visit, he decided to set up a chain similar to his one in Canada. Co- founded with his son Leon and daughter Theo. The first Super-Pharm pharmacy was opened in the Neve Amirim neighbourhood of Herzliya, Israel in 1979. Theo Koffler, co-founder and VP, focused on the cosmetic marketing and strategic operational planning. The drug store was different from pharmacies in the past in that it was open on the Jewish Sabbath (Saturday), and sold products that were not drugs. Two years later, they opened a second pharmacy in Jerusalem; 1985 saw the opening of a Super-Pharm branch in the Ayalon shopping mall, which was their first location in a shopping mall. In July 2007, Bank Leumi acquired 18% stake in for 190 million shekels. This gave Super-Pharm a company value of NIS 1.05 billion shekels. On 4 January 2011, the trade publication Chain Drug Review recognized Super-Pharm as the Global Chain Drug Retailer of the Year for 2010. In April 2019, Union Group headed by the Horesh family bought approximately 34% of Super-Pharm from the present investors Leumi Investments, Discount Investments and Leon Koffler.

He then pursued graduate studies in philosophy at Harvard University, the University of Munich, and Princeton University, where he received his Ph.D. in 1966 with a dissertation titled \\"Hegel‚Äôs Search For Absolute Knowledge\\". Princeton University Library - Dissertations Soll taught the majority of his academic career at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He came to UW-Madison as an instructor in philosophy in 1964, and taught there until his retirement in May 2011. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1966, promoted again to associate professor with tenure in 1969, and to full professor in 1973. He has also held visiting professorships at Justus-Liebig University (Germany), the University of Auckland, and the Bosphorus University, Istanbul. His philosophical interests include continental philosophy - especially German philosophy, Friedrich Nietzsche, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, and existentialism generally. He also focused on the intersections of philosophy and literature, the history of philosophy, aesthetics, philosophical psychology, and philosophy of life. He has published widely in aesthetics, and complements his academic knowledge with expert proficiency in the manufacture of fine art books. Ivan has exhibited his hand-crafted art books in many galleries around the world, and he has integrated the experience in doing so with his academic work. In the area of German philosophy, he has written the influential Introduction to Hegel's Metaphysics, has authored more than 50 scholarly articles, and has given nearly 130 talks at various national and international venues. Soll has been the recipient of NEH, ACLS, and UW-Madison IRH fellowships, as well as a Bellagio fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation and a German D.A.A.D award. He has frequently been the lead professor at UW-Madison study abroad programs: in London (twice), Florence (five times) and Budapest (twice). University of Wisconsin Philosophy Department 2011 newsletter Ideas, Activities and Contributions Soll established his reputation among Nietzsche scholars with his 1973 essay \\"Reflections on Recurrence: A Re-Examination of Nietzsche's Doctrine\\" which puts forth a novel interpretation of Nietzsche's idea of the eternal recurrence. Soll's interpretation states that the literal possibility of the eternal recurrence is not as important as taking on the idea for what its consequences imply. He argues that the implications of this idea force the individual to evaluate past, current, and future life choices. Documented in the book Genius In Their Own Words: The Intellectual Journeys of Seven Great 20th-Century Thinkers edited by David Ramsay Steele (foreword by Arthur Danto) a mediated series of questions posed by Soll were presented to the famed French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre on various aspects of Sartre's philosophy with Sartre providing his answers to Soll's questions. Soll contributed three introductions to Walter Kaufmann's Discovering the Mind series of books which were some of the last published works from Kaufmann. Soll has also authored several encyclopedia entries on different topics of philosophy. He continues to be discussed by younger Nietzsche scholars like Bernard Reginster who engaged with his ideas in the 2006 book The Affirmation of Life: Nietzsche on Overcoming Nihilism. Soll's courses on Nietzsche and Existentialism at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison continue to be popular courses in the Wisconsin Philosophy Department. He regularly teaches Introduction to Philosophy thereby introducing the discipline to many new students. Soll and his wife, Marta Gomez, have produced original artists' books collaboratively at their Tiramisu Press in Madison, Wisconsin. Soll was a participant in the Peter Sloterdijk lecture series seminar and conference workshop, May 19 to 23, 2008 at the University of Warwick where he discussed the relationship between the philosophies of Sloterdijk and Nietzsche.Programme for Slotterdijk at Warwick conference Soll completed an essay on Charles Darwin's influence on German philosophy for a volume on Darwin to be published in Turkey, and an essay on Nietzsche's anti-moralism for a conference in Britain in 2010. For the 2010 Summer he taught in Istanbul. In 2010 he gave the lead-off lecture at a conference in England on Nietzsche's Postmoralism and the keynote address in German, titled Lob der Illusion (In Praise of Illusion), at a conference in Germany.

Created as part of a $3 million education campaign by the National Advisory Committee on AIDS (NACAIDS), the advertisement depicted the Grim Reaper bowling in a bowling alley and knocking over men, women, and child \\"pins\\" which represented AIDS victims. The commercial first screened on 5 April 1987 and was highly controversial, one reason being that the Grim Reaper became identified with gay men. Nevertheless, the commercial was regarded as highly successful in educating the Australian public about the issue. The commercial was created by Siimon Reynolds and spoken by voice-over artist John Stanton. Background Simon Reynolds on the idea of the commercial: > ...bowling was in my head. I was bowling every week. And I used to love the > animation at Christmas with... for Scrooge, where the Grim Reaper came and > visited Scrooge. And I thought, \\"Well, maybe the Grim Reaper could machine- > gun them.\\" Then I thought, no, that'll be a five-second ad and it'll be too > short. What's another way he could kill them? He could bowl balls at them. > And those two things came together. Of course, back then, the data was > unclear. In some countries‚Äîfor instance, Italy‚Äîalmost as many women who had > AIDS as men. I think there was also a bit of a political fear that there'll > be a backlash against gays if everybody thinks it's some kind of gay plague. > But, you know, other countries had failed in their AIDS education because > heterosexuals weren't listening. We really had to wake people up. There was > a lot of information about how to stop AIDS out there, but no-one was > reading it. Controversy The commercial became controversial for offending some members of the gay community. Australian AIDS pioneer Ron Penny regretted the fact this occurred: > The downside was that the Grim Reaper became identified with gay men rather > than as the Reaper. That was what we had unintentionally produced‚Äî[the > belief] by some that the Reaper was people with HIV infection, rather than > the Reaper harvesting the dead. I think there's never been anything on > television or any media that has ever matched it in terms of impact, but no > advertising can be without some downside, and that was never intended. But > it at least made people aware and probably did change sexual practices of > heterosexuals.

SS Walter Adams was a wooden-hulled steam fishing trawler built in 1890 by Robert Palmer and Son, of Noank, Connecticut, and rebuilt in 1898. The U.S. Navy inspected her for possible naval service in March 1917 and again in June 1918, and chartered her on 23 June 1918 for World War I service in the 6th Naval District. She was commissioned on 1 October 1918 as USS Walter Adams with Lieutenant, junior grade, Hugh G. Taylor in command.

Biography Though Josephus does not seem to know it, Zenodorus was actually the son of Lysanias, for a funerary inscription found at Heliopolis (Baalbek) was dedicated to \\"Zenodorus the son of Lysanias the tetrarch\\" (of Iturea).Henri Seyrig, \\"Antiquit√©s syriennes\\", Syria, T. 31, Fasc. 1/2 (1954), p.92 fn.4. = \\"C'est ce qui ressort de l'inscription fun√©raire de Baalbek, d√©di√©e a Zenodore fils de Lysanias le t√©trarque (d'Abil√®ne)...\\". He gained control, on lease we are told, of some of his father's territory (confiscated when his father had been executed by Mark Antony), but it is not clear exactly what his territory was for Josephus only gives us information concerning areas south of Damascus (Ulatha and Paneas, both, we are told, west of Trachonitis), while the center of Lysanias's realm was north-west of Damascus. He may in fact have held the lease on his territories as far back as the time of his father's execution (36 BCE), doing the work of administering the region while initially paying rent to Cleopatra, though we only have Josephus's indications to follow.This is Emil Schuerer's conjecture, A History of the Jewish People in the Time of Jesus Christ, Vol.1, Appendix 1. Coins minted during his reign describe Zenodorus as \\"tetrarch and high priest\\", a phrase also used on coins by his forebearers. This indicates that for most of his possession of his father's lands, he was more than a lessee of the property. Josephus reports Zenodorus was not satisfied with his earnings so he became involved in acts of robbery in the Trachonitis region south-east of Damascus as well as against Damascus itself. The Damascenes turned to the Roman governor to relieve their sufferings, which led Augustus to give control of the Trachonitis to Herod the Great, along with the task of bringing order to the area. Zenodorus went to Rome in an attempt to bring charges against Herod for the zealousness of his efforts in the Trachonitis, but returned, not having achieved anything. Starting to despair for his situation Zenodorus sold a part of his lands called Auranitis for fifty talents, though this land had been confiscated by Augustus and given to Herod! Next he instigated the inhabitants of Gadara to make charges against Herod before Augustus who had come to Syria, but Augustus stood by Herod and the unrest dissipated. Zenodorus's problems were finally resolved when he suffered a ruptured intestine and died soon afterwards in Antioch. Josephus's presentation of Zenodorus is rather negative and the interpretations he places on the events he describes may simply represent the propaganda of his major source for the period, Nicolaus of Damascus, an important functionary in the court of Herod the Great, who would have looked after Herod's best interests to the loss of Zenodorus.

The bridge is one of four remaining covered bridges in Missouri, which once numbered about 30. It is a relatively rare example of a Howe truss bridge, one of three in Missouri. The covered bridge is named for Sandy Creek, which it crosses, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. History Jefferson County embarked on a building program following the American Civil War and paid John H. Morse $2000 for the construction of Sandy Creek Covered Bridge in 1872. Six bridges were built that year along the Old Lemay Ferry Road to connect the county seat of Hillsboro to St. Louis County. It was destroyed by high water in 1886, and was rebuilt for $899 by Henry Steffin using half of the original timbers and the original abutments. The bridge is long and wide and has a height of . The bridge came under the protection of the state parks system when the state legislature passed an act in 1967 declaring all remaining covered bridges in the state to be state historic sites. Jefferson County released the bridge to the state in 1968; a major restoration project returned the bridge to its original appearance in 1984. Activities and amenities The bridge is open to pedestrian traffic. The historic site offers picnic tables, toilet facilities, and an interpretive display.

Viruses, parasites and bacteria are covered in protein and sugar molecules that help them gain entry into a host by counteracting the host's defenses. One such molecule is the M protein produced by certain streptococcal bacteria. At its C-terminus within the cell wall, M proteins embody a motif that is now known to be shared by many Gram-positive bacterial surface proteins. The motif includes a conserved pentapeptide LPXTG, which precedes a hydrophobic C-terminal membrane spanning domain, which itself precedes a cluster of basic residues at the C-terminus. M protein is strongly anti-phagocytic and is the major virulence factor for group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes). It binds to serum factor H, destroying C3-convertase and preventing opsonization by C3b. However plasma B cells can generate antibodies against M protein which will help in opsonization and further the destruction of the microorganism by the macrophages and neutrophils. Cross- reactivity of anti-M protein antibodies with heart muscle has been suggested to be associated in some way with rheumatic fever. It was originally identified by Rebecca Lancefield, who also formulated the Lancefield classification system for streptococcal bacteria. Bacteria like S. pyogenes, which possess M protein are classified in group A of the Lancefield system.

Its corporate body is the Church of Universal Eclectic Wicca (CUEW) which is incorporated and based in Great Falls, Virginia. It is particularly noted for its early Internet teaching coven ‚Äì the Coven of the Far Flung Net (CFFN), and for its inclusive approach to solitary as well as coven based practitioners. History =Silver Chalice Wicca= What was to become UEW began, in 1969, as the core coven associated with the Silver Chalice Land Trust; an intentional community based in Westchester, New York. Silver Chalice had a diverse membership drawing from both Dianic and British Traditional Wiccan backgrounds. It was partly as a response to this diversity, as well as a perceived need for reform in Wicca, that their High Priestess, Jayne Tomas, began to create a body of liturgy for Silver Chalice Wicca as a distinct tradition. A defining text is the Ordains of Silver Chalice, which may be seen as an attempt to refer to, and move away from, the Old Laws of Gardnerian Wicca. Together with the Fifteen Creeds of Silver Chalice Wicca (1969) they emphasized modernism; democratic principles; historical, intellectual and personal integrity; race and gender equality; self-determination; and engagement with society. =Change of name= By 1986 the land held by the Silver Chalice Land Trust was sold, and all the covens that originated with Silver Chalice were referred to as Universal Eclectic Wicca. 'Universal' because \\"Wicca is universal because it can be used by all, and anything can be used in Wicca\\"; and 'Eclectic' because \\"UEW is based not on one or two sources, but an infinite number of sources\\". =On-line teaching covens= In 1997 UEW chartered the Coven of the Far Flung Net (CFFN), which began operating in January of the following year; and which it maintains was the first on-line teaching coven. UEW has two other on-line teaching groups, the Coven of Non-Fluffy Wicca (2006), which is aimed at more advanced students with some prior knowledge of Wicca, and Vircle, for Third Circle Studies. =Schisms= In 2004, following a reorganization of CFFN which abolished its then clan structure, one of the dissolved clans, Athames's Edge, re- established itself to form an independent Progressive Eclectic Wicca tradition. Later, in 2008, the first Australian UEW coven, Oak and Mistletoe, split away to establish the Inclusive Wicca tradition. Core beliefs UEW allows for diverse interpretations of Wiccan practice and belief; provided that a core set of ethical values are observed. These are commonly referred to as the Five Points of Wiccan Belief and the Affirmation of Acknowledgement. =Five Points= The Five Points of Wiccan belief are the Wiccan Rede, the Law of Return, the Ethic of Self-Responsibility, the Ethic of Constant Improvement and the Ethic of Attunement. =Affirmation of Acknowledgement= In addition to the 'Five Points', UEW requires its members to assent to the Affirmation of Acknowledgement, which is intended to inform behavior towards, and interaction with, those of other faiths. It states that: Organization =Types of membership= There are five types of membership recognized in UEW: =Triad= The executive body of CUEW is the three-person Triad. The Triad is solely responsible for extending or withholding membership of CUEW to both individuals and groups. Each member of the Triad is responsible for the selection and training of their successor. =Council of Elders= The Triad is advised and assisted by a Council of Elders. Any Third Circle member may nominate themselves for membership of the Council of Elders. The Council of Elders annually elects one of their number as Chief Elder. =Association of Universal Eclectic Wicca Clergy= The Association of Universal Eclectic Wicca Clergy (AUEWC), is responsible for the ratification of Ordained Clergy.

Following embryonic development the fetal stage of development takes place. In human prenatal development, fetal development begins from the ninth week after fertilisation (or eleventh week gestational age) and continues until birth. Prenatal development is a continuum, with no clear defining feature distinguishing an embryo from a fetus. However, a fetus is characterized by the presence of all the major body organs, though they will not yet be fully developed and functional and some not yet situated in their final anatomical location.  Etymology  The word fetus (plural fetuses or feti) is related to the Latin fƒìtus (\\"offspring\\", \\"bringing forth\\", \\"hatching of young\\")O.E.D.2nd Ed.2005Harper, Douglas. (2001).

The predominant British, Irish, and Commonwealth spelling is foetus, which has been in use since at least 1594. The spelling with -oe- arose in Late Latin, in which the distinction between the vowel sounds -oe- and -e- had been lost. This spelling is the most common in most Commonwealth nations, except in the medical literature, where fetus is used. The more classical spelling fetus is used in Canada and the United States. In addition, fetus is now the standard English spelling throughout the world in medical journals.New Oxford Dictionary of English. The spelling faetus was also used historically.American Dictionary of the English Language, Noah Webster, 1828.  Development  =Weeks 9 to 16 (2 to 3.6 months)= A human fetus, attached to placenta, at three months gestational age. In humans, the fetal stage starts nine weeks after fertilization.Klossner, N.

The head makes up nearly half of the size of the fetus. Breathing-like movements of the fetus are necessary for the stimulation of lung development, rather than for obtaining oxygen.Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, Preterm Birth: Causes, Consequences, and Prevention (2006), page 317.

The voluntary control of movement develops and matures during a prolonged period up to puberty....\\"Becher, Julie-Claire. , Behind the Medical Headlines (Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow October 2004) =Variation in growth= There is much variation in the growth of the human fetus. When fetal size is less than expected, the condition is known as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) also called fetal growth restriction (FGR); factors affecting fetal growth can be maternal, placental, or fetal.Holden, Chris and MacDonald, Anita. Nutrition and Child Health (Elsevier 2000). Retrieved 2007-03-04. Maternal factors include maternal weight, body mass index, nutritional state, emotional stress, toxin exposure (including tobacco, alcohol, heroin, and other drugs which can also harm the fetus in other ways), and uterine blood flow. Placental factors include size, microstructure (densities and architecture), umbilical blood flow, transporters and binding proteins, nutrient utilization and nutrient production. Fetal factors include the fetus genome, nutrient production, and hormone output. Also, female fetuses tend to weigh less than males, at full term. Fetal growth is often classified as follows: small for gestational age (SGA), appropriate for gestational age (AGA), and large for gestational age (LGA).Queenan, John. Management of High- Risk Pregnancy (Blackwell 1999). Retrieved 2007-03-04. SGA can result in low birth weight, although premature birth can also result in low birth weight. Low birth weight increases risk for perinatal mortality (death shortly after birth), asphyxia, hypothermia, polycythemia, hypocalcemia, immune dysfunction, neurologic abnormalities, and other long-term health problems. SGA may be associated with growth delay, or it may instead be associated with absolute stunting of growth.  Viability  Fetal viability refers to a point in fetal development at which the fetus may survive outside the womb. The lower limit of viability is approximately 5-3/4 months gestational age and is usually later.Halamek, Louis. \\"Prenatal Consultation at the Limits of Viability \\", NeoReviews, Vol.4 No.6 (2003): \\"most neonatologists would agree that survival of infants younger than approximately 22 to 23 weeks‚Äô estimated gestational age [i.e. 20 to 21 weeks' estimated fertilization age] is universally dismal and that resuscitative efforts should not be undertaken when a neonate is born at this point in pregnancy.\\" There is no sharp limit of development, age, or weight at which a fetus automatically becomes viable.Moore, Keith and Persaud, T. The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology, p. 103 (Saunders 2003). According to data from 2003‚Äì05, survival rates are 20‚Äì35% for babies born at 23 weeks of gestation (5-3/4 months); 50‚Äì70% at 24-25 weeks (6 - 6-1/4 months); and >90% at 26-27 weeks (6-1/2 - 6-3/4 months) and over.March of Dimes - Neonatal Death , retrieved September 2, 2009. It is rare for a baby weighing less than to survive. When such premature babies are born, the main causes of mortality are that the respiratory system and the central nervous system are not completely differentiated. If given expert postnatal care, some preterm babies weighing less than may survive, and are referred to as extremely low birth weight or immature infants. Preterm birth is the most common cause of infant mortality, causing almost 30 percent of neonatal deaths. At an occurrence rate of 5% to 18% of all deliveries, it is also more common than postmature birth, which occurs in 3% to 12% of pregnancies.  Circulatory system  =Before birth= Diagram of the human fetal circulatory system. The heart and blood vessels of the circulatory system, form relatively early during embryonic development, but continue to grow and develop in complexity in the growing fetus. A functional circulatory system is a biological necessity, since mammalian tissues can not grow more than a few cell layers thick without an active blood supply. The prenatal circulation of blood is different from postnatal circulation, mainly because the lungs are not in use. The fetus obtains oxygen and nutrients from the mother through the placenta and the umbilical cord.Whitaker, Kent. Comprehensive Perinatal and Pediatric Respiratory Care (Delmar 2001). Retrieved 2007-03-04. Blood from the placenta is carried to the fetus by the umbilical vein. About half of this enters the fetal ductus venosus and is carried to the inferior vena cava, while the other half enters the liver proper from the inferior border of the liver. The branch of the umbilical vein that supplies the right lobe of the liver first joins with the portal vein. The blood then moves to the right atrium of the heart. In the fetus, there is an opening between the right and left atrium (the foramen ovale), and most of the blood flows from the right into the left atrium, thus bypassing pulmonary circulation. The majority of blood flow is into the left ventricle from where it is pumped through the aorta into the body. Some of the blood moves from the aorta through the internal iliac arteries to the umbilical arteries, and re-enters the placenta, where carbon dioxide and other waste products from the fetus are taken up and enter the woman's circulation. Some of the blood from the right atrium does not enter the left atrium, but enters the right ventricle and is pumped into the pulmonary artery. In the fetus, there is a special connection between the pulmonary artery and the aorta, called the ductus arteriosus, which directs most of this blood away from the lungs (which aren't being used for respiration at this point as the fetus is suspended in amniotic fluid). File:Ultrasound_image_of_a_fetus.jpg3D ultrasound of fetus (about 3-1/2 months gestational age) File:Sucking his thumb and waving.jpgFetus at 4-1/4 months File:3dultrasound 20 weeks.jpgFetus at 5 months =Postnatal development= With the first breath after birth, the system changes suddenly. Pulmonary resistance is reduced dramatically, prompting more blood to move into the pulmonary arteries from the right atrium and ventricle of the heart and less to flow through the foramen ovale into the left atrium. The blood from the lungs travels through the pulmonary veins to the left atrium, producing an increase in pressure that pushes the septum primum against the septum secundum, closing the foramen ovale and completing the separation of the newborn's circulatory system into the standard left and right sides. Thereafter, the foramen ovale is known as the fossa ovalis. The ductus arteriosus normally closes within one or two days of birth, leaving the ligamentum arteriosum, while the umbilical vein and ductus venosus usually closes within two to five days after birth, leaving, respectively, the liver's ligamentum teres and ligamentum venosus.  Immune system  The placenta functions as a maternal-fetal barrier against the transmission of microbes. When this is insufficient, mother-to-child transmission of infectious diseases can occur. Maternal IgG antibodies cross the placenta, giving the fetus passive immunity against those diseases for which the mother has antibodies. This transfer of antibodies in humans begins as early as the fifth month (gestational age) and certainly by the sixth month.Page 202 of  Developmental problems  A developing fetus is highly susceptible to anomalies in its growth and metabolism, increasing the risk of birth defects. One area of concern is the lifestyle choices made during pregnancy. Diet is especially important in the early stages of development. Studies show that supplementation of the person's diet with folic acid reduces the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube defects. Another dietary concern is whether breakfast is eaten. Skipping breakfast could lead to extended periods of lower than normal nutrients in the maternal blood, leading to a higher risk of prematurity, or birth defects. Alcohol consumption may increase the risk of the development of fetal alcohol syndrome, a condition leading to intellectual disability in some infants. Smoking during pregnancy may also lead to miscarriages and low birth weight (2500 grams, 5.5 lb). Low birth weight is a concern for medical providers due to the tendency of these infants, described as \\"premature by weight\\", to have a higher risk of secondary medical problems. X-rays are known to have possible adverse effects on the development of the fetus, and the risks need to be weighed against the benefits.O‚ÄôReilly, Deirdre. \\"Fetal development \\". MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia (2007-10-19). Retrieved 2018-08-26. Congenital disorders are acquired before birth. Infants with certain congenital heart defects can survive only as long as the ductus remains open: in such cases the closure of the ductus can be delayed by the administration of prostaglandins to permit sufficient time for the surgical correction of the anomalies. Conversely, in cases of patent ductus arteriosus, where the ductus does not properly close, drugs that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis can be used to encourage its closure, so that surgery can be avoided. Other heart birth defects include ventricular septal defect, pulmonary atresia, and tetralogy of Fallot. An abdominal pregnancy can result in the death of the fetus and where this is rarely not resolved it can lead to its formation into a lithopedion.  Fetal pain  Fetal pain, its existence and its implications are debated politically and academically. According to the conclusions of a review published in 2005, \\"Evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester.\\" Two authors of the study published in JAMA did not report their abortion-related activities, which pro-life groups called a conflict of interest; the editor of JAMA responded that JAMA probably would have mentioned those activities if they had been disclosed, but still would have published the study. See Denise Grady, ‚ÄúStudy Authors Didn't Report Abortion Ties‚Äù , New York Times (2005-08-26).\\"Study: Fetus feels no pain until third trimester\\" NBC News However, developmental neurobiologists argue that the establishment of thalamocortical connections (at about 6-1/2 months) is an essential event with regard to fetal perception of pain.Johnson, Martin and Everitt, Barry. Essential reproduction (Blackwell 2000): \\"The multidimensionality of pain perception, involving sensory, emotional, and cognitive factors may in itself be the basis of conscious, painful experience, but it will remain difficult to attribute this to a fetus at any particular developmental age.\\" Retrieved 2007-02-21. Nevertheless, the perception of pain involves sensory, emotional and cognitive factors and it is \\"impossible to know\\" when pain is experienced, even if it is known when thalamocortical connections are established.

Other animals Fourteen phases of elephant development before birth A fetus is a stage in the prenatal development of viviparous organisms. This stage lies between embryogenesis and birth . Many vertebrates have fetal stages, ranging from most mammals to many fish. In addition, some invertebrates bear live young, including some species of onychophora and many arthropods. The fetuses of most mammals are situated similarly to the human fetus within their mothers.ZFIN, Pharyngula Period (24-48 h) . Modified from: Kimmel et al., 1995. Developmental Dynamics 203:253-310. Downloaded 5 March 2007. However, the anatomy of the area surrounding a fetus is different in litter-bearing animals compared to humans: each fetus of a litter-bearing animal is surrounded by placental tissue and is lodged along one of two long uteri instead of the single uterus found in a human female. Development at birth varies considerably among animals, and even among mammals. Altricial species are relatively helpless at birth and require considerable parental care and protection. In contrast, precocial animals are born with open eyes, have hair or down, have large brains, and are immediately mobile and somewhat able to flee from, or defend themselves against, predators. Primates are precocial at birth, with the exception of humans.Lewin, Roger. Human Evolution, page 78 (Blackwell 2004). The duration of gestation in placental mammals varies from 18 days in jumping mice to 23 months in elephants.Sumich, James and Dudley, Gordon. Laboratory and Field Investigations in Marine Life, page 320 (Jones & Bartlett 2008). Generally speaking, fetuses of larger land mammals require longer gestation periods. Fetal stage of a porpoise The benefits of a fetal stage means that young are more developed when they are born. Therefore, they may need less parental care and may be better able to fend for themselves. However, carrying fetuses exerts costs on the mother, who must take on extra food to fuel the growth of her offspring, and whose mobility and comfort may be affected (especially toward the end of the fetal stage). In some instances, the presence of a fetal stage may allow organisms to time the birth of their offspring to a favorable season.

DV, as it is commonly called, is part of the Ysleta Independent School District, serving about 2,000 students in grades 9 to 12. Its feeder school is Del Valle Middle School. Antonio Acuna took over as Principal at Del Valle High School at the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year. As of 2011, Del Valle is considered a \\"recognized school\\" by the TEA association. In 2013 The Texas UIL changed the areas schools 4A to 5A and 5A to 6A division, as of 2014 Del Valle High School is in the UIL 5A. Del Valle has had much success in their athletic programs, most of their success coming from their boys soccer program. As of 2008, they have won two Texas State Championships, although soccer has been successful in recent years, other sports such as baseball & softball are in the playoffs year after year. Football is another program that also goes to the playoffs every season under Coach Jesse Perales and is a powerhouse in the 2-4A (Now 2-5A) district. Coach Valerie Salazar-Hairston was honored by The El Paso Times as the Girls All City Track and Field Coach of the Year [9/2010]. Coach Salazar-Hairston led the Conquistadores to their first District Championship and swept the District with all three teams (Freshman, JV and Varsity). Del Valle also has an award- winning marching band that has made it to the UIL Texas State Marching Contest 3 times: 2003, 2005, and most recently 2009. The band is also considered one of El Paso's strong powerhouse. The program has been successful in the NMSU Tournament of Bands, in Las Cruces, NM. The program has also attended the BOA Regionals and Super Regionals in El Paso and San Antonio, Texas. https://web.archive.org/web/20100121032330/http://delvalleband.org/ The school opened in August 1987 and in 2017 celebrated thirty years. Located very close to the Mexican border, the population of Del Valle is mostly Hispanic. DV graduated its first class in June 1990. During 2006-2008, Del Valle High School had new additions built on to it: New Roofing, new Tennis Courts, a new Track around the football field, a three-story state of the art science wing, a band and musical arts wing and a modern field house to accommodate the growing, successful athletics programs and a Jumbotron added in 2018. DVHS also offers Multinational/Multimedia Business Magnet School within its campus. This program offers informative information for students that want to pursue a career with business and marketing.

Clostridial species are one of the major causes of food poisoning/gastrointestinal illnesses. They are anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming rods that occur naturally in the soil. Among the family are: Clostridium botulinum, which produces one of the most potent toxins in existence; Clostridium tetani, causative agent of tetanus; and Clostridium perfringens, commonly found in wound infections and diarrhea cases. The use of toxins to damage the host is a method deployed by many bacterial pathogens. The major virulence factor of C. perfringens is the CPE enterotoxin, which is secreted upon invasion of the host gut, and contributes to food poisoning and other gastrointestinal illnesses. It has a molecular weight of 35.3kDa, and is responsible for the disintegration of tight junctions between epithelial cells in the gut. This mechanism is mediated by host claudin-3 and claudin-4 receptors, situated at the tight junctions. Clostridium enterotoxin is a nine- stranded beta sheet sandwich in shape. It has been determined that it is very similar to other spore-forming bacteria. The PFAM ID is a clenterotox. The binding site is between beta sheets eight and nine. This allows the human claudin-3,4,6,7,8 and 14 to bind but not 1,2,5, and 10. The way the protein work is it destroys the cell membrane structure of animals by binding to claudin family proteins. These are components of tight junctions of the epithelial cell membrane.

History Euler made the first conjectures about biquadratic reciprocity.Euler, Tractatus, ¬ß 456 Gauss published two monographs on biquadratic reciprocity. In the first one (1828) he proved Euler's conjecture about the biquadratic character of 2. In the second one (1832) he stated the biquadratic reciprocity law for the Gaussian integers and proved the supplementary formulas. He saidGauss, BQ, ¬ß 67 that a third monograph would be forthcoming with the proof of the general theorem, but it never appeared. Jacobi presented proofs in his K√∂nigsberg lectures of 1836‚Äì37.Lemmermeyer, p. 200 The first published proofs were by Eisenstein.Eisenstein, Lois de reciprociteEisenstein, Einfacher Beweis ...Eisenstein, Application de l'algebre ...Eisenstein, Beitrage zur Theorie der elliptischen ... Since then a number of other proofs of the classical (Gaussian) version have been found,Lemmermeyer, pp. 199‚Äì202 as well as alternate statements. Lemmermeyer states that there has been an explosion of interest in the rational reciprocity laws since the 1970s.Lemmermeyer, p. 172 Integers A quartic or biquadratic residue (mod p) is any number congruent to the fourth power of an integer (mod p). If x4 ‚â° a (mod p) does not have an integer solution, a is a quartic or biquadratic nonresidue (mod p).Gauss, BQ ¬ß 2 As is often the case in number theory, it is easiest to work modulo prime numbers, so in this section all moduli p, q, etc., are assumed to positive, odd primes. =Gauss= The first thing to notice when working within the ring Z of integers is that if the prime number q is ‚â° 3 (mod 4) then a residue r is a quadratic residue (mod q) if and only if it is a biquadratic residue (mod q). Indeed, the first supplement of quadratic reciprocity states that ‚àí1 is a quadratic nonresidue (mod q), so that for any integer x, one of x and ‚àíx is a quadratic residue and the other one is a nonresidue. Thus, if r ‚â° a2 (mod q) is a quadratic residue, then if a ‚â° b2 is a residue, r ‚â° a2 ‚â° b4 (mod q) is a biquadratic residue, and if a is a nonresidue, ‚àía is a residue, ‚àía ‚â° b2, and again, r ‚â° (‚àía)2 ‚â° b4 (mod q) is a biquadratic residue.Gauss, BQ ¬ß 3 Therefore, the only interesting case is when the modulus p ‚â° 1 (mod 4). Gauss provedGauss, BQ ¬ß¬ß 4‚Äì7 that if p ‚â° 1 (mod 4) then the nonzero residue classes (mod p) can be divided into four sets, each containing (p‚àí1)/4 numbers. Let e be a quadratic nonresidue. The first set is the quartic residues; the second one is e times the numbers in the first set, the third is e2 times the numbers in the first set, and the fourth one is e3 times the numbers in the first set. Another way to describe this division is to let g be a primitive root (mod p); then the first set is all the numbers whose indices with respect to this root are ‚â° 0 (mod 4), the second set is all those whose indices are ‚â° 1 (mod 4), etc.Gauss, BQ ¬ß 8 In the vocabulary of group theory, the first set is a subgroup of index 4 (of the multiplicative group Z/pZ√ó), and the other three are its cosets. The first set is the biquadratic residues, the third set is the quadratic residues that are not quartic residues, and the second and fourth sets are the quadratic nonresidues. Gauss proved that ‚àí1 is a biquadratic residue if p ‚â° 1 (mod 8) and a quadratic, but not biquadratic, residue, when p ‚â° 5 (mod 8).Gauss, BQ ¬ß 10 2 is a quadratic residue mod p if and only if p ‚â° ¬±1 (mod 8). Since p is also ‚â° 1 (mod 4), this means p ‚â° 1 (mod 8). Every such prime is the sum of a square and twice a square.Gauss, DA Art. 182 Gauss proved Let q = a2 \\\\+ 2b2 ‚â° 1 (mod 8) be a prime number. Then :2 is a biquadratic residue (mod q) if and only if a ‚â° ¬±1 (mod 8), and :2 is a quadratic, but not a biquadratic, residue (mod q) if and only if a ‚â° ¬±3 (mod 8). Every prime p ‚â° 1 (mod 4) is the sum of two squares.Gauss, DA, Art. 182 If p = a2 \\\\+ b2 where a is odd and b is even, Gauss provedGauss BQ ¬ß¬ß 14‚Äì21 that 2 belongs to the first (respectively second, third, or fourth) class defined above if and only if b ‚â° 0 (resp. 2, 4, or 6) (mod 8). The first case of this is one of Euler's conjectures: :2 is a biquadratic residue of a prime p ‚â° 1 (mod 4) if and only if p = a2 \\\\+ 64b2. =Dirichlet= For an odd prime number p and a quadratic residue a (mod p), Euler's criterion states that a^{\\\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{p}, so if p ‚â° 1 (mod 4), a^{\\\\frac{p-1}{4}}\\\\equiv\\\\pm 1 \\\\pmod{p}. Define the rational quartic residue symbol for prime p ‚â° 1 (mod 4) and quadratic residue a (mod p) as \\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{a}{p}\\\\Bigg)_4= \\\\pm 1 \\\\equiv a^{\\\\frac{p-1}{4}} \\\\pmod{p}. It is easy to prove that a is a biquadratic residue (mod p) if and only if \\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{a}{p}\\\\Bigg)_4= 1. DirichletDirichlet, Demonstration ... simplified Gauss's proof of the biquadratic character of 2 (his proof only requires quadratic reciprocity for the integers) and put the result in the following form: Let p = a2 \\\\+ b2 ‚â° 1 (mod 4) be prime, and let i ‚â° b/a (mod p). Then :\\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{2}{p}\\\\Bigg)_4 \\\\equiv i^\\\\frac{a b}{2}\\\\pmod{p}. (Note that i2 ‚â° ‚àí1 (mod p).) In fact,Lemmermeyer, Prop. 5.4 let p = a2 \\\\+ b2 = c2 \\\\+ 2d2 = e2 ‚àí 2f2 ‚â° 1 (mod 8) be prime, and assume a is odd. Then :\\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{2}{p}\\\\Bigg)_4 =\\\\left(-1\\\\right)^\\\\frac{b}{4} =\\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{2}{c}\\\\Bigg) =\\\\left(-1\\\\right)^{n+\\\\frac{d}{2}} =\\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{-2}{e}\\\\Bigg), where (\\\\tfrac{x}{q}) is the ordinary Legendre symbol. Going beyond the character of 2, let the prime p = a2 \\\\+ b2 where b is even, and let q be a prime such that (\\\\tfrac{p}{q})=1.

They all assume that p = a2 \\\\+ b2 and q = c2 \\\\+ d2 are primes where b and d are even, and that (\\\\tfrac{p}{q})=1. Gosset's version is : \\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{q}{p}\\\\Bigg)_4 \\\\equiv\\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{a/b - c/d}{a/b+c/d}\\\\Bigg)^\\\\frac{q-1}{4}\\\\pmod{q}.

Note thatLemmermeyer, Ex. 5.13 :\\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{ac+bd}{p}\\\\Bigg)=\\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{p}{q}\\\\Bigg)\\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{ac- bd}{p}\\\\Bigg). =Miscellany= Let p ‚â° q ‚â° 1 (mod 4) be primes and assume (\\\\tfrac{p}{q})=1.

Let p = 1 + 4x2 be prime, let a be any odd number that divides x, and let a^*=\\\\left(-1\\\\right)^\\\\frac{a-1}{2}a. ThenLemmermeyer, Ex. 6.5, credited to Sharifi a* is a biquadratic residue (mod p). Let p = a2 \\\\+ 4b2 = c2 \\\\+ 2d2 ‚â° 1 (mod 8) be prime. ThenLemmermeyer, Ex. 6.11, credited to E. Lehmer all the divisors of c4 ‚àí p a2 are biquadratic residues (mod p). The same is true for all the divisors of d4 ‚àí p b2. Gaussian integers =Background= In his second monograph on biquadratic reciprocity Gauss displays some examples and makes conjectures that imply the theorems listed above for the biquadratic character of small primes. He makes some general remarks, and admits there is no obvious general rule at work. He goes on to say > The theorems on biquadratic residues gleam with the greatest simplicity and > genuine beauty only when the field of arithmetic is extended to imaginary > numbers, so that without restriction, the numbers of the form a + bi > constitute the object of study ... we call such numbers integral complex > numbers.Gauss, BQ, ¬ß 30, translation in Cox, p. 83 [bold in the original] These numbers are now called the ring of Gaussian integers, denoted by Z[i]. Note that i is a fourth root of 1. In a footnote he adds > The theory of cubic residues must be based in a similar way on a > consideration of numbers of the form a + bh where h is an imaginary root of > the equation h3 = 1 ... and similarly the theory of residues of higher > powers leads to the introduction of other imaginary quantities.Gauss, BQ, ¬ß > 30, translation in Cox, p. 84 The numbers built up from a cube root of unity are now called the ring of Eisenstein integers. The \\"other imaginary quantities\\" needed for the \\"theory of residues of higher powers\\" are the rings of integers of the cyclotomic number fields; the Gaussian and Eisenstein integers are the simplest examples of these. =Facts and terminology= Gauss develops the arithmetic theory of the \\"integral complex numbers\\" and shows that it is quite similar to the arithmetic of ordinary integers.Gauss, BQ, ¬ß¬ß 30‚Äì55 This is where the terms unit, associate, norm, and primary were introduced into mathematics. The units are the numbers that divide 1.Gauss, BQ, ¬ß 31 They are 1, i, ‚àí1, and ‚àíi. They are similar to 1 and ‚àí1 in the ordinary integers, in that they divide every number. The units are the powers of i. Given a number Œª = a + bi, its conjugate is a ‚àí bi and its associates are the four numbers : Œª = +a + bi : iŒª = ‚àíb + ai : ‚àíŒª = ‚àía ‚àí bi : ‚àíiŒª = +b ‚àí ai If Œª = a + bi, the norm of Œª, written NŒª, is the number a2 \\\\+ b2. If Œª and Œº are two Gaussian integers, NŒªŒº = NŒª NŒº; in other words, the norm is multiplicative. The norm of zero is zero, the norm of any other number is a positive integer. Œµ is a unit if and only if NŒµ = 1. The square root of the norm of Œª, a nonnegative real number which may not be a Gaussian integer, is the absolute value of lambda. Gauss proves that Z[i] is a unique factorization domain and shows that the primes fall into three classes:Gauss, BQ, ¬ß¬ß 33‚Äì34 * 2 is a special case: 2 = i3 (1 + i)2. It is the only prime in Z divisible by the square of a prime in Z[i]. In algebraic number theory, 2 is said to ramify in Z[i]. * Positive primes in Z ‚â° 3 (mod 4) are also primes in Z[i]. In algebraic number theory, these primes are said to remain inert in Z[i]. * Positive primes in Z ‚â° 1 (mod 4) are the product of two conjugate primes in Z[i]. In algebraic number theory, these primes are said to split in Z[i]. Thus, inert primes are 3, 7, 11, 19, ... and a factorization of the split primes is : 5 = (2 + i) √ó (2 ‚àí i), :13 = (2 + 3i) √ó (2 ‚àí 3i), :17 = (4 + i) √ó (4 ‚àí i), :29 = (2 + 5i) √ó (2 ‚àí 5i), ... The associates and conjugate of a prime are also primes. Note that the norm of an inert prime q is Nq = q2 ‚â° 1 (mod 4); thus the norm of all primes other than 1 + i and its associates is ‚â° 1 (mod 4). Gauss calls a number in Z[i] odd if its norm is an odd integer.Gauss, BQ, ¬ß 35. He defines \\"halfeven\\" numbers as those divisible by 1 + i but not by 2, and \\"even\\" numbers as those divisible by 2. Thus all primes except 1 + i and its associates are odd. The product of two odd numbers is odd and the conjugate and associates of an odd number are odd. In order to state the unique factorization theorem, it is necessary to have a way of distinguishing one of the associates of a number. Gauss definesGauss, BQ, ¬ß 36 an odd number to be primary if it is ‚â° 1 (mod (1 + i)3). It is straightforward to show that every odd number has exactly one primary associate. An odd number Œª = a + bi is primary if a + b ‚â° a ‚àí b ‚â° 1 (mod 4); i.e., a ‚â° 1 and b ‚â° 0, or a ‚â° 3 and b ‚â° 2 (mod 4).Ireland & Rosen, Ch. 9.7 The product of two primary numbers is primary and the conjugate of a primary number is also primary. The unique factorization theoremGauss, BQ, ¬ß 37 for Z[i] is: if Œª ‚â† 0, then :\\\\lambda = i^\\\\mu(1+i)^ u\\\\pi_1^{\\\\alpha_1}\\\\pi_2^{\\\\alpha_2}\\\\pi_3^{\\\\alpha_3} \\\\dots where 0 ‚â§ Œº ‚â§ 3, ŒΩ ‚â• 0, the œÄis are primary primes and the Œ±is ‚â• 1, and this representation is unique, up to the order of the factors. The notions of congruenceGauss, BQ, ¬ß¬ß 38‚Äì45 and greatest common divisorGauss, BQ, ¬ß¬ß 46‚Äì47 are defined the same way in Z[i] as they are for the ordinary integers Z. Because the units divide all numbers, a congruence (mod Œª) is also true modulo any associate of Œª, and any associate of a GCD is also a GCD. =Quartic residue character= Gauss proves the analogue of Fermat's theorem: if Œ± is not divisible by an odd prime œÄ, thenGauss, BQ, ¬ß 51 :\\\\alpha^{N \\\\pi - 1} \\\\equiv 1 \\\\pmod{\\\\pi} Since NœÄ ‚â° 1 (mod 4), \\\\alpha^{\\\\frac{N\\\\pi - 1}{4}} makes sense, and \\\\alpha^{\\\\frac{N\\\\pi - 1}{4}}\\\\equiv i^k \\\\pmod{\\\\pi} for a unique unit ik. This unit is called the quartic or biquadratic residue character of Œ± (mod œÄ) and is denoted byGauss defined the character as the exponent k rather than the unit ik; also, he had no symbol for the character.There is no standard notation for higher residue characters in different domains (see Lemmermeyer, p. xiv); this article follows Lemmermeyer, chs. 5‚Äì6 :\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi}\\\\right] = i^k \\\\equiv \\\\alpha^{\\\\frac{N\\\\pi - 1}{4}} \\\\pmod{\\\\pi}. It has formal properties similar to those of the Legendre symbol.Ireland & Rosen, Prop 9.8.3 :The congruence x^4 \\\\equiv \\\\alpha \\\\pmod{\\\\pi} is solvable in Z[i] if and only if \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi}\\\\right] = 1.Gauss, BQ, ¬ß 61 :\\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}{\\\\pi}\\\\Bigg]=\\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi}\\\\Bigg]\\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\pi}\\\\Bigg] :\\\\overline{\\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi}\\\\Bigg]}=\\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{\\\\overline{\\\\alpha}}{\\\\overline{\\\\pi}}\\\\Bigg] where the bar denotes complex conjugation. :if œÄ and Œ∏ are associates, \\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi}\\\\Bigg]=\\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\theta}\\\\Bigg] :if Œ± ‚â° Œ≤ (mod œÄ), \\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi}\\\\Bigg]=\\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\pi}\\\\Bigg] The biquadratic character can be extended to odd composite numbers in the \\"denominator\\" in the same way the Legendre symbol is generalized into the Jacobi symbol. As in that case, if the \\"denominator\\" is composite, the symbol can equal one without the congruence being solvable: :\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right] = \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi_1}\\\\right]^{\\\\alpha_1} \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\pi_2}\\\\right]^{\\\\alpha_2} \\\\dots where \\\\lambda = \\\\pi_1^{\\\\alpha_1}\\\\pi_2^{\\\\alpha_2}\\\\pi_3^{\\\\alpha_3} \\\\dots :If a and b are ordinary integers, a ‚â† 0, b > 1, gcd(a, b) = 1, thenIreland & Rosen, Prop. 9.8.3, Lemmermeyer, Prop 6.8 \\\\left[\\\\frac{a}{b}\\\\right] = 1. =Statements of the theorem= Gauss stated the law of biquadratic reciprocity in this form:proofs are in Lemmermeyer, chs. 6 and 8, Ireland & Rosen, ch. 9.7‚Äì9.10 Let œÄ and Œ∏ be distinct primary primes of Z[i]. Then :if either œÄ or Œ∏ or both are ‚â° 1 (mod 4), then \\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{\\\\theta}\\\\Bigg] =\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{\\\\pi}\\\\right], but :if both œÄ and Œ∏ are ‚â° 3 + 2i (mod 4), then \\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{\\\\theta}\\\\Bigg] =-\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{\\\\pi}\\\\right]. Just as the quadratic reciprocity law for the Legendre symbol is also true for the Jacobi symbol, the requirement that the numbers be prime is not needed; it suffices that they be odd relatively prime nonunits.Lemmermeyer, Th. 69. Probably the most well-known statement is: Let œÄ and Œ∏ be primary relatively prime nonunits. ThenLemmermeyer, ch. 6, Ireland & Rosen ch. 9.7‚Äì9.10 :\\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{\\\\theta}\\\\Bigg]\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{\\\\pi}\\\\right]^{-1}= (-1)^{\\\\frac{N\\\\pi - 1}{4}\\\\frac{N\\\\theta-1}{4}}. There are supplementary theoremsLemmermeyer, Th. 6.9; Ireland & Rosen, Ex. 9.32‚Äì9.37Gauss proves the law for 1 + i in BQ, ¬ß¬ß 68‚Äì76 for the units and the half-even prime 1 + i. if œÄ = a + bi is a primary prime, then :\\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{i}{\\\\pi}\\\\Bigg]=i^{-\\\\frac{a-1}{2}},\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{1+i}{\\\\pi}\\\\Bigg]=i^\\\\frac{a-b-1-b^2}{4}, and thus :\\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{-1}{\\\\pi}\\\\Bigg]=(-1)^{\\\\frac{a-1}{2}},\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi}\\\\Bigg]=i^{-\\\\frac{b}{2}}. Also, if œÄ = a + bi is a primary prime, and b ‚â† 0 thenIreland & Rosen, Ex. 9.30; Lemmermeyer, Ex. 6.6, where Jacobi is credited :\\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{\\\\overline{\\\\pi}}{\\\\pi}\\\\Bigg]=\\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{-2}{\\\\pi}\\\\Bigg](-1)^\\\\frac{a^2-1}{8} (if b = 0 the symbol is 0). Jacobi defined œÄ = a + bi to be primary if a ‚â° 1 (mod 4). With this normalization, the law takes the formLemmermeyer, Th. 6.9 Let Œ± = a + bi and Œ≤ = c + di where a ‚â° c ‚â° 1 (mod 4) and b and d are even be relatively prime nonunits. Then :\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\beta}\\\\right]\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha}\\\\right]^{-1}= (-1)^{\\\\frac{bd}{4}} The following version was found in Gauss's unpublished manuscripts.Lemmermeyer, Ex. 6.17 Let Œ± = a + 2bi and Œ≤ = c + 2di where a and c are odd be relatively prime nonunits. Then :\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\beta}\\\\right]\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha}\\\\right]^{-1}= (-1)^{bd+\\\\frac{a-1}{2}d+\\\\frac{c-1}{2}b},\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\left[\\\\frac{1+i}{\\\\alpha}\\\\right]=i^{\\\\frac{b(a-3b)}{2}-\\\\frac{a^2-1}{8}} The law can be stated without using the concept of primary: If Œª is odd, let Œµ(Œª) be the unique unit congruent to Œª (mod (1 + i)3); i.e., Œµ(Œª) = ik ‚â° Œª (mod 2 + 2i), where 0 ‚â§ k ‚â§ 3\\\\. ThenLemmermeyer, Ex. 6.18 and p. 275 for odd and relatively prime Œ± and Œ≤, neither one a unit, :\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\beta}\\\\right]\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\alpha}\\\\right]^{-1}= (-1)^{\\\\frac{N\\\\alpha-1}{4}\\\\frac{N\\\\beta-1}{4}}\\\\epsilon(\\\\alpha)^\\\\frac{N\\\\beta-1}{4}\\\\epsilon(\\\\beta)^\\\\frac{N\\\\alpha-1}{4} For odd Œª, let \\\\lambda^*=(-1)^\\\\frac{N\\\\lambda-1}{4}\\\\lambda. Then if Œª and Œº are relatively prime nonunits, Eisenstein provedLemmermeyer, Ch. 8.4, Ex. 8.19 :\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\mu}\\\\right]=\\\\Bigg[\\\\frac{\\\\mu^*}{\\\\lambda}\\\\Bigg].

TheMarker was founded in 1999 by journalist and entrepreneur Guy Rolnik along with Haaretz group and U.S.-based investors. Five years after TheMarker launched, Haaretz newspaper group decided to terminate its long-standing business section and relaunch it as a daily print newspapers called ‚ÄúTheMarker‚Äù, the brand that was created online. The chief editor of TheMarker is Sami Peretz. The editor of the monthly magazine is Eytan Avriel. TheMarker alone has about 250 employees. It operates from Haaretz newspaper building in Tel Aviv. In 2006 and 2007 TheMarker and Rolnik won the 2 most important awards in marketing and business strategy for creating TheMarker, turning it into the leading brand in financial media and using an internet brand to launch a print newspaper (see ‚ÄúAwards‚Äù). Currently TheMarker produces a website, a daily print newspaper, a monthly print magazine and holds events on business-related issues. Some of TheMarker‚Äôs articles are translated to English and appear in the English version of Haaretz in cooperation with the International New York Times. History TheMarker, founded by Rolnik and Haaretz group, was incorporated in 1999 and launched in March 2000. Joined by his two friends and co-founders ‚Äì Avriel and Ido Pollak ‚Äì Rolnik launched what would become the first business news website and the first online newsroom in Israel. In 2001 TheMarker started publishing a monthly print magazine, TheMarker Magazine. The magazine publishes yearly lists of ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs 100 most influential people‚Äù and ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs 500 richest people‚Äù, which draw considerable attention. In 2003 started organizing business-related events under its own brand. In 2005 Haaretz daily newspaper's economic section was terminated and Haaretz launched ‚ÄúTheMarker‚Äù as a daily newspaper. Following the relaunch, the number of Haaretz's paid subscribers increased significantly: by the end of 2006, the number of paid subscribers rose to all-time high of over 60,000 and ad revenues from TheMarker‚Äôs print edition grew by 50% compared to the pre-rebranding Period. In 2008 the print edition of TheMarker became available as a stand-alone product as well. In 2007 TheMarker launched ‚ÄúTheMarker Caf√©‚Äù, Israel‚Äôs first social network for grown-ups and the first launched by a news organization. Editorial views and opinions In late 2011, TheMarker published a series of articles on three Nordic states ‚Äì Finland, Sweden and Denmark ‚Äì and their brand of economic order, mostly known as The Nordic Model, which is based on a combination of pro-market capitalism, welfare state policies and inclusive collective bargaining. The articles portrayed the countries that are characterized by competition along with a deep regard of humanistic values, whose citizens seem happy with the way things are and enjoy a high standard of living. The series was among the most-read in TheMarker‚Äôs history. TheMarker argued that the stability clause unconstitutional as it prevented future governments from governing by creating laws. TheMarker also argued that the price was not competitive, pointing to the falling global prices of natural gas. Awards and recognition Four of the awards were related to the January 2005 launch of TheMarker as a daily paid for newspaper: Guy Rolnik won the Israel's Marketing Association's ‚ÄúMarketing person of the month‚Äù for July 2005. The judges wrote: ‚ÄúRolnik is the person behind TheMarker‚Äôs latest move ‚Äì the launch of the daily newspaper under TheMarker‚Äôs brand ‚Äì a move that is a unique success. The launch of the new newspaper brought a dramatic change in the newspaper‚Äôs position in the economic arena, a renewal in subscriber additions in Haaretz, a decrease in churning and a strengthening of the loyalty of the readers to the newspaper‚Äù. Later that year he also won the association's ‚ÄúMarketing person of the year‚Äù award. In 2006 TheMarker won the Israeli EFFIE Award in the media category for that year. # In 2007 TheMarker won the EFFIE Platinum award for ‚ÄúBuilding the strongest economic brand in Israel‚Äù, which is awarded to multi-year marketing efforts and is considered the ‚ÄúOscar‚Äù of marketing awards. Some of the personal awards Rolnik won for his journalistic achievements include: # June 2005: The Movement for Quality Government in Israel‚Äôs ‚ÄúKnight of Quality Government‚Äù award. The Movement said that it was awarded Rolnik ‚Äúin gratitude for a unique contribution in the media for uncovering faults and in the public service, for a struggle against corruption and for the improvement of the quality of public sector. In his commentary, Rolnik raises the level of public criticism on the government's behavior and underscores its importance to the improvement of the quality of government. By doing so he sets an example of quality to his colleagues in the media and to Israeli society‚Äù.http://www.mqg.org.il/%D7%94%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%98%D7%95%D7%9F/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%98%D7%95%D7%9F2005/tabid/109/Default.aspx.

In its decision to grant the prize to Rolnik, the jury wrote: ‚ÄúGuy Rolnik untiringly shed light on problems in the structure of the Israeli economy, the judges commented in granting him the award. Notably, Rolnik demonstrated the concentration of capital in the hands of a small number of financial organizations connected to the holders of political and governing power. He exposed grave flaws in the current structure and demanded they be corrected to ensure the existence of a more resilient, just and egalitarian economic system‚Äù. Press mentions In May 2004, HaAyin HaShevi'it interviewed journalists, business people and media experts in Israel who cited Rolnik as an influential columnist: ‚ÄúRolnik writes the most important economic column in Israel, he has no competition. As a member of boards and committees I hear very often people talking about what Rolnik wrote this morning. People read his daily column avidly and with fear. There is no other journalist in Israel that has such position in his field ‚Äì he is the master of the domain‚Ä¶ When he mentions a person or a phenomenon in his column ‚Äì its value will go up‚Äù. A senior executive in the media industry was quoted: ‚ÄúRolnik is the most influential economics journalist in Israel, I read every word he writes. Unlike other journalists he manages to surprise me time and again because his position is so unpredictable‚Äù. In February 2011, The New Yorker's editor, David Remnick, published a story about Haaretz and Schocken, saying \\"Under the leadership of a young, hyper-ambitious editor named Guy Rolnik, TheMarker brought a new, more youthful audience to Haaretz ‚Äî one at least as interested in the high-tech industry as it is in the Palestinian issue ‚Äî just as the worldwide newspaper crisis hit. TheMarker, which can be bought separately, has helped save the paper. Rolnik has been especially good at publishing investigative pieces on what he calls the 'Israeli oligarchs,' a small group of billionaires and their families who control much of the national economy\\". In March 2015, journalist and media critic Michael Massing highlighted the work of TheMarker and Rolnik in an essay ‚ÄúHow to fix American Journalism‚Äù that appeared in the special issue of The Nation magazine for its 150th anniversary. According to Massing, the unique campaign that waged Rolnik as editor-in-chief of TheMarker is the model for fixing American journalism: \\"TheMarker, an Israeli financial newspaper distributed as a supplement to Haaretz, waged an unflagging campaign beginning in the mid-2000s against the extraordinary concentration of economic power in Israel and the dangers that this development posed to Israeli society and democracy. Led by its founding editor, Guy Rolnik, the paper ran periodic stories and columns that paid special attention to the ‚ÄúIsraeli oligarchs,‚Äù a small group of billionaires and their families who controlled much of the Israeli economy. When the campaign began, the subject of economic concentration was barely discussed in Israel. The stories fed growing outrage over inequality, leading to a series of mass demonstrations in 2011.

Early life and family Philip Hendrik Nering B√∂gel was the son of Conraed Laurens Nering and Maria Jacoba (Kraayvanger) B√∂gel. In 1764, the family moved to the Netherlands and Philip later joined the cavalry. He married Lady Georgine Wolffeline Fran√ßoise Lijcklama √† Nyeholt in Oldeboorn, Friesland on April 28, 1782. They settled in Leeuwarden, where Neri worked as a tax collector on land and houses. The couple had five children. Flight to North America In 1793 Nering was accused of using tax funds for personal gain. The province put a reward of 1,000 ducats on his head.https://web.archive.org/web/20140315041725/http://www.historischcentrumleeuwarden.nl/html/nl/1464/Baron_de_Bastrop Via Hamburg - using the pseudonym Bastrop - Philip arrived in Philadelphia with wife and children before the end of the year.https://web.archive.org/web/20140315041725/http://www.historischcentrumleeuwarden.nl/html/nl/1464/Baron_de_Bastrop Around 1800 they lived in Frederick County, Maryland; before 1804 his wife and daughters returned to the Netherlands. Around 1806 he lived in San Antonio, Texas. In Spanish Louisiana Neri introduced himself as a Dutch nobleman, Baron de Bastrop who had fled the country because of the French invasion. People believed his false identity, and Bastrop was soon engaged in many land deals where he made a fortune but later went broke. He received permission from Spain to form a colony in the Ouachita River valley. His contract with Spanish colonial governor Francisco Luis H√©ctor de Carondelet provided for European settlement of 850,000 acres on the Ouachita. Although ninety-nine colonists settled in the area, the project was halted when Louisiana realized its government treasury did not have enough funds to see the colonization to fruition. Career in Texas When Louisiana's sale from France to the United States was finalized, he moved to Texas and received a permit to establish a colony between Bexar and the Trinity River. He moved to San Antonio in 1806, where he posed as a loyal subject who strongly opposed the sale of Louisiana to the USA. In 1810 he was appointed second alcalde, (mayor or chief judicial official), of the Spanish town. In 1820, Neri met with Moses Austin, whose request to bring Anglo-American settlers into Texas had recently been rejected. He had been acquainted with Moses Austin, having formerly shared the hospitality of a roadhouse in then-Spanish Missouri with Moses 20 years before he came to Texas. Neri used his influence to help Moses Austin, and later Stephen F. Austin obtain grants to bring Anglo-American settlers into Texas, later to be called the Old Three Hundred. In 1820, Neri was chosen to be commissioner of colonization for Stephen F. Austin‚Äôs colony. In 1823, he was elected to the provincial deputation of San Antonio, and later the Legislature of Coahuila y Tejas in 1824. Until his death on February 23, 1827, he served the legislature. At the end of his life he lived in Saltillo.https://web.archive.org/web/20140315041725/http://www.historischcentrumleeuwarden.nl/html/nl/1464/Baron_de_Bastrop He did not leave enough money for his burial, so other legislative members paid for it. In his will, he left land to his wife and children in the Netherlands. Years later, his true identity was revealed. Legacy Monument to Neri erected for the 1936 Texas Centennial in Bastrop. Neri was a very important and influential person in the colonization of Texas. Without him, Texas might have never been populated with Anglo-American settlers.

Background Wordsworth, during his early career, often focused on writing in blank verse. However, in March 1798, he began to write a series of poems in ballad meter, which were later added to the Lyrical Ballads.Moorman 1968 p. 369 From October 1798 to February 1799, Wordsworth worked on the \\"Matthew\\" poems along with the \\"Lucy\\" poems and other poems. During this time, Wordsworth was living at Goslar and was separated from Samuel Taylor Coleridge, which caused him to become depressed and feel separation anxiety.Matlak 1978 pp. 46‚Äì47 The thematic similarities between the \\"Lucy\\" and the \\"Matthew\\" poems are so strong that Alan Grob suggests that the two sets of poems should be put \\"under a single heading as the Goslar lyrics of 1799\\".Grob 1973 p. 201 The final poem, \\"Address to the Scholars of the Village School of ‚Äî\\" was written in 1800 in two sections, and was later revised for publication in 1842 with the addition of a third section.Grob 1972 pp. 245‚Äì246 The poems There is some disagreement over which poems make up the \\"Matthew\\" poems. William Knight, based on a note by Wordsworth saying that the subject is related to \\"Matthew\\", to \\"The Two April Mornings\\", and to \\"The Fountain\\", believes that \\"Address to the Scholars of the Village School of ‚Äî\\" should be included in the series.Knight 1896 p. 86 In addition, Mary Moorman includes \\"Expostulation and Reply\\" and its companion, \\"The Tables Turned\\" as part of the series,Moorman 1968 p. 379 and states that lines of \\"Address to the Scholars of the Village School of ‚Äî\\" overlaps with the lines of two Matthew poems that were not published while Wordsworth was alive.Moorman 1968 p. 429 The three \\"Matthew\\" undisputed poems, \\"Matthew\\", \\"The Two April Mornings\\", and \\"The Fountain\\", serve as a dialogue between youth (the narrator) and experience(Matthew).Grob 1973 p. 193 =Matthew= \\"Matthew\\" was originally titled \\"Lines written on a Tablet in a School\\" until 1820, where it was given the title \\"Matthew\\". In 1827 and 1832, it was called by its first line, \\"If Nature, for a favourite child\\", but in 1827 returned to being called \\"Matthew\\".Knight 1896 p. 88 The poem asks that when the reader of the tablet, when looking upon the names listed, :Has travelled down to Matthew's name, :Pause with no common sympathy.(lines 11-12) The narrator then explains that :Poor Matthew, all his frolics o'er, :Is silent as a standing pool; :Far from the chimney's merry roar, :And murmur of the village school. :The sighs which Matthew heaved were sighs :Of one tired out with fun and madness; :The tears which came to Matthew's eyes :Were tears of light, the dew of gladness.(lines 17-24) However, when Matthew would be lost in contemplation, :It seemed as if he drank it up‚Äî :He felt with spirit so profound. (lines 27-28) After describing the character of Matthew, the narrator laments: :--Thou soul of God's best earthly mould! :Thou happy Soul! and can it be :That these two words of glittering gold :Are all that must remain of thee? (lines 29-32) =The Two April Mornings= \\"The Two April Mornings\\" describes a memory of a schoolmaster, Matthew, who remembers on an April morning :A day like this which I have left :Full thirty years behind. (lines 23-24) On that day, he came to visit his daughter's grave to morn over her death, :And, turning from her grave, I met, :Beside the church-yard yew, :A blooming Girl, whose hair was wet :With points of morning dew. (lines 41-44) She reminded him of his daughter, and :There came from me a sigh of pain :Which I could ill confine; :I looked at her, and looked again: :And did not wish her mine! (lines 53-56) Even with her resemblance, Matthew knows that she could not replace Emma. The poem ends with the narrator admitting that experiencing his own remembrance of the departed:Hartman 1967 p. 270 :Matthew is in his grave, yet now, :Methinks, I see him stand, :As at that moment, with a bough :Of wilding in his hand. (lines 57-60 =The Fountain= \\"The Fountain\\" describes the narrator and Matthew noticing a fountain coming from the ground while they sat together. The fountain lightens their moods, and Matthew reveals that the fountain is connected to natural immortality:Mahoney 1997 p. 108 :'Down to the vale this water steers; :How merrily it goes! :'Twill murmur on a thousand years, :And flow as now it flows. (lines 21-24) However, Matthew understands the pains of mortality and is filled with memories of the past: :My eyes are dim with childish tears, :My heart is idly stirred, :For the same sound is in my ears :Which in those days I heard. (lines 29-32) Matthew is quick to point out why this sense of loss that comes from mortality does not lead him down the path of despair: :Thus fares it still in our decay: :And yet the wiser mind :Mourns less for what age takes away :Than what it leaves behind.(lines 33-36) Matthew points out that :My days, my Friend, are almost gone, :My life has been approved, :And many love me; but by none :Am I enough beloved. (lines 53-56) and the narrator offers himself to his friend: :And, Matthew, for thy children dead :I'll be a son to thee! (lines 61-62) Matthew is quick to decline because he knows that the narrator cannot be a substitute for those who are passed.Mahoney 1997 p. 109 =Address to the Scholars= Wordsworth's \\"Address to the Scholars of the Village School of --\\", which Grob describes as \\"one of the least familiar of the 'Matthew' poems\\" was originally a two part poem with the second titled \\"Dirge\\". When it was published in 1842, Wordsworth added a third section, \\"By the Side of the Grave Some Years After\\". The poem describes an individual who is devoted to nature but is disconnected from reality: :He loved the sun, but if it rise :Or set, to him where now he lies, :Brings not a moment's care.(lines 23-25) The narrator remembers Matthew in a secular way and is resigned to a life where he could no longer be with Matthew. It is not until the last section that Christian hope is added: :Such solace find we for our loss; :And what beyond this thought we crave :Comes in the promise from the Cross, :Shining upon thy happy grave. (lines 69-70) Identity On 27 March 1843, Wordsworth wrote to Henry Reed, \\"The character of the schoolmaster, had like the Wanderer in The Excursion a solid foundation in fact and reality, but like him it was also in some degree a composition: I will not, and need not, call it an invention -- it was no such thing.\\"quoted in Knight 1896 p. 87 The character Matthew is likely based on Wordsworth's schoolmaster while at Hawkshead,Abrams 2000 p. 256 note William Taylor, who died in 1786 at the age of 32.Knight 1896 pp. 86-87 However, Moorman argues that the character is most likely based on a \\"Packman\\", or peddler that would visit Hawkshead to sell his wares. The \\"Packman\\" would sing and tell stories, and, with his traveling, resembled the Wanderer from The Excursion.Moorman 1968 pp. 51-53 Themes Loss is an important theme in the \\"Matthew\\" poems; To Geoffrey Hartman, \\"radical loss\\" haunts both the \\"Lucy\\" poems and the \\"Matthew\\" poems.Hartman 1967 p. 285 The \\"Lucy\\" poems, written at the same time as \\"Two April Mornings\\", share their discussion on separation, but the \\"Matthew\\" poems make it clear that a loss cannot truly be replaced.Hartman 1967 p. 160 The \\"Matthew\\" and \\"Lucy\\" poems, which express doubt about the ability of nature to comfort individuals experiencing loss, are thematically unique in Wordsworth's earlier poetry,Grob 1973 p. 192 according to Grob: > the great lyrics written at Goslar, the 'Matthew' poems and the 'Lucy' > poems, strongly indicate that even in the earliest phase, those years when > Wordsworth spoke most confidently of the Utopian possibilities held out to > man by nature, his optimism was tempered by at least momentary misgivings, > recognition that there are areas of human experience, vital to our > individual happiness, in which man is invariably beset by difficulties and > sorrows for which nature could furnish no comforts and surely no > solution.Grob 1973 pp. 10-11 Although there can never be another individual such as Matthew or his daughter, his daughter is able to return to Matthew in his memory, and Matthew is able to return in the memory of the poet. Matthew is able to overcome his feelings of loss through nature,Hartman 1967 p. 289 and, to E. D. Hirsch, there is spirit of affirmation in the poems.Hirsch 1960 p. 84 Matthew serves as a teacher about life and is viewed by the narrator as a source of wisdom. He is capable of rejoicing in nature, but he is also certain of the realities of nature, including death. He is able to mourn without despairing.Mahoney 1997 pp. 108-109 Anne Kostelanetz believes that the poems inhibit a \\"structural irony... which works against the authority of Matthew's statements\\",Kostelanetz 1966 p. 43 and she believes that Matthew \\"has rejected the very essence of nature--the eternal cycle of joy and vitality, the constant possibility of spontaneous delight in the beauty of being\\".Kostelanetz 1966 p. 47 Similarly, David Ferry views \\"The Two April Mornings\\" as Matthew \\"offered a choice between the living and the dead, and he chooses the dead\\".Ferry 1959 p. 64 However, John Danby disagrees, and believes that Matthew merely does \\"not wish her mine, to undergo all the risk of loss again\\".Danby 1960 p. 87 Also, Grob believes that, in \\"The Two April Mornings\\", \\"The most likely explanation... one that receives support from the similar choice made by Matthew in The Fountain\\" is that \\"His rejection of the living child is less a free and reasoned judgment than an emotionally compelled and necessary acquiescence in the unalterable laws of human nature.\\"Grob 1973 p. 195 Critical opinion Grob believes that the \\"Matthew\\" poems are important because they, with the \\"Lucy\\" poems, are different than the other poems that Wordsworth wrote between 1797 and 1800 in their treatment of nature and personal loss. In their difference, they suggest \\"the presence of seeds of discontent even in a period of seemingly assured faith that makes the sequence of developments in the history of Wordsworth's thought a more orderly, evolving pattern than the chronological leaps between stages would seem to imply\\".Grob 1973 p. 204 Notes References * Abrams, M.H.

In 1877, he lost in one of the most famous match races of the nineteenth century ‚Äì a race that had been so anticipated that both houses of Congress were adjourned so members could attend. In 2016, Tom Ochiltree was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. Background Tom Ochiltree was bred by A.J. Alexander's Woodburn Stud and was one of the last offspring of the great foundation stallion, Lexington. He was an enormous colt, eventually reaching high with a girth of 76 inches. According to racing historian Walter Vosburgh, \\"For size, bone, and coarseness, Tom Ochiltree surpassed all contemporaries.\\" Purchased by J. F. Chamberlain at the 1873 Woodburn yearling sale for $500, he was later resold to tobacco heir George Lynde Lorillard. He was named after Colonel Thomas P. Ochiltree, who joined the Texas Rangers at age 14, fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War, became a newspaper editor and served as a United States Congressman. The colt was originally trained by Hall of Fame conditioner Wyndham Walden, the founder of Bowling Brook Farm in Carroll County, Maryland). Tom Ochiltree had two great rivals, Ten Broeck and Parole. Ten Broeck was foaled in the same year as Tom Ochiltree at the neighboring Nantura Stock Farm. Parole was born one year later, bred by Pierre Lorillard IV, the brother and racing rival of Tom Ochiltree's owner.New York Times, 8/09/1876 In 1877, these three would ignite the racing world in one of its biggest match races.Nantura, 1795‚Äì1905 by Jonelle Fisher, St. Crispian Press, 2004 Racing career Because he was still growing, Tom Ochiltree did not race at age two. At three, he won in his career debut in a six-furlong race at Pimlico Racetrack. Two days later, he returned to win the third running of the Preakness Stakes, then run at a distance of miles. He then finished third in the Belmont Stakes and Jersey Derby, and last in the Ocean Hotel Stakes. He was given some time off and was switched to trainer Anthony Taylor. Returning in October, he won the mile Annual Stakes and the two mile Dixie Stakes before finishing third in the Breckenridge Stakes to Aristides, winner of the first Kentucky Derby. Tom Ochiltree finished 1875 with a record of four wins from nine starts and earnings of $6,150. At age four, Tom Ochiltree returned to trainer Walden and became one of the top handicap horses on the east coast. He won eight of ten starts, including the Baltimore Cup at miles, the Jockey Club Handicap at two miles, the Centennial Stakes at miles, the Monmouth Cup at miles, Capital Stakes at three miles, Saratoga Cup at miles, Maturity Stakes at three miles and the Centennial Cup at four miles. One of his few losses that year was to Parole in the -mile All Ages Sweepstakes, but he then beat Parole in the Saratoga Cup despite carrying 21 more pounds than his rival. At age 5, Tom Ochiltree won nine of 14 starts, also finishing second four times. His wins included the Westchester Cup at miles, the Grand National Handicap at miles, the All-Aged Stakes at miles and a second Baltimore Cup at . He beat Parole in both the Grand National and All-Aged Stakes, carrying higher weight every time. At the same time Ten Broeck was winning all his races. These two were then considered the best horses in the Union, with Parole a distant third. In those days, that could mean only one thing: a match race.The History of Thoroughbred Racing in America by William H.P. Robertson, Bonanza Books, New York =The Pimlico Match= On October 24, 1877 at Baltimore, Maryland's Pimlico a \\"match\\" race was run between Parole, Ten Broeck and Tom Ochiltree. It was scheduled for the first day of the October meeting of the Maryland Jockey Club. By this time Ten Broeck (\\"King of the Western Turf\\") was winning everything in the midwest, while Tom Ochiltree and Parole were exchanging wins on the east coast that were so heated that a backer of Parole attempted to poison Tom Ochiltree, an attempt that sickened his stablemate Leander instead. That July Parole had beaten Tom Ochiltree in the Saratoga Cup but Tom Ochiltree had come back and beaten Parole twice that October in the Grand National Stakes and All-Aged Handicap. On the day of the three-way match, perhaps 20,000 people showed up, filling every place in the stands or sitting in their carriages to watch. Both houses of Congress adjourned so that members could attend. At 3:15 in the afternoon the horses went to post. Ten Broeck wore red ribbons in his mane, his stable colors. Parole wore cherry and black. Tom Ochiltree wore orange and blue. In the two and one-half mile race, Ten Broeck immediately led, followed by Tom Ochiltree, then Parole. And so it went in this order for quite some time. Twice Tom Ochiltree made a bid for the lead and won it on his second try. Parole was still trailing. And then, suddenly, Parole came on with a rush, passed both horses and won by four lengths. =Aftermath= The result was a surprise. No one had ever beaten Ten Broeck and Tom Ochiltree had beaten Parole more times than he was beaten. Later, the owners of both horses explained away their losses. Ten Broeck had been seen for some time before the race to have had a cough. As for Tom Ochiltree, before the race Wyndham Walden had telegraphed George Lorillard to warn him Tom Ochiltree had a cough. Lorillard had instructed him to run Tom Ochiltree \\"‚Ä¶so as not to spoil the race.\\" But he also put $500 on Parole's nose. A gelding, Parole raced on, becoming one of the few American horses to win a major English race. Both Ten Broeck and Tom Ochiltree were retired to stud. Tom Ochiltree died on December 29, 1897 at the Middleburg, Maryland farm of his owner Wyndham Walden at the age of 25. In 2016, he was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, joining both Ten Broeck and Parole.

USS ATA-202 was laid down on 24 August 1944 at Port Arthur, Texas, by the Gulfport Boiler and Welding Works. She was launched on 10 October 1944 and commissioned on 8 December 1944. ATA-202 completed her shakedown and training during the latter half of December 1944 and proceeded via the Panama Canal to the Pacific Ocean. On 12 January 1945, she reported for World War II duty with the United States Pacific Fleet and, by late April 1945 had joined Service Squadron (ServRon) 10 at Ulithi Atoll in support of the Okinawa campaign. Late in May 1945, she moved to Okinawa for a brief tour of duty, then returned to her base at Ulithi Atoll in mid-June 1945. It is reasonable to assume that her round- trip voyage to Okinawa was for the purpose of towing battle-damaged ships back to Ulithi Atoll for repair. ATA-202 continued her duty with ServRon 10 through the end of the war, in which hostilities with Japan ceased on 15 August 1945. She was awarded one battle star for her service during World War II. ATA-202 returned to the United States in September 1945, and began nine months of duty in the 11th Naval District at San Diego, California. She was reassigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet's Texas Group at Orange, Texas, in March 1946 and reported there in July 1946. On 27 February 1947, she was decommissioned there and berthed with the Texas Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet. While in reserve, she was renamed USS Wampanoag on 16 July 1948. Wampanoag remained in reserve until 25 February 1959 at which time she was loaned to the United States Coast Guard. In the Coast Guard, she became the USCGC Comanche (WATA-202), later redesignated WMEC-202 as a medium endurance cutter. On 1 June 1969, her name was struck from the Navy List and she was transferred permanently to the Coast Guard. Comanche operated along the United States West Coast from 1959 to 1967. She moved her home port to Corpus Christi, Texas in 1967, then moved it again to Eureka, California, in 1969. She operated from Eureka until decommissioned by the Coast Guard on 30 January 1980 and laid up. She was sold into commercial service in 1991, and operated commercially in the Puget Sound area of Washington until laid up in 2000. In 2007, the Comanche was given to the Comanche 202 Foundation, a non-profit founded on 11 September 2007, for the purpose of preserving, restoring and operating the last complete ATA and the first U.S. Coast Guard Medium Endurance Cutter preserved on the west coast. As of 2015, she has been moored at the Tyee Marina, Tacoma, Washington, during the winter months and during the at the Bremerton Marina, Bremerton, WA and visits other Puget Sounds port. Comanche is frequently open for tours. Comanche is fully operational and makes cruises on the Puget Sound.

The train, which was carrying many German and Polish immigrants, fell through an open swing bridge into the Richelieu River after the crew failed to obey a stop signal. Though uncertain, the widely accepted death toll is 99 people. The disaster remains the worst railway accident in Canadian history.  Background  During the 19th century, the Richelieu River served as an important waterway for trade between New York City and Montreal. Tourism also developed in the area greatly due to the steamboats that travelled up and down the river. The Bel≈ìil Bridge was built as a swing bridge so that the railway would not interrupt the shipping lanes. The bridge connects the present-day municipalities of Otterburn Park, on the river's east bank, with McMasterville, on its west bank. Other nearby municipalities are Mont-St-Hilaire, on the east bank, and Beloeil, on the west bank.  Disaster  On June 29, 1864, a Grand Trunk train carrying between 354 and 475 passengers, many of them German and Polish immigrants, was travelling from Quebec City to Montreal. The passengers had arrived in a ship from Hamburg, Germany, the previous day. Specialized immigration cars, Colonist cars, had not yet been developed for North American immigration, so the passengers were crammed into nine crudely converted box cars and one old passenger car. At around 1:20 a.m. local time the train was approaching the Bel≈ìil Bridge. The swing bridge had been opened to allow the passage of five barges and a steamer ship. A red light ahead of the bridge signalled to the train that the crossing was open and it needed to slow. However, the light was not acknowledged by the conductor, Thomas Finn, or the engineer, William Burnie, and the train continued towards the bridge from the east. Artist's impression of the recovery effort, published in The Illustrated London News. At 1:20 a.m. the train came onto the bridge and fell through an open gap. The engine and eleven coaches fell through the gap one after another on top of each other, crushing a passing barge. The train sank into an area of the river with a depth of . Ninety-nine people aboard the train were killed and 100 more were injured. Among the dead were Thomas Finn and the fireman aboard the train. The engineer was slightly hurt, but was able to escape the wreck. = Response = Survivors were rescued by the crews of the steamer and barges, who in some cases had to chop open the sides of the sinking boxcars. The Grand Trunk Railway sent large numbers of men to assist the recovery and relief efforts the following day. The rescue effort was supported by members of the German Society of Montreal, the St. George's Society of Montreal, the St. Patrick's Society of Montreal and the Irish Protestant Benevolent Society of Montreal. The hospitals and other institutions in nearby Montreal were used for the injured passengers. The dead were also brought to Montreal and buried in the Mount Royal and Roman Catholic cemeteries.Alfred Sandham (1870). Ville- Marie, Or, Sketches of Montreal, p. 169. =Aftermath= The Grand Trunk Railway tried to blame the disaster on the conductor and engineer for failing to obey the standing order to stop before crossing the bridge. The engineer, who had only recently been hired, claimed that he was not familiar with the route and that he did not see the signal. On October 5, 1864, a grand jury placed full responsibility for the disaster on the Grand Trunk Railway for negligence in failing to ensure all trains stopped before crossing the bridge as required by statute: \\"...the Grand Jury consider it their duty to reiterate their solemn conviction that the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada are mainly responsible for the melancholy catastrophe of the 29th of June last, and the great destruction of life caused thereat, and that they trust the said Company will be found amenable to tribunal for their shameful treatment of their numerous passengers on that occasion.\\"Montreal Witness, 8 October 1864, reprinted by Canadian Rail, The Magazine of Canada's Railway History, No. 471 July‚ÄìAugust 1999 pp. 108 ‚Äì 110.

Plot Ellen Pierce (Dorothy McGuire) is very happily married to architect Dan (Van Johnson). However, due to a bout of rheumatic fever in her childhood, her heart is weak and she cannot exert herself too much; how frail she is, she does not really know. Her wealthy father (Louis Calhern) and the family doctor (Ray Collins) have kept from her the fact that she probably only has a few more months to live. When Ellen visits acquaintance Maud Redwick (Ruth Roman), Dan's embittered former girlfriend, Maud reminds her about a vicious remark she had made at Ellen and Dan's wedding that he was only a \\"loan\\" for about a year. That, plus an invitation addressed to Dan to a medical conference and various other clues, leads Ellen to discover the truth, not only about her prognosis, but also an even more devastating secret: that her father had arranged the marriage to make her happy, and that Dan did not love her. When Dan finds out, he confesses via flashbacks that he had initially rejected her father's offer, but due to a lack of success in his career, he had indeed married her at her father's behest. However, he claims that he has since fallen deeply in love with her. He tells her about a Doctor Toynberry who has come up with a new technique that has a good chance of curing her and begs her to undergo the operation he has arranged for her.

Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., 388 U.S. 395 (1967), is a United States Supreme Court decision that established what has become known as the \\"separability principle\\" in contracts with arbitration clauses.McDougall, Andrew de Lotbini√©re and Ioannou, Leon; , Mealey's International Arbitration Report; March 2006; retrieved September 4, 2008. Following an appellate court ruling a decade earlier, it reads the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) to require that any challenges to the enforceability of such a contract first be heard by an arbitrator, not a court, unless the claim is that the clause itself is unenforceable. The case arose from a claim by a New Jersey manufacturer that a Maryland firm had misrepresented itself in a transaction and thus the contract between the two was unenforceable, precluding the arbitration agreed upon in the event of a dispute. Abe Fortas wrote for a 6-3 majority that the FAA was broad enough to require arbitration of all issues save the arbitration clause itself. Hugo Black's dissent called the majority's interpretation overbroad and at odds with Congressional intent in passing the law. He feared it would put legal matters in the hands of arbitrators with little or no legal understanding of it nor duty to follow the law. In subsequent cases concerning the FAA, the Court has reaffirmed the separability principle and held that the FAA and this reading of it apply to arbitrable contracts under state law, even in cases where the contract is alleged to be illegal or state law provides for administrative dispute resolution. This has been seen as expanding the use of arbitration in contracts in the later 20th century, not only those between businesses but between businesses and consumers as well. Background of the case In the early 20th century, businessmen in New York began promoting the idea of legally binding arbitration to resolve disputes as a less costly alternative to litigation. Courts were hostile to the idea, especially in interstate commerce, so in 1925 arbitration advocates persuaded Congress to pass the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), providing rules and a legal framework for arbitration. Among its provisions was a requirement that parties who had agreed to arbitrate do so before going to court. The FAA made no impact on the federal courts until the 1958 Second Circuit decision in Robert Lawrence Co. v. Devonshire Fabrics, Inc., which held that the requirement to arbitrate meant that any challenge to the contract itself had to go before an arbitrator, not just disputes over possible breaches of contract. Only the arbitration clause itself could be challenged in court first. =Instant dispute= Under this framework, in 1964 Prima Paint, of Maryland reached an agreement with Flood & Conklin, a New Jersey paint manufacturer, to purchase the latter's paint business for a percentage of receipts in annual payments of up to $225,000 over a six-year period. In return, Flood & Conklin agreed that its CEO, Jerome Jelin, would personally provide consulting services for Prima and that it would not sell to any of its former customers while the agreement remained in force. Two contracts governed the transaction; both had arbitration clauses. One week after the contracts were executed, Flood & Conklin declared bankruptcy. In 1965, shortly before the first of its annual payments was due, Prima paid its first installment into an escrow account and told Flood's attorneys that it considered the consulting agreement breached. F & C responded with a notice of intent to arbitrate. Near the end of its permitted response period, Prima instead petitioned the Southern District of New YorkVenue was chosen since the contract stipulated arbitration would take place in New York City. to rescind the contracts and enjoin Flood & Conklin from arbitration. Since that company had represented itself as solvent during the negotiations only to go bankrupt shortly after signing the deal, Prima argued, the contracts had been fraudulently induced and thus the arbitration clauses by extension could not be enforced. Litigation history Flood & Conklin responded by denying the fraud allegations in several affidavits and noting that Prima had enjoyed the benefits of the contract for almost a year without complaint. It could not have been unaware of the bankruptcy proceedings, Flood noted, since it had been present at one of the creditors' committee meetings.Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., . The district court, citing Robert Lawrence, rebuffed Prima and ordered the parties to arbitration. An appeal to the Second Circuit was likewise unsuccessful. Since the First Circuit had reached a different conclusion in a similar case in 1960 that the Supreme Court had declined to hear,Lummus Co. v. Commonwealth Oil Ref. Co., cert. denied, . the Court accepted Prima's certiorari petition in order to resolve the issue. Robert Herzog and Martin Cole argued for the parties on March 12, 1967. The American Arbitration Association filed an amicus curiae brief in favor of Flood & Conklin. Decision Abe Fortas wrote for the six-justice majority, and John Marshall Harlan added a one-sentence concurrence saying that he believed Robert Lawrence was also applicable precedent.Prima Paint, 388 U.S. at 406, Harlan, J., concurring. Black was joined in a lengthy dissent by Potter Stewart and William O. Douglas, who had written for an eight-justice majority in Bernhardt v. Polygraphic Co,. an early reading of the Arbitration Act, which declined to compel arbitration in an employment contract on the grounds that the FAA applied only to contracts involving admiralty or commerce =Majority= After reiterating the case history, Fortas considered the case in light of Bernhardt. Since the consulting agreement was inexorably tied to the transfer of business assets from Flood to Prima, it was covered. \\"There could not be a clearer case of a contract evidencing a transaction in interstate commerce\\", he wrote,Fortas, Prima Paint, 388 U.S. at 401. responding to the dissent's suggestion that the language should be more narrowly interpreted.Prima Paint, 388 U.S. 401 n.7. The language of Section 4 of the Act was clear, he continued, that only explicit challenges to the arbitration clause or its inducement were to be properly put before a court in the first instance. \\"[I]t is inconceivable that Congress intended the rule to differ depending upon which party to the arbitration agreement first invokes the assistance of a federal court.\\"Prima Paint, 388 U.S. at 404. Finally, he addressed the constitutionality of the Court's holding in light of Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins,Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins, . which held that the federal courts cannot create a federal common law and must defer to the prevailing state interpretations in substantive matters. =Dissent= Black's four-part dissent was longer than the majority opinion he responded to. He took issue with every aspect of Fortas's reasoning. In his introductory paragraph, he was blunt: He noted that Congress had explicitly not included in the FAA the language it normally used to apply to all commerce, leading him to doubt that the arbitration clause in the consulting agreement was covered by it. Nor did the Act provide as clear an answer as the majority claimed as to what sort of challenges to the formation or execution of the contract might necessarily be first heard by a court. And lastly the majority had not provided sufficient justification for its reading of Bernhardt and Erie Railroad. \\"The Court approves\\", he protested, \\"a rule which is not only contrary to state law, but contrary to the intention of the parties and to accepted principles of contract law ‚Äî a rule which indeed elevates arbitration provisions above all other contractual provisions\\"Prima Pain, 388 U.S. at 411. His second and third sections went into great detail about the legislative history of the FAA, quoting from Montana Senator Thomas J. Walsh's statements about it during hearings and those of the American Bar Association's lobbyists, who had helped draft and pass it, suggesting that it was not meant to be interpreted as the majority and the Second Circuit had. He noted that New York's state Arbitration Act, on which the federal law was based, explicitly provided that a claim of misrepresentation in a contract with an arbitration clause was to be heard by a judge. \\"Thus, 35 years after the passage of the Arbitration Act, the Second Circuit completely rewrote it\\", in Robert Lawrence, whose reasoning the Court was now accepting.Prima Paint, 388 U.S. at 412-424. \\"If Prima's allegations are true,\\" Black concluded,\\"the sum total of what the Court does here is to force Prima to arbitrate a contract which is void and unenforceable before arbitrators who are given the power to make final legal determinations of their own jurisdiction, not even subject to effective review by the highest court in the land.\\"Prima Paint, 388 U.S. at 425. Legacy Prima Paint established in federal jurisprudence what became known as the \\"separability\\" or \\"severability\\" principle in contracts with arbitration clauses, under which a legal fiction is created that the clause itself constitutes a contract separate from the underlying, or \\"container\\", contract. This is similar to the principle of comp√©tence comp√©tence in international arbitration, under which the arbitrator or arbitrators are presumed competent to decide the limits of their own jurisdiction. Starting in the mid-1980s, the Court has greatly expanded the reach of Prima Paint in later cases. Since some of these have applied to the expanded use of arbitration clauses in contracts of adhesion between companies and consumers, some consumer advocates and legal scholars have criticized the decision as the inadvertent opening wedge of an assault on the right to litigate, and a weakening of state contract law and the Erie Railroad principle of deference to state common law. Defenders of the decision have responded that it simply began bringing the U.S. more in line with international arbitration practice, helping American companies compete in a global economy. One, Alan Rau, has also argued that it is justified not just by the Arbitration Act but by general principles of contract law. =Subsequent jurisprudence= The Court would not consider a case involving the FAA for another 17 years. When it did, in Southland Corp. v. Keating,. then-Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote for a 7-2 majority that not only upheld Prima Paint but held that the law applied to arbitration clauses in contracts executed under state law as well. Justices Rehnquist and O'Connor dissented, as they would in subsequent cases where the court upheld that decision. That increased the use of such clauses, as well as legal challenges to them. In the 1990s and 2000s (decade), the Court has compelled arbitration even when the time frame to raise a claim is alleged to have lapsed,. the contract has been alleged to be illegal under state lawBuckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna, or where state law vested dispute resolution authority in a state agency.. Clarence Thomas was the lone dissenter from these two opinions, believing as Rehnquist and O'Connor did that the FAA does not apply to contracts executed under state law. When it comes to contracts where one party disputed whether it had been properly formed, rather than the validity of a formed contract, the Court has been willing to let a court decide the issue. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for a unanimous court in First Options v. Kaplan. that upheld a district-court decision reversing an arbitration award where it was not clear that the respondents had agreed to submit the arbitrability of the question to the arbitrator. =Commentary and criticism= Prima Paint attracted little analysis and commentary in its time, but as it became the foundation for the Court's expansion of the scope of the Arbitration Act and its subsequent application to contracts between consumers and businesses as well as among businesses, its reasoning has been the subject of more legal papers. Critics have reiterated Black's concerns in focusing on how the later decisions have exposed fundamental flaws in Prima Paint, while defenders have found them to reinforce its fundamental soundness. Labor lawyer Zeb-Michael Curtin of the Minneapolis firm Dorsey & Whitney says the Court \\"muddied the clear language of [the FAA]\\" and \\"enabled results contrary to the intentions of the framers of the FAA\\" by embracing the separability doctrine. Richard Barnes of the University of Mississippi has argued that, contrary to Fortas's assertions, Prima Paint and its progeny have created fundamental problems with the Erie Railroad doctrine. \\"The FAA has become a substantive rule of a federal common law applied in virtually all settings and levels of the state and federal systems\\", he says.Barnes, Richard;; 2 Brook.

Richard Reuben of Missouri law school, a longtime critic of mandatory arbitration, calls Prima Paint's adoption of the separability doctrine \\"a perhaps unparalleled display of judicial sophistry\\". He fears it can have negative consequences for society as a whole: \\"By denying citizens the right to a day in court, arbitration imposed through mandatory processes and separability fosters cynicism and distrust in the rule of law, undermining its legitimacy.\\" Defenders of the decision and separability have said that it is necessary for arbitration clauses to have any force, otherwise parties would be able to avoid them too easily by filing suits on any number of grounds. Those whose practice involves arbitrating disputes that are international in scope have credited it with bringing U.S. arbitration law closer to European norms, helping American companies compete and making the U.S. a viable venue for arbitration. In several papers, Alan Scott Rau of the University of Texas law school has gone to a greater extent than Fortas did in grounding Prima Paint and the separability doctrine. He notes that challenges to the arbitration clause are often inseparable from the underlying claim, and that some public policy objectives may be better served by allowing the case to be heard by an arbitrator first. Conversely, he also notes that some challenges to a contract's formation necessarily include a challenge to the arbitration clause in any event, contrary to some recent lower-court decisions.Rau, Alan Scott; Separability in the United States Supreme Court; October 24, 2006; retrieved September 27, 2008.

The construction of the Nerpa submarine was started in 1993, but was then suspended due to lack of funding. The Indian Navy sponsored the building and sea trials of the submarine provided it was given to the Indian Navy on lease for 10 years. It was launched as K-152 Nerpa in October 2008 and entered service with the Russian Navy in late 2009. The submarine was leased to the Indian Navy in 2011 after extensive trials, and was formally commissioned into service as INS Chakra II at a ceremony in Visakhapatnam on 4 April 2012. The INS Chakra joined the Eastern Naval Command at Visakhapatnam. While K-152 Nerpa was undergoing sea trials in the Sea of Japan on 8 November 2008, a fire suppression system was accidentally initiated. The accident killed 20 civilian specialists and navy crew members and injured 21 others. Construction Nerpa was laid down at the Komsomolsk-on-Amur shipyard in 1993, but its completion was delayed for nearly a decade due to a lack of funds caused by the economic crisis of the early 1990s. The partly constructed vessel was mothballed until 2004, when Rosprom (the Federal Agency for Industry) signed an agreement with the Indian government to complete the submarine and lease it to the Indian Navy. The vessel was intended to be completed by 2007, but underwent further delays. In 2007, it was transferred to the Vostok shipyard in the closed city of Bolshoy Kamen, Primorsky Krai, for fitting-out. It was launched in October 2008 for sea trials, following which it was due to be handed over to the Russian Defence Ministry. Reports in the Indian media suggest that the resumption of construction was underwritten with Indian funding. The standards of the vessel's construction were criticised by several commentators. Aleksandr Golts, defence editor of the Yezhednevny Zhurnal newspaper, said that in the 1980s, the Amur shipyard turned out submarines \\"one after another, like pancakes,\\" but from 1993 to 2008 had produced just one. \\"The old specialists had left, and the new ones lacked professionalism.\\" An unnamed worker at the Amur shipyard told Komsomolskaya Pravda that there were \\"questions about the quality of the metal that was used in building the nuclear submarine\\", some of which had been bought from China, and alleged that \\"when the first trials of the submarine were carried out water was leaking in between the seams! So it is not surprising that the work dragged on.\\" During May 2009, the repairs were reported to be almost complete and new sea trials were planned for 15‚Äì20 June.New sea trials of Nerpa submarine set for June ‚Äì paper RIA Novosti 13 May 2009 By October 2009, the work had still not been completed due to the shipyard's electrical supply having been disconnected. Nikolay Povzyk, the head of the shipyard, complained they had not been paid the 1.9 billion roubles (63.8 million dollars) owed for the work carried out on Nerpa. Lease to India INS Chakra of the Indian Navy Chakra in the open sea, flying colours of the Indian Navy As of 2008, Russia had an agreement pending with India worth US$2 billion for the lease of Nerpa and another Project 971 Shchuka-B-class submarine. Of this, K-152 Nerpa will be leased for 10 years to India at an estimated cost of US$670 million. The submarine was handed over to India on 30 December 2011. After being handed over to the Indian Navy, it was commissioned as INS Chakra. Nerpa is the Russian word for the Baikal seal, and Chakra is the mythical weapon of the Hindu god Vishnu. Indian naval crews earlier trained to operate the submarine near St Petersburg and another group of sailors was expected to arrive in Vladivostok in late 2008 for sea trials. The training of the crew was viewed as crucial to India's own nuclear submarine programme, known as the Arihant class submarine. After the 2008 accident, there were conflicting reports over the status of the lease. A Russian defence industry official denied that talks had been held with India on the delivery of the nuclear submarine. \\"Russia did not launch talks on a contract to supply India with the Nerpa nuclear-powered submarine.\\" General of the Army Nikolay Makarov stated that Russia would commission Nerpa and that it would join seven other with Russia's Pacific Fleet. \\"The sum of $650‚Äì780 million, which Rosoboronexport and the Amur Shipbuilding Plant had negotiated over a long period of time with the Indian Ministry of Defence, will now be found in Russia,\\" he said. In May 2009, both Russian and Indian defence officials confirmed that Nerpa would be joining the Indian Navy by the end of 2009, after Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the yard and announced an immediate release of 1.2 billion roubles for the submarine's construction.India to acquire Russian nuclear submarine on lease by year end On 28 December 2009, Nerpa was commissioned and joined the Russian Navy.

A total of 208 people ‚Äì 81 military personnel and 127 civilians ‚Äì were on board at the time of the accident. At least 20 people were killed by asphyxiation and at least 21 more were injured, making it the worst Russian submarine disaster since Kursk sank in 2000. Three of the dead were military personnel and the rest were civilians from the Vostok, Zvezda, Era and Amur shipbuilding yards who were members of the acceptance team.Ren TV, Moscow, 2030 GMT 10 November 2008 The incident involved the accidental triggering of a fire extinguishing system which sealed two forward compartments and released Halon 2402 (freon R-114B2), dibromotetrafluoroethane gas into them. According to survivors, those affected by the gas release were caught off guard and may not have been alerted in time due to warning sirens sounding only after the gas had already begun pouring in. Some of the victims were reported to have been unable to turn on breathing kits before they suffocated. On 10 November, a Russian Navy statement blamed the disaster on an \\"unsanctioned operation\\" of the fire suppression system aboard Nerpa. Preliminary investigations concluded that the system had triggered automatically without human intervention. On 13 November, naval investigators announced that a crewman had turned on the system \\"without permission or any particular grounds\\". 2017 accident Indian media aired public reports in early October 2017 that indicated that INS Chakra had suffered damage while entering Visakhapatnam harbor, including a large hole in the sonar dome in the bow. A Russian team visited India for a joint investigation, which led to the submarine being dry docked for repairs at a cost of ‚Çπ125 crore ($20 million) to fix the damage. 2019 After the 2019 Balakot airstrike that was conducted by the Indian Air Force, the Indian Navy sent INS Chakra along with INS Kalvari (S21) to search for the Pakistani submarine PNS Saad which was believed to be deployed to sea.

Biography  Born in Dewsbury, England, Oscar Monthan moved with his family to Canada and then, in 1900, to Arizona, the United States. The Monthan Family ranched along the Tanque Verde River until 1915 when they purchased a ranch in Vail, Arizona along the Cienega Creek. There the family diverted water from the creek to create a lake for irrigation. The ranch was later known as Rancho De Lago. When the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, Oscar and two of his brothers; Eric and Carl, enlisted in the Army Air Corps. In 1918, Oscar graduated from the Boston School of Technology and also received his pilot's wings that year. In 1920, he became the Chief Engineer at Rockwell Field in San Diego, California. By 1921, Oscar was involved in the latest advances in Aeronautical Engineering in Dayton, Ohio. In 1922, he was in charge of the Air Corps Engineering School at McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio. In these early years of the Army Air Corps (according to the History of the 8th Air Force, July‚ÄìDecember 1948) Lt. Oscar Monthan was known as one of the best and foremost engineers. During this time he became acquainted with General Billy Mitchell. According to Oscar‚Äôs brother, Guy Monthan, who passed the family history on to his son George, General Mitchell and Oscar enjoyed fishing together on the lake at the Monthan ranch when they were on leave. In 1922, Oscar married Mae Pouqette. At the time, Mae was an Army nurse. In 1923, Oscar was Chief Engineer at Luke Field in Hawaii near Honolulu. It was also about the same time General Mitchell was reassigned to the territory of Hawaii. At this time Oscar was considered one of the Army‚Äôs finest aeronautical engineers and was a founding member of the Order of the Daedaleans. On March 27, 1924 Oscar and four other airmen died in the crash of their Martin B2 (NBS-1) bomber while on a training mission. Only 15 of these bombers were made by the Army for Night Bombardment-Short Distance. It was also the bomber that General Mitchell used in the famous ship bombing trials flying out of Langley Field Virginia in 1921. These Martin Bombers sank a destroyer, cruiser and a battleship to prove air power's worth in aerial bombardment. A street on Hickam Air Force Base in Honolulu, Hawaii is named ‚ÄúMonthan Street,‚Äù in honor of Oscar Monthan. On September 23, 1927 Charles Lindbergh dedicated Davis- Monthan Air Field (now Air Force Base) in Tucson, in honor of Lt. Samuel Davis and Lt. Oscar Monthan. Oscar Monthan is buried in Tucson, Arizona.

It is an overhead shooter in which the player can control one of four characters in a dungeon. Get Medieval gameplay is similar to that of Atari's 1985 arcade game Gauntlet. Gameplay It can be played in three modes (Dragon Quest, Random Dungeon, Custom Dungeon) and on four difficulty levels. The game's four player characters: Archer (Eryc), The Barbarian (Zared), The Sorceress (Levina), and The Avenger (Kellina), differ only in speed and strength. The slowest character (Zared) is the strongest, the fastest (Eryc) the weakest. Players can find Attack and Defense upgrades, losing them once their characters die. In the multiplayer mode, the game can be played via hotseat or network. This game came with a world editor called \\"GMedit\\" (or \\"WapWorld\\"), which allows players to make custom levels. Users can do everything that Monolith Games did in their levels, but it does not give a full control on the level. Custom levels can only contain a maximum of five kinds of enemies and their spawners in a specific dungeon.

Stadthuys When Malacca was handed over to the British in the 19th century, the Malacca Free School was opened in the vicinity of the Stadthuys on 7 December 1826, by missionaries residing in the state, in response to a letter dated 19 April 1825, signed by a J. Humprey, J. W. Overee and A. W. Baumgarten, which called for an English institutional education to be built in Malacca. The school which the British provided free education to residents was eventually renamed Malacca High School in 1871 upon a takeover by the British government, and moved out to its present site at Chan Koon Cheng Road in 1931.

They released three albums on Tooth and Nail Records and one with an independent label. Their signature sound is noise pop or space music comparable to Starflyer 59 or the Breeders. Background Before signing to Tooth and Nail, Morella's Forest produced two works: a demo called Bass, and an EP entitled Bozur. Their 1995 debut, Superdeluxe, was produced by Steve Hindalong (The Choir) and Chris Colbert (Fluffy). Its sound was characteristic of 1980s style new wave or 1990s shoegazing. Sonically it featured noisy, \\"dreamy, hypnotic\\" melodies, and featured Bill Campbell of the Throes as a guest. Morella's Forest appeared on the cover of 7ball magazine in September, 1996. Ultraphonic Hiss and From Dayton With Love were produced by Keith Cleversley. Ultraphonic features a sound which moves the band slightly away from the noise of their debut. Dayton features some electronic elements‚Äîkeyboard and drum machine‚Äîand moves their sound to an even more sugary guitar based pop sound, which one reviewer referred to as \\"space age garage pop.\\" Some found this sound to be lacking of \\"solid melodies,\\" while others found the voice of Sydney Rentz layered over the background lively and fluid. The band struggled with the Christian music marketplace, finding the struggle between artistic integrity and profitability hard to maintain. After a half-cancelled tour in 1996 the band reported that although they were still \\"100% about fashion\\" they would direct their efforts toward the general market and emphasize a radio friendly sound. They told 7ball magazine that the only way to make money was to be like dc Talk or Audio Adrenaline, and as for themselves \\"We don't want to be some innovative, cool band that's doing something really weird for the Christian market.\\" Following their 1998 release drummer Nate McCorkle left to join the Christian rock band Johnny Q. Public. The band went through several drummers and played Cornerstone sporadically, but did not generally tour. In 2002 they produced an album entitled Tiny Lights of Heaven. On this album the writing responsibilities were taken by Shawn Johnson instead of long-standing writer Sydney Rentz. With production help from Jesse Sprinkle their music departs a bit from their signature sound, taking a lighter and more indie pop influenced, radio friendly tone.

While in training Smith had a diet that had him consume little water and instead eat a lot of vegetables. He was of the belief that a marathon runner should never look behind themself, as this throws off one's timing while running. He made an exception to this however when he once encountered Tom Longboat while in a race and exchanged a glance with him. This later became a story he would tell his five daughters. Smith was a member and Captain of the Pastime Athletic Club.\\"The New York Times\\" Supposedly Smith was an early underground sports agent. After his athletic career ended he became a sports columnist for The New York Tribune.  Personal life  He was married to a Greek woman named Elizabeth \\"Ellie\\" Poulis. Ellie's parents were from the town of Missolonghi, Aetolia-Acarnania. She was born on Ellis Island while her parents were in quarantine and waiting to be granted entry into the United States. Ellie was a dancer and artist in her younger years. Harry and Ellie were the parents of five girls, Helen, Diana, Patricia \\"Patsy\\", Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" and Joanie. Some time during the 1930s he was the victim of a hit-and- run accident which left him with permanent injury on one of his legs, he was bedridden for a long time and walked with a limp for the rest of his life. This left the family in financial troubles. He and his wife helped raise their daughter, Helen Hart's oldest son Smith when she and her husband, Stu, suffered an automobile accident while she was pregnant with their second child, Bruce. His daughter Diana married Jock Osler descendant of Sir William Osler and his daughter Patsy married a man named Jack Forrest, who was the great great grandnephew of Nathan Bedford Forrest.  Legacy  His granddaughter Diana Hart dedicated the fourth chapter, \\"Roots\\", in her book Under the Mat to discussing Smith's life. She also named her son Harry. The younger Harry is a professional wrestler.

He sang a wide repertoire encompassing material from French composers like Gounod and Massenet to the Italian grand operas of Verdi, the verismo operas of Mascagni, and the German operas of Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss. He sang in numerous premieres during his 30-year career, including the original production of Puccini's La rondine in 1917. Although possessing a rich and warm voice, Huberdeau had a talent for comedic portrayals which made him a favorite casting choice in secondary comedic roles as well as leading roles.J.B. Steane, Grove Music Online After retiring from opera in 1927, Huberdeau remained active as a performer in stage plays and in French cinema throughout the 1930s. Opera career Huberdeau was born in Paris, studied at the Paris Conservatoire and then made his professional opera d√©but at the Op√©ra-Comique in 1898. He sang in smaller roles with that theater over the next ten years, which included a number of secondary roles in premi√®res such as Charpentier's Louise (1900), Camille Erlanger's Le Juif polonais, Massenet's Gris√©lidis (1901), Reynaldo Hahn's La Carm√©lite (1902), Henri Rabaud's La fille de Roland (1904), and Guillaume in Andr√© Messager's Fortunio (1907). In 1908 he joined the roster of Oscar Hammerstein I's Manhattan Opera Company in New York City where he periodically sang leading roles over the next three years. He notably portrayed the Devil in the American premi√®re of Gris√©lidis and sang Orestes in the American premi√®re of Elektra (1910). However, Hammerstein employed Huberdeau more frequently in productions with the Philadelphia Opera Company with which he was highly active between 1909 and 1910.Riemens, A concise biographical dictionary of singers In 1911 Huberdeau became a member of the Chicago Grand Opera Company, remaining with that company until it closed in 1914. He appeared in several notable productions with the company including the American premiere of Wilhelm Kienzl's Der Kuhreigen and the world premiere of Victor Herbert's Natoma. In 1914 he debuted at England's Royal Opera as a visiting artist, where he sang M√©phistoph√©l√®s from Gounod's Faust. That same year he returned to France and served in the First World War in the French army. After being honorably discharged in 1917, Huberdeau joined the Chicago Opera Association where he sang leading roles until 1920. He notably sang in the world premiere of Sylvio Lazzari's Le Saut√©riot (1918), the American premiere of Henry F√©vrier's Gismonda, and the world premiere of Reginald De Koven's Rip Van Winkle (1920). In 1917 Huberdeau sang the role of Rambaldo Fernandez in the original production of Puccini's La rondine with Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo. In 1919‚Äì1920 he sang with the Beecham Opera in London where he appeared as M√©phistoph√©l√®s, Le Comte des Grieux in Massenet's Manon, Ramfis in Verdi's Aida, and Colline in La Boh√®me. He also periodically returned to Covent Garden appearing as Arkel and the Father in the British premi√®re of Pietro Mascagni's Iris (1919) among other roles. In 1921 Huberdeau returned to France where he continued to sing throughout the 1920s in such cities as Paris, Nice, Monte Carlo, Vichy, and Brussels. He sang a wide repertory, which included everything from lead roles to character roles to mute roles. In 1922 he sang in the world premiere of Massenet's Amadis. In 1924 he left France for one year to perform in a number of productions in Amsterdam which included Zuniga in Bizet's Carmen and Golaud in the Dutch premiere of Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande. In 1927, Huberdeau sang his last season in Monte Carlo, which included a portrayal of Hunding in Wagner's Die Walk√ºre. Film and stage career After his opera career ended, Huberdeau continued to perform as an actor on the stage in spoken plays and in French films. His first film role was in the 1931 movie Ronny. His other film appearances include Boule de gomme (1931), Le Million (1931), Mistigri (1931), La Dame de chez Maxim's (1932), Prisonnier de mon coeur (1932), Georges et Georgette (1933), Les Nuits moscovites (1934), Tarass Boulba (1936), and √Ä Venise, une nuit (1937). With the outbreak of World War II, Huberdeau's acting career ended. He died in Paris in 1945. Recordings Huberdeau was among the first generation of musicians to be recorded. He recorded only a few arias around 1910 on Edison cylinder. His recordings show a sturdy voice that is somewhat dry in quality given the limited technology of day.  References  Sources * J.B.

It is also a contributing property to the Red Wing Residential Historic District.  Description and history  The house is one of their more elaborate designs because its owner had a budget that allowed for lavish decoration. The result is comparable to the William Gray Purcell House and the Edward L. Powers House, both in Minneapolis. The horizontal lines of the Prairie School are more pronounced in this house; they are expressed in the bands of art glass windows on both levels and the cantilevered second story. Its owner, E.S. Hoyt, was the president of the Red Wing Stoneware Company. The exterior is clad with brick on the first floor and red stucco on the second floor. The house has ten rooms and about of floor space. It has 99 diamond-paned art glass windows and a considerable amount of quarter sawn white oak wood ornamentation. The second story of the house is cantilevered over the first story. The entrance opens into a hallway that leads to a library on the left and a living room on the right. The living room, dining room, and an enclosed porch are all stretched across the front of the house and provide plenty of light through the art glass windows. Several of these windows provide panoramic views of the Mississippi River. The kitchen is located behind the dining room, although it has been remodeled since its original design. The second floor of the house has four bedrooms and two bathrooms, several of which have corner windows that expand the sense of space. The maid's room, over the kitchen, had a separate staircase.

Isaacson grew up in Melbourne and started working for a newspaper when he was sixteen. He joined the RAAF in 1940. Following his stint in Bomber Command, he became well known in Australia for his tours in the Avro Lancaster Q-for-Queenie to promote the sale of war loans and, in particular, for flying his plane under the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1943. He transferred to the RAAF Reserve after the war, retiring as a wing commander in 1969. From 1956 he served as a Trustee, Chairman, and finally Life Governor of the Victorian Shrine of Remembrance. In 1991 he was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for his publishing and community work.

World War II On 8 December 1940, the nineteen- year-old Isaacson enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). After completing his training in Australia and Canada, he was posted to the United Kingdom and joined No. 460 Squadron RAAF at RAAF Breighton, Yorkshire, as a sergeant pilot.Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, p. 333 Operating Vickers Wellington medium bombers, No. 460 Squadron had been raised under the Article XV provisions of the Empire Air Training Scheme and was one of a number of nominally Australian formations taking part in RAF Bomber Command's strategic air campaign against Germany.Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, p. 649RAAF Historical Section, Bomber Units, pp. 118‚Äì123 The squadron commenced operations in March 1942 and participated in 1,000-bomber raids against Cologne, Essen and Bremen in May and June.

His citation, promulgated in the London Gazette, read: Lancaster Q-for-Queenie flies under Sydney Harbour Bridge, 22 October 1943 Isaacson completed forty-five sorties with Bomber Command, when the likelihood of surviving an operational tour of thirty missions was never more than 50% and, at times, much less.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 95‚Äì96 Promoted to acting flight lieutenant, he was chosen in May 1943 to captain Lancaster Q-for-Queenie on a landmark flight from England to Australia across the Pacific Ocean, and then from Melbourne to New Zealand and back, non-stop in both directions. He was awarded the Air Force Cross on 27 August 1943 for this mission, the citation noting that it was \\"the first occasion on which an aircraft has flown to Australia by this route and the direct flights between Melbourne and New Zealand are the first of their kind\\". The Lancaster was brought to Australia so that it could serve as a template for local production of the type, but this never took place and it was instead used for exhibition flights to encourage purchase of war bonds. On 22 October 1943 Isaacson flew Q-for-Queenie under the Sydney Harbour Bridge, flouting a 1931 regulation that prohibited such activity; the Lancaster remains the largest aircraft to have been flown under the bridge. Isaacson gave his crew no warning of what he was about to do and when asked later why he did it, replied \\"Because it was there\\". It was, however, reported at the time that he undertook the stunt to support the war loan effort for which he and his crew were actively fundraising. Notwithstanding the publicity the escapade generated for war loans, Isaacson recalled that when he landed at Mascot afterwards:Brown, Skylarks, pp. 30‚Äì31 In December 1943, following his promotional tour with his crew in Q-for-Queenie, he settled down to instructional work at an operational training unit before undertaking a further tour in the Lancaster commencing in March 1944.

Commentary  As usual, Mirbeau demystifies and ridicules all that stupid people blindly respect: the law, which is oppressive by nature, and the police, which is arbitrary and repressive by definition; love, a deception, and marriage, a quagmire; wealth, ill-acquired, and social success, a deceptive fa√ßade; the newspapers, which anaesthetize people and provide false information, and the politicians, who are quite indifferent to social misery and concerned only with their own emoluments. Its great originality is to extend the challenge to language itself, thanks to which the dominant classes obtain the submission and the respect of the dominated and perpetuate an inegalitarian social order. Mirbeau succeeds however in making us laugh at that which should really drive us to despair, in the hope that the spark of conscience will help us to live better, to exercise better our liberty of mind, and to rebel against social institutions. Although placing itself in the continuity of medieval morality plays, which had a pedagogical and moralizing purpose, Mirbeau deliberately chose the mood of farce, in which exaggeration, acceleration of the rhythm, caricature, plays on words, the grotesque, and the absurd are acceptable and assure the indispensable distancing effect, without any realism. He anticipates all at once the theater of Bertolt Brecht, Marcel Aym√©, Harold Pinter, and Eug√®ne Ionesco.

Latest massacre by reds; Tartar Population of Elizabethpol Reported Wiped Out. Prelude The disintegration of the Russian Empire resulted in the formation of a number of independent states on its territory. On 28 May 1918, the Azerbaijani National Council declared the independence of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. Twenty-three months later the political power in Azerbaijan was ceded by the ruling Musavat Party to the Bolsheviks to avoid bloodshed that the advancing 11th Red Army might have brought upon the country. On 28 April 1920, Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic was proclaimed. Ganja revolt. The Great Soviet Encyclop√¶dia. Azerbaijan's Sovietisation significantly reduced the Bolshevik pressure on the neighbouring states, which caused much resentment and unrest among demoralised Azerbaijanis shocked by such rapid political change. Civil masses were angered by Bolsheviks' requisitions of provision supplies and their strong and explicit antireligious sentiment. The unrest was also triggered by various political organisations founded by Musavat members who fled to Georgia or went undercover. The anti-Bolshevik attitude went on to spread onto the Azerbaijani army dissatisfied with the Soviets' plan to reorganise it according to the Red Army model by discharging the officers and dividing the units.Swietochowski, Tadeusz. Russian Azerbaijan, 1905-1920: The Shaping of National Identity in a Muslim Community. Part III. New York : Columbia University Press, 1995 The revolt The discharge of the Commander of the Ganja garrison Mahammad Mirza Qajar and his officers led to the strongest civil unrest among Azerbaijanis. On the night of May 25 to 26 1920 the garrison consisting of 1,800 servicemen revolted and seized control over the Muslim quarter of Ganja. They were led by General Qajar, General Javad bey Shikhlinski, General Teymur Novruzov, and Colonel Jahangir Kazimbeyov. The Soviet units which arrived by railway ringed the city. On 29 May, they attempted numerous times to launch an attack but each time were hurled back with heavy casualties. They only became successful upon deploying heavy artillery. Around 1,000 rebels were killed; the rest fled into the mountains to join the units that had been formed there. The battle lasted until 31 May and ended in the Bolshevik victory. Afterwards the city was looted and pillaged for an entire week.Pipes, Richard (1954), The Formation of the Soviet Union, Communism and Nationalism, 1917-1923, p. 228. Harvard University Press Aftermath Azerbaijan People's Commissar for Internal Affairs Hamid Sultanov who was dispatched to Ganja carried out mass repressions against those suspected of being linked to the uprising. Hundreds of people were publicly executed. Twenty-two officers (among them six generals) were immediately exiled on the island of Nargin and shot by firing squad the next day, together with fifty-seven other exiles. The 11th Red Army issued a special decree by which detachments were to strengthen control of Azerbaijani locales with potential civil unrest. They were ordered to seize guns from the population. Those unwilling to turn in their guns were to be shot immediately, and those who turned in their guns and ammunition voluntarily were financially rewarded. The 1920 Ganja revolt initiated a chain reaction of regional rebellions in June 1920 such as one in Shusha led by Nuri Pasha and one in Zagatala led by Molla Hafiz Afandiyev, however neither was as large scale as the Ganja Revolt. Starting in September 1920, a new series of rebellions of various scale took place in Dagestan and Quba, in Garabulag, in Shamkhor, and in Lankaran, overall lasting until 1924.

Pharmaceutical company Baxter International subcontracted the creation of precursor chemicals of Heparin to Scientific Protein Laboratories, an American company with production facilities located in China. Scientific Protein Laboratories then used counterfeit precursors to create the chemicals ordered. Baxter then sold this Heparin contaminated with the counterfeit chemicals in the US, which killed 81 people, and left 785 severely injured. This caught the attention of the News media and the USA Food and Drug Administration leading to numerous ongoing lawsuits. History The raw material for the recalled heparin batches was processed in China from pig's intestines by the American pharmaceutical firm Scientific Protein Laboratories. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration was quoted as stating that at least 81 deaths were believed to be linked to a raw heparin ingredient imported from the People's Republic of China, and that they had also received 785 reports of serious injuries associated with the drug's use. According to The New York Times, \\"problems with heparin reported to the agency include difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, excessive sweating and rapidly falling blood pressure that in some cases led to life-threatening shock.\\" In March 2008, due to contamination of the raw heparin stock imported from Mainland China, major recalls of heparin, a substance widely used as an injectable anticoagulant, were announced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).CBS News, Blood-thinning drug under suspicionFDA informational page with information and links about FDA investigation. Upon investigation of these adverse events by the FDA, academic institutions, and the involved pharmaceutical companies, the contaminant was identified as an \\"over-sulfated\\" derivative of chondroitin sulfate, a closely related substance obtained from mammal or fish cartilage and often used as a treatment for arthritis. Since over-sulfated chondroitin is not a naturally occurring molecule, costs a fraction of true heparin starting material, and mimics the in-vitro properties of heparin, the counterfeit was almost certainly intentional as opposed to an accidental lapse in manufacturing. The raw heparin batches were found to have been cut from 2‚Äì60% with the counterfeit substance, and motivation for the adulteration was attributed to a combination of cost effectiveness and a shortage of suitable pigs in Mainland China. When the FDA conducted an inspection of Baxter's Chinese Heparin supplier, it found serious deficiencies at the facility which the FDA detailed in a warning letter. The Warning Letter detailed that the company failed to monitor changes in the impurity profile of incoming heparin active raw material, to adequately investigate out-of-specification results, to document actual processing steps in batch records, to validate all critical steps in the process, to qualify all suppliers, and to use valid methods to test products. The FDA has stated that it does not have the funds nor bear the responsibility to inspect on a regular basis overseas upstream processors of finished active pharmaceutical ingredients such as heparin. However, according to the internationally harmonized guideline, ICH Q7, API manufacturers are fully responsible for qualifying their suppliers through on-site audits, testing, and regular communications.

Spectasia was first released as a Beta version for Microsoft Windows in July 2006, with the latest stable release on 23 March 2009. The name Chooser refers to a software tool which allows the user to choose items visually, providing a lookable screen layout in which items are easy to spot. The term Chooser was also used for a defunct Macintosh finder application, but there is no direct relationship between the applications. Spectasia has been developed according to the design principles of the Lookable User Interface,See the Spectasia Web site for information on Alan Radley's concept of the Lookable User Interface. which is related to Richard Bolt's concept of \\"Lookable Graphics\\".The Human Interface, Where People and Computers Meet. Lifetime Learning Publications, Richard A.Bolt, 1984 Spectasia is commercial software, and is available for use under a License from MATT Services. History =Design= The design concepts behind Spectasia go back to 2003 and were embedded in Alan Radley's idea for a Lookable User Interface. A number of prototype systems were developed and tested at MATT Services in the UK, and these systems were also demonstrated at major University Departments worldwide including University College London's department of Computer Science (2003), Imperial College London's Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (2003), The University of Hawaii's Department of Computer Science (2003) and the University of Toronto's Computational Vision Group (2005). In particular visits by Alan Radley to Kim H. Veltman at the University of Maastricht in 2002, and later at the VMMI (Virtual Maastricht McLuhan Institute) in 2005 and 2007 produced discussions which were instrumental to the development of the software as it is today. =Form of 3D= Spectasia employs a form of three-dimensional representation or 3D, specifically in order to provide an impression of depth for on-screen item locations. The subject of 3D representation has a long history and the associated literature is now extensive. Fortunately some surveys exist.Bowman DA, Kruijff E, Laviola JL, Poupyrev I (2006) 3D User Interfaces. Theory and Practice. Addison WesleyPanofsky E (1991) Perspective as a Symbolic Form 1991. Zone Books, New YorkVeltman K (1997) The Sources and Literature of Linear Perspective Vols 1 and 2. See http://www.sumscorp.com (Serves as an introduction to an on-line bibliography with over 15,000 titles. See the SUMS reference below It is noteworthy that Spectasia uses curvilinear perspective to present item choices to the user, being a form of perspective which has been ably described in the book Curvilinear Perspective: From Visual Space to the Constructed Image.Curvilinear Perspective: From Visual Space to the Constructed Image Albert Flocon & Andr√© Barre (trans. Robert Hansen) =A Lookable User Interface= Spectasia names its visual representation a Lookable User Interface. A Lookable User Interface (LUI) is a user interface which provides a high degree of visual accessibility for digital content. Typically a LUI enables the user to explore a 3D representation of a large collection of data items or object models. Often these items would comprise a Data Tree or Graph Structure. At any moment, the LUI displays a small region of the overall graph, and the scene is automatically arranged in real time so as to provide good visibility for all of the Items present. An overall visual context is created which allows items to adopt fixed visual reference locations, one relative to one another, and which fosters the visual articulation and mapping of the visual field. LUIs are designed to operate as context interfaces, and inherently provide distinct and notionally fixed visual reference locations for data items. = Beta releases= A number of different Beta versions of Spectasia were released between July 2006 and September 2008. The Beta releases of Spectasia were downloaded more than 50,000 times and no major Bugs were reported. =Announcement= The first stable release announcement for Spectasia (Version 7.2 code name Eos) was originally made on 30 October 2008, and the latest release (Spectasia 2009 Artemis) was made on 23 March 2009. = Public release= The Spectasia 3D Chooser was first publicly released for Microsoft Windows (XP and later only) and Mac OS X on 30 October 2008 in English, officially a stable version. Initial feedback suggests the software has been well received. The latest releases of Spectasia has been through extensive user testing on Windows Vista and Mac OS X. The current software version (Spectasia 2009 Artemis) may work on some versions of Windows XP, but it is not supported on this platform. =Future= Plans are being made to include Spectasia in Dr Kim Veltman's SUMS project.System for Universal Media Searching ‚Äì Dr Kim Veltman, see http://www.sumscorp.com Development Primary design goals were improvements in browsing and choosing efficiency for program, file and Web bookmark links. The software was designed to showcase a new 3D Chooser technology with the potential to provide an alternative to the Menu and List based retrieval methods. Typically with Menus, two problems occur. Either the user must scan through each item on a long list, and scanning becomes tedious. Or else the desired item is buried deep inside another Menu level which you cannot find. With Menus, you waste time reading and re-reading irrelevant options. Menus are not very Lookable because they do not create a sense of place. Items are simply left to float around the screen, and without any fixed locations. Spectasia's 3D shape, on the other hand, has a distinct pattern. Here one place is clearly differentiated from another. The eye can then dart and flit unhindered from one item to another. With Spectasia, browsing and choosing are typically faster and more efficient activities. These efficiency improvements become particularly evident when the number of choices grows beyond 15‚Äì20 items. Code Spectasia consists of around 40,000 lines of Java and Java 3D code. The program internally uses XML, DOM and XSL processing to manage the tree data structures required to render XML and HTML source files into a 3D form in real time. =Version= The current release version of the Spectasia code base is Spectasia 2009 (code name Artemis) which was released on 23 March 2009. Spectasia is available in three separate editions, named Home (the Free edition), and also the Professional and Ultimate editions. =Security= There are no known security issues at present. =Speed= Spectasia has been developed in Java (JRE) and Java3D, and both technologies have been criticized in the past in terms of their performance. However user testing has demonstrated Spectasia to be snappy and responsive, taking only 2‚Äì5 seconds to launch, and with most operations completing in a fraction of a second. =Data Types= Spectasia allows the user to create up to 100 items (Home), 1000 items (Professional) and 10,000 items (Ultimate Edition). It is fully compatible with most common data formats; for example exe, app, .txt, pdf, .doc, .png, .bmp,.jpg, etc. The user can import his or her own Icons into Spectasia in the png format. =Memory= Spectasia typically uses a similar amount of computer RAM memory to a modern web browser, around 100‚Äì200 MB. During particularly intensive sessions, running the program for hours and with multiple imports and system refreshes, memory usage has been seen to approach 500 MB, but the problem has a simple remedy in a 2-3 second reboot. =Stability= Spectasia is very stable and reports of crashes during use are almost non-existent. On Mac OS X systems it has been noted that on occasion Spectasia fails to launch. No work- arounds have been reported other than restarting Spectasia. Spectasia has an automatic repair and recovery system which copes with any data corruptions and takes the system back to the last valid state. = Future Upgrades = Spectasia is an application which is upgraded periodically. = Extensions = No plug-ins or data feeds are currently supported. User Interface Spectasia is a Lookable User Interface, and employs a novel set of display elements and controls. =The Data Wave= Spectasia employs a curvilinear perspective grid, referred to as a \\"Data Wave\\", in order to present Item Choices to the user. Each Wave consists of a number of individual display places which are used to hold Data Items. Each Data Item on the Wave is then represented by an \\"Icon\\". Users are free to create Items, but it is Spectasia that chooses when, where and how to display corresponding Icons on the Wave. =Item Types= Two different Item types can exist on a Wave. Firstly, a Data Item representing a 'clickable' link to a Data resource ‚Äì possibly a local Program, File or else a Web Link to an Internet resource. Secondly a Wave Item which represents another Wave view altogether, which when clicked on brings that Wave's vista into view. =The Data Frame= Each Wave has an invisible 'Data Frame' which holds all of its Data Items. A Data Frame can be broader than a Wave, which can as a result contain hidden Items that lie outside of the current view. These out-of-view Items are temporarily located either to the left or right hand side of the Wave, and can be scrolled into view as described below. =Data Magnification= The Home edition displays data at a single magnification. The Professional and Ultimate Editions allow the user to Zoom the Data Magnification. =Scrolling a Wave= To animate or scroll new regions of an extended Wave into view simply click on the left or right hand side of the screen (lower half), whereupon the entire network of Items on that Wave will animate smoothly in the indicated direction. Clicking closer to the middle of the screen (horizontally) scrolls at a slower speed and for a smaller number of data Items, whilst clicking towards the edge of the screen maximizes both scrolling speed and the number of Items moved. Scrolling is only enabled in the left / right direction. =Scroll Indicators= When an extended Data Wave has Items located outside of the current view, then Spectasia indicates this fact with a small Sphere which appears on the left or right hand side of the Wave. The presence of a Sphere indicates that the Wave can be scrolled in that direction. =Item selection= Spectasia has two different Item selection modes. Firstly you can left-click over an Item with the mouse, causing it to either \\"run\\" or else to \\"open-up\\" if it is a Wave. Secondly, in order to select an Item for deletion or else for a New Icon action, you can right-click over the Item. =Wave navigation= Selecting a Wave Item causes Spectasia to bring into view another vista, containing all of the Items present on that Wave. Simply clicking on subsequent \\"Wave Icons\\" allows the user to navigate his or her way through the various Waves. To move back up the Wave structure to a parent Wave simply right-click the mouse anywhere on the Spectasia window whereupon the parent Waves contents will once again be animated into view. =Creating Items= It is easy to create program, file and web links in Spectasia. You can simply drag and drop Items from your desktop into the Spectasia window, whereupon they will be inserted as Data Items into the current Wave's view. Creating a new Wave is performed by typing a Wave name into the text box on the Status Bar, and then pressing the return key, whereupon Spectasia will create a new Wave Item. Likewise Website Links can be created similarly ‚Äì and here you will enter the website address into the text box. e.g. www.spectasia.com. =Browser Integration= With some browsers it is possible to simply Drag and Drop a Web Link directly from your Browser Window and into Spectasia. This action is not supported in all Browsers, but this functionality has been tested successfully on Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari. Spectasia supports the importing of Browser Bookmarks from a number of common Browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari etc. =Other Features= Spectasia has many other features and we suggest that interested users download and try the software out for themselves.

One of the city's main squares, it was built in 1934Turn back time and retrieve Dizengoff Square, Haaretz, Yigal Hai and inaugurated in 1938. Name Dizengoff Square is named for Zina (Tzina), the wife of Tel Aviv's first mayor, Meir Dizengoff. Its original 1930s design was called \\"the √âtoile of Tel Aviv\\" due to the form of the square ‚Äì a roundabout at the meeting of six streets. History =Early history (1930s-70s)= Dizengoff Square, photographed between 1940 and 1946. The square, built in 1934, was part of the original urban plan by Sir Patrick Geddes, and was designed by architect Genia Averbuch. The idea to build a parking lot under the square went unrealized, and instead a roundabout was fashioned around the square, at its center a garden with a fountain and shady seating areas. For decades the square was a popular location and one of the landmarks of Tel Aviv's historic \\"White City.\\" The square is a circular plaza and has been a focal point of Tel Aviv since its establishment in the 1930s,Dizengoff Street, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica its location in the very heart of Tel Aviv being one of the reasons. =Redesign (1970s)= A picture showing the former split-level layout (2010) The square's Fire and Water Fountain, behind it the Esther cinema. In 1978, however, the former split-level configuration was introduced, during Shlomo Lahat's tenure as mayor, with Dizengoff traffic flowing beneath it. The plan was by architect Tsvi Lissar, of Lissar Architects and City Planners.Squares in a round hole, Haaretz, Shani Shiloh It was elevated in an effort to ease congestion in the area. The square was rebuilt using an entirely different design: the square was covered with an elevated pedestrian plaza above Dizengoff Street, Pinsker Street and Reines Street.Tel Aviv, Frommer's The pedestrian area is elevated, connected by ramps to the adjacent sidewalks and to the pedestrian areas of Ben Ami and Zamenhoff streets, while traffic uses the lower level. The changes met with furious reactions, but the city authorities explained at the time that these were necessary to solve traffic problems. =Center and fountain (1980s)= The square stands from Dizengoff Center, construction of which began in 1972 and was not completed until 1983. A fountain bearing a Glass Statue made by Allen David was erected in the middle of the square during its redesign in the 1970s, and was replaced in 1986 with Yaacov Agam's now landmark kinetic sculpture fountain. The Fire and Water fountain was located in the center of the elevated, second square and will be reinstalled in the third street-level square once work on its core finishes; an underground infrastructure chamber will be built for the Fountain. Hotel Cinema detail =Redevelopment (2000s)= There were proposals however to return Dizengoff Square to its original state in order to restore its popularity. In 2007, Tel Aviv's municipal engineer, Hezi Berkovich, explained how they wanted to \\"avoid split- levels, raised or sunken, in the center of town, and currently the square cuts off the line of sight that is so important for pedestrians, who do not walk along the street sidewalks and do not enjoy them. They simply go up and down at the square. Over the years, the square and the houses surrounding it deteriorated together\\". In addition, they would want to move Agam's sculpture elsewhere in Tel Aviv. Former Mayor Lahat, who was mayor when the redesigned square was brought in, also favours restoring the square to street level, saying that destroying the original square to solve congestion was the one mayoral decision he regretted. He said that, \\"I am responsible, and I take the blame,\\" and that \\"we changed the square, and all the greenery, the beauty and the pleasantness went. Now it is possible to do something really beautiful and impressive,\\" referring to the potential redevelopment of the square. =Restoration (2010s)= In 2012, the fountain was restored, freshly painted and repaired.Israel‚Äôs Most Famous Fountain Is Back In Use 2012 In addition, the benches were repainted blue. =Redesign (2016-18)= Dizengoff Square in June 2018 In 2016 Tel Aviv municipality decided to bring the square back to its original design and move it back to street level, causing public controversy.http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.723598 The works on demolishing the elevated square began on January 8, 2017 and a ground-level road, similar in layout to the underpass under the heightened square, was opened on January 18. At that point, work began on tiling the sidewalk rim and paving a permanent circular road. The circular road, which maintains the second square's traffic directions, was opened ‚Äì though in an unfinished state ‚Äì on October 30, with the interchange-style road being closed, and demolished a day later to allow work on the third square's core to begin. On June 2, 2018, all roadworks on the Third square's circular road were completed: its remaining closed section, running from Reines St. to Dizengoff St., was opened, and the crosswalks were brought closer to the square's core.  Activity  Audio guided tours around the square were offered by Bauhaus Center Tel Aviv. Twice a week, a second-hand market took place at the bottom level; it was subsequently moved to Giv'on Square due to the square's reconstruction. The beis medrash (synagogue/study hall) of the Koidanover Rebbe, Rabbi Yaakov Tzvi Meir Ehrlich, is located in Dizengoff Square. This beis medrash serves as an outreach center where weekly lectures and a Friday- night Oneg Shabbat attract many secular Jews and guide them towards religious observance. The Koidanover Rebbe is well known as an inspiring speaker and educator.

Manufactured by Pacific Car & Foundry Co., it was a substantial upgrade over the Diamond T M19 transporter/trailer duo introduced in 1940. Nicknamed the Dragon Wagon, it was replaced by the 10 ton 6x6 M123 semi-tractor beginning in 1955.http://www.trucksplanet.com/updates/index.php?page=317  Development  In 1942 a new 40 ton semi-trailer tank transporter was needed with better off- road performance than the M9 24 small-wheel trailer, and greater capacity than the 30 ton 8 large-wheel Shelvoke and Drewry semi-trailers used by the Diamond T tractor unit. Designed by the Fruehauf Trailer Company of Detroit, Michigan, it was heavier than the Diamond T could manage. A companion M26 tractor was designed by the San Francisco-based Knuckey Truck Company. When it could not keep up with the Army's demands, production was awarded to the Pacific Car & Foundry Co. of Seattle, Washington. Designated TR-1 by Pacific Car, the chain- driven 12-ton 6x6 M26 tractor was powered by a Hall-Scott 440 6-cylinder gasoline engine developing at 2000 rpm and at 1200 rpm. Developed for the M26, it was used to uprate the Diamond T. Some 2,100 Type 440s were built. Baxter notes \\"over 1,300\\" M26 and M26A1 being built. Unusually, the tractor unit was fitted with both an armored cab and two winches with a combined pull of 60 tons, allowing it to do light battlefield recovery work. A later unarmored version of the M26 tractor was designated the M26A1. An experimental ballast tractor conversion was evaluated by the British Fighting Vehicle Proving Establishment After the war, some of them (both armored and unarmored) were bought as surplus and used to carry oversize loads such as transformers, locomotives and heavy equipment.

He became the leader of his own band that consisted of almost 50 members (leheni). Popular tradition portrays him as a protector to the poor people of the region. There are few written references left of him and his activities. The many folk songs and the few prose legends that still survive in Prykarpattia portray him as a local hero who robbed the rich and helped the poor serfs, like the legendary Robin Hood. His residence is believed to be located near the city of Bolekhiv in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. It is a rock complex that is called the Rocks of Dovbush which was nominated in the seven historical and seven natural wonders of Ukraine. Dovbush's deeds became so admired that the tales of his acts spread beyond the Hutsul region to the neighboring Pokuttia and Podillya regions of western Ukraine. His portraits were sold at local market places. He was feared by Polish szlachta (landowning nobility). Once, a military expedition of 2000 soldiers, headed by Polish magnate J√≥zef Potocki, was sent to stop his activities. Nonetheless, he could not be captured. Dovbush was shot and mortally wounded by one Stefan, the husband of his lover Dzvinka, in 1745.http://pisni.org.ua According to Hassidic legend, Dovbush at one time hid in the house of Baal Shem Tov and gave him his pipe as a token of friendship. Legacy After his death, his legacy was extended by several of his companions and/or people that idolized him: Vasyl Bayurak (a memorial plate is erected in Ivano-Frankivsk that mentions of his execution), Maksym Zalizniak, Ustym Karmaliuk, and many others. His legend entered Ukrainian folklore and was the subject of various artistic works, by, among others, the writers Ivan Franko and Yuriy Fedkovych.

Rajneesh Foundation International was a 1985 lawsuit filed by Helen Byron in Portland, Oregon, against Rajneesh Foundation International, the organization of Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (now known as Osho). Byron had been recruited to join the Rajneesh movement by her daughter, Barbara. She traveled to India to join her daughter and the organization. Byron provided over US$300,000 to the organization, and some of the money was used to buy an armored Rolls Royce for Rajneesh. Byron spoke to the legal leader of the organization, Ma Anand Sheela (Sheela Silverman), and requested that her money be returned, asserting that it was a loan. Sheela reportedly told her that the money would be returned to her once the group moved to Oregon. Byron followed the organization to its location in Oregon, known as Rajneeshpuram, and requested through an attorney that her money be returned. In 1985, she filed a lawsuit against the organization in federal court, in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. Both Byron and Sheela testified in the case: Byron testified that her money was a loan to the organization to purchase land in India, and Sheela that the money was a donation to the organization. A survey submitted by the Rajneesh organization in the case was deemed unreliable by the judge because the survey had been conducted by volunteers who were also members of the organization. The jury decided in favor of Byron, and awarded her her money plus punitive damages. Subsequent to the jury decision, Ma Anand Sheela and an inner circle of followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh at Rajneeshpuram compiled a hit list of people they planned to murder, including both Helen and Barbara Byron, as well as United States Attorney Charles Turner and Oregon Attorney General David Frohnmayer. Sheela and other followers obtained handguns in Texas and false identification in New York, but the plot was never carried out. Byron requests return of money from Rajneesh Helen C. Byron, originally from Santa Fe, New Mexico, was recruited into the Rajneesh movement by her daughter Barbara J. Byron, who had previously joined the group in India. She traveled to India and joined her daughter as a follower of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh in 1978. Within the Osho movement Helen Byron was known as Ma Idam Shunyo, and Barbara J. Byron was referred to as Makima. Byron gave considerable sums of money to Rajneesh, and lent or contributed more than US$300,000 to his group which was used to purchase an armored Rolls Royce for him. Byron requested the money be returned to her and said it was a loan, and stated that the legal leader and president of the Rajneesh organization, Ma Anand Sheela, had only asked for the money on a temporary basis. Byron stated Sheela was aware that Byron needed the money returned for treatment and special needs related to her multiple sclerosis. James T. Richardson writes in the 2004 book Regulating Religion that \\"Ma Sheela is alleged to have stalled Mrs. Byron, using the reasoning that the group was soon to relocate in Oregon, and that the money would be returned after that.\\" Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh moved to Oregon and Byron moved as well, and communicated through a lawyer to Rajneesh that she still requested the return of her money. According to the Associated Press, Byron left the organization in 1984 after Ma Anand Sheela requested followers commit themselves to a lifestyle that Byron did not agree with. Portland federal trial Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh driving one of his Rolls Royces in Rajneeshpuram in 1982 Byron filed a lawsuit against Rajneesh Foundation International claiming she had been defrauded by the organization, and the suit proceeded to a six-member jury trial in 1985 in federal court Portland, Oregon. Byron's claim included $309,990 she stated she had given as a loan to the Rajneesh Foundation, in addition to $80,000 she had deposited in a Rajneeshee bank, and $1.5 million in punitive damages. Byron testified at trial that the $309,990 was given in 1980 as a loan to Rajneesh Foundation International for the organization to buy land in Poona, India, and that the $80,000 was to be held in safekeeping, while Ma Anand Sheela testified that Byron's money was a donation and not a loan. Rajneesh Foundation International submitted an opinion survey in the case, but the survey was conducted by volunteer members of the organization itself. Participants in the survey were able to identify the volunteers as members of the Rajneesh organization, and the court ruled that the results of the survey were unreliable. The trial concluded on May 25, 1985. The jury decided Byron's money should be returned to her, in addition to $1.25 million in punitive damages against Rajneesh Foundation International. The total amount awarded to Byron by the jury was $1.64 million, and the jury concluded that Byron had been deliberately misled by Sheela. The jury, composed of three women and three men, came to the conclusion that Ma Anand Sheela committed a \\"wanton\\" violation of Byron's trust, and that Byron had been under Sheela's \\"domination\\". The jury came to its decision after deliberating for just over two hours. Ma Anand Sheela, the spokesman for Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh at the time, stated that the jury verdict shows \\"Rajneeshees can't get a fair trial in Oregon\\". Sheela characterized the lawsuit as part of the government's plan to \\"destroy the Rajneeshees\\" by utilizing \\"poison\\" of former followers, and said that the organization would appeal the verdict. Rajneesh spokeswoman Ma Prem Isabel stated: \\"I think Oregonians basically are trying to bring their bigotry into the court, and until now they are doing pretty good. We'll see how they do on appeal. This is witchhunting if I ever saw it. I know the government is out to get this community.\\" Rajneeshee attorney Swami Prem Niren (Philip Toelkes) argued before the United States District Court for the District of Oregon in November 1985 that the financial situation of the Rajneesh organization was such that it would take time to sell off assets to raise capital. He attempted to block execution of the jury judgment against the organization. Judge Owen Panner ruled that the judgment and collateral for paying it would remain, due to the uncertain financial circumstances of the Rajneesh organization. Byron received $975,000 of the judgment on November 27, 1985. Judge Panner refused to order Byron to return the funds to the Rajneesh organization. According to Byron's attorney, the Rajneeshees paid for a majority of the judgment by signing over a Southern California building owned by the organization to her. According to Richardson, this was partly done in order to avoid the appeal process, since the Rajneeshees at the time were busy dealing with a plethora of other legal matters. Richardson notes that \\"in every disputed point of fact in the case the jury sided with the plaintiff, Mrs. Byron, and they chose as well to punish by awarding punitive damages\\". The jury also awarded Byron the return of money for which no records existed. Assassination plot After the jury decision, Ma Anand Sheela gathered an inner circle of at least three or four women followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh at Rajneeshpuram and assembled a hit list of enemies of the organization. In total the former personal secretary to Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh along with three others planned to murder nine people. This list included journalist for the Portland paper The Oregonian, Leslie Zaitz, United States Attorney Charles Turner, Oregon Attorney General David Frohnmayer, Rajneesh's former secretary Laxmi Thakarsi Kuruwa (Ma Yoga Laxmi), and Helen Byron along with her daughter Barbara who had testified on her behalf at trial. Frohnmayer was originally intended to be the first murder victim, but Turner was made the primary target because the followers believed there were soon to be federal indictments against the organization. Sheela and three other individuals purchased handguns in Texas, obtained false identification in New York, and waited near Turner's house in Portland. In addition to Sheela, other followers involved in the plot reportedly included Ma Shanti Bhadra (Catherine Jane Stork) and Ma Yoga Vidya (Ann Phyllis McCarthy). The assassination plot against Turner was never carried out, and actions against others on the list were never fully executed. Notes References  * Further reading *Byron v.

Designed by BFLS (formerly Hamiltons), it is one of the tallest residential buildings in London and more than 1,000 residents live in its 408 flats. The building Strata SE1 is located on the site of Castle House, an early 1960s six-storey office building, which was the first commercial premises at the newly rebuilt Elephant & Castle. When completed, Castle House was warmly received. The Architects' Journal in August 1962 found \\"little to criticise and much to praise and until New Zealand House is completed it is possibly one of the best examples for anyone wanting to look at a good office block in London.\\" 25% of the building's flats have been sold by Family Mosaic Housing Association for shared-ownership sale. These consist of the \\"Esprit Apartments\\" ‚Äî located on floors 2‚Äì10 of the tower ‚Äî and a further nine flats in the adjacent \\"Pavilion\\", a three-storey structure located to the west of the tower and earmarked for former residents of the nearby Heygate Estate. Each floor of the affordable area comprises 10 flats (equally divided between one and two- bedroom flats), while each floor above the 10th floor contains 11 flats in a mixture of studios, one-bedroom flats, two-bedroom flats, and three-bedroom flats to a total of 310 units. Only the open-market flats have access to car- parking (in the basement of the building). The 39th floor features a \\"Sky Lobby\\" (a small corridor with a view over central London), while the living area is topped by a ¬£2.5m three-bedroom duplex penthouse. The ground floor comprises two commercial units. A third one is located in the Pavilion, along with a \\"kiosk\\". All three remain unoccupied. The top of the building features three wind turbines, although they are rarely used. The one-level basement of the building contains a secure car park and 437 bicycle storage places. =Construction= The core rising in June 2008. Strata as seen from Cannon Street, City of London, September, 2020 The current tower was first proposed in 2005; construction began in 2007 and was completed in June 2010. The cost is estimated at ¬£113.5 million. The building was 'topped out' in June 2009. Attended the topping out ceremony were over 70 senior members of London's business community including Sir Simon Milton, Deputy Mayor for Policy and Planning, Cllr Nick Stanton, Leader of Southwark Council and MP for North Southwark and Bermondsey, Simon Hughes. The turbines were installed in May 2010. During the demolition of Castle House to clear land for Strata, a construction worker, John Walker, 33, father of two was killed when a roof collapsed on him. He was employed by 777 Demolition and Haulage Company Ltd, which was served with a Prohibition Notice by the Health & Safety Executive. An inquest was due to be held at Inner London South Coroner's Court. In November 2015, both companies were fined several hundred thousand pounds as a result of their negligence. =Sustainability= Strata SE1 was one of the first buildings in the world to incorporate wind turbines as part of its structure. Ramb√∏ll, the engineering consultancy involved with the Bahrain World Trade Center, which also features wind turbines, was involved in the project. The three wind turbines at the top of the building are rated at 19 kW each and were anticipated to produce a combined 50MWh of electricity per year, enough to power 8% of the energy needs of the building, sufficient to supply the building's communal areas. The turbines were criticised as \\"greenwashing\\" by the panel of the 2010 Carbuncle Cup, and residents were reporting in 2010 that the turbines barely moved. In 2014, the Guardian reported that the turbines had \\"remained stationary ever since\\". In 2010, the building exceeded by 13% the then-current UK regulations relating to sustainability, whilst overall carbon emissions were expected to be 15% lower than the Mayor of London's good practice benchmark. The developers expected that the building would achieve 2050 CO2 target emissions and that (with the Multi-Utility Services Company in place in the area) it would achieve a predicted 73.5% reduction in CO2 emissions when measured against the Building Regulations benchmark. Featured on-site is a combined heat and power system to provide sustainable power generation, with a provision for the collection of rainwater for re-use. The energy costs per flat are envisaged to be up to 40% less than Britain's typical housing average. The building is clad in a \\"bespoke high thermal performing fa√ßade\\" with an air permeability leakage rate that is apparently 50% better than current building regulations.

It was introduced as the DECchip 21064 before it was renamed in 1994. The 21064 is also known by its code name, EV4. It was announced in February 1992 with volume availability in September 1992. The 21064 was the first commercial implementation of the Alpha ISA, and the first microprocessor from Digital to be available commercially. It was succeeded by a derivative, the Alpha 21064A in October 1993. History The first Alpha processor was a test chip codenamed EV3. This test chip was fabricated using Digital's 1.0-micrometre (Œºm) CMOS-3 process. The test chip lacked a floating point unit and only had 1 KB caches. The test chip was used to confirm the operation of the aggressive circuit design techniques. The test chip, along with simulators and emulators, was also used to bring up firmware and the various operating systems that the company supported. The production chip, codenamed EV4, was fabricated using Digital's 0.75 Œºm CMOS-4 process. Dirk Meyer and Edward McLellan were the micro-architects. Ed designed the issue logic while Dirk designed the other major blocks. Jim Montanaro led the circuit implementation. The EV3 was used in the Alpha Development Unit (ADU), a computer used by Digital to develop software for the Alpha platform before the availability of EV4 parts. The 21064 was unveiled at the 39th International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) in mid-February 1992. It was announced on 25 February 1992, with a 150 MHz sample introduced on the same day. It was priced at $3,375 in quantities of 100, $1,650 in quantities between 100 and 1,000, and $1,560 for quantities over 1,000. Volume shipments began in September 1992. In early February 1993, the price of the 150 MHz version was reduced to $1,096 from $1,559 in quantities greater than 1,000. On 25 February 1993, a 200 MHz was introduced, with sample kits available, priced at $3,495. In volume, it was priced at $1,231 per unit in quantities greater than 10,000. Volume orders were accepted in June 1993, with shipments in August 1993. The price of the 150 MHz version was reduced in response. The sample kit was reduced to $1,690 from $3,375, effective in April 1993; and in volume, it was reduced to $853 from $1,355 per unit in quantities greater than 10,000, effective in July 1993. With the introduction of the Alpha 21066 and the Alpha 21068 on 10 September 1993, Digital adjusted the positioning of the existing 21064s and introduced a 166 MHz version priced at $499 per unit in quantities of 5,000. The price of the 150 MHz version was reduced to $455 per unit in quantities of 5,000. On 6 June 1994, the price of the 200 MHz version was reduced by 31% to $544 to position it against the 60 MHz Pentium; and the 166 MHz version by 19% to $404 per unit in quantities of 5,000, effective on 3 July 1994. The Alpha 21064 was fabricated at Digital's Hudson, Massachusetts and South Queensferry, Scotland facilities. =Users= The 21064 was mostly used in high-end computers such as workstations and servers. Users included: * Aspen Systems in its Alpine workstations * Carrera Computers in its Hercules 150, Hercules 200, and Pantera II workstations * Cray Research, which used the 150 MHz 21064 in its Cray T3D supercomputers * Digital, in its DECpc AXP 150 entry-level workstations, DEC 2000 AXP entry-level servers, DEC 3000 AXP workstations and entry-level servers, DEC 4000 AXP mid-range servers and DEC 7000/10000 AXP high-end servers * Encore Computer, in its Infinity R/T high- end real-time computer =Performance= The 21064 was the highest performing microprocessor from when it was introduced until 1993, after International Business Machines (IBM) introduced the multi-chip POWER2. It subsequently became the highest performing single-chip microprocessor, a position it held until the 275 MHz 21064A was introduced in October 1993.Ryan 1994 Description The Alpha 21064 is a superpipelined dual-issue superscalar microprocessor that executes instructions in-order. It is capable of issuing up to two instructions every clock cycle to four functional units: an integer unit, a floating-point unit (FPU), an address unit, and a branch unit. The integer pipeline is seven stages long, and the floating-point pipeline ten stages. The first four stages of both pipelines are identical and are implemented by the I-Box. =I-box= The I-box is the control unit; it fetches, decodes, and issues instructions and controls the pipeline.Digital Equipment Corporation 1996, p. 2-3-2-4 During stage one, two instructions are fetched from the I-cache. Branch prediction is performed by logic in the I-box during stage two. Either static prediction or dynamic prediction is used. Static prediction examined the sign bit of the displacement field of a branch instruction, predicted the branch as taken if the sign bit indicated a backwards branch (if sign bit contained 1). Dynamic prediction examined an entry in the 2,048-entry by 1-bit branch history table. If an entry contained 1, the branch was predicted as taken.Digital Equipment Corporation 1996, p. 2-5 If dynamic prediction was utilized, the branch prediction is approximately 80% accurate for most programs. The branch misprediction penalty is four cycles.Dobberpuhl 1992, p. 37 These instructions are decoded during stage three. The I-box then checks if the resources required by the two instructions are available during stage four. If so, the instructions are issued, providing they can be paired. Which instructions could be paired was determined by the number of read and write ports in the integer register file. The 21064 could issue: an integer operate with a floating-point operate, any load/store instruction with any operate instruction, an integer operate with an integer branch, or a floating-point operate with a floating-point branch. Two combinations were not permitted: an integer operate and a floating-point store, and a floating-point operate and an integer store. If one of the two instructions cannot be issued together, the first four stages are stalled until the remaining instruction is issued. The first four stages are also stalled in the event that no instruction can be issued due to resource unavailability, dependencies, or similar conditions. The I-box contains two translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) for translating virtual addresses to physical addresses. These TLBs are referred to as instruction translation buffers (ITBs). The ITBs cache recently used page table entries for the instruction stream. An eight-entry ITB is used for 8 KB pages and a four-entry ITB for 4 MB pages. Both ITBs are fully associative and use a not-last used replacement algorithm.Digital Equipment Corporation 1996, p. 2-6 =Execution= Execution begins during stage five for all instructions. The register files are read during stage four. The pipelines beginning at stage five cannot be stalled. Integer unit The integer unit is responsible for executing integer instructions. It consists of the integer register file (IRF) and the E-box. The IRF contains thirty-two 64-bit registers and has four read ports and two write ports that are equally divided between the integer unit and the branch unit.Dobberpuhl 1992, pp. 35-36 The E-box contains an adder, a logic unit, barrel shifter, and multiplier. Except for multiply, shift, and byte manipulation instructions, most integer instructions are completed by the end of stage five and thus have a latency of one cycle. The barrel shifter is pipelined, but shift and byte manipulation instructions are not completed by the end of stage six, and thus have a latency of two cycles. The multiplier was not pipelined in order to save die area;McLellan 1993, p. 42 thus multiply instructions have a variable latency of 19 to 23 cycles depending on the operands. In stage seven, integer instructions write their results to the IRF. Address unit The address unit, also known as the \\"A-box\\", executed load and store instructions. To enable the address unit and integer unit to operate in parallel, the address unit has its own displacement adder, which it uses to calculate virtual addresses, instead of using the adder in the integer unit.McLellan 1993, p. 43 A 32-entry fully associative translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is used to translate virtual addresses into physical addresses. This TLB is referred to as the data translation buffer (DTB). The 21064 implemented a 43-bit virtual address and a 34-bit physical address, and is therefore capable of addressing 8 TB of virtual memory and 16 GB of physical memory. Store instructions result in data buffered in a 4-entry by 32-byte write buffer. The write buffer improved performance by reducing the number of writes on the system bus by merging data from adjacent stores and by temporarily delaying stores, enabling loads to be serviced quicker as the system bus is not utilized as often. Floating-point unit The floating- point unit consists of the floating-point register file (FRF) and the F-box.Dobberpuhl 1992, p. 36 The FRF contains thirty-two 64-bit registers and has three read ports and two write ports. The F-box contained a floating-point pipeline and a non-pipelined divide unit which retired one bit per cycle. The floating-point register file is read and the data formatted into fraction, exponent, and sign in stage four. If executing add instructions, the adder calculates the exponent difference, and a predictive leading one or zero detector using input operands for normalizing the result is initiated. If executing multiply instructions, a 3 X multiplicand is generated. In stages five and six, alignment or a normalization shift and sticky-bit calculations are performed for adds and subtracts. Multiply instructions are multiplied in a pipelined, two-way interleaved array which uses a radix-8 Booth algorithm.Dobberpuhl 1992, p. 38 In stage eight, final addition is performed in parallel with rounding. Floating-point instructions write their results to the FRF in stage ten. Instructions executed in the pipeline have a six-cycle latency. Single-precision (32-bit) and double-precision (64-bit) divides, which are executed in the non-pipelined divide unit, have a latency of 31 and 61 cycles, respectively.Gwennap 1994 =Caches= The 21064 has two on-die primary caches: an 8 KB data cache (known as the D-cache) using a write- through write policy and an 8 KB instruction cache (known as the I-cache). Both caches are direct-mapped for single-cycle access and have 32-byte line size. The caches are built with six-transistor static random access memory (SRAM) cells that have an area of 98 Œºm2. The caches are 1,024 cells wide by 66 cells tall, with the top two rows used for redundancy. An optional external secondary cache, known as the B-cache, with capacities of 128 KB to 16 MB was supported. The cache operated at one-third to one-sixteenth of the internal clock frequency, or 12.5 to 66.67 MHz at 200 MHz.McLellan 1993, p. 44 The B-cache is direct-mapped and has a 128-byte line size by default that could be configured to use larger quantities. The B-cache is accessed via the system bus. =External interface= The external interface is a 128-bit data bus that operated at half to one-eighth the internal clock rate, or 25 to 100 MHz at 200 MHz. The width of the bus was configurable, systems using the 21064 could have a 64-bit external interface. The external interface also consisted of a 34-bit address bus. =Fabrication= DEC Alpha 21064 (EV4S) die shot The 21064 contained 1.68 million transistors.Dobberpuhl 1992, p. 35 The original EV4 was fabricated by Digital in its CMOS-4 process, which has a 0.75 Œºm feature size and three levels of aluminium interconnect. The EV4 measures 13.9 mm by 16.8 mm, for an area of 233.52 mm2. The later EV4S was fabricated in CMOS-4S, a 10% optical shrink of CMOS-4 with a 0.675 Œºm feature size. This version measured 12.4 mm by 15.0 mm, for an area 186 mm2.Bhandarkar 1995, pp. 2-4 The 21064 used a 3.3-volt (V) power supply. The EV4 dissipated a maximum of 30 W at 200 MHz. The EV4S dissipates a maximum of 21.0 W at 150 MHz, 22.5 W at 166 MHz, and 27.0 W at 200 MHz.Digital Equipment Corporation 1996, p. 8-3 =Package= A packaged 21064 microprocessor The 21064 is packaged in a 431-pin alumina-ceramic pin grid array (PGA) measuring 61.72 mm by 61.72 mm.Digital Equipment Corporation 1996, p. 8-2 Of the 431 pins, 291 were for signals and 140 were for power and ground.Bhandarkar 1995, p. 2 The heatsink is directly attached to the package, secured by nuts attached to two studs protruding from the tungsten heat spreader. Derivatives =Alpha 21064A= DEC Alpha 21064A (EV45) die shot The Alpha 21064A, introduced as the DECchip 21064A, code-named EV45, is a further development of the Alpha 21064 introduced in October 1993. It operated at clock frequencies of 200, 225, 233, 275 and 300 MHz. The 225 MHz model was replaced by the 233 MHz model on 6 July 1994, which at introduction, was priced at US$788 in quantities of 5,000, 10% less than the 225 MHz model it replaced. On the same day, prices for the 275 MHz was also reduced by 25% to US$1,083 in quantities of 5,000. The 300 MHz model was announced and sampled on 2 October 1995 and was shipped in December 1995. There was also one model, the 21064A-275-PC, that was restricted to running the Windows NT or operating systems that use the Windows NT memory management model. The 21064A succeeded the original 21064 as the high-end Alpha microprocessor. It subsequently saw the most use in high-end systems. Users included: * Digital in some models of its DEC 3000 AXP, DEC 4000 AXP and DEC 7000/10000 AXP systems * Aspen Systems in its Alpine workstation * BTG, who used a 275 MHz model in its Action AXP275 RISC PC * Carrera Computers in its Cobra AXP 275 workstation * NekoTech, who used a 275 MHz model overclocked by 5% to 289 MHz in their Mach 2-289-T workstation * Network Appliance (now NetApp), who used a 275 MHz model in its storage systems The 21064A had a number of microarchitectural improvements over the 21064. The primary caches were improved in two ways: the capacity of the I-cache and D-cache was doubled from 8 KB to 16 KB and parity protection was added to the cache tag and cache data arrays. Floating-point divides have a lower latency due to an improved divider that retires two bits per cycle on average. Branch prediction was improved by a larger 4,096-entry by 2-bit BHT. The 21064A contains 2.8 million transistors and is 14.5 by 10.5 mm large, for an area of 152.25 mm2. It was fabricated by Digital in their fifth-generation CMOS process, CMOS-5, a 0.5 Œºm process with four levels of aluminium interconnect.Bhandarkar 1995, p. 3 =Alpha 21066= The Alpha 21066, introduced as the DECchip 21066, code-named LCA4 (Low Cost Alpha), is a low-cost variant of Alpha 21064. Samples were introduced on 10 September 1993, with volume shipments in early 1994. At the time of introduction, the 166 MHz Alpha 21066 was priced at US$385 in quantities of 5,000. A 100 MHz model, intended for embedded systems, also existed. Sampling begun in late 1994, with volume shipments in the third quarter of 1995. The Microprocessor Report recognized the Alpha 21066 as the first microprocessor with an integrated PCI controller. The Alpha 21066 was intended for use in low-cost applications, specifically personal computers running Windows NT. Digital used various models of the Alpha 21066 in their Multia clients, AXPpci 33 original equipment manufacturer (OEM) motherboards and AXPvme single board computers. Outside of Digital, users included Aspen Systems in its Alpine workstation, Carrera Computers in its Pantera I workstation, NekoTech used a 166 MHz model in its Mach 1-166 personal computer, and Parsys in its TransAlpha TA9000 Series supercomputers. Due to the process shrink, it was able to include features that were desirable in cost-sensitive embedded systems. These features include an on-die B-cache and memory controller with ECC support, a functionally limited graphics accelerator supporting up to 8 MB of VRAM for implementing a framebuffer, a PCI controller and a phase locked loop (PLL) clock generator for multiplying a 33 MHz external clock signal to the desired internal clock frequency. The memory controller supported 64 KB to 2 MB of B-cache and 2 to 512 MB of memory. The ECC implementation was capable of detecting 1-, 2- and 4-bit errors and correcting 1-bit errors. To reduce cost, the Alpha 21066 has a 64-bit system bus, which reduced the number of pins and thus the size of the package. The reduced width of the system bus also reduced bandwidth and thus performance by 20%, which was deemed acceptable. The 21066 contained 1.75 million transistors and measured 17.0 by 12.3 mm, for an area of 209.1 mm2. It was fabricated in CMOS-4S, a 0.675 Œºm process with three levels of interconnect. The 21066 was packaged in a 287-pin CPGA measuring 57.404 by 57.404 mm. =Alpha 21066A= DEC Alpha 21066A. The Alpha 21066A, code-named LCA45, is a low-cost variant of the Alpha 21064A. It was announced on 14 November 1994, with samples of 100 and 233 MHz models introduced on the same day. Both models were shipped in March 1995. When announced, the 100 and 233 MHz models were priced at $175 and $360, respectively, in quantities of 5,000. A 266 MHz model was later made available. The 21066A was second sourced by Mitsubishi Electric as the M36066A. It was the first Alpha microprocessor to be fabricated by the company. 100 and 233 MHz parts were announced in November 1994. At the time of the announcement, engineering samples were set for December 1994, commercial samples in July 1995 and volume quantities in September 1995. The 233 MHz part was priced at $490 in quantities of 1,000.Krause 1994 Although it was based on the 21064A, the 21066A did not have the 16 KB instruction and data caches. A feature specific to the 21066A was power management ‚Äì the microprocessor's internal clock frequency could be adjusted by software. Digital used various models of 21066A in their products which had previously used the 21066. Outside of Digital, Tadpole Technology used a 233 MHz model in their ALPHAbook 1 notebook. The 21066A contained 1.8 million transistors on a die measuring 14.8 by 10.9 mm, for an area of 161.32 mm2. It was fabricated in Digital's fifth-generation CMOS process, CMOS-5, a 0.5 Œºm process with three levels of interconnect. Mitsubishi Electric fabricated the M36066A in its own 0.5 Œºm three-level-metal process. =Alpha 21068= The Alpha 21068, introduced as the DECchip 21068, is a version of the 21066 positioned for embedded systems. It was identical to the 21066 but had a lower clock rate to reduce power dissipation and cost. Samples were introduced on 10 September 1993 with volume shipments in early 1994. It operated at 66 MHz and had a 9 W maximum power dissipation. At the time of introduction, the 21068 was priced at US$221 each in quantities of 5,000. On 6 June 1994, Digital announced that it was cutting the price by 16% to US$186, effective on 3 July 1994. The Alpha 21068 was used by Digital in their AXPpci 33 motherboard and the AXPvme 64 and 64LC single-board computers. =Alpha 21068A= The Alpha 21068A, introduced as the DECchip 21068A, is a variant of the Alpha 21066A for embedded systems. It operated at a clock frequency of 100 MHz. Chipsets Initially, there was no standard chipset for the 21064 and 21064A. Digital's computers used custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to interface the microprocessor to the system. As this raised development cost for third parties who wished to develop Alpha-based products, Digital developed a standard chipset, the DECchip 21070 (Apecs), for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). There were two models of the 21070, the DECchip 21071 and the DECchip 21072. The 21071 was intended for workstations whereas the 21072 was intended for high-end workstations or low-end uniprocessor servers. The two models differed in memory subsystem features: the 21071 has a 64-bit memory bus and supports 8 MB to 2 GB of parity- protected memory whereas the 21072 has a 128-bit memory bus and supports 16 MB to 4 GB of ECC-protected memory. The chipset consisted of three chip designs: the COMANCHE B-cache and memory controller, the DECADE data slice, and the EPIC PCI controller. The DECADE chips implemented the data paths in 32-bit slices, and therefore the 21071 has two such chips while the 21072 has four. The EPIC chip has a 32-bit path to the DECADE chips. The 21070 was introduced on 10 January 1994,Digital Equipment Corporation 1994 with samples available. Volume shipments began in mid-1994. In quantities of 5,000, the 21071 was priced at $90 and the 21072 at $120. 21070 users included Carrera Computers for its Pantera workstations and Digital in some models of its AlphaStations and uniprocessor AlphaServers.

The dish originated in the city of Lima in the 1950s. It is also popular in Colombian and Brazilian cuisine. It is a rotisserie chicken dish that is a Peruvian version of pollo al spiedo It was developed in Peru in the 1950s by Roger Schuler and Franz Ulrich, who were Swiss residents in the country. Schuler was in the hotel business in Peru. He devised the specific method of cooking the chicken, observing his cook's technique in preparation, and gradually, along with his business partners, perfected the recipe, creating the Granja Azul restaurant in Santa Clara, district of Ate, in Lima. Originally its consumption was specific to high-end restaurants (during the 1950s until the 1970s), but today it is a widely available. The original version consisted of a chicken (cooked in charcoal and marinated only with salt) served with large french fries and traditionally eaten with the fingers, without cutlery, although most modern Peruvians will eat it with a fork and knife. It is almost always served with creamy (mayonnaise-based) sauces, and most frequently with a salsa known as aj√≠. In restaurants all over the United States like in Per√∫, pollo a la brasa is served with a portion of french fries, salad with a homemade ranch sauce, and a variety of sauces depending on the restaurants.

DEC Alpha 21164 (EV5) die shot The Alpha 21164, also known by its code name, EV5, is a microprocessor developed and fabricated by Digital Equipment Corporation that implemented the Alpha instruction set architecture (ISA). It was introduced in January 1995, succeeding the Alpha 21064A as Digital's flagship microprocessor. It was succeeded by the Alpha 21264 in 1998. History First silicon of the Alpha 21164 was produced in February 1994, and the OpenVMS, Digital UNIX and Windows NT operating systems were successfully booted on it. It was sampled in late 1994 and was introduced in January 1995 at 266 MHz. A 300 MHz version was introduced in March 1995. The final Alpha 21164, a 333 MHz version, was announced on 2 October 1995, available in sample quantities. The Alpha 21164 was replaced by the Alpha 21164A as Digital's flagship microprocessor in 1996 when a 400 MHz version became available in volume quantities. =Users= Digital used the Alpha 21164 operating at various clock frequencies in their AlphaServer servers, AlphaStation workstations. Digital also used the Alpha 21164 in their Alpha VME 5/352 and Alpha VME 5/480 single board computers and AlphaPC 164 and AlphaPC 164LX motherboards. Alpha partner Cray Research used a 300 MHz Alpha 21164 in their T3E-600 supercomputer. Third parties such as DeskStation also built workstations using the Alpha 21164. =Performance= The 21164 continued the performance lead from the 275 MHz Alpha 21064A until the introduction of the Intel Pentium Pro in November 1995, when a 200 MHz version outperformed the 300 MHz 21164 on the SPECint95_base benchmark suite. The 21164 retained its floating-point performance lead. The 333 MHz 21164 introduce the following year outperformed the Pentium Pro, but it was later surpassed by the MIPS Technologies R10000 and then by the Hewlett-Packard PA-8000 in the same year.Gwennap 1996 Description The Alpha 21164 is a four-issue superscalar microprocessor capable of issuing a maximum of four instructions per clock cycle to four execution units: two integer and two floating-point. The integer pipeline is seven stages long, and the floating- point pipeline is ten stages long. The 21164 implemented a 43-bit virtual address and a 40-bit physical address. It was therefore capable of addressing 8 TB of virtual memory and 1 TB of physical memory. =Integer unit= The integer unit consisted of two integer pipelines and the integer register file. The two pipelines, the add pipeline and the multiply pipeline are not identical, each are responsible for executing different instructions, although both are capable of executing common add, logical, load, compare, and conditional move instructions. The multiply pipeline exclusively executes shift, store, and multiply instructions (in a non-pipelined multiplier). The add pipeline exclusively executes branch instructions. Except for branch, conditional move, and multiply instructions, all other instructions begin and finish execution during stage five for a one cycle latency. Branch and conditional move instructions are executed during stage six so they can be issued with a compare instruction whose result they depend on. The integer register file contained forty 64-bit registers, of which thirty-two are specified by the Alpha Architecture and eight are for use by PALcode as scratchpad memory. The register file has four read ports and two write ports evenly divided between the two integer pipelines.Bowhill et al., \\"Circuit implementation of a 300-MHz 64-bit second-generation CMOS Alpha CPU\\", p. 124. =Floating-point unit= The floating-point unit consisted of two floating- point pipelines and the floating point register file. The two pipelines are not identical, one executed all floating-point instructions except for multiply, and the other executed only multiply instructions. Both pipelines have four stages. A non-pipelined floating-point divider is connected to the add pipeline. All floating-point instructions except for divide have four- cycle latency. Divides have variable latency that depends on whether the operation is being performed on single or on double precision floating-point numbers and numbers. Including overhead, single precision divides have a 15- to 31-cycle latency, whereas double precision divides have a 22- to 60-cycle latency. =Cache= The 21164 has three levels of cache, two on-die and one external and optional. The caches and the associated logic consisted of 7.2 million transistors.Bowhill et al., \\"Circuit implementation of a 300-MHz 64-bit second-generation CMOS Alpha CPU\\", p. 111. The primary cache is split into separate caches for instructions and data, referred to as the I-cache and D-cache respectively. They are 8 KB in size, direct-mapped and have a cache line size of 32 bytes. The D-cache is dual-ported, to improve performance, and is implemented by duplicating the cache twice. It uses a write-through write policy and an on-read allocation policy. The secondary cache, known as the S-cache, is on-die and has a capacity of 96 KB. An on-die secondary cache was required as the 21164 required more bandwidth than an external secondary cache could supply in order to provide it with enough instructions and data.Gwennap, \\"Digital Leads the Pack with 21164\\", p. 1. The cache required two cycles to access due to its large area. To improve performance, the cache is pipelined. Another benefit of an on-die secondary cache was that it could be easily implemented as a multi-way cache, and as a result, the cache is three-way set associative, offering improved hit rates than direct-mapped caches.Gwennap, \\"Digital Leads the Pack with 21164\\", pp. 1-2. The S-cache, due to the large physical area required, was implemented in two halves which flank the I-box, E-box, F-box and M-box. This was done so the cache could return data in two cycles. The tertiary cache, known as the B-cache, is implemented with external SRAMs. The B-cache was optional and some systems using the Alpha 21164 did not have any. The B-cache could have a capacity of 1 to 64 MB, smaller capacities were not supported as they were rendered useless by the on-die S-cache.Gwennap, \\"Digital Leads the Pack with 21164\\". It is direct-mapped, uses a write-back write policy and an on-write allocation policy. The B-cache is controlled by on-die external interface logic, unlike the 21064, which required an external cache controller. The B-cache could be built with asynchronous or synchronous SRAMs. The B-cache is accessed via the system bus. =External interface= Socket 499 for Alpha 21164 The external interface is a 128-bit system bus. The system bus operates at a clock frequency that is 3 to 15 times lower than the internal clock frequency, or 20 to 100 MHz with an internal clock frequency 300 MHz. The system bus' clock signal is generated by the microprocessor. =Clock= The internal clock frequency is generated by dividing an external clock signal by two. The Alpha 21164 therefore requires an external clock signal of 600 MHz for a 300 MHz Alpha 21164. =Fabrication= The Alpha 21164 contains 9.3 million transistors on a die measuring 16.5 by 18.1 mm (299 mm2), which was close to the maximum limits of the process. The die was fabricated in Digital's fifth-generation complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process, CMOS-5, a 0.50 Œºm process with four levels of aluminium interconnect.Bowhill, et al., \\"Circuit implementation of a 300-MHz 64-bit second-generation CMOS Alpha CPU\\", pp. 100-101. The 21164 used a 3.3-volt (V) power supply. It dissipated 46 W at 266 MHz, 51 W at 300 MHz, 56 W at 333 MHz. =Package= The Alpha 21164 is packaged in a 499-pin ceramic interstitial pin grid array (IPGA) measuring 57.40 by 57.40 mm. The package had a heat spreader with two studs to which the heat sink was bolted. Derivatives =Alpha 21164 (EV56)= A 500 MHz Alpha 21164 (EV56) microprocessor Samsung Alpha 21164 (EV56) die shot The Alpha 21164 was the basis of a further development code-named EV56. It was introduced as the Alpha 21164, but was originally known as the Alpha 21164A. It operated at clock frequencies of 366, 433, 500, 533, 600 and 666 MHz.Alpha 21164 Microprocessor Data Sheet, August 1998, p. 113.Digital Semiconductor 21164 Alpha Microprocessor Product Brief, 31 March 1997, p. 2. History It was first described in October 1995 at the Microprocessor Forum. On 13 November 1995, Digital announced that samples would ship later in the month. The first version, operating at 366 MHz, was introduced in 1996. On 8 July 1996, Digital announced that a 433 MHz version was available and a 500 MHz version was sampling with volume quantities due in September 1996. The 433 MHz version was priced at $1,492 per unit in quantities of 1,000. The 600 MHz version was introduced on 31 March 1997, shipping in volume quantities. Samsung Electronics signed a deal with Digital in June 1996 to second source the Alpha 21164A and the company was the only one to fabricate the 666 MHz model. 366 to 500 MHz samples were introduced on 11 November 1996 with volume availability in 1997. The Alpha 21164A was fabricated at Digital's Hudson, Massachusetts and Samsung's Kihueng, South Korea fabrication plants. Users of the Alpha 21164A included Cray Research, Digital, Network Appliance (now NetApp), and DeskStation. Cray Research used 450, 600 and 675 MHz Alpha 21164As in later models of their T3E supercomputer. Digital used the Alpha 21164A operating at various clock frequencies in their AlphaServers, AlphaStations, Celebris XL workstations and Digital Personal Workstations. NetApp used 400, 500 and 600 MHz Alpha 21164As in their storage systems. DeskStation used the Alpha 21164A in their Raptor Reflex workstations. Description The most notable change was the inclusion of Byte Word Extensions (BWX), an extension to the Alpha Architecture designed to improve byte and word accesses. These instructions are executed by the multiply pipeline. The Alpha 21164A contained 9.66 million transistors on a die measuring 14.4 mm by 14.5 mm, for a die area of 209 mm2.Bouchard, \\"Design objectives of the 0.35 ¬µm Alpha 21164 Microprocessor\\", p. 3, 5. Digital fabricated the die in their sixth generation CMOS process, CMOS-6, a 0.35 Œºm process with four layers of interconnect. Samsung fabricated the die in their 0.35 Œºm process with four layers of interconnect based on a 0.3 Œºm process they developed in early 1996. The Alpha 21164A used a 3.3 V power supply, dissipating 31.0 W at 366 MHz, 36.0 W at 433 MHz, 41.0 W at 500 MHz, 43.5 W at 533 MHz and 48.5 W at 600 MHz. =Alpha 21164PC (PCA56)= The Alpha 21164PC, also known as the PCA56, is a low-cost version of the Alpha 21164A introduced on 17 March 1997. The microprocessor was jointly developed by Digital and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, and both companies fabricated the design. Mitsubishi later suspended the joint development agreement for future Alpha microprocessors with Digital in early 1998 and ceased to fabricate the Alpha 21164PC in mid-1998, exited the Alpha market because the economic conditions in the company's markets.Foremski, \\"Mitsubishi steps back from Alpha\\".Foremski, \\"Mitsubishi Electric stops Alpha microprocessor manufacture\\". The Alpha 21164PC operated at clock frequencies of 400, 466 and 533 MHz. Major changes are the omission of the S-cache, a larger I-cache, and the inclusion of Motion Video Instructions (MVI), an extension to the Alpha Architecture which introduced single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions for improving the performance of MPEG encoding. The S-cache was removed to reduce the transistor count, which reduced the die size and in turn, cost. The I-cache was doubled in capacity to 16 KB from 8 KB to compensate for the lack of S-cache, as the Alpha 21164 relied on the S-cache to complement the I-cache in order to provide enough bandwidth to achieve adequate performance. The amount of B-cache was limited to 512 KB to 4 MB, with 1 and 2 MB capacities also supported. The microprocessor uses a 43-bit virtual address and 33-bit physical address. The Alpha 21164PC contained 3.5 million transistors on a die measuring 8.65 by 16.28 mm, for a die area of 141 mm2. Digital fabricated the die in the same process as the Alpha 21164, CMOS-5. The Alpha 21164PC was packaged in 413-pin IPGA measuring 49.78 by 49.78 mm. It used a 3.3 V power supply, dissipating 26.5 W at 400 MHz, 30.5 W at 466 MHz and 35.0 W at 533 MHz. The Alpha 21164PC was used by Digital in their AlphaPC 164SX motherboard. =Alpha 21164PC (PCA57)= A derivative of the PCA56, the PCA57 was designed and fabricated by Samsung Electronics in a 0.28 Œºm CMOS process. The PCA57 was introduced in late 1998 and operated at clock frequencies of 533, 600 and 666 MHz. Improvements to the PCA56 microarchitecture included doubled I-cache and D-cache capacities: 32 KB and 16 KB respectively. The PCA57 contained 5.7 million transistors on a die measuring 6.7 mm by 15 mm, for a die area of 101 mm2. It operated on a 2.5 V power supply and dissipated 18 W at 533 MHz, 20 W at 600 MHz and 23 W at 666 MHz. The PCA57 was used by Digital in its AlphaPC 164RX motherboard. Chipsets Digital and VLSI Technology developed chipsets for the 21164 and its derivatives. Digital also developed custom application- specific integrated circuit (ASICs) for use in the high-end models of their AlphaServer family such as the AlphaServer 8200 and 8400. =21171= The 21171, also known as Alcor, was the first chipset for the 21164, introduced in January 1995 alongside the microprocessor it supports. It was developed and fabricated by Digital. The 21171 is an upgraded DECchip 21071 modified to support the new system bus protocol the 21164 uses. It consisted of a control chip that contained the memory and PCI controllers, and four data slice chips that interfaced the 256-bit memory bus and PCI bus to the system bus. The 21171 provides a 64-bit wide PCI bus that runs at 33 MHz. =21172= The 21172, also known as Alcor2, was an updated 21171 that supported the 21164A. =Pyxis= The Pyxis chipset, also known as the 21174, supported the 21164A and 21164PC microprocessors. Unlike previous chipsets, it was designed for low-cost systems. As a result, it was a single-chip design packaged in a 474-contact ceramic ball grid array (CBGA) instead of multiple packages.Schumann 1997 It was subsequently used in cost-sensitive applications such as entry-level workstations (Digital Personal Workstation a-Series) and motherboards such as the AlphaPC 164LX and 164SX. When it was introduced, the 21174 was priced at US$142 in quantities of 1,000.Gwennap 1997 The 21174 contains a memory controller and PCI controller. The memory controller supported up to 512 MB of synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM) and accesses it via a 128-bit memory bus. The memory can be either ECC or parity protected. The PCI controller provided a PCI or PCI-X bus. =Polaris= Polaris is a system controller developed by VLSI Technology for personal computers that supports the 21164A and 21164PC microprocessors. Polaris was announced on 16 June 1997.VLSI Technology 1997 It supports up to 768 MB of EDO DRAM or up to 512 MB of SDRAM. The memory is accessed via a 128-bit bus. It provides a 32-bit, 33 MHz PCI bus for I/O. Users of Polaris included Digital, for its AlphaPC 164RX motherboard.  See also  * AlphaVM: A full DEC Alpha system emulator running on Windows or Linux.

External links  *An Overview of the Alpha AXP 21164 Micro- Architecture, lecture by John Edmonson Category:DEC microprocessors Category:Superscalar microprocessors ","title":"Alpha 21164"},{"id":"20133101","text":"Alpha 21264 microarchitecture. The Alpha 21264 is a Digital Equipment Corporation RISC microprocessor introduced in October, 1996. The 21264 implemented the Alpha instruction set architecture (ISA).  Description  The Alpha 21264 or Alpha 7 for short, is a four-issue superscalar microprocessor with out-of-order execution and speculative execution. It has a peak execution rate of six instructions per cycle and could sustain four instructions per cycle. It has a seven-stage instruction pipeline. = Out of order execution = At any given stage, the microprocessor could have up to 80 instructions in various stages of execution, surpassing any other contemporary microprocessor. Decoded instructions are held in instruction queues and are issued when their operands are available. The integer queue contained 20 entries and the floating-point queue 15. Each queue could issue as many instructions as there were pipelines. = Ebox = The Ebox executes integer, load and store instructions. It has two integer units, two load store units and two integer register files. Each integer register file contained 80 entries, of which 32 are architectural registers, 40 are rename registers and 8 are PAL shadow registers. There was no entry for register R31 because in the Alpha architecture, R31 is hardwired to zero and is read-only. Each register file served an integer unit and a load store unit, and the register file and its two units are referred to as a \\"cluster\\". The two clusters were designated U0 and U1. This scheme was used as it reduced the number of write and read ports required to serve operands and receive results, thus reducing the physical size of the register file, enabling the microprocessor to operate at higher clock frequencies. Writes to any of the register files thus have to be synchronized, which required a clock cycle to complete, negatively impacting performance by one percent. The reduction of performance resulting from the synchronization was compensated in two ways. Firstly, the higher clock frequency achievable offset the loss. Secondly, the logic responsible for instruction issue avoided creating situations where the register file had to be synchronized by issuing instructions that were not dependent on data held in other register file where possible. The clusters are near identical except for two differences: U1 has a seven-cycle pipelined multiplier while U0 has a three-cycle pipeline for executing Motion Video Instructions (MVI), an extension to the Alpha Architecture defining single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions for multimedia. The load store units are simple arithmetic logic units used to calculate virtual addresses for memory access. They are also capable of executing simple arithmetic and logic instructions. The Alpha 21264 instruction issue logic utilized this capability, issuing instructions to these units when they were available for use (not performing address arithmetic). The Ebox therefore has four 64-bit adders, four logic units, two barrel shifters, byte-manipulation logic, two sets of conditional branch logic equally divided between U1 and U0. = Fbox = The Fbox is responsible for executing floating-point instructions. It consists of two floating-point pipelines and a floating-point register file. The pipelines are not identical, one executes the majority of instructions and the other only multiply instructions. The adder pipeline has two non-pipelined units connected to it, a divide unit and a square root unit. Adds, multiplies and most other instructions have a 4-cycle latency, a double-precision divide has 16-cycle latency and a double-precision square root has a 33-cycle latency. The floating point register file contains 72 entries, of which 32 are architectural registers and 40 are rename registers. = Cache = The Alpha 21264 has two levels of cache, a primary cache and secondary cache. The level three (L3, or \\"victim\\") cache of the Alpha 21164 was not used due to problems with bandwidth.  Primary caches  The primary cache is split into separate caches for instructions and data (\\"modified Harvard architecture\\"), the I-cache and D-cache, respectively. Both caches have a capacity of 64 KB. The D-cache is dual-ported by transferring data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal. This method of dual-porting enabled any combination of reads or writes to the cache every processor cycle. It also avoided duplication the cache so there are two, as in the Alpha 21164. Duplicating the cache restricted the capacity of the cache, as it required more transistors to provide the same amount of capacity, and in turn increased the area required and power consumed.  B-cache  The secondary cache, termed the B-cache, is an external cache with a capacity of 1 to 16 MB. It is controlled by the microprocessor and is implemented by synchronous static random access memory (SSRAM) chips that operate at two thirds, half, one-third or one-fourth the internal clock frequency, or 133 to 333 MHz at 500 MHz. The B-cache was accessed with a dedicated 128-bit bus that operates at the same clock frequency as the SSRAM or at twice the clock frequency if double data rate SSRAM is used. The B-cache is direct-mapped.The Alpha 21264 Microprocessor Architecture, p. 5. = Branch prediction = Branch prediction is performed by a tournament branch prediction algorithm. The algorithm was developed by Scott McFarling at Digital's Western Research Laboratory (WRL) and was described in a 1993 paper. This predictor was used as the Alpha 21264 has a minimum branch misprediction penalty of seven cycles. Due to the instruction cache's two cycle latency and the instruction queues, the average branch misprediction penalty is 11 cycles. The algorithm maintains two history tables, Local and Global, and the table used to predict the outcome of a branch is determined by a Choice predictor. The local predictor is a two-level table which records the history of individual branches. It consists of a 1,024-entry by 10-bit branch history table. A two-level table was used as the prediction accuracy is similar to that of a larger single-level table while requiring fewer bits of storage. It has a 1,024-entry branch prediction table. Each entry is a 3-bit saturating counter. The value of the counter determines whether the current branch is taken or not taken. The global predictor is a single-level, 4096-entry branch history table. Each entry is a 2-bit saturating counter; the value of this counter determines whether the current branch is taken or not taken. The choice predictor records the history of the local and global predictors to determine which predictor is the best for a particular branch. It has a 4,096-entry branch history table. Each entry is a 2-bit saturating counter. The value of the counter determines if the local or global predictor is used. = External interface = The external interface consisted of a bidirectional 64-bit double data rate (DDR) data bus and two 15-bit unidirectional time-multiplexed address and control buses, one for signals originating from the Alpha 21264 and one for signals originating from the system. Digital licensed the bus to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and it was subsequently used in their Athlon microprocessors, where it was known as the EV6 bus.  Memory addressing  Alpha 21264 CPU supports 48-bit or 43-bit virtual address (256TiB or 8TiB virtual address space repsecitively), selectable under IPR control (using VA_CTL control register). Alpha 21264 supports a 44-bit physical address (up to 16 TiB of physical memory). This is an increase from previous Alpha CPUs (43-bit virtual and 40-bit physical for Alpha 21164, and 43-bit virtual and 34-bit physical for Alpha 21064).  Fabrication  The Alpha 21264 contained 15.2 million transistors. The logic consisted of approximately six million transistors, with the rest contained in the caches and branch history tables. The die measured 16.7 mm by 18.8 mm (313.96 mm¬≤).Gronowski, \\"High Performance Microprocessor Design\\", p. 676. It was fabricated in a 0.35 Œºm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process with six levels of interconnect.  Packaging  The Alpha 21264 was packaged in a 587-pin ceramic interstitial pin grid array (IPGA). Alpha Processor, Inc. later sold the Alpha 21264 in a Slot B package containing the microprocessor mounted on a printed circuit board with the B-cache and voltage regulators. The design was intended to use the success of slot-based microprocessors from Intel and AMD. Slot B was originally developed to be used by AMD's Athlon as well, so that API could obtain materials for the Slot B at commodity prices in order to reduce the cost of the Alpha 21264 to gain a wider market share. This never materialized as AMD chose to use Slot A for their slot-based Athlons.  Derivatives  = Alpha 21264A = The Alpha 21264A, code-named EV67 was a shrink of the Alpha 21264 introduced in late 1999. There were six versions: 600, 667, 700, 733, 750, 833 MHz. The EV67 was the first Alpha microprocessor to implement the count extension (CIX), which extended the instruction set with instructions for performing population count. It was fabricated by Samsung Electronics in a 0.25 Œºm CMOS process that had 0.25 Œºm transistors but 0.35 Œºm metal layers. The die had an area of 210 mm¬≤. The EV68 used a 2.0 V power supply. It dissipated a maximum of 73 W at 600 MHz, 80 W at 667 MHz, 85 W at 700 MHz, 88 W at 733 MHz and 90 W at 750 MHz. = Alpha 21264B = The Alpha 21264B is a further development for increased clock frequencies. There were two models, one fabricated by IBM, code-named EV68C, and one by Samsung, code-named EV68A. The EV68A was fabricated in a 0.18 Œºm CMOS process with aluminium interconnects. It had a die size of 125 mm¬≤, a third smaller than the Alpha 21264A, and used a 1.7 V power supply. It was available in volume in 2001 at clock frequencies of 750, 833, 875 and 940 MHz. The EV68A dissipated a maximum of 60 W at 750 MHz, 67 W at 833 MHz, 70 W at 875 MHz and 75 W at 940 MHz.Compaq, \\"21264/EV68A Microprocessor Hardware Reference Manual\\". The EV68C was fabricated in a 0.18 Œºm CMOS process with copper interconnects. It was sampled in early 2000 and achieved a maximum clock frequency of 1.25 GHz. In September 1998, Samsung announced they would fabricate a variant of the Alpha 21264B in a 0.18 Œºm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (SOI) process with copper interconnects that was capable of achieving a clock frequency of 1.5 GHz. This version never materialized. = Alpha 21264C = The Alpha 21264C, code-named EV68CB was a derivative of the Alpha 21264. It was available at clock frequencies of 1.0, 1.25 and 1.33 GHz. The EV68CB contained 15.5 million transistors and measured 120 mm¬≤. It was fabricated by IBM in a 0.18 Œºm CMOS process with seven levels of copper interconnect and low-K dielectric. It was packaged in a 675-pad flip-chip ceramic land grid array (CLGA) measuring 49.53 by 49.53 mm. The EV68CB used a 1.7 V power supply, dissipating a maximum of 64 W at 1.0 GHz, 75 W at 1.25 GHz and 80 W at 1.33 GHz.Compaq, \\"21264/EV68CB and 21264/EV68DC Hardware Reference Manual\\". = Alpha 21264D = The Alpha 21264D, code-named EV68CD is a faster derivative fabricated by IBM. = Alpha 21264E = The Alpha 21264E, code-named EV68E, was a cancelled derivative developed by Samsung first announced on 10 October 2000 at Microprocessor Forum 2000 slated for introduction at around mid-2001. Improvements were a higher operating frequency of 1.25 GHz and the addition of an on-die 1.85 MB secondary cache. It was to be fabricated in a 0.18 micrometre CMOS process with copper interconnects.  Chipsets  Digital and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) both developed chipsets for the Alpha 21264. = 21272/21274 = The Digital 21272, also known as the Tsunami, and the 21274, also known as the Typhoon, were the first chipset for the Alpha 21264. The 21272 chipset supported one- or two-way multiprocessing and up to 8GB of memory, while the 21274 supported one-, two-, three- or four-way multiprocessing, up to 64GB of memory, and both supported one or two 64-bit 33 MHz PCI buses. They had 128- to 512-bit memory bus which operated at 83 MHz, yielding a maximum bandwidth of 5,312 MB/s. The chipset supported 100 MHz registered ECC SDRAM. The chipset consisted of three devices, a C-chip, a D-chip and a P-chip. The number of devices which made up the chipset varied as it was determined by the configuration of the chipset. The C-chip is the control chip containing the memory controller. One C-chip was required for every microprocessor. The P-chip is the PCI controller, implementing a 33 MHz PCI bus. The 21272 could have one or two P-chips. The D-chip is the DRAM controller, implementing access to/from the CPUs, and to/from the P-chip. The 21272 could have two or four D-chips and the 21274 could have two, four, or eight D-chips. The 21272 and 21274 were used extensively by Digital, Compaq and Hewlett Packard in their entry-level to mid-range AlphaServers and in all models of the AlphaStation. It was also used in third-party products from Alpha Processor, Inc. (later known as API NetWorks) such as their UP2000+ motherboard. = Irongate = AMD developed two Alpha 21264-compatible chipsets, the Irongate, also known as the AMD-751, and its successor, Irongate-2, also known as the AMD-761. These chipsets were developed for their Athlon microprocessors but due to AMD licensing the EV6 bus used in the Alpha from Digital, the Athlon and Alpha 21264 were compatible in terms of bus protocol. The Irongate was used by Samsung in their UP1000 and UP1100 motherboards. The Irongate-2 was used by Samsung in their UP1500 motherboard.

History  The Alpha 21364 was revealed in October 1998 by Compaq at the 11th Annual Microprocessor Forum, where it was described as an Alpha 21264 with a 1.5 MB 6-way set-associative on-die secondary cache, an integrated Direct Rambus DRAM memory controller and an integrated network controller for connecting to other microprocessors. Changes to the Alpha 21264 core included a larger victim buffer, which was quadrupled in capacity to 32 entries, 16 for the Dcache and 16 for the Scache. It was reported by the Microprocessor Report that Compaq considered implementing minor changes to branch predictor to improve branch prediction accuracy and doubling the miss buffer in capacity to 16 entries instead of 8 in the Alpha 21264.\\"Alpha 21364 to Ease Memory Bottleneck\\", p. 2. It was expected to be taped-out in late 1999, with samples available in early 2000 and volume shipments in late 2000. However, the original schedule was delayed, with the tape-out in April 2001 instead of late 1999.\\"Alpha 21364 (EV7)\\", p. 2. The Alpha 21364 was introduced on 20 January 2002 when systems using the microprocessor debuted. It operated at 1.25 GHz, but production models in the AlphaServer ES47, ES80 and GS1280 operated at 1.0 GHz or 1.15 GHz. Unlike previous Alpha microprocessors, the Alpha 21364 was not sold on the open market. The Alpha 21364 was originally intended to be succeeded by the Alpha 21464, code-named EV8, a new implementation of the Alpha ISA with four-way simultaneous multithreading (SMT).\\"Compaq Chooses SMT for Alpha\\" It was first presented in October 1999 at the 12th Annual Microprocessor Forum, but was cancelled on 25 June 2001 at a late stage of development.\\"Design Tradeoffs for the Alpha EV8 Conditional Branch Predictor\\", p. 1. = Development = The development of the Alpha 21364 was most focused on features that would improve memory performance and multiprocessor scalability. The focus on memory performance was the result of a forward- looking article published in Microprocessor Report titled, \\"It's the Memory, Stupid!\\" written by Richard L. Sites, who co-led the definition of the Alpha architecture. The article concluded that, \\"Over the coming decade, memory subsystem design will be the only important design issue for microprocessors.\\"  Description  The Alpha 21364 was an Alpha 21264 with a 1.75 MB on-die secondary cache, two integrated memory controllers and an integrated network controller. = Core = The Alpha 21364's core is based on the EV68CB, a derivative of the Alpha 21264. The only modification was a larger victim buffer, now quadrupled in capacity to 32 entries. The 32 entries of victim buffer is divided equally into 16 entries each for the Dcache and Scache. Although the Alpha 21364 is a fourth-generation implementation of the Alpha Architecture, aside from this modification, the core is otherwise identical to the EV68CB derivative of the Alpha 21264.Compiler Writer‚Äôs Guide for the 21264/21364, p. 1-4. = Scache = The secondary cache (termed \\"Scache\\") is a unified cache with a capacity of 1.75 MB. It is 7-way set associative, uses a 64-byte line size, and has a write-back policy. The cache is protected by single-bit error correction, double-bit error detection (SECDED) error- correcting code (ECC). It is connected to the cache controller by a 128-bit data path. Access to the cache is fully pipelined, yielding a sustainable bandwidth of 16 GB/s at 1.0 GHz. The time required for data requested from the cache to when it can be used is 12 cycles.Compiler Writer‚Äôs Guide for the 21264/21364, p. 1-5 The 12-cycle latency was considered by observers, such as the Microprocessor Report, to be significant. The latency of the Scache was not reduced further as it would have not improved performance. The Alpha 21264 core upon which the Alpha 21364 was based on was designed to use an external cache built from commodity SRAM, which has a significantly higher latency than the on-die Scache of the Alpha 21364. Thus, it could only accept data at a limited rate. Once improving latency saw no further gains, the designers focused on reducing the power consumed by the Scache.\\"Power and CAD considerations for the 1.75Mbyte, 1.2GHz L2 cache on the Alpha 21364 CPU\\" Compaq was not willing to remedy this deficiency as it would have required the Alpha 21264 core to be modified significantly.\\"Alpha 21364 to Ease Memory Bottleneck\\", p. 3. The high latency of the Scache permitted the cache tags be looked up first to determine if the Scache contained the requested data and in which bank it was located in before powering up the Scache bank and accessing it. This avoided unproductive Scache accesses, reducing power consumption. The tag store consisted of 5.75 million transistors and data store of 108 million transistors. = Memory controller = The Alpha 21364 has two integrated memory controllers that support Rambus DRAM (RDRAM) that operate at two thirds of the microprocessor's clock frequency, or 800 MHz at 1.2 GHz. Compaq designed custom memory controllers for the Alpha 21364, giving them capabilities not found in standard RDRAM memory controllers such as having all the 128 pages open, reducing the access latency to those pages; and proprietary fault-tolerant features. Each memory controller provides five RDRAM channels that support PC800 Rambus inline memory modules (RIMMs). Four of the channels are used to provide memory, while the fifth is used to provide RAID-like redundancy. Each channel is 16 bits wide, operates at 400 MHz and transfers data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal (double data rate) for a transfer rate of 800 MT/s, yielding 1.6 GB/s of bandwidth. The total memory bandwidth of the eight channels is 12.8 GB/s. Cache coherence is provided by the memory controllers. Each memory controller has a cache coherence engine. The Alpha 21364 uses a directory cache coherence scheme where part of the memory is used to store Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid (MESI) coherency data. = R-box = The R-box contains the network router. The network router connected the microprocessor to other microprocessors using four ports named North, South, East and West. Each port consisted of two 39-bit unidirectional links operating at 800 MHz. 32 bits were for data and 7 bits were for ECC. The network router also has a fifth port, used for I/O. This port connects to an IO7 application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), which was a bridge to an AGP 4x channel and two PCI-X buses. The I/O port consisted of two unidirectional 32-bit links operating at 200 MHz, yielding a peak bandwidth of 3.2 GB/s. The I/O port link operated at a quarter of the clock frequency to simplify the design of the I/O ASIC. The Alpha 21364 can connect to as many as 127 other microprocessors using two network topologies: shuffle and an 2D torus. The shuffle topology had more direct paths to other microprocessors, reducing latency and therefore improving performance, but was limited to connecting up to eight microprocessors as a result of its nature. The 2D torus topology enabled the network to feature up to 128 microprocessors. In multiprocessing systems, each microprocessor is a node with its own memory. Accessing the memory of other nodes is possible, but with a latency. The latency increases with distance, thus the Alpha 21364 implements non-uniform memory access (NUMA) multiprocessing. I/O is also distributed in an identical fashion. An Alpha 21364 microprocessor in a multiprocessing system did not have to have its RIMM slots populated with memory or its I/O port populated with devices. It could use another microprocessor's memory and I/O. = Fault tolerance = The Alpha 21364 could operate in lock-step for fault-tolerant computers.\\"Alpha 21364 (EV7)\\" This feature was a result in Compaq's decision to migrate Tandem's Himalaya fault-tolerant servers from the MIPS architecture to Alpha. The machines however never used the microprocessor as the decision to phase out the Alpha in favor of the Itanium was made before the availability of the Alpha 21364. = Fabrication = The Alpha 21364 contained 152 million transistors. The die measured 21.1 mm by 18.8 mm for an area of 397 mm¬≤. It was fabricated by International Business Machines (IBM) in their 0.18 ¬µm, seven-level copper complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process. It was packaged in a 1,443-land flip-chip land grid array (LGA). It used a 1.65 V power supply and a 1.5 V external interface for a maximum power dissipation of 155 W at 1.25 GHz.  Alpha 21364A  The Alpha 21364A, code-named EV79, previously EV78, was a further development of the Alpha 21364. It was intended to be the last Alpha microprocessor developed. Scheduled to be introduced in 2004, it was cancelled on 23 October 2003, with HP cited performance and schedule issues as reasons. A replacement, the EV7z was announced on the same day. A prototype of the microprocessor was presented by Hewlett-Packard at the International Solid State Circuits Conference in February 2003. It operated at 1.45 GHz, had a die area of 251 mm¬≤, used a 1.2 V power supply, and dissipated 100 W (estimated).\\"Moore, Moore, and More at ISSCC\\", p. 3. The Alpha 21364A was to have improved upon the Alpha 21364 by featuring higher clock frequencies in the range of ~1.6 to ~1.7 GHz and support for 1066 Mbit/s RDRAM memory. It was to be fabricated by IBM in their 0.13 ¬µm silicon on insulator (SOI) process. As a result of the more advanced process, there were reductions in die size, power supply voltage (1.2 V compared to 1.65 V), and in power consumption and dissipation.  EV7z  The EV7z was a further development of the Alpha 21364. It was the last Alpha microprocessor developed and introduced. The EV7z became known on 23 October 2003 when HP announced they had cancelled the Alpha 21364A and would be replacing it with the EV7z.\\"HP is Dealt a Delay in its HP-UX OS and Alpha Processor Roadmap\\" The EV7z was introduced on 16 August 2004 when the only computer using the microprocessor, AlphaServer GS1280, was introduced. It was discontinued on 27 April 2007 when the computer it was featured in was discontinued. It operated at 1.3 GHz, supported PC1066 RIMMs and was fabricated in the same 0.18 ¬µm process as the Alpha 21364. Compared to the Alpha 21364, the EV7z was 14 to 16 percent faster, but was still slower than the Alpha 21364A it replaced, which was estimated to outperform the Alpha 21364 by 25 percent at 1.5 GHz.

She is often referred to in Chinese sources as Guo Anna (), the way Guo Moruo called her.Yan Lu. Re-understanding Japan: Chinese Perspectives, 1895‚Äì1945. University of Hawaii Press, 2004. Partial text on Google Books Sat≈ç Tomiko spent about 20 years with Guo, in Japan and in China, until they were separated by the war, and they had five children together. Biography Tomiko Sat≈ç was the eldest of eight children in the family of a Japanese Protestant minister in the Ohira village, Kurokawa District, Miyagi Prefecture (north-eastern Honsh≈´). In her teens she studied at a Baptist boarding school in Sendai, the capital of the prefecture. At 21, rebelling against the prospect of an arranged marriage, she left her home prefecture and went to Tokyo, where she found a job with St Luke's Hospital as a student nurse. Sat≈ç's relationship with Guo Moruo started in the summer of 1916, about a year after her arrival to Tokyo. A friend of Guo, named Chen Longji (ÈôàÈæôÈ™•),Ê•ö‰∏ò (Chu Qiu), ÈÉ≠Ê≤´Ëã•ÁöÑ‚ÄúÂ•≥Á•û‚Äù‰ª¨ (Guo Moruo's \\"Goddesses\\") happened to be treated for tuberculosis at St Luke's Hospital. Guo, who had just completed his first year of study in Japan, visited his sick friend in the hospital on his trip to Tokyo, but the patient died soon. After the death of his friend, Guo met her when visiting the hospital to request the dead friend's X-ray records. Sat≈ç was sharing Guo's grief over the death of his friend, and once Guo returned to Okayama, they started regularly exchange letters. By December, Guo Moruo convinced Sat≈ç to leave Tokyo and join him in Okayama.Chen Xiaoming, From the May Fourth Movement to Communist Revolution. SUNY Press, 2007. . Partial text on Google Books Pages 16‚Äì17 Sat≈ç and Guo had their first child, a son, in December 1917. Sat≈ç and Guo's union was vehemently opposed by both of their families, and ill-received by the community they were in. In April 1923, Sat≈ç moved with Guo and their three children to Shanghai. They had financial difficulties, and in February 1924 she went to Japan, taking the children along, but returned to Shanghai in mid-November. Guo was very active in the Communist underground movement. The Nationalist Government put out an arrest warrant for Guo in 1928. He escaped to Japan again and lived with Sato for 10 years. But they were under constant Japanese surveillance. = War Years = After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in July 1937, the war between China and Japan started in earnest. On July 25, Guo managed to escape Japan and to return to China where his arrest warrant was rescinded. As his attempts to get Sato and their children out of Japan later that year were frustrated by the Japanese government, she was left alone to take care of the children in wartime Japan. She had little money and lived a marginal life with the children. She resisted the pressure of the authorities to have them naturalized as Japanese citizens; this protected them from the prospect of being conscripted and possibly sent to fight against their father's country. The four elder children were able to enter Kyoto Imperial University; all graduated, and became specialists in industrial chemistry, aquaculture, architecture, and mathematics. The youngest child was educated at Qinghua University in Beijing. = Post War Years = After WWII she tried to contact Guo. He avoided all attempts to meet. She discovered that he took another wife and had several more children. She wrote long letters to his close friends whom she knew from their earlier years. In 1949 Chou En-Lai arranged for her to live in Dalian, China. She became a Chinese citizen. In 1983 she was appointed to the Sixth CPPCC National Committee and served consecutively thereafter.

For a general approach to nuclear safety, see nuclear safety. The three primary objectives of nuclear reactor safety systems as defined by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission are to shut down the reactor, maintain it in a shutdown condition and prevent the release of radioactive material. Reactor protection system (RPS) A reactor protection system is designed to immediately terminate the nuclear reaction. By breaking the nuclear chain reaction, the source of heat is eliminated. Other systems can then be used to remove decay heat from the core. All nuclear plants have some form of reactor protection system. =Control rods= Control rods are a series of rods that can be quickly inserted into the reactor core to absorb neutrons and rapidly terminate the nuclear reaction. They are typically composed of actinides, lanthanides, transition metals, and boron, in various alloys with structural backing such as steel. In addition to being neutron absorbent, the alloys used also are required to have at least a low coefficient of thermal expansion so that they do not jam under high temperatures, and they have to be self-lubricating metal on metal, because at the temperatures experienced by nuclear reactor cores oil lubrication would foul too quickly. =Safety injection / standby liquid control= Boiling water reactors are able to SCRAM the reactor completely with the help of their control rods. In the case of a Loss of coolant accident (LOCA), the water-loss of the primary cooling system can be compensated with normal water pumped into the cooling circuit. On the other hand, the standby liquid control system (SLC) consists of a solution containing boric acid, which acts as a neutron poison and rapidly floods the core in case of problems with the stopping of the chain reaction. Pressurized water reactors also can SCRAM the reactor completely with the help of their control rods. PWRs also use boric acid to make fine adjustments to reactor power level, or reactivity, using their Chemical and Volume Control System (CVCS). In the case of LOCA, PWRs have three sources of backup cooling water, high pressure injection (HPI), low pressure injection (LPI), and core flood tanks (CFTs). They all use water with a high concentration of boron. Essential service water system Cooling tower at the Philippsburg Nuclear Power Plant, Germany The essential service water system (ESWS) circulates the water that cools the plant's heat exchangers and other components before dissipating the heat into the environment. Because this includes cooling the systems that remove decay heat from both the primary system and the spent fuel rod cooling ponds, the ESWS is a safety-critical system.Pre-construction safety report - Sub-chapter 9.2 ‚Äì Water Systems AREVA NP / EDF, published 2009-06-29, accessed 2011-03-23 Since the water is frequently drawn from an adjacent river, the sea, or other large body of water, the system can be fouled by seaweed, marine organisms, oil pollution, ice and debris.Got Water? Union of Concerned Scientists, published October 2007, accessed 2011-03-23 In locations without a large body of water in which to dissipate the heat, water is recirculated via a cooling tower. The failure of half of the ESWS pumps was one of the factors that endangered safety in the 1999 Blayais Nuclear Power Plant flood,Generic Results and Conclusions of Re-evaluating the Flooding in French and German Nuclear Power Plants J.

Emergency core cooling systems HPCI and LPCI as a part of active ECCS Emergency core cooling systems (ECCS) are designed to safely shut down a nuclear reactor during accident conditions. The ECCS allows the plant to respond to a variety of accident conditions (e.g. LOCAs) and additionally introduce redundancy so that the plant can be shut down even with one or more subsystem failures. In most plants, ECCS is composed of the following systems: =High pressure coolant injection system= The High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) System consists of a pump or pumps that have sufficient pressure to inject coolant into the reactor vessel while it is pressurized. It is designed to monitor the level of coolant in the reactor vessel and automatically inject coolant when the level drops below a threshold. This system is normally the first line of defense for a reactor since it can be used while the reactor vessel is still highly pressurized. =Automatic depressurization system= Passive ECCS The Automatic Depressurization System (ADS) consists of a series of valves which open to vent steam several feet under the surface of a large pool of liquid water (known as the wetwell or torus) in pressure suppression type containments (typically used in boiling water reactor designs), or directly into the primary containment structure in other types of containments, such as large-dry or ice-condenser containments (typically used in pressurized water reactor designs). The actuation of these valves depressurizes the reactor vessel and allows lower pressure coolant injection systems to function, which have very large capacities in comparison to the high pressure systems. Some depressurization systems are automatic in function, while others may require operators to manually activate them. In pressurized water reactors with large dry or ice condenser containments, the valves of the system are called Pilot operated release valves. =Low pressure coolant injection system= LPCI consists of a pump or pumps that inject coolant into the reactor vessel once it has been depressurized. In some nuclear power plants, LPCI is a mode of operation of a residual heat removal system (RHR or RHS). LPCI is generally not a stand-alone system. =Core spray system (only in BWRs)= This system uses spargers (pipes fitted with an array of many small spray nozzles) within the reactor pressure vessel to spray water directly onto the fuel rods, suppressing the generation of steam. Reactor designs can include core spray in high-pressure and low-pressure modes. =Containment spray system= This system consists of a series of pumps and spargers that spray coolant into the upper portion of the primary containment structure. It is designed to condense the steam into liquid within the primary containment structure in order to prevent overpressure and overtemperature, which could lead to leakage, followed by involuntary depressurization. =Isolation cooling system= This system is often driven by a steam turbine to provide enough water to safely cool the reactor if the reactor building is isolated from the control and turbine buildings. Steam turbine driven cooling pumps with pneumatic controls can run at mechanically controlled adjustable speeds, without battery power, emergency generator, or off-site electrical power. The Isolation cooling system is a defensive system against a condition known as station blackout. This system is not part of the ECCS and does not have a low coolant accident function. For pressurized water reactors, this system acts in the secondary cooling circuit and is called Turbine driven auxiliary feedwater system. Emergency electrical systems Under normal conditions, nuclear power plants receive power from generator. However, during an accident a plant may lose access to this power supply and thus may be required to generate its own power to supply its emergency systems. These electrical systems usually consist of diesel generators and batteries. =Diesel generators= Diesel generators are employed to power the site during emergency situations. They are usually sized such that a single one can provide all the required power for a facility to shut down during an emergency. Facilities have multiple generators for redundancy. Additionally, systems that are required to shut down the reactor have separate electrical sources (often separate generators) so that they do not affect shutdown capability. =Motor generator flywheels= Loss of electrical power can occur suddenly and can damage or undermine equipment. To prevent damage, motor-generators can be tied to flywheels that can provide uninterrupted electrical power to equipment for a brief period. Often they are used to provide electrical power until the plant electrical supply can be switched to the batteries and/or diesel generators. =Batteries= Batteries often form the final redundant backup electrical system and are also capable of providing sufficient electrical power to shut down a plant. Containment systems Containment systems are designed to prevent the release of radioactive material into the environment. =Fuel cladding= The fuel cladding is the first layer of protection around the nuclear fuel and is designed to protect the fuel from corrosion that would spread fuel material throughout the reactor coolant circuit. In most reactors it takes the form of a sealed metallic or ceramic layer. It also serves to trap fission products, especially those that are gaseous at the reactor's operating temperature, such as krypton, xenon and iodine. Cladding does not constitute shielding, and must be developed such that it absorbs as little radiation as possible. For this reason, materials such as magnesium and zirconium are used for their low neutron capture cross sections. =Reactor vessel= The reactor vessel is the first layer of shielding around the nuclear fuel and usually is designed to trap most of the radiation released during a nuclear reaction. The reactor vessel is also designed to withstand high pressures. =Primary containment= The primary containment system usually consists of a large metal and/or concrete structure (often cylindrical or bulb shaped) that contains the reactor vessel. In most reactors it also contains the radioactively contaminated systems. The primary containment system is designed to withstand strong internal pressures resulting from a leak or intentional depressurization of the reactor vessel. =Secondary containment= Some plants have a secondary containment system that encompasses the primary system. This is very common in BWRs because most of the steam systems, including the turbine, contain radioactive materials. =Core catching= In case of a full melt-down, the fuel would most likely end up on the concrete floor of the primary containment building. Concrete can withstand a great deal of heat, so the thick flat concrete floor in the primary containment will often be sufficient protection against the so-called China Syndrome. The Chernobyl plant didn't have a containment building, but the core was eventually stopped by the concrete foundation. Due to concerns that the core would melt its way through the concrete, a \\"core catching device\\" was invented, and a mine was quickly dug under the plant with the intention to install such a device. The device contains a quantity of metal designed to melt, diluting the corium and increasing its heat conductivity; the diluted metallic mass could then be cooled by water circulating in the floor. Today, all new Russian-designed reactors are equipped with core-catchers in the bottom of the containment building.Nuclear Industry in Russia Sells Safety, Taught by Chernobyl The AREVA EPR, SNR-300, SWR1000, ESBWR, and Atmea I reactors have core catchers. Standby gas treatment A standby gas treatment system (SGTS) is part of the secondary containment system. The SGTS system filters and pumps air from secondary containment to the environment and maintains a negative pressure within the secondary containment to limit the release of radioactive material. Each SGTS train generally consists of a mist eliminator/roughing filter; an electric heater; a prefilter; two absolute (HEPA) filters; an activated charcoal filter; an exhaust fan; and associated valves, ductwork, dampers, instrumentation and controls. The signals that trip the SGTS system are plant-specific; however, automatic trips are generally associated with the electric heaters and a high temperature condition in the charcoal filters. Ventilation and radiation protection In case of a radioactive release, most plants have a system designed to remove radioactivity from the air to reduce the effects of the radioactivity release on the employees and public. This system usually consists of containment ventilation that removes radioactivity and steam from primary containment. Control room ventilation ensures that plant operators are protected. This system often consists of activated charcoal filters that remove radioactive isotopes from the air.

The season was produced by Warner Bros. Television, Silver Pictures Television, Stu Segall Productions, Inc and Rob Thomas Productions, and Joel Silver, Diane Ruggiero and Thomas served as executive producers. The third season comprises 20 episodes and concluded its initial airing on May 22, 2007. The season continues the story of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell), now a freshman studying at Hearst College while moonlighting as a private investigator under the wing of her detective father. The first mystery is established when her friend Parker Lee (Julie Gonzalo) becomes the latest victim of the Hearst serial rapist in a storyline begun in a second-season episode. Feeling guilty for not helping her, Veronica sets herself to catching the rapist. The next mystery, a murder, commences in the same episode that the identity of the rapist is discovered. To increase viewership, the third season format was changed to include two separate mysteries that would be introduced and resolved in a series of non-overlapping story arcs. Three of the regulars in the second season were written out of the series, two new characters were introduced and two others were upgraded from recurring roles. The third season received generally mixed critical reviews compared to previous seasons. Cast The third season features a cast of ten actors who receive billing, an increase from the nine actors in the second. Kristen Bell portrays the titular Veronica Mars, a college student and skilled private detective. Jason Dohring plays Logan Echolls, Veronica's love interest. Ryan Hansen plays Logan's obnoxious friend Dick Casablancas. Percy Daggs III portrays Wallace Fennel, Veronica's best friend and frequent partner in solving mysteries. Francis Capra portrays Eli \\"Weevil\\" Navarro, the previous leader of the Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) biker gang and Veronica's friend. Enrico Colantoni plays Veronica's father Keith Mars, a private investigator and former Balboa County Sheriff. Cindy \\"Mac\\" Mackenzie and Don Lamb, recurring characters in the first two seasons, were upgraded to series regulars in the third. Mac, portrayed by Tina Majorino, was a computer expert befriended by Veronica. Lamb, portrayed by Michael Muhney, was the Balboa County Sheriff who won the office from Keith in the recall election. The third season introduces two new series regulars, Julie Gonzalo portrays Parker Lee and Chris Lowell plays Stosh \\"Piz\\" Piznarski. Piz, named after the director of the pilot, Mark Piznarski, was created so that Veronica could have a male friend of middle- class status rather than of upper-class. He is Wallace's roommate and a friend of Veronica, and his campus radio show serves as a narrative device to capture the mood of the university. Parker is Mac's extroverted roommate at Hearst College and \\"everything that [she] is not\\", according to Thomas. Regular characters who did not return for the third season were Duncan Kane (played by Teddy Dunn), who left the country with his daughter midway through the second season, Jackie Cook (Tessa Thompson), who returned to New York, and Cassidy Casablancas (Kyle Gallner), who died by suicide in the season two finale. Release =Critical reception= Reviews of the third season were mixed compared to the previous two seasons. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune praised Bell's performance, who she said deserved the \\"truckload of glowing press notices for her work as the tightly wound, emotionally resilient young detective\\". Ryan thought Veronica's relationship with Keith was \\"one of the best, if not the best, parent-child relationship on television\\", and described Logan and Veronica's on-screen chemistry as \\"sizzling\\". Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com felt that although the third season \\"wasn't the strongest\\", it did show that Veronica Mars \\"could not only survive but continue to find ways to reinvigorate itself\\". Zacharek liked newcomer Piz, and realized how much she was going to miss the character Dick. Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post- Intelligencer felt that Veronica Mars \\"easily has a few more seasons left in it\\", and described the writing as \\"unfailingly hysterical and clever\\". McFarland praised the cast as \\"without a doubt one of the most likable on television\\", and called Dohring \\"the most beloved of the bunch\\". Keith McDuffee of TV Squad deemed the season \\"disappointing\\", mainly because the episodes offered nothing new: \\"most fans of Veronica Mars felt that season three was clearly its weakest\\". Eric Goldman of IGN said that the main issue was the shift in the overall tone, with a lighter feeling than the previous seasons. Goldman believed that Logan had been most affected by the tone change; he was robbed of his darker aspects and changed into an \\"increasingly extraneous character\\". The reviewer felt that despite the concerns over the final five episodes, the series ended with \\"three very strong episodes, with lots of strong dialogue\\". Goldman concluded that although third season \\"was very choppy\\", it still had \\"plenty of witty dialogue and a continually engaging performance by Kristen Bell as the title character\\". The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette opined that Veronica Mars had taken a dive \\"creatively\\", from \\"the mopier version of its theme song to stalled storylines\\". The reviewer felt that \\"the arcing mysteries had grown less convincing and compelling as time went on and were too drawn out\\". Fox News Channel's Bridget Byrne pointed out that Veronica had \\"gone from punky to‚Äîdare we say‚Äîpreppy\\" in the third season. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 89% with an average score of 8.13/10, based on 18 reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"The third season of Veronica Mars continues to highlight the show's simple brilliance, offering more of the witty banter and quote-worthy dialogue the series is known for.\\" =Ratings and awards= The third-season premiere was watched by 3.36 million American viewers, an increase from the 2.42 million viewers who viewed the second- season finale. Ratings remained stable for the first ten episodes, and the ninth episode featured the most viewers of the season with 3.44 million. Beginning with the eleventh episode, ratings dropped to a consistent viewership of a mid-2 million per episode, and the final episode before the hiatus was watched by 2.66 million viewers. When the series returned from its hiatus, viewers had decreased to 2.35 million, and the final two episodes garnered only 1.78 and 2.15 million viewers respectively. The third season averaged 2.5 million viewers for all 20 episodes. Out of all regular primetime programming that aired during the 2006‚Äì2007 American television season, Veronica Mars ranked 138th out of 142, according to the Nielsen ratings system. The third season was nominated for two awards: Kristen Bell was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television, and the series was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for On-Air Promotion (Radio or Television). =Distribution= A bar graph of the US ratings for the third season. The first two seasons of Veronica Mars aired on UPN; however, in 2006, CBS Corporation and Warner Bros. decided to merge UPN and The WB into The CW. Paul Maguire, the spokesman for The CW, said that the series was picked up because \\"the critics are behind it and our research has consistently shown that Gilmore shared more audience commonality with Veronica than with any other show from UPN, except Top Model\\". The third season was released in the US under the title Veronica Mars: The Complete Third Season as a widescreen six-disc Region 1 DVD box set on October 23, 2007, Region 2 on December 12, 2008, and Region 4 on February 11, 2009. In addition to all of the aired episodes, DVD extras included unaired scenes with introductions by Rob Thomas, a gag reel, and a webisode gallery with cast interviews and various set tours. Also included were the featurettes, \\"Going Undercover with Rob Thomas\\" commentary and \\"Pitching Season 4\\", an interview with Thomas discussing a new direction for the series that picks up years later, with Veronica as a rookie FBI agent. The third season was simulcast in Canada by Fox 44. The series had previously been broadcast in Canada by the CTV Television Network and Sun TV. Despite airing the series to low ratings in the previous seasons, the United Kingdom's Living decided to air the series' third season. Network Ten began airing the third season in Australia on March 30, 2007. The series went on hiatus after the fourth episode on April 20, 2007, and resumed on the newly created Ten HD in 2008. The finale was aired on April 8, 2008. The third season was broadcast in New Zealand by TV2. Cancellation and future At the 2007 CW Upfront, Ostroff announced that Veronica Mars was not part of the new primetime lineup and was \\"not coming back\\". When asked if the series could continue with the FBI concept, Ostroff said that the series was completely gone \\"in any form\\". Upon the cancellation of the series, a group of fans calling themselves the \\"Cloud Watchers\\" sent more than 10,000 Mars bars to the CW, hoping that the network would reverse its decision and renew the series. Thomas stated that he was interested in writing a feature film based on the series, in the interest of providing closure to the storylines and character arcs. In September 2008, Thomas told Entertainment Weekly that \\"I thought I had the idea broken, but I've hit a wall in the final act that I haven't quite figured out\\". Thomas explained that he was very busy writing for Cupid and Party Down, both of which he created. In January 2009, TV Guide reported that the film was Thomas' first priority after Cupid. Thomas noted that as well as writing the script, someone would need to pay for the film, but indicated that producer Joel Silver was ready to green-light the film. In late March, Thomas stated that although the film was not green-lit by the studio, the possibility was still there. Thomas revealed that the film would take place before Veronica's graduation, and feature Wallace, Logan, Mac and Weevil. A film continuation, released in early 2014, was confirmed after a successful Kickstarter campaign launched by Rob Thomas which raised over $5.7 million. In September 2018, an eight-episode fourth season was confirmed by Hulu, which was released on July 19, 2019. Episodes Veronica is still living at home with her father Keith, and Piz and Parker are introduced as the respective roommates of Veronica's friends Wallace and Mac. Weevil takes a job at Hearst as a maintenance man, while Lamb continues to serve as Sheriff. During the season, Keith begins an affair with a married client, Wallace struggles to balance academics and sports, Mac begins dating again after previous failed relationships, and Dick has a breakdown and appeals to Logan for help. The season chronicles Veronica and Logan's failing attempts to maintain their relationship in the face of Veronica's mistrust.

The organization works with landowners to protect important areas by restricting commercial or other development. This protection is provided either by the landowner accepting a conservation easement on the land or by selling the land to HILT. As of 2018, the organization protected more than 18,000 acres across the state. History In January 2011, HILT was formed from the merger of the Kauai Public Land Trust, the Oahu Land Trust, the Maui Coastal Land Trust, and the Hawaii Island Land Trust. The first executive director was Dale Bonar, followed by Ted Clement and then Kawika Burgess.  Services  In addition to its core function of conserving important lands for future generations, HILT provides educational services, research and opportunities for recreation. = Talk Story on the Land = HILT offers a series of educational walks on its properties across the state. = Recreation = HILT properties are generally open to the public for activities such as fishing, camping and hiking. = Research = HILT staff conducts research on Hawaii's unique anchialine ponds and on the culture that surrounds them.  Properties  HILT protects multiple properties on O'ahu, Kauai, Maui and Hawaii Island, totalling more than 17,000 acres. Protected lands include coastal areas, farms, ranchlands, cultural sites and more. =Waihee coastal dunes and wetlands refuge= The Waihee coastal dunes and wetlands refuge protects over 277 acres of land on Maui. the refuge includes of coastal, spring-fed wetland, of sand dune ecosystem, over of shoreline and more than of riparian habitat, totaling . It is located on the windward side of Maui, Hawaii. The Maui Coastal Land Trust took ownership of this site in 2004 with support from Maui County. The property passed to HILT with the merger. Active restoration programs have replaced invasive vegetation with native species, enhanced wildlife habitat and preserved archaeological and cultural resources. Restoration employs primarily volunteer labor, managed by professional staff. The refuge is an important historical site, once hosting kingly residences, battles and Hawaiian legends. The refuge once hosted two fishing Hawaiian villages, an extensive inland Hawaiian fish ponds and several heiau (Hawaiian temple). The refuge incorporates the last of Maui's large sand dunes that once stretched from Waihe'e to Makena, which once led to the island's nickname of \\"Sahara in the Pacific\\". The dunes are some high. Acquisition The purchase was funded by Maui County (which provided $2,000,000), the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) (which contributed a further $2 million) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (which provided $800,000). Management funding came from FWS, the National Resource Conservation Service Wetlands Reserve Program, NOAA, other grants and private funding from foundations, individuals and groups. Climate change Expected rising sea levels could inundate the sand dunes with seawater or transform them into sandy beaches. A rise is expected to submerge 50-60% of the refuge. Adaptations that would preserve environmental and cultural values have yet to be developed/discovered. It is possible that the return to pre-development ecological status will provide sufficient resilience to provide protection. Agriculture Restoration plans include restoration of the fishpond and production of historically farmed crops such as taro. Nine taro patches are undergoing restoration, occupying about . Some 200 sheep live in the refuge. Conservation Six endangered taxa, two endangered plants, and two endangered insects were found on the site. Eight endangered species have repopulated the refuge, including aeo (stilt), alae keokeo (coot), koloa (duck) and nene (goose). When the property was first protected, 95% of the plants were invasive species. As of 2014, 70% of the flora in the wetland are native species. Culture Many of the important cultural and archaeological sites are located in sand dunes at or near the water. The dunes contains multiple burial sites. The dunes were fenced off to reduce foot traffic and exclude invasive predators. Thereafter endangered bird species began to nest on the dunes, acting as a natural vector and fertilizer for native plants. = Nu'u = HILT purchased the 82-acre Nu'u Preserve in 2011. The preserve provides habitat for endangered bird species and is home to numerous pre-contact archaeological sites, including petroglyphs and traditional house sites. = Nisei Veterans Peace Park = In 2015 the Nisei Veterans Memorial Center donated a 4.5 acre parcel in Kahului to HILT, Maui and turned it into a memorial park to commemorate the service of the Nisei Veterans in World War II. = Maunawila Heiau = In 2015, HILT took ownership of Maunawila Heiau located on 9 acres in Hau'ula, Hawaii and began to restore it = Kahili Beach Park = In 2013, the Trust acquired a 12.2-acre parcel at Kahili beach in Kilauea.

House prices in Australia receive considerable attention from the media and the Reserve BankMonetary Policy and some commentators have argued that there is an Australian property bubble. The residential housing market has seen drastic changes in prices in the past few decades. The property prices are soaring in major cities like Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane and Hobart. The median house price in Sydney peaked to $780,000 in 2016. However, with stricter credit policy and reduced interest from foreign investors in residential property, prices have started falling in all the major cities. When compared with the soaring prices of 2017, the housing prices fell by 11.1% in Sydney and 7.2% in Melbourne in 2018.  Description  = Composition = In 2011 there were 8.6m households with an average household size of 2.6 persons per household. Freestanding houses have historically comprised most building approvals, but recent data shows a trend towards higher density housing such as townhouses and units.Apartments, townhouses continue to drive Australian building approvals Turnover rates vary across market cycles, but typically average 6% per year.

In the late 2000s, housing prices in Australia, relative to average incomes, were among the highest in the world. As at 2011, house prices were on average six times average household income, compared to four times in 1990. The facts on Australian housing affordability This prompted speculation that the country was experiencing a real estate bubble, like many other countries.Is There a Recession Brewing in Our Housing Bubble? Foreign investment has also been identified as a key driver of affordability issues, with recent years seeing particularly high capital inflows from Chinese investors.Wall of Chinese capital buying up Australian properties =Immigration to Australia= A number of economists, such as Macquarie Bank analyst Rory Robertson, assert that high immigration and the propensity of new arrivals to cluster in the capital cities is exacerbating the nation's housing affordability problem.Klan, A. (17 March 2007) Locked out According to Robertson, Federal Government policies that fuel demand for housing, such as the currently high levels of immigration, as well as capital gains tax discounts and subsidies to boost fertility, have had a greater impact on housing affordability than land release on urban fringes.Wade, M. (9 September 2006) PM told he's wrong on house prices The Productivity Commission Inquiry Report No. 28 First Home Ownership (2004) also stated, in relation to housing, \\"that Growth in immigration since the mid-1990s has been an important contributor to underlying demand, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne.\\" This has been exacerbated by Australian lenders relaxing credit guidelines for temporary residents, allowing them to buy a home with a 10 percent deposit. The RBA in its submission to the same PC Report also stated \\"rapid growth in overseas visitors such as students may have boosted demand for rental housing\\". However, in question in the report was the statistical coverage of resident population. The \\"ABS population growth figures omit certain household formation groups ‚Äì namely, overseas students and business migrants who do not continuously stay for 12 months in Australia.\\" This statistical omission lead to the admission: \\"The Commission recognises that the ABS resident population estimates have limitations when used for assessing housing demand. Given the significant influx of foreigners coming to work or study in Australia in recent years, it seems highly likely that short-stay visitor movements may have added to the demand for housing. However, the Commissions are unaware of any research that quantifies the effects.\\" Some individuals and interest groups have also argued that immigration causes overburdened infrastructure.Claus, E (2005) Submission to the Productivity Commission on Population and Migration (submission 12 to the Productivity Commission's position paper on Economic Impacts of Migration and Population Growth). Nilsson (2005) Negative Economic Impacts of Immigration and Population Growth (submission 9 to the Productivity Commission's position paper on Economic Impacts of Migration and Population Growth). =Foreign investment in residential property= In December 2008, the federal government introduced legislation relaxing rules for foreign buyers of Australian property. According to FIRB (Foreign Investment Review Board) data released in August 2009, foreign investment in Australian real estate had increased by more than 30% year to date. One agent said that \\"overseas investors buy them to land bank, not to rent them out. The houses just sit vacant because they are after capital growth.\\" = Negative gearing = Australian property investors often apply the practice of negative gearing. This occurs when the investor borrows money to fund the purchase of the property, and the income generated by the property is less than the cost of owning and managing the property including interest.Negative gearing and positive gearing The investor is expecting that capital gains will compensate for the shortfall. Negative gearing receives considerable media and political attention due to the perceived distortion it creates on residential property prices. In anticipation of labor being elected in the next federal election, the banks have been issuing less interest only loans which are primarily used for negative gearing.

The network's programming consists of classic television series from the 1950s to the early 2000s, most of which are sourced from the content library of Sony Pictures Entertainment, along with a selection of series from Universal Studios, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Carson Entertainment. Antenna TV's programming and advertising operations are headquartered in the Tribune Tower in Chicago, Illinois. The network's operations are overseen by Sean Compton, who serves as the president of strategic programming and acquisitions for Nexstar Media Group. The network is available in many media markets via the digital subchannels of over-the-air broadcast television stations, and on select cable television providers, such as Xfinity and Verizon Fios through a local affiliate of the network and IPTV. Antenna TV broadcasts 24 hours a day in 480i standard definition. It is a sister network to the movie-oriented multicast service This TV, in which Nexstar maintains a 50% ownership stake. History Original logo, used from January 1 to August 29, 2011. Tribune Broadcasting announced the formation of Antenna TV on August 30, 2010, with television stations owned by Tribune and Local TV (an Oak Hill Capital Partners-controlled holding company that Tribune had been co-managing since 2008, in an agreement that remained in place until Tribune completed its outright acquisition of the group in December 2013) serving as its initial charter affiliates; Tribune originally intended to launch the network on January 3, 2011, though executives later chose to push the date of its debut two days ahead of schedule. Antenna TV was launched on January 1, 2011, at 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time (the late evening of December 31, 2010, in other U.S. time zones), initially debuting on seventeen Tribune-owned stations and thirteen stations owned by Local TV. The first program to air on Antenna TV was the Three Stooges' first short Woman Haters as part of a marathon of short films involving the comedy trio (which became an annual New Year's Day tradition on the network that aired until 2015, originally airing as an all-day marathon before being reduced to airing only on New Year's Day morning in 2013). On October 1, 2011, Antenna TV introduced block scheduling for most of its programs, organized by genre and the decade of their original broadcast; it included a weekday afternoon block of sitcoms from the 1950s, a weekend afternoon block of 1960s sitcoms (including the early 1970s sitcom, The Partridge Family), a Saturday night lineup of drama series (a genre of television programs which had previously aired on the network in very limited form on Sunday mornings only), an overnight block of classic television series from the black-and-white era of the 1950s and early 1960s, a Sunday prime time lineup of sitcoms from the 1990s, and a weeknight prime time lineup of comedies from the 1970s; with the exception of the black-and-white program block (which was reduced to once a week and moved to Friday nights, where it remained ‚Äì except for a brief sabbatical from January to April 2013 ‚Äì until being dropped completely in November of that same year) and the Saturday night drama block (which was reduced to Saturday evenings only, and was later replaced by movies in September 2013), most of these blocks were dropped on March 26, 2012. By July 2016, Tribune was considering, with the network's success, adding a sister network, Antenna TV Classics, which would take shows that draw older audiences, in an arrangement that proposed refocusing Antenna TV around shows targeting younger audiences. Programming Antenna TV's program schedule relies on the extensive library of films and television programming currently owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment, which comprises more than 270 television series and over 4,000 films. The network maintains an Eastern Time schedule, with individual programs airing at the same time in the remainder of the country, though by effect, aired locally in earlier time slots from the Central Time Zone westward. As is common with digital multicast networks, advertisements featured during commercial breaks on Antenna TV primarily consist of direct response advertisements for products featured in infomercials and particularly during its Saturday morning children's programming, public service announcements; satellite provider Dish Network and insurance company Progressive are currently the network's primary national sponsors. Many Antenna TV affiliates also use the allotted advertising time to feature localized promotions, ranging from upcoming programming seen on that affiliate's other digital channels, to newspaper and vehicle dealership advertisements, to community service announcements. Initially, Antenna TV did not run a split-screen credit sequence at the conclusion of its programs. However, this policy changed in April 2015, when such a sequence (modeled in the style which many cable channels ‚Äì including sister network WGN America ‚Äì have used since the late 2000s, in which the show's normal credit sequence is downscaled to the left side of the screen as the opening teaser or title sequence of the next program ‚Äì which is identified in a graphic framing both ‚Äì starts simultaneously) began to be used on some programs aired in daytime slots, gradually expanding to other dayparts through that summer. Programs airing as part of Antenna TV's weeknight prime time schedule (from 7:00 to 11:00 p.m. Eastern) were not affected until September 2015, when a variant split-screen sequence that incorporated program and network image promotions was introduced during that daypart. Split-screen credits are not used during certain programs (such as Sabrina, the Teenage Witch and Wings) that feature multiple episodes containing tag scenes during the closing credits as well as certain shows with lyrical end credit themes (such as Welcome Back, Kotter and Maude). The network does not display an on-screen logo bug during its programs, but allows affiliates to incorporate their own bug during Antenna TV programming; many stations that follow this practice utilize modified versions of logos that the affiliate station has used as part of their main branding in the past (for example, WPHL-TV in Philadelphia uses a variant of the logo it used from 1976 to 1987, under the brand \\"Channel 17, The Great Entertainer\\"). The network's original continuity announcer was Gary Owens (disc jockey and voice actor of Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In fame), who served in that capacity until his death on February 12, 2015, although promos that he voiced beforehand continued to air until that September. John B. Wells (co-host of the syndicated radio program Coast to Coast AM and narrator of Unsealed Alien Files) also provided promotional continuity from November 2011 to July 2015. Shadoe Stevens (who notably served as announcer for the John Davidson- and Tom Bergeron-hosted runs of Hollywood Squares, and later The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson) became the network's main announcer in July 2015. Antenna TV also runs occasional marathons of series to which it holds rights through its content agreements on major occasions. Prior to \\"Antenna TV Theater\\"s discontinuation, the network also aired movie marathons on Valentine's Day, Memorial Day, Veterans Day (until 2013) and Super Bowl Sunday (until 2015) and racing day in 2016. Among the marathons regularly carried by the network are those of Hazel and Father Knows Best that have respectively aired on Mother's Day and Father's Day annually since 2011 (in the former case, the exceptions were in 2015 and 2016, when it aired marathons of One Day at a Time, Family Ties and Sanford and Son on those holidays); it also airs a 48-hour marathon of holiday-themed episodes of its various series from Christmas Eve until Christmas night, which is interrupted for four hours on Christmas morning by its broadcast of the Yule Log (a filmed loop of logs burning inside a fireplace at Gracie Mansion set to a soundtrack of Christmas music, which first aired on co-owned New York City affiliate WPIX in December 1966). Since the network began carrying most of the surviving episodes of the Johnny Carson run of The Tonight Show to its schedule in January 2016, many of these marathons have been followed by Tonight Show episodes featuring guests who starred in the featured marathon program. The acquisition also resulted in the network running fewer marathons that run into the late prime time and overnight hours (among the few exceptions was 2017's \\"All of All in the Family Marathon,\\" a five-day-long, Thanksgiving weekend stunt of all 205 All in the Family episodes [commemorating the show's then-pending departure from Antenna TV], which included Carson episodes featuring stars of the former as guests that aired in Carsons network-designated timeslots between the nighttime blocks of AITF episodes). The network also marks the occurrence of an actor's recent death (either an established or character) with an \\"in memoriam\\" bumper shown during breaks between certain programs, and an occasional afternoon-long marathon showcasing episodes of that artist's television series roles ‚Äì either guest appearances, episodes of series in which the person was a regular cast member, or both. Episodes of series on the network's regular schedule that would normally air next in broadcast order and are pre-empted by some of the marathons are usually skipped over entirely as a result and held over until the next broadcast cycle, with episodes next in order being shown instead on the next scheduled airdate (depending on whether the episode cycle is uniform on all days that the program is broadcast or airs in separate episode runs for their weekday and weekend airings). =Classic television series= Antenna TV has program licensing agreements with Sony Pictures Entertainment (which includes series produced by Columbia Pictures Television, TriStar Television and their merged production unit Columbia TriStar Television (which was reorganized as Sony Pictures Television in 2002), Screen Gems, and ELP Communications (including predecessors Tandem Productions, T.A.T. Communications and Embassy Communications), CBS Television Distribution, and DLT Entertainment. The network also shares broadcast rights to classic television programs from the NBCUniversal Television Distribution and Disney Media Distribution's 20th Television libraries with competing Weigel Broadcasting-owned digital broadcast network and primary rightsholder MeTV (with Antenna TV gaining access to Universal's program library in the fall of 2011, after those shows were removed from the Retro Television Network, and access to 20th Television's library via its April 2012 acquisition of WKRP in Cincinnati with other series from the library being added in January 2015) and rights to select program titles from Warner Bros. Television Distribution, and MGM Television (which includes series produced by Filmways and United Artists Television, but does not include content owned by its parent studio prior to the 1986 acquisition of films and television programs produced directly by MGM by Ted Turner) with Antenna TV sister network This TV. The network's series programming primarily covers sitcoms ‚Äì along with some select drama series ‚Äì from the 1950s to the early 2000s and () includes shows such as Murphy Brown; Newhart; Wings; My Two Dads; Family Ties; Sabrina, the Teenage Witch; Growing Pains; I Dream of Jeannie; Bewitched; The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show; Mr. Belvedere; Head of the Class; Mork & Mindy; The Hogan Family; and Silver Spoons. While several series on the network have been widely syndicated on other television outlets in the United States and abroad, some series featured on the network (such as Hazel, Evening Shade, Soap, Doogie Howser, M.D. and Small Wonder) have not been seen on television ‚Äì at least, in the U.S. ‚Äì for several years or have been syndicated on a fairly inconsistent basis, and a few (such as The Paul Lynde Show and Lotsa Luck) were too short-lived to have ever had a syndication afterlife. Drama series, which occupied a limited amount of the network's schedule for the first few months on the air, later expanded with an October 2011 programming realignment, with crime drama, mystery and suspense programs airing in an evening block on Saturdays, which included It Takes a Thief, Adam-12, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, S.W.A.T. and Suspense Theater; some of these programs are also aired during the week in limited form during the late afternoon and overnight hours. The Saturday drama block was discontinued in September 2012, with drama series on Saturdays being moved to the late afternoon hours and movies replacing them in prime time on that night. Drama series are now only seen on Saturday morning as of January 2017. In a rarity for television, Antenna TV has rotated a television series and its spinoffs on its schedule in the same hour, airing the shorter-lived spinoffs of Three's Company (The Ropers and Three's a Crowd) with the parent show being relegated to the first half-hour of the hour-long block (differing from the network's normal double-episode scheduling for its series) once they cycle back onto the schedule (the cycling of The Ropers and Three's a Crowd ended with a January 2015 programming realignment that saw both series given their own separate weekend-only runs on the network). This discontinued when the Three's Company spinoffs were replaced with Saturday Summerthons. After losing the rights to All in the Family (now on GetTV) in 2018, Antenna TV acquired rights to the sequel series Archie Bunker's Place, which currently fills the featured prime time slot. On August 12, 2015, Tribune Broadcasting announced that it had acquired the rights to all surviving episodes of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson through a multi-year agreement with Carson Entertainment Group, marking the first time that full episodes from that era of The Tonight Show would be shown on television (outside of excerpts aired as part of the clip series Carson's Comedy Classics) since his retirement in May 1992. The broadcasts ‚Äì which began airing on January 1, 2016 under the network-substituted title Johnny Carson, as NBC holds ownership of The Tonight Show title and the episodes air (depending on the quarterly schedule, partially or wholly) opposite the current edition of Tonight in much of the United States ‚Äì consist of episodes that originally aired from 1972 to 1992; episodes produced after September 1980 that ran 60 minutes in length (per a clause in Carson's renegotiated contract with NBC that reduced the running time of Tonight by a half-hour) air weeknights, while 90-minute episodes produced before September 1980 air on weekends. =Movies= From the network's launch in January 2011 until May 2016, Antenna TV aired feature films under the umbrella title Antenna TV Theater. In addition to access to television series owned by Sony Pictures Television, the agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment also included access to movies from the Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group film library (including Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures, Sony Pictures Classics, Screen Gems, Triumph Films, and the television rights to the Embassy Pictures library). The film roster did not concentrate on films from any specific era, meaning any film from the 1930s to as late as the early 2000s could be featured on the network's schedule, although from 2014 to 2015, the vast majority of the films that aired on the network were pre-1980s releases. During 2014, the network shared film content with sister network This TV (a movie-oriented broadcast network, whose transfer of operational control and partial ownership to Tribune from Weigel Broadcasting in November 2013 has partly influenced Antenna TV's removal of films); on certain occasions, a movie that aired on Antenna TV's film block would air on This TV on the same day or during the same week in different timeslots. Starting in April 2013, Antenna TV gradually scaled back its film telecasts in favor of additional blocks of classic television series (particularly on weekday mornings, where Antenna TV Theater originally ran as a six-hour block from approximately 5:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time at the network's launch). Movies were eliminated from weekdays entirely as part of a schedule revamp in January 2015; the Antenna TV Theater block ‚Äì which by that point, had been relegated to Saturday and Sunday mornings ‚Äì ended on December 27, 2015, preceding a similar revamp that occurred six days later on January 1, 2016. Movies returned to the lineup in May 2016 as part of a marathon on racing films. =Children's programming= Antenna TV provides four hours of programming aimed at children on Saturday mornings (originally three hours until September 2015), consisting of shows originally distributed for syndication by Bellum Entertainment Group which complies with weekly requirements for educational children's programming defined in the Federal Communications Commission's Children's Television Act. On August 26, 2017, the network began to carry a block of older Litton Entertainment programming airing on Saturday mornings, replacing the former Bellum block. Affiliates , Antenna TV has current or pending affiliation agreements with television stations in 133 media markets (including 48 of the 50 largest markets) encompassing 43 states and the District of Columbia, covering 88% of the United States. The network is offered to prospective affiliates on a barter basis, an agreement in which the station will get the programming at little or no cost in exchange for giving a certain amount of commercial time to the network. Despite this arrangement, some larger television markets without stations owned by Tribune did not affiliate with the network until 2015. As of May 1, 2016, the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose market is the largest television market without an Antenna TV affiliate, after KRON-TV dropped the network in favor of Sony's GetTV. Tribune Broadcasting planned to launch Antenna TV in all markets with stations owned by Tribune and, as part of a co- management agreement between the two groups that existed at the time of the network's launch, Local TV. Tribune's flagship station WGN-TV in Chicago serves as the de facto flagship station of the network. In Denver and St. Louis, two of the markets where Tribune maintains duopolies, the Antenna TV affiliation went to digital subchannels of Local TV-owned Fox affiliates KDVR and KTVI, rather than on Tribune-owned CW affiliates KWGN-TV and KPLR-TV ‚Äì which were operated alongside KDVR and KTVI under local marketing agreements ‚Äì in order to address bandwidth concerns as the two Tribune outlets already maintained subchannels carrying This TV (ABC and Fox stations transmit their main signals by default in 720p, which provides a lower bit rate adequate for multiplexing of up to three subchannels, while the main channels of CBS, NBC and CW stations are usually transmitted in the higher resolution 1080i format, which before advances in multiplexer technology, utilized a larger bit rate size that was more susceptible to causing pixelation of multiple subchannels). However, not all of the charter affiliates added Antenna TV at its launch either to allow stations to reconfigure their bandwidth or to assure the affiliated subchannel's carriage on cable providers when the network launched locally. Fox affiliate KSTU in Salt Lake City, NBC affiliate WHO-TV in Des Moines (both owned by Local TV at the time) and CW affiliate WDCW in Washington, D.C. (owned by Tribune) debuted the network on their digital subchannels later during January 2011; while NBC affiliate KFOR-TV in Oklahoma City did not add the network until April 21, 2011, on a new third digital subchannel (it has since been moved to that station's second subchannel). The final Tribune/Local TV market to add the network was Fort Smith, Arkansas, where Fayetteville-based MyNetworkTV affiliate KXNW began carrying the network on January 5, 2012, as an overnight secondary service; Antenna TV was unable to launch in the market prior to the KXNW purchase due to existing syndicated programming rights held by CBS-affiliated sister KFSM-TV for its MyNetworkTV- affiliated subchannel (which now acts as a KXNW simulcast) and the station's main signal being transmitted in 1080i, which precluded a launch of a third subchannel without affecting picture quality. Some affiliates (such as KTLA in Los Angeles) aired preview blocks of Antenna TV programming on their primary channel in the lead-up to the launch date. In the wake of Universal Sports converting from a digital broadcast to a cable and satellite service on January 1, 2012, most stations affiliated with that network signed affiliation agreements with Antenna TV (or MeTV) to serve as a replacement. To date, Antenna TV has had three instances of switching affiliates in the same market. In Honolulu, Hawaii, the network moved from charter affiliate KUPU (one of only two stations that carried the network on its primary channel, the other being KXNW, which is the only affiliate that continues to do so) to the secondary subchannel of NBC affiliate KHNL in May 2012, as KUPU was not available on cable television in areas of the state outside the Honolulu metropolitan area whereas KNHL has widespread cable penetration. WJZY in Charlotte, North Carolina, which served as its original affiliate for that market, replaced Antenna TV on its 46.2 subchannel with Movies! (a network part-owned by Fox Television Stations, which bought WJZY in April 2013) on July 1, 2014; WCCB (which, incidentally, assumed the CW affiliation held by WJZY when the latter switched to Fox on July 1, 2013) began carrying Antenna TV on digital subchannel 18.2 on August 15 of that year. WSTR-TV in Cincinnati added the network on January 1, 2016, displacing GetTV on its 64.2 subchannel, one month after the network terminated its affiliation with low-power outlet WOTH-CD2 to expand its coverage within the market. On November 17, 2015, Tribune announced that it had signed affiliation agreements with the Sinclair Broadcast Group and partner company Deerfield Media, Tegna Media, Red River Broadcasting and GOCOM Media to add Antenna TV to stations in 26 markets (including many large and mid-sized markets where the network did not previously have an affiliate, including Pittsburgh; Baltimore; Nashville; Birmingham; Green Bay and Savannah). On January 6, 2016, the network also announced an agreement with E. W. Scripps Company-owned WMYD in Detroit, which picked up the affiliation in February 2016, six months after WADL disaffiliated from Antenna TV, which briefly left Detroit as the largest market where the network did not have an affiliate. Sean Compton, president of strategic programming and acquisitions for Tribune Broadcasting, credited Antenna TV's acquisition of rights to the Johnny Carson-era Tonight Show episodes in part behind the newfound interest from affiliates, which helped its station portfolio gain ground with competitor MeTV (which has the most affiliates of any American digital multicast network). As a result of these and other agreements stemming from the Carson acquisition, by August 2016, the network had expanded its reach to 86% of U.S. households. Individual programs aired by the network may be substituted if a station other than that which serves as the market's Antenna TV affiliate holds the local syndication rights; as an example, from April 2012 to November 2013, KTLA aired a rebroadcast of that station's weeknight 6:00 p.m. newscast on Monday through Thursdays over its 5.2 subchannel, in place of the network's broadcast of Married... with Children (which it aired in an hour-long block and was shown locally at 8:00 p.m. Pacific Time), as the local rights to the sitcom were held by Anaheim-based independent station KDOC-TV. When Soap replaced Married... on the network's Sunday evening lineup in May 2011, during the latter's original run on Antenna TV, a rebroadcast of KTLA's early evening newscast which aired on that night was dropped in order to allow Soap to air locally. In markets where an Antenna TV-affiliated station acts as a broadcast partner of either sports syndication service, some of its stations (notably among them, WHNT-DT2 in Huntsville, Alabama and WOAI-TV DT2 in San Antonio) preempt programming carried by the network in order to carry college sports events produced by either the Raycom Sports-operated ACC Network or the Sinclair-owned American Sports Network/Stadium. While these preemptions typically occur on Saturday afternoons, in many instances, such stations may preempt certain programs aired within the network's prime time lineup, either to allow the affiliated subchannel to serve as an alternate feed of the partner sports service in lieu of the parent station's main channel or a co- owned/co-managed sister station, or to carry programs aired by a major broadcast network with which the station maintains a primary affiliation so the events can air on the main channel. Conversely, several stations, mainly affiliated with Fox, have moved their local newscasts to their Antenna TV subchannel due to sports events like the 2018 FIFA World Cup and Thursday Night Football pre-empting regularly scheduled newscasts on the main channel. In March 2020, new owner Nexstar Media Group brought the network to markets in which it owned stations that did not already have a pre-existing affiliate at the time of their purchase of Tribune.

Life He entered the Franciscans in Bruges in about 1240 and was sent to Paris for his studies. A student of Bonaventure, he was regent master at Paris from 1267 to 1269. He was elected minister provincial of the French province in 1269, then became bishop of Poitiers in 1279, a post which he held until 1306, when he retired because of ill health. He died the following year. His family name was probably Van den Zande. He wrote Sermones per totum annum and Excerpta ex sanctis Patribus (Augustine, Gregory, Jerome, Ambrose, Hilary, Isadore and others)Zawart 1928 but was not widely known until the publication of Quaestiones Disputatae. With Bonaventure, he was a teacher of Matthew of Aquasparta.  Philosophy  As a follower of Bonaventure, Walter accepted that the existence of God is \\"the first truth\\" and therefore could not be proved a priori. The school of which he formed part differed from Thomas Aquinas, who held that God's existence can be proved a posteriori but not a priori (see Summa Theologica, I, 2, 1 and I, 2, 3), but contended that being itself was the first object of knowledge.

After Mahratta broke up, the ship was found to be resting on top of the first Mahratta. History SS Mahratta was launched on 20 October 1917. Its name is an old spelling of Maratha. On 6 April 1936, SS Matheran lost her propellor off Port Sudan. It was decided that Mahratta would tow Matheran the to Suez where another ship would tow Matheran to Alexandria for repairs. Despite Matheran being a bigger ship than Mahratta, the tow was completed at an average speed of . =Shipwreck= On 9 October 1939, Mahratta was inbound to London from Calcutta when she ran aground on the Goodwins. Mahratta had originally been bound for Liverpool but received new orders at Gibraltar to sail to London. Mahratta left Gibraltar as part of Convoy HG 1 on 26 September 1939. In blackout conditions she ran aground on Fork Spit, less than a mile away from where the first Mahratta had run aground. The Deal hoveller Lady Haig was given charge of the salvage operations. A tug attempted to move Mahratta into deeper water the next day, but the plates on her port side buckled and by nightfall Mahratta had broken in two. The crew of Mahratta were transferred to the steamer Challenge in four trips. On the third trip, a lifeboat full of luggage salvaged from Mahratta was taken in tow, but a large wave almost capsized Lady Haig and the lifeboat was cast adrift after the ten crew from Mahratta on it were rescued. They were landed at Dover.

Kennedy (D-MA), took positions on many political issues throughout his career via his public comments and senatorial voting record. This is a summary of some of them. Abortion Although he was a staunch pro- choice advocate for the past 30 years, Kennedy adopted this position only after the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973. Prior to that, he held a pro-life position. A letter to a constituent dated August 3, 1971 opposed legal abortion on demand. Kennedy's reversal on this issue after Roe v. Wade became a source of continuing dispute between him and the Catholic Church, of which he was a member. In 1987, Kennedy delivered an impassioned speech condemning Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork as a \\"right-wing extremist\\" and warning that \\"Robert Bork's America\\" would be one marked by back alley abortions and other backward practices. Kennedy's strong opposition to Bork's nomination was important to the Senate's rejection of Bork's candidacy. In recent years, he has argued that much of the debate over abortion is a false dichotomy. Speaking at the National Press Club in 2005, he remarked, \\"Surely, we can all agree that abortion should be rare, and that we should do all we can to help women avoid the need to face that decision.\\"Dionne, E.J. \\"The New Liberalism: Democrats Need to Show Their Family Values\\", Washington Post, January 14, 2005, page A19. He voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Affirmative action Kennedy supported affirmative action. In 1996 he called Patrick Chavis a \\"perfect example\\" of how affirmative action worked.Patrick Chavis, 50, Affirmative Action Figure, Is Dead The Boston Globe: AFFIRMATIVE ACTION CAN BE FATAL Affirmative Action Hero: The Life and Death of Patrick Chavis[Los Angeles Times]: Doctor in Landmark Anti-Bias Case Slain Immigration policy Kennedy introduced and was a strong supporter of the 1965 Hart-Celler Actsigned into law by President Lyndon B. Johnsonwhich dramatically changed U.S. immigration policy.Three Decades of Mass Immigration: The Legacy of the 1965 Immigration Act, Center for Immigration Studies, September 1995. Accessed online December 26, 2006. Kennedy said, \\"The bill will not flood our cities with immigrants. It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. It will not relax the standards of admission. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs.\\"U.S. Senate, Subcommittee on Immigration and Naturalization of the Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, D.C., February 10, 1965, pp. 1‚Äì3. Kennedy asserted that the bill would end the favoring of Europeans for immigration into the United States. The 1965 legislation replaced the Immigration Act of 1924, which favored immigrants from northern and western Europe and Canada. Proponents of the 1965 bill argued that immigration laws and quotas were discriminatory, and that American immigration policy should accept people not on the basis of their nationality. This also abolished the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Kennedy's bill was designed to reallocate visas to poorer countries and also added the stipulation that extended families of visa holders would also be eligible for visas. Although Kennedy promised the bill would not increase the number of immigrants into the United States or change the ethnic composition of the United States, immigration numbers doubled from 1965 to 1970 and then doubled again before 1990. Kennedy was the chairman of the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship, and remained a strong advocate for immigrants. Kennedy subsequently took a lead role in several other would-be immigration measures, including the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act (S. 1033) (\\"McCain-Kennedy\\") in 2005 and the Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007, a bipartisan measure worked out with President George W. Bush which ultimately failed on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Among other reforms, the 1033 legislation proposed allowing \\"undocumented immigrants in the U.S. to come out of the shadows, submit to background checks, and register for a legal status. Immigrants and their families would have six years to earn permanent residence and ultimately citizenship.\\" Gun laws Kennedy was a staunch supporter of gun control initiatives. In 2006, he was one of the 16 senators who voted against the Vitter Amendment prohibiting the confiscation of legally possessed firearms during a disaster. Energy policy Kennedy generally favored alternative energy sources and opposed additional Alaska oil drilling. However, he opposed the Cape Wind wind turbine project which would occur near his home.Ted Kennedy on Energy & Oil, On the Issues (issues2000.org). Accessed online December 26, 2006.Bending with the Wind Wiretapping With Mikhail Gorbachev.

Current Biography Yearbook 1978. H. W. Wilson Company, pg. 226 Despite publicly becoming a major voice for some in the anti-war movement, it was acknowledged that Kennedy refused to heed calls to investigate the legality of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and that in October 1965, Kennedy publicly denounced the growing number of anti- war demonstrations while visiting the South Vietnam capital of Saigon to discuss refugee problems.https://books.google.com/books?id=dLnPAgAAQBAJ&pg;=PA29&lpg;=PA29&dq;=ted+kennedy+1965+saigon&source;=bl&ots;=e22Tbo5XD8&sig;=ACfU3U26zUKS8fR5LIvUQo6sBHlj64hjDA&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiTt_vlvdfoAhWmB50JHegyAp4Q6AEwD3oECAoQKQ#v=onepage&q;=ted%20kennedy%201965%20saigon&f;=falsehttps://www.britishpathe.com/video/ted- kennedy-in-vietnamhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THEB0L4bsCc He supported not only the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, but also the massive U.S. bombing campaign in North Vietnam as well. He also supported increasing the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam from 23,000 to 175,000 and openly promoted the war effort when he told students at Boston University that a U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam \\"would permanently undermine our credit with other nations in the area while we are trying to remain independent of the powerful and historic influence exerted in China.\\" = Afghanistan = Kennedy was a supporter of the War in Afghanistan and the overthrow of the Taliban government in Afghanistan in reaction to the September 11 attacks. = Iraq = Kennedy opposed the American-led 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq. The AUMF against Iraq, which would authorize a military invasion and sustained occupation in Iraq was voted for in 2002. Kennedy was intensely opposed to the bill, as it would hand over complete military control and maneuverability to the President. Such precedent would not only allow tyrannical military policy, but an undermining of the Democrats. He had also been a harsh critic of the way the invasion of Iraq was planned and conducted by the Bush administration. Kennedy also had said that the best vote he had ever cast in the Senate was his vote against giving President Bush the authority to use force against Iraq.Kennedy fights 'immense new mistake' of troop surge - CNN.com As the Iraqi insurgency grew in subsequent years, Kennedy pronounced that the conflict was \\"Bush's Vietnam.\\" In response to losses of Massachusetts service personnel to roadside bombs, Kennedy became vocal on the issue of Humvee vulnerability, and co-sponsored enacted 2005 legislation that sped up production and Army procurement of up-armored Humvees.

Ted Kennedy at the National Press Club, YouTube.com, January 9, 2007. Accessed online February 22, 2007. Kennedy was the first Senator in the 110th Congress to propose legislation opposing the troop surge. = Israel = Ted Kennedy was a staunch supporter of Israel while in the Senate,http://www.aipac.org/130.asp#27922 and was mourned by Israeli leaders such as Shimon Peres and Avigdor Lieberman as a \\"friend to Israel\\" when he died.http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1251145117814&pagename;=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull According to one tally, Ted Kennedy voted 100 percent in concert with positions taken by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.http://www.jewishjournal.com/bloggish/item/ted_kennedy_israel_and_the_jews_20090826/ During the run up to the Iraq War, Kennedy said '\\"Iran has had closer ties to terrorism than Iraq ... Iran has a nuclear weapons development program, and it already has a missile that can reach Israel.\\" Ted Kennedy's death gained massive public attention in Israel, as all the Kennedy brothers were big supporters of the Jewish state, including Ted Kennedy. In his Senate career, Kennedy promoted US aid to Israel and fought against proposed arms sales to Jordan and Saudi Arabia. He became the first American politician to meet with Soviet refuseniks in 1974. He rebuked the George H. W. Bush administration when it stopped loan guarantees with Israeli given the Israeli settlement issue. He also opposed dividing Jerusalem up in a peace deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Kennedy, \\"a great friend of Israel\\", and he continued by saying that Kennedy would be missed. Jewish Agency Chairman Natan Sharansky, who was a prisoner of Zion in the Soviet Union, told The Jerusalem Post, \\"When we were in prison - when I was in prison - Senator Kennedy was one of the most important contacts for our wives and families. He helped bring down the iron curtain and he helped Soviet Jews immigrate to Israel.\\" \\"Kennedy was clearly a friend of Israel all the way, and in every place that he could help us he did,\\" said Israeli President Shimon Peres. His death was \\"a very big loss to every sensitive and thinking person the world over. May his soul rest in peace.\\" The Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a condolence for the loss of Ted Kennedy, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs, Avigdor Lieberman, talked about how Ted Kennedy would be missed and how great of a friend he was for Israel. :\\"Our alliance with Israel is an alliance based on common democratic ideals and mutual benefit. In the critical region of the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East, Israel is a rock of strength, stability, and friendship, ... We must never barter the freedom and future of Israel for a barrel of oil - or foolishly try to align the Arab world with us, no matter what cost.\\" :-Ted Kennedy's speech in 1980 = Northern Ireland = Kennedy was outspoken in his views about Northern Ireland's constitutional question. In October 1971, he called for the withdrawal of British troops from Northern Ireland, and for all political participants there to begin talks on creating a United Ireland. In early 2005, however, Kennedy publicly snubbed Gerry Adams by canceling a previously arranged meeting, citing the Provisional Irish Republican Army's \\"ongoing criminal activity and contempt for the rule of law.\\" This decision was a direct result of the Northern Bank robbery in December 2004 and the murder of Robert McCartney the following month. Education Kennedy became notorious in the 1970s for his support of desegregation busing. He was one of that members of Congress, government, and judges and journalists who supported busing but sent their own children to private schools. Speaking at the dedication ceremonies of the Connell School of Nursing, Boston College. Kennedy was a leading member of the bipartisan team that wrote the controversial No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. According to both Kennedy and President Bush, the Act was a compromise. Kennedy then worked on its passage through a Republican-controlled Congress, despite opposition from members of both parties. Kennedy opposed federal attempts to cut student financial aid, such as Reagan's 1986 planned limitations on Guaranteed Student Loans to students whose families earned over $32,500 a year, and a planned $4,000 cap on all federal aid and benefits that a student could receive in one year. Following the Republican takeover of Congress in November 1994, there was a renewed effort on the part of key Republican leaders to balance the federal budget by cutting financial aid. The new cuts, which Kennedy also opposed, involved reducing the interest the federal government would pay on student loans, and on Clinton's direct lending program. Kennedy supported the College Affordability and Access Act of 2007 which provides $20 billion in new federal financial aid investments for low- and middle-income students and their families.Senator Kennedy and Student Aid at NU: An Online Exhibit, Northeastern University Libraries, Archives and Special Collections, May 2008.

Judicial appointments A longtime member of the Senate Judiciary Committee (and its chairman from 1979 to 1981), Kennedy was an important Democratic voice during debates and confirmation votes on United States Supreme Court nominees. He and Daniel Inouye, also elected in 1962, voted on more appointments than every other Senator except Robert Byrd. Kennedy supported nominations of Abe Fortas and Thurgood Marshall (both by President Lyndon B. Johnson). Of Richard Nixon's nominees, he backed successful nominations of Warren Burger (for Chief Justice), Harry Blackmun and Lewis F. Powell. Like most of Democrats he opposed G. Harrold Carswell and Clement Haynsworth (both rejected). He also voted against confirmation of William H. Rehnquist as Associate Justice, although he was easily confirmed. Kennedy supported Gerald Ford's nomination of John Paul Stevens, who was confirmed unanimously. Of Ronald Reagan's nominees, he supported Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy (confirmed), but was one of the leaders of opposition against the nomination of Robert Bork. Within 45 minutes of Bork's nomination to the Court he took to the Senate floor with a strong condemnation of Bork in a nationally televised speech, declaring, \\"Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, and schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of government.\\".Court nominees will trigger rapid response  csmonitor.com Bork's nomination was rejected, and Kennedy was credited with leading Democratic opposition. Democratic Senator Joseph Biden, though, said that Kennedy's speech was \\"technically accurate but unfair\\" and said that it \\"drew lines in ways that were starker than reality\\". Kennedy also opposed William Rehnquist's successful nomination to become Chief Justice.Our Campaigns - Candidate - Edward \\"Ted\\" Kennedy He opposed both of George H. W. Bush's successful nominations, David Souter and Clarence Thomas, as well, but supported Bill Clinton's nominations of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. He strongly opposed the successful nominations of both Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, both nominated by President George W. Bush. From 2001 to 2003, Kennedy led a forty-five member all Democrat Senate filibuster to block the appointment of former assistant Solicitor General Miguel Estrada to the United States court of appeals. When Estrada withdrew his nomination, Kennedy proclaimed it was \\"a victory for the Constitution.\\" Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights Kennedy was considered to be one of the biggest advocates of LGBT rights in the U.S. Senate,No 'heir apparent' to Kennedy on gay issues in Congress - Southern Voice Atlanta and he received ratings of 100 percent by the Human Rights Campaign for the 107th, 108th and 109th sessions of U.S. Congress, indicating that he voted in support of issues the HRC considers important with regards to equality for LGBT persons. He was one of the Senate's very few supporters of same-sex marriage and was one of the fourteen senators to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. He also voted against the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment in 2004 and 2006. Kennedy's home state of Massachusetts was the first state to legalize same-sex marriage in 2004. Wage and price controls Kennedy was a longtime advocate of raising the minimum wage. He helped pass the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, which incrementally raises the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 over a two-year period. The bill also included some controversial tax cuts for small businesses and higher taxes for many $1 million-plus executives. Kennedy was quoted as saying, \\"Passing this wage hike represents a small, but necessary step to help lift America's working poor out of the ditches of poverty and onto the road toward economic prosperity\\".Senate votes to raise minimum wage, Chicago Tribune, February 1, 2007. Accessed online February 22, 2007. In the 1970s, Kennedy joined with fellow senators Ernest Hollings and Henry M. Jackson in a press conference to oppose President Gerald Ford's request that Congress end Richard Nixon's price controls on domestic oil, which had helped to cause the gasoline lines during the 1973 Oil Crisis. Kennedy said he believed ending the price controls (which have been blamed for increasing America's dependence on foreign oil and were ended in 1981) would produce \\"no additional oil.\\" Environmental record Kennedy had a strong pro-environment voting record.League of Conservation Voters. He voted in favor of disallowing an oil leasing program in Alaska's ANWR, removing oil and gas exploration subsidies, including oil and gas smokestacks in mercury regulations and reducing funds to road building in forest. He voted against reducing funding to renewable and solar energy projects, requiring ethanol in gasoline, Bush administration energy policy and approving a nuclear waste repository.On the issues:Environment Kennedy was a critic of the Bush administration's environmental record and has stated \\"We must not let the administration distort science and rewrite and manipulate scientific reports in other areas. We must not let it turn the Environmental Protection Agency into the Environmental Pollution Agency\\".Washington Post, January 12, 2005. Health care Kennedy believed that health care coverage was a fundamental right for all individuals and fought for universal health care in the United States until his death. In 2010, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Health Care for America Act to provide near universal health care coverage in the United States by 2014. Kennedy's widow, Vicki attended the signing ceremony for the bill. 18-year- old right to vote Senator Kennedy was a long proponent of the 18-year-old's right to vote. He demonstrated his support in his testimony in front of the Subcommittee for Lowering the Voting Age to 18. During his testimony he stated: \\"Long ago, according to historians, the age of maturity was fixed at 21, because that was the age at which a young man was thought to be capable of bearing armor. Strange as it may seem, the weight of armor in the 11th century governs the right to vote of Americans in the 20th century.\\"Committee on the Judiciary, Lowering the Voting Age to 18, 91d Cong., 2nd ses., 1970, 157. Senator Kennedy continued to support this initiative until it was realized with the signing of the Twenty-sixth Amendment on July 5, 1971.

It runs the Kent and Canterbury Hospital (Canterbury), William Harvey Hospital (Ashford), Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital (Margate), Buckland Hospital (Dover), and the Royal Victoria Hospital (Folkestone) - and some outpatient facilities in the East Kent and Medway areas in England. It serves a local population of around 759,000 people. It is a teaching trust involved in the education and training of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals, with King's College London and, since 2018, Kent and Medway Medical School. Development The Trust, with Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust was jointly procuring an electronic patient record system in a contract worth ¬£10m - ¬£40m in December 2013. In April 2014 it was reported that the Trust was looking for a partner to develop a private hospital at the William Harvey Hospital site and enhance the returns from the Spencer private hospital on the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital site with a contract over the next 15 to 15 years. The Trust's proposal to centralise surgery on the Canterbury site in order to manage problems caused by \\"the increasing sub-specialisation of surgery, the lack of availability of surgeons with skills that are essential to managing high risk and emergency general surgery, and the difficulty recruiting both permanent and locum medical staff\\" in May 2014 aroused opposition among consultants. In May 2018 the trust announced plans to transfer 850 cleaning, catering, switchboard and portering staff who work for Serco and 250 NHS staff working on estates, procurement and facilities to a new limited company owned by the trust and described as a social enterprise. Performance Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England In 2010, it was named \\"Trust of the Year 2010\\" by the healthcare information organisation Dr Foster.East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust named Trust of the Year in the 2010 Hospital Guide The Trust was placed in special measures by Monitor (NHS) in September 2014 following an unfavourable report from the Care Quality Commission. In 2015 the Trauma Audit & Research Network showed that the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford was the best performing hospital receiving trauma patients in England and Wales, out of 100 hospitals offering trauma facilities across the country, according to survival rates of patients. The Care Quality Commission upgraded the Trust from \\"inadequate\\" to \\"requires improvement\\" and cited significant improvements. Two of the Trust‚Äôs five hospitals were rated as \\"Good\\". It was one of 26 responsible for half of the national growth in patients waiting more than four hours in accident and emergency over the 2014/5 winter. It hit controversy when an RAF sergeant was asked to leave the waiting room in case his uniform upset other patients. It admitted breaching a patient's human rights when it placed a \\"do not resuscitate\\" (DNR) order on the patients notes because the patient had learning difficulties. The trust had not consulted the family about the decision. In 2016 the Trust saw improvements in its annual Patient-Led Assessment in Care Environments audits, which were introduced nationally in 2013. All hospitals, hospices and day treatment centres that give NHS-funded care are subject to a PLACE inspection. In April 2016 it admitted that it could not cope with the overwhelming demand on its ophthalmology department, which saw nearly 100,000 patients in 2015/6. 7000 were in need of follow-up and at risk of deteriorating eyesight. In October 2017 after months of very poor performance against the A&E; four hour target it was clearly the worst performing trust in England on A&E; in 2017-18, with around 30%t of patients waiting over four hours. The Chair of the trust, Nikki Cole, resigned and was replaced by Peter Carter. In 2017-18 East Kent Hospitals saw 74.3% of A&E; patients within four hours.The 10 worst A&Es; for waits revealed BBC In August 2018 it announced that planned orthopaedic operations would be moved from the William Harvey Hospital to the Kent and Canterbury Hospital in an attempt to avoid cancellations. In 2018 it had 214 estates and facilities related incidents. It runs more than 100 buildings, some of which date back to the 1930s, and appealed for ¬£34 million in emergency capital funding in January 2019. The trust commissioned 28 beds from a residential home, Ami Lodge in Deal, Kent, to support patients medically fit to leave hospital but not able to return to their own home. It was forced to abandon the scheme when the Care Quality Commission rated the home \\"inadequate\\" in November 2018. In 2020 the BBC found 7 cases of babies either stillborn or who died shortly after birth since 2016, these cases should have been prevented with better care. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists found in 2015, consultants, failing to do labour ward rounds, failing to review women, make care plans or attend out of hours when asked, consultants, rarely did CTG training, and reportedly were, \\"doing their own thing rather than follow guidelines\\" Staff alleged at the review, the board did not consider maternity services a priority and no action would be taken over concerns raised. In 2014 the trust was put into special measures after Care Quality Commission rated its care, including maternity care inadequate. Since then the CQC rated it as requiring improvement.East Kent hospitals: Baby deaths 'could have been prevented' BBC From 2016 to 2019 the trust had to close one of its two maternity units, which are nearly 40 miles apart, to new births 111 times. At least 120 women in labour were diverted. Although it is not unusual for maternity units close or divert for short periods these closures were unusually frequent.

CoRR is short for \\"co-location for redox regulation\\", itself a shortened form of \\"co-location (of gene and gene product) for (evolutionary) continuity of redox regulation of gene expression\\". CoRR was put forward explicitly in 1993 in a paper in the Journal of Theoretical Biology with the title \\"Control of gene expression by redox potential and the requirement for chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes\\". The central concept had been outlined in a review of 1992. The term CoRR was introduced in 2003 in a paper in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society entitled \\"The function of genomes in bioenergetic organelles\\". The problem =Chloroplasts and mitochondria= Chloroplasts and mitochondria are energy-converting organelles in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. Chloroplasts in plant cells perform photosynthesis; the capture and conversion of the energy of sunlight. Mitochondria in both plant and animal cells perform respiration; the release of this stored energy when work is done. In addition to these key reactions of bioenergetics, chloroplasts and mitochondria each contain specialized and discrete genetic systems. These genetic systems enable chloroplasts and mitochondria to make some of their own proteins. Both the genetic and energy-converting systems of chloroplasts and mitochondria are descended, with little modification, from those of the free-living bacteria that these organelles once were. The existence of these cytoplasmic genomes is consistent with, and counts as evidence for, the endosymbiont hypothesis. Most genes for proteins of chloroplasts and mitochondria are, however, now located on chromosomes in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells. There they code for protein precursors that are made in the cytosol for subsequent import into the organelles. =Why do mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own genetic systems?= =Cytoplasmic inheritance= CoRR seeks to explain why chloroplasts and mitochondria retain DNA, and thus why some characters are inherited through the cytoplasm in the phenomenon of cytoplasmic, non- Mendelian, uniparental, or maternal inheritance. CoRR does so by offering an answer to this question: why, in evolution, did some bacterial, endosymbiont genes move to the cell nucleus, while others did not? Proposed solution CoRR states that chloroplasts and mitochondria contain those genes whose expression is required to be under the direct, regulatory control of the redox state of their gene products, or of electron carriers with which those gene products interact. Such genes comprise a core, or primary subset, of organellar genes. The requirement for redox control of each gene in the primary subset then confers an advantage upon location of that gene within the organelle. Natural selection therefore anchors some genes in organelles, while favouring location of others in the cell nucleus. Chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes also contain genes for components of the chloroplast and mitochondrial genetic systems themselves. These genes comprise a secondary subset of organellar genes: genetic system genes. There is generally no requirement for redox control of expression of genetic system genes, though their being subject to redox control may, in some cases, allow amplification of redox signals acting upon genes in the primary subset (bioenergetic genes). Retention of genes of the secondary subset (genetic system genes) is necessary for the operation of redox control of expression of genes in the primary subset. If all genes disappear from the primary subset, CoRR predicts that there is no function for genes in the secondary subset, and such organelles will then, eventually, lose their genomes completely. However, if even only one gene remains under redox control, then an organelle genetic system is required for the synthesis of its single gene product. Evidence * Different products of protein synthesis in isolated chloroplasts and mitochondria are obtained in the presence of redox reagents with different redox potentials. In mitochondria, the effect results from a redox signal at the level of respiratory complex II. * Genes in chloroplasts are selected for transcription according to the redox state of the electron carrier plastoquinone. These genes code for photosynthetic reaction centers and other components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. * A modified bacterial sensor kinase couples transcription in chloroplasts to plastoquinone redox state. This chloroplast sensor kinase is inherited from cyanobacteria and encoded in plant nuclear DNA. Chloroplast sensor kinase is part of a redox two-component regulatory system in eukaryotes. * Genes most commonly retained in mitochondrial DNA fulfil central roles in the structure of their respective protein complexes, suggesting that their organellar retention allows efficient local control of complex assembly.

Afterward, Jack tells Charlene that even though he has a wife, he's still interested in forming a relationship with her. Charlene agrees to pursue a relationship with him, but as the affair goes on, she notices herself quickly beginning to change. Charlene begins to feel that she is losing her identity; she begins to feel intense anxiety and paranoia about confronting Jack's wife, and deep loneliness and longing when he isn't around. She even goes as far as to lie awake at night with her door unlocked, hoping that he will come over. As the affair continues, Charlene decides to confront Jack about how she lacks emotional support and comfort because he isn't with her enough. Jack confesses to Charlene that he has been separated from his wife; feeling betrayed, Charlene kicks him out of her apartment. Her love for him quickly dissolves, and even though her days become long and tedious, she doesn't let her love for him come back.Moore,Lorrie. \\"How to Be an Other Woman.\\" Self-Help: Stories. New York: Knopf, 1985. 3-22. =\\"What is Seized\\"= ‚ÄúWhat is Seized‚Äù, by Lorrie Moore, is a short story in which the narrator, Lynnie, describes the relationship between her mother and father while she watches her mother's mental and physical health deteriorate. Her mother was married to a cold man and while it is not out rightly stated, it is implied that her father was cheating. Even though her mother has been through a lot, she is trying to show her daughter that she still had a good life and enjoyed all the beautiful parts of it. =\\"The Kid's Guide to Divorce\\"= A daughter and her divorced mother hang out for the evening at their home. After making popcorn, the daughter joins her mother who is listening to music on the television. When the program is over, the mother asks her daughter to suggest a new program for them to watch. The daughter suggests \\"The Late, Late Chiller,\\" a horror movie with a mummy and a werewolf. Cuddling next to each other, the two converse casually until they are interrupted by a minor incident in which the daughter chokes on a piece of popcorn. After a while, the daughter expresses her disgust with the movie, the mother suggests switching to Channel 7, where a rock concert is showing. The daughter agrees and makes the switch. They both give their opinions on the various acts that come on stage until the daughter announces her intention to go to bed. Before she can leave, however, the mother asks how the past three days with her father went. The daughter responds, \\"they went all right,\\" but specifically leaves out details of alcohol and the fact that her father is with a new woman. =\\"How\\"= This second person narrative is told from the point of view of a girl in a struggling relationship. After dating her boyfriend for a while, she begins to grow bored of him and contemplates the good and bad aspects of the relationship. Her unhappiness persists, which leads her to have a short affair. She also starts lashing out at her boyfriend because everything he does gets on her nerves. He wants to have kids and start a family, but she is not ready to take that step with him. After planning her get away she attempts to break up with him, but news of him being sick keeps her from leaving. Going to doctor appointments, and doing what she can to help him get well, she still wants to leave but it never feels like the right time. Another long term affair ensues; she sneaks around and lies to her boyfriend about what she is doing even though he knows the truth. Finally, she takes him to dinner and tells him she wants to break up. She moves out, and after having time to heal, feels nothing but indifference towards leaving him. =\\"Go Like This\\"= =\\"How to Talk to Your Mother (Notes)\\"= A daughter recollects her lifetime with and without her mother in a timeline starting after her mother's death and working backward to her own birth. In each year of her lifetime, the narrator highlights parts of her life that are influential to her character. The story covers her mother's death, the sickness of her mother, her father's death, the narrator's few suitors, and her childhood. Readers follow the narrator on a personal level, allowing insight into who she is as a person and the events that made her that way, ultimately leading to the beginning of the woman's life. =\\"Amahl and the Night Visitors: A Guide to the Tenor of Love\\"= In ‚ÄúAmahal and the Night Visitors: A Guide to the Tenor of Love,‚Äù Lorrie Moore writes about a breakup between the main character, Trudy and her boyfriend Moss. She writes the story in second person, along with the majority of her other stories, so that the reader can connect with the characters on a personal level. The story is broken up into journal entries. Some days Trudy has long, elaborate entries, and other days she only writes a few words. Trudy constantly obsesses over something. She believes that Moss is cheating on her with a fellow cast member, then she believes that Moss is cheating on her with Bob, and she worries about her cat. In some parts of the story, the reader can see a connection between Moss and the cat. She and Moss disagree on whether the cat belongs inside or outside. Trudy doesn't want to let the cat go but Moss disagrees. Finally Trudy lets the cat out, but it never returns. Just like Moss, at the end of the story he leaves her. In both relationships, Trudy is overprotective, and that is what eventually ruins both. =\\"How to Become a Writer\\"= The second person narrative follows a determined girl named Francie and her constant struggle with wanting to have a career in writing. She fails often. However, she continues to follow her dream of becoming a writer despite the many difficulties that come her way. We follow the writer through several stages of her life where failure has impacted her becoming a writer, from unsuccessful short stories to her literary demise. The story ends with Francie finding tedious things to do to pass time because she has altogether failed and has severed nearly all personal connections. Still, she is convinced she took the right path and is glad she isn't like everyone else whose lives go \\"always in the same direction\\".Moore, Lorrie (5/8/2014). Self-Help: Stories. Vintage Books. p. 52. . =\\"To Fill\\"= Riva, a depressed retail manager, visits the hospital where her mother receives treatment for mental illness. During these visits, Riva convinces herself that her mother would be fine without the hospital, but Riva's view of reality is warped because she also wishes her life was better, like her mother's. Her mother expresses her wish for Riva to get back together with her boyfriend Phillip, but she forgets that Riva has been married to another man, Tom, for six years. Riva is stuck on losing Phillip, hinting that the title of the story, \\"To Fill,\\" may be a letter ‚Äúto Phillip,‚Äù as a play on words. Riva's life goes in a downward spiral, and when she catches Tom with his mistress, she stabs him in the stomach. The story ends with Riva in the same hospital as her mom, thinking about her life and the possibility of seeing her son again.

Attached to the 21st Brigade that was assigned to the 7th Division, the 2/16th was raised in 1940 as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force from volunteers drawn mainly from the state of Western Australia. After training in Australia, the battalion was deployed to the Middle East where it undertook defensive duties along the Egyptian‚ÄìLibyan border in early 1941 before taking part in the Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign, fighting against Vichy French forces in June and July. At the conclusion of the campaign, the 2/16th remained in Lebanon, contributing to the Allied occupation force there, before returning to Australia in early 1942 following Japan's entry into the war. In August 1942, they were committed to the fighting along the Kokoda Track and then later fought around Buna and Gona. After a period of rest and reorganisation in Australia, the battalion fought around Lae and then took part in the Finisterre Range campaign in 1943‚Äì44. Its final campaign of the war came in Borneo in July 1945. At the end of the war, the 2/16th were disbanded in January 1946. History =Formation and service in the Middle East= The 2/16th Battalion was recruited in Perth, in the state of Western Australia in early 1940, with its first war diary entry being made on 20 April 1940. Raised from volunteers from the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), which was established for overseas service at the start of the war,Grey 2008, p. 146. many of the battalion's early recruits were from the goldfields of Western Australia. After the concentration and training of the battalion's initial cadre in Perth, the battalion was moved to Northam where on 30 April the first draft of recruits arrived and the process of forming the battalion's subunits began. With an authorised strength of around 900 personnel,Palazzo 2004, p. 94. like other Australian infantry battalions of the time, the battalion was formed around a nucleus of four rifle companies ‚Äì designated 'A' through to 'D' ‚Äì each consisting of three platoons.Long 1952, p. 52. The unit conducted its own basic training, which was only partially completed prior to its embarkation for Egypt in October 1940. The battalion's first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Baxter-Cox, and, along with the 2/14th and 2/27th Battalions, it was assigned to the 21st Brigade, which formed part of the 7th Division. The colours chosen for the battalion's unit colour patch (UCP) were the same as those of the 16th Battalion, a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921. These colours were white over dark blue, in a horizontal rectangular shape, although a border of gray in the shape of a diamond was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart.Long 1952, pp. 321‚Äì323. Sailing via India, the 21st Brigade briefly landed at Bombay and constituted for the first time at Deolali, before continuing on to the Middle East.Burns 1960, p. 23. After their arrival in Egypt in late November 1940, the 2/16th moved to Palestine where it continued its training. In February 1941, the 2/16th received a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Alex Bath MacDonald, a Permanent Military Force member. Shortly after this, the battalion was allocated to defend the Egypt‚ÄìLibya border against a possible German attack, and occupied defensive positions. =Syria-Lebanon Campaign= In April 1941, the battalion was transported back to Palestine to take part in Operation Exporter, which was the Allied codename for the Syria-Lebanon Campaign. Commencing in early June 1941, the battalion began offensive actions against Vichy French troops and over the course of the next six weeks fought major actions at the Litani River, Sidon and Damour.James 2017, p. 165. The 2/16th Battalion suffered heavily during the campaign, having 264 casualties; according to the Australian War Memorial, this was the most of any Australian unit that took part in the campaign. In August, Lieutenant Colonel Arnold Potts took over command of the battalion. The unit remained in the Middle East until January 1942, being stationed in Lebanon and forming part of the Allied occupation force that was established following the armistice in mid-July 1941. =New Guinea Campaigns= By early 1942, the Japanese had entered the war, and the Australian government decided to bring some of its troops from the Middle East back to Australia to bolster its defences. The 2/16th embarked at the end of January 1942, and returned to Australia, landing at Adelaide in March 1942 after a brief stopover in Fremantle. A period of reorganisation followed as they were prepared for the hardships of jungle warfare, during which time Potts handed over command of the battalion to Lieutenant Colonel Albert Caro; however, the situation in the Pacific at the time was desperate for the Australians, following Japanese victories in Malaya, Singapore, Rabaul and Ambon,Keogh 1965, pp. 127‚Äì132. and fighting on the Kokoda Track, and so the 2nd AIF troops returning from the Middle East had very little time to prepare for their next campaign. The 2/16th arrived in New Guinea, landing in Port Moresby in mid-August 1942. Later that month it was committed to the battle, and joined the fighting retreat down the Kokoda Track, being rushed into the line around Alola to fill a gap after the 53rd Battalion fell back from Isurava.Brune 2004, p. 143. At the Battle of Mission Ridge in early September it suffered heavy casualties after being encircled by the Japanese and conducting a fighting withdrawal to Imita Ridge. Following its relief in the middle of September, the battalion's surviving members were joined with those from the 2/14th Battalion to form a composite unit temporarily, as the battalion suffered so many casualties in the retreat that it was down to an effective strength of about 200 men; the 2/14th had also suffered heavily.Brune 2004, p. 236. attack on \\"The Pimple\\", Shaggy Ridge, New Guinea. As the tide of the campaign along the Kokoda Track turned towards the Australians, the Japanese withdrew north towards their beachheads around Buna and Gona, with the Australians in pursuit. A brief period of rest and reorganisation followed for the 2/16th during this time, as they were re-constituted before being committed to the Battle of Buna‚ÄìGona in November 1942. Despite the arrival of reinforcements, the battalion could only provide two or its four rifle companies to the fighting, and by early January it was withdrawn, with a strength of only 56 men. The battalion was subsequently rebuilt on the Atherton Tablelands. During this time, the battalion received over 600 reinforcements from the 16th Motor Regiment;Bradley 2004a, p. 148. it also received a new commanding officer in Lieutenant Colonel Frank Sublet, who would subsequently command the battalion for the remainder of the war. In August 1943, the battalion deployed to New Guinea again for its second campaign against the Japanese. Staging out of Port Moresby, in early September the 7th Division was flown into Nadzab, and the 2/16th supported operations to capture Lae. After this, it was air transported to Kaiapit, where from late September it took part in the advance up the Markham Valley towards Dumpu. As the division pushed through the Ramu Valley and then moved into the Finisterre Range, the 2/16th undertook a series of patrols and advances, but experienced only minor actions. These culminated in a significant action around Shaggy Ridge on 27‚Äì28 December, when it conducted an assault on a position dubbed \\"The Pimple\\".Bradley 2004b, pp. 22‚Äì27. In January 1944, at the conclusion of the campaign, the battalion was withdrawn to Port Moresby, and returned to Australia in late March. =Borneo and disbandment= After returning to Australia, the battalion spent over a year training for its final campaign ‚Äì the Borneo campaign ‚Äì which came in the final months of the war. After staging out of Morotai Island, on 1 July the battalion took part in the amphibious landing at Balikpapan. Its most significant actions of the Borneo campaign were fought on the first day of this operation, as the 21st Brigade landed on Green Beach, on the right of the lodgement and then advanced east along the coast, tasked with capturing Sepinggang and the airfield at Manggar.Keogh 1965, pp. 457‚Äì460. Nevertheless, after the initial fighting the battalion continued aggressive patrolling until the end of hostilities in mid-August 1945. Following the war's end the 2/16th Battalion occupied the Celebes before being repatriated to Australia for demobilisation in early 1946. The 2/16th Battalion was disbanded in February 1946 while camped in Brisbane, Queensland. Throughout its service a total of 3,275 men served with the battalionJohnston 2005, p. 248. which suffered 671 casualties, of which 223 were killed or died from wounds, accident or disease. Members of the battalion received the following decorations: three Distinguished Service Orders, six Military Crosses with two Bars, five Distinguished Conduct Medals, 20 Military Medals with one Bar and 63 Mentions in Despatches; in addition, one member of the battalion was appointed as a Member of the Order of the British Empire. Battle honours The 2/16th Battalion received 21 battle and theatre honours: * North Africa, Syria 1941, Syrian Frontier, The Litani, Wadi Zeini, Damour, South-West Pacific 1942‚Äì1945, Kokoda Trail, Isurava, Eora Creek‚ÄìTempleton's Crossing I, Efogi‚ÄìMenari, Ioribaiwa, Buna‚ÄìGona, Gona, Amboga River, Lae‚ÄìNadzab, Liberation of Australian New Guinea, Ramu Valley, Shaggy Ridge, Borneo 1945, Balikpapan.

Plot outline In the Republic of Chaingrath, located in northern Thailand, a little princess named \\"Seangfarng\\" is abandoned by her mother amid an argument over the princess' nationality. Seangfarng is then placed in the care of her father The King of Chaingrath and she later leaves Chaingrath for Bangkok to study, as well as to reunite with her mother, who now has a new family‚Äîthe princess plans to reunite with her mother, even though she had made a commitment to her mother that they would not meet again. Ten years later, Seangfarng, the beauty of Chaingrath, transforms herself into beautiful high school girl Ngam Sanluang to hide her real identity from her mother, who is now searching for her. Also, the death of the princess' father provided her with an insight into the \\"Silamanee\\", Chaingrath's most precious object (a \\"Silamanee\\" is a sacred thing that is traditionally passed down as a marriage gift by the ruler of Chaingrath). The Silamanee has gone missing in Chaingrath due to an arrangement between the king and his closest friend Khun Ruj; however, the Silamanee can be returned to Chaingrath if problems arise in regard to the arrangement‚Äîthe return of the Silamanee is of the utmost importance to Seangfarng/Ngam and she is provided with the address of the object's location. The princess then plans to take back the Silamanee, an object that she believes rightfully belongs to her country. With the help of her friend Chalee (the youngest son of Rachasena), who also has a crush on her, Seangfarng/Ngam visits the address where the Silamanee is located. The princess meets a character named \\"Parote\\" at the address and she subsequently realizes that Parote is a member of her own family. \\"Parote\\" is working in Thai politics, but is also studying, and is the first son of the family. He knows nothing about the princess' true identity, but he directly shows his dislike of the princess towards Seangfarng/Ngam. Seangfarng/Ngam then disguises herself as a beautiful shopkeeper named Mae Liang and charms Parote when he arrives in her shop for silk that has been sourced from Chiang Rai. The new disguise is part of the princess' second plan to assume three identities to successfully deceive Parote. However, Seangfarng/Ngam's plan to deceive Parote flounders and it not only becomes apparent that he is actually in love with the princess, but that he also knows the true location of the Silamanee. It also becomes clear that Parote already knew the princess' real identity and that he previously wished to marry Seangfarng/Ngam; however, both characters are already engaged to other people. With the help of friends and family, Parote and Seangfarng/Ngam eventually marry in Chaingrath; however, the new couple relocate to Bangkok due to problems in the princess' home republic. The soap opera then concludes with the return of the Silamanee to Chaingrath, where Seangfarng/Ngam and Parote have returned to assume the roles of King and Queen of Chaingrath.

Characters *Suvanant Kongying (Kob) as \\"Princess Saengfarng/Ngam Saenluang/Mae Liang\\"‚Äîthe princess of Chiangrath: the only daughter of King Saenluang, the character is sweet and beautiful in the traditional Lanna style; she also possesses a splendid gracefulness, pride and intelligence. However, she is ultimately lonely and seeks the love from her mother that she never received. It is the character's duty to take care of the Chiangrath Province and to return the Silamanee gem stone back to its home. The character transforms herself into an alias, \\"Ngam Saenluang\\" (a Political Science student whose background is unknown), to regain the gem stone, while the young, beautiful \\"Mae Liang\\" is another alias of the character. The princess' also seeks to prove her dignity and love to the man who she is betrothed to and this becomes her most difficult task. *Pattarapon Sinlapajan (Paul) as \\"Parote Rachasena\\": a good-looking man who has everything, including an old \\"blue-blooded\\" (hi-so) family‚Äîhis father is a general and holds a diploma in the discipline of diplomatic. The character works in the Foreign Affairs Commission that operates across different countries. He has a friendly personality, is outgoing and is charming.

Jao loves Princess Saengfarng, but he can only be an older brother to her as they are closely related. Jao is aware of how Saengfarng feels and who she actually loves, and points out to the princess that she needs to decrease her pride to connect with the truth of her heart. *Jaturawit Kochanuam (Uthen) as \\"Lieutenant Colonel Atisak\\": a young soldier with a promising future, the character is fun and amusing. Atisak is Parote's friend and is also associated with the princess' alias Mae Liang. Atisak is responsible for convincing Parote to meet with Mae Liang. *Sompope Benjatikul as \\"King Saenluang Na Chiangrath\\": the Great King of Chaingrath is the perfect father of Princess Searngfarng who raised his daughter alone without the support of his wife.

Silamanee (jewellery) The Silamanee in the remake is stylistically different from the gem stone in the original version. The necklace in the original version contains a large bold circle with three dangling droplet-shaped emeralds, while the stone in the remake consists of five dangling emeralds‚Äîtwo rectangular, two square-shaped and one droplet- shaped. Both versions are green in appearance. With the director's approval, a famous Thai jeweller Kun Chuchai designed the necklace with a Victorian influence.

Accessed 27 December 2008 Chaingrath Chaingrath is a fictional location that was created for the purpose of the lakorn. However, the culture and tradition that appears on Silamanee was based on the city of Chiang Mai; for example, the celebration of the Loy Krathong festival is used as the inspiration for one of the show's scenes. Chiang Mai is the largest and most culturally significant city in northern Thailand. The concept of Chaingrath was also influenced by Lanna, an ancient kingdom that was located in the area around Chiang Mai.

It may have any aspect ratio and may or may not be swept.Application #43. Trapezoidal High-Lift Wing, FUN3D (Fully Unstructured Navier-Stokes), NASA (retrieved 30 November 2015)Ilan Kroo ; AA241 Aircraft Design: Synthesis and Analysis Wing Geometry Definitions , Stanford University. (retrieved 30 November 2015)G. Dimitriadis; Aircraft Design Lecture 2: Aerodynamics, Universit√© de Li√®ge. (retrieved 30 November 2015) The thin, unswept, short- span, low-aspect-ratio trapezoidal configuration offers some advantages for high-speed flight and has been used on a small number of aircraft types. In this wing configuration the leading edge sweeps back and the trailing edge sweeps forward.Gunston, Bill. Jane's Aerospace Dictionary. London, England. Jane's Publishing Company Ltd, 1980. , Page 436. It can provide low aerodynamic drag at high speeds, while maintaining high strength and stiffness, and was used successfully during the early days of supersonic aircraft. Design principles Any wing with straight leading and trailing edges and with differing root and tip chords is a trapezoid, whether or not it is swept.Tom Benson; Wing Area, NASA (retrieved 30 November 2015) The area A of such a trapezoidal wing may be calculated from the span s, root chord cr and tip chord ct: ::A = s \\\\frac{c_r + c_t}{2} The wing loading w is then given by the lift L divided by the area: ::w=\\\\frac{L}{A} In level flight, the amount of lift is equal to the gross weight. In a straight trapezoidal wing, such as on the Bell X-1, the thickest part of the wing along its span, the line of maximum chord, runs straight out sideways from root to tip. The leading edge then sweeps backwards and the trailing edge sweeps forward. In a swept trapezoidal wing, the line of maximum chord is swept at an angle, usually forward. This increases the sweep of the leading edge and decreases the sweep of the trailing edge, and in the extreme case both edges sweep backwards by different amounts. The transition form, where the trailing edge is straight, is equivalent to a cropped delta planform. High-speed trapezoidal wing Douglas X-3 Stiletto At supersonic speeds a thin, small and highly loaded wing offers substantially lower drag than other configurations. Low span and an unswept, tapered planform reduce structural stresses, allowing the wing to be made thin. For minimum drag, wing loading can be in excess of . Early examples provided a solution to the problem of supersonic flight when engine power was limited. They were made so thin that they had to be machined from a thick, solid sheet of metal.Miller, J.; The X-Planes, Speciality Press, 1983. Even with this low-drag wing the Douglas X-3 Stiletto was too underpowered to reach its design flight speed of Mach 2, but the design of its simple hexagonal- airfoil wing was developed for various other X-planes and for Lockheed's widely produced F-104 Starfighter Mach 2.2 high-altitude interceptor. The small wing of the Starfighter was found to have good gust response at low level, providing a smooth ride at high subsonic speeds. Consequently, the type was adopted for the ground-attack role, notably by the German Luftwaffe. However the high loading of the wing resulted in a high stalling speed with marginal take-off and landing characteristics and a corresponding high level of takeoff and landing accidents. A variant with a curved airfoil, blunt trailing edge and conventional internal structure was developed for the North American X-15 rocket plane. Lockheed continued to use the basic design on many of its aircraft proposals in the 1950s, including the Lockheed CL-400 Suntan and early versions of their supersonic transport designs. = High-speed examples = Lockheed F-104 Starfighter ;X-planes * Douglas X-3 Stiletto * Lockheed X-7 * North American X-15 * Lockheed X-27 project. ;Military planes * Lockheed F-104 Starfighter  See also  * Sweep theory References ;Notes Category:Wing configurations Category:Aircraft wing design ","title":"Trapezoidal wing"},{"id":"20134315","title":"Outside of Me"},{"id":"20134324","text":"Ren√© Vignal (12 August 1926 ‚Äì 21 November 2016) was a French footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

He was also called \\"El-ƒ∞m√¢d√Æ\\" because his family was from Im√¢d, a village near Iskilip. Ebussuud was the son of Iskilipli Sheikh Muhiddin Muhammad Efendi. In the 1530s, Ebussuud served as judge in Bursa, Istanbul and Rumelia, where he brought local laws into conformity with Islamic divine law (sharia). Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent promoted him to Shaykh al-IslƒÅm ‚Äì supreme judge and highest official ‚Äì in 1545, an office Ebussuud held until his death and which he brought to the peak of its power.Schneider, 192. He worked closely with the Sultan, issuing judicial opinions that legitimised Suleiman's killings of Yazidis and his successor Selim's attack on Cyprus. Ebussuud also issued fatwƒÅs which labeled the Qizilbash, regardless of whether they lived on Iranian or Ottoman soil, as \\"heretics\\", and declared that killing them would be viewed as praiseworthy, other than just being allowed according to law. Together with Suleiman, the \\"Lawgiver\\", Ebussuud reorganized Ottoman jurisprudence and brought it under tighter governmental control, creating a legal framework joining sharia and the Ottoman administrative code (qƒÅn≈´n). While the previously prevailing opinion held that judges were free to interpret sharia, the law that even the ruler was subject to, Ebussuud instituted a framework in which the judicial power was derived from the Sultan and which compelled judges to follow the Sultan's qƒÅn≈´n-nƒÅmes, \\"law-letters\\", in their application of the law. In addition to his judicial reforms, Ebussuud is also remembered for the great variety of fatwƒÅs he issued. His opinions allowing Karag√∂z plays and the consumption of coffee, a novelty at the time, are particularly celebrated.Schneider, 193.

Background of ENAWU The establishment of this network was funded by the Anna Lindh Foundation, the German development organization Misereor, and others. The network was launched on June 5, 2008 by Prince Hassan bin Talal in Jordan. Project directors are Cornelis Hulsman and Sawsan Gabra Ayoub Khalil. The Objective of ENAWU ENAWU aims to foster relations and dialogue between Muslims and non-Muslims by providing access to accurate, credible, and reliable information for use by scholars, diplomats, journalists, students, other researchers and general users. Improving public understanding of the contemporary Islamic world in non-Muslim countries and, similarly, improving public understanding of the contemporary non-Muslim world in Islamic countries can be accomplished by strengthening, improving and expanding reporting. Reporting that will necessarily include analysis of Arab-West cultural issues, religious issues, and other key factors that involve civil society in the Arab world and the West. ENAWU aims at changing the ways in which sensitive topics involving people belonging to other cultures or religions are discussed, stressing the need to refrain from polemics, exaggerations, and other forms of distortion. The ENAWU portal uses the Arab-West Report as a springboard for discussions, recently encouraging interactive online forum discussions on the controversial film 'Fitna' by Dutch MP Geert Wilders. History Dutch sociologist Cornelis Hulsman moved with his Egyptian wife Sawsan Gabra Ayoub Khalil in 1994 to Egypt where they discovered large discrepancies between various (Western) media reporting and what they actually found in Egypt after thorough investigations of various topics reported in media. It became clear that many of the complexities in society and context were insufficiently explained for audiences that generally have little knowledge about Egyptian society. This made Cornelis Hulsman initiate the Religious News Service from the Arab World in 1997. In 2003 the name was changed to Arab-West Report. The data include summary translations from Arabic media, investigative reporting, interviews with major actors. The focus was always non-partisan and never only on tensions or dialogue only. The aim was to give a full overview of the complexity of different convictions in Egyptian society. Arab-West Report was until 2005 the personal initiative of Cornelis Hulsman and Sawsan Gabra Ayoub Khalil. The Center for Intercultural Dialogue and Translation (CIDT), an Egyptian not for profit company founded in 2005, the Arab-West Foundation in the Netherlands, an NGO founded in 2005 and the Center for Arab-West Understanding, an Egyptian NGO founded in 2007 were established to continue this work and work together on building and expanding the Arab-West Report electronic database with a thorough search system that provides readers with rapid insights into different ways of thinking and reporting from what most audiences are used to seeing. In 2007/2008, the Anna Lindh Foundation agreed to provide the necessary financial support that actualized the ENAWU project. Prior to that Arab-West Report was built without a standard platform and the databases of participating organizations were distributed on different platforms. In 2008, a portal was developed to link the web-based resources and archives belonging to 15 organizations. These were the organizations that had demonstrated commitment to aspects like intercultural, inter-faith, and dialogue-based activities. The essence of having the portal as searchable as possible was to make it easy for the specific users to access, retrieve, and share information which would be contributing to better understand issues as reported in contemporary media. Key to the ENAWU project was enhancing the search functions. CIDT developed an indexation system based on the Dewey classification system that university libraries worldwide use. Through this a user can search for topics and see how topics are related to each other. The purpose is showing users that reported items never stand on their own but must be understood in their wider context. Through the ENAWU project CIDT standardized the transliteration of Arabic names. This was a major headache since none of the participating organizations used the same transliteration system for Arabic names. The participating organizations realized that standardization in one organization is already difficult but that across different organizations it is even more difficult. The ENAWU project created a very elaborate tagging system to all data online, including names of authors, names of people and organizations mentioned in texts, references of authors to Bible and Qur‚Äôan, which helped organizations in Egypt to make a convincing argument against the film Fitna of Geert Wilders in March 2008 . ENAWU used the Arab-West Report as a springboard for discussions, on the controversial film 'Fitna' by Dutch MP Geert Wilders[3] and a petition of Egyptian church and Muslim leaders to Dutch Parliament . This resulted in the formation of the Dutch Cairo Committee which consists of representatives of different Christian denominations, Muslim organizations. Later Dutch Jewish organizations joined. Again later the Committee changed its name in Overleg Joden, Christenen, Moslims (OJCM), Consultation Jews, Christians, Muslims. ENAWU created a hierarchical system for location names (country, governorate, district and smallest administrative units) and linked this to articles in the Arab-West Report database. This makes the search system in particular useful to rapidly discover context to any issue that pops up in the media and thus rapidly quell conspiracy theories and other distortions. The portal was developed to provide avenues and facilities for participation of all users. The individual registered users, registered organizations, and other casual visitors could readily search, collaborate and communicate while using the portal. As mentioned above, the essence of developing the system in the manner noted was to enhance sharing and collaboration using the information. Having a database that had access to the various other electronically stored data was a significant step in realizing the objectives of ENAWU. As such, the portal developed was created to support the initial supportive organizations, as well as to scale and support a growing number of network partners, members, individuals associated and other entities. The development of the database went hand-in-hand with the development of student internships. Through the database in particular they became aware how complex many reported issues are that they we should refrain from making rapid judgements. Many students reported that realities in interfaith relations are far more complex then what they had read in books during their studies. Thanks to the Electronic Network for Arab-West Understanding project it became much easier for students to build on the experiences and work of previous students. Students became increasingly important to add content to the database, promoted this through social media and other channels. A key characteristic became the tremendous variety in nationalities at any given point in time. Students love this mix between Egyptians and non-Egyptians of tens of different nationalities. The program became crucial in enabling and developing the next crop of leaders both for the Middle East and Europe. Due to its advantage of enabling the interns to work and collaborate in a multicultural environment while contributing to the goals of ENAWU, the interns were exposed to real issues affecting the Middle East, and how they could help in the furtherance of ENAWU‚Äôs objectives as well as similar initiatives from other stakeholders. Furthermore, the interns‚Äô insights are noted to have played a pertinent role in the realization of the goals of the project. The database has become a major tool for students and researchers. A substantial number of PhD researchers have used Arab-West Report for their theses. This shows the influence Arab-West Report has on scholarly work related to the role of convictions (religious and secular) in society. Many Muslim and non-Muslim organizations became increasingly interested in the improvement of knowledge- sharing and positive relations both in the West and the Arab world. Other users of the portal include businesspeople, civil society groups and policymakers. Another part of the portal development was the newsletter. The newsletter was to cover topics that are central to Muslim Christianity relations in the Arab world, highlighting various student activities and would be used as a significant communication tool for ENAWU. The ENAWU project provided the basis for the ZIVIK Peace Building project in 2010, funded by the Institut f√ºr Auslandsbeziehungen, Germany. The documents that were produced during the ZIVIK project (and later other projects) have all been added to the Arab-West Report database and are fully searchable. The original aim was to collect data from different Arab countries and Europe to make this accessible in different languages, including English and Arabic. Financial restrictions made the three organizations concentrate on the Arab-West Report database that is now primarily focused on the role of religion in Egyptian society. In this way the Arab-West Report has become a major and effective hub for Muslim- Christian understanding in Egypt and an example of how this could be set up in other countries as well. In 2010 it became necessary for CIDT, the leading partner in the ENAWU project, to have a rallying call. The mission statement, set of goals, and methods to be used were defined with support of Dutch consultancy bureau MDF and adopted and ratified into the Strategic Report of October 28, 2010. The mission statement became ‚Äúto be a non-partisan organisation that contributes to the peaceful coexistence of religious groups in Egypt,‚Äù which has remained unchanged since then. The keywords are non- partisan, peaceful coexistence of religious groups and Egypt. CIDT is of opinion that country-based organizations should not try to be involved in other countries. For this reason, CIDT welcomes cooperation with similar minded organizations in other countries. In 2013, catastrophe happened. As part of the political upheavals in Egypt that saw the ouster of President Morsi from power, the core databases of the portal were destroyed. The works on it were temporarily halted and the disaster was subsequently investigated by Dutch company Digital Investigation. The findings were that the attacks were deliberate, these were careful attempts to destroy the gains that the project had realized. The database has been rebuilt since then with precautions through daily back-ups that this cannot happen again. Prof. Dr. Wolfram Reiss, head of the Department of Systematic Theology and the Study of Religions at the University of Vienna, gave Arab-West Report in 2012 a platform that would include substantial contributions of our student interns which gave many of them a first opportunity to contribute to academic publishing. This resulted in three academic books (part of the series of Anwendungsorientierte Religionswissenschaften [application oriented religious studies] of Tectum Publishers in Germany) about the Egyptian revolution and its aftermath. The books offered new perspectives into the events and outcomes of the uprising. Practically all interviews could be recorded and have been fully transcribed for placement in Arab-West Report which is an absolute fascinating source of information for anyone who wants to understand the complexities of the revolution and its aftermath. The books were praised by Islamists and non-Islamists alike. The forewords of the second and third book were written by H.E. Ambassador Mona Omar and H.E. Amr Moussa in his capacity as former president of the Constituent Assembly of 2014. Between January 2016 and January 2017, for one year, the Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS) of the combined Dutch universities and affiliated research institutions helped transform the collected data into datasets. The datasets were then uploaded to the DANS database. The DANS database was crucial for widening the reach of the database, particularly to academic communities. Arab-West Report became the basis for the 2018 Intercultural Summer School which was organized by the Center for Arab-West Understanding (CAWU) and Heliopolis University for Sustainable Development. In 2019 the Center for Arab-West Understanding organized a second Intercultural Summer School but this time in cooperation with the Anglican Diocese of Egypt, Al-Azhar Center for Interreligious Dialogue at the Azhar University and Ain Shams University. The summer schools attracted university students from Egypt, Tunisia, Europe and other parts of the world, including students of many different world-views which was intended since only such diversity and encounters can foster real dialogue. Appraisal The database has been frequently highly praised for this effectiveness. It involves students worldwide, it gives students, Egyptian and non-Egyptian, an opportunity to learn about intercultural complexities and how to deal with this in an unprecedented way. The database is used by people worldwide and as Dr. Peter O‚ÄôBrien, an Irish economist working with the EU noted, ‚ÄúLike many crucial problems of conflict and the search for understanding, issues of Arab/West Understanding suffer acutely from the NON SUSTAINABILITY OF MEMORY. Your work, especially the stock of material, makes a vital contribution to sustaining accurate memory. I believe this is not an academic comment, but a vital selling point.‚Äù The database has been praised by prominent people as HRH Prince el-Hassan bin Talal of Jordan, Prof. Andreas van Agt, Prime Minister of the Netherlands, 1977-1082, Lord Dr. George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury, 1991-2002, Dr. Hamdi Zaqzouq, Egyptian Minister of Endowments, 1995-2011, Amr Moussa, Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs, 1991-2001, Secretary General of the League of Arab States, 2001-2011, candidate in the Egyptian Presidential elections in 2012 and chairman of the Egyptian Constituent Assembly in 2013 and many others, including academics, human rights workers, journalists, representatives of NGOs, politicians, religious leaders and diplomats https://www.arabwestreport.info/en/letters- recommendation https://www.arabwestreport.info/en/letters-recommendation References Category:2008 establishments in Jordan Category:International organizations based in the Middle East Category:Mass media in the Middle East ","title":"Electronic Network for Arab-West Understanding"},{"id":"20134583","text":"Felipe Monteiro Diogo (born 17 July 1988), known as Sodinha, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for Italian Serie C club Modena.

He is notable for his opposition to the faction of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, and for his patronage of complex acrostic and allegorical poetry that anticipated the Metaphysical movement. Life Salusbury was a member of the Salusbury family of Lleweni in the Vale of Clwyd, Denbighshire, where they owned a considerable estate, including Lleweni Hall. Various members of the family acquired honours and appointments through their support of the Tudor monarchs. He was the son of Sir John Salusbury and Katheryn of Berain, and the younger brother of Thomas Salusbury, who was executed in 1586 for his involvement in the Babington Plot against Elizabeth I. He was born in 1567 and educated at Jesus College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1581 aged 14. After his brother's execution, he succeeded to the estates, but the family's lands were severely reduced due to the loss of crown leases. It took him several years to restore them. He studied law at the Middle Temple from March 1595. Elizabeth appointed him as squire of the body in the same year. Salusbury became noted for his \\"ostentatious loyalty\\" to the queen, in contrast to other members of his family, who were associated with Catholic sympathies and plots against her. Salusbury was a staunch Protestant, writing to the queen's minister, Robert Cecil denouncing recusants. He was also an opponent of the Earl of Essex, with whose supporters he came into conflict in local politics. He almost killed his cousin Owen, an Essex supporter, in a sword fight in 1593. Owen was already being treated with suspicion as a potential rebel, so the duel did Salusbury no harm. The 5th Earl of Derby, his wife's brother, wrote to congratulate him for beating \\"that bad fellow of your name\\", saying that the event would be to the \\"advancement of your credit\\".The History of Parliament: SALUSBURY, Sir John After the Essex Rebellion, on 14 June 1601, Salusbury was knighted for his support in suppressing it. His cousins Owen and John were implicated in the rebellion, Owen being killed in the fighting. These conflicts led to the \\"Wrexham riot\\" in October 1601, during an election to parliament, in which Salusbury's supporters engaged in violent clashes with the surviving Essex supporters led by Sir Richard Trevor. Salusbury complained to the queen about intimidation. After a recount, he was declared the winner of the election.James P. Bednarz, Shakespeare and the Truth of Love: The Mystery of \\"The Phoenix and Turtle\\", p. 66. He became MP for Denbighshire in December 1601, but only took his seat for a few days before parliament was dissolved. After Elizabeth's death, Essex's surviving supporters returned to favour at the court of her successor James I. Thereafter, Salusbury spent little time in London, with his enemies attempting to discredit him at court. He died on 24 July 1612. Family Salusbury married Ursula Stanley, the illegitimate daughter of Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby and Jane Halsall, in 1586. Their first child, Jane, was born on 6 October 1586. The couple went on to have ten children, of which six survived to adulthood: four girls and two boys. His son, Henry Salusbury, succeeded him. Henry became the first of the Salusbury Baronets in 1619. Literature The title page of Chester's Love's Martyr, dedicated to Salusbury Salusbury was a poet and patron of literature. Several works were dedicated to him. In 1595 Henry Perry dedicated his book of Welsh grammar Egluryn Ffraethineb to Salusbury. Sinetes Passions (1597) a collection of verse by Robert Parry, was also dedicated to Salusbury. The most important work linked to Salusbury is Robert Chester's book Love's Martyr, which is dedicated to Sir John. Both Parry and Chester seem to have been local Denbighshire writers who formed part of Salusbury's own circle. Salusbury's own poetry may have been published in Parry's collection in the section entitled the \\"patron's pathetical posies\\", though this has been disputed.G. Blakemore Evans, The Poems of Robert Parry, Tempe, Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2005, pp. 10‚Äì22. These include a complex symbolic poem addressed to his sister-in-law, Dorothy Halsall. Other sonnets and love lyrics of his exist in manuscripts. Chester was probably Salusbury's chaplain or secretary. His long and extremely obscure allegory about a phoenix and turtledove has led to several conflicting interpretations. The most common are that it symbolises either the love of John and Ursula, or alternatively the idealised relationship between Sir John and Queen Elizabeth.John Klause, \\"The Phoenix and the Turtle in its Time\\", in Gwynne Blakemore Evans (ed), In the Company of Shakespeare: Essays on English Renaissance Literature, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 2002, pp. 206-227. Chester's poem contains a series of \\"Cantos\\" at the end of the allegory. William Empson argues that the \\"Cantos\\" are by Salusbury, as they are similar in style to those appended to Robert Parry's book, displaying Salusbury's \\"very recognisable facility and ingenuity\\".William Empson, Essays on Shakespeare, Cambridge University Press, 1986, p. 27. E. A. J. Honigmann argues that Salusbury had a fascination with \\"mystical verse\\" which contained obscure acrostic puzzles, and that his patronage explains the unique metaphysical symbolism of Parry's, Chester's and his own verse.E. A. J. Honigmann, Shakespeare: The Lost Years, Manchester University Press, 1998, p. 93 Salusbury also seems to have been acquainted with Ben Jonson, who may have been the person responsible for organising a group of important poets to contribute verses to supplement Chester's poems. Among these were Jonson himself, John Marston, George Chapman and William Shakespeare, who contributed The Phoenix and the Turtle.Another possibility is that Marston was the person who brought the others together. Cathcart, Charles, Marston, Rivalry, Rapprochement, and Jonson, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2008, p. 20. These poems share the imagery of Love's Martyr and Salusbury's typical elusive and complex allegorising.

The town of Cashel was held by the Irish Catholic Confederate's Munster army and was besieged and taken by an English Protestant Parliamentarian army under Murrough O'Brien the Baron of Inchiquin. The attack and subsequent sack of Cashel was one of the more brutal incidents of the wars of the 1640s in Ireland. The Munster mutiny The Sack of Cashel occurred against the background of a complex conflict in the south of Ireland. In 1642, most of the province of Munster had fallen to Irish Catholic rebels with the exception of Cork city and a few towns along the south coast, which remained in the hands of Protestants, largely English settlers. For five years, the province had been fought over by the Irish Confederation and Protestants, led by the Earl of Inchiquin. The political and military situation was further fragmented by the English Civil War in which the Catholics gave their support to King Charles I, and the Protestants after 1643 to the English Parliament. What was more, the Irish Confederates were themselves split over the terms on which they should sign a peace deal with the King. A deep rift developed within their ranks in 1647 between those who were prepared to accept a mere toleration of Catholicism in return for an alliance with the English Royalists and those who in effect wanted Ireland to be a Catholic kingdom, albeit under sovereignty of the Stuart monarchy. This infighting was to fatally hamper the war effort of the Confederates in Munster and make possible the Protestant sack of Cashel. On 12 June 1647 Donough MacCarthy, the Viscount of Muskerry entered the camp of the Irish Confederate Munster army. The Viscount Muskerry was probably the most powerful Confederate leader in Munster and was known to be sympathetic to the powerful Irish Royalist Ormonde. At that time, the Munster army was commanded by the Earl of Glamorgan, an English Catholic nobleman who had been granted command of the army by the Confederate Supreme council for reasons of political expediency, being aligned neither to the Royalist nor clerical faction. Glamorgan was not popular, partly because he was English but also because he lacked money to regularly pay the soldiers. Muskerry was unsatisfied with the direction the Irish Confederate Supreme Council was headed under the influence of Rinuccinni and realised that he was in a position to influence the army of Munster and thereby strengthen his hand. He won the army over within an hour. A ceremony was afterwards arranged in which Glamorgan handed over command to Muskerry but this was merely to save face. Muskerry desired to turn his full attention to the politics of the Irish Confederations supreme council, and so immediately after the ceremony, Muskerry resigned in favour of Theobald Taaffe, a nobleman who had joined the Irish Confederates but who was known to be sympathetic to Royalism. Unfortunately for the Confederates, Lord Taaffe would subsequently prove to be one of the most incompetent leaders to command an Irish army during the 1640s. Even worse, while the Munster Army was paralysed by the intrigues of its commanders, Inchiquin's Protestant forces had embarked on a highly destructive campaign in Confederate held territory. Inchiquin's offensive In the summer of 1647 the Baron Inchiquin, the Irish Protestant commander of the Protestant army of Cork, commenced a campaign against the Irish Catholic strongholds in Munster. The counties of Limerick and Clare were raided and he soon turned his attention to the bountiful eastern counties of Munster. In early September, his forces quickly took the Castle of Cahir in Tipperary. This strong castle was well positioned to become a base for the Cork Protestant army, and it was used to raid and devastate the surrounding countryside. The Munster army under Lord Taaffe did not make any serious effort to oppose Inchiquin, probably the result of the political scheming of Muskerry and other powerful Irish lords who hoped to keep the Munster army intact for their own ends. As such, Inchiquin was allowed to make a major push towards the town and ecclesiastical centre of Cashel. The attack Inchiquin had already launched two minor raids against Cashel, and he now had the opportunity to launch a major assault. The Parliamentarian forces first stormed nearby Roche Castle, putting fifty warders to the sword. This attack terrified the local inhabitants of the region, some of whom fled to hiding places, while hundreds of others fled promptly to the Rock of Cashel, a stronger place than the town itself. Lord Taaffe had placed six companies in the fortified churchyard that sat upon the rock, and considered the place defensible, though he himself did not stay to put it to the test, leaving command to the Governor Lieutenant-Colonel Butler. Arriving with his army at the Rock, Inchiquin called for surrender within an hour. The defenders of the churchyard offered to negotiate, but that was refused, and on the afternoon of 15 September the assault commenced. The Parliamentarians were first reminded of earlier atrocities against Protestants, and then began to deploy. The attack was led by around 150 dismounted horse officers (who wore more armour than the foot) with the remainder of the infantry following; troops of horse rode along the flanks of the advancing force to encourage the infantry. The Irish soldiers attempted to drive off the attackers with pikes while the civilians inside hurled rocks down from the walls: in turn the attackers hurled firebrands into the compound, setting some of the buildings inside on fire. Although many were wounded, the Parliamentarians gradually fought their way over the walls, pushing the garrison into the church. Initially, the Irish defenders managed to protect the Church, holding off the attackers trying to get through the doors, but the Parliamentarians then placed numerous ladders against the many windows in the church and swarmed the building. For another half an hour fighting raged inside the church, until the depleted defenders retreated up the bell tower. Only sixty soldiers of the garrison remained at this point, and they thus accepted a call to surrender. However, after they had descended the tower and thrown their swords away, all were killed. The sack In the end all the soldiers (save a single major) and most of the civilians on the Rock were killed by the attackers. The Bishop and Mayor of Cashel along with a few others survived by taking shelter in a secret hiding place. Apart from these a few women were spared, after being stripped of their clothes, and a small number of wealthy civilians were taken prisoner, but these were the exceptions. Overall, close to 1,000 were killed, amongst them Lieutenant-Colonel Butler and catholic scholar Theobald Stapleton. The bodies in the churchyard were described by a witness as being five or six deep. The slaughter was followed by extensive plunder. There was much of value inside, for apart from pictures, chalices and vestments of the church, many of the slain civilians had also brought their valuables with them. The sword and mace of the mayor of Cashel, as well as the coach of the bishop were captured. The plunder was accompanied by acts of iconoclasm, with statues smashed and pictures defaced. The deserted town of Cashel was also torched. Aftermath The atrocity at Cashel caused a deep impact in Ireland, as it was the worst single atrocity committed in Ireland since the start of fighting in 1641. Previously, the most infamous massacre amongst the Catholic population was that at Timolin in 1643, when 200 civilians were killed by Ormonde's English Royalist army, but many more than this were killed at Cashel, and the Rock of Cashel was one of the chief holy places of Ireland. The slaughter of the garrison at Cashel and the subsequent devastation of Catholic-held Munster earned Inchiquin the Irish nickname, Murchadh na D√≥ite√°in or \\"Murrough of the Burnings\\". The political ramifications in the Irish confederation were also profound, serving to exacerbate the split between the Catholic party headed by Giovanni Battista Rinuccini and those sympathetic to the Royalist lord Ormonde. The former were enraged by the attack, and desired retribution against Inchiquin and his army, but the Ormondist faction saw the Sack of Cashel and a subsequent raid by Inchiquin's men into County Kilkenny as evidence of the futility of defending Ireland without Royalist support. In the short term, Lord Taffe came under intense pressure from the Confederate leadership to engage Inchiquin. When he did so in November, the politically divided and badly led Munster army was routed and destroyed at the Battle of Knocknanuss. This was the second Confederate army to be destroyed in less than six months, the Leinster Army having been annihilated at the battle of Dungans Hill in August. In consequence, the Confederates had no option but to sign a truce with Inchiquin, an act which deeply alienated many Confederates and Catholic clergy, who had been appalled at Inchiquin's brutal tactics in Munster. These divisions would lead to the brief but bloody Irish Confederate Civil War in 1648. Inchiquin withdrew his support for the English Parliament in the same year and entered with the Confederates into a Royalist alliance. Despite the massacre, Inchiquin converted to Roman Catholicism while in exile in France 1656.

The term may also include Americans of mixed race ancestry who self- identify with just one group culturally and socially (cf. the one-drop rule). In the 2010 US census, approximately 9 million individuals, or 2.9% of the population, self-identified as multiracial. has 6.1 million (2.0%) There is evidence that an accounting by genetic ancestry would produce a higher number. Historical reasons, including slavery creating a racial caste and the European-American suppression of Native Americans, often led people to identify or be classified by only one ethnicity, generally that of the culture in which they were raised.Gates, Henry Louis, Jr. Faces of America: How 12 Extraordinary Americans Reclaimed Their Pasts (New York University Press, 2010) Prior to the mid-20th century, many people hid their multiracial heritage because of racial discrimination against minorities. While many Americans may be considered multiracial, they often do not know it or do not identify so culturally, any more than they maintain all the differing traditions of a variety of national ancestries. After a lengthy period of formal racial segregation in the former Confederacy following the Reconstruction Era and bans on interracial marriage in various parts of the country, more people are openly forming interracial unions. In addition, social conditions have changed and many multiracial people do not believe it is socially advantageous to try to \\"pass\\" as white. Diverse immigration has brought more mixed race people into the United States, such as a significant population of Hispanics identifying as mestizos. Since the 1980s, the United States has had a growing multiracial identity movement (cf. Loving Day).Root, Multiracial Experience, pp. xv‚Äìxviii Because more Americans have insisted on being allowed to acknowledge their mixed racial origins, the 2000 census for the first time allowed residents to check more than one ethno-racial identity and thereby identify as multiracial. In 2008, Barack Obama was elected as the first biracial President of the United States; he acknowledges both sides of his family and identifies as African-American.\\"Obama raises profile of mixed- race Americans\\", San Francisco Chronicle July 21, 2008. Today, multiracial individuals are found in every corner of the country. Multiracial groups in the United States include many African Americans, Hispanic Americans, M√©tis Americans, Louisiana Creoles, Hapas, Melungeons, and several other communities found primarily in the Eastern US. Many Native Americans are multiracial in ancestry while identifying fully as members of federally recognized tribes. History The American people are mostly multi-ethnic descendants of various culturally distinct immigrant groups, many of which have now developed nations. Some consider themselves multiracial, while acknowledging race as a social construct. Creolization, assimilation and integration have been continuing processes. The Civil Rights Movement and other social movements since the mid-twentieth century worked to achieve social justice and equal enforcement of civil rights under the constitution for all ethnicities. In the 2000s, less than 5% of the population identified as multiracial. In many instances, mixed racial ancestry is so far back in an individual's family history (for instance, before the Civil War or earlier), that it does not affect more recent ethnic and cultural identification. Interracial relationships, common-law marriages and marriages occurred since the earliest colonial years, especially before slavery hardened as a racial caste associated with people of African descent in the British colonies. Virginia and other English colonies passed laws in the 17th century that gave children the social status of their mother, according to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, regardless of the father's race or citizenship. This overturned the principle in English common law by which a man gave his status to his children ‚Äì this had enabled communities to demand that fathers support their children, whether legitimate or not. The change increased white men's ability to use slave women sexually, as they had no responsibility for the children. As master as well as father of mixed-race children born into slavery, the men could use these people as servants or laborers or sell them as slaves. In some cases, white fathers provided for their multiracial children, paying or arranging for education or apprenticeships and freeing them, particularly during the two decades following the American Revolution. (The practice of providing for the children was more common in French and Spanish colonies, where a class of free people of color developed who became educated and property owners.) Many other white fathers abandoned the mixed race children and their mothers to slavery. The researcher Paul Heinegg found that most families of free people of color in colonial times were founded from the unions of white women, whether free or indentured servants and African men, slave, indentured or free. In the early years, the working-class peoples lived and worked together. Their children were free because of the status of the white women. This was in contrast to the pattern in the post-Revolutionary era, in which most mixed-race children had white fathers and slave mothers.Paul Heinegg, Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware, 1995‚Äì2010 Anti-miscegenation laws were passed in most states during the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, but this did not prevent white slaveholders, their sons, or other powerful white men from taking slave women as concubines and having multiracial children with them. In California and the western US, there were greater numbers of Latin American and Asian residents. These were prohibited from official relationships with whites. White legislators passed laws prohibiting marriage between European and Asian Americans until the 1950s. =Early United States history= Olaudah Equiano Interracial relationships have had a long history in North America and the United States, beginning with the intermixing of European explorers and soldiers, who took native women as companions. After European settlement increased, traders and fur trappers often married or had unions with women of native tribes. In the 17th century, faced with a continuing, critical labor shortage, colonists primarily in the Chesapeake Bay Colony, imported Africans as laborers, sometimes as indentured servants and, increasingly, as slaves. African slaves were also imported into New York and other northern ports by the Dutch and later English. Some African slaves were freed by their masters during these early years. In the colonial years, while conditions were more fluid, white women, indentured servant or free, and African men, servant, slave or free, made unions. Because the women were free, their mixed-race children were born free; they and their descendants formed most of the families of free people of color during the colonial period in Virginia. The scholar Paul Heinegg found that eighty percent of the free people of color in North Carolina in censuses from 1790‚Äì1810 could be traced to families free in Virginia in colonial years.Paul Heinegg, Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware, 1995‚Äì2012 In 1789 Olaudah Equiano, a former slave from Nigeria who was enslaved in North America, published his autobiography. He advocated interracial marriage between whites and blacks. By the late eighteenth century, visitors to the Upper South noted the high proportion of mixed-race slaves, evidence of miscegenation by white men. In 1790, the first federal population census was taken in the United States. Enumerators were instructed to classify free residents as white or \\"other.\\" Only the heads of households were identified by name in the federal census until 1850. Native Americans were included among \\"Other;\\" in later censuses, they were included as \\"Free people of color\\" if they were not living on Indian reservations. Slaves were counted separately from free persons in all the censuses until the Civil War and end of slavery. In later censuses, people of African descent were classified by appearance as mulatto (which recognized visible European ancestry in addition to African) or black. After the American Revolutionary War, the number and proportion of free people of color increased markedly in the North and the South as slaves were freed. Most northern states abolished slavery, sometimes, like New York, in programs of gradual emancipation that took more than two decades to be completed. The last slaves in New York were not freed until 1827. In connection with the Second Great Awakening, Quaker and Methodist preachers in the South urged slaveholders to free their slaves. Revolutionary ideals led many men to free their slaves, some by deed and others by will, so that from 1782 to 1810, the percentage of free people of color rose from less than one percent to nearly 10 percent of blacks in the South. =19th century: American Civil War, emancipation, Reconstruction and Jim Crow= Charley Taylor holding an American flag. Charley was the son of Alexander Withers and one of Withers's slaves. Withers sold Charley to a slave dealer and he was sold again in New Orleans. Of numerous relationships between male slaveholders, overseers, or master's sons and women slaves, the most notable is likely that of President Thomas Jefferson with his slave Sally Hemings. As noted in the 2012 collaborative Smithsonian-Monticello exhibit, Slavery at Monticello: The Paradox of Liberty, Jefferson, then a widower, took Hemings as his concubine for nearly 40 years. They had six children of record; four Hemings children survived into adulthood, and he freed them all, among the very few slaves he freed. Two were allowed to \\"escape\\" to the North in 1822, and two were granted freedom by his will upon his death in 1826. Seven- eighths white by ancestry, all four of his Hemings children moved to northern states as adults; three of the four entered the white community, and all their descendants identified as white. Of the descendants of Madison Hemings who continued to identify as black, some in future generations eventually identified as white and \\"married out,\\" while others continued to identify as African American. It was socially advantageous for the Hemings children to identify as white, in keeping with their appearance and the majority proportion of their ancestry. Although born into slavery, the Hemings children were legally white under Virginia law of the time. =20th century= Racial discrimination continued to be enacted in new laws in the 20th century, for instance the one-drop rule was enacted in Virginia's 1924 Racial Integrity Law and in other southern states, in part influenced by the popularity of eugenics and ideas of racial purity. People buried fading memories that many whites had multiracial ancestry. Many families were multiracial. Similar laws had been proposed but not passed in the late nineteenth century in South Carolina and Virginia, for instance. After regaining political power in Southern states by disenfranchising blacks, white Democrats passed laws to impose Jim Crow and racial segregation to restore white supremacy. They maintained these until forced to change in the 1960s and after by enforcement of federal legislation authorizing oversight of practices to protect the constitutional rights of African Americans and other minority citizens. In 1967 the United States Supreme Court case, Loving v. Virginia ruled that anti-miscegenation laws were unconstitutional. In the twentieth century up until 1989, social service organizations typically assigned multiracial children to the racial identity of the minority parent, which reflected social practices of hypodescent. Black social workers had influenced court decisions on regulations related to identity; they argued that, as the biracial child was socially considered black, it should be classified that way in order to identify with the group and learn to deal with discrimination. By 1990, the Census Bureau included more than a dozen ethnic/racial categories on the census, reflecting not only changing social ideas about ethnicity, but the wide variety of immigrants who had come to reside in the United States due to changing historical forces and new immigration laws in the 1960s. With a changing society, more citizens have begun to press for acknowledging multiracial ancestry. The Census Bureau changed its data collection by allowing people to self-identify as more than one ethnicity. Some ethnic groups are concerned about the potential political and economic effects, as federal assistance to historically underserved groups has depended on Census data. According to the Census Bureau, as of 2002, over 75% of all African Americans had multiracial ancestries. The proportion of acknowledged multiracial children in the United States is growing. Interracial partnerships are on the rise, as are transracial adoptions. In 1990, around 14% of 18- to 19-year-olds, 12% of 20- to 21-year-olds, and 7% of 34- to 35-year-olds were involved in interracial relationships (Joyner and Kao, 2005). Demographics Multiracial people who wanted to acknowledge their full heritage won a victory of sorts in 1997, when the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) changed the federal regulation of racial categories to permit multiple responses. This resulted in a change to the 2000 United States Census, which allowed participants to select more than one of the six available categories, which were, in brief: \\"White,\\" \\"Black or African- American,\\" \\"Asian,\\" \\"American Indian or Alaskan Native,\\" \\"Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander\\" and \\"Other.\\" Further details are given in the article: Race and ethnicity in the United States Census. The OMB made its directive mandatory for all government forms by 2003. In 2000, Cindy Rodriguez reported on reactions to the new census: Some multiracial individuals feel marginalized by U.S. society. For example, when applying to schools or for a job or when taking standardized tests, Americans are sometimes asked to check boxes corresponding to race or ethnicity. Typically, about five race choices are given, with the instruction to \\"check only one.\\" While some surveys offer an \\"other\\" box, this choice groups together individuals of many different multiracial types (ex: European Americans/African-Americans are grouped with Asian/Native American Indians). The 2000 U.S. Census in the write-in response category had a code listing which standardizes the placement of various write- in responses for automatic placement within the framework of the U.S. Census's enumerated races. Whereas most responses can be distinguished as falling into one of the five enumerated races, there remains some write-in responses which fall into the \\"Mixture\\" heading which cannot be racially categorized. These include \\"Bi Racial, Combination, Everything, Many, Mixed, Multi National, Multiple, Several and Various\\". In 1997, Greg Mayeda, a member of the Board of Directors person for the Hapa Issues Forum, attended a meeting regarding the new racial classifications for the 2000 U.S. Census. He was arguing against a multiracial category and for multiracial people being counted as all of their races. He argued that a > separate Multiracial Box does not allow a person who identifies as mixed > race the opportunity to be counted accurately. After all, we are not just > mixed race. We are representatives of all racial groups and should be > counted as such. A stand alone Multiracial Box reveals very little about the > person's background checking it. US Census reporting of Two or Mixed Races 2010 - 2017 According to James P. Allen and Eugene Turner from California State University, Northridge, who analyzed the 2000 Census, most multiracial people identified as part white. In addition, the breakdown is as follows: * white/Native American and Alaskan Native, at 7,015,017, * white/black at 737,492, * white/Asian at 727,197, and * white/Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander at 125,628. In 2010, 1.6 million Americans checked both \\"black\\" and \\"white\\" on their census forms, a figure 134% higher than the number a decade earlier. The number of interracial marriages and relationships, and transracial and international adoptions has increased the proportion of multiracial families. In addition, more individuals may be identifying multiple ancestries, as the concept is more widely accepted. Multiracial American identity =Political history= Despite a long history of miscegenation within the U.S. political territory and American continental landscape, advocacy for a unique social race classification to recognize direct, or recent, multiracial parentage did not begin until the 1970s. After the Civil Rights Era and rapid integration of African-Americans into predominately European-American institutions and residential communities, it became more socially acceptable for White race identified women to date, marry and procreate children fathered by non-White men. This trend evolved a political push that offspring of interracial unions fully inherit the social race classifications of both parents, regardless of the racial classification of the maternal parent. This advocacy countered what had been practiced in the United States since the 1500s where a newborn's racial classification defaulted to that of their mother which was determined by the One Drop Rule as well as misogyny-driven white supremacist hegemony. Practiced during chattel slavery the rule delegated the racial classification of offspring produced by White male slave masters and African or Negro female slaves through coercion or rape. =Contemporary interracial marriage= In 2009, Keith Bardwell, a justice of the peace in Robert, Louisiana, refused to officiate a wedding for an interracial couple and was summarily sued in federal court. See refusal of interracial marriage in Louisiana. About 15% of all new marriages in the United States in 2010 were between spouses of a different race or ethnicity from one another, more than double the share in 1980 (6.7%). =Multiracial families and identity issues= Given the variety of the familial and general social environments in which multiracial children are raised, along with the diversity of their appearance and heritage, generalizations about multiracial children's challenges or opportunities are not very useful. A 1989 article written by Charlotte Nitary revealed that parents of mixed raced children often struggled between teaching their children to identify as only the race of their non-white parent, not identifying with social race at all, or identifying with the racial identities of both parents. The social identity of children and of their parents in the same multiracial family may vary or be the same. Some multiracial children feel pressure from various sources to \\"choose\\" or to identify as a single racial identity. Others may feel pressure not to abandon one or more of their ethnicities, particularly if identified with culturally. Some children grow up without race being a significant issue in their lives because they identify against the one-drop-rule construct. This approach to addressing plural racial heritage is something U.S. society has slowly become socialized into as the general consensus among monoracially identified individuals is plural racial identity is a choice and presents disingenuous motives against the more oppressed inherited racial identity. By the 1990s, as more multiracial identified students attended colleges and university, many were met with alienation from culturally and racially homogenous groups on campus. This common national trend saw the launch of many multi-racial campus organizations across the country. By the 2000s, these efforts for self-identification soon reached beyond educational institutions and into mainstream society. In her book Love's Revolution: Interracial Marriage, Maria P. P. Root suggests that when interracial parents divorce, their mixed-race children become threatening in circumstances where the custodial parent has remarried into a union where an emphasis is placed on racial identity. Some multiracial individuals attempt to claim a new category. For instance, the athlete Tiger Woods has said that he is not only African-American but \\"Cablinasian,\\" as he is of Caucasian, African-American, Native American and Asian descent.

Native American identity In the 2010 Census, nearly 3 million people indicated that their race was Native American (including Alaska Native). Of these, more than 27% specifically indicated \\"Cherokee\\" as their ethnic origin. Many of the First Families of Virginia claim descent from Pocahontas or some other \\"Indian princess\\". This phenomenon has been dubbed the \\"Cherokee Syndrome\\". Across the US, numerous individuals cultivate an opportunistic ethnic identity as Native American, sometimes through Cherokee heritage groups or Indian Wedding Blessings. Levels of Native American ancestry (distinct from Native American identity) differ. The genomes of self-reported African Americans averaged to 0.8% Native American ancestry, those of European Americans averaged to 0.18%, and those of Latinos averaged to 18.0%. Many tribes, especially those in the Eastern United States, are primarily made up of individuals with an unambiguous Native American identity, despite being predominantly of European ancestry. Point in case, more than 75% of those enrolled in the Cherokee Nation have less than one-quarter Cherokee blood and the current Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, Bill John Baker, is 1/32 Cherokee, amounting to about 3%. Historically, non-Native governments have forced numerous Native Americans to assimilate into colonial and later American society, e.g. through adopting English and converting to Christianity. In many cases, this process occurred through forced assimilation of children sent off to special boarding schools far from their families. Those who could pass for white had the advantage of white privilege. Today, after generations of racial whitening through hypergamy, many Native Americans may have fair skin like White Americans, unlike mestizos in the United States, who may in fact have little or no non-indigenous ancestry. Native Americans are more likely than any other racial group to practice racial exogamy, resulting in an ever-declining proportion of indigenous blood among those who claim a Native American identity. Some tribes disenroll tribal members unable to provide proof of Native ancestry, usually through a Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood. Disenrollment has become a contentious issue in Native American reservation politics.

Interracial relations between Native Americans and African-Americans is a part of American history that has been neglected. The earliest record of African and Native American relations in the Americas occurred in April 1502, when the first Africans kidnapped were brought to Hispaniola to serve as slaves. Some escaped and somewhere inland on Santo Domingo, the first Black Indians were born. In addition, an example of African slaves' escaping from European colonists and being absorbed by Native Americans occurred as far back as 1526. In June of that year, Lucas Vasquez de Ayllon established a Spanish colony near the mouth of the Pee Dee River in what is now eastern South Carolina. The Spanish settlement was named San Miguel de Gualdape. Amongst the settlement were 100 enslaved Africans. In 1526, the first African slaves fled the colony and took refuge with local Native Americans.Muslims in American History : A Forgotten Legacy by Dr. Jerald F. Dirks. Page 204. European colonists created treaties with Native American tribes requesting the return of any runaway slaves. For example, in 1726, the British governor of New York exacted a promise from the Iroquois to return all runaway slaves who had joined them. This same promise was extracted from the Huron people in 1764, and from the Delaware people in 1765, though there is no record of slaves ever being returned.Katz WL 1997 p103 Numerous advertisements requested the return of African-Americans who had married Native Americans or who spoke a Native American language. The primary exposure that Native Americans and Africans had to each other came through the institution of slavery. Native Americans learned that Africans had what Native Americans considered 'Great Medicine' in their bodies because Africans were virtually immune to the Old-World diseases that were decimating most native populations. Because of this, many tribes encouraged marriage between the two groups, to create stronger, healthier children from the unions. For African- Americans, the one-drop rule was a significant factor in ethnic solidarity. African-Americans generally shared a common cause in society regardless of their multiracial admixture or social/economic stratification. Additionally, African-Americans found it, near, impossible to learn about their Native American heritage as many family elders withheld pertinent genealogical information. Tracing the genealogy of African-Americans can be a very difficult process, especially for descendants of Native Americans, because African-Americans who were slaves were forbidden to learn to read and write and a majority of Native Americans neither spoke English, nor read or wrote it. =Native American lineage and admixture in White and European- Americans= File:BenNCampbell.jpg Ben Campbell was born to an Azorian mother and father of Northern Cheyenne, Apache and Pueblo Indian descent.

Interracial relations among Native Americans and Europeans occurred from the earliest years of British, French and Spanish exploration. explorers and trappers. European impact was immediate, widespread and profound‚Äîmore than any other race that had contact with Native Americans during the early years of colonization and nationhood. Some early male settlers married Native American women or had informal unions with them. Early contact between Native Americans and Europeans was often charged with tension, but also had moments of friendship, cooperation and intimacy. Marriages took place in both English and Latin colonies between European men and Native women. For instance, on April 5, 1614, Pocahontas, a Powhatan woman in present-day Virginia, married the Englishman John Rolfe of Jamestown. Their son Thomas Rolfe was an ancestor to many descendants in First Families of Virginia. As a result, English laws did not exclude people with some Native American ancestry from being considered English or white. In the early 19th century, the Native American woman Sacagawea, who would help translate for and guide the Lewis and Clark Expedition in the West, married the French trapper Toussaint Charbonneau. Some Europeans living among Native Americans were called \\"White Indians\\". They \\"lived in native communities for years, learned native languages fluently, attended native councils, and often fought alongside their native companions.\\" European traders and trappers often married Native American women from tribes on the frontier and had families with them. Sometimes these marriages were done for political reasons between a Native American tribe and the European traders. Some traders, who kept bases in the cities, had what were called \\"country wives\\" among Native Americans, with legal European-American wives and children at home in the city. Not all abandoned their \\"natural\\" mixed-race children. Some arranged for sons to be sent to European-American schools for their education. Early European colonists were predominately men and Native American women were at risk for rape or sexual harassment especially if they were enslaved. Most marriages between Europeans and Native Americans were between European men and Native American women. The social identity of the children was strongly determined by the tribe's kinship system. This determined how easy it would be for the child assimilated into the tribe. Among the matrilineal tribes of the Southeast, such as the Creek and Cherokee, the mixed race children generally were accepted as and identified as Indian, as they gained their social status from their mother's clans and tribes and often grew up with their mothers and their male relatives. By contrast, among the patrilineal Omaha, for example, the child of a white man and Omaha woman was considered \\"white\\"; such mixed-race children and their mothers would be protected, but the children could formally belong to the tribe as members only if adopted by a man. In those years, a Native American man had to get consent of the European parents in order to marry a white woman. When such marriages were approved, it was with the stipulation that \\"he can prove to support her as a white woman in a good home\\". In the early twentieth century in the West, \\"intermarried whites\\" were listed in a separate category on the Dawes Rolls, when members of tribes were listed and identified for allocation of lands to individual heads of households in the break-up of tribal communal lands in Indian Territory. This increased intermarriage as some white men married Native Americans to gain control of land. In the late 19th century, three European-American middle- class female teachers married Native American men they had met at Hampton Institute during the years when it ran its Indian program. In the late nineteenth century, Charles Eastman, a physician of Sioux and European ancestry who trained at Boston University, married Elaine Goodale, a European- American woman from New England. They met and worked together in Dakota Territory when she was Superintendent of Indian Education and he was a doctor for the reservations. His maternal grandfather was Seth Eastman, an artist and Army officer from New England, who had married a Sioux woman and had a daughter with her while stationed at Fort Snelling in Minnesota. Black and African-American identity Americans with sub-Saharan African ancestry for historical reasons: slavery, partus sequitur ventrem, one-eighth law, the one- drop rule of 20th-century legislation, have frequently been classified as black (historically) or African-American, even if they have significant European-American or Native American ancestry. As slavery became a racial caste, those who were enslaved and others of any African ancestry were classified by what is termed \\"hypodescent\\" according to the lower status ethnic group. Many of majority European ancestry and appearance \\"married white\\" and assimilated into white society for its social and economic advantages, such as generations of families identified as Melungeons, now generally classified as white but demonstrated genetically to be of European and sub-Saharan African ancestry. Sometimes people of mixed Native American and African-American descent report having had elder family members withholding pertinent genealogical information. Tracing the genealogy of African-Americans can be a very difficult process, as censuses did not identify slaves by name before the American Civil War, meaning that most African Americans did not appear by name in those records. In addition, many white fathers who used slave women sexually, even those in long-term relationships like Thomas Jefferson's with Sally Hemings, did not acknowledge their mixed race slave children in records, so paternity was lost. Colonial records of French and Spanish slave ships and sales and plantation records in all the former colonies, often have much more information about slaves, from which researchers are reconstructing slave family histories. Genealogists have begun to find plantation records, court records, land deeds and other sources to trace African-American families and individuals before 1870. As slaves were generally forbidden to learn to read and write, black families passed along oral histories, which have had great persistence. Similarly, Native Americans did not generally learn to read and write English, although some did in the nineteenth century. Until 1930, census enumerators used the terms free people of color and mulatto to classify people of apparent mixed race. When those terms were dropped, as a result of the lobbying by the Southern Congressional bloc, the Census Bureau used only the binary classifications of black or white, as was typical in segregated southern states. In the 1980s, parents of mixed race children began to organize and lobby for the addition of a more inclusive term of racial designation that would reflect the heritage of their children. When the U.S. government proposed the addition of the category of \\"biracial\\" or \\"multiracial\\" in 1988, the response from the public was mostly negative. Some African-American organizations and African-American political leaders, such as Congresswoman Diane Watson and Congressman Augustus Hawkins, were particularly vocal in their rejection of the category, as they feared the loss of political and economic power if African-Americans reduced their numbers by self-identification. Since the 1990s and 2000s, the terms mixed race, multiracial and biracial have been used more frequently in society. It is still most common in the United States (unlike some other countries with a history of slavery) for people with visible African features to identify as or be classified solely as blacks or African-Americans, for cultural and familial reasons. President Barack Obama is of European-American and East African ancestry; he identifies as African-American.writing in Dreams from My Father that he had resolved to > \\"never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didn't speak to my own. > It was into my father's image, the black man, son of Africa, that I'd packed > all the attributes I sought in myself, the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, > DuBois and Mandela.\\" A 2007 poll, when Obama was a presidential candidate, found that Americans differed in their responses as to how they classified him: a majority of White and Hispanics classified him as biracial, but a majority of African-Americans classified him as black.61% of Hispanics and 55% of White Americans classify Obama as biracial when they are told that he has a white mother, while 66% of African-Americans consider him black. () Obama describes himself as \\"black\\" or \\"African American\\", using both terms interchangeably () A 2003 study found an average of 18.6% (¬±1.5%) European admixture in a population sample of 416 African-Americans from Washington, D.C. Studies of other populations in other areas have found differing percentages of ethnicity. Twenty percent of African-Americans have more than 25% European ancestry, reflecting the long history of unions between the groups. The \\"mostly African\\" group is substantially African, as 70% of African-Americans in this group have less than 15% European ancestry. The 20% of African Americans in the \\"mostly mixed\\" group (2.7% of US population) have between 25% and 50% European ancestry. The writer Sherrel W. Stewart's assertion that \\"most\\" African-Americans have significant Native American heritage, is not supported by genetic researchers who have done extensive population mapping studies. The TV series on African- American ancestry, hosted by the scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr., had genetics scholars who discussed in detail the variety of ancestries among African- Americans. They noted there is popular belief in a high rate of Native American admixture that is not supported by the data that has been collected. Genetic testing of direct male and female lines evaluates only two out of an individual's lines of ancestry. For this reason, individuals on the Gates show had fuller DNA testing. The critic Troy Duster, writing in The Chronicle of Higher Education, thought Gates' series African American Lives should have told people more about the limitations of genetic SNP testing. He says that not all ancestry may show up in the tests, especially for those who claim part-Native American descent. Other experts also agree. Population testing is still being done. Some Native American groups that have been sampled may not have shared the pattern of markers being searched for. Geneticists acknowledge that DNA testing cannot yet distinguish among members of differing cultural Native American nations. There is genetic evidence for three major migrations into North America, but not for more recent historic differentiation. In addition, not all Native Americans have been tested, so scientists do not know for sure that Native Americans have only the genetic markers they have identified. =Admixture= On census forms, the government depends on individuals' self-identification. Contemporary African-Americans possess varying degrees of admixture with European ancestry. A percentage also have various degrees of Native American ancestry. Many free African-American families descended from unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia. Their free descendants migrated to the frontier of Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina in the 18th and 19th centuries. There were also similar free families in Delaware and Maryland, as documented by Paul Heinegg.Paul Heinegg, Free African Americans of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware, 2005, accessed February 15, 2008. In addition, many Native American women turned to African-American men due to the decline in the number of Native American men due to disease and warfare. Some Native American women bought African slaves but, unknown to European sellers, the women freed the African men and married them into their respective tribes. If an African-American man had children by a Native American woman, their children were free because of the status of the mother. In their attempt to ensure white supremacy decades after emancipation, in the early 20th century, most southern states created laws based on the one-drop rule, defining as black persons with any known African ancestry. This was a stricter interpretation than what had prevailed in the 19th century; it ignored the many mixed families in the state and went against commonly accepted social rules of judging a person by appearance and association. Some courts called it \\"the traceable amount rule.\\" Anthropologists called it an example of a hypodescent rule, meaning that racially mixed persons were assigned the status of the socially subordinate group. Prior to the one-drop rule, different states had different laws regarding color. More importantly, social acceptance often played a bigger role in how a person was perceived and how identity was construed than any law. In frontier areas, there were fewer questions about origins. The community looked at how people performed, whether they served in the militia and voted, which were the responsibilities and signs of free citizens. When questions about racial identity arose because of inheritance issues, for instance, litigation outcomes often were based on how people were accepted by neighbors. The first year in which the U.S. Census dropped the mulatto category was 1920; that year enumerators were instructed to classify people in a binary way as white or black. This was a result of the Southern- dominated Congress convincing the Census Bureau to change its rules. After the Civil War, racial segregation forced African Americans to share more of a common lot in society than they might have given widely varying ancestry, educational and economic levels. The binary division altered the separate status of the traditionally free people of color in Louisiana, for instance, although they maintained a strong Louisiana Cr√©ole culture related to French culture and language, and practice of Catholicism. African Americans began to create common cause‚Äîregardless of their multiracial admixture or social and economic stratification. In 20th-century changes, during the rise of the Civil Rights and Black Power movements, the African-American community increased its own pressure for people of any portion of African descent to be claimed by the black community to add to its power. By the 1980s, parents of mixed race children (and adults of mixed race ancestry) began to organize and lobby for the ability to show more than one ethnic category on Census and other legal forms. They refused to be put into just one category. When the U.S. government proposed the addition of the category of \\"biracial\\" or \\"multiracial\\" in 1988, the response from the general public was mostly negative. Some African- American organizations and political leaders, such as Senator Diane Watson and Representative Augustus Hawkins, were particularly vocal in their rejection of the category. They feared a loss in political and economic power if African- Americans abandoned their one category. This reaction is characterized as \\"historical irony\\" by Reginald Daniel (2002). The African-American self- designation had been a response to the one-drop rule, but then people resisted the chance to claim their multiple heritages. At the bottom was a desire not to lose political power of the larger group. Whereas before people resisted being characterized as one group regardless of ranges of ancestry, now some of their own were trying to keep them in the same group. p. 128f.

Together with publicity about the ancestry of President Barack Obama, whose father was from Kenya, some black writers have argued that new terms are needed for recent immigrants. There is a consensus that suggests that the term African-American should refer strictly to the descendants of American Colonial Era chattel slave descendants which includes various, subsequent, Free People of Color ethnic groups who survived the Chattel Slavery Era in the United States. It's been recognized that grouping together all Afrodescent ethnicities, regardless of their unique ancestral circumstances, would deny the lingering effects of slavery within the American Colonial Era chattel slave descended community. A growing sentiment within the Descendants of American Colonial Era Chattel Slaves (DOS) population insists that ethnic African immigrants as well as all other Afro-descent and Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade descendants and those relegated, or self-designated, to the Black race social identity or classification recognize their own unique familial, genealogical, ancestral, social, political and cultural backgrounds. Stanley Crouch wrote in a New York Daily News piece \\"Obama's mother is of white U.S. stock. His father is a black Kenyan,\\" in a column entitled \\"What Obama Isn't: Black Like Me.\\" During the 2008 campaign, the mixed-race columnist David Ehrenstein (who is less than half African-American) of the LA Times accused white liberals of flocking to Obama because he was a \\"Magic Negro\\", a term that refers to a black person with no past who simply appears to assist the mainstream white (as cultural protagonists/drivers) agenda. Ehrenstein went on to say \\"He's there to assuage white 'guilt' they feel over the role of slavery and racial segregation in American history.\\" Reacting to media criticism of Michelle Obama during the 2008 presidential election, Charles Steele Jr., CEO of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference said, \\"Why are they attacking Michelle Obama and not really attacking, to that degree, her husband? Because he has no slave blood in him.\\" He later claimed his comment was intended to be \\"provocative\\" but declined to expand on the subject. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice (who was famously mistaken for a \\"recent American immigrant\\" by French President Nicolas Sarkozy), said \\"descendants of slaves did not get much of a head start, and I think you continue to see some of the effects of that.\\" She has also rejected an immigrant designation for African-Americans and instead prefers the terms black or white.

DNA analysis shows varied results regarding non-European ancestry in self- identified White Americans. A 2002 DNA analysis found that about 30% of self- identified White Americans have recent sub-Saharan African ancestry. A 2014 study performed on data obtained from 23andme customers found that the percentage of African or American Indian ancestry among White Americans varies significantly by region, with about 5% of White Americans living in Louisiana and South Carolina having 2% or more African ancestry.

The phenomenon known as \\"passing as white\\" is difficult to explain in other countries or to foreign students. Typical questions are: \\"Shouldn't Americans say that a person who is passing as white is white or nearly all white and has previously been passing as black?\\" or \\"To be consistent, shouldn't you say that someone who is one-eighth white is passing as black?\\" ... A person who is one-fourth or less American Indian or Korean or Filipino is not regarded as passing if he or she intermarries with and joins fully the life of the dominant community, so the minority ancestry need not be hidden... It is often suggested that the key reason for this is that the physical differences between these other groups and whites are less pronounced than the physical differences between African blacks and whites and therefore are less threatening to whites... [W]hen ancestry in one of these racial minority groups does not exceed one-fourth, a person is not defined solely as a member of that group. File:G. K.

File:Daniel Hale Williams.jpgDaniel Hale Williams was of African-American and Scots-Irish ancestry. Although members of his family passed as white, he exclusively served and identified with African- Americans. Laws dating from 17th-century colonial America defined children of African slave mothers as taking the status of their mothers and born into slavery regardless of the race or status of the father, under partus sequitur ventrem. The association of slavery with a \\"race\\" led to slavery as a racial caste. But, most families of free people of color formed in Virginia before the American Revolution were the descendants of unions between white women and African men, who frequently worked and lived together in the looser conditions of the early colonial period.Paul Heinegg, Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware, 1995‚Äì2005 While interracial marriage was later prohibited, white men frequently took sexual advantage of slave women, and numerous generations of multiracial children were born. By the late 1800s it had become common among African Americans to use passing to gain educational opportunities as did the first African- American graduate of Vassar College, Anita Florence Hemmings. Some 19th- century categorization schemes defined people by proportion of African ancestry: a person whose parents were black and white was classified as mulatto, with one black grandparent and three white as quadroon, and with one black great-grandparent and the remainder white as octoroon. The latter categories remained within an overall black or colored category, but before the Civil War, in Virginia and some other states, a person of one-eighth or less black ancestry was legally white.Winthrop Jordan, Black Over White, ch. IV, \\"The Fruits of Passion.\\" Some members of these categories passed temporarily or permanently as white. After whites regained power in the South following Reconstruction, they established racial segregation to reassert white supremacy, followed by laws defining people with any apparent or known African ancestry as black, under the principle of hypodescent. However, since several thousand blacks have been crossing the color line each year, millions of white Americans have relatively recent African ancestors (of the last 250 years). A statistical analysis done in 1958 estimated that 21 percent of the white population had some African ancestors. The study concluded that the majority of Americans of African descent were today classified as white and not black.AFRICAN ANCESTRY OF THE WHITE AMERICAN POPULATION, Ohio State University Hispanic and Latino American identity A typical Latino American family may have members with a wide range of racial phenotypes, meaning a Hispanic couple may have children who look white and African and/or Native American and/or Asian.\\"For Latinos \\"being white\\" is more of a state of mind than skin tone\\" , Politics in Color Latino Americans have several self- identifications; most Latinos identify as white in terms of race, while others identify as black and/or Native American and/or Asian.

Pacific Islander American identity During the 1800s Christian missionaries from Great Britain and the United States followed traders to the Hawaiian islands. Long-termly, the Anglo-Saxon presence negatively impacted the level of regard Hawaiian royal women held for their own indigenous looks. For centuries prior the arrival of Christians, first nation Hawaiian aesthetics, such as dark skin and ample bodies, had been considered signs of nobility. No matter how much they adapted their mannerisms to Western standard, some of the Anglo-Saxon missionaries were relentless in referring to the indigenous women as \\"Hawaiian squaws.\\" By the last half of the 19th century, some Hawaiian women began marrying European men who found them exotic. The men, however, selected Hawaiian women who were thinner and paler in complexion. While some American Pacific Islanders continue traditional cultural endogamy, many within this population now have mixed racial ancestry, sometimes combining European, Native American, as well as East Asian ancestry. The Hawaiians originally described the mixed race descendants as hapa. The term has evolved to encompass all people of mixed Asian and/or Pacific Islander ancestry. Subsequently, many ethnic Chinese also settled on the islands and married into the Pacific Islander populations. There are many other Pacific Islanders outside of Hawaii that do not share this common history with Hawaii and Asian populations are not the only race that Pacific Islanders mix with.

Eurasian-American identity In its original meaning, an Amerasian is a person born in Asia to an Asian mother and a U.S. military father. Colloquially, the term has sometimes been considered synonymous with Asian-American, to describe any person of mixed American and Asian parentage, regardless of the circumstances. According to the United States Census Bureau, concerning multiracial families in 1990, the number of children in interracial families grew from less than one-half million in 1970 to about two million in 1990. According to James P. Allen and Eugene Turner from California State University, Northridge, by some calculations the largest part white biracial population is white/American Indian and Alaskan Native, at 7,015,017; followed by white/black at 737,492; then white/Asian at 727,197; and finally white/Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander at 125,628. The US Census categorizes Eurasian responses in the \\"Some other race\\" section as part of the Asian race. The Eurasian responses which the US Census officially recognizes are Indo-European, Amerasian and Eurasian.

Afro-Asian-American identity Chinese men entered the United States as laborers, primarily on the West Coast and in western territories. Following the Reconstruction era, as blacks set up independent farms, white planters imported Chinese laborers to satisfy their need for labor. In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed and Chinese workers who chose to stay in the U.S. were unable to have their wives join them. In the South, some Chinese married into the black and mulatto communities, as generally, discrimination meant they did not take white spouses. They rapidly left working as laborers and set up groceries in small towns throughout the South. They worked to get their children educated and socially mobile. As of the census of 2000, there were 106,782 Afro-Asian individuals in the United States.

In fiction The figure of the \\"tragic octoroon\\" was a stock character of abolitionist literature: a mixed- race woman raised as if a white woman in her white father's household, until his bankruptcy or death has her reduced to a menial positionAriela J. Gross, What Blood Won't Tell: A History of Race on Trial in America, p 61 She may even be unaware of her status before being reduced to victimization.Kathy Davis. \\"Headnote to Lydia Maria Child's 'The Quadroons' and 'Slavery's Pleasant Homes',\\" Bucknell University, Summer 1997, accessed June 4, 2012 The first character of this type was the heroine of Lydia Maria Child's \\"The Quadroons\\" (1842), a short story. This character allowed abolitionists to draw attention to the sexual exploitation in slavery and, unlike portrayals of the suffering of the field hands, did not allow slaveholders to retort that the sufferings of Northern mill hands were no easier. The Northern mill owner would not sell his own children into slavery.Werner Sollors, Interracialism, p. 285 Abolitionists sometimes featured attractive, escaped mulatto slaves in their public lectures to arouse sentiments against slavery. They showed Northerners those slaves who looked like them rather than an \\"Other\\"; this technique, which is labeled White slave propaganda, collapsed the separation between peoples and made it impossible for the public to ignore the brutality of slavery.Lawrence R. Tenzer,\\"White Slaves\\", Multiracial.com Charles W. Chesnutt, an author of the post-Civil War era, explored stereotypes in his portrayal of multiracial characters in southern society in the postwar years. Even characters who had been free and possibly educated before the war had trouble making a place for themselves in the postwar years. His stories feature mixed-race characters with complex lives. William Faulkner also portrayed the lives of mixed-race people and complex interracial families in the postwar South. The 21st-century filmmaker Greg Pak suggests that multiracial characters in film have often been portrayed as more driven by instinct than whites.

The road is designated the A1270, and in Spring 2018 was named the Broadland Northway. It was given 'Programme Entry' status by the Department for Transport in December 2009. On 2 June 2015 the scheme was given the final go ahead, the road was completed on 17 April 2018, the western section having opened in late 2017. The project was initially for a road from the A47 to the west of Norwich at Easton passing to the north of the city and linking to the A47 to the east near Postwick. The project was later scaled back to start at the A1067 road. Norfolk County Council has announced that it is committed to providing the final section from the A1067 to the A47 at Easton to the west of Norwich, with the project being called the Norwich Western Link, and has made its delivery one of its three main Highways Objectives (2017) committing ¬£400,000 for further investigation of a potential route. Description The road has three distinct sections outlined below: =Postwick Hub= The ¬£21 million Postwick Hub scheme at the start of the NDR road is in the district of Broadland to the east of Norwich and includes development of the A47/A1042 junction and also a further 500 parking places at the Postwick Park and ride (one of six Norwich park and ride sites). =A47 (Postwick) to the A140= This is a dual carriageway road approximately 8.7 miles long. At its western end it starts at the A140 Cromer Road at a new grade separated junction, close to Norwich Airport. The route heads eastwards to pass to the south of communities of Horsham St Faith, Spixworth and Rackheath before joining the A47 Trunk Road at the existing Postwick Interchange. New at-grade roundabouts have been constructed where the NDR crosses the main radial roads linking the north and north east of Norfolk to Norwich city centre. =A140 to A1067 section= This section of dual carriageway east of the above section runs to the A1067. When the Department for Transport (DfT) decision on the shorter NDR was announced in December 2009, Adrian Gunson, cabinet member for planning and transportation, said that the council would seek planning permission for its preferred route from the A140 to the A1067 in the hope that funding could be secured at a later date. No other funding being found, Norfolk County Council elected to fund this section of the road itself from its own funds. =Norwich Western Link (NWL)= When the DfT decision on the shorter NDR was announced in December 2009 there were calls from councillors for the section between the A1067 at Attlebridge and the A47 at Easton to also be built, known as the Norwich Western Link. This project remains in the public eye because its delivery would be necessary to complete the Norwich Northern Bypass and give the industrial areas in the north of the city and Norwich Airport access to the A47 travelling west towards the west of the county and The Midlands. In early 2017 Norfolk County Council voted to make this project one of its three top highway priorities and ¬£400,000 was made available to explore how the NDR could join the A47 to the west of Norwich. Consultants Mouchel have been brought in to progress the scheme and discussions have taken place with Natural England and the Environment Agency. Eastern Daily Press 25 September 2017 History In 2005 Norfolk County Council persuaded the East of England regional assembly to add the road to the Regional Spatial Strategy as a late inclusion describing it as 'Norwich Northern Distributor road to improve access to the airport and development to the north of the city'. They also indicated that they would need to perform an environmental impact assessment, the realism of the cost estimates but had not decided on a route. In March 2006 Norfolk CC then deferred the decision to consult on the route due to environmental concerns by English Nature and the Environment Agency regarding the western end of the route where it would pass through the Wensum Valley. In August 2005 the council published their preferred route for the section from the A1067 to the A47 road in the east, but left open the possibility that the section from the A1067 to the A47 to the west of Norwich would not be included due to the objections relating to the Wensum Valley. In September 2005 the council dropped the section to the west of the A1067 from the proposal. In November 2005 the application by Norfolk County Council for funding from the Transport Innovation Fund was turned down. In December 2005 the road the East of England plan was examined in public with representations against the NDR from the Norwich & Norfolk Transport Action Group, Friends of the Earth and the Campaign to Protect Rural England. In June 2006 the report from the examination of the East of England Spatial Strategy recommended that the road should be dropped, citing the lack of consultation as the main reason and in March 2007 the Secretary of State accepted the decision and published her intended changes to the East of England Plan without the NDR. During 2007, The Department of Communities and Local Government (CLG) announced a competition to build up to 10 eco-towns.BBC article on Gordon Brown's eco-towns announcement September 2007: The government intervenes to block Norfolk Council's proposal to award any contract to build the road without going through a competitive tendering process. In August 2008 Norfolk county council propose Rackheath Eco-town as the site for one of the new 'eco-towns'. During the autumn of 2008 the council suggested that there would be a public inquiry in September 2009 with construction starting early in 2011 and completion by the end of 2012. While the East of England allocated RFA revenue to the road in February 2009, the Department for Transport warned in July 2009 that \\"given the fiscal uncertainty, increasing carbon constraints and DaSTS work in hand, a 10-year programme [of funding] must necessarily remain provisional at this stage.\\" Local Transport Today reported in April 2009 that the Department for Transport had \\"voiced concerns\\" about the scheme and suggested that the council might like to submit an alternative layout for an associated project, the Postwick Hub, which did not include the NDR. ¬£21 million had been allocated to the Postwick Hub through the Community Infrastructure Fund, conditional on the distributor road also receiving funding. John Dowie, director of regional and local transport delivery for the DfT, said that \\"It would be open to Norfolk to review the Postwick Junction design and prepare an alternative option that is less dependent on the NNDR\\". In June 2009, the site was given the go-ahead from the Government, after receiving an A-grade listing, meaning the location would be generally suitable for an eco- townhttp://www.building.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=3126903 Local campaigners said that relying on the NDR would make it unsustainable. In August 2009 the longer scheme to the A1067 was expected to cost ¬£117m. ¬£69m (60% of the estimated cost) was expected to come from the Regional Funding Allocation (RFA) and the remaining ¬£47.5m to be sought from Norwich Growth Point infrastructure funding, the Community Infrastructure Fund and developer contributions. In December 2009 the Department for Transport approved the project giving it 'Program Entry' status, but only for the section of road from the A140 by Norwich Airport and the A47 to the east of Norwich and suggested dates of early 2013 for a start to construction with completion in 2015. They also approved the Postwick Hub development. In May 2010 Local Transport Today revealed that, as part of the Government's drive to cut spending, all major transport schemes are being reviewed with an eye to reduce spending. This includes the Norwich Northern Distributor Road. In October 2010 Philip Hammond revealed that the scheme would be one of those competing for funding at the end of 2011 to be part of the second wave of transport projects given the go ahead by the coalition government.Local Transport Today, Issue 557, Page 7 In late October 2010 Graham Plant, cabinet member for transport and travel at Norfolk County Council, told the Eastern Daily Press that the NDR was being reviewed because of budget cuts. He also explained that it was likely to lead to cuts to the core bus network and park and ride. \\"What we need to know is what are residents‚Äô priorities,\\" he said. \\"We have looked at all the arguments for and against the NDR and the Postwick Hub. But I am well aware there are people who that doesn‚Äôt affect at all living in the rural hinterland, who need a bus service.\\" On 2 June 2015 the Norwich Northern Distributor Road was given the go ahead with work started in December 2015. On 20 July 2017 the Holt Road/Reepham Road link road near the A140 was opened, allowing the Holly Lane road to be closed and major work carried out on the junction between the Cromer Road and the NDR. On 11 November 2017, the first stretch between the A1067 Fakenham Road and A140 Cromer Road was opened. The central section from the A140 to the A1151 Wroxham Road opened on 21 December 2017. The final section linking the A1151 with the A47 at Postwick opened on 17 April 2018. Problems around the Rackheath section, mainly to do with a bridge over a railway line, delayed work on the eastern section. Scheme objectives The scheme objectives, as laid out in the Major Scheme Business Case, are to: * Reduce congestion on strategic routes to the north of the city * Reduce noise, air pollution and accidents for communities in the northern suburbs of Norwich and outlying villages * Enable the removal of through traffic from the city centre, and implementation of widespread pedestrianisation/bus priority measures * Provide direct access to growth locations, helping to deliver significant housing and employment growth as set out in the EEP RSS/RTS * Support the continued success of the Norwich economy as the driver to growth across the north of the region * Provide improved access to north and north east Norfolk The Greater Norwich Development Partnership, a non-departmental public body which includes Norfolk County Council and Norwich City Council, has described the dual carriageway as \\"an integral part of our plans to improve the local public transport network and reduce reliance on the private car.\\" The road was rated priority 'A1' by the East of England Regional Assembly and strongly supported by Norfolk County Council. Environmental impact The local Green Party candidate highlighted that the road would generate an addition 25,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions in the first year. Norfolk County Council have described the scheme as having 'large adverse' impacts on several protected species, including barn owls and bats and a 'moderate adverse' impact on landscape. Opposition The road was the focus of a long running UK road protest from a local campaign group and was also opposed by the Campaign for Better Transport, a public transport advocacy group. Campaign for Better Transport executive director Stephen Joseph criticised the scheme as poor use of funding when the DfT revealed the Norwich Northern Distributor Road was going ahead, while the Sustainable Travel Cities and Kickstart Bus programs were suspended. Despite the route having been changed so that it no longer crosses the River Wensum (a Site of Special Scientific Interest), some opponents argue that there would be pressure to extend the road across the valley in the future, see Norwich Western Link.

The whole island is high, but its highest point is only 150 m and there is not a single peak dominating the others. There is a lighthouse on the summit of the island. This island is at the southeastern end of the Bay of Bangkok, on the east side of the Gulf of Siam. Administratively Ko Phai belongs to the Amphoe Bang Lamung, Chonburi Province. The closest land to the Ko Phai group is Ko Lan, about 14 km to the east of Ko Phai's eastern shore. These islands can be reached in about two hours by boat from south Pattaya harbor. All these islands are a protected natural area under the supervision of the Royal Thai Navy. Visitors must bring their own food and water. No overnight stays are permitted on Ko Phai.

By Ken Finkel. February 10, 2016] Many of these criminal gangs were originally organized as volunteer Philadelphia Fire Department companies similar to the gang the Bowery Boys of the New York City Fire Department. Jimmy Haggerty ruled over the Schuylkill Rangers throughout the 1850s and was the gang's last leader until their break up following the American Civil War by an undercover Philadelphia Police lieutenant.Clark, Dennis. The Irish in Philadelphia: Ten Generations of Urban Experience. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1982. (pg. 115) He remained one of the city's most notorious bank robbers during the post-Civil War era and later resided in New York where he spent his last years before being murdered by Reddy the Blacksmith during a bar brawl in January 1871.Moss, Frank. The American Metropolis from Knickerbocker Days to the Present Time. London: The Authors' Syndicate, 1897. (pg. 25) Early life James Haggerty was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to a large working-class family near the banks of the Schuylkill River; his boyhood home was located on Arch Street in the area between Eighteenth and Nineteenth Street known as \\"McAran's Garden\\". His father, John Haggerty, was a \\"boss\\" drayman widely respected by the local business community \\"as an honest, upright and faithful servant\\". Haggerty remained free of criminal activity during his childhood, however he did not attend school and received little education. Jimmy Haggerty age 21 became employed a mule driver for the Reading Railroad. He continued in this profession, as well as ran a local saloon, until the start of the American Civil War in which he voluntarily enlisted in the Union Army.\\"The Haggerty Homicide.; Formal Investigation by Coroner Herrman Evidence by the Eye-Witnesses to the Affray No Verdict Rendered Reddy Admitted to Bail Departure of the Remains for Philadelphia\\". _New York Times._ 28 Jan 1871 Criminal career in Philadelphia Although it is unknown under the exact circumstances he left the service, whether he received an honorable discharge or took \\"French leave\\", he soon became a \\"bounty jumper\\". He became acquainted with a number of known criminals during this time and, returning to Philadelphia following the war, became involved in illegal bare-knuckle boxing and eventually petty theft, armed robbery and burglary. Although he was considered extremely violent when drunk, police officers testified to his reluctance to murder a victim in cold blood and described the frequent use of his pistol as a blackjack in confrontations, he was connected to a number of major robberies during his career. Among them were the robberies of the Eleventh Street and Chestnut Street Banks, the Philadelphia Savings Bank and the safe burglary of the Dancannon Iron Works. He was also involved in the robbery of White's Dental Depot where an African-American watchman was murdered. After numerous arrests for theft and similar offenses, he and Hugh Murphy were convicted of the robbery of a Ninth Street store and sentenced to ten years imprisonment on December 12, 1865. He was pardoned by Governor Andrew G. Curtin eight months later, in part to Haggerty's political connections and his promise to leave the country upon his release, and lived in Canada for a brief time before returning to the city to resume his criminal career. Haggerty remained a major underworld figure in Philadelphia until January 1869 when he was arrested on several counts of assault with intent to kill; during his arrest, he shot the arresting police officer. He was caught trying to escape from prison but was later released on bail and fled the city. Staying in New York for a brief time, he returned to Philadelphia in April to surrender himself to authorities after the wounded police officer had received \\"hush money\\". He won both court cases against him, but was ordered at the second trial to return to the Eastern State Penitentiary by the District Attorney for violating the terms of his release. While his lawyers argued the ruling, Haggerty escaped from the courthouse during a recess in what was suspected to have been planned. Criminal years in New York City and death He eventually returned to New York where he resided during the last two years of his life. He was involved in disputes with a number of criminal figures, for example, when he and Billy Tracy were thrown out of a Bowery gambling resort by its owner Harry Hill and British lightweight boxer Billy Edwards in November 1870.\\"Rampant Rowdyism.; Desperate Attempt to Murder Harry Hill in His Saloon--Arrest of One Man\\". _New York Times._ 11 Nov 1870 On the afternoon of January 24, 1871, Haggerty and three others arrived at Jem Mace's Capitol Saloon on Twenty-Third Street. They had become intoxicated while traveling by sleigh along Harlem Lane and, shortly after their arrival, they became involved in a violent altercation with another group of patrons. It was thought that Haggerty and his party were about to use their pistols when a local patrolman and a City Hall officer arrived from nearby Booth's Theater. At the appearance of the patrolman walking through the saloon door, Haggerty drew his revolver and pistol whiped him sending the officer outside. As the two officers went to get reinforcements, Haggerty and his men made their escape on the sleigh. His whereabouts remained unknown until early the next morning when he entered Patrick Egan's saloon. While there, his friend Billy Tracy became involved in a dispute with Shang Draper stemming from the earlier dispute at Jem Mace's saloon. Reddy the Blacksmith, a longtime member of the Bowery Boys, attempted to separate the two but Haggerty confronted Reddy and demanded that he stay out of it. As the two argued, Haggerty reportedly attempted to grab a decanter from the bar to strike the Bowery Boy with causing Reddy to draw his pistol and shot Haggerty in the abdomen. Haggerty was taken to a room in West Houston Street where claimed he did not know either Tracy or Draper and that he was so intoxicated that he was unable to recognize who fired the shot. Although mortally wounded, an examination finding the bullet had penetrated his intestines, Haggerty refused to name his attacker and died from his wounds later that evening.\\"\\"Reddy\\" Again.; Another Deed of Blood by One of Our Rulers.

Photograph of Jem Mace His funeral was perhaps one of the biggest held in Philadelphia's history and took place at his mother's residence at the northeast corner of Twenty-Third and Filbert Streets, the longtime headquarters of Schuylkill Rangers, and was attended by what was thought to be one of the largest criminal gatherings of the era.

Mundum Neriyathum Women dressed in Sari, scene from Kerala Mural, 1730 CE. It is worn as a garment that closely resembles the mundum neriyathum though it is not considered a true mundum neriyathum by classic definition. This is because the Kerala sari consists of a single piece of cloth while a traditional mundum neriyathum consists of a two-piece cloth. Otherwise, the Kerala sari closely resembles the mundum neriyathum and is often worn by Malayali women as a quasi mundum neriyathum. This one-piece sari in Kerala is derived from neighboring Tamil Nadu or Deccan during medieval period based on its appearance on various temple murals in medieval northern Kerala, modified by combining two-pieces of traditional Mundu in Kerala.Wall paintings in North Kerala, India: 1000 years of temple art, Albrecht Frenz, Ke.

The sari is a hot favorite during the time of Onam, not just in Kerala but in other parts of India as well. In popular culture Both the traditional and modern styles of the mundum neryathum are depicted in the paintings of the Indian painter Raja Ravi Varma. The mundum neriyathum was modified in several paintings depicting shakuntala from the mahabharatha to a style of draping now popularly known as the 'nivi saree' or 'national drape'.
