Professional career After a brief passport issue was resolved, Bangaly signed with Romanian Liga II club Râmnicu Vâlcea as a free agent in early 2012. He made his Liga II debut on April 25, 2012, playing the full 90 minutes of a 2–2 draw against Argeș Pitești. He made only one more appearance for Râmnicu Vâlcea before returning to his home country and joining ASEC Mimosas.

Bangaly left Ivory Coast once again in September 2015, when he was signed by South African Premier Division club Mamelodi Sundowns to compensate for the loss of Alje Schut, who returned to play in the Netherlands. He made his professional debut with the club on September 15, 2015, during a 2–1 loss to Golden Arrows. He was replaced at halftime by manager Pitso Mosimane after several mistakes, most notably failing to clear a ball which lead to the Golden Arrows' opening goal. It was also obvious he experienced communication issues, as he had hardly learned English. He only received nine minutes of playing time the rest of the calendar year, although reports showed he'd \\"been settling in and showing improvement in his performances and work rate\\" by December. By April 2016, he had fully integrated and was a regular member of the starting XI following several impressive performance in the CAF Champions League.

He was president of the Board of Health from 1868 to 1873 and was instrumental in the early development and management of the leper settlement of Kalaupapa. His surname is often misspelled as Hutchinson. Life Son of British Royal Navy Captain George Hutchison, he was born in Edinburgh and where he received his MRCS. He arrived in Hawaii around the early 1850. Prior to his rise to political prominence, he worked as a surgeon, magistrate, circuit judge and founded a sugar mill and became a prominent plantation owner. During the reign of King Kamehameha V, he was appointed as court physician. In 1865, he was appointed to succeed Charles Gordon Hopkins as Minister of the Interior, a position he held until 1873. He served briefly as Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1872 and 1873 and was a member of the House of Nobles, the upper house of the legislature, from 1866 to 1872. Writing in 1866, Mark Twain described Hutchison: > He has sandy hair, sandy mustache, sandy complexion—is altogether one of the > sandiest men I ever saw, so to speak: is a tall, stoop-shouldered, middle- > aged, lowering-browed, intense-eyed, irascible man, and looks like he might > have his little prejudices and partialities. He has got one good point, > however — he don't talk. Hutchison was also president of the Board of Health from 1868 to 1873 and was instrumental in the early development and management of the leper settlement of Kalaupapa on the island of Molokai. Previously as a board member, he had proposed the site as a place of exile after visiting the remote peninsula as a circuit judge. During his tenure as president, Hutchison adopted an economizing attitude to the conditions of the settlement and developed a bias toward the afflicted patients whom he regarded as amoral. One noted later exile was his own son Ambrose K. Hutchison, who was sent to the settlement on January 5, 1879 and became a superintendent of Kalaupapa from 1884 to 1897. His son never mentioned his father by name, possibly to shield him from the stigma of being related to a leper. In the early 1850s, while working as a port physician in Lahaina, Ferdinand William Hutchison married Maria or Malie Moa, a Native Hawaiian woman, who was the first of three wives. They had three children: Ambrose K. Hutchison, William Hutchison and Christina Hutchison, who were given to relatives to be raised after their mother's death. His son William had eleven children including a son he named Ambrose Ferdinand after the child's uncle and grandfather. In 1875, Hutchison moved to Australia taking his daughter Christina with him. He died at his residence, in Leichhardt, Sydney on May 20, 1893, at the age of seventy-four, after a long illness.

It flows through the Jaipur city, north to south over a length of 47.5 km, collecting storm and waste water from Naharika Nallah and Ambabari, the Ganda Nallah (draining ancient and new parts of Jaipur), and finally joins the Dhund river. Most of the Jaipur city's population stays within the 10 km periphery of Dravyavati river. Deterioration In 2016 the river was described as having deteriorated into a nullah, over the preceding century. The river had been comprehensively damaged by local pollution, garbage and debris.. Tata and sons were supposed to clear the debris and filth out of the River so as to change its status from Nullah to a river but nothing has happened yet. Moreover, the situation has worsened as of March 2020. One cause of the pollution is the collection of storm water from adjoining areas such as Ambabari, the Walled City of Jaipur, Sanganer town and Pratap Nagar. Sewerage mixed with domestic wastewater and industrial waste drains into the river through Nahri ka Nallah, Jawahar Nallah and other streams that come from structured and unstructured sewerage systems of the suburbs. Major flooding occurred in July 1981 that washed away many dams and embankments on the river. Subsequent encroaching development and pollution changed the nature of the river to the degree that it became known as \\"Amanishah nullah\\". Another flood in August 2012 left the city of Jaipur devastated, thousands homeless and many dead. Rejuvenation project In 2015 Tata Group produced a report for the rejuvenation of the river. This was approved by Rajasthan's state-level empowered committee (SLEC) in October 2015, having an estimated ten-year project cost, covering construction, operation and maintenance, of over 19 million Rupees. The contract for the project was awarded by the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) to a consortium comprising Tata Projects and the Shanghai Urban Construction Group with an initial cost of over 16 million Rupees to complete the work by October 2018. Construction works will include 85 check dams and 122 fall structures. As part of the rejuvenation project a combined footpath and cycle track running alongside the river from the source at Jaisalya to Goner, 47 km2, has been proposed.

The course has since attracted more than 985,000 non-native English speakers from around the world, making it one of the most popular edX courses globally.  Customised programs  The Institute works collaboratively with program sponsors (partners) and education representatives to design and deliver customised programs in any location and in a wide range of discipline areas, with or without English language training. Customised program partners include Ministries of Education in Indonesia, Vietnam, Macau, Chile, and Saudi Arabia, and world-leading universities and government agencies across Asia, Europe, and Latin America. History ICTE started in 1981 as a small, one-class English language training centre within the Institute of Modern Languages (Queensland) at The University of Queensland under a grant from the Australian Government's Australia-Japan Foundation. Several divisions at the university subsequently combined and were given the Institute's current name in 1996. ICTE has expanded over time to include: * The first IELTS test centre in Brisbane (1989) * Bridging English for students offered a place at UQ (2008) * UQ International Development division (2016), formerly a division of UniQuest, the university's main commercialisation company. The Institute has grown an international network of over 165 partner organisations and 100 education representatives which it harnesses, together with the expertise of The University of Queensland and experts in industry, to develop customised programs. Architecture and campus The Institute is housed in the purpose-built Sir Llew Edwards Building, a $42 million investment which involved three years of planning, design and construction and was completed in 2008. The building has won numerous architectural awards including the Australian Institute of Architects best public building in Queensland award for 2009. The Institute is located at the St Lucia campus of The University of Queensland, 7 kilometres from the Brisbane central business district. At its centre is the heritage-listed Great Court – a 2.5 hectares (6.2 acres) open area surrounded by Helidon sandstone buildings with grotesques of great academics and historic scenes, floral and faunal motifs and crests of universities and colleges from around the world. The campus fans out from a heritage-listed sandstone cloister to an extensive complex of buildings and landscaped grounds, including 3 lakes, 8 athletics ovals, 21 tennis courts, a large sports centre and an aquatics centre with an Olympic- sized swimming pool. The campus provides a self-contained environment for students and staff with numerous library and study spaces, health and child care services, art, museum and performance spaces, eating and retail venues. Notable staff Christine Bundesen AM, served as Director of ICTE for over 30 years, retiring in 2015. Ms Bundesen was a national advocate for quality standards in English language training and a pioneer of the Australian international education industry. She founded the first peak Australian body for the English language training sector, now known as English Australia, in the early 1980s and went on to play a lead role in Australian English language training standards and accreditation in the 1990s. She was instrumental in negotiating the first Australian Government Education Services for Overseas Students (ESOS) Act 2000 to protect the rights of international students in Australia. Ms Bundesen is the recipient of many awards including appointment as a Member of the Order of Australia in 2012 for service to the international education industry. Ms Bundesen is currently a member of the NEAS Australia board.

The station serves Yokneam Illit, Kiryat Tiv'on, Ramat Yishai and the surrounding area. The station is located between Yokneam and Kfar Yehoshua, east of Highway 70 and south of Highway 722. It is served by one to two trains per hour in each direction.  The new station  The Yokneam–Kfar Yehoshua railway station was built as part of the New Jezreel Valley railway, next to the Tishbi junction. The cost of constructing the station is estimated at 92 million NIS and was planned by architectural company Kuriel-Amar. The inspiration for the stations form came from the stations in the historical Jezreel Valley railway and also from the many agricultural structures that can be seen in the area with a similar design, a rectangular structure with a 2 sided roof. In addition to the station, there is also a water tower, inspired from the water towers that the historical line used. The original water towers were used for refilling the steam locomotives, but the modern tower was added to ensure constant water pressure in the station itself. The tracks are on ground level, but the access to the platforms requires the use of an underpass. The station is located approximately 3 k\\"m north-east of Yokneam, 2.5 k\\"m west of Kfar Yehoshua and 2 k\\"m east of Kiryat HaRoshet. The station is located outside of the urban areas and requires passengers to reach the station by vehicle, therefore the number of passengers has remained low. According to the numbers published by Israel Railways for 2017, 154,977 passengers used the station compared to 221,636 in the Beit She'an railway station and 346,536 in the Afula railway station.  Public transportation connections  Near the station there is a bus terminal. There are seven bus routes that stop at the terminal. The frequency of most of the routes is every one or two hours.

In Western society, there is an increasing trend towards bralessness among a number of women, especially millennials, who have expressed opposition to and are giving up wearing bras. New York City career coach Judith Gerberg says going braless in the workplace is increasingly common among younger women. \\"Millennial women are much more self-confident than women used to be.\\"Why women are going braless at work Being seen in public while not wearing a bra is becoming more acceptable, encouraging more women to go without. In 2016, Allure magazine fashion director Rachael Wang wrote, \\"Going braless is as old as feminism but it seems to be bubbling to the surface more recently as a direct response to Third Wave moments like #freethenipple hashtag campaign, increased trans-visibility like Caitlyn Jenner's Vanity Fair cover ... and Lena Dunham’s show Girls (which features young girls often without bras).\\" Going braless, which for many years was considered a political statement, has in recent years become fashionable. Women choose to go braless due to discomfort, health-related issues, their cost, and for social reasons, often having to do with self acceptance and political expression. Women have protested the physical and cultural restrictions imposed by bras over many years. A feminist protest at the 1968 Miss America Contest is often seen as the beginning of the anti-bra movement, prompting manufacturers to market new designs that created a softer, more natural look. Women are rejecting cultural expectations that their breasts should \\"stay firm and in the right position,\\" or that going braless means the woman is promiscuous. Bras are increasingly an issue for women and girls. Women and school-age girls in China, Malaysia, Canada, England, and the United States have been harassed and prosecuted for not wearing a bra. Women have sued employers for both attempting to require them to go braless, and for harassment and even termination as a result of choosing to be braless. Young women in high school have been disciplined for going braless. The young women often criticize administrators and faculty for failing to educate boys that girls should not be harassed or given undue attention because they are braless. They also complain that the requirement to wear a bra is unequal treatment, given that boys are not required to cover their breasts or nipples.  Lexicology  The word braless was first used circa 1965. Other terms for going braless include breast freedom, top freedom, and bra freedom.Zeisler, Andi. Feminism and Pop Culture: Seal Studies. Seal Press, 2008.Menon, Dilip. \\"An Ordinary Country.\\" The Journal of Asian Studies 69.3 (2010): 687-690. Activists advocating going braless have referred to protests as a \\"bra-cott\\".  World-wide trend  A Filipina woman braless In France, it has been common for women to go braless in public for a number of years. French journalist Sabina Socol has not worn a bra in years. In 2010, former model and France's first lady Carla Bruni welcomed Russian president Dmitry Medvedev at a state dinner in a tight dress that revealed she was braless. British gardening expert and TV personality Charlie Dimmock, who hosted her gardening show Ground Force from 1997 through 2005 on BBC, became well known for going braless at all times in all weather. Celebrity chef, television personality, and businesswoman Clarissa Dickson Wright only wore a bra on special occasions. Many celebrities world-wide have been seen braless in public for a number of years. A number of models and celebrities are commonly braless in public, including Kim Kardashian, Chrissy Teigen, Christina Milian, Kourtney Kardashian, Bella Thorne, Kendall Jenner, Demi Lovato, Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Lawrence, Claire Danes, and Rihanna. Rihanna once quipped, “If I'm wearing a top, I don't need to wear a bra.” Among young Chinese women in large cities like Shanghai and Beijing, some are adopting the braless trend, locally called \\"free the boobs.\\" South Korean singer and actress Sulli drew attention when she posted photos of herself braless on Instagram. In Kenya, Africa, celebrities like news anchor Janet Mbugua, television personality Vera Sidika, and Kenyan socialite Risper Faith are following the example of western celebrities and have gone braless in public. During March 2019 in Ghana, socialite and Instagram star Mona Montrage marked the country's Independence day by wearing traditional Kente cloth and posing braless.  Benefits of bralessness  Braless woman wearing a sheer cover over bikini bottoms Researchers and physicians have found health benefits for going braless. One researcher found that women who didn't wear a bra experienced less shoulder and neck pain. According to a study published in the Clinical Study of Pain, large-breasted women can reduce back pain by going braless, and they may find going braless a preferred treatment over reduction mammaplasty. Of the large-busted women participating in the study, 79% decided to stop wearing bras completely.  Improved breast shape  Obstetrician Lucky Sekhon stated that women with breasts of all size can benefit from bralessness. \\"Women with larger breasts may initially feel more uncomfortable than those with smaller breasts as their muscles may initially be weak and not feel strong enough to provide adequate support,\\" she says. \\"Over time, though, their bodies will adjust and naturally start to support the breast tissue appropriately, without the aid of a bra.\\" She states that there is evidence \\"that wearing a bra can make the muscles and ligaments that support the breasts lazy over time, leading to breast sagging and laxity.\\" She says the belief that going braless for an extended period of time makes your breasts sag is common misconception. \\"Women who have gone long periods without wearing a bra often report that this leads their breasts to being firmer, rounder, and perkier over time,\\" she says. Women with larger or fuller breasts may feel more back strain when not wearing a bra, though. \\"It can take weeks to months to build up the strength in their chest and back muscles for the breasts to become well supported without a bra,\\" she tells me. In another study, eleven adult female subjects aged 22–39 wore a correctly fitted bra for three months and then went braless for three months. After the bra-wearing period, when compared with the bra-free period, the distance between the woman's right and left nipples became wider, and their breasts sagged more. Professor Jean-Denis Rouillon, a sports science expert from the University of Franche-Comté at Besançon, France, conducted a 15-year long study that studied the benefits women get from wearing a bra. He discussed his preliminary research in 2013, generating considerable media attention in France and elsewhere. In a controversial finding, he concluded that the nipples of 330 women aged 18 to 35 who never wore bras were on average higher in relation to their shoulders each year than regular bra users. He concluded, Rouillon noted that all of the study volunteers were between 18 and 35 years old and that the study results were still preliminary. However, he said, \\"...a middle-aged woman, overweight, with 2.4 children? I'm not at all sure she'd benefit from abandoning bras.\\" His conclusions were supported in part by plastic surgeon Dr. Stafford Broumand from Mount Sinai Medical Center. \\"For younger women, not wearing a bra will lead to increased collagen production and elasticity, which improves lift in a developing breast. Also, tension on the connective tissue and ligaments supporting the breast can be beneficial to prevent sagging.\\" Rouillon's research has gained currency among some women who use it to bolster the argument that wearing bras is unhealthy and unnecessary. His study is cited by a number of articles that use it to support the idea that it's acceptable for a woman to go braless. But Rouillon's findings were ridiculed by some in the French media. His results and research methods were also questioned by some who challenged his findings because they were not published in a medical journal. Critics and skeptics noted that they cannot locate the actual study Rouillon is reported to have completed, but only reports about it, including the initial interview on French radio that sparked widespread coverage. As of 2006, about 10% of Australian women didn't wear a bra. Surveys have reported that 5–25 per cent of Western women do not wear a bra.  Better circulation  Because finding a well-fitting bra is difficult, women who wear bras sometimes feel constricted. One study found that 70% of women wear bras that are too small. Sekhon says that bras can impede blood flow to back and chest muscles, contributing to sore back muscles. Women with large breasts who stop wearing a bra may experience improved blood flow more quickly than women with smaller breasts, as bras supporting larger breasts tend to fit tighter than those worn by women with smaller breasts.  Increased comfort  Woman braless at the beach Sekhon says that women who are used to wearing a bra may initially feel self-conscious and exposed when they go braless. But as women go braless more often, they feel more comfortable and free. Women with large breasts feel increased comfort compared to women with smaller breasts. Some women who have gone braless while working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic don't want to go back to wearing bras again.  Better breast skin health  Women wearing a bra often experience \\"boob sweat\\", clogged pores, skin irritation, and body odor. Women can develop acne mechanica. Women can alleviate this problem by going braless.  Comfort = Braless at home  Upon returning home from a day at work, many women confess one of the things they look forward to is taking off their bra as soon as they get home. One editor wrote, \\"Taking your bra off is an extremely liberating feeling, and one we females look forward to—every day, all day long.\\" During the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent requirement for many people to work from home, many women publicly admitted to forgoing wearing a bra at all times. Miami fashion blogger Maria Tettamanti gladly confessed that while working from home she is braless. \\"The only positive attribute coming out of this pandemic is the notion we can work from home braless — free of wires, overly snug, overly padded bras.\\"'It’s a happiness I’ve never known': Should you live the braless life in quarantine? During April 2020, online bra sales dropped 12%, while among bras that were selling, wireless bra sales rose 40 percent.Wireless bra sales up 40 percent as women work from home amid coronavirus Women welcomed the chance to avoid the normal discomfort that often accompanies wearing a bra. One clothing manufacturer surveyed 1000 women and found that 35% of women were braless while working from home. They also reported that hashtags like #nobranoproblem and #bralessandflawless were common on Twitter.  Comfort over fashion  A Harris Poll commissioned by Playtex in 2009 asked more than 1,000 women what they like in a bra. Among the respondents, 67 per cent said they prefer wearing a bra to going braless, while 85 per cent wanted to wear a \\"shape-enhancing bra that feels like nothing at all.\\" They were split as regards underwire bras: 49 per cent said they prefer underwire bras, the same percentage as those who said they prefer wireless bras. Apparel company Ruby Ribbon surveyed 3,000 women in 2014 in advance of National No Bra Day about their attitudes towards their breasts and bras. Among respondents, 92 percent said they simply want support and comfort and are less interested in sex appeal or fashionable colors and designs. Twenty-one percent rated their bra \\"An Enemy—I wish I had never met her\\", and nearly half (46%) answered, \\"A Business Partner—I put up with her\\". When asked to describe their bra in one word, the most popular term was \\"uncomfortable.\\"  Bra fit and discomfort  A variety of factors make it difficult for women to find a bra that fits properly. These include widely varying international manufacturing standards and measurement methods, the variety of bra sizes, and the wide anatomical differences among women. In some women, one breast is slightly larger than the other. More obvious and persistent asymmetry in breast size occurs in up to 25% of women. Women tend to find a bra that appears to fit and stay with that size for a long period of time even though they may lose and gain weight. Medical studies have shown that most women experience pain as a result of wearing a bra, and shown that it is difficult for women to find a correctly fitting bra. As a result of these factors, 80 – 85% of women who wear a bra are wearing the wrong bra size. In one study, 70% of women wear bras that are too small and 10% wear bras that are too large. Women complain of breast, shoulder, neck, and back pain, migraines, indigestion, skin abrasions, and restricted breathing due to wearing bras. Women who have large breasts are more likely to experience discomfort. Large cup size has been correlated with an increase in shoulder and neck pain. One researcher found that 40% of women who rode horses reported breast pain. Women often cite the discomfort and pain associated with wearing bras as the primary reason for disliking them and for giving up wearing one.  Health issues  Western women have been taught to believe that bras are sometimes required for medical or physiological reasons. New York OBGYN Niels Lauersen wrote, Susan M. Love, a Clinical Professor of Surgery at UCLA, is a founder of the National Breast Cancer Coalition. She wrote, \\"Except for the women who find bras especially comfortable or uncomfortable, the decision to wear or not wear one is purely aesthetic - or emotional. If you don't enjoy it, and job or social pressures don't force you into it, don't bother.\\"Love, Susan, MD. Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book 2015 Da Capo Lifelong Press  Effect on health  A 2000 study published in the U.S. National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health described how the pressure created by wearing a bra can disrupt sleep cycle and circadian rhythm, even if a woman doesn't wear a bra to bed. Heidi Lehmann, a master bra designer, says, \\"It is essential for the breasts to rest adequately to stay healthy.\\"  Cancer fears  A woman braless in Central Park, New York City Many women choose not to wear a bra based on one study and a controversial book that linked wearing bras and an increased risk for cancer. The 1991 study found that premenopausal women who do not wear bras had half the risk of breast cancer compared with bra users. This study and the controversial 1995 book Dressed to Kill: The Link Between Breast Cancer and Bras has been cited by many women as the source of their concern about the link between bras and cancer. A 2002 survey found that 31 percent of women agreed that \\"Under-wire bras can cause breast cancer\\" and another six percent were not sure. Scientists at the American Cancer Society responded that there is little credible scientific evidence supporting any correlation between wearing bras and cancer. The New York Times reported, \\"There is no scientifically credible evidence... and the proposed mechanism-- that bras prevent elimination of toxins by blocking lymph flow--is not in line with scientific concepts of how breast cancer develops. Internet traffic on the issue is mostly inspired by one study with several scientific flaws, Dr. Gansler said. The study, never published in a peer-reviewed journal, did not adjust for known breast cancer risk factors that might be associated with bra- wearing behavior, like weight and age. Also, study participants knew the hypothesis before taking the survey.\\" The United States National Cancer Institute states that bras have not been found to increase a woman's risk for breast cancer,Fact Sheet on Breast Cancer Risk Factors , from the U.S. National Cancer Institute. Accessed July 10, 2008. and the American Cancer Society stated, \\"There are no scientifically valid studies that show wearing bras of any type causes breast cancer.\\" A well-regarded 2014 study by researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle found no direct link between wearing a bra and developing breast cancer. The report noted, \\"no aspect of bra wearing, including bra cup size, recency, average number of hours a day worn, wearing a bra with an underwire, or age first began regularly wearing a bra, was associated with risks\\" of breast cancer. The study included detailed studies of women's lifestyle and bra-wearing habits and found no correlation between bra use and cancer. The study did not include women who did not wear a bra as a comparison with those who did. Despite the contradictory scientific evidence, women cite the fear of breast cancer as a reason to discontinue wearing bras. Breast temperature increases while wearing a bra.The Lancet, November 4, 1978, p. 1001 Dr. John M. Douglass, Department of Internal Medicine, S. Calif. Permanente Med. Center, Los Angeles, California  Breast sagging  Some women incorrectly believe that breastfeeding contributes to breast sagging. Researchers have found breastfeeding and weight gain during pregnancy does not influence sagging. Instead, they identified the key factors as age, significant weight gain or loss, high BMI, whether a woman smoked cigarettes, and the number of pregnancies a woman has had. Hereditary factors influencing sagging include skin elasticity, breast size before pregnancy, and breast density (the ratio of fat to glandular tissue). Another common misconception is that bras are required to keep breasts from sagging later in life. Dr. Mary Jane Minkin, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale University School of Medicine, stated that there is no relationship between wearing a bra and whether breasts sag. Researchers, bra manufacturers, and health professionals cannot find any evidence to support the idea that wearing a bra for any amount of time arrest, slows, or in any way affects breast ptosis. John Dixey, former CEO of bra-maker Playtex, explained on a British TV Channel 4 interview, \\"We have evidence that wearing a bra could not prevent sagging, because the breast itself is not muscle, so keeping it toned up is an impossibility.... There's no permanent effect on the breast from wearing a particular bra. The bra will give you the shape the bra's been designed to give while you're wearing it.\\"  Social issues  Modern women have been socialized to believe that perky breasts are desirable. Laura Tempesta, bra expert and founder of bra manufacturer Bravolution, stated, “Lifted breasts are considered attractive in our culture which is why bra-wearing is a cultural development.” Women feel pressured to wear bras because society expects their breasts to \\"stay firm and in the right position,\\" or that if they are braless, it means she is promiscuous, loose, or slutty. An increasing number of millennial women reject these ideas as holdovers from earlier eras when a \\"woman's existence is for the male gaze.\\" Going braless, which for many years was considered a political statement, has in recent years become fashionable. An increasing number of women, especially those among the millennial generation, feel more comfortable about not wearing a bra, and what they wear is based more on what they want and not due to social norms or feminist ideology. With the increasing acceptance of the Me Too movement, co-workers and others may think that don't have the right to say anything about a women who fails to wear a bra. Jennifer Maher, a gender studies professor at Indiana University, says wearing or not wearing a bra is no longer \\"a feminist tenet.\\"  Feminist reaction  During the 1960s, a few feminists embraced bralessness. However, most Western women continued to wear bras, despite complaining about how uncomfortable they were. In 1968 at the feminist Miss America protest, protesters symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \\"Freedom Trash Can\\". These included bras, which were among items the protesters called \\"instruments of female torture\\" and accouterments of what they perceived to be enforced femininity. A local news story in the Atlantic City Press reported that \\"the bras, girdles, falsies, curlers, and copies of popular women's magazines burned in the 'Freedom Trash Can'\\". But individuals who were present said that no one burned a bra nor did anyone take off her bra. Reporter Lindsy Van Gelder drew an analogy between the feminist protesters and Vietnam War protesters who burned their draft cards, and this parallel between protesters burning their draft cards and women burning their bras was encouraged by some organizers including Robin Morgan. \\"The media picked up on the bra part\\", Carol Hanisch said later. \\"I often say that if they had called us 'girdle burners,' every woman in America would have run to join us.\\" Feminism and \\"bra-burning\\" became linked in popular culture. While feminist women may or may not literally have burned their bras that day, some stopped wearing them in protest. Feminist author Bonnie J. Dow suggested that the association between feminism and bra-burning was encouraged by individuals who opposed the feminist movement. \\"Bra-burning\\" created an image that women weren't really seeking freedom from sexism, but were attempting to assert themselves as sexual beings. This might lead individuals to believe, as Susan J. Douglas wrote, that the women were merely trying to be \\"trendy, and to attract men.\\" Some feminist activists believe that anti-feminists use the bra burning myth and the subject of going braless to trivialize what the protesters were trying to accomplish at the feminist 1968 Miss America protest and the feminist movement in general. The trope of feminists burning their bras was anticipated by an earlier generation of feminists who called for burning corsets as a step toward liberation. In 1873 Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward wrote: Some feminists began arguing in the 1960s and 1970s that the bra was an example of how women's clothing shaped and even deformed women's bodies to male expectations. Professor Lisa Jardine listened to feminist Germaine Greer talk about bras during a formal college dinner in Newnham College, Cambridge, in 1964 (Greer had become a member of the college faculty in 1962): Greer's book The Female Eunuch (1970) became associated with the anti-bra movement because she pointed out how restrictive and uncomfortable a bra could be. \\"Bras are a ludicrous invention\\", she wrote, \\"but if you make bralessness a rule, you're just subjecting yourself to yet another repression.\\" Cited in . Susan Brownmiller in her book Femininity (1984) took the position that women without bras shock and anger men because men \\"implicitly think that they own breasts and that only they should remove bras.\\" Feminist author Iris Marion Young wrote in 2005 that the bra \\"serves as a barrier to touch\\" and that a braless woman is \\"deobjectified\\", eliminating the \\"hard, pointy look that phallic culture posits as the norm.\\" Without a bra, in her view, women's breasts are not consistently shaped objects but change as the woman moves, reflecting the natural body. Young also argued that training bras are used to indoctrinate girls into thinking about their breasts as sexual objects and to accentuate their sexuality. She wrote in 2007 that, in American culture, breasts are subject to patriarchal American media- dominated culture [that] objectifies breasts before such a distancing glance that freezes and masters.\\" Academic Wendy Burns-Ardolino wrote in 2007 that women's decision to wear bras is mediated by the \\"male gaze\\". Some women choose to go braless as part of a \\"new wave of feminism\\" and an opportunity to challenge social expectations of how they should act and look. In March, 2017, actress Emma Watson was braless in a Vanity Fair photo shoot. She was criticized by some who thought she was a hypocrite for supporting feminism and showing some skin. She responded, \\"Feminism is about giving women a choice; feminism is not a stick with which to beat other women with. It's about freedom, it's about liberation, it's about equality. I really don't know what my tits have to do with it.\\"  Impact on sales In 1970, bra and girdle sales were about $900 million, down from $1 billion the prior year. But the reduction in sales was due to sharply lower girdle sales, which have been negatively affected by the increasing popularity of panty hose and shorter skirts.Barmash, Isadore Bra Industry Reacts to Women's Lib New York Times Sept. 13, 1970 Manufacturers designed and marketed products that appealed to consumers' personal pride. Themes included \\"Be Some Body with Formfit Rogers\\" and \\"Exquisite Form Loves Women in Full Flower.\\" Bra sales increased sharply. But bra makers also noted the beginning of a trend in which women would rather not wear bras, especially when relaxing at home or in other informal surroundings.  Bralessness as a form of protest  In the 1960s, some hippie women went braless to make political statements about sexual liberation or their relationship with nature and their bodies. In 1966, during the height of the hippie era in San Francisco, two women students at San Francisco State College protested a proposed law that would require women to wear bras by walking topless near the campus. On August 1, 1969, an Anti-Bra Day was declared in San Francisco to protest societal pressure to wear constrictive, feminine garments. The protest drew large crowds, blocking traffic, and a few women took their bras off from under their clothing in the Financial District.  Bralessness as a fashion  Braless woman wearing a Bebe T-shirt In 1968, shortly after the feminist protest against bras and other feminine products at the Miss America pageant, actress Marlo Thomas began going braless on the prime-time television series That Girl. \\"God created women to bounce, so be it.\\" Thomas said in an interview in Good Housekeeping magazine. \\"If I bounce, I'm glad to be a girl.\\" On August 5, 1970, the New York Times wrote that \\"the braless look has established a beachhead in Manhattan....Generally speaking, the braless woman is under 30 and small‐breasted. But grandmothers are also among the throngs, as are C and D cuppers—who get the most comment, both pro and con, from male oglers.\\" In 1971, activist and actress Bianca Jagger broke tradition and wore a tailored Yves St. Laurent Le Smoking jacket to her Catholic wedding with nothing underneath. Singer, songwriter, model, and actress Debbie Harry was well known for going braless during the 1970s. Model and actress Jerry Hall set an example during the same period when she was frequently photographed braless and featured in fashion magazines. Writer and social influencer Sabina Socol, known to have a full figure, is also known for never wearing a bra. She attributes it to discomfort. The young female characters on Lena Dunham’s controversial HBO show Girls (2012-2017) were often without bras.\\" An increasing number of women question previously accepted medical, physiological, anatomical, and social reasons for wearing bras. They recognize that they wear bras for psychological, aesthetic, or practical reasons. An informal movement advocates breast freedom, top freedom, bra freedom, or simply going braless. There are a large number of magazine articles and YouTube videos in which women describe their motives and offer guidance on how to go braless. Poet Savannah Brown of London published a YouTube video, \\"sav's guide to going braless\\", which has nearly one million views.  Religious issues  In 2009 Somalia's hard-line Islamic group Al- Shabaab forced women to shake their breasts at gunpoint to see if they were wearing bras, which they called \\"un-Islamic\\". A resident of Mogadishu whose daughters were whipped said, \\"The Islamists say a woman's chest should be firm naturally, or flat.\\"  Free the Nipple campaign  A campaign participant at the World Naked Bike Ride in London, June 2015 Women took part in the Free the Nipple campaign after a movie of that name was made in 2015. They protested the legal prohibitions and cultural taboos attached to exposing female breasts in places where it is legal for men to be topless.Esco, Lina. Free the Nipple. Disruptive Films Inc., 2014 The Free the Nipple campaign was sparked in part due to double standards and the censorship of women's bodies on social media. Its' advocates believe that women's nipples should be legally and culturally acceptable.The History of the No Bra Movement In many Western countries, women used social media to show their support of the right to go topless or without a bra. In Iceland during Free the Nipple day in 2015, some female university students purposefully wore clothing that revealed they were not wearing a bra and a few others chose to go topless for the day. Teen Vogue reported that the Free the Nipple movement may have initially focused on being actually topless, but it has grown to include the idea of going braless under clothes. Women are seeking to free the nipple beneath the outer clothing they wear.  No Bra Day  One outgrowth of the resistance to bras was the formation of No Bra Day in 2013. In 2017, the unofficial day was observed by women in 30 countries, including New Zealand, Romania, Malaysia, Scotland, India, and Ghana. More than 82,000 women posted pictures on Twitter and Instagram using the hastag #nobraday.  Empowerment of women  Some media outlets have capitalized on the no bra phenomenon with exploitative stories. The tabloid website TMZ posted an item about \\"Happy No Bra Day\\" with an image of Selena Gomez wearing a see-through top. Another site featured a photo gallery titled \\"#NoBraDay: 15 Celebs Who Frolick About With Their Fun Bags Freed\\". Whether a woman wears a bra or not has progressed in some social circles from discussions about appropriate clothing to \\"the body shaming and sexualizing of women\\" and a \\"societal debate on the equality of men and women, as it pertains to their bodies.\\" One woman commented, \\"The reason is that I tried being braless, and I liked it better. It wasn't a political decision, except insofar as everything a woman does with her body that isn't letting someone else dictate what she ought to do with it is a political decision.\\" French journalist Sabina Socol commented, \\"I never liked wearing bras; I always felt suffocated in them.\\" She grew up in a household where going braless wasn't seen as sexual or taboo. \\"Even as a woman with breasts, I do what I want with my body. Every human has nipples. There shouldn’t be any shame [in showing them], but if you want to hide them, that’s okay, too, as long as the choice is yours.\\" In June, 2017, Sarah Starks organized a protest in Charleston, West Virginia in response to the social expectation that women and girls must wear bras and shirts to avoid offending or arousing others. \\"It's sexual because people say it is,\\" she added. A West Virginia University professor of social work commented that \\"if other people are made uncomfortable by it, that's cultural and that's social...\\" Starks commented that breasts are \\"like this separate, sexual part of us, and if you want to be taken seriously as a woman, cover them up.\\" The protest's purpose was to show that nipples and breasts are not sexual objects. Some of the marchers went braless, others topless, and others fully clothed.  Opposition to training bras  In Western culture, the bra is sometimes viewed as an icon of popular culture, and purchasing a girl's first bra is seen by some as a long-awaited rite of passage into womanhood, signifying her coming of age. The age at which girls first wear bras is sometimes controversial. Within Western cultures that place great value upon youth, bras are marketed to women of all ages by emphasizing their ability to preserve a youthful appearance. Young girls may begin to develop breasts as early as age 9 or as late as 18. The early stage of breast development is known as \\"breast budding\\" and is measured on the Tanner scale. Some believe that girls who are developing breasts may be self- conscious and desire a bra to conceal their emerging breasts and for psychological comfort. A girl developing breasts has no physical need for support, so training bras serve only social and psychological purposes. Bras of all kinds are often designed and marketed for fashionable rather than functional purposes. The training bra is marketed to help young girls become accustomed to wearing lingerie. Critics of training bras say companies are appealing to very young girls' desire to feel more sexy and attractive. The opponents believe that manufacturers market training bras as a way to sexualize young girls and indoctrinate them into thinking about their breasts as sexual objects. The critics believe that businesses benefit financially by encouraging precocious sexuality in girls and exploiting their fears about self-image and social norms.  Legal issues  The number and variety of legal issues faced by women about whether to wear a bra or not illustrates the depth and complexity of the subject in society.  Security issues  In Chatham, Ontario, Canada, police came under criticism after it was revealed that they required a woman to remove her bra while in a holding cell. A judge rebuked the police department after a woman held in custody was required to remove her bra before a breathalyzer test. The police stated that they required women in custody to give up their any item which could be used as a ligature – including necklaces, ties, shoelaces and bras – to protect them against using their bras as \\"ligatures for self-harm or strangulation.\\" According to her lawyer, the woman doesn't normally go braless in public and was \\"terrified and upset\\" by being required to remove her bra. In 2013, a judge required York Regional Police to change the same policy. Vancouver police also required women at that time to remove their bra. Police subsequently amended their policy from a blanket requirement to a case-by-case assessment. In a similar case in Osaka during 2017, a female defendant was forbidden from wearing a bra while in custody. Police rules allow women to request a bra for a court appearance, but her request was denied. Her attorneys filed a complaint with the Osaka Bar Association, claiming that denying the woman's right to wear a bra was a \\"breach of human rights\\". The right of prisoners to choose bralessness was affirmed in the province of Ontario, Canada in 2014.  Workplace dress codes  While some employers continue to require women to wear bras, an increasing number of younger women believe it is acceptable to go braless in the workplace. Depending on relevant laws, employers may not be able to require different dress standards for men and women. In New York state, human rights law prevents employers from \\"applying grooming or appearance standards that impose different requirements for people based on gender.\\" Shea Allen, a local US TV reporter in Huntsville, Alabama, wrote about her reporting duties on her personal blog. She said, among other things, that \\"I've gone braless during a live broadcast and no one was the wiser\\". When she was \\"terminated without cause\\" three days later, media reports speculated that it was due to her comment about not wearing a bra on the job. One commentator responded that \\"These sorts of corporate rules are just a way of forcing women to walk an extremely thin line between being conventionally feminine (wear skirts and dresses, not pants!) but without doing anything that could be construed as sexual (but don't even allow a hint of nipple to be visible!)\\" During a report on the increasing trend for women at work to go braless, host Val Warner on WLS TV in Chicago removed her bra from under her white top in front of a studio audience while broadcasting Windy City Live.Chicago Anchor Takes Off Her Bra Live On Air In January 2011, a German court ruled that employers can require female employees to wear bras or undershirts at work. An airport security firm argued that requiring bras was essential \\"to preserve the orderly appearance of employer-provided uniforms.\\" The court also agreed that the company could require employees to keep their hair clean and male employees to be clean shaven or maintain a well-trimmed beard. In Germany employers and companies are permitted to require their female employees to wear a brassiere as part of the dress code, and may dismiss female employees who do not wear them. In August 2011, Wendy Anderson of Utah sued her employer for sexual harassment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In her suit, she claimed that Derek Wright, her employer, attempted to require her to adhere to a dress code that included a \\"No Bra Thursday\\". She alleged that he regularly discussed Anderson's breast size with her in front of other employees. Anderson and her former employer reached a mediated settlement in August 2013. Richard Branson, the owner of Virgin Rail in Britain, caused an uproar among his female train attendants when he introduced new uniforms in May 2013. A number of them complained that the new blouses they are required to wear are too revealing and expose their bras to the public. Virgin Rail offered a voucher worth £20 to allow the unhappy employees to purchase a top to wear underneath the new blouses. Genevieve Loiselle protested when the female manager at the restaurant she is employed by in Timmons, Ontario, Canada demanded that she wear a bra to work. Loiselle said the manager pointed out that she could see Loiselle's nipple piercings. Loiselle obtained the restaurant's dress code found it did not mention bras, and that the requirement to wear a bra is discriminatory. The manager later denied that she had required Loiselle to wear a bra. After publication of the story, the restaurant chain relented and told Loiselle that she was not required to wear a bra. Case law in Canada is beginning to establish that employers can't require gender-specific clothing unless there's a \\"non-discriminatory, justifiable reason for doing so,\\" according to labor and employment lawyer Morgan Rowe. In Selkirk, Manitoba, Canada, 19-year-old Kate Gosek complained when several managers at the McDonald's where she was a cook harassed her about not wearing a bra to work. Gosek thinks bras are uncomfortable. The McDonald's dress code did not require women to wear a bra, but the manager told her, \\"it is an expectation.\\" Gosek received an apology from two managers in October 2018. Christina Schell was hired as a server at the Greenside Grill located at Osoyoos Golf Club in Osoyoos, British Columbia in May 2018. After three weeks, her manager asked all employees to sign a new dress code agreement which stated, \\"Women must wear either a tank top or bra under their uniform shirt.\\" When Schell questioned the requirement, her manager told her the dress code was for her protection. Schell had stopped wearing bras at age 23 because they were uncomfortable. Schell refused her manager's demand and was fired. She filed a complaint with the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal against the golf club. Schell said the dress code is \\"gender-based and that's why it's a human rights issue,\\" she said. \\"I have nipples and so do the men.\\"  Academic dress codes  School dress codes are increasingly contested by students who resist rules that are enforced based on a person's weight or gender. Bras are a focal point among students who think the codes have become too invasive. In 2006, administrators at a school in Singapore discovered during the physical education class that some girls were wearing colored bras, contrary to the dress code, which required light gray, beige, or white bras. The girls were ordered to return to the bathroom and remove their bra, which was then confiscated. The braless girls were embarrassed to be seen afterward, especially by the male staff. After getting badly sunburned, 17-year-old high school student Lizzy Martinez wore a boy's loose, oversized, long-sleeve, crew-neck T-shirt without a bra to school in April, 2017. She was called out of class to the dean's office where she was told she was causing a \\"distraction\\". They stated that boys were \\"looking and laughing\\" at her and that she was violating the School District of Manatee County's dress code, although the district's dress code does not require females to wear a bra. She told them she was sunburned, and they required her to wear an additional shirt. The dean told her that her nipples were still showing through her T-shirt, and told her to obtain adhesive bandages from the school's clinic to cover her nipples. The American Civil Liberties Union wrote a letter to the school district protesting what they described as their discriminatory enforcement of the school's dress code. Martinez continued to refuse to wear a bra to school, stating, \\"I was wearing a shirt given to me by a male friend and I'm 100 percent sure he wasn't wearing a bra the countless times he wore it to school.\\" Martinez said, \\"If the boys in my class were so distracted, shouldn't they have been talked to and educated about the situation and not me being pulled out of class?\\" She organized a \\"bracott\\" two weeks later during which she encouraged female students to attend school without a bra, or to wear a shirt with a supportive message. During the protest, about 30 female students didn't wear bras, and several students marked their backpacks with adhesive bandages in the shape of an X. University of Richmond law professor Meredith Harbach, who has written about sexualization and public school dress codes, said that the school was \\"foisting this notion that unrestrained breasts are sexual and likely to cause disruption and distract other students.\\" In Montana, senior Kaitlyn Juvik at Helena high school was reprimanded on May 25, 2016 for wearing an off-the- shoulder black top without a bra. She had stopped wearing a bra a year earlier. She was told she was causing male students and staff to feel \\"uncomfortable.\\" The school handbook doesn't require bras, but forbids students from showing a bra strap. The principal insisted the issue wasn't about whether she wore a bra, but her dress that made others uncomfortable and prompted him to ask her to \\"cover up.\\" A friend of hers created a Facebook page named No Bra, No Problem about the issue, which quickly attracted over 1,200 members. About 300 fellow students joined her in protesting her treatment by attending school on May 27 without a bra. Several male students wore bras outside their shirts to support the protest. The school's reaction and her protest drew international attention. Juvik stated that the issue of women wearing or not wearing a bra is larger than about whether a woman wears an article of clothing. She told People that it's about \\"the body shaming and sexualizing of women.\\" \\"Wearing a bra is a personal choice. It's my body. Why is it anybody else's business whether I'm wearing a bra, especially when I'm covered up and dressed appropriately?\\" She created an Instagram page \\"Warrior without a bra\\" that attracted tens of thousands of subscribers within just a couple of weeks. A high school student attending Beaumont High School in Southern California wore a black bodysuit and baggy jeans to school when an assistant vice principal told her she had to put on a jacket. The vice principal told her \\"that because I wasn't wearing a bra, she didn't want people to think anything bad of me or talk inappropriately or have anything bad to say.\\" The high school dress code does not require girls to wear a bra. In a similar incident during 2018 in Texas, a high school girl commented, \\"It is not a requirement in the dress code at my school for me to wear a bra. Stop blaming girls’ outfits for boys not being raised right to respect women.\\" In Montreal during 2018, a girl attending Le Pensionnat du Saint-Nom-de-Marie, a private girls school, was asked to cover up because she wasn't wearing a bra under her T-shirt. In response, students started a petition requesting the freedom not to wear a bra at school. The school stated that their dress code doesn't formally require wearing a bra. The school head said that the issue of wearing a bra is \\"a societal debate on the equality of men and women, as it pertains to their bodies.\\" High school girls in Quebec began wearing yellow squares on their clothing during March,2018, to protest a \\"restrictive and sexist” school dress code. Female students demanded the right to go without bras. Célestine Uhde, one of four students who organized the protest, wrote that bras can be uncomfortable. The students \\"launched the movement to fight the culture of rape and hypersexualization. We want the equality of men and women both in our treatment and how the world views our bodies.\\" She said, \\"We as women shouldn't be put down because of our bodies.\\"  In popular culture  Prior to strict enforcement of the Hays Code in mid-1934, actress Carole Lombard was always braless, as was Jean Harlow. Many pre-code movies were characterized by sexual energy, including scenes of women obviously braless. After the code was enforced, bralessness was not shown in film again until the 1960s.Smith, Bonnie G. The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History, Volume 1 Notable instances of women braless in popular culture include: * Clara Bow plays Nasa “Dynamite” Springer in the 1932 pre-code film Call Her Savage. Wearing a flimsy white blouse, she is obviously braless in multiple scenes. * In April 1957, Italian actress Sophia Loren was being welcomed to Hollywood by Paramount Pictures at a dinner party at Romanoff's restaurant in Beverly Hills. Busty American actress Jayne Mansfield was seated between Loren and Clifton Webb. Braless and wearing a deeply plunging neckline, she at one point purposefully stood up and leaned forward, exposing her 40D bust and her left nipple. Photographer Delmar Watson captured Loren staring at Mansfield's breasts, and Joe Shere caught Loren looking side-eye at Mansfield's bust. Both pictures went viral, receiving world-wide attention. * The success of the television show Charlie's Angels was sometimes attributed to the scanty or provocative clothing frequently worn by the female stars. Actress Farrah Fawcett once said the TV show's success was due to what critics described as \\"Jiggle TV\\". She said, \\"When the show was number three, I figured it was our acting. When it got to be number one, I decided it could only be because none of us wears a bra.\\" * Director George Lucas required actress Carrie Fisher to forego wearing a bra during filming of Star Wars. He told her, \\"There's no underwear in space.\\" He later explained to her that human bodies expand in space, and that her bra might have strangled her. She replied sarcastically, \\"Really? Now I understand it.\\"  See also  * History of bras  References  Category:19th-century fashion Category:20th-century fashion Category:21st- century fashion Category:Brassieres Category:Breast Category:Feminism and health Category:History of clothing (Western fashion) Category:Lingerie Category:Undergarments Category:1960s fads and trends ","title":"Bralessness"},{"id":"52146945","text":"Epepeotes strandi is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

It was written in 1965 after the assassination of Malcolm X, soon after the poet (formerly LeRoi Jones) had taken on a new name.The poem issued a clarion call for art by and for Black people: > We want a black poem. And a Black World. Let the world be a Black Poem And > Let All Black People Speak This Poem Silently or LOUD The poem sparked the beginning of the Black Arts Movement in poetry. \\"Black Art\\" was published in The Liberator in January 1966, and subsequently re- published in numerous anthologies.  Interpretations  The poem is described as one of Baraka’s most expressive political poems, as it uses sharp language, onomatopoeia and violence to call out the nation. The poem itself is about poems and how black artists must stand for being black and not copy or imitate white poets. Baraka is calling for black artists to have meaning in their art and produce content that defends their blackness. Baraka felt that his work should fully divulge the nationwide racism and create “poems that kill”. Baraka uses terms such as “negroleader”, “jewlady’s”, and “whities” to clearly explain that his message is targeting the race hardships faced for people of color living in the south in the 1960s. It uses strong imagery to focus on the violence and allow the readers to slip into the mind of Baraka and experience the poem as their own life. “Let there be no love poems written until love can exist freely and cleanly.” Baraka calls for realism in black poetry, to stop cookie cutting away and over-glorifying the lives that black people must live in a racist nation. He wants the black people to understand that they must achieve a black aesthetic and a black worldview in order to be free from the race constraints placed on them by white society. A poem such as \\"Black Art\\" (1965), according to Werner Sollors, of Harvard University, expressed the authors need to commit the violence required to \\"establish a Black World\\".Sollors, Werner (1978). Amiri Baraka / LeRoi Jones: The Quest for a \\"Populist Modernism\\". Columbia University Press. Baraka even uses onomatopoeia in \\"Black Art\\" to express that need for violence: \\"rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr . . . tuhtuhtuhtuhtuhtuht . . .\\" More specifically, lines in \\"Black Art\\" such as \\"Let there be no love poems written / until love can exist freely and cleanly\\" juxtaposed with \\"We want a black poem. / And a Black World\\" demonstrate Baraka's cry for political justice during a time when racial injustice was rampant, despite the Civil Rights Movement.Nelson (2000). Anthology of Modern American Poetry. pp. 998–999. Amiri Baraka's \\"Black Art\\" serves as one of his most controversial, yet poetically profound supplements to the Black Arts Movement. In this piece, Baraka merges politics with art, criticizing poems that are not useful to or adequately representative of the Black struggle. First published in 1966, a period particularly known for the Civil Rights Movement, the political aspect of this piece underscores the need for a concrete and artistic approach to the realistic nature involving racism and injustice. Serving as the recognized artistic component to and having roots in the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Arts Movement aims to grant a political voice to black artists (including poets, dramatists, writers, musicians, etc.). Playing a vital role in this movement, Baraka calls out what he considers to be unproductive and assimilatory actions shown by political leaders during the Civil Rights Movement. He describes prominent Black leaders as being \\"on the steps of the white house...kneeling between the sheriff's thighs negotiating coolly for his people.\\" Baraka also presents issues of euro-centric mentality, by referring to Elizabeth Taylor as a prototypical model in a society that influences perceptions of beauty, emphasizing its influence on individuals of white and black ancestry. Baraka aims his message toward the Black community, with the purpose of coalescing African Americans into a unified movement, devoid of white influences. \\"Black Art\\" serves as a medium for expression meant to strengthen that solidarity and creativity, in terms of the Black Aesthetic. Baraka believes poems should \\"shoot…come at you, love what you are\\" and not succumb to mainstream desires. He ties this approach into the emergence of hip-hop, which he paints as a movement that presents \\"live words…and live flesh and coursing blood.\\" Baraka's cathartic structure and aggressive tone are comparable to the beginnings of hip-hop music, which created controversy in the realm of mainstream acceptance, because of its \\"authentic, un- distilled, unmediated forms of contemporary black urban music.\\" Baraka believes that integration inherently takes away from the legitimacy of having a Black identity and Aesthetic in an anti-Black world. Through pure and unapologetic blackness, and with the absence of white influences, Baraka believes a black world can be achieved. Though hip-hop has been serving as a recognized salient musical form of the Black Aesthetic, a history of unproductive integration is seen across the spectrum of music, beginning with the emergence of a newly formed narrative in mainstream appeal in the 1950s. Much of Baraka's cynical disillusionment with unproductive integration can be drawn from the 50s, a period of rock and roll, in which \\"record labels actively sought to have white artists \\"cover\\" songs that were popular on the rhythm-and-blues charts\\" originally performed by African American artists. The problematic nature of unproductive integration is also exemplified by Run-DMC, an American Hip-Hop group founded in 1981, who became widely accepted after a calculated collaboration with the rock group Aerosmith on a remake of the latter's \\"Walk This Way\\" took place in 1986, evidently appealing to young white audiences. Hip-Hop emerged as an evolving genre of music that continuously challenged mainstream acceptance, most notably with the development of rap in the 1990s. A significant and modern example of this is Ice Cube, a well-known American rapper, songwriter, and actor, who introduced subgenre of hip-hop known as \\"gangsta rap,\\" merged social consciousness and political expression with music. With the 1960s serving as a more blatantly racist period of time, Baraka notes the revolutionary nature of hip-hop, grounded in the unmodified expression through art. This method of expression in music parallels significantly with Baraka's ideals presented in \\"Black Art,\\" focusing on poetry that is also productively and politically driven.

Those similarities have attracted Indian and Western scholars attention, and have also been criticised by concurring schools. The similarities have been interpreted as Buddhist influences on Advaita Vedanta, though some deny such influences, or see them as expressions of the same eternal truth.N.V. Isaeva (1993), Shankara and Indian Philosophy, SUNY Press, pages 12-14 Advaita Vedanta (IAST, '; ; literally, not-two) is the oldest extant sub-school of Vedanta – an orthodox (āstika) school of Hindu philosophy and religious practice. Advaita (philosophies, world views, teachings) is one of the classic Indian paths to spiritual realization. It took shape with the writings of Gaudapada in the 6th century CE. Buddhism is a religion and dharma that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices based on teachings attributed to the Buddha (5th century BCE), but diversified since then in a wide variety of practices and traditions. Buddhism originated in India, from where it spread through much of Asia. It declined in India during the middle ages, after the rise of new forms of Hinduism, including Advaita Vedanta. Similarities with Buddhism Advaita Vedanta and various other schools of Hindu philosophy share numerous terminology and doctrines with Buddhism. Of the various schools, the similarities between Advaita and Buddhism have attracted Indian and Western scholars attention. Isaeva states in her analysis of scholarly views, that these have historically and in modern times ranged from \\"Advaita and Buddhism are very different\\", to \\"Advaita and Buddhism absolutely coincide in their main tenets\\", to \\"after purifying Buddhism and Advaita of accidental or historically conditioned accretions, both systems can be safely regarded as an expression of one and the same eternal absolute truth\\". Scholarly comments Scholars such as Belvalkar, Hiriyanna, Radhakrishnan and Thibaut state that Advaita's and Buddhism's theories on True Reality and Maya are similar,Helmuth Von Glasenapp (1995), Vedanta & Buddhism: A comparative study, Buddhist Publication Society, pages 2-3, Quote: \\"Vedanta and Buddhism have lived side by side for such a long time that obviously they must have influenced each other. The strong predilection of the Indian mind for a doctrine of universal unity has led the representatives of Mahayana to conceive Samsara and Nirvana as two aspects of the same and single true reality; for Nagarjuna the empirical world is a mere appearance, as all dharmas, manifest in it, are perishable and conditioned by other dharmas, without having any independent existence of their own. Only the indefinable \\"Voidness\\" (Sunyata) to be grasped in meditation, and realized in Nirvana, has true reality [in Buddhism]\\". and the influence of Buddhism on Advaita Vedanta has been significant. Both traditions hold that \\"the empirical world is transitory, a show of appearances\\", and both admit \\"degrees of truth or existence\\". Both traditions emphasize the human need for spiritual liberation (moksha, nirvana, kaivalya), however with different assumptions. Frank Whaling states that the similarities between Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism are not limited to the terminology and some doctrines, it includes practice. The monastic practices and monk tradition in Advaita are similar to those found in Buddhism. Furthermore, according to Natalia Isaeva, \\"Probably because of these similarities, even such an astute Buddhologist as Rozenberg was of the opinion that a precise differentiation between Brahmanism and Buddhism is impossible to draw\\". Concurring schools The similarities with Buddhism have been criticised by concurring Indian schools. Ramanujacharya, the founder of Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, accused Adi Shankara of being a Prachanna Bauddha, that is, a \\"crypto-Buddhist\\", and someone who was undermining theistic Bhakti devotionalism. The non-Advaita scholar Bhaskara of the Bhedabheda tradition, similarly around 800 CE, accused Shankara's Advaita as \\"this despicable broken down Mayavada that has been chanted by the Mahayana Buddhists\\", and a school that is undermining the ritual duties set in Vedic orthodoxy. Mahadevan states, \\"At the outset it must be pointed out that, when the critics hurl the charge of pseudo-Buddhism against Advaita, they use the word Buddhism rather in a vague and general sense. The doctrine of unreality of the world, and the theory of non- recognition are found to be common as between the idealistic schools of Buddhism and Advaita. Most critics believe that these are not Upanishadic doctrines, and so, their conclusion is that Advaita must have borrowed them from the Mahayana schools. And the earliest teacher who effected this borrowing, in their view, is Gaudapada.\\" Influence of Mahayana Buddhism Scholars state that Advaita Vedanta was influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, given the common terminology, methodology and some doctrines. points out that the early commentators on the Brahma Sutras were all realists, or pantheist realists. He states that they were influenced by Buddhism, particularly during the 5th-6th centuries CE when Buddhist thought developing in the Yogacara school. Eliot Deutsch and Rohit Dalvi state: Gaudapada Scholars are divided on possible Buddhist influence on Gaudapada's writing. The influence of Mahayana on Advaita Vedanta, states Deutsch, goes back at least to Gaudapada, where he \\"clearly draws from Buddhist philosophical sources for many of his arguments and distinctions and even for the forms and imagery in which these arguments are cast\\". Gaudapada, in his Karikas text, uses the leading concepts and wording of Mahayana Buddhist school but, states John Plott, he reformulated them to the Upanishadic themes. The influence of Buddhism on Gaudapada, states , is undeniable and to be expected. He writes, Michael Comans states Gaudapada, an early Vedantin, utilised some arguments and reasoning from Madhyamaka Buddhist texts by quoting them almost verbatim. However, Comans adds there is a fundamental difference between Buddhist thought and that of Gaudapada, in that Buddhism has as its philosophical basis the doctrine of Dependent Origination according to which \\"everything is without an essential nature (nissvabhava), and everything is empty of essential nature (svabhava-sunya)\\", while Gaudapada does not rely on this principle at all. Gaudapada's Ajativada is an outcome of reasoning applied to an unchanging nondual reality according to which \\"there exists a Reality (sat) that is unborn (aja)\\" that has essential nature (svabhava) and this is the \\"eternal, fearless, undecaying Self (Atman) and Brahman\\". Thus, Gaudapada differs from Buddhist scholars such as Nagarjuna, states Comans, by accepting the premises and relying on the fundamental teaching of the Upanishads. Mahadevan suggests that Gaudapada adopted Buddhist terminology and borrowed its doctrines to his Vedantic goals, much like early Buddhism adopted Upanishadic terminology and borrowed its doctrines to Buddhist goals; both used pre-existing concepts and ideas to convey new meanings. Some scholars suggests that Gaudapada (6th Century CE) bridged Buddhism and Vedanta, by taking over the Buddhist doctrines that ultimate reality is pure consciousness (vijñapti-mātra) and \\"that the nature of the world is the four-cornered negation\\". According to Gaudapada, the Absolute Reality, that is Brahman, is not subject to birth, change and death. The Absolute is aja, the unborn eternal.John Plott (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Patristic-Sutra period (325 - 800 AD), Volume 3, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 285-288 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan also opines that Gaudapada's philosophy is different from that of Adi Shankara and Badarayan. , and suggest that Gaudapada took over the Buddhist concept of ajāta from Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka philosophy, which uses the term anutpāda. An equivalent theory of Ajātivāda, \\"the Doctrine of no-origination\\" or \\"non-creation\\", is the fundamental philosophical doctrine of Gaudapada. Other scholars, however, refute this idea. According to , Gaudapada's doctrines are unlike Buddhism. Gaudapada's influential text consists of four chapters; Chapter One, Two and Three of which are entirely Vedantin and founded on the Upanishads, with little Buddhist flavor. Chapter Four uses Buddhist terminology and incorporates Buddhist doctrines but Vedanta scholars who followed Gaudapada through the 17th century, state both Murti and Richard King, never referenced nor used Chapter Four, they only quote from the first three. While there is shared terminology, the doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are fundamentally different, states .Gaudapada , Devanathan Jagannathan, University of Toronto, IEP refutes the argument for Buddhist influence on Gaudapada's philosophy by arguing that the whole purpose of Gaudapada was to demonstrate the ultimate reality of the birth-less and non- dual Atman, a concept foreign to Buddhism. Scholars such as Murti state that, while there is shared terminology, the doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are fundamentally different. Shankara Given the principal role attributed to Shankara in Advaita tradition, his works have been examined by scholars for similarities with Buddhism. Buddhism supporters have targeted Shankara, states , while his Hindu supporters state that \\"accusations\\" concerning explicit or implicit Buddhist influence are not relevant. Daniel Ingalls writes, \\"If we are to adopt a metaphysical and static view of philosophy there is little difference between Shankara and Vijnanavada Buddhism, so little, in fact that the whole discussion is fairly pointless. But if we try to think our way back into minds of philosophers whose works we read, there is a very real difference between the antagonists\\". Ninian Smart, a historian of religion, quotes Mudgal view that \\"the differences between Shankara and Mahayana doctrines are largely a matter of emphasis and background, rather than essence\\".Ninian Smart (1992), Doctrine and Argument in Indian Philosophy. Brill, page 104 Mudgal additionally states that the Upanishadic and Buddhist currents of thought \\"developed separately and independently, opposed to one another, as the orthodox and heterodox, the thesis and antithesis, and a synthesis was attempted by the Advaitin Shankara\\".S Mudgal (1975), Advaita of Shankara: A Reappraisal, Motilal Banarasidass, page 175 Dasgupta and Mohanta suggest that Buddhism and Shankara's Advaita Vedanta represent \\"different phases of development of the same non-dualistic metaphysics from the Upanishadic period to the time of Sankara.\\" Differences from Buddhism=Atman and anatta Advaita Vedanta holds the premise, \\"Soul exists, and Soul (or self, Atman) is a self evident truth\\". Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, \\"Atman does not exist, and An-atman (or Anatta, non-self)Anatta, Encyclopædia Britannica (2013), Quote: \\"Anatta in Buddhism, the doctrine that there is in humans no permanent, underlying soul. The concept of anatta, or anatman, is a departure from the Hindu belief in atman (\\"the self\\").\\" is self evident\\".Dae-Sook Suh (1994), Korean Studies: New Pacific Currents, University of Hawaii Press, , page 171 Buddhists do not believe that at the core of all human beings and living creatures, there is any \\"eternal, essential and absolute something called a soul, self or atman\\".[a] KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, , pages 246-249, from note 385 onwards; [b] Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, , page 64; \\"Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of ātman is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [Buddhist] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence.\\"; [c] Edward Roer (Translator), to Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad, pages 2-4; [d] Katie Javanaud (2013), Is The Buddhist ‘No- Self’ Doctrine Compatible With Pursuing Nirvana?, Philosophy Now Buddhists reject the concept and all doctrines associated with atman, call atman as illusion (maya), asserting instead the theory of \\"no-self\\" and \\"no-soul\\".Helen J Baroni (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism, Rosen Publishing, , page 14 Buddhism, from its earliest days, has denied the existence of the \\"self, soul\\" in its core philosophical and ontological texts. In contrast to Advaita which describes knowing one's own soul as identical with Brahman as the path to nirvana, in its soteriological themes, Buddhism has defined nirvana as that blissful state when a person realizes that he or she has \\"no self, no soul\\". Epistemology The epistemological foundations of Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta are different. Buddhism accepts two valid means to reliable and correct knowledge – perception and inference, while Advaita Vedanta accepts six.; ; ; However, some Buddhists in history, have argued that Buddhist scriptures are a reliable source of spiritual knowledge, corresponding to Advaita's Śabda pramana, however Buddhists have treated their scriptures as a form of inference method. Ontology Advaita Vedanta is a substance ontology, an ontology \\"which holds that underlying the seeming change, variety, and multiplicity of existence there are unchanging and permanent entities (the so-called substances)\\". In contrast, Buddhism is normally understood as a process ontology, according to which \\"there exists nothing permanent and unchanging, within or without man\\". describes that there is also a current in Buddhism which favours substance ontology and sees Madhyamaka and Yogacara as reactions against developments toward substance ontology in Buddhism. Advaita's three levels of reality theory, states , is built on the two levels of reality found in the Madhyamika.

It is a rare orchid with an erect, hairy leaf and up to three pale yellow flowers. Only about fifty specimens are known and it is threatened by habitat destruction and by too-frequent or too infrequent bushfires.Caladenia busselliana habit Description Caladenia busselliana is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and wide. There are up to three pale yellow flowers on a stem high. The flowers are long and wide. The lateral sepals and petals spread widely and the sepals are thickened. The labellum is pale yellow to white and lacks the red tip common to similar spider orchids. The sides of the labellum have narrow teeth or calli which have a \\"clubbed\\" end. There are four or more rows of red-tipped calli along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs between September and October and is followed by a non- fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing a large number of seeds. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia busselliana was first formally described by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown in 2001 from a specimen collected by Greg Bussell near Quindalup and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (busselliana) honours the collector of the type specimen. Distribution and habitat Bussell's spider orchid grows in swampy jarrah forest and marri woodland, often with green kangaroo paw, (Anigozanthos viridis) and the more common swamp spider orchid (Caladenia paludosa). It is only known from two small areas near Vasse and Yallingup at the northern end of the Leeuwin- Naturaliste ridge in the Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic region. Conservation Caladenia busselliana is classified as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and as \\"rare flora\\" under the Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act 1950.

They are sometimes called witches' marks, a term also used to denote identifying marks once thought to be found on the bodies of witches. Marks on buildings Apotropaic marks (from Greek apotrepein \\"to ward off\\" from apo- \\"away\\" and trepein \\"to turn\\") are symbols or patterns scratched into the fabric of a building with the intention of keeping witches out through apotropaic magic. Evil was thought to be held at bay through a wide variety of apotropaic objects such as amulets and talismans against the evil eye. Marks on buildings were one application of this type of belief. Marks have been found at Shakespeare's Birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon, at the Tower of London, and many churches, but little effort has been made to find them on secular buildings. The marks are most common near places where witches were thought to be able to enter, whether doors, windows or chimneys. For example, during works at Knole, near Sevenoaks in Kent, in 1609, oak beams beneath floors, particularly near fireplaces, were scorched and carved with scratched witch marks to prevent witches and demons from coming down the chimney. At the Bradford-on-Avon Tithe Barn, a flower-like pattern of overlapping circles is incised into a stone in the wall. Similar marks of overlapping circles have been found on a window sill dated about 1616 at Owlpen Manor in Gloucestershire, as well as taper burn marks on the jambs of a medieval door frame. The most recent and astounding collection of over 100 marks - previously thought to be graffiti - was discovered February 2019 in Creswell Crags, Notts, by Hayley Clark and Ed Waters of Subterranea Britannica during a tour of the caves. Other types of mark include the intertwined letters V and M or a double V (for the protector, the Virgin Mary, alias Virgo Virginum), and crisscrossing lines to confuse any spirits that might try to follow them.

It is named after Greek mathematician Athanassios S. Fokas. Traditionally, linear boundary value problems are analysed using either integral transforms and infinite series, or by employing appropriate fundamental solutions. Integral transforms and infinite series For example, the Dirichlet problem of the heat equation on the half-line, i.e., the problem u_0 and g_0 given, can be solved via the sine-transform. The analogous problem on a finite interval can be solved via an infinite series. However, the solutions obtained via integral transforms and infinite series have several disadvantages: 1\\\\. The relevant representations are not uniformly convergent at the boundaries. For example, using the sine-transform, equations and imply For g_0(t) eq 0, this representation cannot be uniformly convergent at x=0, otherwise one could compute u(0,t) by inserting the limit x\\\\rightarrow 0 inside the integral of the rhs of and this would yield zero instead of g_0(t). 2\\\\. The above representations are unsuitable for numerical computations. This fact is a direct consequence of 1. 3\\\\. There exist traditional integral transforms and infinite series representations only for a very limited class of boundary value problems. For example, there does not exist the analogue of the sine-transform for solving the following simple problem: supplemented with the initial and boundary conditions . For evolution PDEs, the Fokas method: # Constructs representations which are always uniformly convergent at the boundaries. # These representations can be used in a straightforward way, for example using MATLAB, for the numerical evaluation of the solution. # Constructs representations for evolution PDEs with spatial derivatives of any order. In addition, the Fokas method constructs representations which are always of the form of the Ehrenpreis fundamental principle. Fundamental solutions For example, the solutions of the Laplace, modified Helmholtz and Helmholtz equations in the interior of the two-dimensional domain \\\\Omega, can be expressed as integrals along the boundary of \\\\Omega. However, these representations involve both the Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary values, thus since only one of these boundary values is known from the given data, the above representations are not effective. In order to obtain an effective representation, one needs to characterize the generalized Dirichlet to Neumann map; for example, for the Dirichlet problem one needs to obtain the Neumann boundary value in terms of the given Dirichlet datum. For elliptic PDEs, the Fokas method: # Provides an elegant formulation of the generalised Dirichlet to Neumann map by deriving an algebraic relation, called the global relation, which couples appropriate transforms of all boundary values. # For simple domains and a variety of boundary conditions the global relation can be solved analytically. Furthermore, for the case that \\\\Omega is an arbitrary convex polygon, the global relation can be solved numerically in a straightforward way, for example using MATLAB. Also, for the case that \\\\Omega is a convex polygon, the Fokas method constructs an integral representation in the Fourier complex plane. By using this representation together with the global relation it is possible to compute the solution numerically inside the polygon in a straightforward semi-analytic manner. The forced heat equation on the half- line Let u(x,t) satisfy the forced heat equation supplemental with the initial and boundary conditions , where g(t),\\\\ u_0(x),\\\\ f(x,t) are given functions with sufficient smoothness, which decay as x\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. The unified transform involves the following three simple steps. 1\\\\. By employing the Fourier transform pair : \\\\widehat f(\\\\lambda)=\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\lambda x}f(x) \\\\, dx,\\\\quad \\\\operatorname{Im}\\\\lambda\\\\leq 0; obtain the global relation. For equation , we find where the functions \\\\hat u, \\\\ Q,\\\\ \\\\tilde{g_1} and \\\\tilde{g_0} are the following integral transforms: :\\\\widehat u(\\\\lambda,t)=\\\\int _0^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\lambda x}u(x,t)\\\\,dx,\\\\ \\\\operatorname{Im}\\\\lambda\\\\leq 0, :Q(\\\\lambda,t)=\\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{-i\\\\lambda x}u_0(x)dx+\\\\int_0^t \\\\, d\\\\tau \\\\int_0^\\\\infty dx \\\\, e^{-i\\\\lambda x+\\\\lambda^2 \\\\tau} f(x,\\\\tau), \\\\quad \\\\operatorname{Im}\\\\lambda \\\\leq 0, This step is similar with the first step used for the traditional transforms. However, equation involves the t-transforms of both u(0,t) and u_x(0,t), whereas in the case of the sine-transform u_x(0,t) does not appear in the analogous equation (similarly, in the case of the cosine-transform only u_x(0,t) appears). On the other hand, equation is valid in the lower-half complex \\\\lambda-plane, wheres the analogous equations for the sine and cosine transforms are valid only for \\\\lambda real. The Fokas method is based on the fact that equation has a large domain of validity. 2\\\\. By using the inverse Fourier transform, the global relation yields an integral representation on the real line. By deforming the real axis to a contour in the upper half \\\\lambda-complex plane, it is possible to rewrite this expression as an integral along the contour \\\\partial D^+, where \\\\partial D^+ is the boundary of the domain D^+, which is the part of D in the upper half complex \\\\lambda plane, with D defined by :D:{\\\\lambda\\\\in \\\\mathbb{C},\\\\ \\\\Re\\\\ \\\\omega(\\\\lambda)<0}, where \\\\omega(\\\\lambda) is defined by the requirement that e^{i\\\\lambda x + \\\\omega(\\\\lambda)t} solves the given PDE. Figure 1: The curve \\\\partial D^+ For equation , equations and imply where the contour \\\\partial D^+ is depicted in figure 1. In this case, \\\\omega(\\\\lambda)=-\\\\lambda^2=-\\\\lambda^2e^{2i\\\\theta}, where \\\\theta=\\\\rm{arg}\\\\lambda. Thus, \\\\Re\\\\ \\\\omega(k)<0 implies \\\\sin 2\\\\theta>0, i.e., -\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}<\\\\theta<\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} and \\\\frac{3\\\\pi}{4}<\\\\theta<\\\\frac{5\\\\pi}{4}. The fact that the real axis can be deformed to \\\\partial D^+ is a consequence of the fact that the relevant integral is an analytic function of \\\\lambda which decays in D^+ as \\\\lambda\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty. 3\\\\. By using the global relation and by employing the transformations in the complex-\\\\lambda plane which leave \\\\omega(\\\\lambda) invariant, it is possible to eliminate from the integral representation of u(x,t) the transforms of the unknown boundary values. For equation , \\\\omega(\\\\lambda)=\\\\lambda^2, thus the relevant transformation is \\\\lambda\\\\rightarrow -\\\\lambda. Using this transformation, equation becomes In the case of the Dirichlet problem, solving equation for \\\\tilde{g_1} and substituting the resulting expression in we find If is important to note that the unknown term \\\\hat u(-\\\\lambda,t) does not contribute to the solution u. Indeed, the relevant integral involves the term e^{i\\\\lambda x}\\\\hat u(-\\\\lambda,t), which is analytic and decays as \\\\lambda\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty in D^-, thus Jordan's lemma implies that \\\\hat u(-\\\\lambda,t) yields a zero contribution. Equation can be rewritten in a form which is consistent with the Ehrenpreis fundamental principle: if the boundary condition is specified for 0<\\\\tau, where T is a given positive constant, then using Cauchy's integral theorem, it follows that is equivalent with the following equation: where :Q(\\\\lambda)=\\\\widehat u_0(\\\\lambda)+\\\\int_0^\\\\infty dx\\\\int_0^T dt \\\\, e^{-i\\\\lambda x + \\\\lambda^2 t} f(x,t), :\\\\tilde{g_0}(\\\\lambda^2)=\\\\int_0^T e^{\\\\lambda^2 t} g_0(t) \\\\, dt. Uniform convergence The unified transform constructs representations which are always uniformly convergent at the boundaries. For example, evaluating at x=0, and then letting \\\\lambda\\\\rightarrow-\\\\lambda in the first term of the second integral in the rhs of , it follows that :u(0,t) = -\\\\frac i \\\\pi \\\\int_{\\\\partial D} e^{-\\\\lambda^2 t}\\\\lambda\\\\tilde{g_0}(\\\\lambda^2) \\\\, d\\\\lambda. The change of variables \\\\lambda=e^{\\\\frac{i\\\\pi}{4}}\\\\sqrt k, k>0, implies that u(0,t)=g(t). Numerical evaluation It is straightforward to compute the solution numerically using quadrature after the contour has been deformed to ensure exponential decay of the integrand. For simplicity we concentrate on the case that the relevant transforms can be computed analytically. For example, :f(x,t)=0,\\\\ u_0(x)=e^{-a^2 x}, \\\\ g_0(t)=\\\\cos(bt),\\\\ a, b, \\\\text{real constants}. Then, equation becomes {i\\\\lambda + a^2} \\\\, d\\\\lambda - \\\\int_{\\\\partial D^{+}} e^{i\\\\lambda x-\\\\lambda^2 t} \\\\left[ \\\\frac 1 {-i\\\\lambda +a^2} +\\\\frac{i\\\\lambda }{\\\\lambda +ib}\\\\bigl ( e^{(\\\\lambda^2+ib)t}-1 \\\\bigr) +\\\\frac{i\\\\lambda }{\\\\lambda -ib}\\\\bigl( e^{(\\\\lambda^2-ib)t}-1 \\\\bigr) \\\\right] \\\\, d\\\\lambda . }} File:Figure the countour1.pngFigure 2: The contour L For \\\\lambda on \\\\partial D^+, the term e^{i\\\\lambda x} decays exponentially as \\\\lambda\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty. Also by deforming \\\\partial D^+ to L where L is a contour between the real axis and \\\\partial D^+, it follows that for \\\\lambda on L the term e^{-\\\\lambda^2 t} also decays exponentially as \\\\lambda\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty. Thus, equation becomes 2\\\\pi u(x,t)=\\\\int_L \\\\left{e^{i\\\\lambda x-\\\\lambda^2 t}\\\\left[ \\\\frac 1 {i\\\\lambda + a^2} + \\\\frac 1 {i\\\\lambda -a^{2}} \\\\right] + i\\\\lambda e^{i\\\\lambda x}\\\\left[ \\\\frac{e^{ibt} - e^{-\\\\lambda^2 t}}{\\\\lambda +ib}+\\\\frac{e^{-ibt}-e^{-\\\\lambda^2 t}}{\\\\lambda -ib} \\\\right] \\\\right} \\\\, d\\\\lambda, and the rhs of the above equation can be computed using MATLAB. For the details of effective numerical quadrature using the unified transform, we refer the reader to, which solves the advection-dispersion equation on the half-line. There it was found that the solution lends itself to quadrature (Gauss-Laguerre quadrature for exponential decay of integrand or Gauss-Hermite quadrature for squared exponential decay of integrand) with exponential convergence. An Evolution Equation with Spatial Derivatives of Arbitrary order. Suppose that e^{i\\\\lambda x+\\\\omega (\\\\lambda)t} is a solution of the given PDE. Then, \\\\partial D^+ is the boundary of the domain D^+ defined earlier. If the given PDE contain spatial derivatives of order n, then for n even, the global relation involves \\\\frac{n}{2} unknowns, whereas for n odd it involves (n+1)/2 or (n-1)/2 unknowns (depending on the coefficient of the highest derivative). However, using an appropriate number of transformations in the complex \\\\lambda-plane which leave \\\\omega(\\\\lambda) invariant, it is possible to obtain the needed number of equations, so that the transforms of the unknown boundary values can be obtained in terms of \\\\hat u and of the given boundary data in terms of the solution of a system of algebraic equations. A Numerical Collocation Method The Fokas method gives rise to a novel spectral collocation method occurring in Fourier space. Recent work has extended the method and demonstrated a number of its advantages; it avoids the computation of singular integrals encountered in more traditional boundary based approaches, it is fast and easy to code up, it can be used for separable PDEs where no Green's function is known analytically and it can be made to converge exponentially with the correct choice of basis functions. Basic method in a convex bounded polygon Suppose that u and v both satisfy Laplace's equation in the interior of a convex bounded polygon \\\\Omega. It follows that : 0=v(u_{xx}+u_{yy})-u(v_{xx}+v_{yy})=\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}\\\\big(vu_x- uv_x\\\\big)+\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial y}\\\\big(vu_y-uv_y\\\\big). Then Green's theorem implies the relation In order to express the integrand of the above equation in terms of just the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary values, we parameterize u(x,y) and v(x,y) in terms of the arc length, s, of \\\\partial\\\\Omega. This leads to where \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial w} denotes the normal derivative. In order to further simplify the global relation, we introduce the complex variable z=x+iy, and its conjugate \\\\bar{z}=x-i y. We then choose the test function v=e^{-i\\\\lambda z}, leading to the global relation for Laplace's equation: A similar argument can also be used in the presence of a forcing term (giving a non-zero right-hand side). An identical argument works for the Helmholtz equation :u_{xx}+u_{yy}+4\\\\beta^2u=0 and the modified Helmholtz equation :u_{xx}+u_{yy}-4\\\\beta^2u=0. Choosing respective test functions v=e^{-i\\\\beta(\\\\lambda z+\\\\frac{\\\\bar{z}}{\\\\lambda})} and v=e^{-i\\\\beta(\\\\lambda z-\\\\frac{\\\\bar{z}}{\\\\lambda})} lead to respective global relations : \\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega}e^{-i\\\\beta(\\\\lambda z+\\\\frac{\\\\bar{z}}{\\\\lambda})}\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial w}+\\\\beta\\\\left(\\\\lambda \\\\frac{dz}{ds}-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda}\\\\frac{d\\\\bar{z}}{ds}\\\\right)u\\\\right]ds=0, \\\\qquad \\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}\\\\backslash{0}, and : \\\\int_{\\\\partial \\\\Omega}e^{-i\\\\beta(\\\\lambda z-\\\\frac{\\\\bar{z}}{\\\\lambda})}\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial w}+\\\\beta\\\\left(\\\\lambda \\\\frac{dz}{ds}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda}\\\\frac{d\\\\bar{z}}{ds}\\\\right)u\\\\right]ds=0, \\\\qquad \\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}\\\\backslash{0}. These three cases deal with more general second order elliptic constant coefficient PDEs through a suitable linear change of variables. The Dirichlet to Neumann map for a convex polygon Suppose that \\\\Omega is the interior of a bounded convex polygon specified by the corners z_1,z_2,\\\\dots\\\\ z_n. In this case, the global relation takes the form where or The side S_j, which is the side between z_j and z_{j+1}, can be parametrized by :z(t)=m_j+th_j,\\\\ m_j=\\\\frac{z_j+z_{j+1}}{2},\\\\ h_j=\\\\frac{z_{j+1}-z_j}{2},\\\\ t\\\\in [-1,1]. Hence, :ds=h_j\\\\,dt,\\\\ dz=h_j \\\\, dt. The functions u and \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial w} can be approximated in terms of Legendre polynomials: where for the cases of the Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin boundary value problems either a_\\\\ell^j, b_\\\\ell^jor a linear combination of a_\\\\ell^jand b_\\\\ell^j is given. Equation now becomes an approximate global relation, where with \\\\hat P_\\\\ell(\\\\lambda) denoting the Fourier transform of P_\\\\ell(t), i.e., \\\\hat P_\\\\ell(\\\\lambda) can be computed numerically via \\\\hat P_\\\\ell(\\\\lambda)=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{-2i\\\\pi\\\\lambda}}{-i\\\\lambda}I_{\\\\ell+\\\\frac{1}{2}}(-i \\\\lambda), where I_\\\\ell denotes the modified Bessel function of the first kind. The global relation involves N unknown constants (for the Dirichlet problem, these constants are b_\\\\ell^j). By evaluating the global relation at a sufficiently large number of different values of \\\\lambda, the unknown constants can be obtained via the solution of a system of algebraic equations. It is convenient to choose the above values of \\\\lambda on the n rays -\\\\bar h_j\\\\rho,\\\\ \\\\rho>0,\\\\ j=1,\\\\dots, n. For this choice, as \\\\lambda\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty, the relevant system is diagonally dominant, thus its condition number is very small. Dealing with non-convexity Whilst the global relation is valid for non-convex domains \\\\Omega, the above collocation method becomes numerically unstable. A heuristic explanation for this ill-conditioning in the case of the Laplace equation is as follows. The \`test functions' e^{-i\\\\lambda z} grow/decay exponentially in certain directions of \\\\lambda. When using a sufficiently large selection of complex \\\\lambda-values, located in all directions from the origin, each side of a convex polygon will for many of these \\\\lambda-values encounter larger test functions than do the remaining sides. This is exactly the same argument that motivates the \`ray' choice of collocation points given by -\\\\overline{h}_j\\\\rho, which yield a diagonally dominant system. In contrast, for a non-convex polygon, boundary regions in indented regions will always be dominated by effects from other boundary parts, no matter the \\\\lambda-value. This can easily be overcome by splitting up the domain into numerous convex regions (introducing fictitious boundaries) and matching the solution and normal derivative across these internal boundaries. Such splitting also allows the extension of the method to exterior/unbounded domains \\\\Omega (see below). Evaluating in the domain interior Let G=G(z,\\\\zeta) be the associated fundamental solution of the PDE satisfied by u. In the case of straight edges, Green's representation theorem leads to Due to the orthogonality of the Legendre polynomials, for a given z=x+iy, the integrals in the above representation are Legendre expansion coefficients of certain analytic functions (written in terms of G). Hence the integrals can be computed rapidly (all at once) by expanding the functions in a Chebyshev basis (using the FFT) and then converting to a Legendre basis. This can also be used to approximate the \`smooth' part of the solution after adding global singular functions to take care of corner singularities. Extension to curved boundaries and separable PDEs The method can be extended to variable coefficient PDEs and curved boundaries in the following manner (see ). Suppose that \\\\alpha(x,y)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}^{2\\\\times 2} is a matrix valued function, \\\\beta(x,y)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}^{2} a vector valued function and \\\\gamma a function (all sufficiently smooth) defined over \\\\Omega. Consider the formal PDE in divergence form: Assume that the domain \\\\Omega is a bounded connected Lipschitz domain whose boundary consists of a finite number of vertices connected by C^1 arcs. Denote the corners of \\\\Omega in anticlockwise order as {z_j}_{1}^n with the side \\\\Gamma_j, joining z_j to z_{j+1}. \\\\Gamma_j can be parametrised by : [-1,1] i t\\\\rightarrow (x_j(t),y_j(t))\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^2, where we assume that the parametrisation is C^1. The adjoint of equation is given by The expression v\\\\times-u\\\\times can be written in the form Integrating across the domain and applying the divergence theorem we recover the global relation (n denotes the outward normal): Define l_j(t)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\dot{x}_j(t)^2+\\\\dot{y}_j(t)^2} along the curve \\\\Gamma_j and assume that l_j(t)>0. Suppose that we have a one-parameter family of solutions of the adjoint equation, v(x,y;\\\\lambda)=v_{\\\\lambda}, for some \\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\mathcal{C}, where \\\\mathcal{C} denotes the collocation set. Denoting the solution u alongside \\\\Gamma_j by u^j, the unit outward normal by n_j and analogously the oblique derivative by n_j\\\\cdot(\\\\alpha abla u^j), we define the following important transform: Using , the global relation becomes For separable PDEs, a suitable one-parameter family of solutions v_{\\\\lambda} can be constructed. If we expand each u^j and its derivative n_j\\\\cdot(\\\\alpha abla u^j) along the boundary \\\\Gamma_j in Legendre polynomials, then we cover a similar approximate global relation as before. To compute the integrals that form the approximate global relation, we can use the same trick as before - expanding the function integrated against Legendre polynomials in a Chebyshev series and then converting to a Legendre series. A major advantage of the method in this scenario is that it is a boundary-based method which does not need any knowledge of the corresponding Green's function. Hence, it is more applicable than boundary integral methods in the setting of variable coefficients. Singular functions and an exterior scattering problems A major advantage of the above collocation method is that the basis choice (Legendre polynomials in the above discussion) can be flexibly chosen to capture local properties of the solution along each boundary. This is useful when the solution has different scalings in different regions of \\\\Omega, but is particularly useful for capturing singular behavior, for example, near sharp corners of \\\\Omega. We consider the acoustic scattering problem solved in by the method. The solution u satisfies Helmholtz equation in \\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\backslash {x\\\\in[-1,1],y=0} with frequency k_0=2\\\\beta, along with the Sommerfeld radiation condition at infinity: where r=\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}. The boundary condition along the plate is for the incident field By considering the domains y>0 and y<0 separately and matching the global relations, the global relation for this problem becomes with \\\\Lambda=(-1,0)\\\\cup(1,\\\\infty)\\\\cup{e^{-i\\\\theta}:0<\\\\theta<\\\\pi} and where [u](x,0)=u(x,0_+)-u(x,0_-) denotes the jump in u across the plate. The complex collocation points are allowed precisely because of the radiation condition. To capture the endpoint singularities, we expand [u](x,0) for x\\\\in[-1,1] in terms of weighted Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind: These have the following Fourier transform: where J_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\cdot) denotes the Bessel function of the first kind of order \\\\alpha. For the derivative u_y along \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\backslash[-1,1], a suitable basis choice are Bessel functions of fractional order (to capture the singularity and algebraic decay at infinity). We introduce the dimensionless frequency \\\\tilde k_0=k_0L^{-1}, where L is the length of the plate. The figure below shows the convergence of the method for various \\\\tilde k_0. Here N is the number of basis functions C_m used to approximate the jump [u] across the plate. The maximum relative absolute error is the maximum error of the computed solution divided by the maximum absolute value of the solution. The figure is for \\\\theta=\\\\pi/3 and shows the quadratic- exponential convergence of the method, namely the error decreases like \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\rho^{N^2}) for some positive \\\\rho<1. More complicated geometries (including different angles of touching boundaries and infinite wedges) can also be dealt with in a similar fashion as well as more complicated boundary conditions such as those modeling elasticity. Convergence results for the method and different \\\\tilde k_0.

It was founded in 2002 and granted the status of \\"national chapter in formation\\" by the Transparency International (TI) movement. Over the next four years, Transparency Serbia concentrated its efforts on advocating for the adoption and improvement of anti-corruption legislation through the use of promotional campaigns, draft amendments, comparative legal analysis of legislation. Transparency Serbia further worked to raise public awareness of anti-corruption legislation and identify implementation gaps where legislation was not being enforced. The priorities of work in that period were advocating for the adoption of the Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance (2004), the Law on Prevention of Conflict of Interest (2004), full implementation of the Law on Financing of Political Parties (2003) and the Law on Public Procurement (2002), as well as the adoption of the National Anti- corruption Strategy (2005) and the accompanying action plan (2006). Since October 2005, the Transparency Serbia has been a fully fledged member of the Transparency International movement. This entails participation in the implementation of the TI Global Strategy, a commitment to common goals with other national chapters and the Secretariat (based in Berlin, Germany), as well as the exchange of experiences and best practices in efforts to curb corruption. Nonetheless, Transparency Serbia is registered as a civil society organization (association of citizens) in accordance with Serbian legislation, and as such it exercises full autonomy from the rest of the movement when determining which areas and corruption issues to tackle and how best to approach them. In 2006, Transparency Serbia opened the Advocacy and Legal Advice Center (ALAC) in order to provide assistance to citizens and businesses in cases where they suspect that corruption is a barrier to the exercise of their rights. Transparency Serbia was among the 100 Serbian companies, academic institutions and non-governmental organisations which signed up in 2007 to the UN Global Compact initiative aimed at promoting corporate responsibility. More recently, in September 2015, on the occasion of the International Right to Know Day, Transparency Serbia won the national annual award for special contribution to the promotion of the right to information in Serbia. Organization Transparency Serbia is a civil society organization. Its internal structure includes: • an Assembly, which adopts the most important documents of organization and elect other bodies, • a Managerial Board, which is responsible for strategy and then implementing of planned activities • a Supervisory Board, with a control and oversight mandate. The senior positions in the organization are the President (currently without president), the Executive Director, the Program Director and the Financial Director. According to report on its website, Transparency Serbia is financed solely on the basis of donor contributions to projects, with funding coming mainly from international organizations and foundations, the European Union, and western governments. Activities Currently, Transparency Serbia is focusing primarily on public procurement, the political party funding, conflicts of interest, and continuing its efforts to promote access to information. Among the organization’s notable successes is that its work in the area of financing of political parties resulted in the recovery of EUR 750,000 to the Serbian budget. In 2006, Transparency Serbia found that the Ministry of Finance had erroneously calculated the amount of money political parties should receive from the state budget, and launched public campaign to correct the error. While the Ministry never admitted its error, it issued an instruction to reduce the payments to political parties the following year. (in Serbian only) In 2011 and 2015, TS published the National Integrity System (NIS) Study for Serbia, a comprehensive assessment of how the most important sectors of society and the state can contribute to the prevention of corruption and their respective susceptibility to corruption. The NIS Serbia reports examined the Commissioner for Information of Public Importance and Personal Data Protection, the Ombudsman, the State Audit Institution, the Anti-corruption Agency, the judiciary, political parties, civil society, the executive, the state prosecutor’s office, the police, the legislature, the media, the business sector, the public sector, the Republic Electoral Commission and state-owned enterprises. Overall, the 2015 study concluded that \\"corruption is widespread in Serbia, with most of the available data being about petty corruption and not enough data on the capture of institutions, political protection from prosecution for corruption, abuse of public funds for personal or group interests.\\" According to the report, Serbia's National Integrity System overall is marked by a \\"notable imbalance between the independent and non-partisan institutions on one side and Public Sector, State Owned Enterprises and Electoral Management Body on the other side.\\" It also found that although \\"Serbia has adopted the most important anti-corruption legislation and established institutions for preventing and fighting corruption... practice has proved that some of the laws need to be amended while some of the institutions have been obstructed, ignored or not provided with sufficient resources.\\" Transparency Serbia regularly presents to public TI's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI). In the 2019 CPI, Serbia scored 39 out of a possible 100 and it was ranked 91st among 180 countries and territories. Transparency Serbia also regularly presents to public the TI's Global Corruption Barometer, which measures the direct experience of citizens about corruption. At the presentation of 2016 GCB, TS estimated that there are at least 374,000 undiscovered cases of bribery in Serbia each year. In 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020 Transparency Serbia also presented the Local Government Transparency Index (LTI). LTI ranked all cities and municipalities in Serbia on the basis of transparency. According to these data, the most transparent municipality in Serbia in 2020 was Becej.

She worked as an accountant at Barclays, Arts & Business, Distilled Ltd, SCi Sales Group and the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington until she entered politics after the 2015 General Election. Political career Olney joined the Liberal Democrats in July 2015, soon after the general election, in realisation that she was a liberal dissatisfied with the direction of the United Kingdom. On 25 October 2016, Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith announced his resignation from the House of Commons over his objection to his party's support for a third runway at Heathrow Airport, triggering a by-election in his seat of Richmond Park. Goldsmith stood in the by-election as an independent candidate although he remained a Conservative party member with the support of Nigel Farage's UKIP, who along with the Conservative party, did not put forward a candidate. On 30 October 2016, Olney was announced as the Liberal Democrats' candidate for the by-election. On 1 December 2016, after overturning a majority of over 23,000 votes, Olney was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Richmond Park. She received 20,510 votes (49.6% of total votes), giving her a majority of 1,872 votes (4.5%). She was the only female Liberal Democrat MP in the 2015–2017 parliament. Shortly after her election, Olney ended a radio interview in which she was pressed on her support for a second Brexit referendum. Supporting a second referendum became official Liberal Democrat policy shortly after. In the run-up to the 2017 General Election, Olney was recorded urging Liberal Democrats to vote for Labour MPs in seats where Labour candidates stood a better chance of defeating Conservatives than the Liberal Democrat candidates. Olney referred to the Liberal Democrat candidate for Ealing Central and Acton as a \\"paper candidate\\" and voiced her support for the Labour Party incumbent Rupa Huq. It was reported by the Evening Standard in April 2018 that Olney had been interviewed under caution by the police for allegedly breaking official spending limits in the Richmond Park by-election. The Crown Prosecution Service ruled that there was no evidence and closed the case. In the 2017 general election, Olney narrowly lost her seat to Goldsmith, who stood as the Conservative candidate, polling 45.07% of the vote to Goldsmith's 45.14%, giving Goldsmith a majority of 45. On 9 September 2017 it was announced that she would be taking up the post of chief of staff for Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable. In 2019, she was officially confirmed as the Liberal Democrat candidate for Richmond Park at the next general election. She won the election.https://www.bbc.com/news/politics/constituencies/E14000896 Views On the topic of Brexit, Olney voted against the triggering of Article 50, as she had indicated during the by-election campaign that she would do. She believes another referendum should be held once the exact terms of Britain's exit from the EU have been announced. When challenged about this in an interview by Julia Hartley-Brewer, Olney could not defend her position.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-DHqFikHoA Olney opposes the building of a third runway at Heathrow Airport. Personal life Olney has two children with her husband Ben, a town planner.

Helgenæs lies across the bay to the east, a bit inland to the west is the Marselisborg Deer Park and to the north is the Varna Palace. The beach area is some long and between wide. It is a white sandy beach with occasional rows of boulders extending into the sea, for coastal erosion protection. Ballehage Beach is popular for sunbathing and swimming due to the shielding effect and scenic view of the nearby forest on the steep hillsides to the west. The beach has a single jetty extending some into the sea, offering a platform to jump from or relax on. There are outdoor changing facilities, toilets and storage areas. The Beach is open year-round for everyone at no charge. Ballehage Beach does not have a life guard in the summer but there is a safety station with a lifesaver. It's situated in an area with heavy foot traffic, busy roads and a restaurants. Aarhus Municipality frequently tests the water for bacteria and algae and rates all beaches on a yearly basis. In 2014 and 2015 the beach has received the highest possible 3/3 rating. The water level drops off relatively rapidly and reaches a depth of some from the shore.

The Russian broadcaster Channel One Russia organised their entrant internally. Russia was planned to compete in the first half of the second semifinal on 11 May 2017, until the announcement of their withdrawal on 13 April 2017. Background Prior to the 2017 contest, Russia had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest twenty times since its first entry in 1994. Russia had won the contest on one occasion in 2008 with the song \\"Believe\\" performed by Dima Bilan. Russia's least successful result has been 17th place, which they have achieved in the with the song \\"Kolybelnaya dlya vulkana\\" performed by Philipp Kirkorov. Following the introduction of semi- finals for the , Russia has, to this point, managed to qualify to the final on every occasion. In , Russia was the runner-up at the Eurovision Song Contest, placing second with the song \\"A Million Voices\\" performed by Polina Gagarina. Before Eurovision=Internal selection On 12 March 2017, Channel One announced that they had internally selected Julia Samoylova, with her song \\"Flame is Burning\\" to represent them at the Eurovision Song Contest 2017. She was described as \\"an independent singer, an enchanting girl and a successful competition participant\\". Political issues and travel ban On 13 March 2017, it was revealed that Ukrainian officials had begun an investigation into Samoylova, alleging that in 2015, she had illegally traveled directly to Crimea, a region that was annexed by Russia in 2014, to give a performance. Ukrainian legislation requires visitors to enter the region through points under the control of the Ukrainian government, or risk being banned from entering Ukraine for several years. In response to these actions, it was speculated that Russia's choice of Samoylova may have been a deliberate political statement, having knowingly picked a singer who had performed in the disputed territory; interior minister advisor Anton Gerashchenko stated that he couldn't \\"exclude that actions could be taken by our side to deny her entry\\" if Russia was using the entry as a \\"provocation\\", while the deputy director of ATR, a Ukrainian television broadcaster that serves the Crimean Tatar population, argued that it was a \\"cynical and immoral move\\". Russia has denied that their choice of performer was meant to be a political statement. On 22 March 2017, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) confirmed that Samoylova had been banned from entering Ukraine for three years for illegally travelling to Crimea. The EBU stated that it was continuing to ensure that all entrants would be able to perform in Kyiv, but that \\"we have to respect the local laws of the host country, however we are deeply disappointed in this decision as we feel it goes against both the spirit of the contest and the notion of inclusivity that lies at the heart of its values.\\" On 23 March 2017, EBU offered a compromise to Channel One Russia, in which Samoylova would be allowed to perform remotely from a venue of the broadcaster's choice; it would have been the first time that a Eurovision entry had been performed from an outside venue via satellite.  At Eurovision  The Eurovision Song Contest 2017 took place at the International Exhibition Centre in Kyiv, Ukraine and consisted of two semi-finals on 9 and 11 May and the final on 13 May 2017. According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the \\"Big 5\\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. In spite of the provisional ban, Russia were included in the running order, in the third slot, after Austria, and before Macedonia.http://esctoday.com/143533/eurovision-2017-semi-finals-running- order-revealed Withdrawal On 13 April 2017 EBU said Russia will no longer be able to take part in this year’s (at the time) competition. The Russian state broadcaster Channel One responded by stating that they will not broadcast the contest.

Background  Clifford was a dark bay or brown horse that was perceived by many as ugly and weak. The New York Times said about him, \\"As a yearling he was one of the poorest- looking animals of the lot in which he was offered for sale, and nothing great was expected of him.\\" However, he ultimately became, according to the Times, \\"one of the most brilliant performers the American turf has ever known.\\" Clifford was sired by the stallion Bramble and was out of the good racemare Duchess, who was sired by Kingfisher. He was foaled in Nashville, Tennessee, at W. H. Jackson's Belle Meade Stud. W.J. Cherry purchased the horse for $900 at Belle Meade's auction on April 27, 1891, and sold him shortly thereafter to Clifford Porter, who named the horse after himself.  Career = 2-year- old season  Clifford had an unexceptional maiden season, winning a maiden special weight but not returning to the races that year.  3-year-old season  The biggest and best year for Clifford was the 3-year-old season. In this season he won a total of 18 races from 24 starts, with 11 consecutive races in 5 weeks and carrying over 25 more pounds than his rivals. He also won multiple big races, such as the Phoenix Handicap and the Latonia Spring Prize, and was named American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse.  4-year-old season  As a 4-year-old Clifford went on to win another 10 races from 16 starts, the biggest win being in the Second Special Stakes. He earned his second national championship title as the 1894 American Champion Handicap Male Horse.  5-year-old season  This year Clifford was able to repeat the Second Special Stakes. He also won the Omnium Handicap, Club Members and Oriental Handicaps.  6-year-old season  The 6-year-old season was far from the best year for Clifford, though he still won 3 of 6 races and finished in the money in all 6 races. Notable wins included the Memorial Handicap and a second victory at the Flight Stakes.  7-year-old season  Clifford's last major victory came in his final season at the Long Island Handicap. He retired later that season after coming up sore following his third-place finish in the Omnium Handicap.

It was one of the first songs in the genre later called Neues Geistliches Lied (new spiritual song). The song title was disambiguated to its first line, \\"Danke für diesen guten Morgen\\" (Thanks for this good morning). The song has been included in the hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch. It has been called the best-known German sacred song.  History  Lyrics and music of the song were written by Martin Gotthard Schneider for a competition of the Evangelische Akademie Tutzing for new sacred songs, requesting melodies in the style of jazz or pop. The song won the first prize. It was first produced in an arrangement by Werner Last with a single female singer of the Botho-Lucas-Chor in playback, but labelled the choir on the cover. Ralf Bendix performed the song in 1963 on the Kirchentag in Dortmund for an audience of 16,000. The song then made it to the charts and stayed for six weeks. Danke was published by the in 1962 who reprinted it along with nine other chorale works as Bosses Beste (Bosse's Best) to celebrate its centenary in 2012.  Theme  Danke is in six stanzas of four lines each, three of them beginning with \\"Danke\\", continued by specific things for which to be grateful. Towards the end is the addressee of the thanks named as \\"mein Herr\\" (\\"my Lord\\"), thanked then for the ability to say thanks. The listing of the varied items for which to be grateful is rhetorically an \\"“, showing at the same time a catalogue of things, and the virtuosity of the author to assemble the catalogue.  Reception  When first released, the song was met with protest, with some protesters calling it \\"Negermusik\\" (negro music) and \\"Gotteslästerung\\" (blasphemy); a critic in the weekly Die Zeit wrote of two sins, \\"eine gegen die Musik und eine gegen die Religion!\\" (one against music and one against religion). Sales for the single rose to 700,000 by the late 1960s. The song has been translated into more than 25 languages. It has even been performed by groups and singers who are not affiliated with churches, such as Die Ärzte, Normahl and Mickie Krause. \\"Danke für diesen guten Morgen\\" has been included in the hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch as EG 334. \\"Danke\\" has been called the best-known German sacred song, according to who analyzed its rhetoric.

The flower buds are arranged in groups of up to seven on a branched or unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature flower buds are club-shaped, about long and wide with faint ribs along the sides. The operculum is hemispherical, about half as long as the floral cup. The flowers are a white-cream colour and the fruit is a woody cylindrical, cup-shaped or pear-shaped capsule long and wide with fine ribs along the sides and the valves enclosed below the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus costuligera was first formally described in 2000 by Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill from a specimen collected from the Derby- Gibb River Road, on the road to Wyndham. The specific epithet (costuligera) is derived from the Latin costula, meaning \\"a costule or rib\\" (strictly the midrib of a fern frond) and ‑ger meaning \\"‑bearing\\", referring to the finely ribbed fruit. Distribution and habitat This eucalypt has a limited range but is abundant in a small area in the central Kimberley region of Western Australia, growing in savannah woodland in sandy to loamy soils over laterite. Conservation status This species is classified as is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.

The flight was operated by Alfa Indonesia as a chartered cargo flight with four people on board. There were no survivors among the four crew members on board.  Background  Infrastructure is still a big issue in Eastern Indonesia. For the past few years, the Indonesian Government had only concentrated its development on the island of Java and Sumatra, causing a massive difference in infrastructure of those on the west and those on the east. Gasoline and oil was far more expensive than those in Java. The government reigned by Joko Widodo then started to focus its infrastructure development in eastern Indonesia particularly in Papua, by adding more transportation so essential things like gasoline and oil could easily reach remote areas in Papua. On September 2016, to decrease the oil price in Puncak Regency, the government bought a DHC-4 Caribou to the region.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the crash was a PEN Turbo DHC-4T Turbo Caribou, a de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou modified with Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6-67A turboprop engines. Built in 1971, it first flew in modified form in September 2014. In May 2016 the aircraft was delivered to Indonesia, and entered service in September. It was registered in Indonesia as PK-SWW. It was jointly owned by the Indonesian government and the Puncak Regency local government. The four crew on board were Indonesians.  Disappearance  The Caribou took off from Timika at 07:57 a.m. local time with an estimated time of arrival at 08:22, carrying construction materials. At 08:23, the crew made their first radio contact with Ilaga Tower and reported their position, which was on Ilaga Pass, a valley near Ilaga. After reporting their estimated time of arrival at Ilaga, contact with the tower was suddenly lost at 08:27 a.m. At 09:22 a.m., the crew of another aircraft reported to Ilaga that they had received a signal suspected to have come from the missing aircraft's emergency locator transmitter near Jila. A search and rescue team was quickly assembled by the National Search and Rescue Agency. Local authorities and residents also joined the search operation. However, heavy rain and limited visibility hampered the search and rescue operation and it was postponed. The search and rescue team, consisting of personnel from the Indonesian Air Force, the National Search and Rescue Agency, the Indonesian Army and the Indonesian National Police along with two helicopters, set up three main camps in response to the disappearance. Two fixed-wing aircraft were also deployed.  Discovery of the wreckage  On 1 November the smoldering wreckage was found on the side of Ilaga Pass, at an elevation of in Jila District, approximately from Jila and from Ilaga. The aircraft was totally burnt out with wreckage strewn over the valley. The impact was so severe that there were no chance of finding any survivors. After the discovery, two helicopters were deployed to evacuate the bodies from the crash site and bring them to Timika, where a procession was held to honor the victims.  Investigation  The National Transportation Safety Committee was ordered to investigate the crash and had received the debris of the aircraft. Both the Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder were still missing. On 6 November, both the FDR and the CVR were found and were recovered by search team. Both later were sent to the NTSC facility in Jakarta for further analysis.

Born in Freetown, Bundu started playing youth football for the Craig Bellamy Academy before moving to the United Kingdom to play for Hartpury College. He then went on to appear for lower league sides Newquay and Hereford. In 2016, Bundu signed for Danish Superliga club AGF after a successful trial. After growing out to become an important piece for the first team, he transferred to Anderlecht in 2020. After multiple call-ups for the Sierra Leone national team, Bundu made his international debut on 4 September 2019 in a game against Liberia.

He graduated from Hartpury College in 2016, scoring 18 goals in six outings in the English Schools' FA Cup. Hereford Bundu spent a season at Hereford, winning three trophies and reaching the FA Vase final in 2016. Work authorisation restrictions only allowed him to ply his trade in a club no higher than the fifth tier in the English football league system which forced him to leave Hereford. The goalscorer returned briefly to spectate one of their games, a 6–0 defeat of Bridgwater Town in the Southern Football League. When visiting a friend, he featured for Newquay once, netting two goals in less than thirty minutes as a substitute. Then coach Sash Wheatman acclaimed him as \\"the best player he's had the privilege of watching at this level of football\\", adding \\"it was like bringing on Ronaldo on or Gareth Bale - he was streets ahead\\".

Shafiqa Quraishi, Director of the Afghan National Police Gender Mainstreaming Unit, speaks at an ANP female recruiting conference Embedded feminism is the attempt of state authorities to legitimize an intervention in a conflict by co-opting feminist discourses and instrumentalizing feminist activists and groups for their own agenda. This term was introduced in the analysis of the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, but can also be applied to several historical examples where women's rights were used as justification and legitimization of Western interventionism.  Concept  Originally, the Canadian gender researcher Krista Hunt developed the conceptual framework of embedded feminism to describe the gendered nature of the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and the practice of the US government to justify the War on Terror in the eyes of the public. Hunt defines the concept as the \\"incorporation of feminist discourse and feminist activists into political projects that claim to serve the interests of women, but ultimately subordinate and/or subvert that goal\\". Hunt coined the term embedded feminism referring to the \\"embedded journalism\\" or \\"embedded media\\" approach of the US Department of Defense which became prominent in the media coverage of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The US government attached journalists, photographers, and camera people to military units and granted them unprecedented access to the battle frontline. Although \\"embedded journalism\\" allowed the public to get an exclusive look at the situation in Iraq, this practice was regarded as problematic, as it could undermine the independent reporting and promote the preferences of the government. The \\"far-reaching process of appropriating and subverting feminism through appeals to women's rights\\" that is embedded feminism is different from simple co-optation practices by state authorities in so far as it goes beyond the absorption \\"of the meanings of the original concepts to fit into the prevailing political priorities\\".  Implications of embedded feminism in the fight for women's rights = Historical examples  Krista Hunt argues that appeals to women's liberation have been embedded in political projects for centuries to mobilize feminists and their discourses. A large body of feminist literature has analyzed the gender- related dimensions of (post-) colonial projects where feminists from the Global North were convinced to get involved in order to \\"save\\" other oppressed women. Such rescue narratives generally presuppose a homogeneity of women as an oppressed group, as showed in the work of Chandra Mohanty, and put into play the orientalized nature of the seemingly dangerous \\"brown man\\". Thus, feminism which was incorporated in the modernization and civilization projects of imperial countries is argued to have helped strengthening colonialism and patriarchy instead of promoting women's rights. Feminists also claim that feminist activists and their discourses have been instrumentalized for nationalist projects. During the Nasser era in Egypt for example, feminists are said to have played a major role in helping create a sense of cohesion and bonding and therefore directly contributed to the emergence of a national identity during and after the struggle for independence. Nevertheless, women remained mostly absent from the public sphere of politics once the project succeed.  The War on Terror  The history of the war on terrorism throughout the IR realm consistently showcased a male-stream discipline and a hyper-masculine war hero narrative. In other words, the story is narrated by these men, who hold high positions of power and are fixated to exemplify their heroic qualities to shield women from harm and collide with the world’s difficulties.Shepherd, Laura J. ed. 2014. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations. 2nd Edition. NY: Routledge. (131-140) For example, according to the former US President, George W. Bush, the central goal of the terrorists is the brutal oppression of women…that is the reason this great nation, with our friends and allies, will not rest until we bring them all to justiceShepherd, Laura J. ed. 2014. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations. 2nd Edition. NY: Routledge. (131-140) . This rallying cry by the Bush administration is exactly the narrative that is at question. The time-honored tradition of the good guys defeating the bad guys and protecting racialized women serves to reinforce patriotism and justify violence both abroad and at home. However, how does one exemplify “the bad guys”? By using a gendered lens and looking at the war of terror through a gendered perspective, a simple rallying cry has far more complexities. For instance, there is a power dynamic at play here involving two opposing parties. There is the Western men and women who are deemed to be the saviors. Then there are the Afghan women who needs saving. What does this do? This creates a subtle social construct that the war on terror has created different kinds of men and women based on race, religion and nationalityShepherd, Laura J. ed. 2014. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations. 2nd Edition. NY: Routledge. (131-140) . Having said that, a gendered lens does ignore specific factors. It ignores the power dynamic of liberated white western women against their oppressed Afghan women. Basically, in a war, your race and nationality come heavily into play when it comes to who is deemed to be more liberated. It ignores the historical colonial justification for invasion by proclaiming racialized men are harmful to racialized women. Feminists analyzed Bush’s rallying cry and found similarities to the white men knowing what’s right and saving the racialized women because of perceptions about the racialized men. It ignores the reinforced resistance to women’s rights, whereas men see it as Western imposition. In a war situation, when a Western country tries to help an oppressed nation, it is seen as western imposition because it is as if “the west knows best”, without even being apart or living in an oppressed nation and gives the perception that anything the West does (even empowering women) is treated as imposition. It ignores the obscurity of the reality that white Western women are still being oppressed by the same powers that are trying to liberate Afghan women. Finally, it ignores the overarching point of all these factors which is the creation of a divide and conquer situation of women while also initiating solidarity of all womenShepherd, Laura J. ed. 2014. Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations. 2nd Edition. NY: Routledge. (131-140) . In other words, what all these factors mean is the examination of race, class, nationality, religion and sexuality, we notice factors that were passive such as progressing onward with political agendas that are traditional, old testament and problematic while also trying to play the good guy by silencing other related key issues. In conclusion, Gender has become a topic that is heavily scrutinized but also heavily appreciated and even in the most traditional of scenarios, a gender lens/perspective is very much needed to tackle the real issue of IR. In 2001, the Bush administration began expressing their concerns for the situation of women under the Taliban regime. According to Hunt, it invoked the struggle for women's rights and women's liberation as a rational to justify the invasion of Afghanistan. This increased gender awareness can be interpreted as part of a framing strategy which conflated the War on Terror with the fight for women's rights as a proxy for universal human rights. In the eyes of many feminists, the rescue of oppressed women from the Taliban became the powerful normative legitimation of the invasion which obtained broad public approval. More importantly, this strategy could align itself with feminist groups, that are traditionally pacifist, and could win their approval, thereby removing a critical opposition. The doubts in the government's commitment to further women's rights through war arose due to its lack of interest before 9/11. It was only after the terror attacks, that politicians in the US and in Europe began broadly supporting women's liberation from the Taliban. Despite its usual non-violent stance, the Feminist Majority Foundation (FMF) supporter the policies of the Bush administration and is therefore regarded as one of the most vocal feminist supporters embedded in the War on Terror. Although the FMF saw the government's increased gender awareness as a success of their ‘Stop Gender Apartheid’ campaign, their involvement in Bush's political project was strongly criticized by other NGOs and the critical public because their role was considered to be legitimizing. Hunt sees embedded feminism as a concept that was used to advance the engendered war story of the Bush administration that the invasion of Afghanistan could liberate Afghan women. It has further created a division between feminist groups that supported the war and those groups that refused to get involved in the usurpation of feminism for war. A division also emerged between \\"Western\\" feminists who strived to save the \\"Other\\" women from an orientalised enemy and Afghan feminists who criticized the notion that war could liberate them.  Hegemonic Western feminism and post-colonial critique  Hunt notes that there is a striking similarity between the logic of embedded feminism in colonialist projects and the War on Terror. Both are inherently Eurocentric and present the West as culturally and normatively superior to the \\"unmodern\\" Eastern societies. This rationale would give the West a prerogative to intervene and rescue the \\"monolithic group\\" of Other women who have no agency on their own. Spivak's famous post-colonial critique of the relationship between the colonizers and the colonized subjects in \\"Can the Subaltern speak?\\" condenses this relationship to the strategy of \\"white men saving brown women from brown men\\". This analysis can also be applied to the seemingly neo-imperialist strategy that the US government was pursuing by framing Taliban men in Afghanistan as a danger to women who were presented as victims in need of help from the West. Characteristic for Western hegemonic feminism was the disregard of Western actors for the opinions of Afghan women's groups who argued that a war would certainly have a negative impact on women and fuel fundamentalist sentiments. In the aftermath, Bush's agenda was in fact interpreted as an attack on Islamic values and resulted in a backlash from the conservative forces. Hegemonic feminism also tends to reproduce binary gender roles, especially in the visual representation of women and children as victims of war or oppression in the media. Cynthia Enloe has called this conflation of women and children as victimized subjects \\"womenandchildren\\", a single trope that is being invoked in patriarchic narratives to support state security interests.  Contextualisation  The unique nature of embedded feminism as a state strategy is not just the argumentation based on the representation of women and children as victims but the conjunction of this discourse with the struggle for women's rights. Hunt's concept has made an impact on gender-related conflict research and has been applied to the wars in Iraq, Kosovo and Afghanistan. Embedded feminism can also be used in other contexts such as neo-liberal globalization and can be applied to several other policy fields where pseudo-feminist arguments and feminist groups are misused to legitimize a state-led action or to construct an alternative story.

He is the author of ten novels, and the recipient of several literary prizes. He is the director of three films. He was a columnist on On n'est pas couché. Early life Yann Moix was born on 31 March 1968 in Nevers, France. He earned a bachelor's degree in Philosophy from the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, and he graduated from the École supérieure de commerce de Reims. He subsequently graduated from Sciences Po. Career Moix is the author of several novels. He won the Prix Goncourt for debut novel as well as the Prix François Mauriac from the Académie française for Jubilations vers le ciel in 1996. In 2013, he won the Prix Renaudot for Naissance. Moix directed three films, including Podium, based on one of his novels. Since 2015, Moix has been a columnist on On n'est pas couché, a television program. He also writes for the magazine La Règle du Jeu.Yann Moix, passé de Soral-Dieudonné-Blanrue à BHL, Cinquième Colonne, 27 novembre 2015. Controversies In January 2019, Moix's comments about women over 50 caused outrage on social media in France. In an interview with the French edition of the women's magazine Marie Claire, Moix declared that women in their 50s were “invisible” to him and that he preferred \\"younger women's bodies.\\" He further added that he preferred dating Asian women, particularly Koreans, Chinese and Japanese. In August 2019, his latest novel Orléans was published to critical acclaim, but leaving critics and the public bewildered about the revelations it contains. The book, despite being presented as a novel, is made to look heavily autobiographical, leading the public to think that Yann Moix actually endured as a young boy what the narrator goes through. The book is evidently laced with hate for the narrator's parents, with Moix positionning himself between the lines as a real-life long-suffering victim, who finally dares to tell the truth. Following public protests by Yann Moix' parents and younger brother, it eventually transpired that some of the severe incidents he describes actually took place between him and his brother, who is not mentioned in the book, with Yann Moix as the tormentor, and that several of the revolting situations were in fact made up, \\"heavily exaggerated\\". His brother Alexandre Moix, today also a writer and film producer, whose first book the publication of which Yann Moix had apparently tried to block on the grounds that \\"there can only be one Moix, MOI!\\" [him], told media that his elder \\"prefers to serve his own ambition rather than the truth\\". He also refuses that his older brother should be a flag-bearer for suffering children, since \\"he doesn't care about other people's suffering\\". Right in the middle of this controversy, the French magazine L'Express revealed on 26 August 2019 that Yann Moix, who has always positioned himself as a staunch defender of the Jewish cause and of ill-treated minorities at large, as a student contributed to a negationnist, anti-semitic self-styled magazine. At first, Moix recognised having made the drawings it contained, but strongly denied having written any of these vile, extremely offensive texts, saying that he had merely copied what his fellow editors had composed \\"since his handwriting was the best of the lot\\". The following day, L'Express unearthed a document in which the same texts appear, presumably drafts for the magazine, signed by Yann Moix himself, including a short story about a Jew trying to bargain the price of his train ticket to Buchenwald. Moix relented, admitting that he wrote the texts, saying that today they make him \\"want to puke\\", that he never was anti-semitic, just filled with hate for himself, and that all his life as a grown man, he had worked hard to run away from \\"these toxic geographies\\", feeling \\"liberated\\" now that the story had come out..

Plot Juana is a single Mexican-American mother who lives with her young daughter and widowed father in East Oakland, California. She tries a string of jobs ranging from tending her father's fruit cart to working at Mexican taquerias, and she can slice and dice with speed and precision. After getting robbed while tending the fruit cart, she applies for and is hired as a sous chef at the Japanese restaurant Osaka. She starts off as a kitchen helper, but as her interest in sushi grows, she starts to develop signature sushi dishes on her own time through much trial and error. She also eyes entering a contest called \\"Champions of Sushi,\\" which offers a first prize of 20,000 dollars. When a sushi chef quits, Juana is asked to help make sushi dishes. She improves and impresses the veteran chef Aki, to whom she starts to get close. But the Japanese owner refuses to let her work as a sushi chef to \\"keep the authenticity of the restaurant.\\" Juana, though keeping her head down at first, demands a chance to become a sushi chef, but the owner, Mr. Yoshida, turns her down because she is a woman and not Japanese. She angrily quits and starts working at a car wash, but is selected as one of four finalists in the \\"Champions of Sushi\\" contest, which is televised. She tells Aki the good news and both go on a date, eating mostly Mexican food from food trucks. With the staff at her former restaurant watching her on TV, she puts up a good fight in the contest but ultimately places second. She cries backstage after her defeat. However, she has gained the respect of her fellow competitors that previously mocked her, and Mr. Yoshida. The film ends with a scene of her father and daughter eating at Osaka Restaurant with Aki, and Juana working as a sushi chef. She and Mr. Yoshida drink a toast. Cast Production  Director Anthony Lucero was primarily known for his documentaries and special effects work when he began writing a screenplay about a restaurant dishwasher, Juan, who yearned to be a French chef. In time, the central cuisine became Japanese, and after eight months of research, Lucero realized he had never seen a woman sushi chef. He tossed his 30 page script, Juan became Juana, and sexism, along with national origin, became thematic layers of the story. \\"What is authentic food?\\", Lucero asked rhetorically in an interview. \\"Is it where you’re from? Is it your sex? To make Thai food, do you need to be from Thailand, or is that something that’s learned?...Can you put your own spin on it. Can somebody from Poland make good Mexican food? Is it learned, or is it in their blood? I like people thinking about that.\\" Lucero shot the film, his feature debut, in Oakland, casting in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. He first thought Torres might have been too young for the part, but her acting skills won out. She gained about 15 pounds for the role. Filming took place at Coach Sushi on Oakland's Grand Avenue, the kitchen at the former location of B-Dama on Piedmont Avenue, and the stockroom at Mijori Japanese Restaurant and Sushi Bar. To save production costs, Lucero first thought his actors might learn the craft of sushi making from either YouTube videos or local chefs. Ultimately, he persuaded Andy Matsuda of the Torrance-based Sushi Chef Institute to instruct the cast for free. They trained for two weeks then performed under the occasional supervision of the chefs whose restaurants were used for the filming locations. Reception The movie won ten film festival awards and was nominated for two more. The movie ratings aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes has an average score of 6.7 out of 10, with 94% of reviews being positive.

Founded in 2015 by American journalist Pam Bailey under the umbrella of the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor, a Geneva-based organization chaired by Dr. Ramy Abdu, the project aims at training young youth to write about life in a conflict-ridden area following Israel's operation Protective Edge on the Gaza Strip. It operates by pairing developing English writers in Gaza (ranging in age from 15 to about 30) with professional authors/reporters/communicators, who mentor them on both their language and storytelling skills.

Life  Monika Beisner studied painting at the Hochschule für Bildende Künste Braunschweig (HBK) and - with a scholarship from the German Academic Exchange Service - at the Slade School of Fine Art, London and at the Berlin University of the Arts. A Fulbright scholarship enabled her to study in New York. Since 1970 she has lived as a freelance artist in London, Ratzeburg and on Gozo (Malta).  Work = Children's literature  Early in her career, Beisner was best known for her children's books, such as The Heavenly Zoo (1979)The heavenly zoo : legends and tales of the stars retold by Alison Lurie ; with pictures by Monika Beisner.

London : Cape 1981 created in collaboration with the American writer Alison Lurie. Beisner's book Fantastic Toys (German: Wunderlicher Spielzeug-Katalog, 1973), first published in English in 1975, was selected by New York Review Books at the beginning of 2019 and reprinted in The New York Review Children’s Collection.New York Review Books: Fantastic Toys In September 2014, in an interview with Harvard professor Stephen or Stephanie Burt, an Anglist and Transgender activist, published in The Paris Review, the American poet and writer Matthea Harvey, born in Germany in 1973 but raised in England, named Beisner's Fantastic Toys as the earliest inspiration for her own artistic development. Asked which book to read to understand Harvey's lyrical work, she answered: \\"Fantastic Toys, by Monika Beisner. A book I read over and over again as a child. It features such wonders as a heated sheep toboggan and winged jumping boots. Four years ago, I discovered the reason we had that magical book - my mother had gone to elementary school with Monika. For me, it was as if she’d gone to school with Marilyn Monroe and never mentioned it.\\"Stephen Burt: \\"Mermaid Convention: An Interview with Matthea Harvey\\".

Verona, Edizioni Valdonega, 2007 The three-volume edition of Dante's Divine Comedy also includes an essay on Beisner by the historian and mythographer Marina Warner. She wrote: \\"The hundred miniatures took her seven years to complete and the achievement is dazzling. The present volume reproduces her work full-size, … with no strokes or drawing visible, but a pure glow of dense color, applied with brushes so small they consist of a half-dozen sable hairs. … Monika Beisner has been scrupulously loyal to Dante’s text, rendering gesture and position as described in the poem as well as its unsurpassed precision of spatial, geographical and temporal coordinates.“Marina Warner.

He was interested in Chinese ink wash painting, calligraphy, philosophy, and poetry. From 1988 to 1991 he was a student at the Academy of Fine Arts in Hangzhou.

Working on medium-size canvases, he creates simple compositions: grids of gray boxes centered on monolithic forms and, in one case, a square delineated by four purple brush strokes on a yellow field. The main interest lies in the rich colors stained into the canvas, which glow with Rothko-esque incandescence.

Because the other bones in her arm are still growing, her left arm is growing crooked. This growth disorder is also known as Madelung's deformity. Only, in Kruger's case, the disorder is caused by a trauma and is not a hereditary or congenital defect. Because of these problems she had to undergo multiple surgeries, including an operation to extend the bone, where a pin was inserted to the non-growing bone, with a swivel mechanism on the outside. For three months she had to tighten the screws every day, in order to slightly lengthen the bone. This radical surgery did not do what the doctors hoped for and the doctor declared her inoperable in August 2014. As far as trying to extend the non-growing bone, the bone had been pushed over her carpal bones, which only caused her to have less movement in her wrist. So she has limited movement in her wrist, she can not turn her arm, can not put any pressure on her arm and can not hang on it. Her left arm is now about 7 centimetres shorter than the right arm and her left hand is a little bit smaller than her right hand. She has virtually no strength in her left hand and therefore 70% less strength in her left arm in comparison to her right arm. Until she stops growing she has to have, regular check-ups at the Erasmus hospital in Rotterdam, to see if there is a need for emergency surgery because of the imbalance. But it will never be all right again.  International career  Lisa Kruger made her international debut at the IPC World Championships in 2015.

Moving between academia, commercial and military research throughout his diverse career, he proved to be an enthusiastic leader demonstrated in his numerous directorships, successful fund-raising and his recreational interests of sports. Institutions he worked for included Automation & Robotics Research Institute at the University of Texas at Arlington, Rockwell International, University of Edinburgh, University of Glasgow, GEC, Ferranti, Hansen Experimental Physics Laboratory at Stanford University, Wolfson Microelectronics Institute, Advent Technology Venture Capital Group, Artemis Intelligent Power, Lothian Regional Council and Edinburgh Napier University. He contributed to many academic papers, such as Surface Wave Transducers and Microwave magnetostatics In the 1970s and 80s working for University of Edinburgh he secured funding for Surface acoustic wave devices research and then used them in a Skynet (satellite) receiver which achieved faster synchronisation.  Education  Jeffrey Hamilton Collins was born in Luton, England on 22 April 1930 and was educated at the Royal Grammar School in Guildford, Surrey. He received a BSc in Physics, an MSc in Mathematics and later a DSc all from the University of London. Collins was further awarded an honorary DEng by Edinburgh Napier University in 1997.  Career  He started his technical career in the 1940s as a technician in the Department of Physics at Guy's Hospital Medical School. From 1951 to 1956 he gained experience in microwave tubes and ferrite parametric amplifiers during employment at General Electric Company , Wembley and at Ferranti, Edinburgh. From 1957 to 1966 he was a lecturer in Electrical engineering at the University of Glasgow under John Lamb, teaching and researching in microwave devices. He then took up appointment as a research engineer at the Hansen Experimental Physics Laboratory, Stanford University. Here he was introduced to signal processing capabilities of surface acoustic wave devices, magnetic garnet delay lines for correlation and pulse compression applications. In addition to his technical collaborations with Gordon Kino, Bert Auld, Hank (WR) Smith and John Shaw (HEPL Stanford), he had industrial collaborations with Tom Bristol (Hughes Aircraft), Tom Reeder (United Technologies), Leland Solie (Sperry Corporation) etc. and subsequently he served as Director of Physical Sciences at Rockwell International. Collins was an innovator in 1969 when he, with Ted Paige and Dennis Maines from RSRE persuaded the IEE Electronics Division to underwrite the first International Specialist Seminar on surface acoustic wave devices held in Aviemore, to expand interest in this new technology in the UK and beyond. Further events were held in 1973 (IEE Conference Publication 109), with Collins as Joint Organiser with Tom Bristol and Tom Reeder, and repeated again in 1976 (IEE Conference Publication 144). In 1970, Collins was recruited back to the UK to join the University of Edinburgh to take up a SRC sponsored position as a research Professor, later converted to a personal chair in Industrial Electronics. He brought expertise in the emerging field of surface acoustic wave (SAW) and magnetostatic wave devices, securing significant financial support for the University. His research team comprised Douglas Adam, Barry Darby, Peter Grant, John Hannah, Mervyn Jack, David Morgan, John Owens, etc. with Dennis Lambert leading the device fabrication on Lithium niobate and Quartz polished substrates. Following the Aviemore seminars SAW became a UK major R&D; activity at this time with companion investigations by Charles Sandbank (Standard Telecommunication Laboratories), Cyril Brown (General Electric Company), John Palfreeman (Philips), Ted Paige and Denis Maines (RSRE Malvern) and Eric Ash (University College London). In this era, before digital signal processing, these analogue devices offered a unique way to implement complex receiver designs. His University research team, under John Hannah and David Morgan, designed and delivered a prototype receiver [11] for the UK Skynet military communication system, which synchronised 100 times faster than the existing design. Much of this research was based on spectrum analysis [12] for identifying or acquiring signals, with Collins publishing several papers in the early 1980s on Electronic Support Measures [13]. As Head of the Electrical Engineering Department from 1977 to 1984 Collins also served as the Chairman of the Wolfson Microelectronics Institute (WMI), advising on technology transfer. WMI was floated in January 1985 as the private company, Wolfson Microelectronics. The company's growth accelerated markedly with the move into audio signal processing products with the turnover, in 1998, being £14 million. In 2014 it was acquired by Cirrus Logic for $500 million [14]. Collins was noted within the University for his drive and enthusiasm. He helped grow the Department of Electrical Engineering (EE) academic staff from 10 to 25, re-structured student teaching programmes and set the path towards EE at Edinburgh achieving top category research status in the 1996 and 2001 national assessments [15, 16]. The ultimate success of Collins' 1971 vision to establish signal processing at the University of Edinburgh is still in evidence today [17]. Further a 140-person joint research institute in signal and image processing [18], between the University of Edinburgh and Heriot-Watt University, is the largest signal processing research activity in the UK. In recognition of Collins many research and technical achievements Professor Michael Davies at Edinburgh now holds the \\"Jeffrey Collins Chair of Signal Processing\\" [19]. Collins served from 1970 as technical director of Microwave and Electronic Systems (MESL) [20], where he expanded their commercial capabilities into SAW radar pulse compression filters for new radar receiver designs. This success led to the company merging with Racal Electronics in 1979 and achieving a 1989 Queen's Award for Technological Achievement [21]. Collins was involved with Roger Marriott, through the company, Microwave Exhibition and Publishers, where they organised the first in a series of Technical Conference and Trade Exhibition, MICROWAVE 73, at Brighton [22]. The associated Trade Exhibition was subsequently combined with the European Microwave Conference [23]. Here Jeff honed his skills on document word optimisation with Harry Eustace at the conference's US magazine 'Microwave Systems News' [24]. Collins served from 1979 on the Equipment Sub-committee of the University Grants Committee. This nine person Sub-committee had responsibility for, the distribution of Equipment Funds to every UK University; and to assess whether or not Departments were \\"well found\\". In 1984 he joined the Computer Board who had executive authority for dispersing £30 million p.a. to Universities for maintaining and enhancing their computer resources for teaching, research and library search. In 1987, Collins moved to the USA to take up a position as the founding director of the Automation and Robotics Research Institute at the University of Texas at Arlington. Here he developed this new institute securing the necessary funding from the Texas legislature, further demonstrating his technical and management skills. In 1991 Collins returned to Scotland, where he joined Lothian Regional Council as a consultant on entrepreneurship in their Economic Development Division. He also chaired the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre which attracted the UK National Supercomputing Service in 1994, running today using the ARCHER, Blue Gene and HECTOR supercomputers. Collins assisted Napier University in 1992, when his colleague John Mavor was appointed principal, reorganising of their research and computing infrastructure. Collins then became Chair of the Napier Scottish Electronics Manufacturing Centre securing financial support from Scottish Enterprise before it transformed into the Scottish Advanced Manufacturing Centre in Livingston. Collins also encouraged and assisted Stephen Salter and Win Rampen to form the Edinburgh digital hydraulics spin-out company Artemis Intelligent Power, who secured the 2015 McRobert Award. Collins served here as an advisor until the company was sold to Mitsubishi in 2010.  Recognition  Collins achieved several distinctions: Fellow of the IEEE; Fellow of the Institute of Physics, Chartered Engineer; Fellow of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, where he served as chair of the Electronics Division Board with a local industrial featured chairman's address [25]. He was elected in 1981 as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering and in 1983 Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

She was the first female chief of a university library in Scotland, and one of the first female librarian chiefs of a major UK research university. During her tenure, she played a role in bringing Edinburgh University Library into the digital age. Under her guidance, Edinburgh became one of the first major UK university libraries to tackle issues of automation at scale.  Education  Moon was born in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire. Having receiving education in Birmingham, at King Edward's Grammar School for Girls and went to St Hilda's College, Oxford. She completed her professional training at UCL. She was joint winner of the Cowley Prize for Bibliography in 1955 and became a Fellow of the Library Association in 1958.  Professional contribution  Moon was a co- founder of the Consortium of University Research Libraries (now RLUK) an organisation established to champion the specific issues of larger research libraries. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE), subsequently acting as its curator from 2002 to 2005. Before joining University of Edinburgh in 1980 she worked as a librarian in the universities of Sheffield and Hull, where she served as deputy to Philip Larkin. She became an Assessor to the Curators of the Bodleian Library on its automation plans (1987). At the Edinburgh University Library, she contributed to expansion of the library's collections. She brought the papers of modern Scottish writers such as George Mackay Brown, Norman MacCaig, and Hugh MacDiarmid to the Library alongside the papers of Arthur Koestler, the papers of John Middleton Murry, the Barry Bloomfield and A H Campbell Collections of editions of W H Auden and the Corson Collection of Sir Walter Scott Materials. She had a lifelong personal research interest in writing about women travellers. While working at Edinburgh, she gained a MPhil (Leeds University) writing a thesis about Marianne North. After retiring, she attained a PhD (Hull) for a thesis on Amelia B. Edwards later published as a book, Most Usefully Employed: Amelia B Edwards, Writer, Traveller, and Campaigner for Ancient Egypt (2006).  Legacy  Following her death her extensive personal collection of books was shared amongst the libraries of Edinburgh and Hull universities with a significant proportion being sold for her favourite charity, Christian Aid. The University of Edinburgh named a room in the library in her honour but this room was subsequently lost in a remodeling of the library space.

The area is a compact and somewhat isolated example of a mill village of the mid-19th century; it is roughly bounded by Stowe Street, Graves Brook, and the northbound offramp of Exit 10 from Interstate 89. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history Waterbury's historic Mill Village area is now a quiet residential area, but it was for much of the 19th century a bustling industrial area. Powered by the waters of Graves (or Thatcher's) Brook, a number of mills and small industrial operations thrived into the 20th century, when advances in industrial power and economy of scale spelled their decline. Only one mill building survives: now known as the Waterbury Feed Company, and its accompanying dam and penstock date to about 1830. The other surviving buildings in the district are residential, with most built between 1860 and 1890. with The district is bounded on the north by the bridge carrying Stowe Street across Graves Brook, and on the south by the northbound offramp of Exit 10 off Interstate 89. The ramp and high pass high over the area, with the footings for their bridges partially set on former industrial areas. The district includes houses on North Street, a side loop off Stowe Street, and Seabury Lane, a short spur extending west from North Street. Most of the houses in the district are vernacular, with some indications of either Greek Revival or Italianate styling. The most elaborate house in the district is the Baker house, which features a three-bay Greek Revival temple portico with a recessed porch set under a segmented arch in the gable.

Background The first version of the Ecological Corridors of Tropical Forests of Brazil proposal was developed by a group of consultants at the request of the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment and presented in the first half of 1997. Seven major corridors were proposed: the Central Amazon Ecological Corridor, Northern Amazon Ecological Corridor, South Amazon Ecological Corridor, South Amazon Ecotones Ecological Corridor, Western Amazon Ecological Corridor, Central Atlantic Forest Ecological Corridor and Serra do Mar Ecological Corridor. These corresponded to about 25% of the rainforests of Brazil. Priority was given to the Central Amazon Corridor and the Central Atlantic Forest Corridor, which would test and develop the concepts for use with the subsequent corridors. Proposed scope The South Amazon Ecotones Ecological Corridor was one of five Amazon region corridors identified. It covers the ecotones in the interconnection between the south of the Amazon rainforest and the cerrado of Central Brazil. It is located in the most threatened Amazon region due to the advance of agriculture and ranching in the north of Mato Grosso and south of Pará. The corridor was identified as vulnerable but relatively stable, regionally relevant in biological importance and moderate to high priority on a regional scale. It included six priority areas in three main Amazon ecoregions. The most common forms of vegetation are open rainforest and seasonal semi-deciduous forest. It is threatened by unsustainable logging and continued expansion of monocultures. The corridor has great biodiversity, with an estimated 700 species of birds and 29 primate species. Many species are considered endangered. The conservation units and indigenous territories form four large blocks, which require some form of interconnection. Conservation units in the original proposal included the Jaru Biological Reserve, Cristalino State Park, Araguaia National Park, Cantão State Park (south part) and Ilha do Bananal / Cantão Environmental Protection Area (southwest part). It would also include the Iquê Ecological Station, Serra do Cachimbo State Park and Rio Roosevelt State Forest. The proposed corridor was later expanded to include the Rio Ronuro Ecological Station, Rio Roosevelt Ecological Station, Rio Madeirinha Ecological Station and Apiacás Ecological Reserve. This brought its area up to , including parts of the states of Amazonas, Rondônia, Pará, Mato Grosso and Tocantins.

Founded in 1923 by Seymour Griffin, a New York City cabinetmaker, and James V. Howe, foreman of the machine shop at the Frankford Arsenal in Pennsylvania.  History  Griffin was employed as the in-house carpenter and cabinetmaker at the Hotel Bretton Hall in Manhattan at 2346 Broadway. In 1910 Griffin, having read of the African safari of Theodore Roosevelt and his use of a sporterized Springfield 30-06, decided to turn his own Springfield rifle into a sporter. He purchased a French walnut blank from Von Lengerke & Detmold. In his spare time at the woodwork shop of Bretton Hall, Griffin continued to produce restocked Springfield rifles. Colonel Townsend Whelen who was then in command of the Frankford Arsenal in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. played a large role in the inception of the company. In April 1923 Col. Whelen told Griffin about the talents of the head of the machine shop at the arsenal, James Virgil Howe, and suggested that they combine their skills to produce custom rifles. Also assisting, and providing the necessary startup capital, were James M. Holsworth, and James L. Gerry. On June 1, 1923 Griffin & Howe opened its doors and built rifles out of a New York City loft. In 1927 the Griffin & Howe Sidemount scopemount was introduced. This mount allowed for a mounted and sighted scope to be removed and replaced without the zero being affected. Griffin & Howe was bought by Abercrombie & Fitch in 1930. Griffin & Howe became the main firearm and gunroom of the outfitter for the next 45 years. From the 1930s to the 1960s, G&H; supplied sporting rifles to customers including Ernest Hemingway, Clark Gable, Bing Crosby, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Robert C. Ruark. The storefront used by Griffin & Howe for nearly 30 years In 1935 Griffin & Howe had opened the first shooting school in the U.S., at what is now the Orvis Shooting Grounds in Sandanona, New York. During World War II, G&H; was forced to discontinue its rifle business and turned to making the triggers for US anti-aircraft guns, along with over 50 different parts for the American aircraft industry. In addition to this, the G&H; side mount became the standard rifle mount for the M1 Garand rifle, and by the end of the war, 23,000 had been delivered to the Springfield Armory. In 1976, G&H; was sold by Abercrombie & Fitch to longtime employee, Bill Ward. The company moved its headquarters to Bernardsville, New Jersey in 1987, with the present management taking over in 1989. The company opened two new locations in Greenwich, Connecticut in 1999 and in 2003 at its Shooting School at the Hudson Farm Club in Andover. In 2011 Griffin & Howe moved its gunsmithing operations to a newly renovated, facility to alongside the Shooting School at the Hudson Farm Club. In 2015, the company brought all of its operations to its shooting school location in Andover, NJ.

Description and history The LeFerriere House stands near the northernmost extent of Burlington's Old North End neighborhood, on the west side of Intervale Avenue roughly midway between Willow and Oak Streets. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with irregular asymmetric massing. It has a complex multi-gabled roofline, clapboarded exterior, and a stone foundation. The highest roof ridge is parallel to the street, with forward projecting gabled wings. The front of the leftmost wing has the building's most distinctive feature, a low polygonal turret above a single-story porch with turned posts and balusters. A modern shed-roof ell extends to the rear. The interior retains many original features, including Corinthian columns in the room under the turret and cabinets in the kitchen. with The area where the LeFerriere House stands was rural for many years. Even though a subdivision including its parcel was laid out in 1855, the house itself was not built until about 1888 by F.M. LeFerriere, a French Canadian immigrant. It was originally built as a two- family, and may have been first occupied by extended members of the LeFerriere family. From 1910 to 1961 the house was occupied by two Jewish immigrant families, exemplifying a changing trend in immigration patterns. The house is now divided into three units.

Later that year, Sherburn supported The Saturdays on their 12-date Greatest Hits Live! tour of the United Kingdom, including a live performance of the single at Stafford Grammar School, which increased her popularity in the area significantly. She performed her first headline show in 2016 at The Hare and Hounds pub in Birmingham. Later in 2016, Sherburn released her second single, \\"YOLO\\", which was subsequently remixed by The Wideboys and played on Kiss FM.  Early life  Beth Marie Sherburn was born in Wordsley. From 1995 to 2002 she attended the Straits Primary School. It was here that she realised she wanted to pursue a career in music, after being offered the opportunity by her headmaster to give a rendition of Celine Dion's \\"Falling into You\\" at a nearby secondary school. She remembers, \\"I was such a quiet girl back then, the music definitely brought me out of my shell\\". From 2002 to 2009 Sherburn attended secondary school at Ellowes Hall School. During her time there, she became involved in school choirs and musical productions, playing lead roles in Les Misérables, Fiddler on the Roof, The Sound of Music and Oliver!, in addition to performing in Disneyland Paris.

After the performance, a UK record producer approached Sherburn and invited her to record at his studios in Bath. The following year, Sherburn travelled to Los Angeles, Norway, and Poland, to develop her songwriting ability. It was in Norway that she began to record demos, and began writing and working with the Walt Disney Company. Sherburn won the National Songwriters' Competition. Robin Gibb, of the Bee Gees, was on the judging panel, and remarked that Sherburn's songwriting reminded him of when he used to write songs with his brothers. Sherburn performed her song \\"Starbucks Town\\" as part of this competition. Between 2010 and 2012, Sherburn worked with British guitarist and songwriter K. K. Downing of Judas Priest.

Beth Sherburn In 2015 Sherburn began partaking in a number of events for charity, beginning with an abseil down Fort Dunlop in Birmingham in March to raise money for Red Nose Day. She overcame her fear of heights and successfully completed the abseil, which was filmed live by the BBC. In June of the same year, Sherburn joined other celebrities including Belinda Fenty (The Island), Stevi Ritchie (The X Factor) and Richard Burr (The Great British Bake Off) for the Santander Cycles bicycle race at Jupiter London Nocturne around Smithfield Market. Sherburn has raised a total of over £30,000 for charity to date. In December 2015, Sherburn released a Christmas single called \\"Snow Angels\\", co-written with Eaton. All money raised from the single was donated to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Sherburn performed the single at the Dot Com Children's Foundation Fundraising Ball held at Mansion House, accompanied by a dance by Strictly Come Dancing performers, Kristina Rihanoff and Robin Windsor.  2016–present: \\"YOLO\\" and touring  In 2016, Sherburn performed her first headline show, at the Hare and Hounds in Birmingham. She released her second single, \\"YOLO\\", which she created with producer Ciaron Bell. \\"I was really happy with this song\\", Sherburn remarks. \\"One word sums this up to me: young! It feels like you're on a rollercoaster whilst listening to YOLO – there's so much going on, but that's what life's all about. YOLO relates to everyone. YOLO is about creating amazing memories with friends, finding love and having fun!\\" The track was remixed by The Wideboys. In July, Sherburn performed with her band for MPs from the Conservative Party for a summer marquee. She covered a number of British songs, as well as singing some of her own material.

There are divided opinions about how Lieberath came in contact with the book. One version claims that it lay on a table in the lounge on board, Lieberath sat down and started to read the book and was thus inspired to try Scouting in Sweden.

As an eyewitness to Kristallnacht and a Torah luminary with an all encompassing knowledge of the breadth and depth of Torah scholarship, he made a tremendous impression on the hundreds of students whom he taught over his thirty years as a Rebbe and Rosh Yeshiva at HANC. He authored thirteen books and hundreds of articles on matters related to Jewish law, Talmudic analysis, and Jewish history.  Leipzig (1927–1939)  Rabbi Shlomo Wahrman was born and grew up in Leipzig, Germany. In 1939, at the age of twelve, he and his Polish-born parents and his siblings received American visas and found peace and a life of relative safety away from the clutches of the Nazi regime. In Lest We Forget: Growing up in Nazi Leipzig 1933-1939, published in 1991 by ArtScroll Mesorah Publications, Rabbi Wahrman shares an account of life in Leipzig in the 1930s, portraying the impact of Nazi policies on a thriving Jewish community that peaked at 18,000 in 1935 before declining to around 6,000 in 1939, when Rabbi Wahrman left the city for New York. Rabbi Wahrman concludes his book with the following words: > All these events have delivered a powerful message to me. Any Jewish city > anywhere could potentially suffer Leipzig’s fate, chas v’shalom. There is no > safety and security for us in galus, even in a democracy. The German Weimar > Republic was a democracy, yet it could not prevent the emergence of a > Hitler. When the anti-Semites so decreed, Leipzig, a city of 18,000 Jews, > became Judenrein.  Cincinnati (1940–1955)  Soon after arriving in New York, Rabbi Wahrman's family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he grew close to the legendary Rabbi Eliezer Silver zt\\"l, whom he considered his rebbi muvhak. Due to Rabbi Silver's insistence and encouragement, Rabbi Wahrman honed his writing skills and recorded his copious chidushei Torah. In the short biography of Rabbi Silver that he published, he writes: > I remember at times he screamed at me for lack of understanding--however, > even then I sensed his great love and concern for me and not the slightest > hint of hatred. Rabbi Silver was a man whose very essence was giving to > others--his ahavas yisroel (love for his fellow Jew) knew no bounds…he saw > every Jew as an extension of himself. Rabbi Wahrman studied at several different notable yeshivos in the United States, including the Beth Medrash Govoha in Lakewood, New Jersey, which at the time was led by its founder, Rabbi Aharon Kotler. After marrying Sarah Malka Herskovitz, an orphaned refugee who arrived in the United States after surviving the Holocaust, Rabbi Wahrman also matriculated at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, where he received a master's degree in education.  New York (1955–2013)  He later moved east and became a well recognized mechanech, educator, advisor, talmid chochom and mechaber seforim. He served as rosh yeshiva of Hebrew Academy of Nassau County (HANC) and authored over a dozen books. The SHOA Foundation interviewed Rabbi and Mrs. Wahrman in 1997 about their experiences in Germany before, and during, WWII.  Books  In addition to numerous articles printed under a pseudonym in various Torah journals, Rabbi Wahrman authored a series of in depth analyses of Torah topics called She'eris Yosef . Each of his works received acclaim from leading Torah Scholars around the world, and their letters of approbation are printed at the beginning of each of his books. * She'erit Yosef vol. 1 (New York, 1977) * She'erit Yosef vol. 2 (New York, 1981) * She'erit Yosef vol. 3 (New York, 1984) * She'erit Yosef vol. 4 (New York, 1987) * She'erit Yosef vol. 5 (New York, 1989) * Lest We Forget: Growing Up in Nazi Leipzig, 1933-1939 (May 1991) * Orot HaPesach (New York, 1992) * Orot Yimei HaRachamamim (New York, 1994) * Orot HaShabbat (New York, 1996) * She'erit Yosef vol. 6 - Orot Chag HaSukkot (New York, 2000) * Before the Storm : Memories of a Lost World (2002) * She'erit Yosef vol. 7 (New York, 2005) * Kol Avinoam (New York, 2011)  Torah journals  For decades, Rabbi Wahrman was a regular contributor to Torah journals such as Ohr HaMizrach, HaMaor, HaPardes, and HaDarom.Query Otzar HaChochmah for exact references, as the list numbers over a hundred publications.  Personal library  The first floor of Rabbi Wahrman's house was lined with bookshelves, all packed to the brim. No shelves were double booked, indicating that the books were always in constant use. He had the habit of writing his name neatly on every book, all 1500 of them. The library lacked political or regional boundaries, such that one could find a Likutei Sichos of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, A Yabia Omer of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef and the Teshuvot of Rabbi Moshe Shternbuch of the Edah Charedit all on the same shelf. The bedrooms were not spared from books either, as each bedroom had floor to ceiling bookshelves. There was also portrait of the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, facing a row of books containing Vayoel Moshe of Rabbi Yoel Teitelbaum.

Early life He was educated at Charterhouse and read Classics at King's College, Cambridge, gaining a scholarship and a First in Part I of the degree, but then only a Third in Part II, causing him to switch his attention to music, studying under Edward Dent and Henry Moule. He was a gifted pianist. Career Philip Radcliffe had his first sight of Cambridge in December 1923 when he sat for a scholarship examination. \\"I attended evensong in the Chapel of my future College and can still recall the impact made upon me by the quiet, other-world sound of the choir singing Remember, O thou man.\\" His dissertation continued the work of Richard Terry and Edmund Fellowes on sixteenth and seventeenth century music. Radcliffe became a music fellow at King's College, Cambridge in 1931, and a lecturer between 1947 and 1972. His pupils included Philip Brett, Winton Dean, Jeremy Dibble, Peter Dickinson, Sebastian Forbes and Richard Lloyd. He lived in King's for the rest of his life, never leaving it for more than a few weeks. His academic writings included the books Mendelssohn (1954), Beethoven's String Quartet (1965), Schubert Piano Sonatas (BBC Music Guide, 1967), a biography of John Ireland (1954), and sections of Grove's Dictionary, Denis Stevens's symposium The History of Song, and the New Oxford History of Music. In 1933, at the request of T S Eliot, Radcliffe took over the Music Chronicle section of The Criterion from J B Trend. His compositions include short choral pieces (such as the eight part setting of God be In My Head, Mary walked through a wood of thorn, and The Oxen) liturgical music (The Preces and Responses and Versicles and Responses), songs, and a small number of instrumental works (including the String Quartet in D major, 1939). His incidental music for classical Greek plays included Clouds (Aristophanes, 1962) Oedipus Tyrannus (1965), Medea (Euripides, 1974), and Electra (Sophocles, 1977). Radcliffe was an active member of the Ten Club playreading society whose other members included EM Forster, Donald Beves and Noel Annan. He died in a car accident while travelling with his sister in France at the age of 81, while still an active Fellow of the College.

It protects the Cantão wetlands, an area of igapó flooded forest in the ecotone where the Amazon rainforest merges into the cerrado. Location The Cantão State Park is located in the municipality of Pium, Tocantins. It has an area of . The park is bounded to the west by the Araguaia River, which forms the border with the state of Pará. The Javaés River separates the state park from the Araguaia National Park to the south. It is bounded by the Ilha do Bananal / Cantão Environmental Protection Area to the east. The park would be in the proposed South Amazon Ecotones Ecological Corridor. History The Cantão State Park was created by state law 996 of 14 July 1998 with an area of . The primary purpose is protecting fauna, flora and natural resources with tourism potential to ensure their rational, sustainable use compatible with preserving the local ecosystems. The deliberative council was created in the same law. The boundaries were altered by law 1.319 of 4 April 2002 to contain an area of . The management plan was approved on 25 August 2005. Ordnance 740 defined rules to be followed for the Projeto Quelônios for turtle conservation. The buffer zone was defined in 2005. The revised management plan was approved on 3 August 2016. As of 2016 the park was supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. Environment The Cantão is a broad alluvial plain between the Araguaia River to the west and the Coco River to the east. At one time the lower Coco was probably a meander of the Javaés, in turn a branch of the Araguaia. The region is full of abandoned channels and lakes. Floods connect the lakes in the rainy season for 2–6 months starting in October to form a single body of water, so species adapted to flooding are prevalent. The Cantão holds an ecotone between the Amazon and the cerrado, and includes species typical of both biomes. The lakes are nurseries for fish, turtles and alligators. One survey identified 317 species of birds, including the endemic bananal antbird (Cercomacra ferdinandi) and Araguaia Spinetail (Synallaxis simoni). There is a large population of jaguars (Panthera onca). Facilities The park has an energy supply, guardhouse, visitor center, gazebo, accommodation, parking, staff residence, dock, vehicles and boats. The park supports camping and recreation as well as scientific research. It runs various educational activities such as lectures, workshops, training courses, video shows and monitored trails.

The company now provides farm-to-table foods for consumers in Greater London and surrounding counties, along with ethically-sourced baby & kids, household, pets and deli products. Ben Pugh, a former stockbroker for Morgan Stanley, founded the company in 2012, which is based in London, England. In December 2015, the company had 20 employees, and in April 2016 worked with around 80 food producers. As of April 2018, it was working with 450 producers. Farmdrop has a mobile app that consumers use to interface with the company. History The earliest work in forming Farmdrop began with Pugh meeting with local farmers at their farms to acquire prospective producers to work with the company. Various foods including organic foods can be ordered online and delivered. Farmers and fishermen receive a higher percentage of the retail price using Farmdrop because no middlemen are involved in the supply chain. In March 2017, the company had around 30,000 active users. The company was formally founded by Pugh in 2012 using around £750,000 in funding from other sources. In 2016 the company received £3 million in funding. In April 2017, the company received another £7 million.

Most notable of these are her involvement with his colour vision and viscosity of gases experiments. She was born Katherine Dewar in 1824 in Glasgow and married Clerk Maxwell in 1858. Her contributions are largely recorded in writings on her husband, partly due to a fire at the Maxwell family estate which destroyed many of the family papers.  Early life and marriage  Katherine Mary Dewar was born in 1824 in Glasgow, the daughter of Susan Place and the Presbyterian Rev. Daniel Dewar, Principal of Marischal College, Aberdeen. Little of her early life appears to be recorded. When she was in her early 30s she met James Clerk Maxwell (7 years her junior) during his tenure as Professor of Natural Philosophy at Marischal College (1856–1860). Her father, Rev. Daniel Dewar developed a friendship with James which resulted in his frequent visits to the Dewar household as well as an invitation to join them on a family holiday. James announced their engagement in February 1858 and they were married in the parish of Old Machar, Aberdeen on 2 June 1858. The couple did not have children.  Scientific contribution  Before and during their marriage Katherine aided James in his experiments on colour vision and gases. Katherine's observations were valuable to James' scientific work. In his publication in the Philosophical Transactions titled On the Theory of Compound Colours, and the Relations of the Colours of the Spectrum, James records the observations of two individuals. He reveals himself as the first observer labeled J, but describes the second individual anonymously as \\"another observer (K).\\" Lewis Campbell confirms that the observer K was indeed Katherine.  Colour vision experiments  This is a diagram of the instrument used by James and Katherine in the Colour Light experiments as it appeared in James Clerk Maxwell's Philosophical Transactions publication titled \\"On the Theory of Compound Colours, and the Relations of the Colours of the Spectrum.\\" Vol. 150 pp. 57–84. 1 January 1860. The apparatus used in the colour vision experiments is depicted in Fig. 1. It was constructed by joining a box of (AK) with a box of (KN) at a 100-degree angle. A mirror at M reflects light coming through the opening at BC towards a lens at L. Two equilateral prisms at P diffract light coming from the three slits at X, Y, and Z. This illuminated the prisms with the combination of the spectral colors created by the diffraction of the light from the slits. This light was also visible through the lens at L. The observer then peered through the slit at E while the operator adjusted the position and width of each slit at X, Y, and Z until the observer could not distinguish the prism light from the pure white light reflected by the mirror. The position and width of each slit was then recorded. James and Katherine performed this experiment in their home. Their neighbours supposedly thought that they were \\"mad to spend so many hours staring into a coffin.\\" Katherine's observations differed from Jame's on several accounts. James described these differences in section XIII of his publication, noting that there was a \\"measurable difference\\" between the colors perceived by each observer. Campbell also cites readings by C.H. Cay to be different from Katherine's, although a third observer is not listed in this particular Philosophical Transactions publication. This led him to develop his theory of colour vision and to discover the commonly occurring blindness of the Foramen Centrale to blue light.  Viscosity of gas experiments  In a letter to P.G. Tait, James Clerk Maxwell wrote about Katherine's contribution to measurements of gaseous viscosity associated with his paper \\"On the Dynamical Theory of Gases\\", saying that Katherine \\"did all the real work of the kinetic theory\\" and that she was now \\"...engaged in other researches. When she is done I will let you know her answer to your inquiry [about experimental data]\\". Some of the more arduous work performed by Katherine in these experiments involved keeping a fire continuously stoked for hours on end for the purpose of producing steam from a kettle. A fire at Glenlair destroyed the majority of Maxwell's papers, which has made it more difficult for historians to reconstruct further details of Katherine Clerk Maxwell's scientific contribution.  Personal life  An image showing Katherine Clerk Maxwell (seated), with her husband James Clerk Maxwell and the couple's dog Toby. After the merger of Marishal College with Kings College to form the new University of Aberdeen in 1860, James Clerk Maxwell lost his position and the couple moved to London for five years whilst Katherine's husband took up the role of Natural Philosophy Chair at King's College. Katherine nursed her husband through smallpox in September 1860 at the Maxwell family estate, then through erysipelas following a riding incident in September 1865. The Maxwells were avid riders. In a letter to a friend and colleague, James mentioned their regular outings to the Brig of Urr, mounted on their horses Darling and Charlie. Charlie was a bay pony that James bought for Katherine at a horse fair where James allegedly contracted smallpox. Charlie was named after Charles Hope Cay, the very friend to whom James wrote. The couple moved to the Maxwell estate, Glenlair, in around 1865, with James using this time to write up some of his key work. In 1871 James Clerk Maxwell became Cambridge University's first Cavendish Professor of Experimental Physics. During this time the couple lived in Cambridge but continued to spend summers in Glenlair. Katherine had a number of health issues and suffered a prolonged illness in 1876, which her husband nursed her through. Despite this, and Katherine's role in caring for her husband, Margaret Tait (wife of P.G. Tait) is said to have accused Katherine of derailing her husband's career because of her illness and James Clerk Maxwell's care for her. An image of Katherine Clerk Maxwell's grave in Parton, Dumfries and Galloway, where she is buried with her husband James Clerk Maxwell and his parents. Katherine was widowed when James Clerk Maxwell died of stomach cancer on 5 November 1879. On the day of his death James expressed concern for Katherine's health. Little is known about Katherine's life during the seven years between her husband's death and her own. She died in Cambridge on 12 December 1886 and is buried alongside her husband in Parton, Dumfries and Galloway. She did not have any children.

It was known as Fashion Connection between 1988 and 2000, Singapore Fashion Week between 2001 and 2008, and Audi Fashion Festival Singapore after gaining titular sponsorship from Audi in 2009.FASHION FESTIVAL 2001 POISED TO POSITION SINGAPORE AS A REGIONAL FASHION CAPITAL . Asiatraveltips.com (20 November 2000). The event was again rebranded as Singapore Fashion Week in 2015 despite still being known as the 'Audi Fashion Festival Singapore'. The event is not to be confused with the Singapore Fashion Festival, which also ran between 2001 and 2008, but was supported by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB). The Singapore Fashion Festival eventually became the Asia Fashion Exchange (AFX) in 2010, and hosts the Audi Fashion Festival Singapore as part of its flagship event. The last event is expected to be in 2017 as current event chairman Tjin Lee is setting her sights on expanding regionally.  2009 - 2014  Audi Fashion Festival (AFF) was a fashion festival that took place in May every year from 2009 to 2014. Incepted in 2009, it replaced the Singapore Fashion Week, and welcomed consumers to conventionally by-invite only shows for media and trade. It was held at Tent@Orchard in the heart of the Orchard Road fashion belt from 2009 to 2012, and 2014. In 2013, AFF moved to Marina Promenade. Organized by Mercury Marketing & Communications, AFF was the first privately funded consumer fashion event, with Audi as the titular sponsor. It was a high-profile platform for both international and Asian emerging and established designers. During its run, the festival showcased collections by a host of top international designers and labels such as Prabal Gurung, Oscar de la Renta, Christian Lacroix, Vivienne Westwood, Gareth Pugh, Marc by Marc Jacobs, Missoni, Ungaro, Erdem, DSquared, Roberto Cavalli, Mugler, Zac Posen, Roland Mouret, Carolina Herrera, Tsumori Chisato, Peter Pilotto and Hussein Chalayan. On top of international designers, Singaporean designers showcased at AFF. The number of local labels doubled from 2013 to 2014, with four local labels – Hansel, Ong Shunmugam, Exhibit, and Saturday – showcasing at Audi Fashion Festival 2014.  2009 Audi Fashion Festival  The 2009 fashion festival took place at the TENT@ORCHARD from 6 May to 10 May 2009. Singapore's fashion elite gathered for the nation's biggest scale fashion event at the newly minted Audi Fashion Festival – marking the first ever privately owned fashion festival. Organized by Mercury Marketing and Communications, the festival welcomed fashion's biggest and hottest names including Christian Lacroix, Gareth Pugh, Vivienne Westwood, Jacquetta Wheeler, Ashley Isham, RAOUL, Marc by Marc Jacobs, Mango, and Singapore's creative crop from BlackMarket, Nicholas by Nic Wong and Hansel by Jo Soh. ‘Driving Innovation and Inspiration' was the theme for the inaugural Audi Fashion Festival 2009 and the festival certainly lived up to that note with a spectacular string of shows that inspired, dazzled and rocked the region. There were many firsts; first haute couture collection to be showcased on such a grand scale on Orchard Road, Gareth Pugh first catwalk presentation of his Fall 2009 women's and men's collection, and Ashley Isham's debut of ethereal yet elegant bridal gowns. The five show-filled days of Audi Fashion Festival drew a strong 7000 guests, with a sell-out six ticketed shows. Audi Fashion Festival 2009 wrapped up as the most glamourous and dazzling event of the fashion and social calendar with Vivienne Westwood's Anglomania Autumn/Winter 09-10 collection. Dame Vivienne Westwood was also awarded Audi Lifetime Achievement Award, with Commercial Director Giuseppe Aragoni in town to accept on her behalf.  2015 - present  In 2015, the event was rebranded as Singapore Fashion Week (SGFW) although it is still referred to as the Audi Fashion Festival Singapore. The event is organized by Mercury Marketing & Communications. An excerpt of the website states \\"casting a spotlight on Asian talent, SGFW is a showcase of world-class collections by top and emerging designers and labels and is the only fashion week in the world that feature established and emerging regional and homegrown designers and labels alongside the world’s most iconic international designers.\\"  Singapore Fashion Week 2015  The fashion event claimed the iconic name Singapore Fashion Week and returned with a revamped format. Building on eight successful editions as a consumer-centric fashion festival, SGFW broadened its scope to include thought-leadership initiatives and industry development. One initiative was the SGFW Fashion Talk Series – a series of thought-leadership and industry talks organized in partnership with LASALLE College of the Arts. In 2015, SGFW introduced strategic global alliances. SGFW partnered with the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), which saw CFDA members Diane von Furstenberg and Thakoon Panichgul showcasing their latest collections as part of the tie up. SGFW's partnership with UK Trade & Investment (UKTI) saw British designer and UK’S \\"GREAT\\" campaign ambassador Victoria Beckham presenting her Autumn/Winter 2015 collection at SGFW 2015. To support homegrown talent, SGFW introduced Fashion Futures, a new talent development programme to internationalize Singapore designers. Singaporean designers Priscilla Shunmugam of Ong Shunmugam, Sabrina Goh of ELOHIM, and Chelsea Schott-Blackhall of Dzojchen presented as part of the pilot edition of Fashion Futures.  Singapore Fashion Week 2016  The Singapore Fashion Week returns in 2016 with a new date, location and initiatives. The 2016 edition took place in October instead of May, from 26 to 30 October, in order to align with international Fashion Weeks. The new date allows designers to showcase Spring/Summer collections that are more suited to the region's tropical climate instead of Fall/Winter collections that were previously showcased when the festival was held in May. Further, a six-month calendar of fashion and industry-related activities made accessible to the public would culminate in the Singapore Fashion Week held in October. SGFW 2016 was held at National Gallery Singapore, housed in two national monuments in the heart of the Civic District – the former Supreme Court and City Hall. At the new location, SGFW would feature a curved runway with more than 350 front row seats, instead of conventional theatre-style seating, for a novel guest experience. The 2016 edition will include Digital Fashion Week (DFW) after its acquisition by SGFW, which would welcome a larger digital presence for SGFW. DFW is a designer showcase formerly targeted at young designers with an emphasis on online and social media. It has supported more than 50 local designers through fashion events and runway shows held annually in Singapore and Bangkok. Viewers can enjoy 360° virtual reality and live streaming of SGFW content via the Digital Fashion Week’s online portal. In addition to SGFW Gallery, SGFW introduced Singapore Fashion Week Access – an industry-support platform that aims to support the Singapore fashion industry by providing designers and businesses opportunities to exhibit their collections through smaller scale, flexible-format fashion presentations. SGFW turns the spotlight on Asian talents with the participation of top names in fashion such as Chinese couturier Guo Pei, Indian-American fashion designer Naeem Khan, and London-based designer Han Chong who is behind contemporary womenswear label Self-Portrait. For the first time ever, a Singaporean designer – Max Tan of MAX.TAN – will open the fashion week at SGFW Access.  Singapore Fashion Week 2017  The last Singapore Fashion Week took place on 26 to 28 Oct 2017.

He was also a grand duke and commercial legate at the Russian court. However, in July 1762 his friend, the Czar Peter III, was assassinated in connection with a successful power-grab involving his estranged wife. Poel hurriedly left Saint Petersburg and relocated to Hamburg, dividing his final years between the Hanseatic City and the several landed estates he acquired in northern Germany. Life=Family provenance and childhood Jan Poel is believed to have been born in the Netherlands. Neither the precise date nor the place of his birth have been confirmed, however. Both his family traditions and his own education prepared him for an itinerant life. * His paternal grandfather, Gerrit Claesz Pool/Poel (1651-1710) was an Amsterdam ship builder and ships' carpenter who taught his ship building skills to Peter the Great in Zaandam when the future czar made an extensive educational visit to the west. Gerrit Claesz Pool had later taken his elder son to Saint Petersburg where they were involved in establishing an imperial ship building business. * His father, also called Jan Pool/Poel, was a younger son to the czar's ship builder: he had been baptised at Amsterdam in 1682 and probably died at Saint Petersburg where, like his elder brother, he worked as a shipbuilder to the czars. Jan grew up in Leiden, living for some time with a Monsieur Luzac, the French born proprietor of a francophone Leiden Newspaper. He received a good education, mastering various European languages and becoming fluent in Dutch, Russian and German. Merchant Jan Poel learned his mercantile skills working in Saint Petersburg with the \\"van Brienen\\" firm, of which he later became a part-owner. One source mentions that in 1742 he was working as a book keeper for Caspar Bokman, a merchant originally from Hamburg and another member of the western merchant community which had been a prominent feature of the Russian capital since the time of Peter the Great. A characteristic of the western expatriate community was a propensity to cement business relationships through marriage, and at some point between 1750 and 1752 Jan married, as his second wife, Magdalena van Brienen, a daughter of Rutger van Brienen and sister to another member of the merchant community, Abraham van Brienen. His first marriage had produced two children, and by his marriage to Magdalena he fathered a further five, including Magdalena (later Magdalena Pauli), remembered primarily as a socially prominent philanthropist, and Piter, remembered primarily as a diplomat. As he progressed in the business Jan took on a branch of the \\"van Brienen\\" firm in Arkhangelsk to the north, where he amassed a substantial fortune. Palace coup Back in Saint Petersburg, the Grand Duke Peter, who since 1739 had included the dukedom of Holstein-Gottorp among his titles, became the Godfather of Jan's son Piter, born in 1760. The Grand Duke Peter was also next in line to become the Russian czar, and throughout the later 1750s it was apparent that the health of the Empress Elizabeth was in terminal decline. As her death approached Peter mandated Jan Poel to become his effective viceroy in Holstein-Gottorp. Of particular concern to the future czar was a major canal building project which would call for close oversight. Poel prepared to relocate to Holstein, liquidating his assets in Saint Petersburg in preparation for the move. The czar came to the throne in January 1762, but his assassination six months later called for a rapid change of plan. Czar Peter was succeeded by his estranged widow, remembered by history as Catherine the Great, but she had very little interest in Holstein-Gottorp, and for several years the legal status of the duchy would remain unclear. Jan Poel no longer saw a future for himself in Holstein-Gottorp, but there was a pressing need to relocate, and supported by the considerable wealth that he had accumulated he now moved with his family to Hamburg. Rich land owner In 1766 Jan Poel purchased a number of farm-estates in Mecklenburg. Two of these, both near Wismar, were at Zierow and at Naudin (today a quarter in Bobitz). Further to the west, in Holstein, he also purchased estates at Rethwisch, in the district of Stormarn, and at Rastorf. During his final years he tended to spend his summers in Zierow and his winters in Hamburg, where he lived in some style, creating a stir with his large four-horse carriage. Already twice widowed, on 6 August 1767 he married for a third time. The ceremony took place in the chapel of the German Reformed Church in Hamburg. His third bride was the widow Judith Sarry (born Judith Schreur van Hoghenstein). This marriage was childless, and Judith died in February 1769. Jacobus \\"Jan\\" Poel himself died at Zierow in the late summer of 1775. He was buried on 25 September 1775 at Proseken (today a quarter of Gägelow, a short distance to the west of Wismar).

Community-led housing is where people and communities play a leading role in addressing their own housing needs. The route taken depends on things like the nature of the demand, available resources, location and type of activity. Approaches encompass new build, regeneration and the use of existing buildings. Community-led housing groups may form on the basis of a geographical connection or something else they have in common (e.g. older people, LGBT groups etc.). There is no definitive definition of the term, yet there have been attempts to provide clarity by identifying key principles which underpin all community-led housing activity.  Community-led housing in the UK  In the UK, community-led housing currently constitutes less than 1% of housing stock. There have been attempts to stimulate increased growth, with mixed results. The most commonly known forms of community-led housing include: community land trusts, housing cooperatives, self–build, cohousing, and self- help housing. A range of legal models are in use in the UK to enable the delivery of community-led schemes. There is currently no legal definition of community-led housing. A draft definition was developed and presented for discussion in the House of Lords in March 2016 in relation to the Housing and Planning Act, where it was not progressed. Legal models Common legal structures used to provide community-led housing in the UK include: * Charitable incorporated organisation (CIO) * Community association * Community benefit society (CBS or Bencom) * Community charitable trust * Community housing association * Community interest company (CIC) * Community land trust (CLT) * Company limited by guarantee * Council TMO * Development trust * Housing association TMO * Housing cooperative * Industrial and provident society * Mutual home ownership society * Organisations with charitable status  Community-led housing worldwide  Community-led housing currently delivers thousands of homes worldwide. The term has various manifestations, which include: * Social production of habitat (internationally used) * Projets d'habitat participatif (France) * Habitat groupé (Belgium) *Baugruppen (Germany)  Key principles  A volunteer working to renovate an empty home with Canopy Housing, a community-led housing project in the North of England In 2016 key principles for community-led housing were developed collaboratively with several organisations representing community-led housing as part of an alliance building activity coordinated by Building and Social Housing Foundation (BSHF). The key principles are: * The community is integrally involved throughout the process in key decisions like what is provided, where, and for who. They don't necessarily have to initiate the conversation, or build homes themselves. * There is a presumption that the community group will take a long term formal role in the ownership, stewardship or management of the homes. * The benefits of the scheme to the local area and/or specified community group are clearly defined and legally protected in perpetuity. Individual schemes are designed to fit the needs of the communities involved and achieve specific outcomes and wider benefits.  Benefits  Identified benefits of community-led housing include: * Increased community confidence and cohesion: These are developed through the opportunity for the community to work together to influence their housing as formal stakeholders. * Skills development and employment: This can include the development of practical skills that help to develop the homes, such as plastering, plumbing and tiling. It can also include skills such as project management and community mobilisation in the planning of homes. * Addressing social challenges: Community-led housing projects can help to address social problems such as homelessness and loneliness. For example, certain projects help to tackle the challenges of supporting an elderly population. * Provision for a long-term legally protected benefit to the local or specified community via retained income from the housing provided.

Personal life Alatorre was born in the state of San Luis Potosi in Mexico, in 1927, into a large family with many women. Her father was an officer in the union of railway workers. Alatorre married into a wealthy family when she was 19. Along with her husband and her sister, she migrated to the United States and moved to the Greater Los Angeles Area when she was 27 years old. In California her husband did not get the job he had moved for. There she began work as a model for bathing suits, for a factory which made pieces for Rosemary Reid. She also worked as a supervisor in the same factory, and her husband worked in the garment industry as well. She separated from her husband in the late 1950s, and never had any children: she spent most of her time with her work in labor organizing. She lived with her sisters, who also worked with her. The city of Pacoima was her home for over fifty years, until she moved back to San Luis Potosí two years before her death. She died in March 2020; the causes of her death were unknown. Labor organizing Alatorre's father had raised her on stories of labor activism, and she was radicalized by the plight of migrant workers that she observed when traveling to the United States. Her work in the clothes-manufacturing company led Alatorre to build connection to other workers in the garment industry. Known for her ability to build personal relationships, she became a liaison between the garment workers' union and the industry that they worked for. She became further involved with labor organizing, and worked with several unions, including the Teamsters, the United Auto Workers, the Maritime Union, and the United Farm Workers. During this period, she also worked in a pharmaceutical plant. Through her work with labor organizations, she met fellow activist Bert Corona. The two of them made connections to the Hermandad Mexicana Nacional (HMN), which was at the time one of the only organizations working for Mexican-Americans that was also run by Mexican-Americans. The HMN was facing difficulties due to the activities of the House Un-American Activities Committee, so Corona and Alatorre took charge of the organization, and in 1968 moved it to Los Angeles, where its local chapters came to be known as Centro de Acción Social Autónomo, or CASA. CASA began to work for the rights of immigrant workers, and also provided them social services, including legal help and education. It also advocated for policies in their favor. Both organizations working for the rights of undocumented immigrants during a time when most mainstream Latino organizations were unwilling to do so. HMN and CASA organized protests against raids targeting immigrant workers, and also offered social and legal support. Among their projects was persuading the media to use the term \\"undocumented immigrant\\" in place of \\"illegal alien\\". Other activism In 1977 CASA worked with several other Latino organizations to advocate for amnesty to undocumented immigrants and against sanctions applied to employers who hired them. Alatorre and Corona constituted a more radical voice within that movement, arguing that undocumented immigrants had earned the right to work in the US, and that they ought to be welcomed. This stance was unusual relative to the views of most Mexican-American organizations, which supported a policy of \\"Americanization\\". Alatorre played a significant role within CASA, being responsible for administrative tasks and choosing to remain largely \\"behind the scenes\\". Through her work with CASA and elsewhere, Alatorre became known as a prominent activist for civil rights. In 1968, Corona and Alatorre also became involved in Robert F. Kennedy's primary campaign for California's Senate seat. A few years later Alatorre and Corona were responsible for leading a change in the way the US Democratic Party perceived issues of immigration, partly through their work with labor unions. Alatorre also participated in renter's strikes, protested the Ku Klux Klan in San Diego, and advocated for more Latino representation on television. Legacy An obituary for Alatorre in the Los Angeles Times stated that the message she sought to convey through her activism in the 1950s—that illegal immigrants also deserved human rights—\\"went from heresy to the mainstream and forever altered politics in California and beyond\\". Rodolfo Acuña, a scholar of Chicano history, called her an \\"extraordinary person\\" who \\"never wavered from her message\\" and \\"never compromised.\\" California State Senator Maria Elena Durazo stated that she was inspired to enter politics by Alatorre because she \\"said regular, simple things that people believed in\\".

The film stars Gerard Butler and Peter Mullan. It was released in the UK in March 2019, after an earlier US release.  Plot  Three men begin their six-week shift tending to the remote Flannan Isles Lighthouse. Donald (Connor Swindells), the youngest, is inexperienced and learning the trade from James (Gerard Butler) and Thomas (Peter Mullan). James has a family waiting for him on the mainland and Thomas is still mourning the loss of his wife and children. After a storm, the men discover a boat, a body, and a wooden chest washed ashore. Donald descends the cliffs to check on the man, who appears lifeless. As they are hauling up the chest, the man awakens and attacks Donald. In self-defence, Donald bashes the man's head with a rock and kills him. Thomas is against opening the chest, but opens it alone, and keeps what he saw to himself. Eventually the other two give in to their curiosity and find several gold bars inside. Urging caution and secrecy, Thomas proposes they dispose of the body, sneak the gold back to the mainland, and lay low for a year before splitting their shares. Another boat arrives with two strangers, Locke (Søren Malling) and Boor (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson), crewmates of the deceased. They interrogate Thomas, who claims the body and cargo have been reported and taken away, as per protocol. Locke and Boor leave, but attempt to contact the lighthouse by radio. Thomas and James are unable to respond due to their malfunctioning radio, revealing their lie. The strangers return with a fiery vengeance, circling the island until nightfall. In a violent struggle, James manages to strangle Boor and Donald kills Locke, using the woolding. Sensing another intruder outside, the keepers chase him through the darkness and James slashes him with a hook. He is horrified to discover he has killed a young boy, reminding him of his son. After dumping all four dead bodies into the sea, the three men try to endure their remaining time on the island, despite mounting distrust and tension. James in particular becomes unhinged, secluding himself in the tiny chapel nearby. Donald grows uneasy and insists that he and Thomas leave with the gold. James suddenly reappears, apologising for his behaviour. Once Donald and Thomas have let their guards down, James locks Thomas in the pantry and strangles Donald. Thomas breaks free and subdues James by knocking him out. Finally ready to depart the island, Thomas and James board the boat with the gold. After throwing Donald's body overboard, James tells Thomas he cannot bear to live with his guilt and lowers himself into the water. He calls for Thomas, who helps him drown. Thomas holds James's head under water then sails on alone.

In 1945, Hines, along with her father, Dr. T. Henderson Kerr, were plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the Enoch Pratt Free Library for their denial of her application for their library training course. Hines was born in Baltimore and graduated Frederick Douglass High School. After graduating from Coppin Normal School (now Coppin State University), Hines was employed as a teacher in segregated Baltimore schools. In 1943, after working as a teacher for five years, Hines saw an advertisement in the Baltimore Sun for a position for a \\"colored\\" assistant for the library, but she was denied due to her race. The Pratt had previously hired two African-American library assistants to work at a branch located in a predominantly African-American neighborhood, however they did not receive training through the library course. After being persuaded by Carl J. Murphy of the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper and Lillie Mae Carroll Jackson of the Baltimore branch of the NAACP, Hines, along with her father, sued the library. They were represented by William A.C. Hughes and Charles Hamilton Houston. Hughes and Houston argued that the library, as public institution which received funds from the city, were in violation of the law for barring tax- paying African-Americans from the course. The case was initially dismissed because the judge argued that the library was a private corporation, not a governmental agency. However, after the case was appealed to the 4th U.S. District Court of Appeals, the court ruled that the library was an \\"instrumentality of the State of Maryland\\" and had violated Hines' Fourteenth Amendment rights. The library appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, but it was dismissed. The library training course as subsequently opened to all applicants, but was later disbanded. During the case, Hines worked as a secretary for the Baltimore NAACP and a reporter for the Afro-American. She would ultimately work as a claims examiner for the Maryland Department of Human Resources, where she retired in 1978. Hines was later honored in 1986 at the centennial celebration of the library. She died of cancer on April 9, 2007 in Baltimore at the age of 91.

It was originally a home to house music, but later on got more of a hip hop feel. The club closed in the summer of 2016. The club was founded by Wayne Davis. He first started out DJing in 1976 at Odell's, another popular night club in Baltimore, until 1988. This is when he opened his own club call Fantasy that resided in a simple three story house. The Paradox started similarly in just an open building with a concrete floor. The building wasn't as important as the energy that it was filled with.  History The Paradox was seen as a place for the citizens of Baltimore to freely express their personalities and have a fun night out, the club was just as important for the people as it was for the producers. KW Griff described the club as a testing ground; if it didn't sound good at The Paradox then they knew they had to fix something. A major factor to the club's success was its focus on music, it's what club's owner Wayne Davis built the club around. Dj Oji Morris says \\"...it definitely has one of the best sound systems that I've ever played on outside of maybe Japan. So I don't know where else you will be able to go and experience the music like at Paradox.\\" The club marked important events in the careers of many notable Djs and Promoters in the Baltimore Club Music scene such as K-Swift, Scott Henry, Leroy Burgess Jr., Scottie B and Charles Feelgood. With the announcement of the club's closure many of Baltimore's citizens will see a large part of their lifetime fade away. After 25 years of dominating the Baltimore Club scene, the Paradox closed its doors permanently, following a social media announcement by club owner Wayne Davis in October 2015. This news came less than five years after a full renovation of the club, which aimed to draw larger crowds, and mirrored the recent closings of other notable Baltimore hotspots, including the locally famous Club Fantasy. Despite its apparent success and popularity within the community, the Paradox struggled to make a profit in its later years, particularly due to dwindling alcohol sales. Due to decreased revenue and a waning interest in the music most associated with the club, Wayne Davis was forced to it down and sell the property. The location which the Paradox occupied will be taken over by Hammerjack's, another long-standing hallmark of Baltimore's music scene—although notably less focused on the club music the city is known for. While the Paradox's closing marks the end of an era, the culture and musical genre which it cultivated over the years still thrives within similar bastions of Baltimore Club music like Club Choices, and in the sound of recent breakout artists such as Tate Kobang.

Located at 21 e.North Avenue, Odell's attracted adults aged 18–40 from all over the city. Odell's was very popular during its beginning, however its popularity was short lived, and in 1984, Odell Brock sold the club. The club would continue to be bought and sold by multiple other people, such as Philip A. Murray in 1985, and Milton Tillman Jr. in 1989. Only 16 years after its initial opening, Odell's Nightclub was officially shut down in 1992 due to complaints of noise and violence. After Brock's death in 1985, the nightclub's popularity started to drop as problems began to arise with the club's change in ownership. Odell's was well known for being the spot where many teenagers and young adults were able to let loose and be themselves. \\"Odell's was hugely popular and is still revered by some as the heart of house and dance music in Baltimore in the 1980s.\\" Being described by its regulars as a popular place for dance and music, seeing variety was not uncommon. \\"It was a culture and a lifestyle, and if you were a part of it then you felt like you were a part of something special. Not many clubs these days try to capture that emotional connection.\\" Odell's was first closed in 1987, following Murray's arrest for involvement in a heroin ring. The club re-opened under Tillman's ownership only to be shuttered again in 1992 following complaints of noise and violence surrounding the club. Tillman was later arrested on charges of bribery for attempting to sway the zoning board's position on the club. In August 1993, the corporate owner of Odell's nightclub applied for a permit to reopen Odell's as a restaurant and banquet hall with entertainment. The club was able to remain open briefly while the zoning issues worked their way through the courts, but was forced to close permanently at the end of August 1993. In 2012, Will Hanna entered into negotiations with the club's then owners to purchase the club with the intention of restoring it as an upscale nightclub.  Reception  Despite its short lifespan, Odell's received its share of positive and negative opinions. Residents who lived in a neighborhood near Odell's blamed the club for an outbreak of crimes such as car theft, shootings and street robberies. Owner (at the time) Milton Tillman attempted to remedy these complaints, saying, \\"A lot of the neighborhood's problems are blamed on us...

It is stationed at Baker Barracks, Thorney Island, West Sussex. The battery was originally formed as the first unit of the Bengal Artillery, raised in 1749 as part of the Honourable East India Company's Army. It was originally titled 1 Company, Bengal Artillery and was quartered in Fort William, Calcutta and was still garrisoned there when the fort was assaulted by the Nawab of Bengal. The majority of the battery subsequently died as prisoners of the Nawab in the now infamous Black Hole of Calcutta incident. Soon after the battery saw action in the Battle of Plassey as part of the force led by Sir Clive of India on 23 June 1757. It was the batteries heroic actions at this battle which later earned it the honour title 'Plassey'. On 19 February 1862 all the artillery of the East India Company was transferred to the Royal Artillery, and the battery became 1 Battery, 24 Brigade. In 1876 the battery moved to England and suffered an eclectic 6 years, re-roling and changing names many times. In 1882 it returned to what it knew and was posted to Burma, fighting in the Third Burma War. In 1889 it finally settled as 2 Mountain Battery, a title it would retain for the next fifty years. It finally became 9 (Plassey) Battery on 19 March 1947. History=Early history The capture of Madras by the French in 1746 brought home to the Honourable East Indian Company the error of omitting artillery from its regular forces. So on 17 June 1748, the Court of Directors of the Company authorised the formation of three artillery companies in Bengal, Bombay and Madras. These orders took some months to reach India and did not become effective until 1749. The first Bengal Artillery unit was raised in 1749. It was originally titled 1 Company, Bengal Artillery and was quartered in Fort William, Calcutta. The early records of the Battery were destroyed in the sacking of Calcutta in 1749, so the details are limited. However, it is known that the Battery was commanded by Capt Witherington and consisted of 5 other officers, 4 sergeant- bombardiers, 4 corporals, 100 gunners and 2 drummers. The company, much as like today, was double-hatted; as well as carrying out the normal artillery duties it also performed engineering and labouring tasks. Fort William was established to protect the Honourable East India Company's growing trade interests in Bengal. The fort had the provided protection from the French and was a base from which to colonise the remainder of Bengal. The Nawab of Bengal, Suraj Ud Doulah was unimpressed with the British military buildup and saw it as a direct threat to his rule in the province. He ordered an immediate halt to the fort's military enhancements; however, the Company did not heed his instruction and continued their enhancements. The stand off came to a head in June 1756 when he laid siege to the fort. The garrison commander organised an escape from the fort leaving behind a small military force to hold back the Nawab of Bengal's army, until reinforcements could arrive. The remaining force was commanded by John Zephaniah Howell and was quickly depleted by casualties and deserters. This resulted in the defence becoming untenable. On 20 June 1756 Fort William was in the hands of the Nawab. On capturing the fort the Nawab's Army took 146 prisoners. They were all housed in a 14 by 20 ft room which was later to become known as the ‘Black Hole of Calcutta.’ During the night 123 people died, including 45 members of our original Battery. The remnants of the Battery escaped to Fulta and joined a detachment of Madras Artillery commanded by Lieutenant William Jennings, part of the relief force of 230 Europeans led by Major Kilpatrick. Further reinforcements arrived at Fulta from Madras in December 1756 under the command of Sir Robert Clive. The Battery was equipped with 14 guns, most of which were 6-pounders. Under the command of the recently promoted Capt Jennings, they were involved in the battles against the Nawab's Army at Budge-Budge on 29 December and the capture of the Hoogli River on 10 January 1757. The Nawab then tried to counter-attack and assaulted Calcutta in February 1757, unfortunately for him, the attempt failed. Therefore, he was forced to make peace, but on terms advantageous to the Company. Battle of PlasseyFirst World War The battery fought during the first world war as 2nd Mountain Battery Royal Artillery spending most of the war fighting in the Salonika Campaign in the area of Lake Doiran. Post World War Two On arrival in Germany, 12th Regiment was converted to the anti-aircraft role as part of 6th Armoured Division and the battery was re-equipped with Bofors guns (initially with the L/60 variant, later L/70). It spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in Germany, though from 1963 to 1966 it was at Tampin, Malaya (at the time of the confrontation). From 25 November 1971 to 17 March 1972 it undertook the first of nine roulement tours to Northern Ireland (Operation Banner) in the infantry role, either with 12th Regiment or separately. A Rapier missile speeds towards its target during a live firing exercise. It moved to Rapier Barracks, Kirton-in-Lindsay in August 1972. From July 1973, 9 (Plassey) Battery of the regiment began trials with the Rapier anti-aircraft missile and by September 1975 the regiment was back in Germany fully equipped with the new system. It returned to Rapier Barracks in May 1981 and was there when the Falklands War broke out. 9 Battery was dispatched to the South Atlantic to take part in the conflict. It was back in Germany in January 1985, by now equipped with Tracked Rapier. From there, it deployed to the Gulf in January 1991 to take part in the Gulf War. It returned to England in 2009 and has been based at Baker Barracks, Thorney Island, West Sussex since then. Current status Stormer firing a Starstreak anti-aircraft missile.

Early life Janet Anne Galloway was born in Birdston, Stirlingshire, Scotland on 10 October 1841, the only surviving daughter in four children born to Alexander Galloway (1802–1883) a land surveyor and estate factor and his wife, Anne Bald. Janet moved with her family to Glasgow in 1844, where her father worked as a land agent, valuer, and accountant. Education Janet was initially educated in Britain, before being sent to schools in France, Germany, and Netherlands where she learnt to speak French and German fluently. She also developed an interest in history and archaeology and was taught bookkeeping and business methods by her father. Janet was known to be an accomplished pianist with an enduring love for music. Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women As a result of the limited educational opportunities open to women, Janet became an active supporter of the movement for higher education provision for women. In 1877 Janet was appointed as the honorary secretary of the new Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women, founded by Jessie Campbell and financed by Isabella Elder. John Caird, principal of Glasgow University at the time, was the first Chairman of its General Committee. Janet was responsible for recruiting teachers lecturers and examiners, and helped to develop and plan teaching methods and standards. Queen Margaret College Queen Margaret College, North Park House The Glasgow Association for the Higher Education of Women was incorporated into Queen Margaret College in 1833. The college opened in 1884 in North Park House, Glasgow, a merchants' mansion acquired by Isabella Elder and gifted to the college. Janet became the first secretary of the college, though she refused to accept any remuneration for her duties. Following her father's death in 1833, Janet moved into the college premises at North Park House. University of Glasgow Queen Margaret College became part of the University of Glasgow in 1892, following the Scottish Universities Commissioners ordinance to empower Scottish Universities to provide instruction for women and enable them to graduate. At this point Janet became an officer of the university, though she continued to decline payment for her services. Janet took a keen interest in the pastoral life of the university's female students; she organised social events and gatherings, encouraged the formation of societies and unions, and followed their careers after they graduated. In 1885 Janet was one of the founders of the Queen Margaret Guild an organisation that arranged talks for the university extension movement, and in 1894 she helped to found the student residence Queen Margaret Hall. She also helped to establish a women graduates association and was an active member of the executive committee of the Queen Margaret Settlement Association, which was part of the social reform settlement movement established in the 1880s. In 1893 Janet was personally invited to the Chicago Great Exhibition as a representative of Queen Margaret College. Janet was awarded an Honorary LLD by the University of Glasgow in 1907 in recognition of her lifelong dedication to the higher education of women Politics and Religion Janet was a political Conservative who opposed both women's suffrage and the employment of female lecturers. She initially believed that Queen Margaret College should educate women in their traditional roles, rather than equip them to enter men's professions. Although she was an advocate of single sex education she also campaigned throughout her life to open universities to women. Janet was baptized within the Church of Scotland but became a devoted member of the Scottish Episcopal Church, attending St Mary's Cathedral, Glasgow.Glasgow Herald, 25 & 27 January 1909. Death and Memorial Janet Galloway Memorial Window, Bute Hall, University of Glasgow Janet, who remained unmarried throughout her life, continued working right up to her unexpected death on 23 January 1909.

She dedicated her archaeological career to teaching and researching early farming cultures of Continental Europe. She became known for her survey of the TRB culture (Funnel(-neck-)beaker culture), the first farming culture of the North European Plain and southern Scandinavia, which was published by Edinburgh University Press.  Biography = Early life  Magdalena Stefania Midgley (née Kedzierska) was born in 1952 in Bydgoszcz, Poland. Daughter of Stefan Janusz Kedzierski, a Polish Air Force pilot, and Zofia Maria Appelt, she was brought up by her grandparents Bruno and Bronislawa Appelt. In 1972 she went to Scotland to visit relatives and develop her English language skills. There she met her future husband, Stephen Midgley, a teacher of modern languages. The couple married in May 1973.  Education  After completing her Scottish Highers at Stevenson College Midgley enrolled at the University of Edinburgh in 1974, where she studied Archaeology under Professor Stuart Piggott and was awarded an Honours Degree in Archaeology in 1978. . By this time she had developed a special interest in the Neolithic period, and in 1985 she completed her Doctoral Thesis on the earthen long barrows of northern Europe.  Academic career  In 1989 Midgley was appointed Lecturer in the University of Edinburgh's then-named Department of Prehistoric Archaeology. She was appointed as an Academic Advisor in Archaeology, and in 1992 contributed to organising the Certificate in Archaeology. From 1994 she directed the Centre for Continuing Education’s Summer School in Archaeology. Midgley was a leading figure in the development of the University of Edinburgh Access courses, providing mature-aged enrolments for undergraduate studies. She was also Quality Assurance Adviser to the Arts Faculty Group for several years in the mid-1990s. She was promoted to Senior Lecturer in 1997, and appointed Professor of the European Neolithic in 2013. Throughout her career, she participated in numerous excavations of prehistoric sites, beginning in her student days in the United Kingdom, and later leading projects spanning the Czech Republic, France, Scotland and Denmark. In her later years, before her final illness, she was working on two projects: firstly, a development of her earlier study of the TRB culture in the light of recent discoveries and theories; and secondly, a study of the early antiquarians, the emergence of the discipline of Archaeology and its relationship with, and influence on, the artists and writers of the Romantic movement.  Death  Midgley was diagnosed with cancer in 2013. She died at Kello Hospital, Biggar on 21 July 2014. In 2015 she was posthumously appointed Professor Emerita by the University of Edinburgh.

Before her death in 2013 at the age of 59, she was the Grierson Professor in English literature at the University of Edinburgh and the Director of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Humanities (IASH) at the University of Edinburgh. Prof. Manning's work on Scottish Enlightenment and transatlantic literature led to international acclaim. She was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Royal Society of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce, Edinburgh.  Education  Manning was born in Glasgow to Honora, a graduate of philosophy, and James Valentine, a physicist. When her family moved to Abingdon, Oxford in 1962 she attended Dunmore Primary where she met Jill Hanna. They became good friends and intellectual rivals, as Jill described in her tribute to Manning in 2013, \\"[W]e were rivals from the start, although the rivalry was simply a spur so that we both produced our individual best. Susan did not need a rival as she was always competing with herself\\". She later attended John Mason High School in Abingdon. She earned a BA degree from Newnham College, University of Cambridge, graduating in 1976. It was at Cambridge that she met her future husband, physicist Howard Manning and got married. She undertook doctoral studies at the University of Virginia under the supervision of Professor David Levin, a literary scholar and the Commonwealth Professor of English at the University of Virginia. She was equally attracted towards studying Scottish and American literature and the overlap between the two. Her main mode of inquiry involved discovering similarities between Scottish and American literary style, subjects and preoccupations, distinguishing these from English literature. This quest took the shape of defining what provincialism meant and its relation to any 'Centre'.Richard Goode (24-05-2013) Susan Manning: A Service of Appreciation and Thanksgiving.

Professional contribution  It took Manning 10 years to complete her PhD, during which time she was bringing up a young family. She would often joke that it had taken three children Laura, Lindsay and Sophie to complete her PhD. She took up a research fellowship in the Newnham College in 1981 where she went on to become a lecturer in 1984. Her interest in Scottish literature resulted in her first major publication, The Puritan-Provincial Vision: Scottish and American Literature in the Nineteenth Century, issued in 1990 by Cambridge University Press. In Cambridge, she created and taught the American literature course which became popular among students.

Brown was active in campaigning in New York for the passage of women's suffrage. Victory there on November 6, 1917 was an important step towards the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Following the passage of women suffrage in New York State in 1917, and pending passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, Brown wrote Your Vote and How to Use It. It was published in February 1918 by Harper & Brothers, and was endorsed by the New York State Women Suffrage Party.

Some of its materials were also used as the basis of a correspondence course for women voters, distributed by the New York State Women Suffrage Party. The book itself was listed as suggested civics reading for Girl Guides who wanted to earn a Citizen's Badge, in the 1920 guides handbook Scouting for Girls. In 1918, when the suffrage movement organized the Women's Overseas Hospitals in France, Gertrude Foster Brown became Director-General, serving in France.

She worked with her husband Karl Terzaghi on many engineering projects, as well as completed many papers and research projects of her own.  Early life  Ruth Allen Doggett was born in Chicago to Lewis and Grace Doggett. The Doggett family consisted of one brother and two sisters. Ruth and her siblings attended both public and private schools growing up. After graduating from high school, Ruth gained an interest in earth sciences, and attended the University of Chicago, finishing with a degree in both Geology and Earth sciences. Ruth graduated from the University of Chicago in 1924.  Education  At a young age, Ruth Allen Doggett attended both public and private schools when she lived in Chicago. When she grew up, she attended the University of Chicago and graduated in 1924 with a degree in geology and earth sciences. Ruth received an M.S. in geology at the university when she wrote a thesis on the Origin of Abnormally Steep Dips in the Niagaran reefs off the Chicago coastline. Between 1925 and 1928, she taught at both Goucher College and Wellesley College. While pursuing her doctorate, Ruth engaged in geological research of geology and petrology of the Columbian Falls region of Maine while attending Radcliffe College; it wasn't until 1930 that she received her Ph.D. in geology from Harvard. Geological achievements After writing her thesis on the Abnormal Dips in the Niagaran reefs near Chicago, Ruth spent many years from 1930 to 1938 travelling to different countries performing tests on soil and rock to determine how certain structures like bridges and dams should be built. Much of this work was done alongside her husband. She assisted him in his work by editing his papers and doing any additional research needed. During World War II Ruth began to develop an interest in the deterioration of cement. She was awarded the Clemens Herschel Prize for her paper on the similarity between the deterioration of concrete and the weathering of rock. This paper appeared in the Journal of the Boston Society of Civil Engineers in 1950. Later in 1950 Ruth's research led to her being assigned to determine the cause of the deterioration of concrete railway structures across the United States. Her experience in this field caught the attention of a bridge engineer Orwin Peck. Peck had been involved in the construction and design of a series of bridges with concrete components, which after 25 years began to deteriorate. Ruth made the suggestion that the current concrete beams be switched out for concrete beams with low alkali content. In 1948 she was awarded the first female position in the Geological Society of America for this idea. Her final scientific contribution and the paper she is most well known for \\"Sources of Error in Joint Surveys\\" Terzaghi R.D. (1965). Sources of Error in Joint Surveys. Geotechnique, 15(3) pp 287–304. is what earned her an honorary membership into the Association of Engineering Geologists. Her work was crucial in the early development of roadways and bridges as she was tasked with determining ways to combat the effects of deterioration in concrete. A task which she excelled at and which paved the way for the \\"modern\\" way of bridge building. Societal obstacles Being born a female in 1903 brought challenges to Ruth growing up. As both a woman and a scientist, Ruth was subjected to many obstacles on her path to becoming a renowned scientist. Before obtaining her doctorate degree, Ruth embarked on the career path of teaching geology, following a gendered societal role in the job market. Regardless of gendered roles within the working world, becoming a teacher of geology was a step forward in her scientific career as a geologist. After getting her doctorate, Ruth married her husband Karl Von Terzaghi. Despite her qualifications Ruth's efforts and work were overshadowed by the work of her husband. Ruth did not embark on her own individual research but instead became her husband's helpmate and provided him with services such as library research, editing his papers, and attending to her personal needs and teaching his classes. Being a woman in the field of science during the early twentieth century (and still today) put many obstacles in the way of getting research, ideas and credentials. Women during this time were put under the values of a patriarchal hegemony and were expected to be maternal figures in society and fulfill the roles of a mother and a wife. Breaking these patriarchal stereotypes made it hard for women in science to receive credit for their work and make breakthroughs in scientific fields. In 1936 she gave birth to her son Eric and went from helping Karl with his work to doing what women of the time were expected to do, taking care of their children. Ruth therefore lost a lot of free time, limiting the contributions she could make to science while Karl went on to continue his work. Living during the second World War was beneficial to Ruth. In 1938 Ruth and her son fled Vienna with Karl soon to follow. They moved to the United States where she later resumed her studies, focusing on concrete deterioration in slipways and roads. She used her experience to help the Association of American Railroads with expansive concrete problems. It is unknown how large of an impact Ruth could have had on American infrastructure if her work had not been limited by the roles she was put into. There are many more years of research that could have been done if she was not thrust into two very common roles for women of the time, assistant and a devoted mother. Ruth's attention to detail and her willingness to always produce the most scientifically sound results could have had a much greater impact if her expertise was applied in the western world earlier, perhaps stopping many disasters due to deterioration in concrete.  Later life  In 1928 she met her later to be husband, Karl Terzaghi, an Austrian civil engineer and geologist. Karl at the time of their meeting was a professor of civil engineering who is well recognized as the founder of soil mechanics (the scientific principles of engineering behaviour of earth matter). Ruth and Karl got married in 1930, beginning a close and lifelong partnership combining both their talents in engineering and geology. Upon their reuniting in France on June 7, 1930, after Ruth had finished her doctorate she became her husband's helpmate joining him for all of his field work, editing his papers, doing all of the necessary library research and taking care of his personal needs. Ruth gave birth on September 5, 1936, to her and Karl's first child, a son that they named Eric. In the summer of 1938 unknown to Karl, Ruth had arrived back in the United States. Ruth's husband Karl however was obliged to stay in Vienna as to not arise suspicion of his intent to flee the country. Word of Ruth's move back to the United States had come back to Vienna where others surmised that Ruth must have been Jewish and was leaving to flee the war, to which she was not. Five years after their first child, in May 1941 Ruth and Karl had a second child, a daughter they named Margaret. Ruth's responsibilities as a mother limited her ability to travel with her Husband and help him with his work in the field.  Historical context  Born in 1903, Ruth grew up to face different obstacles in society as a woman, scientist and citizen. As an adolescent and teenager Ruth attended both public and private schools allowing her to meet the requirements to study at the University of Chicago in the 1920s. Attending University in the 1920s was beneficial financially, as middle-class and working-class Americans experienced economic growth with the wages for workers being increased by 20% during this time period. Due to the growing wealth the middle and upper classes held, it made college affordable and accessible to those who met the requirements. The economic growth within the Twenties impacted the number of people attending colleges, more than doubling the class sizes. Due to this attendance increase, requirements to attend college became more competitive. Ruth met these competitive requirements and graduated from the University of Chicago in 1924 in geology and earth sciences. During the 1920s and most of the twentieth century colleges and scientific fields were seen to be male dominated sectors of society, by entering the field of science and obtaining college degrees Ruth broke this societal standard and began to pave a path for both herself in science and other women to follow this same path by going against predetermined biases of the hegemony. Teaching geology from 1925 to 1928 allowed Ruth to start a career for herself in the field of science. After beginning her career, she went back to school to receive her Ph.D. from Harvard in 1930. Ruth successfully obtained her Ph.D. before the economic crash in the 1930s. Marrying her husband Karl Terzaghi in 1930, the two left the United States during the Great Depression which allowed them to further their geological studies in different locations without the economic burden of the United States following them. Russia in regards to geology had taken a much greater interest in the history of geological knowledge than the United States, by travelling to Soviet Russia to investigate the geological conditions different projects including an arch dam. Ruth and her husband were given the benefit of being in a place that held higher importance of geological studies to both further their career and avoid the economic turmoil of the United States.

Eight other volcanic fields are also in the area. The field is within a basin that also contains three lakes. Volcanism in the field has produced lavas and cones, with rocks having varying compositions dominated by trachyandesite. Volcanism in the field may be influenced by faults in the area. The dates obtained from the field range from 5.0 ± 0.6 million years ago to 74,000 ± 4,000 years ago. An eruption of Ashi volcano was observed in 1951, making this one of China's youngest volcanoes.  Geological context  The Tibetan Plateau formed through the collision of India with Eurasia. -rich volcanic activity in the Tibetan Plateau has been occurring since 50 million years ago. After 8 million years ago, this volcanism occurred mainly in northwestern Tibet. It is not clear why volcanism occurs in the Tibetan plateau considering that the area is dominated by the collision between continents rather than subduction, which happens in other volcanically active areas. Southward subduction of the Asian Plate and the northward one of the Indian Plate have been found. Mélange from these subducting plates forms the source material of the magmas of the volcanic fields in northwestern Tibet, although isotope data suggest that the Ashikule magma may not derive from subduction. Magma generation in Ashikule could have been affected by garnet or garnet-containing crustal layers. More generally, the crust beneath northern and central Tibet is suspected to be partially molten between of depth. Rocks younger than 350,000 years have been found in the Tengchong system in the southeast and the Ashikule plateau in the northwestern part of Tibet. These are also the only volcanic systems with Holocene activity in Tibet. The volcanic areas of northwestern Tibet for the most part are situated at over altitude and are poorly accessible. The Ashikule volcanic field is one among nine in northwestern Tibet, other volcanic fields are Dahongliutan, Heishibei, Kangxiwa, Keriya, Pulu, Qitai Daban, Quanshuigou and Tianshuihai. Some of these volcanic centres are occasionally grouped with Ashikule in the Yutian- Yumen volcanic zone. A pronounced seismic velocity anomaly in southern Tarim may be associated with the volcanism at Ashikule, and a seismically imaged gap between the Tarim block and the Indian Plate below the crust may be a pathway for mantle upwelling that feeds the Ashikule volcanoes.  Geography  The Ashikule volcanic field is located in the Kunlun Shan, south of Yutian County, Xinjiang. It is one of the highest volcanic regions in the world and being remote and with a harsh climate, poorly researched. It occupies the southern parts of a large pull apart basin, the Ashikule Basin in the western Kunlun. This basin covers a surface area of at an altitude of , sloping southeastward. East-west stretching of the crust may play a role in volcanic activity there. The numerous strike slip faults in the area could be involved too, whereas subduction of the Tarim Basin beneath the Kunlun is unlikely. The Altyn Tagh fault crosses the field in east-northeast to south-southwest direction, and several other fault zones pass north of the basin; they are involved in the genesis of the Ashikule basin.  Geomorphology  There are 14 principal volcanoes in Ashikule, formed by lava, pumice and pyroclastics, with a total volume of about . Spatter cones and volcanoes of Quaternary age are in the Ashikule area, for a total amount of over 70 cones. Over 20 volcanoes have been found in the eastern part of the field, they reach heights of several . It features perfectly preserved cinder cones. Silicic lava domes are also found. The Ashikule basin is covered by - of lava from this field. Various kinds of rock coatings have developed on these lavas, some of biogenic origin. Xi Shan is the westernmost volcano with a diameter of and a height of With a summit height of and a height of above base, Dahei Shan volcano is the highest volcano at Ashikule and features a V-shaped crater. high Wuluke cone north of Wukule lake features a crater lake and has sent out many lava flows, some of which entered Wuluke lake. Migong Shan is east of Wuluke volcano. Yueya Shan has a high secondary cone within its wide crater; Maoniu Shan volcano is located nearby and they are surrounded by even smaller centres. Heilong Shan is a long volcanic ridge on the terraces of the Akesu River and to the east of it is the horseshoe-shaped Mati Shan and the high Dong Shan. Other volcanoes are known as Binhushan, Gaotaishan, Yinshan and Yizishan. The trachyandesitic Ashi volcano, also known as Ka-er-daxi or Vulkan, (,) is south of Ashikule lake in a lava plateau, at an altitude of . The wide cone features an uneroded high cone with a deep crater breached to the south. Lava flows from Ashi extend both north and south and cover a surface area of , reaching as far as lake Ashikule. There are three salt lakes in the area, Ashikule (also called Ashi or Aqqikkol), Shagesikule, and Wulukekule (also called Wuluke or Ulugkol). Ashi is long and Urukele . deep Ashikule covers a surface area of and formed when a valley was dammed by lava. Wulukekule and Ashikule are separated from each other by lava. Between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago Ashikule and Shagesikule were one lake. Playas of the same name are found in the area and are a source of mineral dust. The basin is in the area of the upper Keriya River.  Composition  The field is dominated by trachyandesite and trachydacite, ranging from tephrite over trachyandesite to trachyte and rhyolite. Ashi volcano has erupted trachyandesite. Phenocrysts in the rocks contain clinopyroxene, olivine, orthopyroxene and phlogopite. Xenoliths of gneiss are found in the rocks of Ashi volcano. Ashikule and Tengchong have high ratios of to in their composition. isotope data indicate that in comparison with the volcanoes of the Tengchong area, Ashikule volcanoes formed by slower melting of rocks. The magmas of Ashikule probably did not form under the influence of water metasomatism. The ultimate source rocks may be mafic- ultramafic rocks. The magma of Ashi volcano formed by the mixing of trachyandesitic magma with a more silicic component. The conditions in the magma chamber of Ashi volcano have been estimated. There are two populations of rocks, one formed at temperatures of at a depth of , the other at temperatures of at a depth of .  Climate  The Ashikule basin is one of the driest areas of Tibet. Discrepancies between dates obtained by surface exposure dating and potassium-argon dating on some rocks have been interpreted as being due to lava flows being covered by snow and ice in the past. From this it has been inferred that the Ashikule field was covered by glaciers during the Last Glacial Maximum, when temperatures decreased by .  Geochronology  Some ages are 5.0 ± 0.6 and 2.7 ± 1.8 million years ago and were obtained by argon-argon dating. Xi Shan volcano formed 2.8 million years ago. Mati Shan and a volcanic episode north of Ashikule occurred 1.63-1.21 million years ago. Most volcanoes formed 670,000 - 500,000 years ago, two other minor episodes occurred 440,000 - 280,000 and 200,000 - 120,000 years ago. Gaotaishan volcano is one million years and Binhushan volcano 370,000 years old. A burst of volcanic activity took place 270,000 years ago, forming several volcanoes, and Ashi and Wuluke cone erupted around 113,000 years ago. Most of the lava flows around Ashi were erupted 66,000 years ago. The latest eruption was on 27 May 1951, at Ashi volcano as was reported by the newspaper Xinjiang Daily. The report claimed that soldiers building a road heard roaring and saw a column of smoke, which continued for several days. A volcanic ash layer from this eruption has been found in the Changce Ice Cap, whereas the occurrence of lava flows at that time is unclear. Another unconfirmed report claims an eruption took place in the 19th century. Presently, the field is dormant. Fumarolic activity has been observed in the northern side of the crater of Ashi volcano. It is one of the few active volcanic regions in China. The magnitude 7.2 2008 Yutian earthquake took place south of the volcanic field, at the intersection of two major faults, the Karakax fault and the Altyn-Tagh fault. Other earthquakes occurred in 2012 and 2014. Volcanic activity may also be related to the Longmu-Gozha fault system.

Life = Childhood and adolescence  Francesco Orlando was born in Palermo to a wealthy family: his father, Camille Orlando, was a lawyer and the grandson of Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, President of the Italian Council. Following the onset of WWII, the Orlando family was forced to move to a country home near Terrasini, where Orlando began his studies. In 1943, following the American arrival in Sicily, his family returned to Palermo where the young Orlando attended Jesuit secondary school before ultimately studying at the public secondary school. These secondary-school years were formative for Orlando's intellectual development; he became interested in music, literature and theatre. In addition, Orlando's family environment was stimulating, they often hosted musical evenings in which the young Francesco was asked to perform on the piano and sing. Through his father's substantial library, he was able to explore a wide range of topics: indeed, at the age of 15, he published a translation of Victor Hugo's Hernani.  University training and career  After completing a degree in Law at the University of Palermo, Orlando followed in his father's footsteps and changed course by undertaking studies in Literature 1955. Through Baron Pietro Sgàdari di Lo Monaco, Orlando makes the acquaintance of the Prince and Sicilian writer Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa. He joined Tomasi's literary circle, where he received lessons in English, English Literature and French Literature. It was at this time that he is introduced to psychanalysis through his tutor's wife, Alexandra Wolff Stomersee, a student of Sigmund Freud. Following a meeting with Angelo Pizzorusso, a Professor at the University of Pisa who made note of his potential, Orlando became his student and specializes in French literature. His studies culminated in his first scholarly work, L'opera di Louis Ramond, dedicated to geologist, botanist and French explorer Louis Ramond de Carbonnières. In 1959, Orlando was awarded a scholarship to study in Paris, where he worked on a thesis titled Rotrou dalla tragicommedia alla tragedia', which constituted an important contribution to studies on French baroque theater. In 1967, he became professor of French literature in the Department of Literature and Foreign Languages at the University of Pisa. During the events of May 1968, he appeared in support of the student effort, yet remained in favor of academic activities continuing at their regular pace; he asked that disturbances to the academic calendar be limited. Following this time, around 1970, he petitioned for a transfer to the University of Naples Federico II, but maintained close collaboration with Pisa until his move to the Ca' Foscari University of Venice in 1975. In 1971, he published Lettura freudiana della \\"Phèdre\\", a course taught at the University of Pisa delineating the first volume of his Freudian cycle. The logical and formal rereading of the Freudian text, as a textual analysis tool applied to literature, and the confrontation with structural linguistics and semiotics garner him international recognition. He moved back to Pisa in 1982 and resumed his former position as Professor of Literature at the University of Pisa, where he became, in 1994, the first professor to teach a course on Literary Theory in Italy. In 1993, Giulio Einaudi editore published Gli oggetti desueti nelle immagini della letteratura, translated into English as \\"Obsolete objects in the literary imagination: ruins, relics, rarities, rubbish, uninhabited places, and hidden treasures\\" and published by the Yale University Press in 2006. Orlando retired from his university career in 2004, but pursues continued research in literature and published his first novel, titled La doppia seduzione. He died in Pisa in 2010.  Obsolete objects in the literary imagination: ruins, relics, rarities, rubbish, uninhabited places, and hidden treasures  Obsolete objects in the literary imagination: ruins, relics, rarities, rubbish, uninhabited places, and hidden treasures, text first published in Italian in 1993, is considered Francesco Orlando's magnum opus. Therein, he posits that the theoretical effort of defining literature is analogous to the passionate reading of texts in the Western tradition, from Antiquity to the 19th century. The theoretical crux of the books is faithful to the ambivalent orlandian view of time: time destroys or valorizes, but also destroys and valorizes. According to Orlando, this fundamental ambivalence is an anthropological constant for humankind, one that can be emphasized through literature, as this medium has the right to consider the representation of useless and disgusting objects, while also rejecting their esthetic value. The proliferation of this type of literary images, according to Orlando's perspective, testifies to a critique of existing expectations of order, efficiency and functionality typical of bourgeois society.

Tufail Abbas’s autobiography launched Airline industry union leader Abbas was a union leader at Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) during four decades. He had become an employee at Orient Airways in late 1948, and took part in the strike of March 1949. When PIA acquired Orient Airways, Abbas became a PIA employee. At the time PIA management and union leaders were in close contact, the PIA Managing-Director Malik Nur Khan sent Abbas to India to study labour practices at Air India. Abbas was jailed on different occasions due to his labour activism. In the Communist Party Abbas was recruited to the Communist Party of Pakistan in the early 1950s by Ahmed Aziz (who was later accused of having worked as a government infiltrator). At the time Abbas was working in the airline industry. By the late 1950s Abbas held the post of secretary of the Karachi Committee of the Communist Party. The Karachi Committee was hierarchically placed under the Hyderabad-based Sindh Provincial Committee, but under Abbas' leadership the Karachi Committee became increasingly independent. Apart from his base in the PIA union, Abbas also counted on support within the National Students Federation and some labour groups in the city. Sino-Soviet split In 1966 the Sindh Provincial Committee was split in pro-Soviet and pro-China parties, a split taking place in the aftermath of the 1965 Indo-Pakistan war. Abbas emerged as the general secretary of the underground, pro-Beijing Communist Party. His group won the support of the majority in the National Students Federation. Abbas was invited to the October 1 celebrations in China in 1966. After the 1966 split Abbas' faction began seeking to build an organization across West Pakistan. It also had some contacts in East Pakistan. Abbas' labour wing was known as the Quami Mazdoor Mahaz ('National Labour Front'), which emerged from the Markezi Mazdoor Committee in 1969. The Airways Employees Union was the strongest union inside the Quami Mazdoor Mahaz. Alliance with Bhutto Tacitly, the Abbas faction provided support to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. In the late 1960s, some member of the Abbas' faction joined Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party on the instruction of the party and began occupying positions in the PPP. Abbas' support base amongst students and workers played an important role in building the PPP in Karachi at its earliest phase.Workers Hammer.

It has been hypothesized that, among other aspects of their life, they functioned as religious specialists for Torres Strait Islanders, whose mastery of increase rituals attracted the native mariners from the north. Together with the Gudang, who apparently spoke the same language and whose territory ran from Cape York to Fly Point opposite Pabaju (Albany Island), the Unduyamo had strong cultural, kin and trade ties with the Kaurareg, the southwestern islanders centered around Muralag, with whom they enjoyed an alliance that permitted reciprocal residence on each other's territory. All three groups regarded the Yadhaigana and Gumakudin as hostile. Archaeology has uncovered a dense network of ritual sites consisting of stone rings and turtle mounds in various forms located on rocky headlands jutting forth towards Torres Strait which are thought to have functioned as sentinels or 'approach points' for travellers from the north, in the areas associated with the Gudang ande Unduyamo peoples. According to Greer, McIntyre-Tamwoy and Henry these stoneworks were raised by ritual specialists among these northern Cape tribes for ceremonial purposes associated with initiation rites and increase magic, for example to ensure the reproduction of maritime species prized by hunters, such as the dugong.

Symptoms can range from mild to severe depending on the species, number and location of trematodes in the infected organism. Symptoms depend on type of trematode present, and include chest and abdominal pain, high temperature, digestion issues, cough and shortness of breath, diarrhoea and change in appetite. Trematodiases can be transmitted through food or water that contains larval forms of the parasite. Infections can be transmitted through aquatic organisms which act as a host for the maturity of the parasite. Foodborne trematodiases is transmitted when organisms ingest contaminated undercooked food including aquatic plants and organisms. Trematodiases can be prevented and controlled through public health programs aimed to educate people about how contaminated water and food can lead to infections. Education programs include raising awareness about the transmission of trematodiases through the consumption of food that is not cooked well such as fish, molluscs, and other aquatic animals and plants. Sanitation and distribution of clean water is also used to control the spread of trematodiases on a larger scale. Foodborne trematodiases that infect the lung, liver and intestines are classified as a neglected tropical disease. Cases of trematodiases that can be transmitted through food has affected over 70 countries globally, with the most impacted countries located in Latin America and Asia. In 2018, the World Health Organisation declared that there are approximately 200,000 cases of trematodiases that are caused by four species of trematodes. The majority of cases of foodborne trematodiases are from East and Southeast Asia.  Signs and symptoms  Most cases of trematodiases show no symptoms. Infected organisms that show symptoms will range in severity depending on number of parasites. When the number of trematodes are high, signs of infection include severe pain in the abdomen. The signs and symptoms of the disease is also impacted by the location and spread of the parasite in the body. Tissues in organs are damaged when infected by the parasite. This damage can be mechanical as the parasite attaches to the walls of the host, as well as chemical. Symptoms of lung fluke infections (Paragonimus) depend on the parasite’s stage in its life cycle, and how it travels around in the lung. Trematodiases that impacts the lungs can cause cough, headache, chest pain, high temperature and change in appetite. Intestinal trematodiases infect the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms of intestinal fluke infections can range from mild to severe symptoms depending on the length of time that the parasite spends in the body. Signs and symptoms that arise in infected organisms include headache, indigestion problems such as diarrhoea, high temperature and pain in the abdomen which can also lead to malnutrition as the infected organism’s appetite is lost. In intestinal trematodiases, the walls of the intestine can be damaged, which can lead to ulcers in some infected organisms. Trematodiases caused by liver trematodes infect the host’s liver, gall bladder and bile duct and can cause inflammation within these organs. Symptoms vary from case to case and include abdominal pain, loss of appetite, problems with indigestion including diarrhoea and constipation, whereas in some cases, no symptoms are shown. O. viverrini damages the bile duct when in the adult stage of the life cycle, forming the cancer cholangiocarcinoma. Blood flukes can cause the trematodiases Schistosomiasis which can cause reactions on skin. When infected, the host can also experience symptoms such as nausea, lack of appetite, diarrhoea and abdominal pain.  Causes  Trematodiases are zoonotic infections caused by trematodes. In foodborne trematodiases, these parasites are transferred from animals to humans. Transmission of trematodiases can occur through the consumption of water and food that is contaminated with trematodes in the larval stages of their life cycle. In a host organism, eggs of trematodes can spread through faeces, and sputum if the host is infected by a lung fluke. Once these reach water, they infect aquatic snails which act as intermediate hosts for trematodiases that is transmitted through food. A second host will depend on the species of trematode, and are usually aquatic animals Some trematodiases such as Schistosomiasis can also be transmitted when skin comes in contact with water containing the parasite.Trematodes all have different life cycles in which they can reproduce asexually and sexually. When trematodes are at the metacercariae stage in their life cycle, humans and other definitive hosts such as mammals and birds can be infected. In humans, adult trematodes can survive for 25 years. Fasciola hepatica, a species of trematode that causes trematodiases, and infects the liver  Types of trematodiases  There are different types of trematodiases depending on the species of trematode that has infected the organism as well as their location in humans. There are over 80 different species of trematodes that are transmitted through food that can cause infections in humans. Foodborne trematodiases include intestinal flukes, lung flukes and liver flukes. Liver flukes cause liver disease in humans and are caused by the species Clonorchis, Opisthorchis and Fasciola. Intestinal flukes infect the gastrointestinal tract and can be caused by the species F. buski, Echinostoma, Metagonimus, Heterophyes, Gastrodiscoides. Lung flukes, mainly the genus, Paragonimus, infect the lungs of organisms, causing infections that can last for up to 20 years in humans. Foodborne trematodiases include Clonorchiasis, Opisthorchiasis, Fascioliasis and Paragonimiasis.  Diagnosis  Trematodiases can be diagnosed through a variety of methods. One of these is known as parasitological diagnosis, which relies on lab tests that detect the presence of trematode eggs where samples are taken from faeces or sputum. Techniques used to measure the number of eggs in samples taken from infected organisms include FLOTAC, Kato-Katz, formalin-ethyl-acetate. Different techniques have a different degree in which they can accurately detect eggs of trematodes, and some of these may not be able to detect low amounts. Using a variety of these techniques on different samples can strengthen the accuracy of this method. Another method in which trematodiases can be diagnosed is through antibodies that are produced by the host’s immune response when infected. This is known as immunodiagnosis. These antibody tests can be highly specific, or not specific at all, depending on the technique used. Molecular diagnosis is also used to detect trematodiases. This is specific as it uses the methods of polymerase chain reactions, pyrosequencing and other techniques to detect the parasite’s DNA in samples. It is suitable for detecting infections regardless of their number. Radiological examinations use imaging such as CT scans, X-rays and ultrasounds to detect certain species of the parasite. For liver fluke infections, ultrasounds are commonly used to search for evidence of the infection in the body. It is not very specific in diagnosing the exact trematode which has infected the organism.  Prevention  Species of trematodes that can cause trematodiases Prevention strategies aim to reduce the number of cases of trematodiases globally and lower infection rates, alongside stopping reinfection of individuals who have been infected before. Public health programs are necessary prevention strategies that aim to raise awareness about the transmission and cause of trematodiases. Food safety and hygiene practices are also implemented to reduce transmission of the parasites through food and water. Most trematodiases is transmitted through eating raw aquatic plants and animals such as fish, crustaceans, crabs, watercress, frogs and snails. Health education programs aim to outline how transmission of disease can be prevented by raising awareness of food safety practices. This includes spreading information about the importance of heating food in eliminating the chance of contracting trematodiases, as well as the importance of cleaning utensils, cutting boards and other equipment to prevent cross-contamination. These education programs are also used to raise awareness to retailers in order to prevent consumers from infections. The Food and Drug Administration recommends that fish which will be consumed undercooked should be placed in low temperatures and frozen under -20 degrees Celsius for at least a week, or under -35 degrees Celsius for a minimum of 15 hours, as freezing removes any chance of transmitting parasites to consumers. Using data from previous years can also be used to create mathematical models that allow for predictions of how the disease is transmitted, and where it can be effectively intervened in order to stop the increase in cases. Improving access to clean water is another method used to prevent the transmission of trematodiases through water. Water sanitation and treatment of sewerage is used to prevent the continuation of the cycle of infections. There is no vaccine for foodborne trematodiases that can be used to prevent infections. The World Health Organisation has implemented various methods to control the rates of infection by mapping data in endemic areas and reviewing implemented activities by monitoring infection and incidence rates.  Treatment  Chemical structure of Paraziquantel, a chemotherapy drug used to treat most forms of trematodiases. Treatment varies depending on the number of cases in an area. Chemotherapy drugs praziquantel and triclabendazole can be used in different amounts depending on the type of trematode infecting the organism, and its location in the body. In 2016, 600000 cases globally received treatment for foodborne trematodiases. Praziquantel can act on a broad range of trematodes by disrupting the homeostasis of calcium ions, and is used to treat liver, intestinal and lung fluke infections. It was introduced as a treatment option in 1975 and targets various trematodiases by impacting the trematode’s ability to move in the host. Adverse reactions to this treatment that may occur are mild, and include headache, abdominal pain and dizziness. Although it is very effective and safe in treating most trematodiases, praziquantel can cause hypersensitivity or allergic reactions in rare cases. It also cannot be used to treat the trematodiases fascioliasis. Triclabendazole is a narrow-spectrum treatment of trematodiases and is commonly used to treat fascioliasis. This anthelminthic is effective against the species Fasciola and Paragonimus. Although it was used in domestic livestock from 1983, the treatment was approved for use in humans in 1997 in Egypt. In 2019, it was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating cases of human infections. Common adverse reactions to triclabendazole include dizziness, sweating, pain in abdomen, headaches and biliary colic, which is mainly caused by the removal of dead trematodes from the body’s hepatobiliary system. Preventive chemotherapy is a strategy used in areas where the number of cases and infection rates are very high, as all individuals in the given area are treated with medicine for trematodiases. This is used as an option to prevent further spread of the infection. For clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis, when the incidence of cases exceeds 20%, all individuals are treated every year.  Epidemiology  Trematodiases that infects the lung, liver and intestine are classified as neglected tropical diseases by the World Health Organisation. Neglected tropical diseases are made up of bacterial, parasitic and viral infections that negatively impact the development of children, pregnancy and economic outcomes of developing countries. Changes in population numbers, food distribution channels, poverty and health education programs contribute to the fluctuating epidemiological patterns. Social, ecological and economical factors also change distribution patterns globally. Factors such as rainfall, pollution, climate, vegetation, water temperature and quality change the interactions between trematodes and their hosts. The expansion of aquaculture production and irrigation systems has also changed the spread of the disease. In areas where water is not sufficiently sanitised, infection rates have increased. The World Health Organisation declares that there are approximately 200000 cases per year, leading to over 7000 deaths. The highest number of foodborne trematodiases cases and the highest disease burden was recorded in East and Southeast Asia in 2019. In northeast Thailand, O. viverrini which is carcinogenic is present in high numbers, where over 20000 lives are lost a year due to cholangiocarcinoma caused by the trematode. Clonorchis sinesis, a species which causes trematodiases that infects the liver Clonorchis sinensis and Opisthorchis viverrini are two species which can cause trematodiases that infects the liver. These are more prevalent in males than females, and more common in adults than children. F. hepatica, a species of liver flukes, have a higher incidence rate in children and females, with a higher number of cases of lung fluke and intestinal trematodiases in children. Cases of liver and lung fluke trematodiases are high in numbers due to the amount of time the trematode can live in host organisms and increased chances of reinfection. Increase in travel and increase in popularity of traditional dishes such as raw oysters, crab meat, pickled seafood and other undercooked aquatic plants has also contributed to the rise in cases of trematodiases. The Global Burden of Disease Study carried out in 2016 estimated that approximately 75 million people were impacted by trematodiases and that there were around 2 million disability-adjusted life years that were affected and lost to the disease, due to damage that was caused by the infection.

With an estimated death toll of 4,386 people and only 24 survivors, it was the deadliest peacetime maritime disaster in history. Doña Paz was traveling from Leyte island to the Philippine capital of Manila. The vessel was seriously overcrowded, with at least 2000 passengers not listed on the manifest. In addition, it was claimed that the ship carried no radio and that the life-jackets were locked away. But official blame was directed at the MT Vector, which was found to be unseaworthy and operating without a license, lookout or qualified master. = Collision = At the time of its sinking, the Doña Paz was sailing the route of Manila → Tacloban → Catbalogan → Manila and vice versa, making trips twice a week.[4][5] On December 20, 1987, at 06:30, Philippine Standard Time, the Doña Paz left from Tacloban City, Leyte, for the City of Manila,[4][6] with a stopover at Catbalogan City, Samar.[7] The vessel was due in Manila at 04:00 the following day, and it was reported that it last made radio contact at around 20:00.[6] However, subsequent reports indicated that the Doña Paz had no radio.[8][9] At around 22:30, Philippine Standard Time, the ferry was situated at Dumali Point along the Tablas Strait, near Marinduque.[6] A survivor later said that the weather at sea that night was clear, but the sea was choppy.[7] While most of the passengers slept, the Doña Paz collided with MT Vector, an oil tanker en route from Bataan to Masbate. The Vector was carrying 8,800 US barrels (1,050,000 l; 280,000 US gal; 230,000 imp gal) of gasoline and other petroleum products owned by Caltex Philippines.[4] Upon collision, the Vector's cargo ignited and caused a fire on the ship that spread onto the Doña Paz. Survivors recalled sensing the crash and an explosion, causing panic on the vessel.[6] One of them, a passenger named Paquito Osabel, recounted that the flames spread rapidly throughout the ship and that the sea all around the ship itself was on fire.[6][7] Another survivor claimed that the lights onboard had gone out minutes after the collision, that there were no life vests to be found on the Doña Paz, and that all of the crewmen were running around in panic with the other passengers and that none of the crew gave any orders nor made any attempt to organize the passengers.[7] It was later said that the life jacket lockers had been locked.[9] The survivors were forced to jump off the ship and swim among charred bodies in flaming waters around the ship.[10] The Doña Paz sank within two hours of the collision, while the Vector sank within four hours.[9] Both ships sank in about 545 meters (1,788 ft) of water in the shark-infested Tablas Strait.[11] It reportedly took eight hours before Philippine maritime authorities learned of the accident, and another eight hours to organize search-and-rescue operations.[9]  MV Doña Marilyn (October 1988)  In the afternoon of October 24, 1988, while sailing from Manila to Tacloban City, the vessel was caught up in Typhoon Unsang and sank,[1] leaving 389 dead, with only 147 survivors.  MV Princess of the Orient (September 1998)  September 18, 1998, the 13,935-ton, 195.1-metre (640 ft) long Princess of the Orient, sailed from Manila to Cebu during a typhoon. The ship capsized at 12:55 p.m. near Fortune Island in Batangas and sank, and out of the 388 passengers on board, 150 were killed. Passengers were floating at sea for more than 12 hours before rescuers were able to reach the survivors.[1] = Wreckage = The wreck is resting on her port side at 122 meters (400 ft) below sea level just outside Manila Bay.[2] In the early 2000s, John Bennett and Ron Loos made the first scuba divesto the wreck site.[2][3] Due to the position of the wreck, the actual cause of the sinking may not be discovered.[3]  MV Princess of the Stars (June 2008)  An inflatable boat from the Maritime Prepositioning Ship USNS GYSGT Fred W.

Go added that the removal process of the chemicals would take 30 days in 4 stages, and before that there will be an initial mobilization period that could last two to three weeks. \\"As we committed to the DOTC and Congress, we are proceeding with the priority removal of Del Monte and Bayer's misdeclared cargo without quibbling about the legalities.

The BMI recommended that Marina “consider the suspension of the Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) of Sulpicio Lines in accordance with existing laws, rules and regulations (and its criminal liability for the sinking.\\" The final report blamed human error, and ruled that the ship's missing and presumed dead captain, Florencio Marimon, \\"miscalculated\\" the risk of continuing the trip to Cebu while the storm raged: \\"There was a failure of the master to exercise extraordinary diligence and good seamanship thereby committing an error of judgment.The immediate cause of the capsizing of MV Princess of the Stars was the failure of the Master to exercise extraordinary diligence and good seamanship thereby committing an error of judgment that brought MV Princess of the Stars in harm's way into the eye of typhoon Frank or Typhoon Fengshen (2008).

Legal controversies  Despite figuring in three major maritime disasters in the span of 11 years (from 1987 to 1998) resulting in the deaths of more than 4,500 people, the company was never held liable by the Philippine courts. PSACC has been accused of heavily overloading its ships, such as on MV Doña Paz when only 1,500 people appeared in the ship's manifest out of the 4,500 passengers and crew.

Facts American Telephone & Telegraph Co. loaned 1.5 million dollars to the Democratic National Committee in the lead-up to the 1968 election and then did not seek to collect the loan. Certain shareholders sued for waste. Reasoning Although the business judgment rule protects corporate board's decisions from second guessing by shareholders or the courts, in this case, the board's decision to \\"loan\\" money to the Democratic National Committee was an illegal campaign contribution, in violation of the Tillman Act. The courts found that the decision not to collect on the loan was a knowing decision of the board's, and that it also constituted an illegal campaign contribution.

History Remains of the murals in the Palace of the Jaguars The existing structures were built around 450 to 500 AD. These buildings were built over earlier structures from around 250 to 300 AD. Due to the location of the palace and the quality of its art, it is thought the complex was home to a high ranking priest or other dignitary. The complex may have also been used for ceremonial purposes. The name Quetzalpapálotl comes from the reliefs of mythological birds on the courtyard pillars and is from Nahuatl quetzalli, precious feather, and pāpālōtl, butterfly.

History= Renaissance precursors  During the European Renaissance, many engravers and printers revolved to typography to solve the problem of small lettering on maps, which was very difficult to reproduce solely by using custom engraved lettering. One of the techniques they relied on was the setting of metal type, which was fitted inside a special form, surrounded by spacing material. Words set that way could then be overprinted over woodcut-printed maps as a separate plate, either in black or coloured ink. This technique has been considered a precursor of the typometric technique of the 18th century.  18th century inventors  In the 18th century, the German deacon August Gottlieb Preuschen (1734–1803), from Karlsruhe, published two books on the art of printing maps using movable type. The books were printed in Basel, Switzerland, using type from the foundry Haas'sche Schriftgiesserei, by Wilhelm Haas-Münch (1741–1800). Wilhelm Haas- Münch has been quoted as the inventor of typometry in 1776, in competition with Johann Gottlob Breitkopf of Leipzig. The name typometrie was proposed by August Gottlieb Preuschen himself, the former name of the method being ingénieurie d'estampes (sic.) (engraving's engineering, in French in the original). After some rudimentary tests by Preuschen, the 1776 map of the Canton of Basel (in cuarto format) was the first map created by this technique. Some others would follow, such as the 1777 map of Sicily, which features toponyms printed with moveable type as well as roads, coasts, divisions and rivers printed with folding metal filaments. Special moveable topographic symbols mark the mountain ranges of the island, its fortifications, and other landmarks. The printer Johann Gottlob Immanuel Breitkopf, based in Leipzig (Germany) was at first critical with the invention, claiming that it was impossible to accurately adapt and assemble different shapes of types to create a new form. But, after the typometric prints were proven to be successful, he began experimenting himself with the technique, and he printed a map of the whereabouts of Leipzig by using it.  19th century researchers  Kaiser Ferdinand by Franz Raffelsperger, printed with movable type In the early 19th century, two different issues of a French review called the Bulletin de la Société d’Encouragement pour l’Industrie Nationale contains articles about typometry. The first one, of 1808, refers to the research work of Mr. Periaux and Mr. Poterat, to produce typometric maps, in order to generate a viable alternative to engraved maps. The second article, of 1825, introduces the advancements made by Firmin Didot, son, in the technique of printing maps by using typographic means. The polychrome maps of France made by Didot were sold at the price of 1 franc and 50 cents, which was more affordable than the monochrome engraved maps of the time. Typometric maps, even with their inferior detail quality, were also considerably faster to produce than engraved maps. After Didot, and util 1832, printers Wegener the Young in Berlin and Georg Michael Bauerkeller (1805-1886) in Frankfurt am Main did some essays with the technique for producing maps, but without attaining much success. It was not until 1839 in Vienna that Slovak cartographer Franz Raffelsperger (1793-1861), having prefected his own printing methods without knowing the work of his predecessors, produced a typometric postal card of the Austrian Empire of unprecedented quality. This postal card was rewarded with the golden medal at the industrial exhibition that took place that year in Vienna, and the next year he opened his own typometric press in that city. Raffelsperger produced moveable type characters that allowed him to print every possible feature in a map, including geographic and topographic features, mathematical and geometric symbols, architectural landmarks and even plants and animals. He also designed custom symbols for cities, forests and other elements, that he printed in five different text sizes and in several languages. He then combined these this typometric technique with polychromy, so he could print moveable type characters for each geographical feature of the map with their very own precise colour hue. The different available sizes of his printing components allowed him to print his maps in several sizes without losing quality, and that at a very reduced cost. After Raffelsperger, other European printers continued to experiment with typometry, and several examples were presented at the 1855 International Exhibition in Paris.See, on that issue, , where typometry is referred to as travail en filets typographiques (work with typographic threads in French). However, with the advent of lithography, invented by Alois Senefelder in 1796, typometry was confronted with another method that was even better at reproducing detail and that allowed to print several solid colours at a low price, so it was progressively abandoned.

The original monument  History of construction  Catherine the Great by her rescript in 1794 launched the beginning of construction of Odessa city and its port. In gratitude for this Odessites in 1900 erected a monument to Catherine and her companions, who played an important role in the formation of young Odessa. Opening of the monument took place on May 6, 1900, in the eponymous square in the city center. Opening of the monument to Catherine the Great in Odessa The prospect of building a Monument to the Founders of the city was offered as early as 1890 at a meeting of the City council on the subject of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Odessa. On September 23, 1891 the Odessa City Council decided to establish a monument projects contest with two awards (two and one thousand rubles) for the best work. By May 1, 1892 the first prize was awarded to the project under the slogan \\"Odessa port\\" by Odessa architect Y.M.Dmitrenko, the second - under the slogan \\"Esperance\\" by foreign architect Donato Barkalaja. January 14, 1893, after the report by the Minister of Internal Affairs to the Emperor, Imperial permission followed to erect a monument to the Founders of the city to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Odessa. The estimates of the project amounted to 57 thousands rubles. Models of monument sculpture was manufactured by the professor, Imperial Academy of Arts (St. Petersburg) academician M.P.Popov, and works on building the foundations of a pedestal and casting of bronze figures themselves were commissioned to the sculptor B.V.Eduards and to the foreman of overall craft council of marble shop in Odessa Leopold Mentsione.Губарь О.

Opening of the Monument to the Founders was accompanied by solemn ceremonies and citywide celebration, culminating in a fireworks.  History of destruction  Three years after the October Revolution, in 1920, the monument was dismantled, under the dominant ideology of struggle against heritage the Czarist regime. Statues of Empress companions have been stored in the Odessa Museum of Regional History, and the figure of Empress herself was partially destroyed. In 1965, on the 60th anniversary of the uprising at the battleship \\"Potemkin\\" a monument to its sailors was built in this place. The monument in the 1920s  History of reconstruction of the monument  First time the idea to restore the Catherine monument appeared in the late 1980s-early 1990s. Some fund-raising were organized. However, this ended with nothing. The first serious interest in his recovery took shape in 1995, when the Odessa City Council decided to restore the monument to the Founders of the city, at the same time using the preserved bronze fragments and adding the missing elements of the granite pedestal. However, these plans were stopped by the President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma. On July 2, 2007 for consideration of the Odessa City Council a draft decision named \\"On the complex restoration and improvement of Ekaterininskaya Square of Odessa city with reproduction of its historical type\\" was submitted. According to this decision, the monument to the sailors of the battleship \\"Potemkin\\" should be moved to the Customs Square, while the original monument should be reconstructed on Ekateriniskaya Square. By this decision of the City Council (#1401-V from 04.07.2007) a special commission was established to monitor the compliance of the restored monument with the lost original. The project sponsor and the customer of restoration works was City Council deputy Ruslan S. Tarpan. Ruslan Tarpan: \\"The desire to restore Ekaterininskaya Square in all its beauty, visible on old postcards, appeared in my youth, that's why I acted as a customer and sponsor of the restoration of this monument. It was thorny, but exciting way for me. It was a matter of honor for me to restore it in that form in which it was at the beginning of the twentieth century, when in 1901 at the World exhibition in Paris, this Square was named as the best in Europe! \\" Honored architect of Ukraine Professor Vladimir Glazyrin was named as inspector general for all planned works. Many preserved historical documents and photographs of those times were widely used during the reconstruction. Such as a watercolor sketch of the architect Yuri Dmitrenko \\"Odessa-port\\" project which won in 1892 competition. It was decided to reproduce everything like it was when the monument was opened a century ago, therefore the monument differs from the conceptual design of Dmitrenko. The only external difference from the original monument became four bronze plaques with the names of the Companions of Catherine. The bronze figure of the Empress was made completely newly, because it seemed impossible to combine in color the head preserved in the museum with the rest of the created figure. According to the decision of Ruslan Tarpan, the customer of the reconstruction, a tender was announced for the casting of the Catherine bronze statue. It was won by the \\"Artist\\" plant from Kiev, which was already known in Odessa when it cast monuments to other famous Odessa people like singer Leonid Utyosov, aviator Sergei Utochkin , actress Vera Holodnaya, and others. Sculpting figures and decoration were carried out by Oleg Chernoivanov and Honored artist of Ukraine Nikolay Oleynik, both also from Kiev. Work on the production of 3-meter sculpture was performed in a few months. The figures of the four companions of Catherine, - Potemkin, Zubov, de Ribas and de Wollant, were used after the necessary restoration in their original. these figures have been saved thanks to such significant artist as Maxim Gorky and Benois Original figures of the Monument to the founder of Odessa in the courtyard of the Local histort museum. Especially careful was approach in search of granite samples needed to make the pedestal. Thus, the column was made of red granite, mined in the Yemelyanovsky career (also known as \\"Zhytomyr granite\\"), for the pedestal – from the Yantsevskoye deposit, for staircases - from Novokonstantinovskoye granit deposit in Ukraine. On 19th July 2007 a grand laying of the symbolic stone at the site of the restored monument was held. Ruslan Tarpan: - \\"As in the old Odessa and the same today: in the basis for building foundation was laid a capsule or a granite plate. Similarly, today, in the presence of priests, we made a solemn bookmark of this monument.\\" Restoration of the monument required putting in order the entire area around the monument. Within six months the project documentation was created, archive materials were studied to restore the original appearance and colors of buildings. \\"Incor Group\\" company conducted a full restoration of Ekateriniskaya Square . 6000 elements of the stucco decorations on the buildings was recreated as well as cast-iron elements like lattice balconies, gates, which are facing the square. Now the ensemble of buildings on the Square looks the same as it looked a hundred years ago, in a sense of color and architecte. An atmosphere of rest was created around the monument - the green lawn with flowers planted in a shape of Catherine II monogram, neat benches and streetlights, typical for the beginning of the 20th century. In the same style was installed a plaque describing the history of the monument and its restoration. The square itself was paved with granite tiles. In addition, all of the buildings and monuments were specifically lightened, allowing to enjoy the architecture in the dark. An\\"intelligent\\" system of architectural lighting was applied, allowing, among other things, to save electricity. The security system, which includes a number of video cameras that allowed to view the entire square, was set there. Monument to Odessa founders 2010  The opening ceremony of the reconstructed monument  On October 27, 2007 a large number of citizens of Odessa gathered at the opening of the monument. Invitation ticket for the opening of the monument to the Founder of Odessa The solemn ceremony was made looking back to the similar of 1900: girls, uniformed as soldiers of Preobrazhensky Life Guards Regiment encircled the monument, and the ladies and gentlemen dressed in costumes of the era of the “golden age” of Catherine were walking around. The monument to the Founders of Odessa before its opening The monument was covered with a gold cloth. The opening was accompanied by fireworks and salute. After the ceremony the Odessa Philharmonic orchestra played under Hobart Earle (USA) It should be also mentioned the numerous attempts to counteract the installation of the monument in Odessa - from the highest authorities - such disparaging statement then-President Viktor Yushchenko – up to representatives of Ukrainian nationalist parties and movements arrived to the city especially to disrupt the opening of the monument. For security reasons Ekaterininskaya Square was surrounded by the police cordon that separated supporters and opponents of the ceremony. After the monument was unveiled, opponents of this action retreated. However, since the opening and till now it is guarded day and night by law enforcers. After the opening of the Monument to the Founders of Odessa Ekaterininskaya Square complex has become one of the main attractions of the city.

Since 2015, the NT2 has been collaborating with the Canada Research Chair in Digital Art and Literature. Background and philosophy The NT2 is both a physical space (a research laboratory at UQAM), and a virtual space (the NT2 website, a hub for hypermedia literature and art). Their mission is to promote the study, understanding, creation, and archiving of new forms of hypermedia literature and art. Its main focus is the assessment and promotion of new expressions of cyberculture, as well as the development of novel strategies for ongoing research relating to new forms of art or text. As such, the NT2 pursues three overarching research objectives: 1:To develop novel research methodologies in the arts and literature 2:To bear witness to the manifestations of cyberculture 3: To promote the research activities of the research community, Figura (Research Center on Texts and the Imaginary) and its Observatory of the Contemporary Imaginary (OIC). Their main interests are hypermedia art (often known as Internet Art or net.art), new media and e-literature. The archiving of these relatively new forms, thus allowing for long-term study, is central in the NT2’s range of activities. Through ongoing projects and collaborations, the NT2 focuses on promoting a community of interest and a network of researchers. This revolves around the study of contemporary imaginaries, and the exploration of novel research methodologies, adapted to contemporary contexts and technologies. Hypermedia Art and Literature (HAL) Directory The NT2’s main project has been the creation of the Hypermedia Art and Literature (HAL) Directory, which began in 2006. An index and showcase of hypermedia works, the database was created in response to the inadequacy of established tools of description for literature, cinema and art, as well as the lack of a substantial repertory for the institutionalisation and collection of these new works. The Directory was created using the open source content management system, Drupal. It is populated by hypertext and hypermedia literary and art works, with a particular emphasis on French language works. For each piece, an entry presents bibliographic information and a description of the work or site, including a classification based on the nature of the piece, its type of interactivity, and its general format. Certain cases also include research or technical notes and navigation screenshots. The HAL Directory lists works that have mainly been presented on the internet, as well as some available on CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, and, for older pieces, on diskette. In October 2015, the Directory included over 4,100 works, ranging from some closer to literature and others incorporating cinematographic, artistic and theatrical expression as well as animation, cartooning, graffiti, and video games. According to an article written by Bertrand Gervais in 2009, three main challenges that arose whilst developing the HAL Directory were: 1: Multidisciplinary- Since hypermedia works are formed from and inhabit the intersections between disciplines, and since a field of study dedicated to hypermedia literature and art does not yet exist, NT2 had to compile multidisciplinary teams to describe and organize the works in the database. 2: Location and Identification- Since there is no previously existing database of hypermedia works, NT2 had to develop new strategies for locating and identifying the works cataloged. 3: Specialized Description Protocols- Due to a lack of formalized vocabulary specific to hypermedia works, the HAL Directory is organized around a unique bibliographic system, employing hypermedia-specific vocabulary, and a set of key words based on the pieces themselves rather than on preexisting research taxonomies. The key words relating to interactivity, for example, include 39 options that aim to describe as accurately as possible, a user’s experience with a particular work.

The inlet is about long and at the widest point and is shared between Aarhus and Odder Municipality. The south section of Norsminde Fjord has been drained and is today coastal meadows, marsh or wetlands with rushes, mainly used for grazing animals. It is these wetlands in the south of the fjord that is known as Kysing Fjord which is Natura 2000 site (no. 59) and European Union Special Protection Areas bird sanctuary (no. 30). The bird sanctuary has a special focus on the whooper swan but other rare birds also nest in the area.  History  Norsminde Fjord is an East Jutland Fjord, a glacial moraine valley, created during the Weichselian glaciation c. 20,000 to 70,000 years ago. The stream Rævs Å flows into the fjord and over time it has suffered silting and become increasingly shallow. In 1832 the southern part of the Fjord was drained and made into farmland or wet meadows for animal grazing. In 1942 the remaining fjord and surrounding meadows were designated a wilderness preserve. However, the drained lands proved fertile and a good investment so in the 1950s it was attempted to drain the rest of the fjord. The draining effort failed and instead a sluice was installed to control water levels and flooding. The areas that were drained is today known as Kysing Fjord, of drained wetlands consisting mostly of wet and coastal meadows. The area has suffered damage from fertilizer runoff and wastewater from Odder and Malling over the years causing issues with algae blooms that displace vegetation and animals. Kysing Fjord is today a natural preserve.  Nature preserve  Many species of birds are found at the fjord and the inner wetlands but the nature preservation has a special focus on the whooper swan. It is a migratory bird which eats underwater vegetation and forages on wintergreen meadows. During mild winters the whooper swan stays in the area from April to November and the flocks here has been recorded to reach some 12,000 birds. The number of swans wintering in the area has risen over the years, possibly as a result of milder winters or maybe an enlarged area suitable for foraging. In and around the fjord the most common species of birds are eurasian coot, northern lapwing, eurasian wigeon, mallard, golden plover, tufted duck, eurasian teal, mute swan, a number of waders and, during cold winters, the common merganser. White-tailed eagle and peregrine falcons also have a presence in the area, both very rare and endangered birds in Denmark. The dominant species at Norsminde Fjord are dabbling ducks, a result of the large number of surface algae caused by previous years nutrient pollution from poor wastewater management and fertilizer runoff.

Recorded after guitarist Rikk Agnew left the group, it was their only release recorded with guitarist Steve Roberts. The band broke up in August 1981, and when the EP was released two months later it was not well received. When the Adolescents re-formed five years later, a new lineup re-recorded all three songs from Welcome to Reality for their reunion album, 1987's Brats in Battalions. Background and recording The Adolescents lineup of singer Tony Brandenburg (who used the stage name Tony Cadena), bassist Steve Soto, drummer Casey Royer, and guitarist brothers Rikk and Frank Agnew released their debut album, Adolescents, in March 1981 on Frontier Records. Though Rikk Agnew had contributed heavily to the album, tensions between him and the other band members were leading to frequent arguments. Just a few months after the album's release, during a performance at the Starwood in West Hollywood, he abruptly threw his guitar and walked offstage, quitting the band. \\"Rikk and I began to have conflicting ideas and Rikk left, citing musical differences\\", said Brandenburg. He was replaced by Pat Smear, formerly of the Germs. The band was planning their first tour, to begin late that summer and last into the fall. \\"We needed to tour to survive\\", recalled Brandenburg. \\"We had been banned from every club in Hollywood that could hold us—the Starwood, the Roxy, and the Whisky—and a lot of people wouldn't go to Pasadena (Perkins Palace) or East L.A. (The Vex) to see us\\". Smear, however, did not want to tour, and so left the band in June after only three months to allow them to find a guitar player who would tour. Smear's replacement was Royer's roommate Steve Roberts, and the new lineup recorded the Welcome to Reality EP that July. It was produced by Thom Wilson, who had engineered and mixed Adolescents, and consisted of three songs. A fourth song, \\"Richard Hung Himself\\", co-written by Royer, was recorded and intended for the EP but was left off before release. It was released 24 years later on The Complete Demos 1980–1986. The band broke up the following month, before Welcome to Reality was released and before the planned tour had begun. Brandenburg later cited disagreements over the band's direction and his personal discomfort with their sudden popularity as reasons for the breakup. Release and reception Welcome to Reality was released in October 1981 on Frontier Records, but was not well received. \\"It went over like a lead balloon and we threw in the towel\\", said Brandenburg. In a retrospective review, Ned Raggett of Allmusic rated it two stars out of five, commenting that \\"the title track is a fairly indifferent fear-of-the-bomb rant, while 'Losing Battle' and 'Things Start Moving' have the same general pace of the band's best early songs, though not the same immediate memorability (even if the latter has an attractive, slightly droning guitar opening). It's a bit of a nothing way of bowing out.\\" Legacy After the Adolescents' breakup, Brandenburg formed a new band, the Abandoned, who released one album, Killed by Faith (1985).Blush, pp. 90–91. Soto and Frank Agnew joined Los Angeles punk band Legal Weapon, playing on their 1982 album Death of Innocence; Agnew remained with them for Your Weapon, released later that year, then moved on to Hvy Drt, playing on their 1985 Hvy Drt EP. Royer, meanwhile, started D.I., taking on the role of singer. He was joined by Roberts and Rikk Agnew for the D.I. EP (1983), which included a new version of \\"Richard Hung Himself\\" rewritten by Royer with new lyrics. Agnew then brought in his younger brother, Alfie Agnew, and the two remained in D.I. until 1987, playing on the albums Ancient Artifacts (1985) and Horse Bites Dog Cries (1986) and the Team Goon EP (1987). The Adolescents lineup of Brandenburg (now using the stage name Tony Montana), Soto, Royer, and Rikk and Frank Agnew played a reunion show in April 1986 at Fender's Ballroom in Long Beach, California which led to the band re-forming. They played more shows and began working on material for a new album, but Frank Agnew left the band after a few months and was replaced by his younger brother Alfie, then Royer left the group that August and was replaced by Sandy Hanson, formerly of the Mechanics. \\"Casey wanted to keep D.I. going, and I lost interest\\", said Frank. The new lineup recorded the Brats in Battalions album that summer, including new recordings of all three songs from Welcome to Reality. Songs from Welcome to Reality are performed on each of the band's live albums: All three songs appear on Live 1981 & 1986 (1989), \\"Welcome to Reality\\" and \\"Losing Battle\\" appear on Return to the Black Hole (1997), and \\"Welcome to Reality\\" and \\"Things Start Moving\\" appear on Live at the House of Blues (2004). The Welcome to Reality tracks were re-released on the compact disc version of Adolescents published by Frontier Records in 1990. Track listing Writing credits adapted from the EP's liner notes.

The resort is located on the Bürgenberg and comprises a total of 30 buildings, including four hotels and a number of sports facilities. It is the largest integrated hotel resort in Switzerland. The complex is built above ridge offering north-facing views of the lake 450 metres below. Linking resort and lake is the Bürgenstock railway. Views to the south encompass mountains and scattered settlements on their flanks. The resort is of cultural and historical significance.  History  Franz Josef Bucher and Josef Durrer (1841–1919) were businessmen from Kerns, Canton Obwalden. They had a sawmill and a factory making wood flooring in Kerns. To keep their workforces in employment, the two men built the Hotel Sonnenberg in Engelberg in 1869/70, which they were able to sell at a profit one year after completion. Their company Bucher & Durrer purchased Alp Tritt on the Bürgenberg in 1871 and applied the name Bürgenstock to their new hotel development. The Grand Hotel opened on 23 June 1873 under its original name of Hotel Kurhaus. Bucher acquired sole control of the company in 1877. In 1886 and 1887 he built a hydroelectric plant on the Engelberger Aa river in Buochs to power the funicular railway between the lake and the Bürgenstock and the Stanserhorn funicular railway. In 1888 the company opened the Bürgenstock railway and began provision of the resort's water supply. Also in 1888 the Park-Hotel opened, followed by the Bürgenstock Chapel in 1892, the Palace Hotel in 1904, and the erection of a number of villas to the east of the latter between 1900 and 1905. The Hammetschwand Elevator opened in 1905. Friedrich Frey-Fürst (1882–1953) purchased the Bürgenstock hotels in 1925. From 1925 to 1948 the three hotels underwent significant renovation. A golf course opened in 1928. Management of the resort passed to Friedrich Frey's son Fritz on the former's death in 1953. Fritz Frey made a number of changes to the buildings and infrastructure. During the tenure of Fritz Frey and his family, the actors Sophia Loren, Audrey Hepburn and Sean Connery and politicians such as Jimmy Carter and Henry Kissinger stayed as guests on the lakeside mountain. The family sold the Bürgenstock Resort to the major Swiss bank UBS in 1996. The buildings were acquired in 2000 by Richemont Héritage SA of Vich, Canton Vaud together with five other five-star hotels indebted to the UBS for about CHF 115 million. The company changed its name to Rosebud Hotels Holding SA in 2003 after disposing of its Hotel Richemont. The Barwa Real Estate Company, domiciled in the Emirate of Qatar, took a 50% holding in the company's assets in 2007 which, alongside the Bürgenstock hotels, comprised the Schweizerhof in Bern and Royal Savoy in Lausanne. The Barwa Real Estate Company separated from Rosebud Hotels Holding SA in 2008 to become sole owner of the Bürgenstock Resort. The Barwa Real Estate Company transferred its Swiss hotel portfolio to the Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment Company in 2009. The latter is wholly owned by the State of Qatar; its subsidiary QDHP Swiss Management AG was responsible for managing the Swiss hotel projects. In 2011 Katara Hospitality, a subsidiary of the Qatar Investment Authority (the Emirate of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund), became the new investor. The Bürgenstock Selection brand was created that same year. This incorporates the new Bürgenstock Resort, the Hotel Royal Savoy in Lausanne and the Hotel Schweizerhof in Bern. The Swiss activities were transferred in 2012 to Katara Hospitality Switzerland AG, domiciled in Zug. The latter is the company that operates the hotels in Switzerland. On the southern side of the Bürgenstock is the Villa Honegg, a hotel built and opened in 1906 by Emil Durrer (1873–1923), a nephew of Franz Josef Bucher. It remained a family-run establishment until 1977. Following further renovation, the hotel reopened in 2011. In the 1950s and 1960s Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer married in the chapel on the Bürgenstock in 1954. Sophia Loren and her husband Carlo Ponti resided for seven years in one of the chalets. Königin Ingrid von Schweden.jpgQueen Ingrid of Denmark on the Bürgenstock, late 1940s Audrey Hepburn auf dem Bürgenstock (01).jpgAudrey Hepburn on the golf course, mid-1950s German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer spent the summer months of July and August 1950 in the resort and conducted affairs of state there. Jawaharlal Nehru had a holiday in the resort in 1951, accompanied for the first time by his daughter Indira Gandhi. Two years later he met Austria’s foreign minister there, Karl Gruber. The film crew shooting the James Bond film Goldfinger spent a month at the Palace-Hotel in 1964 alongside Bond actor Sean Connery.  Buildings and extensions since 2014  The cornerstone for the new resort was laid on 26 March 2014. The resort on the Bürgenberg is completely car-free and comprises 30 buildings. These include four hotels ranging in standard from three to five star Superior and offering a total of 383 rooms and suites: the Bürgenstock Hotel (5* Superior), the Waldhotel – Healthy Living (5*), the Palace Hotel (4* Superior) and the Pension Taverne 1879 (3*). Also emerging is a conference centre capable of accommodating up to 900 persons. The resort also features 68 “residence suites”, 12 restaurants and bars. It is scheduled to open in summer 2017, and is planned to operate all year round. The total investment volume is expected to reach around CHF 500 million. The resort will have a spa with an indoor and an outdoor area and three swimming pools, a sauna, a Turkish bath, steam room, showers and whirlpool baths, and a gym. The Waldhotel Healthy Living will offer medical treatments including convalescence and revitalisation, diagnostics and medical check-ups, beauty and healthy ageing, weight management, and meditation. The 9-hole golf course was re-opened on 25 June 2016. On the same day, the foundation and the University of Teacher Education Lucerne opened a learning trail on the cliff path. CHF 43 million are being invested in monument and landscape conservation measures. The old Stickerei building has been restored to its original plans, while the historically important Palace-Hotel, which dates from 1906, is being renovated in compliance with requirements imposed by heritage and monument agencies. The Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National and Regional Significance (the KGS inventory) lists a number of buildings and facilities in the Bürgenstock Resort deemed worthy of protection. The inventory draws a distinction between assets of national importance (A assets) and of regional importance (B assets). \\"A\\" assets in the Bürgenstock Resort include the pool in the Bürgenstock Club, the Stickerei building, the Gübelin building, the weather station, and the “Rondelle”. The resort's \\"B\\" assets are the Palace- Hotel, the Blockhaus, the Spycher storage sheds, the Grand Hotel, the Restaurant & Pension Taverne 1879, the Bürgenstock Railway, and the Hammetschwand Lift. The buildings and facilities of the Bürgenstock Resort are also listed in the Federal Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites (ISOS). The Lake Lucerne landscape with Kernwald, Bürgenstock and Rigi is listed in the Federal Inventory of Landscapes and Natural Monuments of National Importance. In a 2012 study, BAK Basel Economics AG wrote that the new resort will provide economic benefits to the Central Swiss region. The study predicted that the new Bürgenstock Resort will attracted new affluent visitors to the region, generating 150,000 extra overnight stays. According to the study, revenues generated by the new Bürgenstock Resort once fully up and running could be in the region of CHF 100 million for the resort, and 40 million for its suppliers. The study estimates that the Bürgenstock project will generate annual tax revenues of about CHF 8 million for the cantons and municipalities of Central Switzerland. By 2020, the latter's cumulative tax revenues directly attributable to the resort's operations could reach CHF 33 million. It is estimated that one job is created outside the resort for every three inside it. In terms of employment in Canton Nidwalden's economy as a whole, the resort's share is 3.6 percent.

Cameron studied at the University of Iowa, where she earned a doctorate in geology and botany. Her interest in geology and her fieldwork took her to over 30 countries. In 1945, she wrote The Earth in Human Affairs, which relates geology with society, and many other papers on the subject. While starting her career in USGS, she worked in the Military Geology Branch. Best known for her advances regarding glacier deposits, Cameron was able to predict the location of peat deposits. Such predictions are useful in the search for water sources prior to developing agricultural lands. As a specialist in peat, she became a member of the Branch of Eastern Mineral Resources since 1969. Before Cameron joined the United States Geological Survey, she was a geology professor at Stephens College in Missouri, teaching earth science courses. During her time at the United States Geological Survey, Cameron received two awards. In 1977, she received the USGS' Meritorious Service Award. This award is the second-highest award and is given to employees who make an important contribution to science or have a notable career, among other criteria. In 1986, she revived the USGS' Distinguished Service Award. This award is the highest award that can be received in the department. Cameron argued for the inclusion of geology in general science courses for non-science majors at universities. She stated that learning about geology provides students with the opportunity to think about themselves in relation to their physical environments, and develop a connection with the elements of nature that they encounter everyday. General geology also teaches students skills such as critical thinking and looking for relationships between all things. Cameron created a rough curriculum outline with several objectives that could be divided into units. In the journal article, The Place of Geology In General Education (1944), Cameron compares geology to aviation. She states that students who are studying both geology and aviation have a better understanding because the concepts and maps associated with these areas of study greatly relate to each other. Cornelia Cameron created sketch maps of peat deposits, maps drawn from observations of landscapes without direct measurements. After joining the geological survey in 1951, Cameron concentrated mainly in the military aspects of geology. For the military, Cameron analyzed strategic sites that included analysis of a variety of metrics, including groundwater, suitability for building roads, and suitability for building airports. From 1972 through 1985, she served as vice- chairman of the U.S Committee of the International Peat Society. During this time, she was also a consultant for the Campobello international park commission, which would oversee the Roosevelt Campobello International Park. In the decades leading up to her death, Cameron studied peat as a soil additive and energy source. Her work helped identify more than 70 million tons of peat in the United States. She published dozens of papers on this subject and was senior author on a text talking about peat resources in Maine. Alongside the 110 total papers Cameron had published, she was also a senior author for an army field manual that relates to terrain intelligence.  Early life  Cameron was the daughter of two scientists. Her mother, Harriet Clearman Cameron, had a master's in geology and a PhD in botany. Her father was a professor of natural sciences. Cameron's father died in 1918 when she was only seven years old. Her parents, especially her mother, had a profound impact on her profession. Cameron's mother continued to do fieldwork with her until she was 103 years old.  Her papers  One of Cameron's papers, \\"Relationship between Peat Geochemistry and Depositional Environments, Cranberry Island, Maine\\", focused on a place called The Heath on Great Cranberry Island, Maine. She considered The Heath a great place to study the \\"lateral and vertical relationships between radically different peat types within\\" one square kilometer. There were two purposes for this research: to find out to \\"what extent depositional environments, peat-producing botanical communities, and chemical characteristics of peat can be correlated within a small bog/marsh,\\" and to show how peat characteristics can differ over short distances. She and her research team took samples of the peat and had them analyzed in a laboratory. They concluded that the \\"geometry of the depositional basin, the level of the water table, the proximity to marine waters, and the influx of inorganic material into the swamp/bog\\" all affected the plants and \\"inorganic content\\" of The Heath.Raymond, R. Jr., Cameron, Cornelia.C. and Cohen, A.D., 1987. Relationship between peat geochemistry and depositional environments, Cranberry Island, Maine. In: D.J. Boron (Editor), Peat: Geochemistry, Research, and Utilization. Int. J. Coal Geol., 8: 175–187. Cameron authored \\"The geology of selected peat-forming environments in temperate and tropical latitudes\\", a study for the International Journal of Coal Geology focused on her field observations. In this study, she noticed that trace elements in peat deposits are affected by the environment they are in when she found different levels of concentration and different elements in different environments. Cameron determined that these trace elements identify the type bedrock underneath the peat and how the peat transported from the source to the peat swamp. She concludes that the study of modern peat deposits will help with the study of ancient coal beds. This idea was corroborated by a paper by D.V Punwani called \\"Peat as an Energy Alternative\\", which stated that through the movement of Earth's crust, peat gets trapped, loses access to air, and gets put under extreme pressures, beginning the coalification process; this paper mentioned that peat is also referred to as young coal. Cornelia Cameron's paper in the Coal Geology is solidified.  Peat for energy  Peat is partially decayed organic matter, which is composed mostly of plant material. It is commonly found in wetland environments, such as bogs and swamps. This material is formed due to the high acidity of wetlands, which prevents the organic material from fully decaying and allows the organic material to accumulate over time. For a long time, peat has been used as an alternative heat and energy resource, and it can also be mixed with soil to modify its acidity and moisture retention, in order to support the growth of certain plants.National Geographic Society. “Peat: The Forgotten Fossil Fuel.” National Geographic Society, 9 Nov. 2012, www.nationalgeographic.org/media/peat-forgotten-fuel/.Andriesse, J.P. “Energy Use of Peat.” 9. ENERGY USE OF PEAT, FAO - FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS, 1988, www.fao.org/3/x5872e/x5872e0b.htm. Since World War II, there was a growing interest in the use of peat in the production of energy, particularly in many European countries who would undertake in large development programs of the harvesting and distribution of peat fuel. However, the fuel source isn't commercially used in very many countries, especially during periods where cheap oil is available in large supply. Also, since peat is composed of 90% water, more energy is used to evaporate the water in order to burn the peat and subsequently extract the energy, which will make it less efficient than fossil fuels. The use of peat over the years has been fluctuating due to cheaper alternatives for energy consumption and environmental concerns. The use of peat as an energy source was a cheaper option compared to the alternatives of oil, gas and coal. However, in the 1960s, the price of cheap oil and coal had an effect on peat usage across the world, causing the usage of peat to fall while the other alternatives began to rise.Sopo, Raimo. “Peat as an Energy Resource.” Peat as an Energy Resource  International Peatland Society, www.peatsociety.org/peatlands-and-peat/peat- energy-resource. Peat as an energy source was largely used in Ireland, England, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Poland, Finland, and the USSR.Andriesse, J.P. (1988). Nature and Management of Tropical Peat Soils. Retrieved from http://www.fao.org/3/x5872e/x5872e0b.htm In 1971, Finland passed the first national energy peat development program focusing on protecting peat lands as well as expanding on the existing peatland to make a total of 10 million cubic meters of peat land. This was then extended to 20 million cubic meters after the price of oil began to increase during and after the war with the Middle East. Peat as an energy source across the world continued to be beaten by cheaper alternatives, resulting in the drainage of many peat lands. When draining peatland, the land can then be used to make forests or for agricultural purposes. In Canada, most of the drained peatland was converted to agricultural land. During the “Mega-Rice” land conversion of Central Kalimantan in 1966, around one million hectares of peat land were converted for rice production and cultivation. Besides using other energy sources due to the cheaper cost, peat has also been seen as an environmental concern due to the CO2 released during combustion, making it a fossil fuel. However, the Finnish Ministry stated in “The Role of Peat in Finnish Greenhouse Gas Balances” that peat should be considered a biomass fuel instead of a fossil fuel. Peat will continue to be a fossil fuel till it is officially added to the list of renewable energy sources. There was a decline in the use of peat in the twentieth century since at this time, the use of oil and gas for cooking and fuel dominated. However, since electricity was in such high demand, electric power plants fueled by peat were developed to keep up with this demand. Peat most often was used in the 60–200 MW power plants, but more recently has been used in the range of 20–1000 kW. Aside from being a fuel source, peat can also be used as an insulator in buildings, since it is a poor heat conductor. The feasibility of using peat as an energy source in different areas comes down to economic factors. For instance, the local conditions of different areas would need to be surveyed, such as the availability of other energy sources, cost of peat, transportation costs and distances, and climate conditions. In the tropics and more developing countries, there is minimal technology for peat extraction. In developed countries, on the contrary, peat extraction has been practised for centuries. As a result, less developed regions must rely on the information and technology that developed countries have for peat extraction. When looking at peat as an energy source, multiple factors contribute to its usability. Peat has varying characteristics at different stages of its decomposition. Weakly decomposed peat cannot combust effectively. Moderately to well-decomposed peat is more suitable for combustion, and this is the stage of peat that is used for fuel/energy. The chemistry of peat also determines whether it makes a good energy source. This includes the carbon and hydrogen content in the peat, as well as the ash content. Peat is composed of the organic materials carbon and hydrogen, and the content of these elements in peat is what makes it suitable for combustion and therefore an energy source. Peat is also composed of inorganic materials, and these materials vary in quality and quantity. The quality and quantity of these inorganic materials contribute to the ash content, which is a factor that affects the usefulness of peat as fuel. Peat is usually mixed with mineral soil to increase the moisture-retaining capacity for sands. Peat with large mineral soil content has a higher ash content/value. Peat can be classified as \\"good quality peat\\" or \\"usable for fuel\\". Peat with ash values from 1–7 % is classified as good quality peat, whereas peats with ash values up to 14% are usable for fuel. SiO2 and Al2O3 in peat raise the melting point of the ash and raises the total ash content. CaO and Fe2O3 lower the melting points and decreases the total ash content. Depending on the region the peat is from, Sulphur contents of peat are typically low. Therefore, most peat has a similar Sulphur content to oil (contains no more than 0.3–0.4% of Sulphur). Therefore, peat is acceptable and comparable to oil as fuel.

History and classification A. laticeps is known from a single queen ant found in Russia. The specimen was described from a compression fossil preserved in diatomite deposits of the Bol’shaya Svetlovodnaya site. The site is exposed on the bank of Barachek Creek upstream from the creeks confluence with the Bol’shaya Svetlovodnaya River in the Pozharsky District, on the Pacific Coast of Russia. The fossil-bearing rocks preserve possibly Priabonian plants and animals which lived in and around a small lake near a volcano. The site has been attributed to either the Maksimovka or Salibez Formations and compared to the Bembridge Marls and Florissant Formation, both of which are Priabonian in age. At the time of description, the part and counterpart holotype queen specimen, numbers PIN 3429/1178 and PIN 3429/1173, was preserved in the A. A. Borissiak Paleontological Institute collections, part of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The fossil was first described by the trio of paleomyrmecologists Gennady Dlussky, Alexandr Rasnitsyn and Ksenia Perfilieva. In the type description, Dlussky, Rasnitsyn and Perfilieva coined the genus name Agastomyrma from a combination of the Latin agastus which means \\"pleasing\\" and Greek Myrmica meaning \\"ant\\". The specific epithet is derived the Latin laticeps that translates to \\"with a wide head\\". Agastomyrma is one of two extinct ant genera described by Dlussky et al from Bol’shaya Svetlovodnaya fossils in the 2015 paper. The other genus Biamomyrma is also a myrmicine, and differs from Agastomyrma in the structuring of the petiole and in the relative sizing of the queens head. Description The A. laticeps queen is preserved as a dorsal compression showing the upper surface of the head, thorax and abdomen, without fore-wings or antennae. The body length as preserved is estimated at , though portions of the head and the gaster are missing. A. laticeps is distinguished by the large size of the head relative to the body, the head being long while the mesosoma is . The head has rounded back corners and a straight back edge.

Formation and operations Bent, St. Vrain & Company was formed as a partnership between Charles Bent and Ceran St. Vrain in 1830. The following year, William Bent, brother of Charles, joined the company as a partner. The commercial basis for the company was the transport and sale of manufactured goods from St. Louis to Santa Fe, via the Santa Fe Trail, and the procurement and transportation of furs and buffalo robes in return. Its annual revenue from the fur trade, about $400,000, made them the largest American fur trade outfit next to the American Fur Company. The company owned stores in Santa Fe and Taos, and a mill at the latter place. It built a number of trading posts, called forts, in the Indian country, for trade with Native American hunters, French, Hispanic and American mountain men, as well as with teamsters, settlers and others on the Santa Fe trail.Crutchfield, Moulton & Del Bene 2011, p. 78-79.Thrapp 1988, vol.

It was written in 1925 and premiered on 5 October 1926 in Moscow Art Theatre, directed by Konstantin Stanislavsky. In April 1929 the MAT production was cancelled as a result of severe criticism in the Soviet press. On 16 February 1932, resulting from the direct interference of Joseph Stalin, it was re-started and continued until June 1941, to considerable public acclaim. It ran for 987 performances in the course of these ten years. There are three versions of the play's text. The first was written in July- September 1925. The title The Days of the Turbins was also used for the novel itself, the latter's Paris (1927, 1929, Concorde) edition was titled The Days of the Turbins (The White Guard). The play's second version (never published in Russian) was translated into German and first came out in Munich in 1934. The third version of the text was published in Moscow in 1955, supervised personally by Elena Sergeyevna Bulgakova.Commentaries to Дни Турбиных at the Russian Bulgakov site. Background Talberg's prototype Leonid Karum with his wife Varvara When the Moscow Art Theatre approached Bulgakov in 1925, suggesting that he should write a play for them to stage, the author has been toying with the same idea for some time. In 1920, while in Vladikavkaz, he'd written a play called The Turbin Brothers, which was set during the times of the 1905 Revolution, and since then has been thinking of coming up with some kind of sequel. As well as the novel The White Guard, which served as a blueprint for it, the play was based upon its author's personal experience in Kiev of late 1919 and early 1920, when, at the height of the Russian Civil War, the city succumbed to anarchy and violence. As the novel before it, the play had a strong autobiographical aspect to it. The description of the house of the Turbins corresponds to that of the house of the Bulgakov family in Kiev, now the Mikhail Bulgakov Museum. Bulgakov's maternal grandmother Anfisa Ivanovna, in marriage Pokrovskaya, was born Turbina, hence the name of the family. The character of Alexey Turbin could be seen as a self-portrait. Nikolka Turbin bears strong resemblance to the author's brother, Nikolai Bulgakov. The real person behind Elena Talberg-Turbina was Bulgakov's sister Varvara Afanasyevna.The White Guard at the Bulgakov On-line Encyclopedia The prototype for the cynical careerist Colonel Talberg was Varvara's husband Leonid Sergeyevich Karum (1888–1968), who first served under Hetman Skoropadsky, then joined Anton Denikin's army and ended up as an instructor in a Red Army military school. Such an interpretation of his character caused a family row and a rift between Bulgakov and the Karums. The character of Myshlayevsky apparently had no immediate real-life prototype (although some sources point at Nikolai Syngayevsky, the author's friend from the years of childhood) but by way of bizarre coincidence it 'found' itself one, in retrospect. During the 1926/1927 season the MAT offices received a letter addressed to Bulgakov, signed \\"Viktor Viktorovich Myshalyevsky\\". In the introduction, its author implied that Bulgakov had known him personally and 'expressed interest' in his life story. The letter told the story of a former White Army officer who had joined the Red Army, initially even with some enthusiasm, only to become totally disillusioned with the Bolshevik regime and the new Soviet reality. History The title page of the 'pirate' 1927 Riga- published version of The White Guard novel On 3 April 1925, the Moscow Art Theatre's Second Studio co-director (and later a respected Soviet reader in drama) Boris Vershilov invited Bulgakov to visit him at the theatre and suggested that the latter should write a play based upon The White Guard. Bulgakov set upon working on it in July and finished the first draft in September. That month he recited it for the audience of the theatre's actors and officials, which included Stanislavski. Its first version, closely following the novel's plotline, featured the characters Malyshev and Nai-Turs; Alexey Turbin in it was still an army doctor. Stanislavski found the original plotline overdrawn and laden with too many characters, some of them indistinguishable from some of the others. In the second draft there was no Nai-Turs, whose lines were given to Colonel Malyshev. By the January 1926 final casting, Malyshev was too, and Alexey Turbin became the artillery colonel, as well a kind of proponent for the ideology of the White movement. The next change was prompted by censors: the scene at the (Ukrainian nationalist leader) Symon Petliura's headquarters had to be removed because the atmosphere of anarchic violence there, apparently, resonated too strong with many people's reminiscences of the Civil War realities, relating to the atrocities committed by the Red Army. The title \\"The White Guard\\" also caused problems. Stanislavski, trying to appease the Repertoire Committee (Glavrepertkom) suggested that it should be called \\"Before the End\\" (Перед концом) which Bulgakov vehemently protested against. In August 1926 they finally agreed on The Days of the Turbins. On 25 September 1926 the play received the permission to be produced on stage, for the MAT exclusively, provided that the revolutionary hymn \\"The Internationale\\" should be played, crescendo, in the finale. Also, several new lines were given to Myshlayevsky, to indicate that he, bitterly disillusioned, as he was, with the White movement, was now ready to join the Red Army. The Days of the Turbins, directed by Stanislavsky, premiered on 5 October 1926. The first Soviet play portraying the White Army officers realistically, as not caricature villains, but likeable people, caused furore. In its first season, in 1926/1927 The Days of the Turbins ran for 108 performance, which was a record figure that year for Moscow theatres. Despite numerous attempts at obstructions, it became a huge a hit, especially with the non-party public. The Soviet press panned it, though, and as the time went by, the severity of the criticism increased. In April 1929 the MAT leadership succumbed to the pressure and the production was cancelled. \\"House of the Turbins\\", now Bulgakov Museum On 28 March 1930 Bulgakov sent a letter to the Soviet government, protesting against the treatment that the play had been subjected to in the Soviet press, mentioning 298 clips of the negative reviews he'd collected. He insisted that his aim was \\"to portray the intelligentsia, our country's finest social strata. In particular, to show, in the War and Peace tradition, one single family of intelligentsia, belonging to the dvoryanstvo, which, by the will of history itself had been thrown into the White Guard camp. Such [artistic move] is natural for a writer who himself comes from the intelligentsia.\\" His letter remained unanswered, but on 18 April, soon after Vladimir Mayakovsky's suicide, Bulgakov received a telephone call from Stalin who promised support and asked the author not to think of leaving the USSR.This resulted in Bulgakov's finally joining the MAT stuff and spending the last years of his life in a kind of 'internal exile', increasingly frustrated and now unable to go abroad, to visit his brother Nikolai who lived in Paris. Bulgakov sent Stalin some more letters; they remained unanswered, but on 16 February 1932, unexpectedly, the production of the Days of the Turbins was revived and the play re-entered the Moscow Art Theatre major repertoire. For Bulgakov this came as a surprise. \\"For reasons unknown to me, which I am not in a position to speculate upon, the Soviet government issued an extraordinary order for the MAT to re-start the production of The Days of the Turbins. For the author of that play this means only one thing: the huge bulk of his life has been risen from the dead, simple as that,\\" Bulgakov wrote to his friend, the literary and philosophy historian Pavel Popov (1892-1964).Shaternikova, Marianna. Why Did Stalin Loved The Days of the Turbuns. Почему Сталин любил спектакль «Дни Турбиных». Опубликовано: 15 октября 2006 г. Josef Stalin's personal interference in 1932 led to the re-start of the production and, arguably, saved Bulgakov's life in the years of the Great Purge It was obvious for both that this 'extraordinary' order could not have been issued by any one other that Stalin himself. Later it was revealed that the Soviet leader have seen the play at least fifteen times in the course of three years, often visiting the theatre incognito. Apparently, Stalin came to such a decision spontaneously, upon having returned from the Moscow Art Theatre disgusted with what he called 'a bad play', Alexander Afinogenov's Fear (tellingly, criticising the idea that the old intelligntsia should be integrated into the new Soviet society and, at that, quite popular with the party-controlled media), and impulsively decided that the 'good one', The Days of the Turbins, should be restored. His orders were promptly heeded. Stalin himself tried to downplay his own infatuation with the Days of the Turbins and its MAT production. In a letter to Vladimir Bill-Belotserkovski dated 2 February 1929, he argued: \\"...The play does more good than harm. Mind you, the general impression which the viewer leaves the theatre with, is that of the Bolsheviks' victory. \\"That the likes of the Turbins decide to lay down the arms and succumb to the will of the people, conceding the defeat, could mean only one thing: that the Bolsheviks are invincible.\\"Сталин И. В. Сочинения. Ответ Билль-Белоцерковскому . — Т. 11. — М.: ОГИЗ; Государственное издательство политической литературы, 1949. С. 326—329 Such a line of argument served as red herring for Stalin, the critic Marianna Shaternikova argued, for \\"there was nothing in the play which might have been interpreted even as a hint at the Bolshevism's invincibility. What there was instead is the all- pervading sense of total betrayal... as the White Army generals, the Hetman, the Germans and all those whom they considered friends or allies, abandoning [the Turbins].\\" A small detail found in the diaries of Elena Bulgakova shows how deeply moved the Soviet leader had been by the play. \\"You perform Alexey so good! Your Turbin's small mustachios even visit me in my dreams, I cannot forget them,\\" he told the MAT actor Nikolai Khmelyov.

Summary  Kiev of the late 1918 — early 1919 is in chaos; first Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi's regime falls, to be succeeded by the Directorate of Ukraine, then Symon Petliura comes in, only to be ousted from the city by the Bolsheviks. The family of the Turbins are caught in this turmoil, suffering their own tragedies, watching their whole world crash, amidst mindless violence, feeling abandoned and betrayed. Colonel Alexey Turbin and his brother Nikolai remain loyal to the White Movement and are determined to give their lives for it. Elena's husband Colonel Talberg flees the city with the German troops. Amidst horrors and uncertainty the family gathers to celebrate the New Year's Day. Publication history The Days of the Turbins was published for the first time in Russian in 1955, in Moscow, under Elena Bulgakova's personal supervision. Before that, in 1934, in Boston and New York City, it came out in English, translated by Y. Lyons and F. Bloch, respectively. Earlier, in 1927, its second version was translated into German by K. Rosenberg.  Production history  The Days of the Turbins' premiered on 5 October 1926 in Moscow Art Theatre, directed by Konstantin Stanislavsky, co-directed by Ilya Sudakov (1890-1969).Mikhail Bulgakov at the Moscow Art Theatre The cast included Nikolai Khmelyov as Alexey Turbin, Ivan Kudryavtsev as Nikolka, Vera Sokolova as Elena, Mark Prudkin as Shervinsky (his song has been performed for several years by the Bolshoi opera singer Pyotr Selivanov), Evgeny Kaluzhsky as Studzinsky, Boris Dobronravov as Myshlayevsky, Vsevolod Verbitsky as Talberg, Mikhail Yanshin as Lariosik, Viktor Stanitsyn as Von Shratt, Robert Schilling as Von Dust, Vladimir Ershov as Getman, Nikolai Titushin as the deserter, Alexander Anders as Bolbotun, Mikhail Kedrov as Maxim. The Days of the Turbins enjoyed enormous success. Bulgakov's secretary I.S. Raaben (who'd typed the novel The White Guard and who was invited to the theatre by Bulgakov personally), remembered: \\"That was astounding. All these things were still very much alive in the people's memories. There were fits of hysteria, people fainted, seven people were driven away by ambulance, for there were lots of people in the audience who'd come through the Petlyura horrors, and all those Civil War hardships.\\" The publicist Ivan Solonevich remembered an episode, with the White Army officers on stage after having drunk some vodka, were supposed sing the anthem \\"God Save the Tsar!\\" in a ramshackle, disheartened manner. \\"Then something inexplicable happened. The whole audience started to rise to their feet. The actors' voices strengthened. People were standing and silently weeping. Next to me, an old worker, my Party chief, rose up too. He later tried helplessly to rationalize what had happened. I helped him by saying that was mass hypnosis. But that was something much more than that... The directors received the orders to stage the episode in such a way so as to make it look derogatory, and the rendition insulting for the old Russia's hymn. For some reason they failed to do so and that proved to be the reason why the production was finally cancelled.\\"Solonevich, Ivan. Solving the Mystery of Russia // Солоневич И. Л. Загадка и разгадка России. М.: Издательство «ФондИВ», 2008. С.451 In April 1929 the production was cancelled. On 16 February 1932, due to the direct interference of Joseph Stalin, it was revived, and continued to run until June 1941. The Days of the Turbins had 987 runs in the course of these ten years. Critical response Throughout its first three years in the Moscow Art Theatre the play was severely criticised in the Soviet press, with numerous celebrities like Vladimir Mayakovsky, joining the chorus of detractors. The minister of education Anatoly Lunacharsky (writing for Izvestia on 8 October 1926) insisted that the play amounted to the apology of belogvardeyshchina. Later in 1933 he called it \\"the drama of a restricted, sly even, capitulation\\". Novy Zritel (Modern Viewer, on 2 February, 1927) described is as the \\"cynical attempt to idealize the White Army\\". What seemed to enrage the critics most was the fact that the White Army officers in the play were portrayed almost as Chekhov-type characters. The future Glavrepertkom chief O. Litkovsky (1892-1971) called the play \\"the Cherry Orchard of the White movement\\" and asked rhetorically: \\"The sufferings of the landowner Ranevskaya, who is about to have her cherry orchard ruthlessly axed, what bearings do they have for the Soviet theatre-goers? And should we care for the nostalgia suffered by immigrants, either external or internal, for the White movement, so timelessly deceased?\\" The only review that could be said to be positive was that of N. Rukavishnikov in Komsomolskaya Pravda who, replying to the poet Alexander Bezymensky who called Bulgakov 'the neo-bourgeous scum', argued that \\"now, as we are approaching the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution... it is quite safe to portray [the 'white' officers] in a more realistic manner\\" and that \\"the viewer has had enough of the agitprop-spawned hairy priests and fat capitalists in bowler hats.\\" Bulgakov's play's secret admirer, though, proved to be Joseph Stalin, who admittedly watched the play in MAT at least fifteen times and invariably spoke of it in rapturous terms, according to Valery Shanayev who also mentioned that there were several Bulgakov's books in the Soviet leader's Kremlin library. It was due to Stalin's personal orders that the play was re-installed and soon became part of what was known as the MAT's major repertoire. Modern critics consider the play the peak of Bulgakov's development as a playwright and a 20th-century drama classic.Schwartz, Anatoly. Thinking of Bulgakov. Анатолий Шварц. «Думая о Булгакове».

Until recently, the constituents of this family were classified in the family Tiphiidae, but multiple studies have independently confirmed that thynnids are a separate lineage.  Description  Most species are small, but they can be up to 30 mm long. The females of some subfamilies (all Diamminae, Methochinae, and Thynninae) are wingless, and hunt ground-dwelling (fossorial) beetle larvae, or (in one species) mole crickets. The prey is paralysed with the female's sting and an egg is laid on it so the wasp larva has a ready supply of food. In species where both sexes are winged, males are similar in size to the females, but are much more slender. The males of species with wingless females, however, are often much larger than the females and have wings, the adults mating in the air, with the female carried by the male's genitalia. Adults feed on nectar and are minor pollinators. As some of the ground- dwelling scarab species attacked by thynnids are pests, some of these wasps are considered beneficial as biological control agents.  Taxonomy  Thynnidae genera are classified as follows: Diamma bicolor female (subfamily Diamminae) photographed in Australia Myzinum quinquecinctum males (subfamily Myzinae) photographed in Oklahoma. Agriomyia sp. male (subfamily Thynninae), photographed in Australia. A pair of Zaspilothynnus sp. mating (subfamily Thynninae), photographed in Australia. The male is larger and has wings.

Dr. Oriedo was a tripartite laureate; and a recipient of the coveted Extramural Medical Research Grant presented by the National Institute of Health (NIH), United States of America (U.S.A.). What is more, he was an academician, author, a linguist, and an East African statesman of his day. Albeit a caritas assent for politics per se and the incessant lobbying by his fellow countrymen and a cadre of political confrères—among them his confidante Tom Mboya—he was antithetical to donning sumptuous political office; he gave precedence to the activism of healthcare, socioeconomic, and intellectual infrastructure needs of the region. As a frontier statesman and a scientist, he was an ardent patron of academics, healthcare, and socioeconomic development in East and Central Africa. He developed an interdisciplinarity pioneering approach that connected the struggle for political freedom in Kenya with fully integrated healthcare, intellectual, socioeconomic, and civil infrastructures; especially in the rural regions that bore the brunt of disease epidemics and its dire socioeconomic and sociocultural consequences. Antecedently, he embraced a revolutionary du jour epidemiological perspective towards the economic and intellectual consequences of disease or public health strategy across the East and Central African region.

His mother was a staunch advocate of women's rights and literacy in Kenya. Albeit a closeness with his mother, the relationship with his father was estranged.

Diss. 2012.Interesting to note that his father, Esau Oriedo, as a district representative to the Local Native Council (LNC) of North Nyanza — a.k.a. North Kavirondo District Council — was an ardent advocate for literacy and higher education, and a key protagonist in the founding of the school under the auspices of the North Kavirondo District LNC in 1932. He attended the prestigious Royal Institute of Medicine & Public Health at Nairobi; graduating in 1950. He was a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Great Britain. He attained DPH postgraduate education in epidemiological tropical medicine in Europe at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine a constituent college of the University of London; and was a fellow at the Dutch Royal Tropical Institute foundation in The Netherlands, and the Tulane University's Medical College's School of Tropical and Infectious Diseases at New Orleans in United States. He attended and contributed to a myriad of scientific conferences and proceedings, lectures, and speaking engagements in East and Central Africa, Sudan, North America, Australia, Oceania, India, Hong Kong, and South Africa. He was the first and the youngest native East and Central African epidemiologist in the field of tropical medicine and infectious diseases—both as researcher and a clinical practitioner in the spread, control, and eradication of infectious agents. His pioneering parasitological epidemiology medical research and resultant modalities have received global acclaim and application.Adler, S. \\"Leishmania.\\" Advances in parasitology 2 1964: 35-96. He was a key champion of indigenous medical research and the dissemination of homegrown scientific medical information—such as, new clinical modalities, field studies and discoveries, etc.—via cooperation with indigenous and overseas scholarly reviewed publications, medical panels, and scientific proceedings. He foresaw this informational approach as an effective and dynamic forum for interchange of knowledge and viewpoints amongst various indigenous healthcare communities and their counterparts abroad; a mechanism for the documentation and dissemination of vital information on local diseases within the East and Central African region. His epidemiological medical research of the East African leishmaniasis or kala-azar (black fever) has bred critical knowledge for worldwide use in both private and public health sectors, and civil societies.Oriedo et al. \\"Studies in the epidemiology of East African Leishmaniasis: 1.

In 1964 he attended, as an invited expert panelist, the XII International Congress of Entomology at London, United Kingdom.The XII International Congress of Entomology.

International conference on primary health care, Alma-Ata, USSR, 6–12 September 1978 Geneva: WHO, 1978. This cognizance is evident in his intrepid and transformative role in East Africa's healthcare, socioeconomic, sociocultural, and intellectual infrastructures. In 1960 he directed a healthcare and hygiene strategy of tactical, strategic, operational, and performance indexing; a short-term and long-term planning strategy based on the application of preventative modalities that helped shift the medical science paradigm—in East Africa—away from the undue emphasis on curative means, and more so towards a balanced approach. That which effectually integrated strategic epidemiological knowledge with tactical, operational, and situational curative approaches.The colonial medical service in British East Africa. British Colonial Medical Services, LondonThe Government of Kenya \\"Colonial Medical Service Microfilm Collection; Kenya National Archives: Daily Correspondence and Reports 1930-1967.\\" (2015).Robbed of his intrepid and prescient advocacy at the fore personally, the region's healthcare, akin to other civil infrastructures became derelict. In the course of his tenure the region witnessed markedly sustained improvement in schoolchildren's health and hygiene, public health (stemming of major disease epidemics and better sanitary conditions), and seamless integration of interdisciplinary and interagency resourcing. A tenure accredited with a maximization of key quality metrics and improvement in performance outcomes. He promoted and nurtured coordinated approaches, amongst healthcare practitioners and related bodies, to facilitate the most effective seamlessly integrated dispensary and operations of public health and other civic and societal welfare services. As of 1950 until his abrupt and inexplicable death in 1966, he is credited with stemming the tide of numerous endemic and pandemic diseases in the East and Central African regions and the Sudan; and a forfending of entire indigenous populations from imminent extinction. The following are examples of those striking feats.The Kenya Colony and Protectorate, Annual Medical Report, 1952, Nairobi, Government Printer, 1953. In October 1952, the young BV Oriedo's skills were put to the test when he was tasked to lead efforts to stem a major epidemic outbreak of a deadly parasitic Kala-azar (black fever) or visceral leishmaniasis disease in Kenya, and parts of Uganda. The epidemic had also manifested itself in the Sudan. Coming to the fore personally, he took a practical approach and relocated himself to the remote hinterland outpost District Hospital and Public Health Office at Kitui in South Eastern Kenya; the region hardest hit by the epidemic. He devised a savvy strategy to stem the tide of the epidemic, and saved thousands of indigenous lives. In 1954 the disease was arrested. In 1954 he spearheaded a successful government campaign to stem typhoid epidemic in present-day Kenya and Uganda. The North Kavirondo region of Mt. Elgon in Kenya—the Bungoma realm (presently Bungoma County in the former Western Province of Kenya) was one of hardest-hit areas. The disease was wreaking havoc amidst the ethnic Bukusu population; threatening to decimate the ethnic group. He employed his charisma (to build effective stakeholder partnership and respective rapports with local native elders and traditional entities), vigilant statesmanship, and technical acumen to effectually stem the epidemic and save the local population from imminent decimation. In 1960 the colonial authorities tasked him with formulating a roadmap to guide and coordinate an interterritorial, interdisciplinary and interagency crisis-management team to deal with kwashiorkor crisis—a disease with high mortality-rates among infants and children. He successfully focused on the Kikuyu ethnic group, one of the localities where the disease was endemic. The lessons learnt from the Kikuyu campaign gave impetus to an effective regional strategy. In 1959 he spearheaded an intensified malaria eradication campaign in the East African highlands that helped to reduce malaria epidemics in the region. In 1964 he was a recipient of a coveted medical research grant furnished by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH), Extramural Research Program. He was a laureate and a tripartite fellow at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the Dutch Royal Institute, and Tulane University's Medical College's School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine. A confidante of Tom Mboya, he allied with Mboya to successfully champion American education opportunities for East African Students. In the late 1950s (and thereafter) he was a silent force behind the fostering of indispensable rapports with likeminded contemporaries abroad that led to the inception of higher education opportunities in North America for talented East African students. He was an ardent patron of academics, healthcare, and socioeconomic development in East Africa. While fighting disease epidemics across the region he'd witnessed the abysmal conditions of the civil and other key infrastructures in large the segments of the country, which had led him to explicate that excessive emphasis was being placed on the political fulcrum at the detriment of critical socioeconomic, healthcare, and intellectual infrastructure rudiments.Kitching, Gavin N. Class and Economic Change in Kenya: The making of an African petite bourgeoisie 1905-1970. Yale University Press, 1980. This experience caused him to direct his skills and influence, ardently, crusading for the latter, while engaging peripherally in the former. As a matter of fact, he was but a handful of native Africans to approach the pursuit of \\"political\\" independence with an infallible apprehensive optimism. He favored blending the liberation movement with a creation of a robust and dynamic intellectual infrastructure capable of bringing into being an adequate cadre of erudite native professionals needed to sustain a practicably independent Kenyan state. Consequently, he declined a career in politics, despite being incessantly lobbied by his associates to do so, among them Tom Mboya; who were all in all au courant with his intuitively charismatic oratory, articulacy, and situational leadership skills, coupled with his acumen for local and international affairs and geopolitics which were congruent with the needs of the liberation movement in Kenya, and the wider East Africa.In a communiqué, he cautioned the nascent Kenyan political cadre of the liberation movement against a gullibility towards an impetuous independence—opining that such impetuous move, meagerly developed civil institutions, could lead to a vacuous independence and vassalage statehood, unless wholesome tactical and strategic civil institution infrastructures were in place to remedy the situation at the time of independence. He argued that Africans du jour had yet to achieve sufficient critical-to-success intellectual, healthcare, and socioeconomic resources and infrastructure for a comprehensive wholesome liberation—Africanized self-governance. During his epidemiological research and fight against disease epidemics, in the rustic and urbanite regions across East and Central Africa, he’d come face-to-face with the abominable high rates of poverty among the native populations those regions, the economic hardship that was a consequence of the repugnantly undue health care and hygienic woes which most aboriginals endured.Oriedo, BV \\"Bully\\". Unpublished Personal Memoirs and Letters of Blasio Vincent Oriedo 1954 - January 1966. Afterwards, he served, at Tom Mboya's behest, as a member of Mboya's multidisciplinary economic development team from 1965 till his death in January 1966.The Government of Kenya \\"Development plan for the period from 1st July 1964 to 30th June 1970\\" Kenya Economic Policy, Nairobi, Government Printer, 1964[microform]. He was a staunch adversary of maladroitness and the abuse of public trust; utterly stubborn—an uncompromising scrupulous—and demonstrative disdain for and impatient towards ineptitude. He was an outspoken critic of vice by those in power; thus, his policies became anathema to the vestiges of colonial Kenya, and most postcolonial bureaucrats and political elites of the embryonic independent Kenya. Proof positive, in 1965, upon his return from a conference in the Netherlands and other official engagement in Europe, he summarily terminated employment of several expatriates and native personnel for graft, ineptitude, and absconding from duty.Republic of Kenya. \\"Notice of Appointments and Personnel Changes: Public Health and Medical Officers, Ministry of Health and Housing.\\" The Kenya Gazette. Nairobi: The Government of The Republic of Kenya, 1966. His actions albeit justifiably de jure met with ad hominem assails from a cadre of bureaucrats and political elites; nevertheless, he stood his ground and refused to be intimidated into rescinding the edicts. In his point of view these individuals’ embrace of public service was solely a means to an end; such that theirs was a dichotomous embodiment of a pernicious approach to public interest. He was a fluent speaker and writer of English, Dutch, Kiswahili, Luganda, Luhya, Dholuo, Kamba, and Kikuyu languages. Consonant with his fêted cerebral abilities, he was a trendsetter and socialite who boasted a charismatic persona, splendid nobility; a prescient interlocutor with a quick wit to boot. A cadre of multidisciplinary and racially diverse (Africans, Indo-Asiatics, Caucasians, Arabs, etc.) contemporaries from across East Africa flocked to his residence to indulge in social intercourse—interchange of ideals and ideas, entertainment, debate local and international affairs and geopolitics du jour. He was known to his contemporaries as \\"Jaraha”—a hybrid Kiswahili-Dhuluo idiom for “en vogue socialite” or the “cosmopolitan”! His pals encompassed such international luminaries as Tom Mboya (d. 1969)—with whom they were confidantes; Sir Philip Edmund Clinton Manson-Bahr (d. 1966)—the son-in-law of Sir Patrick Mason, the doyen founder of the field of tropical medicine; Dr. Apollo Milton Obote—led Uganda to independence from Britain in 1962, becoming Prime Minister and the President twice; Prof. Hillary Ojiambo; Masinde Muliro; Charles Njonjo; Kitili Maluki Mwendwa; Elijah Wasike Mwangale; Paul Ngei; Fred Kubai; Achieng Oneko; Joseph Otiende; Dr Julius Gikonyo Kiano; Argwings Kodhek; Dr. B. A. SouthgateBritish Colonial Medical Services, London—British Colonial Medical office, London; Dr. R. Bowen; and Dr. R. B. Heisch; to name but a few.  Early life  Dr. BV Oriedo was born to Esau Khamati Oriedo (d. 1 December 1992) and Evangeline Olukhanya Ohana Analo-Oriedo (d. 11 July 1982), both from western Kenya's Luhya tribe of Africa's Bantu lineage. His mother was a homemaker, a domestic economics educator, and an ardent advocate of women rights. Whereas his father was a consummate Kenyan statesman, politician (1910s – 1960s), and an anti-colonialism activist and freedom fighter who had been detained, 1952–1956, alongside Paramount Chief Koinange and Jomo Kenyatta (the first President of the Republic of Kenya), and a cadre of other anti-colonialists during the campaign for Kenya's independence from the British rule. Esau Oriedo was also an entrepreneur and trade unionist, a staunch crusader of Christianity's embrace of indigenous African cultures, philanthropist, and a veteran of World War I and World War II as a soldier in the King's African Rifles (KAR) regiment of the British Army. Albeit enjoying a close relationship with his mother, the relationship with his father was estranged. He ran away from home as a child. His formative years were spent with his paternal uncle, Bernard Walter Amukhale Oriedo, who helped raise him. It has been argued that his uncle played an influencing role in Dr. BV Oriedo's decision to actualize a healthcare vocation even though his father had wanted him to pursue a business and political careers.  Early and Higher Education  He received early education at government and mission schools, and sat, successfully with distinction, for Cambridge School Certificate in 1946 at the former Government African School at Kakamega in North Nyanza (present-day Kakamega High School at Kakamega in western Kenya). He attended the prestigious Royal Institute of Medicine & Public Health (RIMPH), an elite conjoined Government College at Kabete in suburban Nairobi, Kenya which catered to cerebrally gifted scholars in East and Central Africa; where he pursued an interdisciplinary degree in medicine—with focus on public health, hygiene, and disease prevention medicine program. During his tenure of study at the Royal Institute of Medicine & Public Health, he secured an internship as a staff researcher assistant with the Division of Insect-Borne Diseases at Medical Research Laboratory, Nairobi. In 1950 he completed his college education at the RIMPH, graduating with high honours. In the same year of his college graduation he successfully completed the board certification exams, administered from London in Great Britain; he became a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of London. The certification and licensure qualified him for a job classification of a senior public health officer — a rank exclusively earmarked for Briton or Caucasian medical expatriates possessing Great Britain medical degrees or analogous European qualifications. Moreover, his qualifications exceeded the requirements for employment by the Colonial Medical Service — the organization responsible for dispensation of healthcare services and policy initiatives in the British Overseas Territories.Crozia, Anna.

His research thesis was on the vector-borne tropical diseases; it focused on the epidemiology of East African leishmaniasis (kala-azar), and attained a DPH. In 1957 he was a recipient of an associate research scientist fellowship from Tulane University's Medical College's School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at New Orleans in United States—he continued, fruitfully, to collaborate his work in East Africa with Tulane University until his precipitously inexplicable death in January 1966.John B.

He worked feverishly, with diligent acumen, effectively combining vocational duties and scholarship research with travel abroad to various international scholarly medical conferences and special proceedings to promote awareness of the tropical diseases in Africa; and to help stimulate funding for research and drug discovery to stem epidemics and other preventable diseases on the continent. An epic accomplishment for an under 30-year old native African at the apogee of European colonialism in East Africa! In 1959 he gained full membership to The Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene—a London-based organization promoting the study, control and prevention of tropical disease, and facilitation of discussion and exchange of information among those interested in tropical diseases and international health, and the overall promotion of the work of those interested in these objectives. In 1962, through his collaborative research with Tulane University's Medical College's School of Tropical and Infectious Diseases, he was endowed with a prestigious extramural medical research grant from the NIH—an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.Institute of Current World Affairs, The United Stated States of America: \\"Medical Research activities in the British colonial territories of Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, and Zanzibar funded by the institute and facilitated via the East Africa High Commission (EAHC): The East African Bureau of Research in Medical and Hygiene\\". Unpublished newsletter correspondences, 1948 - 62.  Professional life  Throughout his career he was tenured at the Ministry of Health and Housing, Nairobi, Kenya, and the Nairobi-based Division of Insect-Borne Diseases at Medical Research Laboratory under the auspices of the British Colonial Medical Services. The inception of his epidemiological vocation dates to 1950 after he attained a diploma in public health and preventive medicine (DPH)from the Royal Institute of Medicine & Public Health. At that same period, at the age nineteen, he became the youngest native person in the East and Central African region to autonomously engage in active interdisciplinary medical research in epidemiology and parasitology. After an efficacious completion of a London (Britain) administered board certification exams and licensure, he was actualized in 1951 to the rank of a senior (principal) public health officer under the auspices of the Ministry of Health and Housing, Nairobi, Kenya. Thus, becoming the first and the only native person, du jour, to hold such commission across the British East Africa Colony and Protectorate. He was later to become the first native East African epidemiologist in the field of tropical medicine and infectious diseases. He served as an epidemiologist in dual capacity under the aegis of the Colonial Medical ServicesWall, Rosemary. \\"Practising Colonial Medicine: The Colonial Medical Service in British East Africa.\\" Social History of Medicine 22.1 (2009): 215-217. and the Ministry of Health and Housing in the colonial and post-colonial Kenya. His consummate and pioneering parasitological epidemiology and medical research, and epidemiological mapping of pestilences and preventive modalities in the field of tropical medicine and insect-borne infectious diseases in East and Central African have received global acclaim and application. Antecedently, his interdisciplinary medical acumen; dedication to public service; selflessness; and ability to connect with local African villagers helped stem disease- epidemic outbreaks and save thousands of native lives; and to improve the quality of living across the East and Central African region and the Sudan. Mournfully, historiography focuses on either the European doctors or the non- white subordinates of the various African Colonial Medical Services, whereas non-white personnel, such as Dr. BV Oriedo who worked contemporaneously in higher status positions, have received very little attention or no acknowledgement.Greenwood, Anna, and Harshad Topiwala.

Indian Doctors in Kenya, 1895–1940. by Greenwood and Topiwala which cogently contextualizes lack of attention and the unheralded fate of African and Indian healthcare practitioners, such as Dr. BV \\"Bully\\" Oriedo, who worked contemporaneously in higher status positions within the British African Colonial Medical Services. \\"It is very curious that Indian [and African] doctors have been ignored in the colonial medical history of Africa. Although scholars have examined the European doctors of the various African Colonial Medical Services, non-white personnel have received comparatively little attention. Some studies have looked at the lower ranked African personnel, but the experiences of the Indian [and African] doctors that worked contemporaneously in higher status positions have received no attention. Indeed, the studies of non-European doctors in the Indian and African Empires have been so infrequent that one could be forgiven for thinking that Indians and Africans had no access to medical education and therefore were not employed in anything other than positions that did not require professional qualifications. Mark Harrison has briefly touched upon the Indian staff cohort of the Indian Medical Service (IMS) and Ryan Johnson has examined the progressive exclusion of the small numbers of black doctors from the West African Medical Service from the beginnings of the twentieth century. But these studies are exceptions, with much of the historiography focusing on either the white elites or the black subordinates, with little or no acknowledgement of non-white qualified practitioners. Indeed, even the broad histories of the East African medical administration written by Anne Beck in the 1960s and 1970s did not consider the work of Indians [and Africans who worked contemporaneously in higher status positions] within the colonial health department.\\" In 1950 he was selected to lead a handful of medical students from Kenya to attend the Conference of the World Health Organization on Malaria at Kampala, Uganda. Albeit tenured both at the Nairobi-based Division of Insect-Borne Diseases at Medical Research Laboratory[Notes 6], and the Ministry of Health and Housing during and post-colonial British rule, he shunned the city comforts du jour in the interest of serving the aboriginal populations of the African Great Lakes region, going to the fore personally. He spent most of his time in disease- ravaged remote villages, meticulously implementing curative and preventative measures; recording observations and mapping out diseases, authoring and disseminating reports.He was a dedicated medical research scientist and prolific technical writer. He meticulously gathered and documented clinical experiments and patient biomedical data, patient biometric screening, and practical field observations. This is evident by the innumerable notebooks which he accumulated. His cerebral abilities and immense potential in the field of tropical medicine and infectious vector-borne diseases was, beforehand, recognized by Sir Philip Edmund Clinton Manson-Bahr, MD, (d. November 1966) of the British Colonial Medical Services and renowned for his contributions to tropical medicine; and the son-in-law of Sir Patrick Mason, the doyen founder of the field of tropical medicine. Sir Manson-Bahr enlisted the young researcher to assist in his work on tropical medicine and infectious diseases in East African[21]; and later, elsewhere within the British Empire, largely under the auspices of the Colonial Medical Service—the personnel section of the Colonial Service, employing the healthcare professionals who tended to the health of both the colonial staff and the local populations of the British Empire. In 1951 Sir Manson-Bahr invited him to attend the \\"Conference of Specialists on infectious tropical diseases: Filariasis in the South Pacific\\", held at Papeete, Tahiti, August–September, 1951; of which Sir Manson-Bahr was a principle organizer and interlocutor. FilariasisThe Filariasis Research Unit was established in the British colonial East Africa in 1949. 1950 the British colonial East Africa High Commission assumed direct responsibility of the unit. Its establishment was at the initiative of the Colonial Medical Research Committee. was increasingly of concern in the colonial East Africa du jour. The two men would subsequently foster a close friendship and collaboration in the field of infectious diseases and tropical medicine. Moreover, Sir Manson-Bahr in conjunction with the British Colonial Medical Services and the East African Bureau of Research in Medicine and Hygiene (East Africa High Commission) featured markedly in the meritorious efforts that earnt him a 1954 research fellowship to study tropical medicine & parasitological epidemiology in the United Kingdom at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. In 1964 he was invited to panel of specialists at the XII International Congress of Entomology at London, United Kingdom. Campaign Against Infectious Disease Epidemics He promoted and nurtured coordinated approaches, amongst healthcare practitioners and related bodies, to facilitate the most effective seamlessly integrated dispensary and operations of healthcare, socioeconomic, and other social welfare services. He was presciently cognizant of the adverse socioeconomic, sociocultural, and socio-ecological consequences of disease or injury on individuals, communities and civil infrastructures, or organizations. He effectively synergized with all key stakeholders, in a robust and dynamic interdisciplinary bilateral or multilateral partnership, via a wholesome stakeholder-engagement whose desired key outcome was to formulate and implement disease prevention initiatives that were evidence-based, and both practicable and transformative, tailored towards the target-population, and outcome-driven. These initiatives were performance indexed— vis-à-vis, delivering measurable performance. As of 1950 until his abrupt and inexplicable death in 1966, he is credited with stemming the tide of numerous endemic and pandemic diseases in the East and Central African regions and the Sudan; and a forfending of thousands of human lives. In 1959 he spearheaded an intensified malaria eradication campaign in the East African highlands that helped to reduce malaria epidemics in the region.Roberts, JMD \\"The control of epidemic malaria in the highlands of western Kenya.

Nairobi: KEMRI/Wellcome Trust Collaborative Programme; 1999 = Kala-azar (black fever) or visceral leishmaniasis epidemic = In October 1952 the young BV Oriedo's skills were put to the test when he was tasked to lead efforts to stem a major epidemic outbreak of black fever disease in Kenya, and parts of Uganda. The epidemic had also manifested itself in the Sudan. Kala-azar (black fever) or visceral leishmaniasis is a deadly parasitic disease endemic to the tropics, subtropics, and southern Europe. He took a hands-on approach relocated himself to the remote hinterland outpost District Hospital and Public Health Office at Kitui in Kenya; the region hard-hit by the epidemic. He devised a savvy strategy to stem the tide of the epidemic, and saved thousands of lives. In 1954 the disease was arrested.It’s utterly incomprehensible and outright iniquitous that following Dr. Oriedo’s precipitously inexplicable death at age 34 the postcolonial Kenyan authorities and those who succeeded him were derelict of the valuable progress, successes, and a robustly dynamic public health infrastructure he’d attained and implemented via his ardent and industrious efforts to stem not just the black fever disease but also a plethora of other tropical diseases including malaria, typhoid, and malnutrition. Not only did the postcolonial Kenyan authorities and those who succeeded him fail to sustain his achievements, but also critical resources were deallocated leading to dilapidation of civil infrastructure and a lack of a meaningful public health strategy. Today, in Kenya and East Africa, tropical diseases such as black fever and malaria have become \\"Neglected Tropical Diseases\\" (NTD)! = Enteric or Typhoid fever epidemic = In 1954 he spearheaded a successful government campaign to stem typhoid epidemic in present-day Kenya and Uganda.Kohn, George C. Encyclopedia of plague and pestilence: from ancient times to the present. Infobase Publishing, 2007. Once more his expertise was needed by the colonial administration in Kenya and the British Colonial Medical Services in London, to spearhead efforts to stem a major epidemic outbreak of another disease, typhoid or enteric fever—a fatal multisystemic disease. The North Kavirondo region of Mt. Elgon in Kenya—the Bungoma realm (presently Bungoma County in the former Western Province of Kenya) was one of hardest-hit areas. The disease was wreaking havoc amidst the ethnic Bukusu population; threatening to decimate the ethnic group. Yet again, he employed his charisma, vigilant statesmanship, and technical functional acumen to effectually stem the epidemic and save the local population from imminent decimation. His achievement was recognized accordingly among the Bukusu people who denoted him a great leader and healer by officially crowning him with an honorary title of “omukasa”—a paramount Bukusu chieftain. By leveraging from his notably efficacious Bukusu strategy he made it possible to swiftly stem the disease and save lives in Kenya and Uganda, and other East African regions. This feat of accomplishment earned him a research stipend by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine at London, United Kingdom. = The Fight Against Kwashiorkor— a protein deficiency disease = In the 1940s kwashiorkor was an ill-defined and one of the widespread nutritional disorders in East Africa and other regions of the African continent.Dean, Reginald FA. \\"Treatment of kwashiorkor with moderate amounts of protein.\\" The Journal of Pediatrics 56.5 (1960): 675-689.Davies, J. N. P. \\"Nutrition and nutritional diseases.\\" Annual review of medicine 3.1 (1952): 99-132. The mortality-rates, especially among infants and children, were disturbingly high. In 1960, based on his prior successful campaigns against epidemic disease outbreaks, the colonial authorities tasked him with formulating a roadmap to guide and coordinate the interdisciplinary and interagency crisis- management team to deal with kwashiorkor crisis. Using available data, he unpretentiously focused on the Kikuyu ethnic group, one of the localities where the disease was endemic. Yet again, the Kikuyu campaign was utterly successful. The lessons learnt from the Kikuyu campaign gave impetus to an effective regional strategy. One of the key elements of the program was the national school milk program which provided daily provision of milk to kindergarten through preparatory school children during morning and afternoon recess sessions; moreover, educators were mandated to somatically check pupils for health and hygiene during physical education (PE) periods; further, schools were duty-bound to maintain up-to-date requisite immunization records. Indeed, this was one of the constituents of a multi-part dynamic public health strategy—which had been explicitly adapted by the East African Commission—toward health wellness; thus, socioeconomic, sociocultural, and socioecological progressions in the region.Inopportunely, postcolonial Kenyan authorities failed to adequately embrace the value of intellectual property, which brought about a lack of an effective information management strategy; thus, a loss of precious apolitical knowledge—such as medical science—or critical programs and infrastructures. This has a knowledge chasm. The Kenya school milk program is a classic example of the \\"reinventing the wheel\\" cliché. Per Bwibo et. al., The Journal of Nutrition 133.11 (2003): 3936S-3940S, the program was started in 1982 by the president of the Republic of Kenya. Au contraire, in 1960 the school milk program had been implemented in Kenya and Uganda by the du jour government administration pursuant to Dr. BV Oriedo’s strategy to stem the kwashiorkor disease. Moreover, the program was a constituent of a multi-part dynamic public health strategy which he helped to spearhead. = Plasmodium falciparum malaria epidemics campaign = During the late 1950s and 1960s (prior to his inexplicable death in 1966) he championed, coordinated, and buoyed the campaign against malaria amongst Africans and Asiatics communities in East Africa where the disease epidemics was poignantly endemic and had exacted a heavy mortality toll. Those communities, especially the native African tribes were mostly remote and in disadvantaged settings. Preceding his efforts, those communities had received, at best, spasmodic attention from the colonial regime.Roberts, J. M. D., et al. \\"Onchocerciasis in Kenya 9, 11 and 18 years after elimination of the vector.\\" Bulletin of the World Health Organization 37.2 (1967): 195. For instance, the 1961 heavy rainfall brought flooding and the rise of the outbreaks of malaria epidemics that extended deeply into the hinterland. He was a major force behind the resourcefulness in formulating and implementing an extensive public health control program; elements of the program entailed leveraging-in successful aspects from the Nairobi campaign of 1940 epidemic, scouting and mapping out the breeding sites, conducting entomological and epidemiological studies, oiling and larviciding of stagnant waters and bushes, and mass chemoprophylaxis administration.WHO Report on Malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa 1900 - 1990 The approach succeeded in containing malaria epidemics in several remote and disadvantaged settings amongst Africans and Asiatics communities.These approaches had previously been successfully used in the 1940s in NairobiMudhune, Sandra A., et al. \\"The clinical burden of malaria in Nairobi: a historical review and contemporary audit.\\" Malaria journal 10.1 (2011): 1.Hay, S., et al. \\"Clinical epidemiology of malaria in the highlands of western Kenya.\\" Emerging infectious diseases 8.6 (2002). = Situational, tactical, operational, and strategical national health system = He was an unbendable crusader of an important performance indexed healthcare quality improvement programThe plan was unpretentious. The primary objective was to improve health wellness (The absence of disease or infirmity—optimal physical and mental well-being—stemming adverse socioeconomic, sociocultural and socio- ecological consequences of disease.) and intellectual & civic infrastructure standards across the Eastern Africa region. One of the chief provisos focused on pupils from daycare through college. Every single pupil was required to participate in health and fitness education programs. School officials were tasked with implementing and sustaining pertinent performance indexed programs which included maintaining each pupil’s health and hygiene records that included weekly hygiene, nutritional, and fitness assessments. Thus, school officials were tasked with compliance, whereas public health officials were tasked with formulation, implementation, and enforcement. which raised immunization coverage levels of inoculation preventable diseases by lessening missed opportunities to vaccinate, vigilant administration of accountability requirements, and the overall improved standards of practices for health wellness and fitness, at all levels, in the Eastern Africa region. In 1960 he was one of the key architects of a dynamical interdisciplinary multicomponent and multigenerational public health, a healthcare and hygiene strategy of long-term planning based on the application of preventative modalities that helped shift the medical science paradigm—in East Africa—away from the undue emphasis on curative means, and more so towards a balanced approach; that which seeks to adapt public health strategies that effectively integrates epidemiological, parasitological, and etiological knowledge with tactical and situational curative approaches.The desired key outcomes included the prevention of disease or infectious agents, disability, malnutrition, and mortality rate—especially among the vulnerable populations of children, youth, and young adults—by means of immunization, hygiene, nutrition (e.g., providing free fluid whole milk for school children as part of his campaign against kwashiorkor epidemic outbreaks), and dietary supplement with multivitamins, and by control of contagious, parasitic and related diseases. The antecedent healthcare and hygiene strategy received the commendation of the British colonial East African High Commission and the British Colonial Medical Services in London; the strategy was adapted by the commission and Kenya's Ministry of Health and Housing. The program forms the organizational rudiments of the present healthcare and hygiene strategy in East Africa.The Kenya Colony and Protectorate, Annual Medical Report, 1960, Nairobi, Government Printer, 1961.Annual Report of the Colonies, Kenya, 1961 Dr. BV Oriedo, in person, conducted surprise compliance audits across mostly remote regions of Kenya and Uganda—he wrote meticulously cogent observations outlining his findings and recommendations for corrective measures, and a timeline for full compliance. In cases of systemic failures, he was known to summarily discharge the absconding individual(s). = An epidemiological perspective to economic consequences of disease = A frontier statesman and a scientist he developed an interdisciplinarity pioneering approach that connected the struggle for political freedom in Kenya with fully integrated healthcare, intellectual, socioeconomic, and civil infrastructures; especially in the rural regions that bore the brunt of disease epidemics and its dire socioeconomic and sociocultural consequences. Antecedently, he embraced a revolutionary du jour epidemiological perspective towards the economic and intellectual consequences of disease or public health strategy across the East African region. Indeed, he understood that a viable independent Kenya would require not only a cadre of well-educated native professionals but also inevitably a sustainable robust and dynamic local healthcare and intellectual infrastructures able to fuel and drive a sustainable economic development, hence an equitable holistic wellness of all her peoples. To this effect, he ardently lobbied—albeit unsuccessfully—to adapt health care as an expressly stipulated right endowed under the new constitution of the nascent postcolonial Kenya. This prescient interdisciplinary consummate statesmanship made him distinct from the effusive political cadre of his contemporaries that are prominently chronicled with Kenya's freedom struggle. = Regulating native African ethno-medicinal practices = Throughout his career, he sought to regulate, through explication and behavioral modification, the passé pluralistic medicine and mysticism that had remained a central sociocultural institution across East Africa.Abdullahi, Ali Arazeem. \\"Trends and Challenges of Traditional Medicine in Africa.\\" African Journal of Traditional, Complementary, and Alternative Medicines 8.5 Suppl (2011): 115–123. Antecedently, he was an austere vocal critic of indigenous practices that placed the wellbeing of native communities in peril and easy prey to the quackery of guileful practitioners—he worked towards getting those charlatanism practices extirpated. Moreover, he advocated for regulating native ethno-medicinal practices and outlawing those that were insanitary or insalubrious through erudition programs tailored to specific native communities’ socioculturalism. Congruently, he encouraged a scientific approach to traditional medicinal modalities, vis-à-vis, enacting of quality control criteria such as dosage guidelines in conjunction with promoting proven evidence-based time-tested and outcome-driven ethno-medicine. He presciently cognized that this could only be achieved through colorable scientifically modeled studies to authenticate the safety and efficacies of indigenous healing methods akin to the European or westernized medicine. To accomplish the antecedent initiative, he recommended founding an ethnomedicine advisory board, at the national and provincial levels, under the auspices of the Ministry of Health and Housing; a board whose composition would include traditional healers and modern healthcare practitioners. Regrettably, his precipitously inexplicable death led to the demise of the initiative; as it lacked a natural vigilant and persuasive sponsor of his acumen and stature.  Medical Scientific Research  He was a consummate medical scientific researcher and an intellectual. He was motivated by a quest for perfectionism, and dedication to his profession and those whom he served; a scholarly and fastidious scientific researcher and medical epidemiological and parasitological practitioner. His research thesis was in the field of tropical medicine's parasitological epidemiology of infectious diseases or agents. Indeed, he is known for his contributions to tropical medicine via a myriad of practical field campaigns against a range of disease epidemics in East and Central Africa, and the Sudan. His most notable contribution to tropical medicine stems from the studies and fieldwork in the epidemiology of East African leishmaniasis. He amassed aplenty informative medical studies, clinical and field observations data, and his analyses and postulations in the medical disciplines of tropical medicine and hygiene. Moreover, he embraced the peer review scholarly processes and made full use of it. In the 1950s he called for and helped champion, with the backing of Sir Manson-Bahr and B.A. Southgate, for the creation of an official peer-reviewed comprehensive healthcare reference database for East Africa akin of the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Similarly, he ardently championed for a creation of a robust and dynamic healthcare infrastructure in the rural regions —a “National Reference Health Centre for Kenya”. In 1953 and ‘54, he was an invited panelist at the East Africa High Commission Scientific Conference. The conference which was under the aegis of the London based Colonial Office of United Kingdom was an exclusive citadel for the European research expatriates. On 11 January 1961, an abstract of the first series of his pioneering epidemiological medical studies of the East African Leishmaniasis (kala-azar) was presented before the East Africa High Commission Scientific Conference on \\"The Epidemiology of Arthropod-borne Diseases\\", at Nairobi. The work was very well received, and has enjoyed sweeping application and has been widely cited, across the globe.Bettini, S., S. Pampiglione, and M.

He was a panelist at a Rural Health Conference of the South Pacific Commission, Tahiti, April 1963. All things considered, his achievements are utterly remarkable for two main reasons. Firstly, these epic feats could be attained by one so young and within a very short amount of time—prior to his precipitous death at age 34; secondly, these feats occurred during the epoch of colonialism at which time Africans—especially in professional scientific fields—were relegated to servitude roles and faced perpetual subordination.It’s worth noting that scholarly publication was an enduring grievance for African medical or scientific researchers (i.e., a very small number, predominantly physicians, du jour in the entire East and Central African region). Whites arrogated unadulterated credit and published under their own names research often pioneered and conducted by these African scientific avant-gardists. African scientific or medical researchers, and medical professionals were relegated to servitude roles and faced perpetual subordination, whites considered themselves superior whatever their rank or intellectual capacity. In 1964 he was a recipient of a coveted medical research grant furnished by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH), Extramural Research Program. The grant was in support of his pioneering epidemiological, parasitological, and etiological research—field and clinical research and development in the spread, control, and eradication of infectious agents—in Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases in East Africa. Albeit a life short-lived, his pioneering work has received global acclaim and application. = Studies in the Epidemiological and Parasitological of East African Leishmaniasis = His Epidemiological and Parasitological Studies of East Africa Leishmaniasis led to the chivalrous stemming of October 1952 visceral leishmaniasis epidemic outbreak in Kenya—a British colony du jour. In 1952 he stoically, in a profound demonstration of his commitment to the human cause of the lives of indigenous peoples,(ii) relocated to the remote hinterland outpost District Hospital and Public Health Office at Kitui in Kenya—moving to the fore personally—to spearhead a hands-on crusade against a major kala-azar epidemic outbreak in October 1952. Kala-azar (black fever) or visceral leishmaniasis is a deadly parasitic disease endemic to the tropics, subtropics, and southern Europe. The disease was first diagnosed in the Kitui region of the British colony of Kenya du jour in 1946.(iii)(iv) The Kitui epidemic was a portentously existential peril to thousands of indigenous lives; it threatened to wipe out entire ethnic Kamba villages. He devised a savvy strategy to stem the tide of the epidemic and managed to save thousands of lives. In 1954 the disease was arrested. Albeit the stemming the tide of the Kitui kala-azar epidemic in 1954 and afterward in other regions of the Kenyan colony, a plethora of epidemiological questions remained unanswered; moreover, the disease was still gnawingly ubiquitous in numerous other regions of East Africa and the Sudan. Thus, with the keen encouragement and support of Sir P. E. C. Manson-Bahr and Dr. B. A. Southgate, a Briton and his research associate and close friend, he proposed a collaborative approach—between himself and Dr. B. A. Southgate, and two other researchers at the Medical Research Laboratory's Division of Insect-borne Diseases at Nairobi—to perform in-depth medical epidemiological and parasitological studies of visceral leishmaniasis in East and Central Africa, and the Sudan. The collaboration became the impetus of his concurrently synchronous kala-azar epidemiological vocation and dissertational research studies at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in the Great Britain. His sponsors and main contributing entities to this novel work were the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Sir Philip Henry Manson-Bahr; East African High Commission's East Africa Bureau of Research in Medicine and Hygiene; the British Colonial Medical Services at London; Ministry of Health and Housing, Kenya; the Division of Insect-borne Diseases, Medical Research Laboratory, Nairobi; and Tulane University's Medical College's School of Tropical and Infectious Diseases in the United States. His astute epidemiological and parasitological medical research and field observations of visceral leishmaniasis in East and Central Africa, and the Sudan revealed that under ceteris paribus male and female populations exposed to the disease experience different symptoms or sometimes no symptoms; further, the seropositivity rate was higher in females than the males; whereas, using the leishmanin skin test, higher prevalence in males has been recorded. His observations played a major role in the elucidation of the multi-etiological factors in the gestation of the disease; the delineation of which, is of the essence in precluding the misclassification of the induction and latent phases of the disease or infectious agents. Another key elucidation based on his work is that infected people are not needed to maintain the natural transmission cycle of the leishmania protozoan parasite; viz., the natural transmission cycle is sustainable by means of animal reservoir hosts along with sandflies. These findings helped pave the way for a more effective characterization of the incubation process of the disease through a more erudite complex multifarious modern epidemiological and parasitological approaches. This work has been widely cited and the complex multifarious approach widely applied.[24]  Statesmanship = Statesmanship  He was quasi-antithetical to donning sumptuous political office; thus, despite incessant lobbying by his fellow countrymen in the political cadre—among them his confidante Tom Mboya—who were au courant with his intuitively superb oratory, articulatory, charisma, and leadership (situational, tactical, and strategic and transformational) skills, coupled with his acuity for local and international geopolitical affairs that were congruent with their perceived needs of Kenya's liberation movement. Albeit a caritas assent for politics per se, he espoused differing strategic considerations and philosophical approaches, vis-à-vis Kenya's liberation initiative; he gave precedence to the activism of healthcare, socioeconomic, and intellectual infrastructure needs of the region. In a communiqué to his confidante Tom Mboya, he cautioned the nascent Kenyan political cadre of the liberation movement against a gullibility towards an impetuous independency—opining that such impetuous move, meagerly developed civil institutions, could lead to vassalage statehood and a vacuous independence, unless wholesome tactical and strategic civil institution infrastructures were in place to remedy the situation at the time of independence. He argued that Africans du jour had yet to achieve sufficient critical-to-success intellectual, healthcare, and socioeconomic resources and infrastructures for a comprehensive wholesome liberation—a truly Africanized self-governance. Whilst spearheading campaigns against a myriad of disease epidemics and parasitological epidemiology research—in the rustic and urbanite regions across East and Central Africa—he'd come face-to-face with the abominable high rates of poverty among the native populations and the ensuing undue repugnant healthcare and hygiene woes borne by those communities. This shattering firsthand experience led him to explicate that excessive emphasis was being placed on political fulcrum at the detriment of critical socioeconomic, healthcare, and intellectual infrastructural rudiments. This experience caused him to ardently use his skills and influence crusading for the latter, while engaging peripherally in the former. He cognized health care as a basic human right long before the 1978 Alma Ata Declaration proclamation. This cognizance is evident in his intrepid and transformative role in East Africa's healthcare, socioeconomic, and intellectual infrastructures. His precipitously inexplicable death in the springtime of life at age 34, robbed these causes an ardently eloquent advocate and consummate statesman.  Legacy of Good Citizenship and Social Conscience  He was a staunch adversary of maladroitness and the abuse of public trust; utterly stubborn—an uncompromising scrupulous—and demonstrative disdain for and impatient towards ineptitude. He was an outspoken critic of vice by those in power; thus, his policies became anathema to the vestiges of colonial Kenya, and most postcolonial bureaucrats and political elites of the embryonic independent Kenya. Proof positive, in 1965, upon his return from a conference in the Netherlands and other official engagement in Europe, he summarily terminated employment of several expatriates and native personnel for graft, ineptitude, and absconding from duty. His actions albeit justifiably de jure met with ad hominem assails from a cadre of bureaucrats and political elites; nevertheless, he stood his ground and refused to be intimidated into rescinding the edicts. In his point of view these individuals’ embrace of public service was solely a means to an end; such that theirs was a dichotomous embodiment of a pernicious approach to public interest.  Patron of Academics  Apart from Dr. BV Oriedo's venerable contribution to the healthcare system in the East and Central Africa region, du jour, he was an indubitable patron of higher education and a boon to the impetus of intellectual infrastructure in the nascent postcolonial East Africa. In the late 1950s (and thereafter) he was a silent force behind the fostering of indispensable rapports with likeminded contemporaries abroad that led to the inception of higher education opportunities in North America for talented East African students. It's worth noting that during the colonial and embryonic postcolonial East Africa, higher education (college and university) opportunities, both the quality and quantity, were severely inadequate for the native African students. Thus, the antecedent initiative was part of his abiding furtherance of a robustly dynamic intellectual infrastructure in the countries of the eastern and central African region, du jour, via a strategy of multipartite cross-functional partnerships abroad. The higher education initiative (concept of opportunities in North America) resonated very well with his confidante and compatriot, Thomas Joseph Odhiambo \\"Tom\\" Mboya (d. July 1969)—a dynamic and compelling political figure in Kenya's liberation movement. The two friends were utterly indispensable in their combined efforts; moreover, they teamed up with other key protagonists, locally and abroad, to champion the program as a key policy initiative. Some of these key partners included John F. Kennedy (a U.S. president, who was then a senator), William X. Scheinman (businessman), Jackie Robinson (former baseball star), Harry Belafonte (singer and actor), and Sidney Poitier (actor); William X. Scheinman is undoubtedly the pillar that buttressed the campaign, and the engine and fuel that sustained the process—a man to whom Kenya owes a great debt.[25] Tom Mboya played a key role in securing air transportation to North America, in September 1959, for the initial eighty-one students with scholarship in the United States and Canada; whereas, Dr. BV Oriedo was an esoteric boon of the concept and the scholarship initiative—including directing and advising Tom Mboya accordingly.[8][26] Thereafter, Mboya would become the dominant political face of this laudable and unquestionably successful initiative.[8] Perhaps the crowning achievement of the initiative was the 1959 founding of the African American Students Foundation (AASF), which further obtained hundreds of new scholarships in North America for students from the East African countries. In addition, the AASF raised funds for airfare and living expenses for the scholarship recipients.[27] Moreover, the AASF, with the facilitation of John F. Kennedy, secured a contribution of $200,000 from Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. Foundation that entailed the entire amount needed for the 1960–61 academic year airlift, and the assisting of students with basic living expenses in the United States.[28] In this regard, it can be argued that Dr. BV Oriedo is an embodiment of the epic odyssey of Kenya's (Africa's) unheralded protagonists. On the other hand, he was a performance-driven pragmatist with a focus on the salient outcome.  Relationships  Dr. BV Oriedo was an accomplished and charismatic figure, who possessed an innate capacity to cultivate an interdisciplinary network of far- reaching and ecumenical professional and proletarian relationships that transcended race, and across geographies. For instance, albeit not having attended Makerere Medical School at Mengo in Uganda, as early as 1950 he enjoyed piquant professional and social kindred with a cadre of Makerere medical community[29]—which consisted of Africans, Indians, Arabs, and whites. Consonant with his fêted cerebral abilities, he was a trendsetter and socialite. He boasted a charismatic persona, splendid nobility, and clairvoyant interlocution with a quick wit to boot. A cadre of diverse and multidisciplinary contemporaries (Africans, Indo-Asiatics, Caucasians, Arabs, etc.) from across East Africa flocked to his residence to indulge in social intercourse—interchange of ideals and ideas, entertainment, debate local and international affairs and geopolitics du jour. He was known to his contemporaries as \\"Jaraha\\"—a hybrid Kiswahili-Dhuluo idiom for \\"en vogue socialite\\" or the \\"cosmopolitan\\"! His camaraderie was quite encompassing. It included some of the most accomplished scientists, politicians, civil servants, academicians, businessmen/merchants, administrators, and a plethora of common people du jour. The list included such international luminaries as Sir Philip Edmund Clinton Manson-Bahr (d. 1966)—the son-in-law of Sir Patrick Mason, the doyen founder of the field of tropical medicine, Tom Mboya—Cabinet Minister who was also a very close confidante, Professor Hillary Ojiambo—Kenyan Chief Cardiologist & the late President Jomo Kenyatta's personal physician, Masinde Muliro—Cabinet Minister, Charles Njonjo—Kenyan's Attorney General during Jomo Kenyatta’ presidency; Kitili Maluki Mwendwa—1st African Chief Justice of Kenya; Dr. BA Southgate—Research Scientist & Medical Physician, Paul Ngei—Cabinet Minister; Dr. Apollo Milton Obote—led Uganda to independence from Britain in 1962, becoming Prime Minister and the President twice; Fred Kubai—Cabinet Minister, Achieng Oneko—Cabinet Minister; Andrew Omanga Cabinet Minister; Joseph Otiende—Cabinet Minister; Elijah Mwangale—Cabinet Minister; Dr. Julius Gikonyo Kiano—Cabinet Minister; Dr. R.

As Big Mama is running late for her night shift Buggy helps her look for shoes and a packed box falls open. Clothing tumbles out and Big Mama addresses them as prostitute clothes. Cookie goes to look at the items and Big Mama tells her not to go through a dead woman's things. Buggy identifies the fallen items as his mother's. Cookie is walking through the unit quietly, as not to wake up Buggy asleep on the couch, trying to change her sheets after she wet the bed. Gunshots go off and Buggy wakes up panicked calling out for his mom. He asks Cookie to hand him his bag and he takes out a bottle of pills which he can't open, so Cookie opens it.

It becomes clear that Buggy sold drugs in the past and tells Big MaMa their only option may be for him to sell for Tony C. Buggy and Cornbread are making crack in Cornbread's apartment. They talk while they work and Cornbread suggests selling in Tony C's areas which could be dangerous. Buggy says he'll help Cornbread sell, but this is the final time. Cornbread talks of creating a drug empire with Buggy as his partner. As they continue to work Buggy thanks Cornbread for looking after Cookie while he was away. The conversation evolves and they talk about their past selling drugs together. Buggy starts talking to Cornbread about the war. He confesses while he is able to block out some incidents in battle he can't forget what happened to his mother. When he was eight years old Tony C broke into their home and his mother was violently gang-raped. After that, she started using cocaine. While Buggy blames himself for his mother's death he holds Tony C responsible. Crank is cutting Cornbread's hair in his unit while Toyia is out. Cornbread puts his head to Crank's stomach and asks how long it will be. Crank tells Cornbread he won't be around by the time the baby comes because he is moving to Mississippi. Crank says she's not sure if the baby is his, he asks who else she's been with and she turns the question to him referencing Toyia. He reminds Crank that was the deal but that he needs Crank and wants to be there for her. Crank says Toyia knows about them which Cornbread doesn't believe at first. He tries to kiss Crank. She resists and he makes a comment that he's not good enough for her because he's not Buggy. Toyia walks in on them and there is a large confrontation.

They start to talk and as Skillet prepares to say goodbye to Cookie he kisses her. Buggy and Cornbread are playing a video game with toy guns in Cornbread's apartment. They begin to talk about killing Tony C and Buggy teaches Cornbread how to shoot. He starts to talk violently of his time in service making Cornbread uncomfortable. Big Mama's getting ready to leave for work while Buggy gives her a roll of cash. She tells him they won't always have to rely on him selling drugs. They begin to talk about Tiffany, her involvement with drugs, and her death. Big Mama gives the money back to Buggy. Buggy becomes emotional and tells Big Mama it's her fault Tiffany died and Big Mama hits him. He tries to get her to take the money back but she leaves. Cornbread and Buggy are outside waiting for someone. Ebony runs over with Tony C and begins to vomit. Tony C is criticizing Ebony for how he handled his gun and got blood on Tony C's shoes. Buggy asks where Skillet is and Tony C responds saying he knows about their business selling drugs on his territory. Ebony tells them Skillet is dead. Tony C says he wants the money Cornbread and Buggy made selling on his territory. Buggy strangles Tony C close to death. Eventually, he lets go and Cornbread, Buggy, and Ebony run away leaving Tony C by himself as the police come. Toyia forcefully knocks on the door to Big Mama's apartment. Crank lets her in and Toyia says Cornbread is in jail and she needs to bail him out. She explains that Skillet is dead and there was a confrontation with Tony C. Cornbread got arrested with drugs on him. Toyia asks Crank to hold the rest of the drugs while she figures out what to do. She's scared Tony C is going to search through her apartment or come after her and her baby. Crank refuses to take the drugs but ends up holding it. Crank is alone in the apartment watching the news. She becomes overwhelmed and smokes the product Toyia left with her. Buggy is in the apartment as Crank and Cookie enter fighting. Cookie would not say the pledge of allegiance in class and Crank begins to threaten to beat her. Buggy intervenes trying to protect Cookie. Crank grabs an extension cord and as she grabbing Cookie's clothes they see a bloodstain on the back of her skirt. Cookie leaves and Buggy confronts Crank for smoking crack again. Crank reprimands Buggy for being absent from Cookie's life but ends up asking him to take Cookie. Buggy says he is sick and has to leave. Cookie is sitting outside of the apartment. Buggy comes to join her and teaches her how babies are conceived.

On his few recordings, released from 1929 to 1937, he was accompanied by Roosevelt Sykes, Lonnie Johnson and others. His most notable song was one he wrote, \\"Groceries on the Shelf (Piggly Wiggly)\\", which he recorded in Grafton, Wisconsin, about February 1930. There is little information about his life outside of his recordings. Biography Pertum was born in Quincy, Adams County, Illinois. He was the son of Maggie Pertum. He used Charles \\"Speck\\" Pertum as his name on a couple of his earliest recordings, and also used the nickname \\"Black Patch\\", both nicknames referring to his reported \\"weak eyes\\". On most of his recordings he used his stepfather's name, McFadden. McFadden moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1921. He was considered to be one of the top blues singers in the city. He made his first recordings in 1929. He made friends with the blues pianist Roosevelt Sykes, who played on twelve of the twenty tracks that have been preserved. McFadden's most notable number was \\"Groceries on the Shelf (Piggly Wiggly)\\". He wrote the song and recorded three separate versions of it. A cover version of the song was recorded by Lucille Bogan. (Piggly Wiggly is the name of a supermarket chain operating in the Southern and Midwestern regions of the United States, which first opened in 1916.) Another of his tracks was \\"Gambler's Blues\\", the title of which he may have been well versed to expound. McFadden was arrested on 13 separate occasions between 1929 and 1935, with ten of those charges being for gambling. Little is known of his life apart from this.

He founded Yeshivat Aderet Eliyahu, part of a community that follows the path of the Vilna Gaon.  Early life  Yitzchok Shlomo Zilberman was born in Berlin, Germany to Rabbi Dr. Avraham Moshe Zilberman, translator of the Tanakh into German, and Rivka, née Levy. His mother died when he was 3 years old, and he was raised by his father.\\"Rav Yitzchok Shlomo Zilberman: The Zilberman Derech -Charting a New-Old Path\\", The Jewish Eye In 1934, in response to the coming to power of Adolf Hitler, Zilberman escaped with his father, brother, and sister to England. In 1939, after his father died, Zilberman caught the last boat leaving England for Palestine before the war halted sea traffic, and he made aliyah. He went to live with his uncle Yaakov Levy in Rehavia, Jerusalem, the director of the labor ward at Bikur Cholim Hospital. He studied at the Horev Yeshiva, and continued his education at Kol Torah under the watchful eye of Rabbi Dr. Yechiel Michel Schlesinger. He later went on to study in the Mir Yeshiva. Lacking the guidance of a father figure, Zilberman struggled in his youth to find an appropriate spiritual path within Orthodox Judaism to which he could relate. He first experimented with Hasidic Judaism, in particular Chabad and Breslov, before eventually adopting the stance of the Perushim of the Sha'arei Hesed neighbourhood, followers of the Vilna Gaon.  Educator  Zilberman began his teaching career as a tester at Kolel Shomrei HaChomos. In the 1960s, he was instrumental in founding the Kaminetz and Hadar Zion Talmud Torahs, but his maverick teaching style caused him difficulties, which ultimately led to a parting of ways with those institutions. During this time, Zilberman became active as a sofer, in order to avoid deriving benefit from Torah scholarship.  Zilberman Method  In the beginning of the 1980s, after having had limited success with incorporating his teaching style in existing institutions, Zilberman founded, with the help of his sons, Yeshivat Aderet Eliyahu, in the northern part of the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem. The school, also known as \\"Zilberman's Cheder\\", adopted its founder's method, and became an inspiration for many of his students, who later branched out all over the country founding schools with the same teaching approach. The Zilberman Method was not a new innovation, but rather a return to an ancient form of Torah study elucidated in the Mishna and Talmud, and favoured by both the Maharal and the Vilna Gaon. In Pirkei Avos 5 it states, \\"A 5-year-old [learns] the Torah, a ten-year old [learns] the Mishna, a 15-year-old [learns] the Talmud.\\" In Shabbat 63a it states, \\"A man should recite, and only later expound.\\" This is in contrast to standard procedure in the Torah world, where intense scrutiny of the text at a relatively young age is favoured over the covering and committing to memory of vast amounts of material. Zilberman also instituted that school sessions be continued on Shabbat and Jewish holidays, albeit at a reduced schedule. Zilberman's life work was favoured by Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and the Tchebiner Rav. Zilberman kept the practice of donning his tefilin all day, and so encouraged his students. In normative practice, the tefilin are removed after Shacharit. Zilberman was one of the first rabbis to promote the usage of tekhelet, and encouraged his students and family to make use of the dye in their tzitzit.Meyers Epstein, Varda (3 January 2014) \\"Tekhelet: A Choice or an Imperative?\\", The Jewish Press He encouraged his students to get married young, based upon a teaching in Pirkei Avot Chapter 5.  Family  Zilberman's eldest son, Yom Tov Zilberman Zilberman married Sheindel, the daughter of Yom Tov Zlotnick of Jerusalem, who bore him 9 sons and 9 daughters. All of his sons and sons-in-law are involved in Torah education. Zilberman's daughter Rachel Weiss and her three sons were killed in the Jericho bus firebombing. In 1991, Zilberman moved to the Jewish Quarter, to be in close proximity to his institutions. One year later, his wife died. He remarried in 1998. Zilberman died in 2001 after contracting an illness. He was buried in the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery.  Legacy  Zilberman's grave in the Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery There are approximately 20 Torah institutions throughout Israel that adhere to Zilberman's teaching principles, and 3 internationally. Zilberman was the rabbi who influenced Israeli comedian Uri Zohar to become a baal teshuva (returnee to Judaism). Zohar would go on to have an enormous impact on a generation of spiritually ambivalent Israeli Jews.Lev, Hayim (17 September 2015) מעולם הזהר אל הזהר הקדוש\\", Arutz Sheva\\" Another student, Yitzhak Pindros, is a politician affiliated with the United Torah Judaism party.

Their name is a reference to a song by Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros on their 2003 album Streetcore. Since their founding in 2007, the band has released two LPs, two EPs, one live album, and four split singles. They have appeared on stage with notable groups such as Teenage Bottlerocket, The Falcon, Dillinger Four, and NOFX. Arms Aloft have appeared at festivals including The War on X-Mas, The Gilead Media Music Festival, The Fest, and Manchester Punk Festival.  Music  Arms Aloft are described as belonging to the tradition of melodic hardcore bands like Jawbreaker, Hot Water Music, None More Black, and The Menzingers. As described by frontman Seth Gile, the band's lyrics frequently focus on left politics and how they affect people personally. Their music accordingly has covered explicitly political topics such as pollution, global warming, Wall Street corruption, and drone strikes, as well as time-honored topics such as breakups and boredom.  History  The band's original lineup emerged from the Eau Claire high school music scene that produced members of bands like Bon Iver and Laarks. In an interview, Gile recalls his first ever public performance as a musician came at a high school battle of the bands showcase that also featured Justin Vernon of Bon Iver as well as future members of Gayngs and Megafaun. In the mid-2000s the band formed, and had self-recorded and released a demo EP by mid-2007. The demo was also released as a set of free MP3's that were praised by one reviewer as \\" potent, gravelly and melodic.\\" In 2008, Dead Format Records released the band's debut 7-inch EP, Comfort at Any Cost. Brian Shultz of Punknews called it \\"surprisingly poetic\\" in a generally positive review. After releasing a split EP with The Manix and The Fake Boys, and adding Jack Gribble to the lineup after former drummer Zach Holder moved out of the area, Arms Aloft released their first album, Sawdust City. It was recorded at Nicollet Recording Studio in Minneapolis with Dustin Miller, and released a year later on Kiss of Death Records. The release was followed up by a 53 day promotional tour. The album title was a reference to a nickname for their home town, Eau Claire -- as explained by frontman Seth Gile, the \\"desolate\\" name reflected the band's \\"weird pride in our pessimism\\" and love of their Eau Claire that's reflected in their lyrics. The album was released to positive reviews, receiving 4.5/5 stars from Punknews.org, who called it \\"the best punk record I've heard all year\\". A live record, recorded at Gilead Music Festival, followed in 2014. Their follow-up LP, What a Time to Be Barely Alive, was released by Red Scare Industries in 2016. It was similarly enthusiastically reviewed, receiving 4/5 stars from Punknews.org and 4.5/5 stars from Dying Scene. Scene Point Blank called the record \\"carefully structured with rising and falling power within each song\\". and the Milwaukee Record called it \\"a potent 12-pack of socially-aimed rally cries that tote an overriding sense of cynicism.\\" The band toured Europe in early 2019 with French punk band Guerilla Poubelle.

There are three subspecies, commonly known as silver mallee or Southern Cross mallee, (subspecies crucis), narrow-leaved silver mallee, (subsp. lanceolata) and Paynes Find mallee, (subsp. praecipua). It has rough bark that is shed in curling flakes, more or less round, glaucous juvenile leaves, egg-shaped intermediate leaves and lance-shaped adult leaves. The type of bark and the proportion of juvenile, intermediate and adult leaves in the crown of mature plants varies with subspecies. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils, the flowers are whitish to pale yellow and the fruit is a conical to hemispherical capsule.flower buds and flowersfruit\\"minni ritchi\\" bark Description Eucalyptus crucis is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rich, reddish brown, fibrous bark that in several subspecies is shed in curling \\"minni ritchi\\" patches about wide. Young plants, coppice regrowth, and sometimes the crown of mature trees have sessile, usually glaucous, more or less round leaves arranged in opposite pairs, long and wide. Intermediate leaves are arranged more or less in opposite pairs or alternately, egg-shaped to lance-shaped, up to long and wide with a short petiole. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are more or less oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum long. Flowering occurs between September and March and the fruit is a woody cup-shaped to hemispherical capsule long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus crucis was first formally described in 1923 by Joseph Maiden from a specimen collected near Southern Cross by Henry Steedman in 1922. Maiden published the description in his book A Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus. The specific epithet (crucis) is a Latin word meaning \\"cross\\", referring to the type location. In 1982, Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper described two subspecies, crucis and lanceolata, and in 1993 they described subspecies praecipua. The three subspecies have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census. * Eucalyptus crucis subsp. crucis has a crown composed of glaucous juvenile leaves; * Eucalyptus crucis subsp. lanceolata has a crown of greyish green adult leaves; * Eucalyptus crucis subsp. praecipua has a crown of adult leaves but they are larger than in subspecies lanceolata and the bark is only the \\"minni ritchi\\" type on the thinner branches. Distribution and habitat Silver mallee is found in an area in the Goldfields-Esperance and Wheatbelt region of Western Australia where it grows in sandy, clay or loam soils amongst granite outcrops. It is associated with sheoak (Allocasuarina species), wattle (Acacia species) and one-sided bottlebrush (Calothamnus species). Subspecies crucis is only found between Merredin, Southern Cross and Westonia, subspecies lanceolata between Corrigin, Mount Churchman and Chiddarcooping Rock. Subspecies praecipua is only known from near Paynes Find. Conservation status Subspecies lanceolata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" but subspecies crucis and praecipua are classified as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora — Extant)\\" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia). Subspecies crucis (silver mallee) is also listed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The main threats to this subspecies are recreational activities, pipeline maintenance, grazing and weed invasion. Use in horticulture This eucalypt is frost and drought tolerant and is suitable for alkaline soils. It is commonly used as a windbreak, a street tree, for its decorative fruit, for erosion control, and as a honey producing or bird nesting plant.
