Although the name Kaimon translates to \\"sea gate\\", the ship was named for Mount Kaimon, although written with different kanji, located in Kagoshima prefecture. Background Kaimon was a three-masted bark-rigged sloop-of-war with a coal-fired double expansion reciprocating steam engine with four boilers driving a single screw.Chesneau, All the World‚Äôs Fighting Ships, p. 232. She was laid down at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 1 September 1877, launched on 28 August 1882 and commissioned on 13 March 1884.Nishida, Ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy Her construction required over six years, due to numerous technical issues and problems with funding. The design of Kaimon was almost identical to the corvette , completed a year later at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. Both ships were designed by French foreign advisors to the early Meiji government in the employ of the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. During her launching ceremony, a flock of white doves (the traditional messengers of the war god Hachiman) was released, setting a precedent for all future launchings of Japanese warships. Her first captain was Lieutenant Commander Tsuboi K≈çz≈ç. Operational history Kaimon saw combat service in the First Sino-Japanese War, at the landings of Japanese forces at Chemulpo in Korea, and subsequently at the Battle of Yalu River under the command of Lieutenant Commander Sakurai Kikunozo. She also served with the Japanese task force that supported the invasion of Taiwan in 1895. On 21 March 1898, Kaimon was re-designated as a third-class coastal defense ship, and was used for coastal survey and patrol duties. During the Russo-Japanese War, Kaimon was assigned to patrol duties between the Korean Peninsula and Tsushima Strait. She was also used as a transport. She struck a naval mine on 5 July 1904, off Port Arthur (), and sunk with the loss of her captain and 22 crewmen. She was struck from the navy list on 21 May 1905.

It formerly resided in a 16 MB file system. However, starting with the NXE Update, more storage became a requirement, rectified by either having a Hard Drive installed, or one of the later revisions of the console with adequate flash storage embedded within the console. The system software has access to a maximum of 32 MB of the system's Random Access Memory. The updates can be downloaded from the Xbox Live service directly to the Xbox 360 and subsequently installed. Microsoft has also provided the ability to download system software updates from their respective official Xbox website to their PCs and then storage media, from which the update can be installed to the system. The Xbox 360 game system allows users to download applications that add to the functionality of the dashboard. Most apps required the user to be signed into a valid Xbox Live Gold account in order to use the features advertised for the given app. But as of the 2.0.16756.0 update, most apps do not require an Xbox Live Gold Subscription to access them, although the app may have its own subscription to be able to use it.Xbox Live  Xbox. xbox.com. Retrieved on 2020-04-13.Xbox Live#Xbox Live features With the exception of a few early apps, Microsoft has added partners to develop apps for the Xbox 360 system since the New Xbox Experience (NXE) Dashboard update in 2008. Following the success of Xbox One preview program launched in 2014, in March 2015, Microsoft announced the Xbox 360 preview program to the public. Technology=User interface Microsoft released the Xbox 360 console on November 22, 2005, a whole year earlier than both the Sony PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii. Having the advantage of the lead, Microsoft was able to experiment with various customization options for the consumer's individual consoles. The ability to customize the way the console looked with various themes to fit the front and sides of it was something very different for home console users. In system, the Xbox 360 Dashboard had the ability to have multiple profiles with password on the same console with each user being able to customize the dashboard to exactly fit their own unique style. There were premium themes available for purchase on the Xbox Live Marketplace apart from the default styles. Originally there were five tabs or sections known as the \\"blades\\" for the Xbox 360 menu, namely the Marketplace, Xbox live, Games, Media and System. In scrolling from left to right, each section would have a different-colored background signifying its own unique area but users also had the option to change all sections to one background color as well. In 2008 however, when the gaming scene changed dramatically because of the competitions with the PlayStation 3 and the Wii, a new Xbox Dashboard titled the New Xbox Experience (NXE) was launched, which features major changes in both the user interface and other functionalities. The new user interface had a navigation system similar to that of Windows Media Center. It contained a New pop-up/in-game Live Guide, using a redesigned version of the \\"blades\\" interface, a tabbed interface that featured five \\"blades\\". Also, users were able to create personalized Avatars, essentially mini characters of themselves. Furthermore, selecting an avatar is now required by the Xbox Live service. Two years later, Microsoft launched a new dashboard set for the release of the Microsoft Kinect, adding a fresh new user interface with a touch of silver, but in late 2011 a system update again came with a complete new user interface with a Metro-style design inspired by Windows Phone. The many enhancements that were included with this update pushed the system to a more modernized interface and improved features that pushed the envelope for social gaming and media. Multimedia features While the Xbox 360 console is primarily designed to play games just like other video game consoles, it can be used as a media player too. Similar to the PlayStation 3 from Sony, Xbox 360 has media center capabilities built in, so it is relatively easy to set up. With the Xbox 360 users can also copy videos directly to the hard drive, or play via a USB stick. There are two ways to watch videos on Xbox 360. The first is to download videos from the Xbox Live Marketplace. Some of these videos are available for free while others have to be paid. Microsoft is in control of what videos are available through the Xbox Live Marketplace. The second is to stream videos from a Windows Media Center PC by using Xbox 360 as a Media Center Extender. In this way users are in control of what videos they want to watch, however there are restrictions on what kind of video they can playback. More specifically, it only supports playback of DVR-MS, MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and WMV videos. Every Xbox 360 can play DVD movies out of the box using the built-in DVD drive, with no additional parts necessary, although the user may control everything with an optional remote. There are other improvements to the experience on the Xbox 360 over the original Xbox too, including the ability to upscale the image so it will look better. Progressive scan is another feature of the DVD output in the Xbox 360 that produces smoother output when playing movies on televisions that support high definition, although using a dedicated DVD player would offer even more features and sound quality. Backward compatibility The Xbox 360 system software includes built in software emulation support for the original Xbox game system. Software emulation is achieved with downloadable emulation profiles, which require a hard drive. Not all original Xbox games are supported; the last reported update to the compatibility list was in 2007 and support has since been discontinued for adding new titles. There are more than 400 titles on the list which covers most of the big name titles, and as a requirement for backwards compatibility the users have to have a hard drive for their Xbox 360, specifically an official Microsoft-brand Xbox 360 hard drive. In contrast, Xbox 360's successor, the Xbox One console was not backward compatible at launch, but after applying the November 2015 \\"New Xbox One Experience\\" system update it also supports a select group of Xbox 360 games using a software emulator, similar to Xbox 360's backward compatibility feature. However, there are also notable differences between the ways of their emulations‚Äîunlike Xbox 360's emulation of the original Xbox, by Xbox One's emulation of the Xbox 360 games do not have to be specifically patched but instead need to be repackaged in the Xbox One format. Xbox Live Preview Program Starting with the NXE Dashboard in November 2008, Larry Hryb (known on Xbox Live as \\"Major Nelson\\") and other team members hosted a new segment using Microsoft Connect to allow members of the Xbox Live community to get a chance to have a preview of the next dashboard. Small bug fixes & minor improvements were not included in the Preview Program; it was limited to major releases (NXE, Kinect, Metro) released in November of some years. In 2009, the Preview Program returned in August rather than November for a summer update. The Preview Program incentive enrollment started in either March/April or August/September, depending on when a major dashboard release was being planned. Applicants were notified no later than 2 weeks after the enrollment date with the new Preview Program dashboard launching on their consoles as early as 24 hours after acceptance. The Preview program is by invitation only. Users can be invited by their friends by using the Invite friends page in the Xbox Preview Dashboard app if their friends are already in the program. The Xbox Preview Dashboard app is the place for Preview participants to give feedback about the program, get the latest news, change console enrollment settings, and report problems. If users decide that they didn't want to get Preview updates anymore they could opt out in the Xbox Preview Dashboard app. All details for the Preview Program were located on the Xbox official website. The Xbox Live Preview Program for the Xbox 360 has since been discontinued.[citation needed] History of updates The first version of the Xbox 360 system software was 2.0.1888.0, released on November 22, 2005, as shipped in the original Xbox 360 consoles, although the version numbered \\"2.0\\" was available at product launch. Over the course of next a few years saw the continuous updates of the system software. While early updates such as version 2.0.4532.0 released on October 31, 2006 added supports for 1080p video output and the external HD DVD drive attachment, version 2.0.7357.0 released on November 19, 2008 was the first major upgrade of the system software, titled the New Xbox Experience that had added many new features, including a completely redesigned GUI. It included changes in the menu system, featuring a more 3D style vibe with more options and sections, new sound effects (menus only, notification sounds remain the same), support for 1440√ó900 and 1680√ó1050 16:10 resolutions (letterboxed) over VGA, HDMI and when using DVI, as well as the abilities to preview themes before setting them, to disable notifications (new messages, chat requests, etc.) or mute the notification sound, and to change to QWERTY keyboard in place of alphabetical keyboard. Subsequent system software updates after this major upgrade continued to add (although usually numerically smaller) new features or make other changes, including bugfixes. An example of the new features introduced in version 2.0.8498.0 released on August 11, 2009 was the addition of Display Discovery to allow console to override factory settings for HDTV resolutions and refresh rates as well as discovering the best possible resolution and refresh rates that the HDTV is capable of displaying (Selected HDTVs). Version 2.0.12611.0 released on November 1, 2010 also added features such as the ability to install game updates to the HDD (select games only) and a visual refresh to incorporate elements of Microsoft's Metro design style. It also featured a new boot screen animation with redesigned Xbox 360 orb and ribbons. New anti-piracy 2.5 scheme to newly released games was also added in this version, later updated to anti- piracy 2.6 in the version 2.0.13599.0 released on July 19, 2011. Version 2.0.14699.0 released on December 6, 2011 introduced a redesigned interface and a fresh new take on a platform that has had more than half a decade of changes and enhancements. The releases after the version 2.0.16197.0 released October 16, 2012 were typically minor, usually bugfixes or as a mandatory update that prepared for subsequent growth of the service, but the system software is still being constantly updated by now. On June 15, 2020 the advertisements included on the Xbox 360 software were removed via a server-side update without notice.

It was published by Penguin Books on 29 March 2007 for the United Kingdom market. In the United States and Canada it is published under the title Strawberry Fields. The story focuses on characters who are migrant labourers of various backgrounds working in England's agricultural industry, in particular, portraying Eastern Europeans in the United Kingdom. The book follows Lewycka's debut novel A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian, and was shortlisted for the Orwell Prize for political writing in 2008.  Plot summary  A crew of migrant workers from three continents are forced to flee their English strawberry field for a journey across all of England in pursuit of their various dreams of a better future. The story centres on a group of migrant workers who hail from Eastern Europe, China, Malaysia and Africa and have come to Kent to harvest strawberries for delivery to the supermarkets, and end up living in two small caravans, a men's caravan and a women's caravan. They are all seeking a better life (and in their different ways they are also, of course, looking for love) and they've come to England, some legally, some illegally, to find it. They are supervised by Farmer Leapish, a red-faced man who treats everyone equally except for the Polish woman named Yola, the boss of the crew, who favours him with her charms in exchange for something a little extra on the side. But the two are discreet, and all is harmonious in this cozy vale ‚Äì until the evening when Farmer Leapish's wife comes upon him and Yola and in retaliation she runs him down in her red sports car. By the time the police arrive the migrant workers (and a dog called Dog) have piled into one of the trailer homes and quickly leave their arcadia, thus setting off on a journey across the length and breadth of England.  Stage adaptation  An operatic adaptation of Two Caravans, written by Ace McCarron and composed by Guy Harries, won the Flourish new opera competition in 2012. The adaptation premiered at the King's Head Theatre in 2013.

It borders on Sandbanks, Canford Cliffs, Lower Parkstone, and Whitecliff and has a shoreline within Poole Harbour with views of Brownsea Island and the Purbeck Hills. Brownsea Island stands opposite Lilliput's harbour foreshore and is famous as the birthplace of Baden Powell's International Scouting Movement. Lilliput itself was host to a number of early scouting camps. During the Second World War at one stage it provided Britain's only civilian air route: Poole Harbour was temporary home to the Imperial Airways/BOAC flying boat fleet, which had its passenger HQ at Salterns.Post box in LilliputWell known residents have included modernist writer Mary Butts, a very young John le Carre and disc-jockey Tony Blackburn. Impresario Fred Karno who popularised the custard-pie-in-the-face comedy routine spent his last years in the village as a part-owner of an off-licence, bought with financial help from Charlie Chaplin, and died here in 1941 aged 75. The old post office  Development  The area occupying the northern shore of Poole Harbour was often referred to by the Victorians as \\"Parkstone-on-Sea\\". Mary Butts wrote about the local landscape and her childhood in one of the old mansions at the turn of the twentieth century in her autobiography The Crystal Cabinet - My Childhood at Salterns (1937). Her great grandfather had been a principal patron of the English romantic poet and artist William Blake, and her Lilliput home housed a large collection of Blake paintings (now in Tate Britain). The autobiography was named after one of Blake's poems. She adored the area and was critical of the kind of development then taking place in Lilliput and Poole-Parkstone- Bournemouth which she thought soulless, and far from the 'garden city' it could be. Aside from an enclave behind Evening Hill, a local beauty spot with panoramic views over Poole Harbour, modern development started in the later 1920s as more of the older estates were sold for suburban projects. A number of distinctive art-deco homes were built, including the landmark Salterns Court building at the new shopping parade. Before its development as a residential and recreational area there had been industrial projects at Salterns, which had been the district's local name. Some claim a connection to Jonathan Swift and his famous Gulliver's Travels novel, and there are local streets which have associated names. The name 'Lilliput' probably derives from Lilliput House, an old country mansion built near Evening Hill, which may have been owned by renowned smuggler Isaac Gulliver or one of his relatives. . Lilliput is host to a number of sailing clubs based on the harbour shoreline. A recent proposal for a major redevelopment at Salterns marina, has sparked controversy about who will benefit from this. Despite strong local opposition Poole Councillors approved the scheme in May 2016, with planning chairman Pawlowski claiming \\"this town needs to protect its economy and to provide jobs ... we should be taking advantage of our harbour to promote and help our area .‚Äù An idea of contemporary Lilliput can be gained by following the local circular walk (1c) described by Poole Harbour Trails.  Today  Recent years have seen many new property development projects, especially in water frontage or harbour view locations, and often earlier buildings have been replaced entirely. Lilliput is home to a hotel 'Salterns Harbourside', the Lilliput C of E Infants First School, and an Anglican church 'The Church of the Holy Angels'. A recent census (2005) indicated the number of electors as 3048 with the largest single group (29%) being 65+yrs of age, the majority of homes are privately owned, and a significant number of homes (22%) are households of one member who is a pensioner; many households (14%) consist of married couples with dependent children; most residents who work are professional people and many work in Poole or Bournemouth. The dilemma of development is described in The Dorset Village Book: \\"much of Lilliput's woodland has disappeared, the sound of saws rasping through the trunks as prominent as the speeding traffic along the road to Sandbanks. Almost every inch of this beautiful place has been sacrificed to the builders and even parts of the cliff-face have been built on. Who can blame anyone for wanting to come here to live, to enjoy the rich sunsets over Wareham Channel, to smell the sweet cool breezes which waft in from the bay, and to marvel at the view across Poole Harbour and Brownsea Island.

Ayres broke into radio in the late 1940s in Washington, DC, and was one of the first women to make the new technology a full-time career. In the 1950s, Ayres teamed up with Walt Teas, another nationally known voice from Baltimore, to become one of the first freelance voiceover teams in the radio industry. Over the next 30 years, Ayres, along with Teas and another personality, Joe Knight, recorded thousands of commercials and syndicated programs on a national scale, mostly at Baltimore's version of Hollywood, Flite Three Studios, and overseen by legendary audio engineer, Louis Mills. In the 1960s and 1970s, Ayres also taught radio and communications at several Baltimore-area institutes of higher learning, such as Johns Hopkins University, Goucher College, and Towson University, and has collaborated on projects with famous Vatican painter Joseph Sheppard and Beatles' photographer Morton Tadder. Ayres also has had an extensive solo career spanning over 50 years. In addition to radio commercials, Ayres has narrated for such institutions as the National Geographic Society, SeaWorld, and the AARP. During the past twenty-five years, Ayres has hosted regular radio shows such as \\"Tuning into Life,\\" \\"The Heart of the Matter,\\" and she wrote and produced the radio series \\"For the Young at Heart.\\" Ayres wrote, produced, and starred in a children's music CD about manners, entitled \\"Doo-zees and Don't-zees,\\" which was released in May, 2007.

The son of a vine-grower, he at first laboured in the fields, and did not begin his studies till the age of seventeen. Ordained priest in 1817, he was a curate for several months, and was then charged with teaching moraI theology at the Grand S√©minaire of Besan√ßon. He retained this chair until 1830, acquiring the reputation of an expert professor and consummate casuist. It was then he re-edited with accompanying notes and dissertations the Conf√©rences d'Angers (26 vols., 1823), and the Dictionnaire th√©ologique of Bergier (1826), of which he published another edition in 1843.

Jackson \\"Blackburn Aircraft since 1909\\" Putnam & Co Ltd (1968) Blackburn was born in Kirkstall, Leeds, Yorkshire, England. He attended Leeds Modern School and graduated in engineering at the University of Leeds, and built his first aircraft, a monoplane, in 1909. He made his first short flight on the sandy beach at Filey in the spring of 1909. The aircraft was badly damaged in 1910 when he attempted to make a turn.Roots In The Sky - A History of British Aerospace Aircraft, Oliver Tapper (1980), ; p. 7. He moved to Filey and built a second monoplane which established his reputation as an aviation pioneer and in 1911 founded the Blackburn Aeroplane Company. In 1914 he married Jessica, and also in 1914 he created the Blackburn Aeroplane & Motor Company, establishing it in a new factory at Brough, East Riding of Yorkshire in 1916. He also opened a factory at Roundhay, Leeds in 1914, which was forced to shut down in 1920 after the closure of Roundhay Aerodrome. He introduced the first scheduled air service in Great Britain, offering half-hourly flights between Leeds and Bradford. In 1919 he set up the North Sea Aerial Navigation Company, using surplus World War I aeroplanes, which operated a regular passenger service between Leeds and Hounslow, London as well as cargo flights between cities, including Leeds and Amsterdam. In 1917 Blackburn and his wife purchased Bowcliffe Hall at Bramham, near Wetherby as their home. He was the founder of the Scarcroft golf club. In 1950 he retired, leaving Bowcliffe Hall and moving to Devon. On his death in Devon in 1955 the Blackburn company's production facilities became part of Hawker Siddeley. The Robert Blackburn building at University of Hull commemorates him.

Each scented flower has the sepals and petals united forming a lip of a tube. The labellum, or lower petal, of the flower is white with green veins.Parnell, J. and Curtis, T. 2012. Webb's An Irish Flora. Cork University Press. The plant flowers in late summer. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the tiny dust-like seed is distributed by the wind. However the plant can also reproduce vegetatively by means of root tubers which can grow new shoots while the old parts of the plant die. The orchid is associated with a mycorrhizal fungus which can provide it with essential nutrients. Distribution and habitat Hooded ladies' tresses was first described by the German botanist Adelbert von Chamisso. He named it in honour of his patron Nikolay Rumyantsev who had financed the scientific exploration to the Americas in 1815‚Äì1818 on which he found the orchid. It is common in North America, including Canada and the United States, but also grows in a few locations in Scotland, England, and Ireland. The first Irish record was made in 1810 in County Cork.Hackney,P. Ed. 1992. Stewart & Corry's Flora of the North-east of Ireland. Third edition. Institute of Irish Studies, The Queen's University of Belfast Since then it has been found in a number of other locations in Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the Lough Neagh basin and the Mourne Mountains and the hills of Antrim. It grows along lakeshores and in damp pastures. The distribution pattern, occurring on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, is puzzling.

Born in Galway, his father was called Michael Barrett and his mother Mary McDonough. He had two sisters and one brother. He was a member of the Moycullen group of the Irish Volunteers in 1916 and soon after became an IRA volunteer. He was also a member of the IRB and Sinn F√©in. He was part of a group of Volunteers who were involved in the burning of the RIC Barracks in Rosmuc in 1920. He began his journalistic career with the Galway Express, a weekly republican paper. In 1922 he joined the Irish Independent, writing on politics, and would later become the newspaper's editor in 1945. While working for the Independent he was presented the Irish Academy of Letters Award (1938). Bair√©ad also invented his own Irish shorthand. His close friend, M√°irt√≠n √ì Cadhain, urged him to leave the IRA to focus on his writings. Bair√©ad at Ricorso Early life Thomas Barrett (1893‚Äì1973), An Bair√©adach, or Tom√°s Bair√©ad, as he was also known, was a journalist and Irish language author. He was born in on 7 July 1893 in Ballydotia, Moycullen, County Galway. He married Ellen Maher (1903‚Äì1947) from Clonard, county Westmeath in Corpus Christi Church, St Martin's (Maiden Lane), London on 25 June 1930. Ellen's father, James was also a farmer. They had two daughters, Treasa, a nurse, and Maura, a librarian. He was a fine athlete and sportsman, and as a young man played gaelic football and hurling with his native parish team. When he was barely 17 years of age, Bair√©ad was involved in castle rustling. The cattle, in the ownership of the landlord George Burke, were driven from Burke's land at Cnoc a' tSean Bhaile. Bair√©ad's involvement in this activity was in reaction to the eviction of a number of his neighbours by the landlord, and resulted in him spending some time in gaol. Bair√©ad was primarily self- educated.http://gccapps.galwaycoco.ie/ArchivedDocuments/Bair%C3%A9ad,%20Thomas,%20Papers,%201820-1973,%20GP2/Descriptive%20List,%20Tomas%20Bair%C3%A9ad%20Papers,%20GP2.pdf Personal life and career Bair√©ad was a member of the Moycullen group of the Irish Volunteers (√ìglaigh na h-√âireann) in 1916. He was a member of the IRB and Sinn F√©in, and administered the IRB oath to new members. He was friendly with Liam Mellows and Proinsias √ì hEidhin, and others who were leaders of the 1916 Rebellion in county Galway. He was one of a group of Volunteers involved in the burning of the RIC Barracks in Rosmuc in 1920. For these and other republican activities he spent sometime in Galway Gaol. Bairead commenced his journalistic career with the Galway Express, a weekly republican paper, in 1917. When paper's printing press was destroyed by the RIC, and Black and Tans in 1920, he transferred to the Connacht Tribune. During this period he had an address at 5 Nuns' Island, Galway. He was appointed to the staff of the Irish Independent on 18 September 1922. In 1945 he became responsible for the Irish language page. In 1930 he purchased the family home, 3 Beechmount Villas, Glasnevin, Dublin, where he lived until he retired to Moycullen in 1948. While with the Independent he travelled to and reported on various Celtic Congresses held in Wales, Scotland and the Isle of Man, and in 1943 he reported on √âamon de Valera's general election campaign. He wrote extensively during the 1930s and 1940s. His first collection of short-stories, Cumhacht na Cinneamhna, was published by An G√∫m in 1936. The collection received very positive reviews, with the Connacht Tribune writing, 'In originality, technique and language, those stories probably surpass anything of their kind published in Irish', and 'It will not be surprising if a few of those stories find their way among the classics', while the Irish Times wrote, \\"While the language is rich, idiomatic and adequate, the stories themselves could well be the authentic work of a novelist in any language'. Bair√©ad was awarded the O'Growney Award by the Irish Academy of Letters for this collection in 1937. His next collection An Geall a Briseadh followed shortly afterwards, again published by An G√∫m. This was a collection of short stories and sketches dealing mainly with scenes and events familiar to Bair√©ad in his native countryside. This book also received positive reviews, such as one writing that Bair√©ad \\"is undoubtedly a discovery and a decided addition to the ranks of Gaelic writers\\". For this collection he was awarded the Douglas Hyde Literary Fund('Ciste an Chraoibhin Aoibhin'), in 1938 for the best original work in the Irish language. The book was placed on the syllabus for the Matriculation (University entrance examination) in 1940, and later the Department of Education included it on the school syllabus for 1953‚Äì1954. His next accomplishment Cruithneacht agus Ceannabh√°in, a collection of 13 short stories, was published by Talbot Press in 1940. In 1949, √ìr na hAithinne was published. His last great work, Gan Baisteadh, which is semi-autobiographical, contained 33 chapters each telling a different story. This was published by S√°irseal agus Dill in 1969. In 1973 As an nG√©ibheann was published. This was a collection of the correspondence between Tom√°s and M√°irt√≠n √ì Cadhain, during M√°irt√≠n's time in prison. Bair√©ad also received awards for other short stories, such as Second Prize in Class 4, Irish, Short Story for his entry 'Ruaidhri Ruadh, an Stil√©ara', in the Tailteann Literary Competitions in 1931, and an Oireachtas Certificate for first prize for the short story, 'Duais an Mhaol√°naigh' in 1951. Bair√©ad's daughter, Treasa (the donor of the collection) also has in her possession a medal inscribed as follows, 'Aonach Tailteann 1932 (an Bhainnriogain Tailte).http://www.iar.ie/Archive.shtml?IE+GCCA%2FGP2 Involvement in 1916 Easter Rising Tom√°s Bair√©ad's main involvement in the 1916 Easter Rising was through the form of newspapers. His newspaper clippings include details of events in the Moycullen area during the Easter week of 1916, and also includes references to the 1919 local election. As well as those it also includes a transcript of the Irish Republican Brotherhood's oath. The collection is full with names associated with Irish republicanism and Irish politics, such as Liam Mellows, Se√°n McDermot, √âamon de Valera, and Jack Lynch. The letters from Bair√©ad's friend Morchadh √ì Dabhorionn, are fascinating as they reveal something resembling that of the loneliness of an Irish emigrant. The quote states \\"‚Ä¶nearer to me than √ârin go Brac with all its faults and shortcoming, it is to me the greatest and is closest to my heart.

The airline acquired its first Beech 99 Airliner twin-engined turboprop passenger airliner in June 1971 and used this type to commence French internal services. These aircraft remained in operation with TAT until 1975.Eastwood and Roach, 1998, p. 57 During the 1970s TAT began building up a comprehensive network of regional, short-haul domestic and international scheduled routes, as a result of being taken over in 1973 by Soci√©t√© Auxiliare de Services et Materiel A√©ronautiques (SASMAT), the owner of rival French regional airline Rousseau Aviation, as well as the subsequent mergers with regional rivals Taxi Avia France and Air Paris. The resulting regional network served 30 provincial points in France and neighbouring European countries from Paris Orly, Lyons Satolas, Lille and St. Brieuc, respectively. Many of TAT's French domestic routes were operated in collaboration with Air Inter, at the time the dominant domestic scheduled airline in France as well as the largest domestic airline in Europe. Most international routes were operated in conjunction with Air France, the primary French flag carrier at the time. Year-round services linking Lille with London Heathrow as well as Strasbourg with Milan Linate and a seasonal B√©ziers-London Gatwick service were among the international routes TAT operated during that time. All joint operations with Air Inter and Air France were operated under those airlines' flight numbers and were prefixed with those carriers' two-letter airline identification codes as allocated by IATA, i.e. IT for Air Inter and AF for Air France. The aircraft used on all year-round international operations under contract to Air France wore that airline's full aircraft livery. A TAT Fokker 100 on final approach at Zurich Airport in 1992 From the late 1970s until the early 1980s, TAT used to operate a scheduled German internal route linking Saarbr√ºcken with Berlin Tegel. This route was operated on behalf of TAT Export, a wholly owned subsidiary.Berlin Airport Company, December 1977-January 1984 Monthly Timetable Booklets for Berlin Tempelhof and Berlin Tegel Airports, Berlin Airport Company, West Berlin, 1977-1984 The airline also started an express delivery services company in 1976 which still exists as of 2007.TAT Express, express industrial transport During the early 1980s TAT acquired regional rivals Air Alpes and Air Alsace. As a result of these mergers, the airline established itself as France's largest regional airline as well as the leading regional partner of Air France. It also resulted in an expanded network covering more than 50 points throughout France and Europe. TAT changed its official name to Transport A√©rien Transr√©gional in 1984 to reflect the growth in its scheduled route network. In July 1989 Air France acquired a 35% stake in TAT. (At that time TAT was the fourth-largest French airline [after Air France, Air Inter and UTA].UTA take-over makes Air France Europe's second-favourite airline, Operations: Air Transport, Flight International, 24-30 January 1990, p. 10)Soci√©t√© Air France: Information and Much More from Answers.com In the early 1990s TAT began taking advantage of the EU's newly liberalised internal air transport market by launching a three times daily scheduled service between Paris-Charles de Gaulle and London Gatwick, the first time it had operated a scheduled service on a major international European trunk route.TAT competes on Paris-London route, Air Transport, Flight International, 8-14 April 1992, p. 8 This was also the time TAT began marketing itself as TAT European Airlines. Boeing 737-200 landing at Orly Airport (1995) In January 1993 British Airways acquired a 49.9% stake in TAT.Strikes in the air transport industry From then on TAT began operating all international scheduled services in British Airways colours and under BA flight numbers. TAT also joined the British Airways Executive Club frequent flier programme at that time. The change in ownership furthermore resulted in the launch of two new international routes linking Lyon and Marseille with London Gatwick from the start of the 1993 summer timetable period. TAT's subsequent launch of three daily return flights between Paris Orly and London Heathrow complemented British Airways' own thrice daily Heathrow-Orly service. This enabled British Airways to circumvent the slot restrictions the slot co-ordinator for the airports in the Paris region had imposed on Orly's non-resident airline users, which limited each of these airlines to holding a maximum of four daily pairs of slots, and to offer up to six daily round-trips on that route. As a result of these developments, Air France ended all commercial co-operation with TAT. In August 1996 British Airways acquired the remaining 50.1% of TAT's share capital, thus acquiring 100% ownership. In 1997 British Airways brought TAT under joint management control with Air Libert√©, in which it had acquired a controlling stake in October 1996. British Airways subsequently merged TAT into Air Libert√© to achieve a significant reduction in costs and greater operational synergies. The UK flag carrier eventually disposed of the merged entity in May 2001 to rid itself of years of heavy losses and difficult labour relations at its French subsidiaries. Aircraft types operated Super King Air at Nancy Airport in 1990 Throughout its existence TAT operated a variety of piston-engined commuter airliners as well as regional turboprop and jet aircraft, including the following main types: * A√©rospatiale Corvette * Beech King Air C90 * Beech 99/99A * Boeing 737-200 * Fairchild F-27A * Fairchild- Hiller FH-227B * Fokker F.27 Friendship * Fokker F.28 Fellowship (1000/2000/4000 series) * Fokker 100 * McDonnell Douglas DC-9 (10/20 series) * Nord 262 * VFW 614 Incidents and accidents During its existence TAT suffered two fatal accidents and four non-fatal incidents. These occurred between 1975 and 1991.Aviation-safety.net list of Touraine Air Transport accidents.Aviation-safety.net list of Transport A√©rien Transr√©gional accidents. Fatal accidents The first fatal accident occurred on 2 July 1975. One of the airline's Beech 99 commuter airliners (registration F-BTQE) operating a scheduled domestic flight from Nantes to Brest crashed on take-off from Nantes Airport due to the failure of the aircraft's no. 2 engine, as a result of which it caught fire. The aircraft came down on a nearby railway line. All eight occupants, including both pilots and six passengers were killed in this accident.Aviation-safety.net F-BTQE accident description. The second fatal accident occurred on 4 March 1988. It involved one of the company's Fairchild-Hiller FH227Bs (registration F-GCPS) operating an early morning scheduled service from Nancy to Paris Orly as TAT Flight 230. An electrical system malfunction during the start of the aircraft's descent on the final portion of its flight to Paris Orly resulted in a sudden loss of control. This in turn caused the aircraft to descend very rapidly. It struck power lines and crashed near Fontainebleau, killing all 23 occupants (two pilots, one flight attendant and 20 passengers). This accident constituted the firm's worst air disaster in terms of loss of life.Aviation-safety.net F-GCPS accident description. Non-fatal incidents On 5 July 1979 a Fairchild F-27A (registration F-GBRS) with 18 occupants on board was damaged beyond repair in an incident that occurred on the ground at Paris Orly while the aircraft was stationary. None of the aircraft's occupants were injured as a result of that incident. The aircraft was subsequently written off.Aviation- safety.net F-GBRS accident description.

Sprecher's former hardware store, located along Main Street The Ephrata Fair is held each year in Ephrata, Lancaster County, and is the largest street fair in Pennsylvania. History In the late 1910s, such businessmen in Ephrata as Harry Singer, Dutch Butcher, Charles Yeager, and I.G. Sprecher decided to hold a celebration in honor of World War I veterans. Mr. Singer was in charge of the group, and in 1918, he paid for the erection of a memorial to World War I veterans. The aforementioned group of men, along with other businessmen, created and funded the first Ephrata Fair. In 1922, what is now known as the Ephrata Fair was officially called the Ephrata Farmer‚Äôs Day Fair. In the 1920s, the celebration was extended to three days and welcomed the addition of a Mummers Parade. The Ephrata Farmer‚Äôs Day Fair was held in October from the year of its conception to the 1940s. After that time, the event was scheduled to be held in September due to the inclement weather of October. In the 1930s, the Ephrata Cloister Post #429, American Legion would distribute a free automobile through the use of a raffle. The winner would be drawn between 12:00 and 12:30 AM. This event did not survive World War II since cars became much more scarce during that time. There were many changes to the Ephrata Fair after World War II. With the contribution of a baby parade, more entertainment rides, and a beauty pageant, the Fair began to take on a larger form. The parade was moved to Wednesday evenings, which is still the tradition today. Around 1966, Tent City was added to the Ephrata Fair. One of individuals responsible for the addition of this agricultural attraction was a vo-ag teacher at Ephrata named Charles Ackley. Tent City took shape every year in the Ephrata Park on the baseball diamond beside the Cocalico Creek. Two of the main attractions of Tent City were the pig chase and a chicken chase for the kids. This was ended after multiple protesters that claimed this was animal abuse. One can also view a sheep show, a hog show, a dairy and beef show. and an annual tractor pull. The Ephrata Fair also has some claim to history with national significance. In 1953, Evelyn Ay won the Miss Lancaster County Pageant that was held every Saturday night during fair week. Evelyn Ay then won the Miss America title in Atlantic City. For her talent, Miss Ay read Henry Wadsworth Longfellow‚Äôs poem, ‚ÄúThe Song of Hiawatha.‚Äù The fair has been held nearly every year, except for cancellations from 1942‚Äì45 due to World War II as well as in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior Festivals Before the Ephrata Fair that is widely known today, there were many other festivals held in the little town of Ephrata, Pennsylvania. In the 1880s, the Ephrata Baseball Club would hold fairs on what was then known as Baker‚Äôs Lot. Between the 1880s and early 1900s, the Mountain Springs Rifles would hold celebrations on the Mountain Springs Hotel. In the 1880s and 1890s, the Ephrata Cornet Band would hold festivities in Reddig‚Äôs Hall and the Ephrata Band Hall. From 1891 to 1926, the Pioneer Fire Company held fairs in the Band Hall. The month of the annual celebration varied between January and February. It is worth noting that Ephrata‚Äôs first street fair was prior to World War I. The Ephrata Park Association held several of these festivals on Main Street prior to 1914. The organization bought land from Samuel Heinicke with the intention of converting the property into a community park. In fact, the present day location of this land is the Ephrata Community Park. The location of this street fair was the section of Main Street between State Street and Lake Street.

All Saints church was built between 1620 and 1630 and was adopted for Carmelites' needs. In the second half of the 17th century, the church was linked with a monastery and formed a single complex. History A large old-regulation Carmelite monastery adjoins the church; it is built by adapting existing buildings. In 1631‚Äì32, the main two-storey building following the street was completed; there are also several buildings of a later period and a tow-storey novitiate house with a small courtyard at the city wall. In the 16th‚Äì18th centuries they actively participated in public life, held religious feasts and processions. In 1819 the Carmelites established a parochial school in the monastery. The Church of all Saints is at the end of a street where the main gate to the Jewish ghetto was. During World War II, there was a tunnel through the sewers connecting the church with the ghetto. The priest of the church would provide bread to be taken into the ghetto through the tunnel. He also hid some Jews smuggled out of the ghetto through the tunnel. There were also Christian Lithuanians who helped smuggle Litvaks food into the ghetto. In Soviet times the church housed a museum of folk art after the reconstruction between 1967 and 1975. Architecture Interior of the church The bell tower is high and massive with elaborate decorations. After a fire in the 18th century, it was restored and finished with a rococo-style dome roof. Marcin Knackfus prepared project for the church's altar. Above the high altar rises another altar reminiscent of a royal throne with a canopy. A belfry was erected and the sculptures in the interior were created in the 18th century. In 1859 the polychrome interior d√©cor was enriched. East of the church lies a square, in which the Convent of the Barefoot Carmelites once stood alongside a Baroque Church of St. Joseph the Betrothed established in 1638 by the Vice-Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Stephen Pac. Its exterior was reminiscent of the Church of St. Theresa, Vilnius.Prof. Tomas Venclova. VILNIUS; R.

The ship was named for a mountain located between Osaka and Nara prefectures. Background Katsuragi was designed as an iron-ribbed, wooden-hulled, three-masted barque-rigged sloop-of-war with a coal-fired double-expansion reciprocating steam engine with six cylindrical boilers driving a double screw.Chesneau, All the World‚Äôs Fighting Ships, p. 233. Her basic design was based on experience gained in building and sloops, but was already somewhat obsolescent in comparison to contemporary European warships when completed. Katsuragi was laid down at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal 18 August 1883 under the direction of British-educated Japanese naval architect Sas≈ç Sach≈´. She was launched on 31 March 1885 and commissioned on 4 November 1887. Operational history Katsuragi saw combat service in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, patrolling between Korea, Dairen and Weihaiwei. She was also at the Battle of Yalu River in a reserve capacity in the Western Sea Fleet. On 21 March 1898, Katsuragi was re- designated a third-class gunboat,Nishida, Ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy and was used for coastal survey and patrol duties. On 6 October 1900, Katsuragi ran aground off of Izu ≈åshima. It took over a month to refloat her, after which she underwent extensive repairs at Yokosuka, during which time her sail rigging was removed, and she was rearmed with eight QF 2.5 pdr guns and six quadruple Nordenfelt guns, and her torpedoes were upgraded from 15 inch to 18-inch torpedo tubes. During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, Katsuragi served as a guard ship in Nagasaki harbor. Katsuragi was refitted again in 1907, when her guns were replaced with four 3-inch and two 2.5-inch guns, and she was reclassified as a survey ship. She was reclassified again as a second- class coastal patrol vessel on 28 August 1912, and was removed from the navy list and scrapped on 4 November 1913.

It is the successor to Remote Installation Services. WDS is intended to be used for remotely deploying Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2016, but also supports other operating systems because unlike its predecessor RIS, which was a method of automating the installation process, WDS uses disk imaging, in particular the Windows Imaging Format (WIM). WDS is included as a Server Role in all 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows Server 2008, and is included as an optionally installable component with Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2.  Automated image capture and apply  WDS functions in conjunction with the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) to load a miniature edition of Windows known as Windows PE for installation and maintenance tasks. WDS functions as both a storage repository for the PXE network boot images as well as a repository for the actual operating system images to be installed on the target computer. When multiple boot images are available, PXE booting via WDS will present the end- user with a boot menu to select the image to load.  Windows PE automation using Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit  To simplify the tasks of capturing and applying images, two special scripted Windows PE boot images can be created which automate these tasks. These scripted Windows PE boot images are created using the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK; previously named Windows Automated Installation Kit, WAIK), in combination with Windows 7 installation media containing the source WIM images, and then added to the WDS server's boot image repository. The Windows PE boot images may be either 32- or 64-bit, but 32-bit tends to be more universally compatible across all potential hardware types. A difficulty of Windows PE booting is that it needs to include network drivers and disk controller drivers intended to work with the target hardware to be imaged. The process of adding drivers to the Windows PE boot image can be automated using the WDS server console: # Select the source WIM image, which may be either a new one created from original Windows 7 installation DVDs (32- or 64-bit), or a previously configured WIM. # Select the drivers to install into the WIM # WDS mounts the WIM to a virtual path, adds drivers to the virtual path, and generates a new WIM # The updated WIM image is added to the boot image section of the WDS repository This process can be repeated at a later time when a new system type needs to be captured but the current Windows PE Capture boot image does not include network drivers for it. The boot image is updated with the additional drivers using the WDS interface and automatically re-added to the WDS boot image collection to replace the original. For specialty one-off systems this WIM driver update process is not necessary if the hard drive of the target system to be captured is removed from the source system after sysprepping, and is either installed in a computer with supported network drivers, or attached to the supported system using an external \\"USB to hard drive\\" adapter.  Automated apply process  Applying a captured image involves running a second Windows PE \\"Apply\\" boot image on the target system to receive the image. This boot image also needs the appropriate network and disk controller drivers as with the Windows PE Capture boot image. # The system is booted using PXE network booting and the Windows PE Apply image is loaded. # The operator logs on to the domain, and selects the boot image to apply. # A disk partitioning screen appears and the location for the target image is selected. If the target storage is unformatted, a default partition set is created. For Vista and Windows 7, a small 100 megabyte boot partition is created for storing bootloader data separate from the rest of the system partition. This boot partition is normally hidden from the Windows Vista/7 user. # The image data is applied to the selected partition, and the system reboots, either running the Sysprep manual mini-setup process or following the script created during the initial Sysprepping. The WDS image creator may optionally select a separate WAIK / Sysprep installation script to be applied to the image during the first boot. This alternate script is selected within WDS by viewing the properties of each uploaded system image.  Manual image capture and deploy  It is technically possible to create scripts that manually perform the imaging, capture, and apply processes, using command line tools provided by Microsoft. However, the methods for doing this are complex and difficult. In general, the tools involved are: * dism - Deployment Image Service and Management Tool, used to add drivers to Windows PE boot images. * imagex - used to capture and apply images. Creates either a single WIM structure, or can deduplicate data using a second shared resource WIM. Does not require a Windows Deployment Server to capture or apply images, and can work solely with a logged-on network share or mapped drive letter. * wdsutil - used to manage the WDS server without the graphical user interface, and to add captured images to the repository. Using imagex to manually create a WIM does not require the source operating system to be sysprepped or for the source partition to contain a Windows operating system. Any type of Windows- accessible file system can be imaged, including MSDOS, but the source system either needs to be able to run Windows PE or the source system's hard drive is moved into a newer system that supports Windows PE. Microsoft generally requires Windows 2000, XP, Vista, and Windows 7 to be sysprepped before imaging, due to certain security-related disk data that Microsoft requires to be unique across duplicated system images. Sysprep randomizes this data when the image is applied to a new system. Imagex does not have any disk formatting and partitioning capabilities. Separate Windows command line tools such as diskpart are needed to define partitions on the target system for imagex to use.

For 27 years, when not on TV, these pets were often looked after by Blue Peter's long-standing pet keeper Edith Menezes, who died in 1994. The exceptions were the dogs Petra, Shep and Goldie, who lived with Peter Purves, John Noakes and Simon Groom respectively, for which the three presenters were paid a stipend for their upkeep.Baxter, Biddy: Blue Peter - The Inside Story. Interpet Ringpull BBC Books. The first pet was a dog named Petra in 1962, and since then there have been several dogs, cats, tortoises, parrots, and horses. The current animals on the show are Shelley the tortoise and Henry the beagle. Rags, a pony, named by viewers, was purchased with the proceeds of a Christmas appeal in the late 1970s as a Riding for the Disabled horse. The Blue Peter parrot‚ÄîJoey, and one successor, Barney‚Äîfeatured in the 1960s, but when Barney, a blue-fronted amazon, died, he was not replaced. In a 1986 documentary shown on BBC2 as part of the Did You See...? series, former presenter Peter Purves recalled that Biddy Baxter, the show's editor, had called him in floods of tears on the day that the first parrot Joey died. He went on to muse in the same interview that had he himself died, Baxter would have been far less upset. The original ideas behind featuring the programme's pets were to teach viewers who had animals of their own how to look after them, and for the creatures to act as surrogate pets for those that did not own any. For example, dog training items, tortoise hibernation, and cat care are often featured on the programme; however, the keeping of rabbits and mice was deemed not suitable as they do not live long. In addition, dogs that lived with the presenters often accompanied them on filming assignments. Dogs= Petra  Petra was a female mongrel that appeared on Blue Peter between 1962 and 1977. Petra was the first Blue Peter pet, and remains one of the best known. Up to May 2011, Petra is the longest serving Blue Peter pet.\\"Blue Peter dog Mabel to retire\\", Daily Telegraph, 11 March 2010 She was weighed on one of the episodes and found to weigh about 2 stone (28 lbs, 13 kg). She had several puppies, including Patch, who also became a Blue Peter pet, and who predeceased her. Petra lost her teeth at an early age, but this was not necessarily a bad thing; Blue Peter presenter Peter Purves once said that she was often bad-tempered and would \\"gum you to death\\" if she had the chance.{{citation neededdate=F When Purves started working on the Blue Peter show and became Petra's handler on the set, Petra had already been on the show for about five years. Petra was an irritable nervous dog on the set, so Biddy Baxter had the idea that Purves should be Petra's permanent keeper, and so he looked after her at his home too. He became fond of Petra and was sad when she died, having been her owner for more than nine years.Interview with Peter Purves on The Paul O'Grady Show. Channel 4. 7 October 2008 There is a bust of Petra in the Blue Peter garden. It originally stood in front of BBC Television Centre but was moved to the garden in 1984 due to redevelopment works and now stands in the current garden at MediaCityUK. It was later revealed that the original (unnamed) puppy had died of distemper a few days after her first appearance on Blue Peter, broadcast just before Christmas 1962. Instead of informing viewers, and feeling there was no need to upset children needlessly, the programme's director and producer Edward Barnes and Biddy Baxter bought a similar-looking replacement puppy, which was subsequently named Petra by the viewers.Nick Allen \\"Petra the Blue Peter dog was a fake\\", telegraph.co.uk, 1 September 2008 Patch Patch (9 September 1965 - 1971) was looked after by presenter John Noakes after Noakes joined the programme in December 1965. Patch had a distinctive marking around one of his eyes, giving him his name. Patch died in May 1971. Shep Shep (1971‚Äì1987), a border collie, is widely considered to be the most famous Blue Peter pet; he was bought by the BBC to replace Patch, one of Petra's puppies, born in 1965. He became the main Blue Peter dog when Petra died in 1977. Shep was bred by Audrey Wickham (n√©e Hart), breeder of a number of notable pedigree border collies in the Sadghyl line. He is remembered by viewers as being inseparable from Blue Peter presenter John Noakes. Shep was excitable, and Noakes would often have to restrain him. Noakes's common refrain, \\"Get down Shep!\\", became a catchphrase, and The Barron Knights released a song with that title. Shep left Blue Peter when Noakes departed in June 1978. Shep also appeared with Noakes in six series of Go with Noakes, from 1976 to 1980. Noakes left Blue Peter on 26 June 1978. and the BBC offered to let him keep Shep, as the dog had lived with him since his TV debut. Despite Shep living with Noakes, the dog was always legally owned by the BBC and in rules that also applied to himself whilst under contract to the BBC, he could not use Shep for advertising or commercial purposes.Baxter, Biddy. Blue Peter: The Inside Story. Interpet Ringpull BBC Books 1989. Noakes was paid a stipend to cover all Shep's costs from the Blue Peter budget (as was Peter Purves for Petra and later Simon Groom for Goldie) and as part of the agreement to keep Shep after leaving the show, Noakes agreed to the no- advertising condition to remain. However, shortly after leaving the show, Noakes was furious to discover that what he called his \\"dog money\\" ceased to be paid and he confronted Biddy Baxter in a phone call. Baxter was adamant that since Shep had left Blue Peter, the programme should no longer be responsible for any of Shep's costs, although she did sympathise with some of his argument and felt that the BBC should pay Noakes for Shep to appear in Go With Noakes or for 'personal appearances' the dog made. Regardless, she later wrote that Noakes was too angry to discuss the matter and the two rarely spoke again. Soon after this angry confrontation, Noakes relinquished Shep, who went to live with Edith Menzies. Noakes subsequently appeared in a series of television advertisements for Spillers \\"Choice Cuts\\" dog food, using a dog that was indistinguishable from Shep but named Skip. The subterfuge led to a deeper rift between Noakes and Baxter.Baxter, Biddy (1989), Blue Peter The Inside Story, Interpet Ringpull BBC Books; Shep died on 17 January 1987. Goldie Goldie was a female Golden Retriever dog who appeared on Blue Peter from 1978 to 1986. She was owned by presenter Simon Groom. She made her first appearance on the show as a puppy and was named by viewers of Blue Peter. She went on to appear with 8 other presenters and began the long list of golden retrievers to appear on the show. In early 1986, Goldie went on to have puppies and one of them, Bonnie, went on to become a Blue Peter dog after Goldie left. She left along with Simon Groom later that year and lived to 14. Goldie is buried on Simon's farm in Derbyshire. She is also featured as the mascot for UK Gold and featured on idents which were kept until 1993, when they were replaced with a form-up of the first logo against a blue background. A re-branding in 1994 saw UK Gold adopt idents based on the forging of gold bars, with the station's logo appearing to have been stamped into gold. Variations on this theme were used until 1997, when the channel received a revamp as part of the formation of the UKTV network. Bonnie Bonnie (3 February 1986 ‚Äì 17 April 2001) was a female golden retriever dog who appeared on Blue Peter in the late 1980s and 1990s. She was the daughter of Goldie, and succeeded her mother as the Blue Peter dog. Bonnie appeared in 1,150 editions of the programme, alongside 16 different presenters, until she retired in 1999 to live with Leonie Pocock, her off-screen owner. Bonnie died at the age of 15 in 2001. Mabel Mabel (born c. 1996 - 4 May 2011) was a Blue Merle Border Collie and was Blue Peter's second longest serving dog after Petra being on the show for more than 14 years. Mabel was rescued by the RSPCA who found her in South East London in 1996. She was about six months old when she joined Blue Peter. Her name was derived from the label on her RSPCA kennel, MAB1. Mabel was noticeable for having heterochromatic eyes (one blue and one brown) and distinctive ears. As Mabel's exact date of birth is unknown, her birthday was celebrated on 3 February, the same day as former Blue Peter dog Bonnie. On 10 March 2010 it was announced that Mabel would be retiring from the show after 14 years. Mabel retired on 30 March 2010, and died on 4 May 2011. Lucy Lucy (22 February 1998 ‚Äì April 2011) was a Blue Peter pet for 12 years. A pedigree Golden Retriever she was born to Laytoncroft India of Highbrae (mother) and Lilling Dessie (father). She famously once wandered into Paul O'Grady's dressing room and was scared off by his dog. On 4 April 2011, it was announced that Lucy had died, aged 13, following a struggle with cancer. Meg Meg (born c. 2000 - 15 June 2011) was a Border Collie who belonged to presenter Matt Baker. Whilst not considered an official Blue Peter pet, as she lived with Baker's family in County Durham and was trained as a sheepdog, she frequently appeared on the show alongside Baker during his tenure as a Blue Peter presenter. Her highlights whilst on the show included demonstrating her sheepdog skills and giving birth to a litter of puppies. Meg left with Matt Baker in 2006, but has also appeared in other television programmes he has been involved in, including the BBC's 2007 coverage of Crufts, Countryfile and even a barking part in The Archers. There is also a model of Meg at the Jorvik Centre in York, made from a cast of the pet. Meg died on 15 June 2011 aged 11; she was the first Blue Peter dog whose death was not mentioned on the programme. Barney Barney is believed to be an Irish Setter/Dachshund cross and officially joined the Blue Peter team on 22 September 2009. He is the show's ninth dog. Barney is a former stray and was given to presenter Helen Skelton by the Dogs Trust.\\"Meet the new Blue Peter dog: a stray named Barney\\", Telegraph Online, 21 September 2009 Barney left the show along with his owner Helen on 26 September 2013.  Henry  Henry, a beagle/basset hound cross, made his first appearance on the show on 4 April 2019 and is the current Blue Peter dog. He was rescued from Dogs Trust when he was two years old. He is excitable and sometimes has to walk off set because of his desire to play. Henry is owned by a member of the Blue Peter production team, called Michelle.  Guide dogs: Honey, Cindy, Button, Prince, Magic and Iggy  The programme has had a long association with guide dogs, which stretches back to 1964 ‚Äì captivating millions of viewers and helping to transform the lives of thousands of visually impaired people. The first Blue Peter guide dog puppy was Honey, whose training was charted by Valerie Singleton on the programme in 1964. Since then there has been Cindy, who was puppy walked by Peter Purves in 1968; Buttons, who was featured in the mid-1970s, Prince, a son of Goldie, whose training was followed by Peter Duncan in 1981 and most recently a second pup called Honey ‚Äì named in honour of her predecessor ‚Äì who was trained by presenter John Leslie during 1991. In 2006 Andy Akinwolere began puppy walking a new Blue Peter guide dog puppy, named by viewers as Magic. Magic had epilepsy and could not complete her Guide Dog training, so she was re-homed.Blue Peter - Magic In June 2014, presenter Lindsey Russell started to train a new guide dog called Iggy. Iggy successfully completed her guide dog training and left the show on 12 May 2016 to join her new owner, Callum. Cats Helen Skelton and Socks the cat Jason Jason (3 May 1964 ‚Äì January 1976) was the first Blue Peter cat. He was a Seal Point Siamese who joined after appearing on an episode with his mother, brother and sister at just three weeks old. He was named by a viewer who was a resident of Jasons Hill in Botley, Buckinghamshire, although the name had become popularised by the recent release of the film 'Jason and the Argonauts'. Possibly Jason's finest hour came in December 1975 when he played the part of the Cheshire Cat in the show's Christmas production, \\"Alice in Blue Peter Land\\". With a voice remarkably similar to that of John Noakes, Jason snootily pointed out he was a Siamese cat before disappearing. Jason lived until January 1976. Jack Jack (29 January 1976 ‚Äì 20 April 1986) was a silver striped tabby and the brother of Jill who made his television debut with his sister just three weeks after they were born. Jack and Jill became known as Blue Peters disappearing cats, for whenever they appeared on screen they tended to leap out of a presenter's lap. The production team put together a sequence of clips demonstrating this, featuring various moments when the cats leapt out of sight. It was set to the theme of the cartoon Top Cat, and was often requested by viewers as the clip they most wanted to see again. Jack died suddenly in 1986 at 10 years old. Jill Jill (29 January 1976 ‚Äì 30 May 1983) was a silver spotted tabby and the sister of Jack. She often appeared with her brother, famously leaping out of presenter's laps whenever on screen. On 15 May 1980 Jill gave birth to two kittens who appeared with their mother on the show on 23 June. Jill died of heart failure in 1983 at 7 years old. Willow Willow first appeared on Blue Peter in September 1986 as a replacement to Jack, who had died a few months earlier. Viewers were asked to send in their suggestions for a name, and the name Willow was chosen, probably because of the kitten's oriental looks. Rather than follow Willow's progress as a mother, it was decided that she should be the first pet to be spayed. This decision was taken because of the vast numbers of unwanted pets destroyed by the RSPCA every year. Willow retired from the programme in 1991 to live in Sussex. Kari and Oke Kari and Oke were rescued as kittens and placed in the care of Wood Green Animal Shelters in Heydon, Cambridgeshire. Oke was found abandoned in a bush and the staff of the centre set about the tricky task of trying to encourage Kari's mother to adopt Oke. The plan worked and the pair became brother and sister. Six weeks after being rescued, they made their Blue Peter debut. They were named after John Leslie and Diane- Louise Jordan's Summer Expedition to Japan in 1991, where they performed karaoke. Kari and Oke retired from the programme in 2004, shortly after their 13th birthday. Kari died in 2006 at the age of 15; Oke died in mid-2011, aged 20. Smudge Smudge was one of the shortest serving Blue Peter pets. First seen on-screen in September 2004, Smudge was named as a kitten by the viewers and was one of the most popular kittens on the show, but died in 2005 from the injuries sustained after being hit by a car. Socks Socks (born 29 November 2005, Hertfordshire) is a ragdoll cat, who first appeared on the show on 9 January 2006 as Smudge's replacement.Blue Peter - Socks Socks is known for having been at the centre of a scandal on the show after the programme's producers falsified the result of a viewer vote to choose the cat's name. Viewers had selected the name Cookie, but producers changed the result to Socks. Both Socks and Cookie stopped appearing regularly on the show after it moved to Salford in September 2011, and left permanently in October 2013 as it was felt that the journey from London, where they lived, was too far. Cookie Cookie was introduced to the show on 25 September 2007 following the scandal caused by the change of Socks' name. Cookie left in October 2013 along with Socks; replacements have not been found yet. Tortoises=Freda Freda was the first Blue Peter tortoise. She made her debut on 21 October 1963 and lived to April 1979. She was originally thought to be a male and was called Fred, but renamed when it was realised she was female. Freda is best remembered for her appearances each year when she was brought onto the show and placed into a cardboard box to hibernate over the harsh British winter. Maggie and Jim Maggie and Jim (27 August 1974 ‚Äì January 1982) were brother and sister who made their first appearance in 1974 and joined the show on a regular basis in 1979, after the death of Freda. They were named after Margaret Thatcher and James Callaghan, both prime ministers of that year. The two did not survive the cold winter of January 1982. George George (circa 1920 ‚Äì 10 May 2004) was a Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise who first appeared on the programme in 1982 and holds the title of longest serving Blue Peter pet. Originally named Pork Pie, viewers renamed him George. In 1988 George caused a scare when the home where he was kept had a break-in and he went missing. Thinking he had been killed, the production team broadcast a special tribute film about him, but George was found by a neighbour walking her dog some days later. George made his last appearance on the show on 14 April 2004, and his death was announced on 10 May 2004. Shelley Shelley (hatched c. 1985, Morocco) is a female Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise who first appeared on the programme in 2004 as a friend to George and then became the only tortoise on the show after his death. Parrots=Joey Joey, an African Grey, was the first of two parrots to appear on Blue Peter during the 1960s with Petra, Patch, and Jason. In a 1986 documentary shown on BBC2 as part of the Did You See...? series, former presenter Peter Purves recalled that Biddy Baxter, the show's editor, had called him in floods of tears the day Joey had died. Amazon parrots have the potential to live for about 60 years; nevertheless, having a parrot as one of the pets on the programme was discontinued in the 1960s. Barney Barney was the second and final Blue Peter parrot, brought into the programme in the 1960s after the death of the previous parrot, Joey. When Barney died, he was not replaced.

The ride is based on an interpretation of the local legend of the Chained Oak Tree and is set within the restored ruins of the Towers themselves. Description Hex tells the story of the Chained Oak Tree, a legend based on the towers themselves. The story has been a local legend for years, but was slightly altered in the ride to make the attraction more appealing. The legend says that the 15th Earl of Shrewsbury was cursed by an old beggarwoman to suffer a death in the family every time a branch fell from the old oak tree. Hex's version embellishes the end of the 'original' tale with the Earl experimenting on one of the fallen branches in a vault deep within the Towers themselves, and it is this vault, with its entrance bricked up behind a bookcase, that has supposedly been sealed up for two centuries and only recently discovered during renovation work. This is explained in several scenes during the experience. This attraction was closed for the duration of the 2016 season, but underwent repairs in the winter before reopening in 2017. Ride experience=Armoury and cinema The attraction starts in the real armoury of the Towers, decorated with scaffolding and artefacts, which starts to tell the story of the renovation and the discovery of the vault, through video screens found along the twisting atmospheric queue-line. Statues draped in dust sheets decorate plinths high up near the darkened ceiling and sound- effects of chiselling can be heard to give the suggestion that this renovation is currently ongoing and unfinished. At the end of the queue line is a large painting of the Earl hung on the wall, and visitors hear a short narrative which gives a brief introduction to the legend before they are shown onwards into the cinema area (still part of the real building) where visitors watch a short film which dramatises the legend and makes it clear that they will soon be visiting the recently discovered vault where the original branch is located. Octagon From the cinema area, guests are let through into the Octagon (still part of the real building) - a large dimly lit eight-sided hall containing more scaffolding and dust-sheets, draped curtains and a whirring generator high on a wall - and are led to believe that the story will be told further through more video screens. However, the generator suddenly 'blows', causing the lights and the video screens to fail and the room is plunged into semi-darkness. A wind picks up, causing the drapes to billow, and the ghostly cursing of the beggarwoman can be heard, along with the loud crash of a falling branch and the sound of horse's hooves. An apparition can be briefly seen in an alcove. To add to the suspense, the noise of the crashing branch is synchronised with a light water spray falling from the ceiling onto the guests below. The generator restarts and the words ‚Äúa vault sealed for two centuries‚Äú can be heard. The lighting comes back on and a curtain rises to allow guests to move up a small staircase, past the bookcase and into the next section of the attraction. Vault At this point, the guests are moving from the original building up into the specially constructed part of the ride, but due to the careful continuation of theming, it is difficult to tell where this occurs. They turn to the left past the bookcase and along a short, low- ceilinged 'stone' corridor - once again similarly decorated to the rest of the attraction - where they wait at two doors for entry into the vault. The scaffolding running along the corridor discourages the guests from getting close enough to touch the walls, as although the previous show areas in the building are real original stone, the walls of this 'stone' section are fibreglass cladding, which sounds hollow when tapped. The vault itself is a large hall-like structure, with the decorative ceiling supported by stone pillars, and shelves containing dusty artefacts lit with flickering candles. It contains the branch itself, chained to a long ledge that runs along the middle of the room, two rows of lap-bar benches that face the branch and a large machine, covered in lights and dials, which the Earl supposedly used in his experiments, which is located up against the far wall and wired to one end of the branch. The lap-bars are lowered and checked by two staff members, who then leave the vault. The machine starts whirring, the lights flash, smoke starts to pour from the branch, atmospheric music begins and the ride starts. Riders gradually experience an odd sense of movement, even though nothing in the vault appears to be moving - with riders on one side feeling as if they're being pulled away from the branch and on the other feeling as if they're being pushed towards the branch. The benches then begin, almost imperceptibly at first, to swing back and forth relative to the room. The benches feel to be swinging higher and higher in each direction until finally they seem to perform a series of full rotations, with what was the floor rotating fully above the rider‚Äôs heads; the riders feel as if they are being repeatedly turned upside down. As the music and the sensation reaches a crescendo, a mass of roots become visible on the 'floor' above ‚Äì or is it below? ‚Äì the disoriented riders' heads. The branch is lit as if to suggest an evil face with illuminated red eyes and the branch twinkles with fibre-optics before gradually the benches and vault return to their starting positions and the ride is over. =Mechanism= The sensory illusion exploits a number of tricks. The longitudinal benches are mounted on a platform that can swing back and forth within the vault. The pivot mechanism for the benches is hidden by the Earl's machine at one end of the room and a large cabinet at the other. The benches are mounted on the platform angled backward by 20 degrees; riders effectively face slightly upward at rest. During the ride, the platform rotates back and forth by 15 degrees in each direction. This means that at full forward tilt, benches are in fact at 5 degrees forward to horizontal; this minimises the tendency to slip off the bench into the lap restraint. At full backward tilt, the bench is at 45 degrees to horizontal which accentuates the sensory effect. The vault itself is actually a large, 6-sided drum which can rotate through a full 360 degrees. All of the room scenery is mounted on the inner surface of this drum. At the beginning of the ride, both the benches and the vault are slowly moving back and forth in unison. This is what gives the impression of pushing toward and pulling away from the branch. As the ride progresses, the bench platform continues to swing back and forth by 15 degrees in each direction, while the vault rotation gradually becomes out of unison and increases to give the impression of increasing height and ultimately it turns through a full rotation to give the sensation of inversion. All of this relies on the brain‚Äôs over-interpretation of visual inputs in the presence of relatively minor vestibular system inputs; the same principle is used to give the sensation of acceleration and deceleration in full-motion simulators. The lighting also subtly changes from moment to moment to add to the disorientation. Reception Initially the response to Hex was mixed, as many guests had mistakenly been expecting a roller coaster inside the Towers, with Oblivion and Nemesis having opened in recent years. However, after some adjustment to the attraction in 2000, response for Hex changed drastically and the ride proved consistently popular. It is now perceived as one of the best dark rides in the UK, praised for its theatrical and respectful use of the Towers ruins. http://www.themeparktourist.com/features/20111211/5474/top-5-dark-rides-uk References Category:Amusement rides introduced in 2000 Category:Dark rides Category:Amusement rides manufactured by Vekoma Category:2000 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Alton Towers ","title":"Hex ‚Äì The Legend of the Towers"},{"id":"13373694","text":"Spice Williams-Crosby (born Marceline Ann Williams, April 26, 1952) is an American actress and stunt performer, with a career in film and television which spans over twenty years.

The boundaries of the neighborhood are East 16th Street on the south, East 22nd Street on the north, the alley west of North Pennsylvania on the west, and Central Avenue on the east. History=19th century In 1859, the state purchased the land, which was still largely undeveloped, as a home for the Indiana State Fair. At the start of the American Civil War, the area was used first as an induction center for the Indiana Volunteer Infantry, and later as the prisoner of war camp for Confederates, Camp Morton. After the Civil War, Indiana reclaimed the land to use as fairgrounds. The area was then platted for residential development in 1890 and the city's elite began building elaborate homes in the area soon after. 20th century At the beginning of the 20th century, the district directly north of 16th Street was one of Indianapolis‚Äô most elegant residential neighborhoods. Morton Place, named for Indiana governor Oliver Morton, was home to many celebrated politicians, physicians, business leaders, and artists. Indiana Impressionist artists T.C. Steele and William Forsyth founded their famed Hoosier Group art school in Morton Place in 1888. In 1895 John Herron's bequest founded the John Herron Art Institute, and funded new construction of a new main building and an art museum in Morton Place. The Herron Museum later became the Indianapolis Museum of Art. The Morton Place neighborhood thrived until the Great Depression in the 1930s. Throughout the 1930s and World War II, many houses were subdivided into apartments. In the 1950s through 1970s many houses were lost to fire or demolition. In 1983, Herron‚ÄìMorton Place Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and became a historic preservation district in 1986. It encompasses 574 contributing buildings an representative examples of Classical Revival, Queen Anne, and Tudor Revival style architecture. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs 21st century The present day Herron School of Art and Design, the preeminent art school in Indiana, relocated to new buildings on the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis campus in 2000 and 2005. The original Herron School of Art buildings now house Herron High School, a classical liberal arts charter high school. They are historic district contributing properties to the HMPHD. The Willard and Josephine Hubbard House was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Community Since 1950, Herron‚ÄìMorton Place has hosted the Talbot Street Art Fair, an annual juried art fair held on Talbott Street in June of each year. The Herron‚ÄìMorton Place Neighborhood Association was formed in 1976 to spearhead the renovation of home, encourage new residential development, reduce crime, and rebuild community spirit. The Herron‚ÄìMorton Place Neighborhood Foundation raises funds to maintain a historic neighborhood park (located on the 1900 block of Alabama Street) and other beautification efforts throughout the neighborhood. The Foundation plans several events each year that raise money for the neighborhood park, most notable are the annual Oktoberfest in late September and bi-annual home tour and Rock 'N' Romp a yearly event for families.

There used to be a short branch line leading from Stoke Junction to the coastal town of Allhallows but this closed from 4 December 1961, the same date on which the Hundred of Hoo line was closed to passenger services.  Early history = Authorisation  The first authorisation to construct a railway on the Hoo Peninsula was obtained by a group of local businessmen who sponsored the passing of the North Kent Railway Extension Railway Act in 1865 which provided for the construction of a branch line leaving the South Eastern Railway's Gravesend - Strood line near Shorne Marshes. The line would head eastwards across land north of Cliffe to reach Allhallows, continuing to the Isle of Grain. However, the major railway companies operating in the area, South Eastern Railway (SER) and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) were not interested in the project and as a result it failed to secure the necessary funding. The opening of Queenborough railway station on 15 May 1876 by the LCDR which offered a sea link to the Dutch town of Flushing prompted the SER to investigate possibilities for a rival link to the continent. On 16 April 1878 the SER's engineer, Francis Brady, reported back to his employer on the feasibility of constructing a railway from a point near Gravesend and the North Kent Line to the village of Stoke, a distance of 9 miles. The estimated cost was ¬£72,000. A 5% return was projected, the belief being that Gravesend's proximity to London would make it a more desirable outlet for the distribution of goods intended for the Kent area, rather than the LCDR's Chatham station. The Hundred of Hoo Railway Company was therefore formed and a second authorisation for the line obtained in the form of the Hundred of Hoo Railway Act which received royal assent on 21 July 1879.  Extension to Port Victoria  Seizing the opportunity to provide a sea outlet for goods to Europe, the SER announced its intention to open a new port on the Isle of Grain with a service to Belgium. This new service would compete with the LCDR's own Queenborough and Sheerness outlets. The SER was hopeful that its service would be preferred over that of the LCDR, the proposed route from Charing Cross to the new port was 40 miles, some 12 miles less than the LCDR's Victoria to Queenborough or Sheerness service. The Hundred of Hoo Railway (Extension) Act was passed by the House of Lords on 14 July 1880 authorising an extension of 3 miles from Stoke to the new Victoria Port where a pier would be constructed. Following a call for tenders, the quotation of a certain Thomas A. Walker was accepted, he having proposed ¬£14,421 for the railway extension (including a bridge over Higham Canal) and ¬£18,953 for the pier. The Railway Company was absorbed into SER in August 1880.  Opening and initial services  A single track line as far as Sharnal Street opened on Friday 31 March 1882. The remainder of the line to Port Victoria officially opened on Monday 11 September 1882. When the line opened, the scope for passenger services was limited - the entire population of the sparsely populated Hoo Peninsula was only 3,405. Nevertheless, in October 1891 there were 9 daily trains, approximately one every two hours from 6am on weekdays and Saturdays, and three on Sundays. The total journey time was 1 hour. Down trains would depart from Gravesend and call at Sharnal Street and Port Victoria, before a steamer would take passengers across the River Medway on to Sheerness. From Sheerness passengers could take the Medway Ferry Service to Folkestone and then on to the continent. The ferry service was intermittent. It was discontinued in 1895 due to dwindling returns and then reinstated some years later; when there was no service to Port Victoria, trains terminated at Sharnal Street. The initial returns for the line as a whole were below expectations: without a direct ferry connection to the continent there was little to attract customers to this remote region. Nevertheless, the farming community on Hoo took well to the new railway and Sharnal Street station saw good business.  New stations  By 1906 it had become clear that Port Victoria would not develop into a major continental sea port and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) began to look for new opportunities to bring in revenue. In July of that year seven wooden halts were constructed: Milton Road, Milton Range, Denton, Uralite, Beluncle, Middle Stoke and Grain Crossing. Uralite halt was named after the nearby British Uralite plc complex which had opened in 1899 and manufactured drainage pipes from wet asbestos paste. On 1 May 1915, the little-used Milton Road Halt was closed. The branch line to Allhallows-on-sea was opened on 16 May 1932 followed on 17 July 1932 by opening of another halt at Stoke Junction. A new station opened at Grain on 3 September 1951, replacing Grain Crossing Halt, which closed to rail traffic on 11 July 1951 and passengers on 3 September 1951 - a bus service being provided between those dates. Grain Halt Station postcard  Port Victoria and pier  Royal Train en route to Port Victoria, 19 May 1913  Construction  Port Victoria station was located at the head of the long pier. Ships of up to draught were able to draw-up alongside to take passengers and goods, irrespective of the tides, thanks to the pier's deep water front. A 'temporary' hotel was constructed near the pier at a cost of ¬£1,900. The station became popular with the Royal Family because it was secluded with no roads leading to the port. Both the Royal Train and the Royal Yacht were regular visitors to the line.  Maintenance  In 1896 it was discovered that the pier needed urgent remedial works, marine worms having infested the wooden piles. Extensive works were undertaken only for the pier to be damaged again, this time by a heavy storm on 28 November 1896. Further repairs were necessary and the service to Victoria Port became intermittent, closing in the winter months with trains terminating at Sharnal Halt. In 1901 the wooden piles of the pier were encased in concrete in an attempt to prevent further infestation, but problems continued after the area around the pier was dredged, thereby exposing the uncased parts of the piers to investigation.  1899-1918  Following the merger of the SER and LCDR in 1899, Port Victoria found itself firmly in second place behind Queenborough for traffic to the continent. It was only when Queenborough was unavailable that Port Victoria saw regular sustained use. This was the case when a fire caused serious damage to Queenborough on 19 July 1900 and services were diverted via Port Victoria for the best part of the next three years - the busiest period in its history. Following the outbreak of the First World War, the Admiralty took over Port Victoria on 11 August 1914 at a rent of ¬£200 per annum for a lease of 14 years. A siding to Yantlet Creek was laid and artillery testing was carried out there. The Royal Naval Air Service took over the Royal Corinthian Yacht Club's headquarters which were located near the pier.  Decline  As the popularity of the new extension to Allhallows, opened in 1932, began to grow, the further decline of Port Victoria became ever more pronounced. During the 1930s, it saw only two trains per day, mainly for the workmen at the refineries on the Isle of Grain - the Medway Oil and Storage Company had been based at Elphinstone Point at the entrance to Colemouth Creek since 1923. Nevertheless, the Flushing Night Mail continued to dock at the port. In 1932 further concerns about the stability of the pier led to the buffer being brought further forward so that only of railway covered the pier. The station was replaced the same year by a modest structure at a cost of ¬£395. The following year the old station buildings on the pier were demolished and new fencing was erected to create a gangway on the pier in order to provide access to the navigation lights. The 1930s also saw the demolition of the old Royal Corinthian Yacht Club. The end finally came in 1941 when its seaward end (measuring some ) was demolished and sold for scrap to the Admiralty for ¬£841 5s. Only a short length at the shore end now remained. Both Port Victoria Station and the previous station, Grain Crossing Halt, closed to rail traffic (but not passengers) on 11 June 1951. A new station, called \\"Grain\\", which became the line's terminus, was constructed in their place. The Port Victoria Hotel was one of the last pier buildings to be swept away in 1951.  Extension to Allhallows = Historical context  With the failure of Port Victoria to become the valuable European seaport that had been expected, alternative means of increasing the revenue from the line were sought. Such an opportunity seemed to present itself in the early 1920s with the popularity of seaside resorts as holiday destinations for middle and working-class families with the financial means to take an annual holiday or weekend breaks. Resorts such as Brighton, Torquay and Blackpool had long been popular with seasiders since the mid-19th century, but it was only with the arrival of the railway that factory workers in London could enjoy the privileges previously reserved for the richer classes and use their free weekends to escape from their urban environment. The Southern Railway (SR), which had taken over the SECR's activities in 1923 following the grouping ordered by the Railways Act 1921, sought to profit from this new market by offering a seaside destination within easy reach of London which would rival the London, Midland and Scottish Railway's line to Southend-on-Sea. The small village of Allhallows, population 261 in the 1880s, was identified as the only feasible location for a new seaside resort in North Kent - Herne Bay being judged too far from London and Leysdown-on-Sea on the Isle of Sheppey not having a direct rail service.  Authorisation and construction  In June 1929, a Ministry of Transport railway order was obtained by the SR and construction began in August 1931. The branch line to Allhallows was 1¬æ miles long, joining the existing line between Middle Stoke and Grain Crossing Halts. Like the line to Port Victoria, the connection with Allhallows would also consist of a single track. An article published in April 1932 in the Southern Railway Magazine indicated the SR's aspirations for the line: \\"[n]ear the small village of Allhallows, amid fields where cattle graze and the ploughman walks his furrow, workmen are busy constructing roads and laying the main drains and conduits for the gas, water, telephone and electric light services to houses of which not a brick has yet been laid. In contrast to the urban development of an earlier day, the prospective house-purchaser (and season-ticket holder) at Allhallows will approach his future home from a modern reinforced concrete carriageway, instead of stumbling through the ruts of an unmade road.\\" The Allhallows-on- Sea Estate Company was incorporated with the intention of transforming the flat, featureless, windswept marshland in the area into a new holiday resort. The SR had a financial interest in the new company and worked closely with it in the construction of the line. The new company 'donated' land for use as railway and contributed ¬£20,000 towards the construction of the line.  Opening and early days  Southern Railway promotional poster c1932 The ceremonial opening of the extension took place on Whit Saturday 14 May 1932 when 700 day-trippers made the journey to Allhallows on a special train laid on from London drawn by SECR R1 Class 0-4-4T No. 380. The first passenger trains ran on the following bank holiday Monday, 16 May, with local trains starting from and returning to Gravesend Central. Cheap day return tickets from Charing Cross were offered at 5s 3d - the cheapest ticket to a Kentish seaside resort. To coincide with the opening of the new connection, other parts of the line were upgraded. At Stoke Junction, where the line to Allhallows branched off, a new halt was opened on 17 July 1932. At Cliffe and Sharnal Street, platforms were constructed, whilst at Uralite, High Halstow, Beluncle and Middle Stoke halts, concrete platforms replaced the timber ones. Two daily express services from Allhallows to Charing Cross were laid on at 7.36am and 8.28am, returning in the early evenings on weekdays and at midday on Saturdays, as if to demonstrate the village's potential as a commuter hub. The services were hardly used, the envisaged commuter town not having yet been constructed, and the SR ran them until September, planning to re-introduce them permanently when the town was ready. The line became increasingly popular for daytrips: on Sundays during July, August and September 1934 alone, 72,557 passengers used the line, compared with 62,120 for the same period in 1933. On Bank Holiday Sunday 5 August 1934, over 9,500 passengers made the journey to and from Allhallows. It became necessary to double the line between Allhallows and Stoke Junction, the single platform at Allhallows becoming an island with an extended platform canopy. The platform at Allhallows could accommodate ten- coach trains, and goods facilities were provided in the shape of goods sidings, a large goods shed and a turntable - none of which saw much use. By 1939 between ten and twelve trains were laid on each way on weekdays from Gravesend, and there was an excursion from Maze Hill in August. On Sundays, seven trains were provided, with six extra during the peak holiday season.  Decline  Allhallows's popularity continued up until the outbreak of the Second World War, with 12 trains making the journey to and from Gravesend during weekdays while extra services were laid on for Sundays - 14 down and 11 up. At this time the SR considered electrification of the entire Hundred of Hoo line but ultimately decided against it. Looking back now, there is now little doubt that, had this been done, Allhallows would finally have developed into the resort and/or commuter town that had been expected. In the frugal years that followed the end of the war, Allhallows, like Leysdown-on-Sea, began to experience lean times as passenger numbers fell. Allhallows with its single Charrington's pub, concrete road, two small refreshment stands (closed in winter) and block of four small shops (which never saw any real use and were eventually bricked up) was no match for Brighton, the attractions of which could be enjoyed by rail for an extra 1s 9d when compared to the price of an Allhallows ticket (then 5s 9d). In an attempt to stem losses, the new operator, British Railways (Southern Region) (BR), misguidedly tried out an ACV lightweight diesel railcar in late 1953, its noise and general lack of comfort probably serving however to drive away more passengers. In the February 1954 edition of Trains Illustrated, T.J. Norris noted that many of the trains from Allhallows carried a score or so of passengers, most of whom went only as far as Cliffe. Whilst Summer and bank holidays saw some patronage of the line - an excursion train from London ran three days each week, with extra trains on Sundays and bank holidays, Winter presented a different picture with trains continuing beyond Sharnal Street being almost completely empty. Nevertheless, BR still tried to promote the area for holiday-makers and potential residents as its Holiday Haunts guide for 1955 demonstrates: \\"[t]he open fields, the views, the sands and the safe bathing attract may day and weekend visitors. Undoubtedly, Allhallows has a future; roads have been laid out and it is certain that the place will develop as a pleasant, rural type of resort.\\" By 1955 eleven trains ran each way on weekdays, with twelve down and thirteen up on Saturdays and thirteen up and down on Sundays. In 1957, the line between Stoke Junction and Allhallows was reduced to a single track and in 1959, the Hundred of Hoo line was excluded from the Kent Coast electrification programme which saw the North Kent Line electrified. In line with the 1955 Modernisation Plan, by 1961 most passenger trains on the branch were diesel powered, although some were still operated by SECR H class 0-4-4T steam locomotives.  Closure  Proposal = In Winter 1959/60, against a background of a continuing drop in passenger numbers, a study was undertaken to determine the actual numbers using the line and the savings to be made by closing it to passenger traffic. The results showed that 321 passengers per day were using the Allhallows line to travel to and from Gravesend, and that a saving of ¬£25,500 per year would be made, were the line closed. In March 1960 the proposed withdrawal of passenger services was announced, the main line from Gravesend to Grain remaining unaffected by the changes. The closure proposal was rejected by the South Eastern Area Transport Users Consultative Committee, whose consent was required in accordance with the Transport Act 1947, on the basis that replacement bus services would be inadequate. A new proposal was made by BR a few months later, which it backed up with new figures showing that passenger numbers had further declined since Winter 1959/60 and that savings would even higher - ¬£43,324 per annum. = Opposition = Objections were made against the closure, notably from the Kent County Council and Strood Rural District Council which challenged BR's method of calculating passenger numbers and losses. They argued that the figures (i) failed to consider cheaper methods of running the line such as using diesel traction units, closing minor halts, eliminating unnecessary journeys, the operation of direct summer excursions from London to Allhallows and the combination of passenger and goods services, (ii) took into account costs incurred for the line between Gravesend and Grain which would remain open for freight, (iii) included a figure of ¬£5,000 which would be paid to Maidstone & District Motor Services for replacement bus services, (iv) failed to take into account holiday traffic - 2,812 passengers having used Allhallows on the Whitsun holiday of 3/6 June 1960, and (v) failed to record the 25% increase in passenger numbers or take into account the ongoing residential development in the area. It was also pointed out that the four replacement bus services - routes 17 (Gillingham - Cliffe, hourly), 19 and 65 (Gillingham - Grain, every 80 mins) and 47 (Gravesend to Cliffe, 10 per day) - were inadequate and would cause hardship to the local community as their timings would not allow passengers the same the ease or flexibility of use as that offered by rail transport. For example, the journey time of workers going to Uralite Halt from Gravesend by rail was 6 minutes, as opposed to 29 minutes by bus, while the journey from Gravesend to Allhallows was 34 minutes by rail and 1 hour 16 minutes by bus. The buses would also be oversubscribed at peak-times by schoolchildren. = December 1960 meeting = A meeting was held on 15 December 1960 between representatives of BR, the Kent County Council (KCC), Maidstone & District Motor Services, British Uralite and Strood Rural District Council. BR outlined its case for closure, giving three main reasons: :(i) electrification of the Hundred of Hoo line with the exception of the Allhallows branch would leave this latter part as an isolated pocket of diesel activity which would be difficult to service and maintain, :(ii) replacement bus services would provide a reasonable alternative to trains, and :(iii) the Allhallows branch did not merit investment with capital from the Modernisation Programme owing to the minimal numbers of passengers using the line and the siting of stations away from residential areas. BR accepted that substituting the existing units with diesel rail buses would cut losses on the line, but argued that losses would not be completely eradicated and that rail buses would be unable to deal with Summer Sunday traffic. KCC, announcing its intention to resist the proposed closure \\"strongly\\", reminded BR that planning permission for the construction of 1,200 houses on the Isle of Grain had been granted, possibly leading to an extra 4,000 potential users of the line. This was dismissed by BR which believed that many of these users would work locally and not need the railway. KCC also pointed out that bus users would have to find an extra 1s 10d per day to travel by bus from Allhallows to Gravesend by comparison with rail travel (a cheap day fare being 3s 6d), and the increased journey times would mean that schoolchildren would be away from home for 10¬º hours per day (by bus) as opposed to 8¬æ hours (by train). British Uralite predicted that the region would undergo \\"substantial\\" industrial development in the future which would generate extra traffic and that the railway, once taken away, would never be put back. BR replied that ownership of the land between Stoke Junction and Allhallows would be retained for a period of 10 years so that it could be returned to railway, were circumstances to warrant it. = TUCC approval = In September 1960 the South Eastern Area Transport Users Consultative Committee (TUCC) approved the closure proposal on the basis of new financial information provided to them by BR. Objectors had no access to the figures used by BR to arrive at its conclusions, and there were suspicions that the TUCC was not acting as impartially as it should have done and was simply trying to find ways around the objections raised in order to facilitate BR's plans for the line. With regard to the difference in journey times from Allhallows to Gravesend caused by the withdrawal of rail services, the TUCC concluded that \\"this inconvenience is outweighed by the savings the Commission will make.\\" Peter Kirk, the Conservative MP for Gravesend, criticised the TUCC's handling of the matter and tried to discuss it with Ernest Marples, the Minister of Transport. A Ministry of Transport memorandum of 14 April 1961 states that \\"it would not be proper for the Minister to see Mr Kirk at this stage [...] It may well be that Mr Kirk wished to put forward further representations at this late stage [...] Mr Kirk may, for example, wish to make some criticism of the way in which the proposals have been heard by the Consultative Committees.\\" Access to the Minister was therefore refused. A further memorandum dated 9 June 1961 admitted that \\"no doubt there will be a comeback from Mr Kirk MP who clearly has views on the merits of the proposal as well as the procedure adopted by the Consultative Committees\\" but stated that \\"the sooner the passenger service is closed, the greater the economy will be for the Railways who must already have lost a substantial amount during the last six months of argument.\\" = Final decision = British Rail closure notice c1961 The announcement was made that passenger services on the line would cease as from Monday 4 December 1961, and that the last weekend of operation would be the 2/3 December. A number of enthusiasts turned out for the final days of operation and the Railway Magazine described the activity on the 10.32am Saturday morning service (an \\"H\\" class 0-4-4T 31324): \\"[...] practically every seat was occupied throughout the journey to Allhallows. Photographers were much in evidence, and at least one had come equipped with a cin√© camera and a portable tape recorder.\\" The last passenger train, hauled by C class 0-6-0 31689 formed of seven coaches, left Allhallows at 8.38pm on Sunday, 3 December. The last goods train had run the previous day. The reasons for the commercial failure of Allhallows were neatly described by F. Oliver Randall in the November 1956 edition of the Railway Observer: \\"[...] the place falls sadly between two stools in that it lacks the most commonplace amenities associated with a seaside resort, yet has completely lost the rural charm and remoteness which it must have [...] possessed prior to its attempted exploitation.\\" = Attempted revival = In 1974 a campaign was begun by Stoke Parish Council to re-open the line to passenger traffic. This proposal was opposed by BR on the grounds that as the line was single track only, a passenger service would interfere with the line's freight operations. There were also signalling complications.  New freight opportunities  The failure of Allhallows to develop as a viable seaside resort and of Port Victoria as a commercial seaport was offset to some extent by the development of the Hoo Peninsula as a centre of industry.  The Admiralty  The Admiralty had been based near Chattenden since 1891 where there was a School of Military Engineering and barracks. A narrow gauge track was laid between 1873 and 1905 - the Chattenden and Upnor Railway - to transport men and munitions to and from the School. An armament depot was constructed in 1902 in order to supply the fleet and in 1905 the narrow gauge track was extended northwards to connect with the Hundred of Hoo line at Sharnal Street. By the end of the 1920s the line saw regular freight services to and from the depot, a service which continued until the narrow gauge track was lifted in December 1965. Sidings near Medway Power Station  Oil refineries  The Second World War exposed weaknesses in Britain's industrial capacity, amongst which was the ability to process crude oil. Post-war governments looked to remedy this vulnerability and the Thames estuary was identified as the new location for this new industry. The first oil refinery on the Hoo Peninsula was opened at Kingsnorth by Berry Wiggins and Co. Ltd. in 1932. The refinery had its own standard gauge railway which connected with the line at Hoo Junction via a spur which was separated from the main line by a wooden gate. The Medway Oil and Storage Company (later Power Petroleum) had opened a depot on Grain in 1928, this had been acquired by Shell-Mex & BP Ltd in 1934. During the Second World War the terminal had served as the base of operations for Operation Pluto, a scheme to construct undersea oil pipelines under the English Channel between England and France. In 1948 work started on the construction of an oil refinery, then one of the largest in the country, on the Isle of Grain by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which became part of BP in 1956. By 1961 the site boasted more than 3,000 workers and could refine 11 million tons of crude oil per year. A new station, Grain, was opened on 3 September 1951 to serve the refinery (a concrete platform being installed for workers) and the line east of this halt, including Grain Crossing Halt and Port Victoria station, was closed and dismantled in order to make space for the refinery's coastal operations. The refineries generated significant goods traffic for the line.  APCM cement works  A cement industry had been established in the Cliffe area since 1860 when Francis and Co. opened the Nine Elms Cement Works on Cliffe Marsh, to the west of the village where the chalk cliffs came almost to within a mile of the River Thames. The site was taken over by the British Portland Cement Company in 1900 and works continued until 1920. In 1910 the Alpha Cement Works was constructed by the Thames Portland Cement Company. The site was exhausted by 1950 and was flooded as quarrying activities exceeded the depth of the water table. A second quarry was begun to the north of Salt Lane on the edge of the marshes. By the late 1950s the cement industry in the area was under the control of the APCM (Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers Ltd). A new siding was laid to serve the works (the APCM having switched the transport of their cement freight (around 1,000 tons per week) and delivery of coal from river and road to rail) which remained in use until 1969 when the chalk pits were again exhausted and flooded. In 1970 Marinex Gravel took over the site and used it as a base to receive gravel which had been dredged from the River Thames sea bed.  Cellactite and British Uralite Ltd  British Uralite was formed in 1899 and opened a factory at Higham the following year which manufactured drainage pipes from wet asbestos paste. The factory was served by its own station, Uralite Halt, which opened in 1906 and, although open to the public, was primarily intended for Uralite's workforce. The works have now closed and the site is part of the Canal Road Industrial Estate.  Foster Yeoman terminal  Foster Yeoman, a quarrying and asphalt company, opened an aggregates terminal using one of the refinery jetties at Grain in 1988 from which it could transport overseas the stone quarried at Glensanda near Oban. The firm had first been involved in the area during the construction of the Channel Tunnel for which it supplied stone. The terminal was part of the concrete works site of TransManche Link, the Anglo-French engineering consortium which took over the land formerly occupied by the BP refinery. The tunnel lining segments for the English side of the tunnel were manufactured here. The Grain terminal receives annually 2 million tonnes of stone by sea from Glensanda. The completion of the Channel Tunnel in 1994 led to the dissolution of TransManche Link, and the aggregates terminal continued to distribute material by rail, road or barge for use in south eastern construction projects, including the high speed one rail link, and as a major supplier of ballast for rail maintenance.  Thamesport  In 1990 Maritime Transport Services Ltd constructed a container port on the southern coastline of the Isle of Grain, taking over the area previously occupied by BP. In 1998 Thamesport was sold to Hutchison Ports (UK) which then sold it again in 2001 to Maritime Transport.  The route of the line = Gravesend to Port Victoria  Departing Gravesend Central, the line passes beneath a bridge carrying the A226 before reaching Milton Road Halt (). Here there is a road overbridge for Mark Lane (which was once a level crossing). The line then passes Denton Halt (), following the course of the Thames and Medway Canal before arriving at Milton Range Halt. This was originally intended to serve the nearby rifle range, but was more often used by railway workmen who used this desolate spot to leave their tools. Continuing onwards to Hoo Junction, the line forks: the North Kent Main Line continuing south-east to Higham and the Hundred of Hoo railway swinging leftwards onto a single track, arriving soon after at Uralite Halt (). The line now rises at a 1:120 (0.833%) gradient, passing over the Thames and Medway Canal and crossing Higham Marsh. Climbing on a 1:60 (1.67%) gradient, the line passes under two road bridges before reaching Cliffe () which was located over from the actual village. Departing Cliffe, the line rises again on a 1:190 (0.53%) gradient onto the embankment at Cooling Street, becoming a 1:66 (1.52%) gradient and then descending on a 1:160 (0.625%) gradient to Wyborne's farm siding and High Halstow Halt (). The next stop was Sharnal Street (), located from the nearest town, Hoo. Passing under a road bridge just outside the station, there was a connection with the Chattenden and Upnor Railway, a narrow gauge line. Descending on a 1:165 (0.61%) gradient, the line reaches Beluncle Halt () before passing under another bridge and continuing on a level towards Middle Stoke Halt (), located from Stoke Wharf. Nearly further on was Stoke Crossing (later to become Stoke Junction Halt) and its level crossing (). Heading gently southwards towards the River Medway and Port Victoria, the line crosses over Grain Bridge to reach the Isle of Grain. Here we have Grain Crossing Halt () together with its level crossing, later replaced by Grain (). Finally, the train would pull into its terminus - Port Victoria () where passengers would descend onto the wooden pier, walking down to the lower platform to board their ferry if the tide was out, or continuing to the end of the upper platform when the tide was in. The train would then be prepared for its return journey on the turntable just outside the pier.  Allhallows branch  The branch line to Allhallows () diverged from the main line to Port Victoria between Middle Stoke and Grain Crossing Halts and headed north for on an embankment averaging in height. The final was carried in a shallow cutting with a maximum depth of . The line terminated from the seashore, almost directly opposite Westcliff-on-Sea in Essex. The line encountered no major construction problems: for the greater part of its length it passed through low-lying pasture fields and ditches which necessitated the construction of ten culverts. The return journey from Allhallows generally saw the train continue as far as Stoke Junction where it would reverse to Grain before retracing its steps and continuing to Gravesend Central.  The line today  Brett Gravel works containers Although the Berry Wiggins refinery and APCM cement works closed in 1972 and the BP refinery in 1997, Grain remains an active railway terminal as the forwarding point for granite shipped from Scotland. The line is freight-only and services run from Monday to Friday, with occasional weekend enthusiasts excursions or Serco test trains. Approximately one train per hour runs on weekdays throughout the line. Currently the line sees use from: :(i) EWS and GB rail freight ballast from Foster Yeoman's aggregate terminal at Grain where an 08 shunter can usually be found, :(ii) Freightliner services to and from Thamesport Class 66s are predominantly to be seen on the line, with occasional sightings of 59s and 60s. One of the proposals for a Thames Estuary Airport is in the Isle of Grain area and the railway, given its gentle curvatures, could possibly be upgraded to support high-speed railway traffic, though this would probably involve electrification and double-tracking. In January 2019, Campaign for Better Transport identified the line was listed as Priority 2 for reopening, as it may support housing development sites in the Medway Council Local Plan. Priority 2 is for those lines which require further development or a change in circumstances (such as housing developments). p.42  Bibliography    References External links  *British Railways in 1960, Hoo Jn. to Allhallows-on-Sea *Cliffe-at-Hoo Historical Society Category:Rail transport in Kent Category:Railway lines in South East England Category:Railway companies established in 1879 Category:Railway lines opened in 1882 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1880 Category:Standard gauge railways in England Category:British companies established in 1879 ","title":"Hundred of Hoo Railway"},{"id":"13373866","text":"Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University (SRTMU) was established in 1994.

Diaphragms are typically horizontal, but can be sloped such as in a gable roof on a wood structure or concrete ramp in a parking garage. The diaphragm forces tend to be transferred to the vertical resisting elements primarily through in-plane shear stress. The most common lateral loads to be resisted are those resulting from wind and earthquake actions, but other lateral loads such as lateral earth pressure or hydrostatic pressure can also be resisted by diaphragm action. The diaphragm of a structure often does double duty as the floor system or roof system in a building, or the deck of a bridge, which simultaneously supports gravity loads. Diaphragms are usually constructed of plywood or oriented strand board in timber construction; metal deck or composite metal deck in steel construction; or a concrete slab in concrete construction. The two primary types of diaphragm are flexible and rigid. Flexible diaphragms resist lateral forces depending on the tributary area, irrespective of the flexibility of the members that they are transferring force to. On the other hand, rigid diaphragms transfer load to frames or shear walls depending on their flexibility and their location in the structure. The flexibility of a diaphragm affects the distribution of lateral forces to the vertical components of the lateral force resisting elements in a structure. An Investigation of the Influence of Diaphragm Flexibility on Building Design through a Comparison of Forced Vibration Testing and Computational Analysis Parts of a diaphragm include: *the membrane, used as a shear panel to carry in-plane shear *the drag strut member, used to transfer the load to the shear walls or frames *the chord, used to resist the tension and compression forces that develop in the diaphragm, since the membrane is usually incapable of handling these loads alone.

The festival program runs for a week each fall, and there are also several off-season events regularly occurring throughout the year. Programming is available in both English and French. While most of the events occur in Winnipeg, there are also some at Brandon University and throughout the province. History The Winnipeg International Writers Festival was founded by Andris Taskans, Mark Steven Morton, and Robyn Maharaj in 1996, with the first festival running from October 14 to 19 of the following year.http://themanitoban.com/1997-1998/1008/arts.html The festival hosted approximately 50 writers from across Canada and around the world. The creation of the festival was explained as follows: > \\"It grew out of the determination to see that the writing, reading and > publishing community was being served the way other [Winnipeg] cultural > communities were being served. \\"You have music aficionados being offered > events such as the Jazz Festival and the New Music Festival, theatre-goers > have the Fringe Festival - we're a festival town. People like to have large- > scale events which offer them a lot of choice and that's what we wanted to > do for the writing community.\\" - Paula Kelly, coordinator for the 1997 > Winnipeg Writers Festival, quoted in The Manitoban. The festival involved collaboration from a number of organizations, including Prairie Fire, the Manitoba Writers' Guild, the West End Cultural Centre (which had previously hosted a Word on the Street series), the Interfaith Marriage and Family Institute, and the University of Winnipeg. In addition, Balmoral Hall School hosted a number of school events related to the festival. Since that time the THIN AIR festival has become a regular fixture in the province. Current Staff Currently the Winnipeg International Writers Festival is staffed by Director Charlene Diehl, General Manager Perry Grosshans, Administrative Coordinator Aaron Simm, and Coordonnatrice Karen San Filippo. 2009 THIN AIR Programming The 2009 THIN AIR festival ran from September 20 to 27.

Geographical distribution The Iraqi capital city Baghdad prides itself of making the best masguf, with the Abu Nawas district on the shores of the Tigris river, \\"dedicated\\" to this dish, having more than two dozen fish restaurants. Nonetheless, one can find masg√ªf all over Iraq, especially near the Tigris- Euphrates Basin. Outside of Iraq, masguf is more or less popular in the Al Jazira as in the rural parts of Syria, especially in the regions bordering Iraq, such as in the Raqqa Governorate, which is crossed by the Euphrates. It is also seen, at a lesser scale, in the Jazira areas located in Turkey, such as Nusaybin and Cizre, on the Iraqi border. Masguf is now also found in Damascus due to a high number of Iraqi exiles living there since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\\"ÿ£ÿ≥ÿπÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑÿπŸÇÿßÿ±ÿßÿ™ ŸÅŸä ÿ¨ÿ±ŸÖÿßŸÜÿß ÿ™ÿ™ÿ≠ÿØŸâ ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÜÿ≠ÿØÿßÿ± ..

The fish is brought daily from the Syrian Euphrates to these restaurants, and is kept alive in a fishpond or a big aquarium until it is ordered. Preparation and serving Carp fish The fish is caught alive and weighed. It is clubbed to kill it, partially scaled and gutted. The fish is then split lengthwise down the back, washed and spread out into a single flat piece. This opens the fish into the shape of a large, symmetrical circle, while leaving the belly intact. From there, the cook bastes the inside of the fish with a marinade of olive oil, rock salt, tamarind, and ground turmeric. Crushed tomatoes and coriander are sometimes added to the marinade. The fish is then either impaled on two sharp iron spikes, or placed in a big iron, clamshell grill with a handle and a locking snare, designed specifically for this dish.Masgouf :Prepare fish like they did along the Tigris The fish, either clamped in the grill or mounted on the spikes, is then placed next to the fire on the \\"fire altar\\", a feature shared by all masg√ªf restaurants. This \\"altar\\" typically consists of a big open-air area centered by a raised, podium-like sandbox that is either round, octagonal or sometimes rectangular, in the middle of which there is a large fire of apricot tree logs. Cooking typically takes between one and three hours, until most of the fish's fat is burned off, during which time the guests will pick at their mezes. When the fish is well cooked, it is laid on the coals, skin side down. This crisps the skin and helps release the flesh from it for serving ease. The whole fish is typically laid on a large tray garnished with lime (or lemon), slices of onion and Iraqi pickles. Sometimes, in Baghdad, a little mango chutney is also spread on the inside. The tray is then covered by a large crispy flatbread straight of a clay oven to keep its contents hot until served to the client.Taus-Bolstad, Stacy (2003) Iraq in Pictures, Twenty-First Century Books, p.55, Variations The Turkmens of Northern Iraq are known to prepare a similar recipe, often using a clay oven. See also *Iraqi cuisine *Middle Eastern cuisine Notes Masguf arguably being the most famous dish of Iraq, it is also the one that is always the foremost served to foreign delegations visiting the country by the Iraqi statesmen. Two notable admirers of this dish are said to be the former President of France, Jacques Chirac and Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the former chairman of the Russian Duma. Chirac apparently fell for masg√ªf during a visit to Iraq in a formal dinner given to his honor by Saddam Hussein.

It is a combined primary and secondary school, which offers KCPE, KCSE, IGCSE and IBDP certification. As a boys' school, female students are only allowed to enroll for the IB Diploma Programme. The school's motto is \\"Bonitas, Disciplina, Scientia\\", which is Latin for \\"Goodness, Discipline, Knowledge\\". History An early student of the school with his parents in 1949. St. Mary's School was founded in the Parklands area of Nairobi in 1939 from Blackrock College in Dublin, Ireland. In September 1945, the school was moved to a temporary structure on an site on the land belonging to the St. Austin's Mission in the Muthangari area of Westlands. The present-day school buildings were completed in 1954, including the twin towers that stand at the school's quadrangle and the older St. Austin's Catholic Church, which sits beside the school's parking area. In between the towers is the staff room where teachers convene for meetings and take their breaks, which used to be the school's library. Present day From the outset, Saints has always had a combined primary and secondary school. Although only boys are admitted to the primary and secondary schools, girls (along with boys) are admitted to the International Baccalaureate diploma course which is a post-O-level programme offered by the school since 1982.International Baccalaureate Entrants are chosen on the basis of their KCSE and IGCSE results. The school year runs from January to November. The school is near its neighbouring sister school, Loreto Convent Msongari, separated only by a fence and a gate, and is situated about 1,000 metres away from rival Strathmore School. Students are encouraged to participate in extra curricular activities, which include sports, clubs, music and drama. All the school's sports teams are nicknamed \\"Saints\\", also the school's nickname. Theatre Since 1971, the school has been staging a musical every year, open to the general public. The musical week runs on specific dates from Tuesday to Saturday. The school has staged its own productions of famous plays such as The Mikado, The Yeomen of the Guard, The King and I, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat,The Sound of Music, Sarafina!, Cinderella, Oklahoma!, The Music Man, Ipi N'tombi, Aida, Zambezi Express, Amazing Grace (the musical).Arts  St. Mary's School Nairobi Notable guests who have attended the school's shows in the past include former Prime Minister of Kenya Raila Odinga.@RailaOdinga on Twitter: \\"Arriving at St. Mary's School to watch the musical play \\"Aida\\" performed by the students.\\" (6 March 2014).

The club is most noted for competing in the early Italian Football Championship competitions, before becoming one of three Rome based clubs merging to form AS Roma in 1927. History The club was founded in 1907 as Societ√† Sportiva Alba and was owned for its known existence by Roman named Umberto Farneti. Farneti owned some land in the Flaminio area of Rome, this is where the club would play and consider their home. During the earliest days of the Italian Football Championship, only Northern Italian football clubs gained entry into the league so Alba had to wait until 1912‚Äì13 to make their championship debut. After qualifying for the Lazio section of the championship, Alba were forced to forfeit their fixtures. At the end of 1925‚Äì26 season, the club was forced by the Fascist Regime to absorb another Roman club, Audace Roma, but retained its colors. After only one season, Alba- Audace was merged with Roman F.C. and Fortitudo-Pro Roma S.G.S. to form A.S. Roma. The club briefly reformed in 1945 and, after merging with Trastevere Roma, took part to the 1946‚Äì47 Serie B season as Alba Trastevere before disbanding.

A performance fee may be calculated many ways. With respect to a separate account, it is often based on the change in net realized and unrealized gains, although in some cases, it can be based on other measures, such as net income generated.Lemke and Lins, Regulation of Investment Advisers, ¬ß2:10 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.) While not very common, some fund managers have attempted to link the performance fee to both upward and downward movement in a fund's gains, such as the shock absorber fee, where the fund manager gets penalised (before the investor) for adverse movement in the fund value. With respect to hedge funds and other investment funds, it is generally calculated by reference to the increase in the clientfund's net asset value (or \\"NAV\\"), which represents the value of the fund's investments. Performance fees are widely used by the investment managers of hedge funds, which typically charge a performance fee of 20% of the increase in the NAV of the fund in addition to the base management fee.Lemke, Lins, Hoenig and Rube, Hedge Funds and Other Private Funds: Regulation and Compliance, ¬ß¬ß3:30 - 3:33 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.). In the United States, performance fees charged by registered investment advisers are subject to certain requirements under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.Lemke and Lins, Regulation of Investment Advisers, ¬ß¬ß2:15 - 2:18 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). In addition, performance fees may be charged to registered investment companies only under certain conditions.Lemke, Lins and Smith, Regulation of Investment Companies, ¬ß7.11[3] (Matthew Bender, 2013 ed.). Finally, performance fees charged to pension plans governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) must also meet certain requirements.Lemke and Lins, ERISA for Money Managers, ¬ß¬ß2:92 - 2:96 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). Worked example An example might be as follows: An investor subscribes for shares worth $1,000,000 in a hedge fund. Over the next year the NAV of the fund increases by 10%, making the investor's shares worth $1,100,000. Of the $100,000 increase, 20% (i.e. $20,000) will be paid to the investment manager, thereby reducing the NAV of the fund by that amount and leaving the investor with shares worth $1,080,000, giving a return of 8% before deduction of any other fees. High water marks The highest NAV of a fund to date is known as the \\"high water mark\\". If the NAV of a fund declines during a year, no performance fee will be payable to the investment manager. If the NAV subsequently increases over the following year back to the high- water mark (but no higher), it would be objectionable for the investor to be charged a performance fee on that increase because the investor has not yet made any return on its investment. Therefore, to address this concern, hedge funds will typically only charge a performance fee on increases in NAV over the high-water mark. This also applies to mutual funds though variably. Hurdles A hurdle, in the context of a performance fee, is a level of return that the fund must beat before it can charge a performance fee. It may be a set percentage or it may be referenced to an index. The index would typically be either LIBOR (or an equivalent) or an index reflecting the underlying market in which the fund is investing. The purpose of the latter is to reward the fund for generating returns that are better than the market (alpha) rather than for returns generated simply by movement in the market as a whole. If, in the worked example, there had been a hurdle of 4%, the performance fee would only have been charged on the additional 6% increase rather than the full 10% increase in NAV. As hurdles reduce the size of performance fees and reward successful active management, they are popular with investors. However, as demand for hedge funds has been high in recent years, fewer hedge funds have needed to resort to their use to attract investors. Other fees As well as a performance fee, a hedge fund will charge a management fee, typically calculated as 1.50% to 2% of the NAV of the fund, regardless of whether the fund has generated any returns for the investor. Hedge funds may also pay fees to administrators, prime brokers, lawyers, accountants and other service providers. Terminology While this article uses the term \\"NAV\\" for simplicity, in reality a performance fee would be charged by reference to the NAV per share (being the net asset value divided by the number of shares in issue). The NAV will fluctuate as investors subscribe for and redeem shares, whereas the NAV per share will only fluctuate as the underlying investments increase or decrease in value, making the latter the appropriate measure for calculating a performance fee. Where a hedge fund is structured as a limited partnership or unit trust, the terms \\"interest\\" and \\"unit\\" should be substituted for \\"share\\".

He made his first-team debut in February of that year in a 3‚Äì1 top-flight defeat by Manchester United at Leeds Road seen by 31,408. He made a total of 94 appearances for Huddersfield Town, scoring ten goals. The first of these was in a First Division game against Manchester City in September 1955.

Huddersfield became the first, and still the only, team to score six goals in a professional football match and still be on the losing side. Bristol City Connor joined Bristol City in October 1960 in an exchange deal which brought Scottish striker John McCann to Huddersfield. He went on to play 408 times and score 10 goals for the club before retiring from professional football in 1971, making him their 13th top appearance maker. Formby Connor signed for Formby, his local non-league side, in September 1973, and ten weeks later was in the biggest game in the club's history, an FA Cup first round tie against Oldham Athletic. He was a regular in the first team until he retired from playing at the end of the 1975‚Äì76 season, aged 41. Everton Moving into coaching, Connor became reserve team manager at Everton.

History and profile Founded in 1978 by Nick WestNick West currently suffers from a grave ailment. See and E.A. Srere, Sluggo! began as a tabloid-sized photocopied publication, and evolved into a quintessential DIY publication. The first issue appeared in December 1978. With the donation of a Multilith 1250 offset press and an array of colored inks, Sluggo! acquired its distinctive multi-colored, multi-faceted appearance. Sluggo! look was also defined by its unique covers ‚Äì hand-crafted on some issues, individually silk-screened on black velvet on the finale. The early issues centered primarily on music with reviews of shows of both local and touring bands, and record reviews of both national and international acts such as Pere Ubu, PIL, Throbbing Gristle. In addition to music, Sluggo! columnists also held forth on subjects ranging from religion to science, international politics to local gossip. In 1979, Sluggo! departed from the typical music fanzine with the introduction of its thematic issues. Topics were Violence, Unco, and culminated with its \\"Industrial Collapse\\" issue. The magazine also created the Instant Review, publishing critiques of local performances overnight with free distribution on the streets the very next day. The Sluggo! press was used not only for printing the fanzine but was also made available to local bands for printing band posters and record covers, and to other raconteurs for printing various handbills and broadsides. Sluggo! House became one of the centers of the exploding Austin scene and drew considerable local and national attention as a hotbed of musical and artistic action. Sluggo! provided inspiration to other writers and entrepreneurs to found and publish their own fanzines including Xiphoid Process and Contempo Culture from Austin, and a myriad of others throughout Texas. Sluggo!'s topical format also served as a model to the staff at Search & Destroy Magazine from San Francisco to expand their horizons and begin the RE/Search magazine with issues devoted to a single topic. Sluggo! was a primary ambassador of the 1970s Austin punk/new wave scene throughout Texas, the nation and overseas. Its evolution from a modest home grown fanzine to a distinctively quirky journal with ambitions of a wider cultural window mirrors the peculiar growth of the Austin punk music and artistic scene, and its future development into the behemoth it is today. It ceased publication in 1979.

On February 28, 2015, he was crowned the 2015 Big Wave World Champion in the World Surf League's (WSL) first sanctioned Big Wave World Tour (BWWT). Life and career Makuakai (Makua) Rothman, is Jewish, born to an American Jewish father and a Hawaiian mother, on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii. He attended Kahuku High School in Kahuku, Hawaii, playing soccer, football, baseball, karate, and water polo. An accomplished professional big wave surfer and aspiring musician, Rothman was crowned the 2015 Big Wave World Champion. Rothman achieved a milestone in surfing at age 18 when he won the 2003 Billabong XXL Award for riding a 66-foot wave at Jaws on November 26, 2002 (the largest wave known to be surfed anywhere in the world that winter). Rothman credits his surfing ability in large part to his father, Eddie Rothman. As a child, Rothman suffered from asthma, making surfing a personally difficult and dangerous pursuit. His father decided to involve him in various sports such as soccer, baseball, football, and water polo as strenuous workouts seemed to help relieve his asthma. Rothman later attributed his physical stamina and dedication to these pursuits. Before he was 10 years old, Rothman was surfing some of Hawaii's most notable and biggest waves, including Pipeline and Sunset Beach. When he was eight, he surfed 12-foot Waimea waves, an unusual feat for a young boy, one that helped prepare him for his later big-wave accomplishments. By the time he was 13, Rothman was known as a promising young surfer in the surfing community. Surrounded by accomplished older surfers such as Sunny Garcia, Myles Padaca, Johnny Boy Gomes, and Dane Kealoha, Rothman learned how to dive, surf, farm, and hunt. He credits these men as role models who instilled values of leadership and respect.  Music career  USO tour at Ramstein Air Base in 2019 Rothman had not considered music as a career until 2012, when his friend Rob Garcia told him that people should hear his music. On the verge of leaving for a trip to Indonesia, Rothman decided to cancel the trip to work on his music. A few months later, he released his first EP, Makanale Road. Since then, he‚Äôs released a full-length album in 2013, Sound Wave, and toured all over the US, headlining small shows and opening for artists such as Matisyahu, Sublime w/Rome, Common Kings, The Wailers, Steel Pulse, Slightly Stoopid, Rebelution, and Donavon Frankenreiter. Sound Wave debuted as the #1 Billboard World Album on iTunes and peaked as the #1 Billboard Reggae Album on December 28, 2013. In 2017, he guest performed on Goldfinger's album The Knife, playing ukeke on \\"Liftoff\\". Siblings Makua has two younger brothers, and a younger sister. Koa Rothman, the middle brother of the Rothman siblings and ten years younger than Makua, is also an accomplished big wave pro surfer who first surfed big waves (Hawaiian system) at age 17. In 2014, at the age of 21, he won both the Best Tube Award from his ride at Teahupoo and the Billabong XXL Wipeout of the Year Award with his feat also at Teahupoo and on the same wave.

He played hurling at various times with his local clubs Rosslare and Newmarket-on Fergus with the Wexford and Clare senior inter- county teams in the 1960s. Griffin later served as manager of the Wexford senior inter-county team from in 1995 and 1996. Later he was instrumental on the Hurling Development Committee that established the Christy Ring Cup and Nicky Rackard Cup for weaker hurling counties. In 2009 he was named in the Sunday Tribunes list of the 125 Most Influential People In GAA History. Biography Griffin was born in Rosslare, County Wexford in 1945 or 1947. His parents ran a guesthouse in the town before buying a small hotel nearby in the late 1950s. Griffin was educated locally and later worked in his parents‚Äô hotel. In the 1960s he became the first member of his family to study hotel management at the Shannon College of Hotel Management and he later spent a decade working in various hotels in Wales, Switzerland and Ireland. In the 1970s Griffin left the hotel industry and joined Bord F√°ilte to gain experience in the wider tourism industry. He later returned to buy his parents hotel in Rosslare at the end of the decade and began building up his business empire. By the start of the 2000s the Griffin Group, run by Liam and two of his sons, controlled three hotels across the south-east coast of Ireland. After finishing his playing and managerial careers in hurling Griffin later served as a pundit with RT√â's The Sunday Game. In 2008 he became part of the analysis team on TV3's championship coverage and has been a regular hurling analyst on The Breakfast Show and The Right Hook on Newstalk radio for a number of years. Playing career=Club Griffin played his early club hurling with his local club in Rosslare and had some juvenile success. After moving to Clare in the 1960s he joined the Newmarket-on Fergus club. Here he played a key role in helping the club win three senior county titles in 1967, 1968 and 1969. Inter-county Griffin first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with the Wexford minor team. He later played with the Clare under-21 team, however, he enjoyed little success with 'the Banner county.' Griffin didn't continue playing after the under-21 grade. Managerial career=Wexford In spite of cutting his inter-county hurling career short Griffin became interested in coaching. Since the early 1970s he coached juvenile teams in the Wexford area and in the early 1990s he completed a diploma in sport psychology. In 1994 Griffin was appointed manager of the Wexford senior inter-county team, however, he wasn't the county board's first choice for the post. He had earlier stood for election as manager of the Wexford minor team and was defeated twice. Fate played a hand in Griffin taking the senior managerial position as some of the earlier favourites withdrew from the race and he got the job. Wexford hurling was in the doldrums at the time as the team hadn‚Äôt won a senior All-Ireland title since 1968 or a senior Leinster title since 1977. =1995: First season= Griffin's first season in charge in 1995 saw little in the way of improvement. In spite of introducing a strict diet and training regime his side were beaten by the minnows of Meath in the National Hurling League while the team's championship preparations did not go to plan either. Liam Dunne, the team captain, played a club match for Oulart-the Ballagh before the Leinster semi-final and was duly stripped of the captaincy. This caused tensions between some of the players and Griffin. The first outing in the championship saw Wexford fall by seven points to Offaly and Griffin was put under severe pressure. =1996: Leinster and All-Ireland successes= In 1996 Griffin made wholesale changes throughout the team and enforced his new training regime. Clare‚Äôs All-Ireland victory in 1995 spurred on the so-called ‚Äòweaker counties‚Äô and Griffin tried to get his players to believe in themselves. Griffin‚Äôs motivational techniques paid off as Wexford defeated Offaly to capture their first Leinster title in nearly twenty years. Wexford later qualified to play in the All-Ireland final where Limerick, the defeated finalists of 1994, provided the opposition. The Munstermen were slight favourites going into the match, however, Griffin‚Äôs side led by a point at half-time in spite of being reduced to fourteen players. The team hung on in the second half to clinch a 1-13 to 0-14 victory, their first All-Ireland in 28 years. In spite of guiding his native-county to an emotional championship title Griffin decided to retire as manager at the start of 1997 due to personal issues. Promotion of hurling In early 2000, Griffin said the GAA should be ashamed of itself over its failure in the promotion of hurling.

She was born as Carolyn Elizabeth Creighton in Cambridge, Maryland. She studied piano as a child, winning a scholarship to study piano at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore in 1932 at the age of 16. Her singing voice soon proved to be a greater gift, however, and she changed to vocal studies two years later. She was said to have made her stage debut in Baltimore while still a student in The Old Maid and the Thief by Gian Carlo Menotti, but this is unlikely as the work premiered in 1939, around the time Long would have been completing her studies at Peabody. She then enjoyed an active career in the United States for a number of years, with major opera, concert and radio appearances. She sang with the Oscar Strauss Festival and the Community Concerts Association across the USA. She made at least one recording for a major label, Jeanne d'Arc au B√ªcher, by Arthur Honegger. This recording, issued in 1953, was made with the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy. and featured Vera Zorina in the speaking role of Joan of Arc. Private recordings from her personal collection exist, but are generally of extremely poor technical quality. They include at least one live recital and at least one radio broadcast from the International Harvester Hour, in which she sings light classical and popular songs with the International Harvester Orchestra and tenor James Melton. From her operatic appearances one may infer that her voice was a lyrico-spinto soprano. The private recordings bear this out, and also show considerable warmth, personality and humor. She sang with most of the leading symphony orchestras in the United States. Although she did not appear at the Metropolitan Opera at its home in New York City, she did appear with the Metropolitan Opera National Touring Company in Cincinnati. She also appeared at Carnegie Hall, the Hollywood Bowl, and Chicago's Grant Park. Her appearances included operetta, including Bloomer Girl, and television. Her opera appearances included Tosca (as Tosca), Faust (as Marguerite), The Barber of Seville, Salome, Aida, Rigoletto, Carmen, La traviata, La boh√®me and Il trovatore. She appeared with such singers as tenor Mario Lanza, bass Ezio Pinza, tenor Nino Martini, and Japanese soprano Hizi Koyke. Long sang at the White House for President Harry Truman and his Vice President, Alben Barkley. In 1954 she was chosen by Rose and Ira Gershwin to be the \\"Gershwin Girl\\" for their touring show which also featured the young Lorin Maazel. She studied singing in Italy as well, from 1954 to 1956. While in Europe, she appeared in the first English language opera production to occur in Spain since Francisco Franco's accession to power in the Spanish Civil War. Later years Health and personal problems may have contributed to a relatively early end to her career. Her later years were spent as a private voice teacher in Bethesda, Maryland, where she lived with her lifelong friend and companion, Carolyn \\"Bobby\\" Drury. She also taught voice at American University and the Prince George's Community College, in Maryland. She spent her final years in a nursing home in her home town of Cambridge, Maryland, where she died. She is buried at Dorchester Memorial Park in Cambridge, Md alongside her friend Carolyn \\"Bobby\\" Drury. She was married, at Christ Episcopal Church in Cambridge, Maryland on June 27, 1937 (her parents' wedding anniversary) to Hugh-Blair Grigsby Long of Charlottesville, Virginia.Index to the Dorchester County, Maryland's Daily Banner The marriage ended in divorce.

The motorway dam spans the Deanhead Valley in the Pennines between Huddersfield and Rochdale and the main contractor for the project was Sir Alfred McAlpine & Sons.Gray, p. 79 Deanhead village was submerged and many buildings demolished to make way for the reservoir but the church remains and its vicarage is used by the sailing club. Both the church and adjacent school were at risk of slipping down the hillside into the dam and were not used after 1971 when the motorway opened. The church was renovated in 2002 and the old schoolhouse has been converted into a private dwelling. Surveying began in November 1961 and the route of the carriageway was determined in mid 1963. Excavation in the Deanhead Valley commenced the following year and for the dam in 1966. This required the removal of of peat bog to reach the solid rock base nearly below ground level. Material excavated elsewhere on the line of the motorway, clay from cuttings between Lofthouse and Gildersome, and 3.4 million cubic metres from the Deanhead excavations was used to build the dam's embankment which is in length and above the original valley floor. The 3.6 million cubic metre embankment is wide at its base and at road level. Scammonden Water is at its deepest point and water is drawn-off through a tunnel driven southwards to supply Huddersfield. The overflow bellmouth, next to the valve shaft superstructure, discharges water to the valley below via a tunnel in the valley on the reservoir's eastern side. The reservoir started to fill in July 1969 and the area was landscaped and parking and other facilities were provided. The motorway, which was dependent on the completion of the dam, was opened to traffic on 20 December 1970 and officially opened by HM Queen Elizabeth II who unveiled a plaque near the valve tower of Scammonden Water on 14 October 1971.  Leisure activities  The reservoir is home to Scammonden Water Sailing Club or SWSC. The sailing club has the exclusive rights to the water, which means that the activities on the water are either dingy cruising or racing. Other activities occasionally take place usually under the auspices of the scouts. Huddersfield Scout Sailing is a Royal Yachting Association Training Centre run by volunteers for scouts and guides. There is also a scouting activity centre located at the water's edge which also holds the boat workshop for scout sailing. Scammonden Steps Close to the reservoir, at the other side of the motorway and dam wall, Scammonden steps comprises five flights of steps up the hillside from the valley below. Totaling 458 steps, the cumulative step count when ascending each of the five flights is 95, 200, 287, 363 then 458.  References  Sources  *  External links  * M62.

She lived in Berlin from 1945 until her death. Katharina Szelinski-Singer was an accomplished sculptor who studied at the Berlin University of the Arts, where she was a master student of Richard Scheibe. Shortly after finishing her studies in the mid- fifties she was commissioned to do a sculpture for park \\"Hasenheide\\" in Berlin. The sculpture was intended to honour the German Tr√ºmmerfrauen (German for: rubble women), those women who after the end of the Second World War played a major role in rebuilding the city by clearing up the rubble of the damaged buildings. This limestone-sculpture is until now her most well-known work in a public place. After several similar but smaller commissions she lived from 1956 till 1986 mainly from doing restoring work at the Charlottenburg Palace. Katharina Szelinski-Singer was considered an outsider in the art scene:Beschreibung/Darstellung von Helmut B√∂rsch-Supan, in: Berger, Ursel; B√∂rsch-Supan, Helmut: Katharina ‚Ä¶ , ‚Ä¶ (Ausstellungskatalog) Although following up a different career path she continued to sculpture, but till 1987 her work could only rarely be seen in exhibitions. This changed in 1987‚Äì88, when the Georg-Kolbe-Museum showed her work in a large exhibition dedicated only to her. All in all 45 of her sculptures have been shown there.Katharina Szelinski-Singer: Bildhauerarbeiten ... Sculpture ‚ÄûPorphyr‚Äú, 1988 Her work consists roughly of one hundred sculptures which are without exemption figurative. She is practically always showing bodies or heads of women; very often they are an image of herself or influenced by elements from her own life. With the sculpture series K√∂pfe (German for: Heads) she was able to free herself to some extent from the influence of her teacher Richard Scheibe and develop new ways to express herself. This resulted also in a more extensive usage of bronze and gypsum, after a long period of working with natural stone. Art experts judge her work to be in line with the so-called \\"Berliner Bildhauerschule\\" (Berlin sculptor school). She died on 20 December 2010, at age 92, in Berlin and was buried at the Friedhof Heerstra√üe. NotesReferences (exhibition catalogues) * Katharina Szelinski-Singer: Bildhauerarbeiten.

In East Texas, the summer after high school, Jack falls in love with Ginny, the daughter of the town's banker (Jack's mom's high school sweetheart). Ginny's been at boarding school; she's headed for Vassar. Over her father's strenuous objections, she spends time with Jack. At summer's end, Jack and Ginny elope to Louisiana (where 17-year-olds can marry without their parents' permission), and he gets a job in the oil fields. Her dad hires a menacing private eye to find them, Ginny's pregnant, her town doctor gives her horrible news, and Jack's mom has her own agenda. It seems that Jack and Ginny have grown up under a liar's moon. What will these sweethearts do? CastProduction notes The film was shot in and around Houston, Texas. It was Broderick Crawford's last film after 45 years and one of Matt Dillon's earliest films. Liar's Moon was choreographed by Patsy Swayze.

Plot  Donald Kohler is obsessed with fire. A flashback shows the origin of his obsession: When he was young, he used to suffer severe abuse from his mother, who would hold his bare arms over a gas stove to \\"burn the evil out of him\\". After his mother dies, he sets out to avenge himself on any woman who bears a resemblance to her. He befriends a florist named Kathy. She walks him back to his mother's house, where he knocks her unconscious and chains her up. Ignoring Kathy's pleas for mercy, he pours gasoline on her and burns her with his flamethrower. Over the next few days, Donny murders two other women by immolating them. Donny also burns his mother's corpse and dresses it up in her bedroom, along with the other three dead women. He begins to feel remorse for his actions. Donny goes to a church, where he tells Father Gerritty about the abuse his mother inflicted upon him and about his urges to kill. Father Gerritty persuades Donny to try to move on with his life and leave the past to rest. In an attempt to stop killing, Donny accepts his friend Bobby‚Äôs invitation to go on a double date. Donny shows up but is shy and awkward. When the woman tries to take Donny to the dance floor, she inadvertently holds his arms over the table's lighted candle, which reminds him of his childhood abuse. Donny angrily picks up the candle holder and smashes it onto her head, setting her hair on fire. After fleeing from the disco, Donny runs into two drunken girls on the street and takes them to his house. Bobby tries to find Donny and meets Father Gerritty on his way to Donny's house. When no one answers the front door, they break it down and rescue the two women. Donny sets Father Gerritty ablaze with his flamethrower, but Bobby manages to put out the flames and rescue him. Donny takes refuge inside his mother's bedroom. The voices express their disappointment in him, and the burned corpses come to life and attack him. He frantically fights them but dies; they drag him to the floor as the house burns down around him. The final scene portrays a young boy named Michael watching the news report about Donny's death. His mother scolds and beats him for not turning off the TV as she asks him to. When she leaves the room, Michael hears the same voices as Donny did, and they tell him that they come to 'help' him.

The soundtrack was released by Waxwork Records in 2019 as a double LP, making it the first ever soundtrack release for the film.  Controversy  Despite some respectable critical notices, Don't Go in the House attracted controversy almost immediately because of its graphic depiction of the death of Kohler's first victim, and the central theme of childhood abuse. The film was cut by almost three minutes when it was released in Britain in the winter of 1980, but an uncut version was released on video by the Arcade label in 1982 ‚Äì knowingly or not, they advertised the release as \\"a true 'nasty' from Arcade\\", and it quickly wound up on the DPP's list of banned titles, or video nasties.Wilson, Dave.\\"Retrospective: Don‚Äôt Go in the House (1980) ‚Äì Ignore the Warning and Go In\\". Dread Central, 2016-10-01. Retrieved 2018-07-12. The pre-cut British cinema version was released on video by the Apex label in April 1987, though the film was finally passed uncut in 2011. Release=Home media Don't Go into the House was released for the first time on DVD by DVD Ltd on December 2, 1998. It was later released by Shriek Show on November 29, 2005. Shriek Show would later re-release the film on February 5, 2008, as a part of its three-disk \\"Grindhouse Psychos!\\" film pack. Critical response On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Don‚Äôt Go in the House holds a 40% approval rating based on 5 critic reviews, with an average rating of 3.75/10. DVD Talk gave the film a three and a half out of five, writing that, Don't Go in the House \\"is one of those rare films that works really well despite the fact that rips off better known movies\\" and \\"it's a bitter, ugly, and nasty little horror movie that doesn't pull any punches and is just as seedy today as it was when it was made. It's effective in that it gets under your skin despite its low budget origins and obvious flaws\\". Hysteria Lives! gave the film a similar rating, writing, \\"Grim is the only word for Joseph Ellison's psychological terror movie\\" and \\"It's easy to forget just how nihilistic much of American genre cinema was as the 70s turned into the 80s (especially with the avalanche of cheese that was just round the corner), but Don't Go in the House is a chilly reminder of times when practically anything went\\". In a retrospective, Dave J. Wilson from Dread Central felt the film was underappreciated, and called it \\"a dark, chilling, grim and gruesome depiction of the tragic repercussions of child abuse\\". TV Guide rated the film no stars out of five, calling it a \\"worthless, repugnant film\\" and panned the film's finale as \\"baffling\\". Retro Slashers found Don't Go in the House a \\"very dull\\" piece that was brought down by bad acting, and a lack of suspense and originality. The Terror Trap awarded the film a mixed two out of four stars, stating that the film had \\"little value as a 'demented' character study\\", while also commending Grimaldi's performance and overall creepiness.

Joel McCrea played Marshal Mike Dunbar, in charge of keeping the peace the booming cowtown of Wichita, Kansas. His deputies were Ben Matheson, played by McCrea's real life son, Jody, and Rico Rodriquez, portrayed by Carlos Romero. Making occasional appearances were the town doctor, Nat Wyndham (played by George Neise), the blacksmith, Aeneas MacLinahan (played by Robert Anderson), and the bartender in the local saloon, Joe Kingston, played in six episodes by Robert Foulk. The model for shows such as these had already been laid out by other western programs such as Gunsmoke, Lawman, and The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp, so Wichita Town may not have been unique in its plotting and structure. The two most unusual features about the series were the presence of Joel McCrea, a favorite of Western movie audiences for his performance in such films as Union Pacific, Buffalo Bill, and Ramrod, and the fact that his real life son was in Wichita Town, but did not play his son. Wichita Town was produced by Mirisch Company and Joel McCrea's Production company for Four Star Television and aired for a single season.

A five-string violin is a variant violin with an extra string tuned to a pitch below the violin's usual range. In addition to the G, D, A, and E strings of a standard violin, a five-string violin typically includes a lower C string. The five-string violin was created as a solution for improvisers that allowed musicians to combine the pitch ranges of the violin and viola. Bobby Hicks, an noted bluegrass fiddler, popularized the five-string violin in 1963 as he first showcased his modification during his performance in Las Vegas. The 5 string violin has a flaw though, the C string is too low for the body of the violin, so some musicians prefer a 5 string viola still with the same tuning. Structure The components that make up a five-string violin are very similar to those found on a traditional violin. The strings are typically tuned to the following pitches, given in scientific pitch notation: C3, G3, D4, A4 and E5. The shape of the body and neck of a five-string violin closely resemble that of a traditional violin. The body may be slightly wider and deeper to improve the resonance of the C string, though still smaller than a viola. It features a larger pegbox to accommodate the fifth string. Uses Five-string violins excel in musical styles that allow for improvisation because of their wide range and versatility. They are most commonly used in country fiddling, swing, and jazz music. Users of this instrument favor its ability to play pieces written for either violin or viola as well as new pieces that utilize the combined ranges of those instruments.

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, comic books and animated series. He is the G.I. Joe Team's helicopter pilot and debuted in 1983. Profile His real name is William S. Hardy, and his rank is that of army chief warrant officer CW-4. Wild Bill was born in Brady, Texas. His primary military specialty is helicopter pilot and his secondary military specialties are fixed wing pilot and aircraft armorer. Wild Bill served as a combat infantryman and participated in LRRP operations during the Vietnam War. He reenlisted for Flight Warrant Officer School and has remained in service since, but his specialized training records are classified. Wild Bill joined the G.I. Joe Team as the pilot of the \\"Dragonfly\\" helicopter. He is a qualified expert in the M1911A auto pistol and the XM-16 attack rifle, but prefers single action .45 long colt revolvers. Wild Bill is the original helicopter pilot for the G.I. Joe team, and is also an expert tracker and can function on the ground as well as any trained infantry scout. He is able to adapt the hunting skills he learned as a boy whenever he's tracking the enemy, saying that sneaking up on a Cobra is easier than sneaking up on most 'critters'. Wild Bill has a hobby as a country-western singer. While personally honest, he enjoys telling tall tales for the amusement of his friends. Toy history The character first appeared as part of the 1983 line of the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero toy line. His action figure was bundled with the Dragonfly helicopter toy. A second edition action figure was released in 1992, and his function is re-designated as an Air Cavalry Scout. The figure was repainted and released as part of the Battle Corps line in 1993. In 2002, a new figure was made utilizing the newer technology in articulation and detail. It was released as part of the G.I. Joe vs. Cobra series. Comics=Marvel Comics In the Marvel Comics G.I. Joe series, Wild Bill first appeared in issue #11 (May 1983). He had a prominent role in the storylines despite serving mainly as a supporting character, and made the most appearances (eleven) in the Special Missions spinoff series. He often flies the Joes to their missions, either in the Dragonfly, the Tomahawk helicopter or the C-130 plane. Wild Bill accompanies Snake Eyes to give Kwinn a burial at sea.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #22 (1984) Wild Bill flies support for a multi-Joe mission investigating Cobra activity in the Florida Everglades. His helicopter is shot down by Destro's wrist rockets.

Joe: A Real American Hero #25-30 (1984) In the fourth issue of Special Missions, he and his team crash-land in a Southeast Asian jungle and had to battle the Oktober Guard and river pirates. His team consists of Leatherneck, Roadblock and Lifeline. Wild Bill is shot by the Guard but survives. Tensions arise because Leatherneck blames Lifeline, who is a pacifist. The Joes and the Guard are captured by river pirates. There, Wild Bill recovers enough to see Lifeline's forced battle with a Guard member and comment upon it. The Guard and the Joes are allowed to leave, sans the item they came for, because Lifeline's unwillingness to hurt the Guard member more than he had to impresses the pirates.G.I. Joe Secret Missions #4 In one of Wild Bill's many helicopter missions, he almost kills the Cobra agents Tomax and Xamot. They escape with a turn down a sewer pipe.G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #37 (July 1985) Another instance was in G.I. Joe issues #68-71. Crazylegs, Wild Bill and Maverick were forced into evacuating several Dreadnoks out of Rio Vista, the capital of war-torn Sierra Gordo.

The IMAM Ro.63 was of mixed construction with wood, fabric and metal used for the fuselage and wings. It first flew in June 1940, just at the outbreak of World War II. It was put into competition with another Italian aircraft, but clearly proved superior. It had STOL capabilities similar to the Fi.156, but the larger fuselage held up to four people, and the wings held more fuel. The Hirth HM 508 engine and constant speed propeller helped to give it a maximum speed of and almost range. However, there was no defensive armament, as the Fi 156 had from the C version onwards. The aircraft, designed by Giovanni Galasso, and tested by Aldo Ligab√≤, could have been a success, but although 150 were ordered, only six were produced from mid-1940 to 1941, due of the shortage of available engines, the Italian engine industry having failed to produce enough suitable Isotta Fraschini Beta engines. The Ro.63 was a viable machine that was not put into production in significant numbers (practically only a pre-series production) despite the fact that development was completed pre-war. They were doomed by lack of Italian-built engines. The performance was better than the Fi 156, with a superior speed and endurance, and only slightly inferior STOL capabilities. This was due to the more powerful engine and the two-speed propeller. Operational service thumbThe aircraft was deployed in the North African Campaign, together with 30 Fieseler Fi 156 imported from Germany, even though this was insufficient to replace the IMAM Ro.37 and older reconnaissance aircraft. By 1943, after two years hard service, only one Ro.63 survived. In 1948 it was proposed to resume production, but lack of capacity and data about the aircraft meant that the project was eventually abandoned. Other STOL aircraft Other STOL aircraft in the same competition as the Ro.63 included the AVIS C.4 and Caproni GDL. The Avis C.4 had a good performance but suffered from poor flying characteristics. The Caproni GDL, was not completed.

In Ballinspittle, County Cork, in July 1985, an observer claimed to have seen a roadside statue of the Virgin Mary move spontaneously.\\"The Miracle at Ballinspittle.\\" Granta 23, Spring 1988 Similar occurrences were reported shortly afterward in Mount Melleray, County Waterford, and at around 30 other locations around the country. They were not all Marian apparitions. Some involved other divine figures and/or saints who appeared in stains on church walls etc. Thousands gathered at many of the sites out of curiosity or to gaze in wonder and to pray. Up to 100,000 were said to have visited the Ballinspittle site alone.Mulholland, Peter. (2008) ‚ÄòMoving Statues and Concrete Thinking‚Äô. Quaderns de l'Institut Catal√† d'Antropologia: s√®rie monogr√†fics 23. The Catholic Church remained reticent or highly skeptical and a bishop declared the whole phenomenon 'an illusion'. The Ballinspittle statue was damaged by a gang of hammer-wielding Pentecostalist protesters against idolatry (or Mariolatry), but it was repaired. In 2002 the BBC planned a documentary on the phenomenon.\\"BBC to pay homage to the moving statues phenomenon\\" Though the moving statue phenomenon quickly faded, a few small 'cults' persisted for some years after the peak activity of 1985, and one set off by road to convert Russia.Allen, M.

Vose set out to see for himself in his book The Statues That Moved a Nation.The Statues That Moved a Nation He interviewed witnesses who told him the most amazing stories of miraculous happenings. A team of psychologists based in University College, Cork (UCC), recorded 31 apparition sites and explained the visions as being optical illusions caused by staring at objects in the evening twilight.Ryan, T. and Jurek Kirakowski (1985) Ballinspittle: Moving Statues and Faith. Cork and Dublin: Mercier Press Others have argued that the moving statues and other extraordinary international phenomenon like the \\"flying-saucer\\" religions and many other new religious and occult movements are best explained as responses to an existential angst that was exacerbated by the Cold War and other sources of social stress but with ultimate origins in cultural or religious norms, family dynamics, and personal psychology. One site is about one kilometre (1000 yards) along the Ballinspittle to Kinsale road. In a ravine the life-sized blue-and white painted plaster statue of a woman stands about 4 metres (13') above the road, fronted by a balustrade of large blue concrete letters reading \\"I am The Immaculate Conception\\". The head of the statue is surrounded by small electric bulbs in the form of a halo. Across the ravine is an unfenced grassy slope with some benches. In front is a blue boilerplate box for donations, secured by two large padlocks. A printed notice beside the grotto states that its continual upkeep is designed to keep the people of Ballinspittle focused on their veneration of the Virgin Mary, and also to inspire faith in \\"mere passers by\\". Anthropologist Peter Mulholland argues that the continuing role of Marian apparitions in Irish popular culture is a reflection of psychological insecurity stemming largely from adverse childhood experiences and a concatenation of historical, cultural, political, religious and sociological factors.Mulholland, Peter, \\"Marian apparitions, the New Age and the FAS prophet\\". 53 - 73 in Olivia Cosgrove et al.

The process of a Jew becoming more observant of Orthodox Judaism is called teshuva (\\"return\\" in Hebrew) making the \\"returnee\\" a baal teshuva (\\"master of return\\"). Orthodox Jewish outreach has worked to enhance the rise of the baal teshuva movement. Varieties=Haredi The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the founding of the non-Hasidic, Haredi institutions that eventually became the Aish HaTorah, Ohr Somayach, and Machon Shlomo yeshivas. Rabbi Noah Weinberg was one of the pioneers of this movement with Aish HaTorah. Ohr Somayach has also played a major role in the baal teshuva movement through its education of generations of students. The world's first baal teshuva yeshiva for men was Hadar Hatorah which opened in New York in 1962 under Rabbi Yisroel Jacobson, and continues to operate today. Other baal teshuva yeshivas include the Diaspora Yeshiva, founded by Rabbi Mordechai Goldstein in Jerusalem's Old City in 1967, and Dvar Yerushalayim, established in 1970. Baal teshuva yeshivas for women include Neve Yerushalayim, founded in 1970, and EYAHT, affiliated with Aish HaTorah and founded in 1982. Concurrent with the opening of baal teshuva learning programs in Israel in the 1970s, a small number of Orthodox outreach workers began approaching English-speaking, college-age students visiting the Western Wall and inviting them to experience a Shabbat meal with a host family or to check out one of the baal teshuva yeshivas. These outreach workers included Rabbi Meir Schuster, Baruch Levine, and, beginning in 1982, Jeff Seidel. Modern Orthodox Within Modern Orthodox Judaism, the Union of Orthodox Congregations created the National Conference of Synagogue Youth (NCSY) to reach Jewish teenagers in public schools. Founded by Rabbi Pinchas Stolper the movement also developed its in- house literature geared to the newly observant mainly written by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan. = NJOP = In 1987, an organization called National Jewish Outreach Program (NJOP) was founded by Ephraim Buchwald. Chabad Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn, 6th leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch branch of Hasidic Judaism, and then his successor, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson were responsible for turning Chabad's activities toward outreach. Each in turn sent out rabbinic emissaries, known as \\"Shluchim\\", and their wives to settle in places across the world solely for the purpose of teaching those who did not receive a Jewish education or to inspire those who did. The vehicle chosen for this was termed a \\"Chabad house.\\" Since the 1940s, Chabad has been active in reaching out to Jews through its synagogues and communal institutions, as well as more direct outreach efforts, such as its Mitzvah tanks.

Lead-up At the start of the 1981-82 season, Middlesbrough were in the Football League First Division. The season ended with them finishing bottom of the league and being relegated. It has been claimed that the team had been severely weakened by the sales of star players such as Craig Johnston, David Armstrong and Mark Proctor. Dutch midfielder Heini Otto had, however, successfully integrated into the team. In February of that year, Boro chairman Charles Amer and his son Kevin, who was a director, both resigned from the board. George Kitching moved in to take over as chairman but it was his unenviable task (at the club's ninetieth annual meeting in December 1982) to report to shareholders that the club had suffered an annual loss of ¬£307,718. The Manager Bobby Murdoch was asked to resign in September 1982 after poor performances, and Harold Shepherdson was appointed caretaker until a permanent replacement could be installed. After only 6 months as chairman, Kitching resigned and Mike McCullagh took over, with Keith Varley as vice-chairman. The board appointed Malcolm Allison as full-time manager. Allison took the team to a point away from home in his first game in charge but the team only went on to finish 16th. The next season, things continued to decline. Boro's form was poor in both the League and cup (although they were never in serious danger of relegation), but more worryingly for the board the club was getting into serious financial problems. Malcolm Allison was being pressured into off-loading star players to keep the club afloat. Late in March 1984, Allison sensationally claimed that it was \\"better for the club to die than to linger slowly on its deathbed\\", a quote which was swiftly followed by his sacking. Jack Charlton guided the club through the rest of the season, assisted by Willie Maddren, and they finished 17th, a place down on the previous season. Steve Gibson joined the board as a director in November 1984, and Maddren, now appointed as permanent manager, miraculously guided the club to safety in 1984-85. On the last day of the season, the team needed three points to survive, and the team delivered a 2-0 win, leaving the team 19th. McCullagh resigned as chairman and Alf Duffield was installed as chairman. He made the right noises in the press and pleased the fans initially. Middlesbrough desperately needed capital but the opinions of board members were split over the idea to raise ¬£1 million by a public share issue. Gibson realised Duffield didn't have control over the shareholders but he tried to do his best for the club. 1986 With Maddren struggling with results, coach Bruce Rioch was brought in to assist him. However, only six weeks later, Maddren left and Rioch took over full-time. In April 1986, the club had to borrow ¬£30,000 from the Professional Footballers' Association to pay players' wages and things were looking bad. Rioch's strict disciplinary methods had upset senior players and he instead relied on youth. Tensions between Rioch and chairman Duffield grew during the final four weeks of the season and, following an allegedly mighty row during a meeting over dinner, Duffield resigned. Duffield had lent money to the club himself or arranged bank loans which he had secured. Unfortunately, instead of giving the club financial stability, they were only getting further and further into debt. Gibson tried to keep the problems \\"in house\\" but information was leaked to the press about the difficulties soon after. On the pitch, Boro tumbled down into the Third Division for only the second time in their history, after a loss on the final day of the season. Debts were discovered to be bigger than initially thought. ¬£100,000 was still owed to former chairman Charles Amer for construction of the sports hall at Ayresome Park eight years earlier, money for which Amer was planning steps to retrieve. On 21 May 1986, with debts amounting to almost ¬£2 million, the club called in the provisional liquidator. In late July, the Inland Revenue took the club to court. The club owed ¬£115,156 in tax and the judge issued a winding up order. On the second of August, Rioch and twenty-nine other non-playing staff were sacked and the gates to Ayresome Park were padlocked. Some players chose to remain and train under Rioch and coach Colin Todd, while others such as Don O'Riordan and Peter Beagrie (since nicknamed 'Judas' because of this) chose to leave. Gibson's haulage company, Bulkhaul Limited, was expanding and doing well, but he was still relatively new to the business and lacked big time credibility. In order to help salvage the situation, Gibson approached the council for help, who in turn approached ICI. He also contacted Graham Fordy of Scottish & Newcastle. An advert was placed in The Times for help, and Henry Moszkowicz was one of those who replied. The consortium realised the structure of the club had to change and so Gibson approached the board asking for total executive powers. He got his wish, after a heated argument. Gibson reached an agreement with Duffield, who was owed ¬£500,000, that he would wind up the company. Clubs in less serious situations had previously used liquidation to get out of problems, but when it came to Middlesbrough's turn, the Football League showed a lack of support and Gibson claimed they wanted to ‚Äúcrucify a football club, and this small club in the north-east was the one they picked on.‚Äù A problem arose when the council was unable to meet its ¬£200,000 share of the pot, meaning Gibson and Moszkowicz had to raise their inputs. Things continued to work against them. Three days before the start of the season, the league introduced a ruling meaning the club had to have ¬£350,000 in working capital and show it could pay all creditors 100 pence in the pound. The death of the club was then announced on Tyne Tees Television. A meeting with the Football League took place on Friday 22 August. Notes were passed from room to room between the league's representatives and the consortium. Colin Henderson agreed a deal with ICI for a bond, meaning that they would pick up a major part of any subsequent debt, and the consortium put in their ¬£825,000. With ten minutes to spare before the registration deadline, the documents were signed by Graham Fordy, Reg Corbridge and Henry Moszkowicz. In recognition of Henderson's achievements in delivering the bond in a format acceptable to everyone, he was named chairman of Middlesbrough Football & Athletic Company (1986) Ltd., the new company formed by the purchase of Blackplay Ltd., a dead company, off the shelf. Gibson, Fordy, Corbridge and Moszkowicz formed the board. The club had been saved and the deal was announced to the public at the town hall. Aftermath Legal matters continued throughout the 1986-87 season as people came forward to claim old debts, but this was overshadowed by the achievements of Rioch's side on the pitch. The side, which had been relegated the season before, finished second in the table, regaining a place in the Second Division. The following season, the club finished third in the place, winning promotion to the First Division by the play-offs. Although the club would be relegated back to the second flight after the next season, the recovery from such a precarious situation surprised everyone in the football world.

The , 866-ton ship was built as a sail-ship by Sandeman & McLaurin of Glasgow and launched on 21 December 1854. On 3 April 1855 Henderson began a maiden voyage from Glasgow to Bombay. The Anchor Line decided to begin transatlantic service between Glasgow and New York City with Tempest. She was converted to a screw steamship with the fitting, by Randolf and Elder, of engines in 1856. Her first passage left Glasgow on 11 October 1856; sailing from New York on 19 November, she returned to Glasgow after a 28-day crossing. Her second journey departed Glasgow 27 December, mastered by Capt James Morris, with cargo and 50 passengers. She arrived in New York on 1 February. She sailed eastward on 13 February 1857 with crew, cargo and one passenger aboard. Nb. Some sources claim 150 passengers. She vanished without a trace. Her fate remains an unsolved mystery to this day along with the 150 people that were on board. Two other ships of the Anchor Line disappeared at sea; United Kingdom in 1869 and Ismailia in 1873.

Man's shot silk suit, purple warp and green weft, c. 1790 (altered c. 1805). Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Shot silk (also called changeant, changeable silk, changeable taffeta, cross- color, or \\"dhoop chaon\\" (\\"sunshine shade\\")) is a fabric which is made up of silk woven from warp and weft yarns of two or more colours producing an iridescent appearance. A \\"shot\\" is a single throw of the bobbin that carries the weft thread through the warp, and shot silk colours can be described as \\"[warp colour] shot with [weft colour].\\" The weaving technique can also be applied to other fibres such as cotton, linen, and synthetics. History A shot silk vestment of purple and yellow dating from about 698 is described in detail in a document written in about 1170, showing that the technique existed since at least the 7th century.Dodwell, C.R. (1982). Anglo-Saxon Art, A New Perspective. Manchester University Press. pp. 145‚Äì150. . An argument has been made that shot silk was also described as purpura at this time, the Latin word mainly applied to purple although there are multiple references to purpura being red, green and black-and-red, as well as \\"varied\\". Purpura is also used to mean iridescence and the play of light, and contemporary descriptions exist indicating that the textile purpura was a type of silk distinct to other silks in assorted colours. It has also been suggested that illuminations in the Lindisfarne Gospels of c.700 show garments of shot silk being worn by the Four Evangelists. Shot silks were popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, including warp printing, where the warp was printed before weaving to create chin√© or \\"Pompadour taffeta\\". Current use Shot silks are used today to make neckties and other garments. Notably, some forms of academic dress use shot silks, such as those of the University of Wales and the University of Cambridge. For example, the robes of a Cambridge Doctor of Divinity are faced with \\"dove\\" silk, which is turquoise shot with rose-pink to create an overall grey effect.

Cabanes tchanqu√©es on the Isle of Birds, near Arcachon. Arcachon Bay (in French, the Bassin d'Arcachon, and known locally simply as \\"le Bassin\\") is a bay of the Atlantic Ocean on the southwest coast of France, situated in Pays de Buch between the C√¥te d'Argent and the C√¥te des Landes, in the region of Aquitaine. The bay covers an area of 150 km¬≤ at high tide and 40 km¬≤ at low tide. Some of its geological features are natural preservation areas.Nicola Williams, Oliver Berry, Stuart Butler, Jean-Bernard Carillet, Kerry Christiani, Gregor Clark, Emilie Filou, Catherine Le Nevez & Daniel Robinson (2015). Lonely Planet France (Travel Guide) Paperback ‚Äì 13 Mar 2015 by Lonely Planet. The general shape of the Bassin d'Arcachon is that of an equilateral triangle pointing north, the southwest corner of which is open to the sea, between Cap Ferret and the town of Arcachon (more specifically, one of the suburbs of La Teste- de-Buch, Pyla-sur-Mer), through a 3 km narrow channel (Les Passes). On the north shore is the town of Ar√®s, then Andernos-les-Bains on the northeast. Just south of the entrance is The Great Dune of Pyla. Nearly in the middle of the bay is a very particular island: L'√Æle aux Oiseaux (Isle of the Birds). Development Map of the Bassin d'Arcachon Formation of the Bassin d'Arcachon at 4000 BC, 400 BC, 700 AD, 1300 AD, 1708 AD and today. Green areas are mud and sand bars. Beige areas are sand dunes. In the past, similar areas became lakes (called in French lacs or √©tangs) and are nowadays filled with fresh water. On the French Atlantic coast, running north‚Äìsouth between the Gironde estuary to the Adour river mouth, are the Lac d'Hourtin-Carcans, the Lac de Lacanau, the √âtang de Cazaux et de Sanguinet, the √âtang de Biscarrosse et de Parentis, the √âtang d'Aureilhan, the √âtang de L√©on, the √âtang de Soustons, the √âtang Hardy, the √âtang Blanc and the √âtang de Garros. Arcachon Bay is the last water area that remains open to the ocean. The Bassin still has a link to the sea perhaps because of the Eyre River that runs from the Landes forest and has its mouth (Delta de l'Eyre) in its southeast corner. Otherwise the Bassin would have become blocked by the sandbanks built up by the tides.

Pacifics career began on a high note when she set a new transatlantic speed record in her first year of service, but after only five years in operation, the ship along with her entire complement of almost 200 passengers and crew vanished, without a trace, on a voyage from Liverpool to New York City, which began 23 January 1856. Pacifics fate remains a mystery to the present day. A message in a bottle found on the remote island of Uist within the Hebrides (a widespread archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland) in 1861 declared her sunk by icebergs. In 1991, wreckage located in the Irish Sea off the coast of Wales was claimed, without corroboration, as being the SS Pacific. Development For several decades prior to the 1840s, American sailing ships had dominated the transatlantic routes between Europe and the United States. With the coming of oceangoing steamships however, the U.S. lost its dominance as British steamship companies, particularly the government-subsidized Cunard Line, established regular and reliable steam packet services between the U.S. and Britain.Fry, p. 66. In 1847, the U.S. Congress granted a large subsidy to the New York and Liverpool United States Mail Steamship Company (S.S.C.) for the establishment of an American steam-packet service to compete with Britain's Cunard Line.Morrison, pp. 411‚Äì412. With this generous subsidy in hand, the New York and Liverpool S.S.C. ordered four new ships from New York shipyards and established a new shipping line, the Collins Line, to manage them. The Collins Line ships were specifically designed to be larger and faster, and offer a greater degree of passenger comfort, than their Cunard Line counterparts. Design of the ships was entrusted to a noted New York marine architect, George Steers.Morrison, p. 411. Description Diagram of one of Pacifics side-lever engines Pacifics wooden hull was built from yellow pine, with keel and frames of white oak and chestnut. Like her three sister ships, Pacific had straight stems, a single smokestack, three square-rigged masts for auxiliary power, and a flat main deck with two single-story cabins, one fore and one aft. The ships were painted in Collins Line colors: black hull with a dark-red stripe running the length of the ship,Morrison, p. 420. and a black stack with a dark-red top. Pacific was powered by two side-lever engines built by the Allaire Iron Works of New York, each of which had a and , delivering a speed of . The running gear was designed in such a way that if one engine failed, the remaining engine could continue to supply power to both paddlewheels. Steam was supplied by four vertical tubular boilers, with a double row of furnaces, designed by the Line's chief engineer, John Faron.Morrison, p. 412. Fuel consumption was from about of coal per day, and auxiliary sail power was provided by three full-rigged masts. The passenger accommodations were generous and spacious, and the cabins and saloons were elaborately decorated. The ship could initially accommodate 200 first-class passengers; in 1851, accommodations for an additional 80 second-class passengers were added. Customer service innovations on the Collins Line ships included steam heating in the passenger berths, a barber's shop, and a French maitre de cuisine. The ships' high freeboards and straight stems also contributed to passenger comfort by providing added protection from seaspray and a steadier motion through the waves than typical passenger ships of the period.Fox, pp. 120, 124-125. Service history Pacific was launched on 1 February 1849 and made her maiden voyage from New York to Liverpool on 25 May 1850. She would retain service on the New York-Liverpool route for her entire career. Between 11 and 21 September, Pacific made a record passage from Liverpool to New York with an average speed of , breaking the previous record of 12.25 knots held by the Cunard Line's Asia, and thus winning the coveted Blue Riband for fastest transatlantic crossing. Pacific would hold the record for less than a year however, as her sister ship Baltic would set a new record the following August with a new record speed of . Between 10 and 20 May 1851, Pacific also set a new eastbound record with an average speed of 13.03 knots, beating the previous record of 12.38 knots set by the Cunard Line's Canada. Again however, the record would stand for only nine months before being broken again by Pacifics slightly more-powerful sister ship, Arctic.North Atlantic Seaway by N.R.P. Bonsor, vol.1, p.207, as recorded at Ship Descriptions P-Q , The Ships List website. In 1851, Pacifics passenger accommodations were increased to include an additional 80 second-class passengers. In March 1853, Pacific rescued the crew of the barque Jesse Stevens, which had foundered in the Atlantic Ocean.. In 1853, Pacifics mizzen mast was removed, presumably in order to reduce drag. Loss On 23 January 1856, Pacific departed Liverpool for her usual destination of New York, carrying 45 passengers (a typically small number for a winter voyage) and 141 crew. Her commander was Captain Asa Eldridge, a Yarmouth, Cape Cod skipper and navigator of worldwide reputation; in 1854 he had set a trans-Atlantic speed record on the clipper Red Jacket from New York to Liverpool which remains unbroken. After Pacific failed to arrive at New York, other ships were sent to conduct a search, but no trace of the vessel was found. Contemporaries concluded that Pacific had probably hit an iceberg off Newfoundland, as the ice had been particularly bad that year.Fox, pp. 135-136. Captain Eldridge and his chief engineer, Samuel Matthews, were both still new to the Pacific, making only their second roundtrip voyage on her, and some accounts have blamed the disaster on their inexperience. But as a more recent account explains, both had considerable relevant experience: the Pacific was actually the fourth steamer Eldridge had commanded, while Matthews had a long career on other steamships, including another Collins liner whose engines and boilers were identical to the Pacifics.Miles, p. 120. Wyn Craig Wade mentions the missing ship in his 1979 book, The Titanic: End of a Dream. Wade wrote, \\"The only clue in this instance had been a note in a bottle, washed ashore on the west coast of the Hebrides\\" as follows: : On board the Pacific from Liverpool to N.Y. - Ship going down. Confusion on board - icebergs around us on every side. I know I cannot escape. I write the cause of our loss that friends may not live in suspense. The finder will please get it published. W.M. GRAHAM. Author Jim Coogan also mentions the missing vessel in his article \\"A Message from the Sea\\" published in The Barnstable Patriot. Coogan writes that after the bottle was found, \\"on the remote Hebrides island of Uist... in the summer of 1861\\", the passenger list was thoroughly checked by the London Shipping & Mercantile Gazette, \\"and when the passenger list of the ill-fated steamer was examined, it contained the name of William Graham, a British sea captain headed for New York as a passenger to take command there of another vessel.\\"Barnstable Patriot.com Coogan's article goes on to say: : \\"...in 1991, divers found the bow section of the SS Pacific in the Irish Sea only from Liverpool. Other than the claim, there is no other confirmation of the find, nor is it found in any other book... that no wreckage from the lost ship came ashore along the coast of Wales in the aftermath of her disappearance would...make it unlikely the ship foundered so close to Liverpool.\\"Barnstablepatriot.com Supporting this view, a recent book argues that the evidence used to identify the Welsh wreck as the remains of the Pacific is far from conclusive, and that in the absence of further information about that wreck, the note in the bottle that washed ashore in the Hebrides still represents the best explanation of the steamer‚Äôs disappearance.MilesSloan This conclusion is further reinforced by the evidence from more recent dives which found brass plates, cast-iron irons and copper discs dated 1865, 1863 and 1865 respectively. As a result the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales has concluded that the wreck is unlikely to be that of the Pacific.http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/240648/details/unnamed-wreck Among those lost was Bernard O'Reilly, Bishop of Hartford (Connecticut), who was returning to his diocese after an 1855 trip to Europe.

It is a stone building in the Gothic Revival architectural style, considered the best preserved early example of that style in Westchester County. It is also one of the few remaining Calvin Pollard buildings in the state.Village of Ossining, , April 2010, p. 40; retrieved July 12, 2011. Built in the 1830s, it is the oldest house of worship in the village. See also: In 1978 it and its rectory across the street were added to the National Register of Historic Places. The original marble used for the church was quarried by inmates at nearby Sing Sing Prison. In the middle of the 19th century the rectory was added, across the street, and the church expanded. One of those architectural additions, a spire was removed in the mid-20th century. Shortly thereafter, the original Episcopal congregation moved out and sold the building to the new Calvary Baptist Church, which has occupied it ever since. Buildings The church and rectory (now used as an annex) are on, respectively, the north and south sides of St. Paul's Place between State and Spring streets in downtown Ossining. Ossining's late-20th-century post office is to the northwest; across from it are the buildings of the Main Street crescent in the Downtown Ossining Historic District. There is a large building to the east of the church; otherwise, the only immediate neighbors are parking lots as the downtown area gives way to residential neighborhoods in all directions other than north. The land slopes gently down towards the steep bluff overlooking the Hudson River to the west. The main building itself is a one-story three-by-four-bay structure faced in rough-cut Sing Sing marble with smooth stone used for trim. A square bell tower rises from the south (front) end. On the north is a small brick chancel with a brick chimney on the west; a small concrete block shed is attached to the east wall.Significant Sites and Structures, 41. Every corner of the facades is buttressed. The south features blank label-molded pointed arched niches on either side of the tower. On either side of the nave are three pointed-arched stained-glass windows with simple tracery; above double- hung windows with diamond-shaped mullions. In the rear of the chancel is a single large Tudor arched stained-glass window with two narrow sash windows on the east; above it the main block has a small round oculus. On the inside the church has exposed wooden roof trusses, the stained glass windows, and a large pointed chancel arch. Stone steps with metal railings rise to the tower, with entrances on all three sides. All are double wooden doors in blind pointed arches with decorative woodwork paneled transoms. The east and west entrance rise to the same level as the tower's lowest buttress; the south entrance reaches the same level as the flanking niches. From the lower buttress another buttress rises to a level parallel with a cornice at the roofline on the side faces. The cornice does not continue onto the south facer of the tower; it is replaced by a centrally located shield-shaped stone commemorative plaque reading \\"St. Paul's Church, A.D. MDCCCXXXV\\". Above it is another cornice at the top of the roof, setting off a final stage with a narrow pointed-arch louvered vent in the center of each face. A small cross tops the tower. The rectory across the street is a two-and-a-half-story three-bay brick residence with a one-and-a-half-story wing projecting from the south and a one-story center-gabled porch across the north (front) elevation. It has Gothic detailing similar to that on the church, in particular two-over-two double- hung sash pointed-arched windows. The gabled roof is set off by a simple frieze. Inside it has the original staircase, and intact decorative ceilings and door and window surrounds. History In the 1830s Ossining, then known as Sing Sing, was at its pre-industrial peak. The Croton Turnpike (now New York State Route 133) brought the produce of inland farms to the port along the Hudson River where they could be shipped to New York City and other large markets. Around the docks were shipbuilders and related industries. Inmates at Sing Sing prison, established in 1825, quarried marble for use in local buildings, among other such operations. A growing Episcopal congregation decided it needed its own church. In 1834 it obtained the lot for $800 ($ in modern dollars) from Richard Austin, a wealthy local lawyer whose house, also listed on the National Register, is today a local history museum. For the design, it commissioned Calvin Pollard, a New York City architect who had recently won the design contest for Brooklyn Borough Hall (for which only his foundation was ultimately used), who produced a design in the new Gothic Revival style that used Sing Sing marble. In 1835 it was completed and opened. It grew with the village as the railroad came to the waterfront and industrialized it. In 1859 the chancel was added to the rear. The rectory across the street, added in 1864, was designed to be architecturally sympathetic with the church it faced. In 1870 a spire was added to the top of the bell tower. Weather damaged it in 1951, and it was removed. Shortly afterwards the Episcopalians, reflecting the suburbanization of Ossining, moved to a new church on Ganung Drive in the surrounding Town of Ossining and became St. Paul's on the Hill. Calvary bought the vacant church in 1958 and has remained there.

Designed specifically for the Schneider Trophy competition, the S.5 was the progenitor of a line of racing aircraft that ultimately led to the Supermarine Spitfire. Design and development The Supermarine S.5 was designed by Reginald Mitchell for the 1927 Schneider Trophy. Following the earlier loss of the S.4 before the 1925 Schneider Trophy event Mitchell designed a new all-metal monoplane racer. Unlike the S.4's all- wood structure, the S.5 featured composite construction with the semi- monocoque fuselage mainly duralumin including the engine cowlings. The S.5 had a low, braced wing with spruce spars and spruce-ply ribs and a plywood skin. The wing surface radiators made up of corrugated copper sheets replaced the Lamblin type radiators of the S.4. Three aircraft were built, one with a direct drive 900 hp (671 kW) Napier Lion VIIA engine, and the other two with a geared 875 hp (652 kW) Napier Lion VIIB engine.Lumsden and Heffernan 1989, p. 290. Operational history The first aircraft flew for the first time on 7 June 1927. The S.5s came 1st and 2nd in the 1927 race held at Venice, the winning aircraft (Serial number N220) was flown by Flight Lieutenant S.N Webster at an average speed of 281.66 mph (453.28 km/h).Andrews and Morgan 1987, p.186. One S.5, N221 crashed during an attempt on the world air speed record on 12 March 1928, killing the pilot Flight Lieutenant Samuel Kinkead (who had flown the Gloster IV in the 1927 Schneider Trophy Race). Mitchell decided that the Napier engined aircraft had reached its limits of performance due to the powerplant and for the 1929 Schneider Trophy race, redesigned the aircraft with a new Rolls-Royce engine as the Supermarine S.6. Concern over the unreliability of the Gloster VI, led to the High Speed Flight entering one S.5 (N219) along with the two S.6s for the race. The S.5 flown by Flight Lieutenant D'Arcy Greig finished third in 46 minutes 15 seconds at a speed of 282.11 mph (454.20 km/h), behind the winning S.6 flown by Flying Officer H.R.

The replica, powered by a Continental IO-360, used an all-wood construction and incorporated modifications to the wing to lower the stalling speed, water rudders, a slightly wider cockpit and overall weight reduction to an all-up weight of just 1,500 lb, less than 1/2 that of the S.5.Hall 1976, p. 576.

Designed by New York City architect Emlen Littell, it has had additions and renovations by other well-known architects, such as Frederick Clarke Withers and Richard Upjohn. The interior treatment was done by Tiffany & Co. in the early 20th century. In 1982 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Building The church building is a one-and-a-half-story structure, three bays wide on the south (front) facade, faced in rough-cut stone. A three-and-a-half-story high tower topped with a broach spire rises from the southeast corner. The side elevations have stained glass clerestory windows. At the main entrance, heavy wooden doors hang on strap hinges inside a small projecting portico. Inside, much of the original interior remains, including woodwork, furniture, doors and hardware. History St. Paul's was organized by a group of local businessmen who first met in September 1835 and elected wardens and vestry. Two years later, they built a Greek Revival church, partially funded by Manhattan's Trinity Church on the site of the present one. The Panic of 1837 and the ensuing lean economic times strained the church's finances enough that it seriously considered closing in 1842. It did not, and in 1846 hired Dr. Albert Traver, a rector who pioneered in diversity and multiculturalism by accepting the job only if he could continue his work ministering to German immigrants in the Town of Clinton nearby, in rural northern Dutchess County, one Sunday a month. By 1870 the congregation's growth had been such that they decided a bigger building was needed, and hired New York City architect Emlen Littell to design a new building. He obliged with a Norman-Gothic Revival structure to be built of native stone. William Harlow, a former mayor of the city who would later build Harlow Row downtown, was hired as the builder. It was completed and consecrated three years later. At that time it was a smaller building, lacking the current south transept, narthex and bell tower. In 1882 Frederick Clarke Withers was hired to design a Tudor Revival church school building on adjacent property. The adjacent Parish House property was added the same year. Ten years later the south transept and gallery were added, based on designs by Richard Upjohn, who had died 14 years earlier. During the first decade of the new century the congregation turned its attention to the interior. In 1906 it accepted a $1,850 ($ in contemporary dollars) bid from Tiffany & Co. to refurbish the sanctuary. Five years later, in 1911, this was completed, with a new lectern, pulpit, credence table and church doors added, as well as electric lighting. The church's growth continued through the 20th century, and in 1956 a building committee considered what to do about the increasing need for more church school space. A new education building was constructed, and Withers' 1882 building was demolished in the early 1960s. Community programs, including a soup kitchen, use the new building today. In the 1960s, the church began to lose members as congregants moved from the city out to the suburbs. A new rector, The Rev. Robert Leather, reached out to the communities that remained in the city's poorer northern neighborhoods by allowing programs like Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous to use the church's space, and continuing the soup kitchen, now known as the Lunch Box. A congregant established a thrift shop in the church's undercroft in 1979 to pay for maintenance of the parking lot. It continues to operate today under the name Small Blessings. A 2003 fire slightly damaged the church. It has since been repaired.

El Abra is situated in the east of the municipality Zipaquir√° extending to the westernmost part of Tocancip√° in the department of Cundinamarca, Colombia. The several hundred metres long series of rock shelters is in the north of the Bogot√° savanna on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes at an altitude of . The rock shelter and cave system is one of the first evidences of human settlement in the Americas, dated at 12,400 ¬± 160 years BP. The site was used by the hunter-gatherers of the Late Pleistocene epoch.  Etymology  The name El Abra is taken from a large hacienda of that name at the foot of the western portion of the rock formation. The eastern side of the outcropping sandstones is accessible. Climbing activities at these Rocas de Sevilla are organised.  Stratigraphy  The first research in the place was conducted in 1967, and the stratigraphy of lithic instruments, bones and vegetal charcoal with radiocarbon dating established the date of the settlement in 12,400 ¬± 160 years BP. Nivel Paleoindio. Abrigos rocosos del Tequendama G√≥mez Mej√≠a, 2012, p.153  Archaeological research  In the late 1960s, the Indiana University collaborated in a deeper research. In 1970, the Dutch Foundation for the Advancement of Tropical Research (NWO-WOTRO) discovered four new preceramic sites and the analysis of lacustrine sediments allowed a more accurate understanding of the paleoclimate and flora.  F√∫quene stadial  The F√∫quene stadial, named after Lake F√∫quene, close to the village of the same name, is defined from 15,000 to 12,500 BP. It is characterized by a cold climate, flora typical of p√°ramo ecosystems, and lithic tools.  Guantiv√° interstadial  About 12,500 years ago, a gradual rise of temperature allowed the return of Andean cloud forest and the settlement of many animal species, making hunting easier. Artefacts of this period are called abriense: flint (tool)s, and chopper cores. As the climate was more benign, the cave system was gradually abandoned.  Tibit√≥ stadial  The excavations of this period, near Tocancip√° at Tibit√≥, dated at 11,400 years BP, show lithic instruments, bone tools and remains of Pleistocene megafauna, such as mastodons (Haplomastodon waringi and Cuvieronius hyodon), American horse (Equus amerhipuus lasallei), and deer (Odocoileus virginianus) with traces of ritual ceremonies.  El Abra stadial  Dated 11,000 BP, it is characterized by a new cooling of the climate, recession of the forests and a last period of extending glaciations. From this period the archaeological site of Tequendama in Soacha shows lithic instruments (Tequendamenses tools) with a more smooth manufacture, many of them made with materials brought to this place from the Magdalena River valley, such as quartzite. At Tequendama, evidence for domestication of guinea pigs has been uncovered.  Holocene  Around 10,000 years BP, the last glaciation ended and the Andean forests appeared again. The lithic instruments show a rise in recollecting activities, with rodents and vegetables consumed, and lower amounts of large animals hunted. The El Abra caves were abandoned gradually, while other nearby rock shelters like Nemoc√≥n and open area settlements as Checua were populated.  Aguazuque  In Aguazuque, around 5,000 BP, agriculture was established on elevated terraces, grinding stone instruments can be observed in association with itinerant habits. The abriense type instruments disappear.  Tourism  While access to the western Zipaquir√° part of the rock formation is restricted as it is located on private lands, the eastern area in Tocancip√° is accessible and around 20 climbing routes have been constructed. The climbing is comparable but more challenging than the famous routes of Suesca, due to the overhanging character of the formation.

The sealant begins as a liquid, is then injected into cavities which need to be sealed, and polymerises, causing it to harden.  Process  Rhoca- Gil consists of two fluids, that are mixed, thinned out with water and then sprayed into cracks in the bedrock. One of the fluids contains acrylamide and methylolacrylamide. The mixed solution becomes a viscous fluid that penetrates cracks and holes in the rock, where the fluid reacts‚Äîpolymerizes‚Äîto a tight plastic substance. When it is completely polymerized it is stable and will not exhaust any toxic compounds.  Controversies  In 1992 construction of the Hallands√•s tunnel in Sweden began, with opening plans for 1995. Groundwater leaking into the tunnel was however a major problem, slowing the progress, and Rhoca-Gil was used. In 1997, fish and local cattle started dying as a result of Rhoca-Gil in its liquid form leaking into the water supply, contaminating it with acrylamide, a known carcinogen and mutagen. Furthermore, the contamination of the area led to a ban on agricultural products from the area, as well as a ban on using water from the area affecting local residents. The main contractor, Skanska, along with Rh√¥ne-Poulenc and the Swedish Rail Administration had criminal charges brought against them. Some senior executives resigned. Construction was halted in late 1997. The main critique of the use of Rhoca-Gil was against Rh√¥ne-Poulenc for not pointing out the risks of using the sealant, as well as against Skanska for not informing local residents about the usage of Rhoca-Gil. A similar incident occurred at the construction of Gardermobanen in Norway, leading to a ban of the substance in Norway in 1997.

It is home to one of the oldest congregations in the city. In 1979, the church and two outbuildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places. Seven years later, when the Central Troy Historic District was created and added to the Register, it was listed as a contributing property. St. Paul's is one of the oldest churches in Troy; the first Episcopal services were held in 1795. In 1804 St. Paul's was incorporated and a brick church erected. This was replaced in 1827-28 with the current structure. The exterior is a close copy of Trinity Church, New Haven, Connecticut (1813-1816), designed by the architect Ithiel Town in the Gothic revival style. Indeed, due to changes in the original, St Paul's is closer to Trinity's original appearance than Trinity itself. Today, the exterior of St Paul's is remarkably unchanged, but the interior underwent complete redesign in the 1890s. Balconies had caused structural problems, and the Rector, Dr. Edgar Enos, convinced the church to fund a complete interior renovation by the Louis Comfort Tiffany Company. St. Paul's is unusual because all aspects of the design are based on a concept by the Tiffany Company: chandeliers, glass mosaics, tile work, a glass jeweled altar rail, a baptistery of wood and plaster filigree, decorative stenciling of the ceiling, walls and organ pipes, pews and support members, stunning windows by Tiffany and Tiffany artisan J.A. Holzer - indeed, nearly all interior elements. As such it is a fully integrated interior design; only four such churches done by the Tiffany Company have survived intact, and St. Paul's is arguably the finest expression of this concept. Church complex There are three buildings on the church's lot. The church is supplemented by the Guild House to the east, and the Martha Memorial House attached to the northeast corner serves as the parish offices. The church itself is rectangular in shape, five bays long by three wide. It is faced in limestone blocks laid in a random ashlar pattern with dressed pilasters at the corners. There are five lancet windows along the south profile and four along the north. Both the west and east facades have three similar windows apiece. A horizontal course connects all the north and south windows at the lancet's spring. The roofline is marked by a decorated wooden cornice. A hundred-foot-high (30 m) tower rises from 12 feet (4 m) above the main entrance on the western facade. Inside its crenellated top is a bell. The front entrance doubles as the Wayside Chapel. Inside the plate glass doors, the church's sanctuary divides its pews with three aisles. Chandeliers illuminate each section, and a colored -glass lamp hangs over the altar. The high ceiling is supported with wooden trusses; they and the clerestory screens are carved and decorated with gold-tone aluminum leaf. The Guild House, originally the Parish House, is a three-story three-bay limestone building meant to be sympathetic to the church to its west. Its interior woodwork and windows are original, although other renovations have taken place. The Martha Memorial House is similar in size and shape but faced in brick. It has been more extensively modernized, but a second-floor chapel is intact as are its windows, woodwork and a staircase. Aesthetics File:Stained glass window inside St. Paul's in Troy NY.jpgAngelic stained glass window File:Another_stained_glass_window_inside_St._Paul's_in_Troy_NY.jpgTiffany decoration File:View_of_the_pews_inside_St._Paul's_in_Troy_NY.jpgView of the interior The building's original decoration was believed at the time to be consistent with a house of worship. It also shows the influence of 16th- century English churches and, in its rough surfacing and irregular masonry, a touch of the contemporary Picturesque styling. It resembles Town's Trinity Church in every way save the use of a different stone in a different color. Since Trinity's tower has been replaced since it was built, it now reflects the original appearance of Trinity more than Trinity itself does. The Tiffany redesign and renovation have created a remarkable example of an integrated high Victorian interior. History The original church at Third and Congress Streets Engraving of the current church in 1876 The congregation was organized in 1795, not long after the city itself was first incorporated as a village. With financial support from New York City's Trinity Church, and the leadership of its first rector, the Rev. David Butler, it built its first church in 1804 at what is now the intersection of Third and Congress streets. That building was noted in 1818 as having the city's only organ. In 1826, its membership swelling due to the rapid growth of what was now a city, the congregation commissioned the new building. The contract specified that the new church was to be a copy of Ithiel Town's Trinity Church in New Haven, Connecticut, finished in 1817, except where otherwise noted. The only significant difference between the two was their facing: Trinity used brown granite whereas St. Paul's used blue-gray limestone quarried in nearby Amsterdam. Ground was broken in 1826; the church was in use two years later. In the years after the Civil War the church began renovations, starting with the Parish House, now the Guild House, in 1869. The battlements and pinnacles on the cornices were removed, and the bell tower modified, when a new bell was installed in the 1870s. In 1881, the construction of Martha House (to which a second story was added six years later), originally a residence for the nuns associated with the church, cost it the easternmost window on the northern profile. Otherwise, the exterior is as it originally was. On the inside, a brass pulpit and new marble were added later in the 1880s. These led to the major renovations to the interior early in the 1890s, after money was raised to fix structural problems from the original construction. Hidden steel pillars shored up the church, and the ceiling was opened up, its trusses now visible. The rector at the time had recently returned from a tour of Europe's great Gothic churches, and so Louis Comfort Tiffany's company was hired to redecorate the interior afterwards, adding much of the glass and woodwork done by local craftsmen to Tiffany's designs. The stained glass windows were added shortly afterwards. The 20th century saw a few more changes. A third story was added to Guild House in 1914. The church itself got its current organ in 1921, the Wayside Chapel in the 1940s, and the glass doors in the 1960s.

It is located at the northwest corner of Huguenot Street (also known as the Boston Post Road) and Division Street. This church represents the body of the majority group of New Rochelle's founding Huguenot French Calvinistic congregation that conformed to the liturgy of the established Church of England in June 1709. King George III gave Trinity its first charter in 1762. After the American Revolutionary War, Trinity became a parish of the Protestant Episcopal Church of America. The present building is the third church erected by the conformist congregation. It is the immediate successor of a wooden church building erected in 1823 - 1824. It stands on land that was conveyed to the church wardens by Aman Guion in 1743. The cornerstone was laid on August 13, 1862, the church was opened for worship September 13, 1863, and the tower completed November 30, 1864. The church was designed by Richard Upjohn & Son, known for their gothic revival architecture. A parish house was added on the western side of the church in 1892. Constructed of the same granite and brownstone materials as the church, the structure was designed by architect F. Carlos Merry, who also designed the New Rochelle Trust building on Main Street.  Church heirlooms  Within the stone walls of the church are a number of artifacts, or 'heirlooms', that have been handed down through generations of this 300-year-old congregation. They highlight the long history of the church and of the New Rochelle community. A silver chalice presented to the church by Queen Anne of England, received after its conformation to the Church of England in 1709, is inscribed \\"Anne Regina\\". The stained glass windows in the chancel are memorials to Rev. Bondet, Rev. Pierre Stouppe and Rev. Michael Houdin, Trinity's first three ministers. Many other stained glass windows, some of which were crafted by Tiffany, grace the church. The 19th and 20th century congregants, for whom the windows were dedicated, include such names as Iselin, Weyman, Davenport, Thorne and Lathers. The old bell originally in the French Huguenot Church, Eglise du St. Esperit, on Pine Street in New York City, is preserved as a relic in the tower room. In 1823, it was presented to Trinity Church, New Rochelle, and hung up in the tower of the wooden church erected in 1823 - 1824. Huguenot Burying Ground The grounds of the church and the Parish House has a rich history that spans three centuries. On Trinity's land, three former town cemeteries now exist as one. Beginning with the first burial, that of James Bertine's daughter in 1802, a cemetery was established just west of the present Parish House and became known as the \\"Trinity Graveyard\\". Just north of the church site was the private burial ground of the Allaire family, founding members of the community. A monument to \\"Alexander the Huguenot\\" marked the plot and the grave of its first burial. Captain Allaire died in 1782, and his descendants continued to be buried in the family plot until the 1940s. The third and oldest cemetery, the Huguenot Burying Ground, was located just beyond the Allaire's at the southwest side of Division Street at the corner of Union Avenue. The plot was part of the farm of Louis Bongrand, one of the first Huguenot settlers of the Town. In 1693 he gave the plot to the future residents of New Rochelle for a churchyard to bury their dead.Town Records of New Rochelle 1699 - 1828, Jeanne A. Forbes, The Paragraph Press 1916, page.112 The land southeast of the plot was eventually acquired by Trinity Church and all boundaries between the three cemeteries were erased. The arrival of the New York-New Haven railway line in 1849 had carved its way through the village, physically splitting the two once more. A large tract church land had been acquired by Westchester County which ran along the north side of the right of way of the railroad for the route of the projected Pelham-Port Chester Parkway. Although the parkway had not yet been built, the purchase required to removal of the bodies and tombstones from it to the church land on the south side of the railroad. The old burial ground had become otherwise nearly obliterated due to a long period of neglect, the destruction of headstones, and the laying out of new plots over older, unmarked ones. By the time of construction of the New England Thruway in 1956, just one of the final resting places was left to remain, with the Huguenot Burying Ground and the Allaire family cemetery being eliminated for the new six-lane highway. After much litigation and negotiation, the graves of the two cemeteries were removed, an endeavor paid for by the New England Thruway, and coordinated by Rev. Philip M. Styles of Trinity Church. The early New Rochelleans and their descendants were dug up, placed in special boxes and reburied on the church's land.

In an engraved map from the year 1596, Hollingstedt is indicated as port of embarkation. During Viking times, Hollingstedt served as a transhipment port for a ten mile portage to Hedeby on the Schlei inlet of the Baltic, cutting short a long and perilous circumnavigation of the Jutland Peninsula. North Sea tides reached as far as Hollingstedt, so larger vessels were able to navigate the river, until a dam at Koldenb√ºttel closed off the Treene in 1570. In the year 826, Ansgar, Apostle of the North, accompanied by Viking King Harald Klak coming from Mainz where Harald had been baptized, went ashore here on their way to Hedeby.

The painting is in oil on an oak panel, measures 62.4 by 45.5 cm. It shows a grotesque old woman with wrinkled skin and withered breasts. She wears the aristocratic horned headdress of her youth, out of fashion by the time of the painting, and holds in her right hand a red flower, then a symbol of engagement, indicating that she is trying to attract a suitor. However, it has been described as a bud that will 'likely never blossom'. The work is Matsys' best-known painting. The painting was long thought to have been derived from a putative lost work by Leonardo da Vinci, on the basis of its striking resemblance to two caricature drawings of heads commonly attributed to the Italian artist. However the caricatures are now thought to be based on the work of Matsys, who is known to have exchanged drawings with Leonardo. A possible literary influence is Erasmus's essay In Praise of Folly (1511), which satirizes women who \\"still play the coquette\\", \\"cannot tear themselves away from their mirrors\\" and \\"do not hesitate to exhibit their repulsive withered breasts\\". The woman has been often identified as Margaret, Countess of Tyrol, claimed by her enemies to be ugly; however, she had died 150 years earlier. The painting is in the collection of the National Gallery in London, to which it was bequeathed by Jenny Louisa Roberta Blaker in 1947. It was originally half of a diptych, with a Portrait of an Old Man, in the Mus√©e Jacquemart-Andr√©, Paris, which was lent to the National Gallery in 2008 for an exhibition in which the two paintings were hung side by side. The portrait is thought to be a source for John Tenniel's 1869 illustrations of the Duchess in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. A 1989 article published in the British Medical Journal speculated that the subject might have suffered from Paget's disease, in which the victim's bones enlarge and become deformed. A similar suggestion was made by Michael Baum, emeritus professor of surgery at University College London.

Kuhn argues that this broader appeal made it more difficult for other systems to be proposed.

The glandular-hairy leaves are generally 11‚Äì68 mm long and 3‚Äì21 mm wide. This species produces 1-18 scapes per plant. Inflorescences are 8‚Äì30 cm long and produce pink, mauve, or red flowers that bloom from March to August in their native range. S. semipartitum is endemic to the Kimberley region of Western Australia and northern parts of the Northern Territory. Its typical habitat has been reported as either damp sandy soils in eucalypt woodlands, near creeks in the company of Melaleuca species or on sandstone plateaux with Triodia species. S. semipartitum is distinct within section Debilia because it possesses glandular-hairy leaves.

Biography She was born in M√°laga, Spain, the daughter of an expatriate Scotsman, William Kirkpatrick, a wine merchant and consul of the United States of America, and his Li√®ge-born wife, Marie Fran√ßoise de Grevign√©e, whose sister Catherine married the French diplomat Mathieu de Lesseps. Mar√≠a Manuela Kirkpatrick was brilliant, vivacious and talented. In 1817 she married Don Cipriano de Palafox y Portocarrero, Count de Teba (1785‚Äì1839), afterwards Count de Montijo, Marquis de Algava, and Duke of Granada, Duke of Pe√±aranda, a grandee of Spain, Bonapartist and veteran of the Napoleonic Wars. They had two daughters, and a son, Francisco \\"Paco\\", who died young. Their daughters were Mar√≠a Francisca de Sales (1825‚Äì1860), generally known as \\"Paca\\", who inherited most of the family honours, and Mar√≠a Eugenia, born one year later. In the 1830s Manuela and the girls moved to Paris for their education. There she renewed her association with George William Frederick Villiers, later Earl of Clarendon, who is rumoured to have been her lover. Manuela also continued her friendship with Prosper M√©rim√©e, whom she had met in Spain and who took great interest in the education of the girls. Manuela was M√©rim√©e's source for the story of Carmen. In 1837 Manuela briefly moved to England to further her daughters' education, but soon returned to Paris. After the death of her husband, and perhaps the disappointment of Villiers' marriage to an English lady, Manuela engaged in an extensive social life and pursued her ambition to find suitable husbands for her daughters. In 1844 Paca became the wife of one of the richest men in Europe: Jacobo Luis Fitz-James Stuart y Ventimiglia (1821‚Äì1881), 8th Duke of Berwick, 8th Earl of Tinmouth, 8th Baron Bosworth, 8th Duke of Liria and X√©rica, and 15th Duke of Alba de Tormes. Eug√©nie did even better; guided by her mother and M√©rim√©e, she married Napoleon III, Emperor of the French. Manuela lived long enough to see the rise and fall of the Second French Empire, and died in Carabanchel several months after the death of her grandson Napol√©on, Prince Imperial. Her great- great-granddaughter Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart was the most titled noble in the world. References * Baguley, David. Napoleon III and His Regime: An Extravaganza.

She has had twenty-one No. 1 Christian radio hits, won four Dove Awards, and been nominated for four Grammy Awards. Biography Becker was born in Bay Shore, New York, United States, raised in East Islip, New York, and began playing in coffeehouses while teaching music and taking opera lessons. Having graduated from James Madison University with a degree in communication, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1985, and signed to Sparrow Records as a songwriter; soon after she toured with Rick Cua as a backup singer and sang on Steve Camp's 1986 album One on One. The next year she landed a contract as a solo artist, and released her debut album, Never for Nothing. The single \\"Fight for God\\" was her first hit, and her second LP, The Reckoning, followed with two more hits, \\"Light in the Darkness\\" and \\"Find Me\\". Becker began working with producer Charlie Peacock starting with 1989's Immigrant's Daughter, and a string of successful albums followed, including a Spanish language LP. She won two Dove Awards in 1992, for Rock Album (Simple House) and Rock Song (\\"Simple House\\"). However, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Becker occasionally encountered controversy in the world of Contemporary Christian music because she is a Roman Catholic; some Christian stores refused to carry her album, and her concert appearances were sometimes picketed.Mark Allan Powell, The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music (Hendrickson, 2002), p. 74. Although she was raised in Catholicism, Margaret currently attends a non-denominational church in Nashville, Tennessee. After 1995's Grace, Becker decided to take a sabbatical from the music industry; during this time she wrote a book entitled With New Eyes and wrote editorials for Campus Life magazine. She left Sparrow Records in 2002 but has continued to record since then, both her own albums and for compilation albums. She appears on the albums Sisters (Warner Bros. Records, 1994), Listen to Our Hearts (Sparrow, 1998), Heaven and Earth (Sparrow, 1999), and the New Irish Hymns series (Kingsway Music), and is one of the members of the 1994 collaboration Along the Road along with Susan Ashton and Christine Dent√©. She co-wrote Bob Carlisle's \\"Bridge Between Two Hearts\\". Her second book, Growing Up Together, appeared in 2000; her third, With New Eyes, came out in 2004, and a fourth, Coming Up for Air, was published in 2006. In late 2007, Becker's latest album, Air, was released. Becker gives teaching seminars across the United States. She also produces records for other singers, and in 2006 she wrote a series of columns for CCM Magazine. Becker has also been active in supporting charities such as Habitat for Humanity, Compassion International, and World Vision. Becker has never married and currently lives in Nashville, Tennessee.

In 1915 a silent film adaptation The Firm of Girdlestone was made. Plot summary John Girdlestone owns the firm of Girdlestone. It is a very lucrative business and John Girdlestone and his son Ezra Girdlestone are respected by everyone. Both father and son are cynics and have no other thought but for their business; after giving a donation of ¬£25 for charity, John Girdlestone remarks to himself that it is not a bad \\"investment\\", as it will make a favorable impression on the collector, who is a Member of Parliament, whose influence he hopes to use some day. Ezra, his son, is even more of a cynic, as the elder Girdlestone's cynicism is mitigated by his supposed religiosity. However, he manifests a great acumen for business, sometimes even surpassing his father's sharpness in business matters. A series of disastrous speculations by the elder Girdlestone financially ruins the firm. After keeping the impending bankruptcy a secret from everyone for a time, he tells his son (whom he has fooled with a dummy ledger) about it. The son is disgusted by his father's rashness. They resort to chicanery to save the firm. They plan to send an agent to the Ural mountains who will claim to have found diamond mines. They speculate that the resulting plunge in the prices of diamonds in England and South Africa will force the dealers to get rid of their diamonds quickly at absurdly cheap rates to avoid total financial ruin, which would eventually fall on them if diamonds from the Urals start pouring in the market. They will then step in and buy as many diamonds as their remaining money would allow them. Once their capital is exhausted, their agent will disappear and the discovery that the Ural diamond mines were a hoax would skyrocket the prices of diamonds once again, leaving them rich men. Their plan works perfectly and the prices go down just as they had expected. Ezra Girdlestone travels to South Africa to buy from the dealers there while John Girdlestone starts buying in London. After they spend all their money on diamonds and get ready to call their agent back from the Urals, their plan collapses with the discovery of bona fide diamond mines in South Africa. As a fellow conspirator tells Ezra in South Africa: \\"Russia or no Russia, the prices will not go up!\\" He goes back to England and both of them sell their diamonds cheaply, which leaves them in an even more precarious situation than they already were in. A very old friend of John Girdlestone had entrusted his daughter to him before dying. She was heir to ¬£40,000 which she would inherit upon coming of age. John Girdlestone persuades his son to seduce the girl and marry her so that they could get their hands on the money. Ezra fails miserably not only because he is totally inept in romance, but because the girl is already in love with another man. Having exhausted all their means, John Girdlestone decides on a sinister plan. His friend's will provides that if the girl dies before coming of age, John Girdlestone becomes the sole heir. He plans to murder the girl. His son does not favour this plan, but his father persuades him, telling him that it will make the firm rich again.

Boar taint is found in around 20% of entire male finishing pigs. Skatole may also be detected in gilts, but this is linked with faecal contamination of the skin. Studies show that about 75% of consumers are sensitive to boar taint so it is necessary for pork producers to control it.  Causes  Boar taint is caused by the accumulation of two compoundsandrostenone and skatolein the fat of male pigs. Androstenone (a male pheromone) is produced in the testes as male pigs reach puberty and gives the meat a urine or sweat flavour, while skatole (a byproduct of intestinal bacteria, or bacterial metabolite of the amino acid tryptophan) is produced in both male and female pigs and gives the meat a 'fecal' flavour. However, levels are much higher in intact boars, because testicular steroids inhibit its breakdown by the liver. As a result, skatole accumulates in the fat of male pigs as they mature.  Controlling boar taint  For centuries, pigs have been castrated to prevent boar taint. Castration rates vary from country to country, and most still do not use anesthesia or analgesia when castrating pigs. Commercial farms that do castrate will do so in the pig's first week of life. Another possible method to control boar taint is to use sex sorted semen for artificial insemination. This method has been successfully used in cattle breeding, but the technique is still under research and no economical or practical solution yet exists in pig production. As castration has received criticism in recent years, for welfare reasons, some producers and producer associations are seeking alternative methods to control boar taint.\\"Boar Taint\\" Some producers are breeding out the taint and avoiding the few breeds of pigs that are high in taint. Yorkshire, Hampshire and other lighter-colored pigs are known to be particularly low in the androstenone-based taint while Duroc pigs are high in the taint.  Vaccination  Vaccination against boar taint, which has been used in Australia and New Zealand since 1998, is a solutionJeong J, et al \\"The effects of immunocastration on meat quality and sensory properties of pork loins\\", in Proceedings 20th Int Pig Vet Soc Cong, Durban, South Africa, 2008 that uses the pig's immune system to control boar taint. The use of the vaccine is claimed to be as simple and reliable as physical castration in controlling boar taint. It can be administered by trained farm personnel and enables the production of pork meat that is claimed to be of high quality and to be safe for consumers to eat.Singayan-Fajardo J, et al. \\"Eating quality and acceptability of pork from IMPROVAC immunized boars.\\" In Proceedings 19th Int Pig Vet Soc Cong, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2006 The vaccine works by stimulating the pig's immune system to produce specific antibodies against gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This temporarily inhibits testes function and thus stops the production and accumulation of boar taint‚Äìcausing compounds. By stimulating production of antibodies specific to GnRH, the vaccine stops the chain of events that lead to the release of testosterone and other steroids from the testes, including androstenone, one of the two causes of boar taint. The other major taint-causing compound, skatole, is also eliminated, because the lower steroid levels allow the liver to more efficiently metabolise it. Each pig must be immunised twice to successfully control boar taint. The timing of the first dose is relatively flexible, but there must be a minimum of four weeks between the two doses, with the second taking place four to six weeks before slaughter. After the second dose, the boar's testicles stop growing. The handler should be trained in the use of the vaccine and the vaccinator with enhanced safety features. The vaccine is claimed to offer an animal-friendly and a more environmentally sustainable solution to boar taint, it and to allow getting benefits of natural boar growth while preserving eating quality.Jeong J, et al. \\"The effects of immunocastration on meat quality and sensory properties of pork bellies.\\" In Proceedings 20th Int Pig Vet Soc Cong, Durban, South Africa, 2008Giffin B, et al. \\"Consumer acceptance of the use of vaccination to control boar taint is poor as it is adding one more chemical to the meat.\\" In Proceedings 20th Int Pig Vet Soc Cong, Durban, South Africa, 2008Hennessy D, Newbold R. \\"Consumer attitudes to boar taint and immunocastration: A qualitative study.\\" In Proceedings 18th Int Pig Vet Soc, Hamburg, Germany, 2004Hennessy D. \\"Consumer attitudes to boar taint and immunocastration.\\" In Proceedings 3rd Asian Pig Vet Soc Cong, Wuhan, China, 2007Allison J. \\"IMPROVAC: Consumer acceptance.\\" In Proceedings Pfizer Symposium at 20th Int Pig Vet Soc Cong, Durban, South Africa, 2008Lagerkvist AJ, et al. \\"Swedish consumer preferences for animal welfare and biotech: A choice experiment.\\" AgBioForum 2006;9(1):51‚Äì58 However concerns about the effect of the drugs on animal and consumer health have been expressed. The vaccine will work in multiple mammalian species and is commonly used for contraceptive purposes in zoo animals and oestrus suppression in horses. The vaccine would also work to temporarily prevent sexual function in humans, but no cases of this has ever been recorded.

The major purpose of the Act was to allow burial authorities to establish crematoria. Later revisions of the Act outlawed open air cremations using funeral pyres, although in 2010 the Court of Appeal ruled this practice to be legal under certain circumstances. Background In 1883, eccentric Welshman Dr William Price fathered a child with his housekeeper nearly sixty years his junior. By the time his son ‚Äì named Iesu Grist (Jesus Christ) ‚Äì was born to him in his eighties, Price had taken to wearing a scarlet waistcoat and fox-skin headpiece. He often paraded through the town of Llantrisant carrying a blazing torch and a druid's crescent moon. However, when his son died ‚Äì aged five months, the heartbroken Price took the boy ºs body to a hilltop above Llantrisant on a Sunday. There in full view of the nearby chapel he attempted to cremate the body in paraffin. A furious crowd of locals dragged the body from the flames and nearly killed Price. Later, an autopsy was performed on Iesu's body by a local doctor who concluded that the child had died of natural causes and had not been murdered. Price was therefore not charged with infanticide but was instead tried in a Cardiff courtroom for performing cremation rather than a burial which the police believed to be illegal. Price argued that while the law did not state that cremation was legal, it also did not state that it was illegal. The judge, Justice Stephen, agreed. Price was freed and returned to Llantrisant to find a crowd of supporters cheering for his victory. On 14 March, he was finally able to give his son a cremation involving his own personal druidic prayers. In 1885, the first official cremation took place at Woking, and ten cremations are recorded as being performed in the following year. In 1892 a crematorium opened in Manchester followed by one in Glasgow in 1895 and one in Liverpool in 1896. The case's legal precedent together with the activities of the newly founded Cremation Society of Great Britain led to the Cremation Act of 1902. Legislation The Act deemed that any power to provide for and maintain burial grounds or cemeteries was to be considered to encompass crematoria. No crematorium built could be closer than fifty yards to any public highway, or in the consecrated area of a burial ground. It could not be built within two hundred yards of any dwelling house without the written consent of the owner, lessee and occupier, and the act was not to be interpreted to \\"authorise the burial authority or any person to create or permit a nuisance\\". The Secretary of State was to create regulations for the maintenance and inspection of crematoria, the circumstances in which they could be used, and the creation of a register of such burnings. All statutory provisions relating to the use of burial registers as evidence were to apply to these registers. Any breach of these regulations, or burning of human remains outside of the provisions of the Act, would be liable, on summary conviction, to a penalty of up to fifty pounds. Any person found guilty of wilfully making any false representations in order to procure the burning of human remains would be liable to imprisonment with or without hard labour for up to two years; and any person found guilty of attempting to conceal an offence by attempting to procure the burning of human remains would be liable to imprisonment with or without hard labour for up to five years. The incumbent of a parish was not under any obligation to perform a funeral service for those dying in his parish who were to be cremated; but if he refused to do so, any cleric of the Established Church who was not otherwise disabled from doing so could perform the service at the request of the executor, the persons in charge of the cremation, or the burial authority, with permission from the bishop. The Act applied to England and Wales, and Scotland, but not to Ireland. It came into effect on 1 April 1903. The Act has since been heavily amended, but remains in force. Open air pyres Open air funeral pyres were made illegal in Britain by the 1930 issue of the Cremation Act. Prior to this but after the 1902 Act, open air cremations had occurred in limited numbers, including several Hindu and Sikh soldiers cremated in Brighton, having died after fighting for the British Empire in World War I. The last open air pyre was believed to have occurred in 1934, when the British Government gave special permission to Nepal's ambassador to cremate his wife outdoors in Surrey. In 2006, Davender Ghai, a British citizen and devout Hindu who had arrived from Kenya in 1958, launched a judicial review of the Act after Newcastle-upon-Tyne City Council refused him a permit to conduct open air cremations in Britain in accordance with Hindu religious practices, which require the burning of the body in a sacramental fire in order to secure the future reincarnation of the soul. Ghai, through his multi- faith Newcastle based charity the Anglo-Asian Friendship Society, had been campaigning for open air funerals for people of any faith, arguing there was significant demand from the increasingly aging British Hindu and Sikh communities who, due to the Act, often flew bodies of their relatives abroad for cremation. In July 2006, believing the law did not prohibit pyres, Ghai organised the open air cremation of Rajpal Mehat, an Indian-born Sikh illegal immigrant who was found drowned in a London canal. Subsequent delays in identification meant the body was not fit to be repatriated, and Mehat's relatives asked Ghai to organise the ceremony in accordance with their beliefs. The ceremony, held in a field in Northumbria, was Britain's first open air cremation since 1934. Informed prior to the ceremony, local police initially allowed it to take place, but then said it had been illegal. The Crown Prosecution Service agreed, but ruled a prosecution would not be in the public interest. Shortly afterwards, Ghai launched his judicial review to seek clarification of the law and the council's refusal under the Act. In the review, Ghai argued simultaneously that the Act did not outlaw open air pyres if done under the principles of the Act, i.e. in a properly authorised and private site and without causing public offence or nuisance, and that if it did, this was an infringement of the Human Rights Act 1998, under Articles 8 and 9, specifying citizen's rights to religious freedom and a private and family life, respectively. The British Government, through the Department for Constitutional Affairs (which in 2007 became the Ministry of Justice), backed the council's decision and took an opposition stance during the review, on the basis that open air cremations would offend public decency; that the articles of the human rights were properly limited by the Act due to the wider societal implications of pyres; and latterly, due to environmental concerns arising from the practice of burning materials such as mercury fillings. In seeking permission for his court challenge in 2007, the High Court ruled that \\"the burning of dead bodies in the open air is not necessarily unlawful\\" and allowed Ghai to proceed. In February 2010, the Court of Appeal ruled that, as long as open air pyres took place within a structure of some sort, that the practice would be legal under the existing Act, although there were outstanding planning and environmental regulatory issues to be settled before pyres would actually be possible.

Life  Burr was born in Munroe Falls, Ohio, and moved with his family to Cameron, Missouri when he was 10 years old, where his father opened a hardware store. Having been tutored by his mother, Burr left to study at the Chicago Academy of Design in December 1878, but returned home in April 1879 for good; it would be his only formal training. Burr worked at his father's store, yet never abandoned his art. He enjoyed success early, providing illustrations for Harper's, Scribner's Magazine, Frank Leslie's Weekly, and The Cosmopolitan. In 1892, he began a four-year project illustrating a catalog of Heber R. Bishop's collection of jade antiquities for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This project, producing etchings of over a thousand artifacts, paid well enough for Burr to embark on an extended tour of Europe upon its completion with his wife. Over the next five years, as they traveled in Italy, Germany, and the British Isles, Burr amassed sketches and watercolors that would provide the source material for his copper plate etchings of European scenes. A few years after his return to America, an attack of the flu prompted Burr to move to Denver for the benefit of his health. It was there, during summers spent in a cabin studio in a steep wooded canyon with panoramic views of the Rocky Mountains, that Burr began to concentrate on the work that made him famous. In 1910, he built a brick house and studio at 1325 Logan Street in Denver. The building was purchased by the Woman's Press Club, which continues to own and operate it as a clubhouse. In 1924, the Burrs settled in Phoenix, Arizona, where he would remain for the rest of his life. The change of scenery gave him the opportunity to round out his oeuvre of Western landscapes with expansive views of the Sonoran and Mojave deserts. He and his wife, who died in 1941, are buried in Cameron. Today George Elbert Burr is widely considered to be one of the finest of the early 20th-century American etchers. His prints are in a number of prominent collections including the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the British Museum, the French National Print Collection, Luxembourg Gallery, Victoria and Albert Museum, the New York Public Library, Brooklyn Museum, Museum of Northern Arizona. and the Congressional Library in Washington, D.C.

VII c. 17) was an Act of Parliament of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, given the royal assent on 31 July 1902, in force from 1 April 1903, and repealed in 1951. It regulated the profession of midwifery, requiring certification for midwives and providing a penalty for any woman practising midwifery without certification, with the exception of legally qualified medical practitioners or those giving assistance in emergencies. However, it emphasised that this certification was not certification as a \\"medical practitioner\\", nor did it give standing under the Medical Acts. The Act established a Central Midwives Board, which would regulate the issue of certificates and keep a central register of midwives, as well as regulating any courses of training or examinations, providing a means for the suspension of practitioners, and generally supervising the effective running of the profession. Power to supervise midwives on the local level was given to county and borough councils, who were to report any suspected malpractice to the Board, along with the name of any practising midwife convicted of an offence, and generally to keep records of the local practitioners. These powers could be delegated to a district council (or London metropolitan borough councils). Any woman certified under the Act was to notify her local supervisory authority of her intention to practice each year, on penalty of a fine for any failure to submit a notification or any omission of information on it. Any false representations to obtain a certificate, or any attempts to falsify an entry on the roll of midwives, were a misdemeanour, to be penalised by imprisonment for up to a year with or without hard labour. The Act did not extend to Scotland or to Ireland, and did not in any way apply to qualified medical practitioners. It was repealed by the Midwives Act 1951, although the Board continued to supervise midwifery. In 1983, the Nursing and Midwifery Council took over the duties that the Board had previously executed.

The lake is man-made, the result of sluicing operations that began in 1873 when John Ewing (1844‚Äì1922) formed the St.Bathans Channel Company, to mine the Kildare Hill Gold Claim in St Bathans. His company constructed a tailings channel and introduced hydraulic elevating to work the claim. As this work progressed the Kildare Hill Claim became the site of the deepest hydraulic elevating operation in the world, that would turn a 120-metre hill into a 68-metre hole. Work stopped in 1902 when there was insufficient fall in the tailings channel to carry away the tailings. By 1905 John Ewing was bankrupt as a result of poor investments in other locations. The Kildare Hill Claim was then taken up by the Scandinavian Water Race Company in that year. This company restarted operations and worked the claim until 1932, when it was finally abandoned due to the fear of undermining the town of St Bathans. Natural drainage from the surrounding hills filled the hole with water and created the present day lake. The Blue Lake is a key feature of modern-day St. Bathans and is used for swimming, fishing, bodyboarding, and kayaking.

However, local authorities were given wide powers to grant licenses outside these restrictions. If a lease on a licensed premises expired, causing the license to be surrendered, a new one could be granted to suitable premises in the immediate vicinity. There were also provisions for new licenses in parishes which had had significant increase in population. The granting of licenses to extensions of premises, or the transferral of licenses, was not affected by the act. All premises had to be of a minimum rateable value, which varied from thirty pounds in Dublin and Belfast to ten in rural counties. The Act extended to Ireland only, and was to continue in force until 31 December 1907.

The Act did allow for compulsory membership of a shop club or thrift fund, provided it was registered under the Friendly Societies Act 1896 and certified under this Act.

The Registrar was also to consult with the workforce, and no such society was to be established unless at least three-quarters of the employees desired it. A schedule provided guidelines for the regulations of any certified societies.

It is a red brick building designed in a Gothic Revival style by George Fellowes Prynne and built 1888‚Äì91. It is Grade I listed. Parish All Saints' parish was formed from the western part of the parish of St Luke's, West Norwood and also included a detached part of the parish of St Leonard's Church, Streatham. The area that became All Saints‚Äô parish was largely rural until West Dulwich railway station was opened in 1863. The decades after then were marked by an upsurge in residential development, a large proportion of the new houses being on a substantial scale. In the 1880s, a temporary iron church was erected in Rosendale Road. This was replaced by a permanent structure that was consecrated on 13 November 1897. The 1901 Census recorded the parish's population as 3,665. In the following year it was served by one clergyman and attendance at its services (morning and evening combined) represented 37.3% of the parochial population. Based on statistics from UK censuses, the Diocese of Southwark estimates the population of All Saints‚Äô parish was 5,700 in 2001 and 6,400 in 2011. Building View from the north The church was designed by George Fellowes Prynne, a pupil of George Edmund Street. It stands on a site that slopes dramatically down from Lovelace Road to Rosendale Road. The east end of the church is lofty and the whole church, with the exception of the incomplete west bay, is situated over crypt spaces, which are extensively used by the wider community. The northeast corner of the building has four storeys of accommodation. An enclosed staircase rises to church floor level across the east elevation. The building is vast in scale even though incomplete. The nave was intended to be three bays longer with an apsidal western baptistery. A fl√®che was intended over the chancel arch, flanked by a tall slender tower. Only the base of the fl√®che exists and the present bell turret by JBS Comper of 1952 is a modest substitute. The church is brick built with stone dressings and steep-pitched slated roofs. The aisles have individual double-pitched roofs with deep valley gutters alongside the nave's clerestory. There is a four-bay nave, the west bay being incomplete with no clerestory and what was intended to be a temporary slated gable end. It is flanked by narrow aisles and porches (now used for other purposes). The nave is flanked by the Lady Chapel in the north aisle and All Souls Chapel in the south aisle. The apsidal chancel is enclosed by a narrow ambulatory. To the north the Lady Chapel has its own arcaded chancel with ambulatory. To the south of the chancel the space is occupied by the organ chamber and vestries. In June 1944 a V-1 flying bomb exploded near the church, shattering the stained glass windows and damaging the roof. Services continued in the crypt until the church was restored after the war. On 9 June 2000 fire destroyed the building's interior. Restoration work was completed in April 2006, providing the western end of the church with a modern entrance that contrasts with the Gothic architecture of the remainder of the building. Other uses The church is the home of the Lambeth Orchestra and the Dulwich Symphony Orchestra. After the restoration, a private nursery was installed in the basement.

His paintings and drawings link him to the early 1970s generation of Belgrade painters who turned toward a fundamental experience of nature, reinstating the subject theme in their paintings. Drago Do≈°en was born in Bosnia in 1943. At a very early age, Do≈°en dedicated himself to the art in which he showed a great talent that led him to a high school of art in Sarajevo. Upon the completion of high school, Do≈°en continued his studies in Belgrade, where he spent most of his career and established himself as an artist. He graduated from the Academy of the Applied Arts at the University of Belgrade in 1970. Do≈°en started exhibiting his work in 1975 throughout the former Yugoslavia and other parts of Europe. His work gained attention and it did not take long before his paintings received positive reviews from his fellow artists and the general public. Throughout 20 years of exhibiting in a number of galleries in many countries, Do≈°en managed to sell well over 400 paintings that went to private and public collections. In 1995, Do≈°en moved to New Zealand, where he continued to paint and exhibit his work until 2010, inspired by the new surroundings. Group exhibitions * ULUS (1975‚Äì1994) ‚Äì Belgrade, Serbia * Oktobarski Salon (1975‚Äì1978) ‚Äì Belgrade, Serbia * International Drawing Exhibition ‚Äì Rijeka, Croatia * Briarhouse (1996) ‚Äì Hamilton, New Zealand * Mairangi Art Centre (2003‚Äì2004) ‚Äì Auckland, New Zealand * SOKI Illustration (2004) ‚Äì Korea * Art For Nature (2005) ‚Äì Museum Leeuwenbergh, Utrecht, Netherlands Solo exhibitions * Belgrade, Serbia (1977‚Äì1978) * Tokyo, Japan (1994) * Auckland, new Zealand (2008) Reviews Do≈°en's painting is conceived in the subconscious of perception, more in the sphere of obscure recollections than in clearly defined forms of reality. He develops the perception rather than accepting it as it is, and so the form on his painting seems to be a late coming recognition of something once known but forgotten, something once loved but lost. His scenes take on the allure of a fanciful fabric of forms which reveals the intimate meaning of nature. Remaining faithful to the shape of the subject, Do≈°en defines it through the color value of form, thus achieving a calm but fluid and poetically-expressed atmosphere, an ambient of surrealistic space in which light lavishly showers the subject. Then the temporal element insinuates itself into the scope of the artist's imagination, flowing backwards from the present to the past in an introverted, nostalgic quest for the former life of the painting. More than being emotional or visual, this is truly a return to the spirit, to the spiritual; it is a search for the long-lost experiencing of the \\"painting\\", whose illusion now becomes reality. Remembrance or, more precisely, preconsciousness is transformed into a painting, the object of our observation, but this again has a twofold approach, pure image and symbol. Symbolism, however, is the backdrop of Do≈°en's paintings. The artist's imagination turns the perceivable into the poetic haze of the painting, into the form and content of a new reality in artistic awareness. Do≈°en's scenes are woven from fine pigment, dreams and nostalgia. They are executed in an almost-forgotten watercolour technique that is rather unusual in our day and age. They reflect the minute craftsmanship of the Northern Renaissance, a touching Neo-Classicism that seems to have gone astray in an age of brutality, the persistence of someone who recalls his native soil with enduring love... The fluid, nostalgic ambient of these scenes is brought to life by Do≈°en's ink drawing and watercolours. We can say without exaggeration that Do≈°en has mastered this technique to its pinnacle of perfection. Do≈°en's scenes conjure up an extraordinary atmosphere, a romantic note resting on the dividing line between present-day aspirations and the heritage of the past.

Personality Hotels purchased the building in the early 1980s and in 1985 reopened it after refurbishment as Hotel Union Square. It was extensively renovated in 2008, when a Dashiell Hammett Suite was created in Room 505. The interior design is by Colum McCartan, along with Lisa Sayed, partner of the hotel interior design company Sisterhood of the Traveling Hotels, who designed the Ring In the Kids Suite. Lisa Compagno designed the Dashiell Hammett Suite. There are 131 guest rooms and suites. Dashiell Hammett and Lillian Hellman may have conducted much of their love affair at the hotel, and he booked his bride-to-be Josephine Dolan into a suite there on the night before their 1921 wedding. The hotel is reputedly haunted, particularly Room 207. Some attribute a ghost in that room to Hellman.

He was the son of Edward Clive, 1st Earl of Powis, and his wife Henrietta n√©e Herbert. He was educated at Eton and St John's College, Cambridge, graduating as M.A. in 1806 and being awarded LL.D. by the same university in 1835. He also became an honorary D.C.L. from Oxford University in 1844, the year he also became a Knight of the Garter After 1804, when his father was created Earl of Powis, he was known by the courtesy title of Viscount Clive, his father's second title. In 1806, he became a Member of Parliament for Ludlow, retaining the seat until he inherited the earldom and entered the House of Lords. He was also heir to his uncle George Herbert, 2nd Earl of Powis, who had died unmarried in 1801, and inherited the Powis Castle estates on condition that he assume the name and arms of Herbert only in lieu of those of Clive, which he did by Royal licence on 9 March 1807; other conditions were that he should settle his uncle's large gambling debts and that his father should leave the Clive estates to his younger son, the Hon. Robert Henry Clive. A defender of Church of England interests in Wales, in the Lords he led a successful opposition over 1843 to 1847 to a proposal to unite the sees of Bangor and St Asaph. He was ultimately appointed to a Royal Commission on English and Welsh bishoprics. A sum of ¬£5,000 raised in testimonial to him was devoted to found the Powis Exhibitions to assist Welsh students at Oxford and Cambridge Universities intending to take holy orders. Powis had long service in the yeomanry within Shropshire. In 1807 he was appointed major in command of a troop raised from Ludlow and Bishop's Castle towns, which merged into a larger South Shropshire Yeomanry Cavalry regiment in 1814. He continued under command within the new regiment, to which he succeeded as lieutenant-colonel in 1827. Succeeding his father as Lord-Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire in 1830, Powis played a leading role in the suppression of the Chartist riots of 1839, himself deploying four troops of his own regiment to disperse rioters from Newtown and apprehend some ringleaders while the Montgomeryshire Yeomanry were deployed in other parts of the same county. In addition to his yeomanry regiment, he was colonel commanding the Royal Montgomeryshire Militia from 1846 to his death. In 1812, as Viscount Clive, he served as treasurer of the Salop Infirmary in Shrewsbury. The Earl was a bibliophile who built up by 1816 a book collection in Powis Castle sourced from travels in France, purchased partly from booksellers and partly from an auction of Empress Jos√©phine's library at Malmaison.Powis Castle guidebook. He was elected to the Roxburghe Club in 1828 and became President in 1835, the year he sponsored their publication of The Lyvys of Seyntys (i.e. The Lives of Saints). In 1847, he stood for election as Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, but was defeated by only 117 votes by Albert, Prince Consort. An encourager of canal building in Shropshire and into Montgomeryshire, he was at the time of his death Chairman of the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company. On 9 February 1818, Powis married Lady Lucy Graham, the daughter of James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose, and they had seven children. The Earl of Powis died on 17 January 1848 at Powis Castle after being accidentally shot during a pheasant hunt by one of his sons, the Hon. Robert Charles Herbert. He was buried at St Mary's Parish Church, Welshpool.

In June 2015, the Institute launched a website, the Vital Rates of North American Landbirds, tracking the population of 150 bird species in North America, to raise awareness about the population declines of those species.  Description  Scientists at the institute develop standardized bird monitoring techniques and tools for land managers and researchers studying bird populations, coordinate large-scale networks for monitoring vital rates of birds, conduct original research on the abundance, distribution, and ecology of birds, and convey their findings in scientific papers and reports to public and private land managers. The Institute also trains individuals, organizations, and agencies in the United States and abroad, in effective bird monitoring techniques.

He was active in the United States in the civil rights movements of African Americans and Native Americans in the 1960s and 1970s, serving on the central council of the American Indian Movement (AIM). He returned to working at art while living in New York City. His work has been extensively exhibited. Durham also received the G√ºnther-Peill-Preis (2003), the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Robert Rauschenberg Award (2017), and the 58th Venice Biennale's Golden Lion for lifetime achievement (2019). He has long claimed to be Cherokee but that claim has been denied by tribal representatives: \\"Durham is neither enrolled nor eligible for citizenship in any of the three federally-recognized and historical Cherokee Tribes: the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians of Oklahoma, and the Cherokee Nation.\\" He has \\"no known ties to any Cherokee community\\". Background Jimmie Durham was born on July 10, 1940, in Houston, Harris County, Texas, although he claimed he was born in Nevada County, Arkansas, and Washington, Hempstead County, Arkansas.Johansen 110 His parents are Jerry Loren Durham and Ethel Pauline Simmons Durham, both born in Arkansas and buried in Texas. Durham has claimed to be quarter-blood Cherokee and to have grown up in a Cherokee-speaking community. He was raised in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma, as his father traveled looking for work. According to Cherokee lawyer, justice and law professor Steve Russell, Durham is among \\"professional posers\\" who masquerade as Cherokee and Native American for the purposes of career advancement. Durham is described as having \\"made a career of being Cherokee with no known ties to any Cherokee community, although he has claimed to be Wolf Clan and to have been raised with Cherokee as a first language.\\"Steve Russell, Editorial: \\"Rachel Dolezal Outs Andrea Smith Again; Will Anybody Listen This Time?\\", Indian Country Today Media Network, 1 July 2015, accessed 10 January 2016 In the 1960s Durham became active in theater, performance, and literature related to the civil rights movement in the 1960s. In 1965 he moved to Austin, where he worked at the University of Texas at Austin and started exhibiting his work. His first solo exhibition in Austin was in 1965. In 1969 Durham moved to Geneva, Switzerland, where he studied at L'√âcole des Beaux-Arts. In June 2017, ten Cherokee tribal representatives, artists and scholars published an open letter about Durham, titled, \\"Dear Unsuspecting Public, Jimmie Durham Is a Trickster - Jimmie Durham's indigenous identity has always been a fabrication and remains one\\": > Durham is neither enrolled nor eligible for citizenship in any of the three > federally-recognized and historical Cherokee Tribes: the Eastern Band of > Cherokee Indians, the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians of Oklahoma, > and the Cherokee Nation. These false claims are harmful as they misrepresent > Native people, undermine tribal sovereignty, and trivialize the important > work by legitimate Native artists and cultural leaders. They went on to state that by claiming to exhibit his work as a Cherokee person, Durham is in violation of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act. Some institutions have hosted events to discuss these issues, such as the Walker Art Center and the Whitney Museum of American Art.  Activism  In 1973, Durham returned to the United States and became involved with the American Indian Movement (AIM). From 1973 until 1980 he worked as a political organizer with AIM, becoming a member of the movement's Central Council and representing himself as Native American. Usually he claimed to be Cherokee and wrote on behalf of the organization. In 1974, he attended International Indian Treaty Council (IITC) conference at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.T√≥th 72 He later became chief administrator of the IITCT√≥th 152Johansen 29‚Äì30, 155 and worked toward the United Nations granting the IITC status as a \\"Category II nongovernmental organization observer and consultant under the Economic and Social Council.\\" Durham befriended Winona LaDuke (White Earth Ojibwe) and encouraged her activism.Johansen 165‚Äì169 Paul Chaat Smith (Comanche) and Durham resigned from the IITC and AIM in 1979 over disagreements about AIM's support of Cuba and other Soviet allies.Johansen 155  Art career  Sculpture by Jimmie Durham in Funda√ß√£o de Serralves, 2007, in Porto, Portugal After moving to New York City, Durham focused his attention to visual art. He created sculptures that challenged conventional representations of North American Indians. He exhibited and published essays frequently. From 1981 to 1983 he directed the Foundation for the Community of Artists in New York. In 1983 West End Press published Columbus Day, a book of his poems. His poetry was included in Harper's Anthology of 20th Century Native American Poetry (1988). In 1987 Durham moved to Cuernavaca, Mexico. During his time in Mexico, Durham exhibited widely, including at the Whitney Biennial, documenta IX, Institute of Contemporary Arts, London; Exit Art, the Museum of Modern Art, Antwerp; and the Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels. He also published a number of essays in periodicals, including Art Forum, Art Journal (CAA) and Third Text. In 1993 a collection of his essays, A Certain Lack of Coherence, was published by Kala Press. After several years in Mexico, Durham moved to Europe in 1994, initially relocating to Berlin and then Naples. Since that time, he has focused primarily on the relationship between architecture, monumentality and national narratives. His anti-architectural sculptures, performances and videos seek to liberate architecture's privileged material, stone, from its metaphorical associations with monumentality, stability and permanence. His exhibitions in Europe have included venues such as the Kunstverein Hamburg, FRAC in Reims, Haus Wittgenstein in Vienna, Kunstverein M√ºnchen, and the Venice Biennale, among many others. He participated in A Grain of Dust A Drop of Water: The 5th Gwangju Biennale in 2004. In 2005 Durham co-curated with Richard William Hill The American West, an attack on cowboy and Indian mythology, at Compton Verney, United Kingdom. In 2006 he also had various of his work displayed at the Serralves Foundation, in Porto, Portugal. In 2009, a permanent public art piece by Durham, Serpentine rouge, was installed in Indre, France, along the Loire River. In 2010 Durham presented his Rocks Encouraged in the Portikus exhibition hall in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. In 2016 he was awarded the Goslar Kaiserring. In 1995 Phaidon Press published Jimmie Durham, a comprehensive survey of his art, with contributions by Laura Mulvey, Dirk Snauwaert, and Mark Alice Durant. In 2003, a retrospective of his work, titled From the West Pacific to the East Atlantic, was shown at MAC in Marseille, France and at GEM in The Hague, The Netherlands. In 2009, Durham had a retrospective titled Pierre Rejet√©es... at Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris in Paris, France. In 2012 another retrospective, A Matter of Life and Death and Singing, curated by Bart De Baere and Anders Kreuger, was shown at MuHKA in Antwerp, Belgium. In 2017 the retrospective Jimmie Durham: At the Center of the World, curated by Anne Ellegood, opened at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles and traveled to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, and Remai Modern in Saskatoon. The retrospective reignited debate about Durham's claims of Cherokee ancestry.  Bibliography  * Durham, Jimmie. (1983) Columbus Day. Albuquerque, New Mexico: West End Press. * Durham, Jimmie.

The squadron's operations included launching of the Minotaur I and Minotaur IV and Pegasus rockets; as well as testing the Boeing Interceptor and Minotaur II target vehicles.Vandenberg AFB Fact Sheet: 1st Air and Space Test Squadron , 1 March 2010 (retrieved Dec 16, 2012) The squadron's mission was to provide complete service launch and test operations for current and future space launch vehicles, targets, interceptors and experimental space systems. History=World War II The squadron was established by Headquarters, United States Army Air Corps in early 1940 as the 1st Photographic Squadron. It performed aerial mapping primarily over the northeastern United States prior to the Pearl Harbor Attack using obsolescent cargo and Martin B-10 bombers. After the United States entry into World War II, equipped with Lockheed A-29 Hudsons, Beech C-45 Expeditors and Douglas A-20 Havocs (all in photographic reconnaissance configuration) and performed aerial photography and mapping over uncharted areas of Newfoundland, Labrador and Greenland for development of the Northeast Transport Route for the movement of aircraft, personnel and supplies across the North Atlantic from the United States to Iceland and the United Kingdom. The squadron re-equipped with long-range Consolidated B-24 Liberator reconnaissance aircraft and deployed to Alaska in late 1943, assisting in the establishment of landing fields in the Aleutian Islands; also to map uncharted areas of internal Alaska to establish Lend Lease aircraft emergency landing fields over trans-Alaska route from Ladd Field and Elmendorf Field to Nome. B-29 (operated by squadron 1944-1947) The squadron was relieved from assignment in Alaska and returned to the Continental United States. It deployed to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations across the South Atlantic Transport Route to North Africa in early 1944. It performed aerial surveys and mapping over Sicily; Italy and along the North African Coast and Middle East with B-24s and some Boeing B-17Fs converted to F-9 reconnaissance configuration over non-combat areas. It then deployed to India and China; performing unarmed long-range mapping of remote areas of the China-Burma-India Theater over combat areas in support of ground forces and strategic target identification over Indochina and the Malay Peninsula for follow-up raids by XX Bomber Command operating from India. The unit returned to the United States in late 1944. It was equipped with very long range Boeing B-29 Superfortresses converted to F-13A reconnaissance configuration. It deployed to the Central Pacific Area after the Surrender of Japan and was assigned to the Eighth Air Force. The squadron performed reconnaissance mapping flights over Japan, Korea and China. The B-29s returned to the United States in early 1946 for storage or reassignment; unit largely demobilized on Okinawa, flying some light liaison and courier aircraft. It was inactivated in early 1947 and disbanded on 8 October 1948. Test Operations in the Pacific BQM-34 Firebee being returned to Wallace AFS The squadron replaced the 6400th Test Squadron, which had been organized in 1967, in 1969. It conducted weapons system evaluation, known as COMBAT SAGE, of F-4 aircraft, of F-15 aircraft from 1980, and of F-16 aircraft from 1982, until shortly before inactivation. It also trained visiting aircrews from other Pacific Air Forces units in weapons employment and tactics.

History=1785‚Äì1818 The estate consisted of two farms until it was leased to John Willes in 1785. Willes, a maize farmer of Whitechapel, erected a house, possibly with help from Robert Adam. This house was named College Place and the lake, as mentioned by Willes when he first leased the land from Dulwich College, was beyond the original boundary of the estate. 1818‚Äì1859 After John Willes' death in 1818, solicitor Charles Ranken acquired the property and renamed the house Belair. 1859‚Äì1893 Charles Hutton, a wool merchant and sheriff of London and Middlesex, purchased the remainder of the lease. It would seem that the majority of structural changes occurred during his ownership. North and south wings, together with conservatories and numerous outbuildings were constructed. Eventually, Belair grew to 47 rooms. Hutton lived there with his wife, their eleven children, and ten live-in servants. However, the house fell into disrepair when Hutton's Berlin wool business started to lose money. 1893‚Äì1938 Sir Evan Spicer of Spicer's paper merchants was granted a lease. In his time, the property had a farm with cows, pigs, chickens, ducks and horses. In the coach house by the Gallery Road entrance, there was a coach and horses to take Sir Evan and his family across Dulwich Park to Emmanuel Church in Barry Road on Sundays. The original pump outside the coach house, which was used to water the horses, is still there. Sir Evan Spicer was the last private owner of the Belair Estate. 1938‚Äì1946 Belair was sold by auction after Spicer's death. With the onset of World War II, it again fell into a state of ruin. It was used first as a store, then as premises for the military. 1946‚Äì1980 Southwark Council purchased the lease. The main building had to be rebuilt from ground level, retaining only the original staircase. Completed in 1964, the house was restored as Willes had built it, without the extra wings and conservatories. 1980‚Äì1995 Under council ownership, Belair served a similar purpose to that of a village hall. The facilities were variously used for ballet lessons or as changing rooms. The only maintenance during this time was the painting of the exterior. 1996‚Äì2002 Gary Cady took over the running of Belair House and oversaw a complete refurbishment of the entire building, turning it into a restaurant and bar. 2002‚Äì2004 Sam Hajaj took over Belair House for two years until November 2004. No major work was carried out in this period. 2004‚Äì2013 Ibi Issolah became proprietor and took over Belair House, renaming it Beauberry House. Major refurbishment was done creating two new open-air diners, an outside bar terrace with a 2 am licence (Thursday, Friday, Saturday) and a terrace diner. The first floor was made into a private dining room and bar. The establishment then reopened on St Valentine's Day, 2006. 2013‚Äìpresent Alan Dugard and local resident Arron Curtis took the reins at Beauberry House and returned its name to Belair House. With extensive interior refurbishing, the house was restored to its Georgian heritage. Belair House now features a warm cocktail bar, sumptuous dining room, craft ale house and multipurpose event space. The official opening took place during the festive season of 2013.

Film=Captain America (1944) The 1944 serial Captain America has the main character District Attorney Grant Gardner, who is loosely based on the Marvel character Captain America. His nemesis is the Scarab and his love interest and sidekick is Gail Richards. This version of Captain America does not possess his shield, nor does he seem to have enhanced abilities. Instead, he uses a simple hand gun and does not appear to have any qualms about killing criminals. A major factor is that he is not fighting in World War II, despite the fact that the serial came out in 1944 when the war was still going on, and instead was a typical city vigilante. 3 Dev Adam (1973) Captain America appeared in the 1973 Turkish cult superhero film 3 Dev Adam (3 Giant Men) directed by T. Fikret U√ßak and written by Doƒüan Tamer based on the characters created by Steve Ditko, Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, Joe Simon and Rodolfo Guzm√°n Huerta, featuring Aytekin Akkaya as Captain America and Yavuz Selekman as Santo called to Istanbul on a special mission to stop the villainous Spider-Man and his criminal gang. The film, which went on nationwide general release across the country on November 1, 1973, was completely unauthorized by the copyright owners of the characters depicted. The film was popular and thus spawned other rip-offs of other major Hollywood productions. Captain America (1990) The first feature-length depiction of Captain America was the 1990 film Captain America. Development began when the film rights were purchased by The Cannon Group founders Menahem Golan and Yoram Globus in 1984, with Death Wish helmer Michael Winner to direct. Scripts written by James Silke (Revenge of the Ninja, Sahara), Stan Hey (Auf Wiedersehen, Pet), Stan Lee and Lawrence Block (The Funhouse) were rejected and in 1987, Winner left, replaced by actor-director John Stockwell and a script by Stephen Tolkin. The final film, produced by Golan's 21st Century Film Corporation, was directed by Albert Pyun and starred Matt Salinger in the title role. It depicted the creation of Captain America from weak soldier Steve Rogers, his fight in World War II and subsequent apparent death, his being found decades later frozen in ice, and his realization and comprehension that our enemies from the war are now our allies, as well as the hero's battle against the Red Skull. The film, intended for theatres, was instead primarily released on home video and was a major critical failure. Marvel Cinematic Universe Chris Evans as Captain America as depicted in the film, Captain America: The First Avenger * Chris Evans portrayed Steve Rogers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), The Avengers (2012), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). Evans makes an uncredited cameo appearance in Ant-Man (2015). Costume designer Anna B. Sheppard stated the Captain America's uniform in Captain America: The First Avenger was partly based on that of paratroopers of the era, explaining, \\"I think that the challenge of this costume was that it had to look 40s, that's why certain elements like using leather for the straps and belt, metal buckles and not having too tight a fit were important. Forget spandex!\\" Visual Development Supervisor Ryan Meinerding elaborated, \\"The straps that come off his chest are very similar to the ALICE webbing that was used in Vietnam. Using the straps as the stripes across his torso then seemed like an elegant design solution. In the end, the main design aspects of this suit are meant to be about making it appear soldier-like, functional and tough.\\" * At the end of Avengers: Endgame, an elderly Steve Rogers gives his shield and the mantle of Captain America to Sam Wilson. * In the 2008 film Iron Man, a replica of Captain America's shield can be seen in Tony Stark's (Robert Downey, Jr.) workshop when JARVIS is removing his armor and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) spots him. * In the 2008 film The Incredible Hulk, General Ross (William Hurt) mentions to Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) that there was a World War II program that created a supersoldier serum. The supersoldier serum is shown as well as Dr. Reinstein referenced as its inventor (in the comics, Dr. Reinstein was a pseudonym for Dr. Erskine to avoid Nazi persecution). Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) was involved in an experiment combining the serum with gamma radiation, which resulted in his transformation into the Hulk. Blonsky is then injected with the serum in order to take on the Hulk, the subsequent combination of the serum and Banner's blood transforming Blonsky into the Abomination. In the film's deleted opening, Bruce Banner goes to the Arctic to commit suicide but transforms into the Hulk, smashing a glacier. A buried human figure and shield are visible, who are meant to be Rogers and his shield. * In the 2010 film Iron Man 2, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) discovers an incomplete replica of Captain America's shield inside a box. When he asks Tony Stark if he knows what it is, Tony tells him that it's \\"just what I need\\" and places the Shield underneath his particle collider to level it. There is also a Captain America comic book (which made an appearance in Captain America: The First Avenger) in Howard Stark's crate delivered to Tony from Nick Fury. * The 2013 Marvel One-Shot short film Agent Carter features the exploits of Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) one year after the events of Captain America: The First Avenger, and features a flashback of Carter's final communication with Steve Rogers (Chris Evans). The scene was also shown in the first episode of Agent Carter. *In the 2013 film Thor: The Dark World, Chris Evans makes an uncredited cameo appearance as Loki masquerading as Captain America. Animated *Captain America has been featured in both Ultimate Avengers and Ultimate Avengers 2, an animated direct-to-video series that is an adaptation of the Ultimates produced by Marvel Entertainment and Lions Gate Films, voiced by Justin Gross. The character is based on the Ultimate Captain America and serves as the main protagonist in both films. *In the 2008 direct-to-video film Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow, Captain America and the Black Widow's son, James Rogers, voiced by Noah C. Crawford, is the main protagonist. James is a skilled martial artist like his parents and, by the end of the film, is the de facto leader of the group. He wields a wrist device that projects energy constructs of his fathers shield, but it is destroyed by the Iron Black Widow. James then uses the original shield in the final battle with Ultron. Captain America however was killed by Ultron prior to the events of the film along with the other Avengers (though Vision, Iron Man, and the Hulk are in hiding and Thor is ruler of Asgard). *Captain America appears in the team-up film Iron Man & Captain America: Heroes United, reprised by Roger Craig Smith. *Captain America makes an appearance in Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors, with Roger Craig Smith reprising his role. *Captain America appears in Lego Marvel Super Heroes - Black Panther: Trouble in Wakanda, with Roger Craig Smith reprising his role. Television=1960s animated television series The Marvel Super Heroes. The Marvel Super Heroes (1966): Captain America was one of the five featured superheroes, starring in one \\"Captain America\\" segment a week. They were largely straightforward adaptations of not just the character's solo stories from Tales of Suspense, but also several stories from The Avengers series as well. 1970s * Captain America appeared in two 1979 live-action television movies that aired on CBS: Captain America, which aired January 19, 1979, and Captain America II: Death Too Soon, which was broadcast on November 23, 1979, both starring Reb Brown in the title role. The character differs significantly from the comics in both his origin and his operations. For instance, Steve Rogers is a character in contemporary times whose father was the original Captain America, a 1940s government agent. The very patriotic attitude of Steve's father earned him the nickname Captain America, and his father is spoken of as having been murdered. Rogers, a former Marine now making a modest living as an artist, was inspired by this story to sketch a super-hero. After receiving potentially fatal injuries in an accident, he was administered an experimental chemical called the FLAG--Full Latent Ability Gain--formula (at one point referred to as a \\"super-steroid\\") which not only saves his life but also enhances his body with heightened strength and reflexes. These new abilities lead Dr. Simon Mills (Len Birman), the research biochemist and intelligence official who had told Rogers about his father, to recruit him and give Steve a costume based on his drawing. As Captain America, he also makes significant use of a specialized reconstruction of the van he has been driving, out the rear of which can be launched a modified motorcycle. Its functions include a rocket thrust for a fast start out of the van, a jet boost for increased speed, a setting to allow the bike to be ridden with less noise for stealthier movement and a hang glider structure which can allow the bike to glide to the ground with some forward momentum, although it must be jettisoned upon landing. The bike has a round windshield, described as being made of \\"Jet-Age plastics,\\" with concentric circles that alternate between red and transparent around a centered star, blue in color. He is able to detach this, and he uses it as his shield when he goes on foot. At the end of the first movie, Rogers briefly appears in his father's costume‚Äîmore accurately a uniform‚Äîthat bears a stronger resemblance to the uniform Captain America is seen wearing in the comics, and he wears this uniform in the sequel. * In Captain America II: Death Too Soon, Brown's Steve Rogers is first shown sketching a portrait of a Mrs. Shawn (Susan French), who complains to him about a gang of muggers who have been stealing the proceeds from cashed Social Security checks; she denies having cashed her most recent one. He bids her to do this in order to set a trap for the muggers, and then he springs it as Captain America. In the meantime, a free-lance revolutionary terrorist calling himself General Miguel (Christopher Lee), planning to fight an unspecified war, kidnaps a Professor Ian Ilson (Christopher Cary) and forces him to resume his research in manipulative gerontology. Ilson has managed to formulate both a chemical that accelerates aging and the antidote to the same chemical, and Miguel, posing as the warden of a prison in Oregon near Portland, plans to use the chemicals in question to hold Portland hostage for a multimillion-dollar ransom. Ultimately Brown's Captain America and Lee's General Miguel directly clash face-to-face, and when Miguel throws a glass bottle of the aging accelerant into the air, hoping it will shatter against Captain America's body, the Captain throws his shield into the air, where it shatters the bottle in such a manner that the aging accelerant splashes Miguel instead, aging him literally to death in less than a minute. The telefilm was directed by Ivan Nagy. Both of these films were released on DVD for the first time together in 2011 from Shout! Factory. 1980s * Spider-Man (1981): Guest-starred in one episode, \\"The Capture of Captain America\\".

The Red Skull makes a cameo as well. ** He appeared in the last three episodes of the \\"Six Forgotten Warriors\\" saga. The third provides a flashback scene explaining Captain America's disappearance after World War II: he and the Red Skull were trapped in a dimensional machine for the last 50 years. In the last two episodes Captain America is released from the machine (with the Red Skull), and in the final installment he and the Red Skull fight and are, in the end, trapped in the machine once again. ** In the \\"Secret Wars\\" three-parter, Captain America was one of the heroes Spider-Man selected to lead against the villains, choosing him due to his past experience with the Red Skull. * Captain America was one of several Avengers who made cameo appearances in the second season of the mid-1990s Fantastic Four series. * The Avengers: United They Stand (1999): Captain America appears in one episode, \\"Command Decision\\".

The series was cancelled in preproduction with scripts written, characters designed and a one-minute pitch film produced, because of Marvel's bankruptcy. 2000s * X-Men: Evolution (2000): Captain America and Nick Fury appear in one episode, \\"Operation Rebirth\\". In this episode, Captain America is made into the super soldier during World War II through the use of a stasis tank chamber called \\"Operation Rebirth\\", similar to the comics. He gains incredible physical prowess much like his comic book counterpart, but at a hefty price; a defect in the process causes eventual cellular breakdown, forcing Captain America to be put into stasis until a cure can be found. During World War II, he participates in a joint operation with the Canadian soldier Logan to liberate a POW camp, where he saves a boy named Erik Lehnsherr, the future Magneto. When he begins to break down, he and Logan destroy Project Rebirth's stasis tank so that no one else will have to suffer through his condition. Logan later learns that another one was made and subsequently stolen by Magneto, as it has a fountain of youth-like effect on mutants. The episode ends with Wolverine visiting Captain America's stasis chamber, telling his old comrade that they will find a cure for his condition eventually, and also assuring him that they made a great team in their time. * Captain America appears in The Super Hero Squad Show voiced by Tom Kenny.

The region is part of the larger North Coast AVA and one of California's largest and most climatically diverse wine growing regions. Mendocino County is one of the northernmost commercial wine grape regions in the state with two distinct climate zones separated by the Mendocino Range. Ten American Viticultural Areas have been designated within Mendocino County.H. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 272 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 Mendocino is one of the leading wine growing regions for organically produced wine grapes. Nearly 25% of the acreage in Mendocino County is grown organically. In 2004, the residents of the county voted to become the first GMO-free county in the United States in an initiative that was supported by many of the county's largest wineries. The county's widespread focus on organic viticulture has inspired journalists to describe it as \\"California's organic wine Mecca\\". History The first vineyards in Mendocino County were planted by prospectors from the California Gold Rush who failed to find their fortune and returned to the area as farmers. The name \\"Mendocino\\" comes from the family name of Mendoza in honor of the 16th century Spanish explorer Lorenzo Su√°rez de Mendoza, 4th conde de la Coru√±a who explored the Mendocino coast line and his cousin, Antonio de Mendoza the first viceroy of New Spain. The first vineyards in Mendocino were established in the 1850s in the Redwood Valley by returning farmers who failed to find their wealth and prosperity during the California Gold Rush. Most of these winery operations stayed small and were completely eradicated by the enactment of Prohibition in the United States in the early 20th century. With the commercial production of wine banned, vineyards were ripped out and replaced with tree nut and fruit orchards.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 682-685 Workman Publishing 2001 The oldest continually operating commercial winery in Mendocino County is Parducci Wines founded in 1931 while Prohibition was still in place. Parducci remained the only commercial winery in Mendocino until the late 1960s. Part of this was due to the relative isolation of the region from the major wine market and business center of San Francisco (more than a 100 miles/160 km to the south), which was so pivotal to the development of the wine industries in nearby Napa and Sonoma County. In 1968, Fetzer Vineyards was founded and would eventually grow to be the largest wine producers in the county.A. Domine (ed) Wine pg 815 Ullmann Publishing 2008 Fetzer would also become a leader in steering the viticultural practices of the county towards more sustainable agriculture and organic wine production. Today nearly 25% of all the vineyards in the Mendocino County are certified organic by the California Certified Organic Farmers-the largest percentage of any county in the state of California. In 1971 wine production started in the Anderson Valley region. Approximately half of the wine brands produced in Mendocino County are now based in this Western AVA within Mendocino County. Climate and geography The reaches of the cool Pacific fog is one of the dominant influences in Mendocino County viticulture, particularly in the coastal western regions of the county. Mendocino County has a wide range of viticultural mesoclimates that are influenced by the county's diversity in climatic and geography. On the eastern borders of the county is the Mayacamas Mountains separating it from nearby Lake County and the influences of the large Clear Lake. Within the county, the Mendocino Range segment of the larger California Coast Ranges essentially divides the region into two climatic spheres. The land to the west of the ranges, closest to the coast tend to have more maritime climate that includes more cooling and rain influences from the Pacific ocean. Among the wine regions in this cooler area are the Mendocino Ridge, the Anderson Valley and the Yorkville Highlands AVAs. East of the ranges, the climate turns warmer and more Mediterranean around Ukiah and along the path of the Russian River as it makes its way southward to Sonoma County. Among the Mendocino wine regions in this warmer area are the Redwood Valley, Potter Valley, Cole Ranch, McDowell Valley, Covelo, Dos Rios AVAs as well as most of the large general area Mendocino AVA. In this eastern region, the ranges serve as a type of rain shadow and barrier to the cool Pacific fog which leaves the climate during the growing season much drier and warmer with ratings of Region III and IV on the Winkler scale. In the west, the Pacific fog plays a dominant role in the climate of the Anderson Valley. Following the path of the Navarro River from the Pacific, the fog drifts in and blankets the valley with low hanging cool air. Vineyards in these areas are often planted with cool-climate varieties like Pinot noir, Chardonnay, Gew√ºrztraminer and Riesling. At high elevations in Anderson Valley and nearby Mendocino Ridges beyond the fog's reach, these warmer pockets of lands will usually be planted with more warm climate varieties like Zinfandel. With the nearby Pacific bringing in a steady stream of moisture, rain during the harvest months can be an issue in this part of the county. Around Ukiah, in the center of the large Mendocino AVA to the east of the Mendocino Ranges, the climate can get very warm to hot during the growing season with mean July temperatures during the peak ripening month often in excess of 73 ¬∞F (23 ¬∞C). The average annual rainfall of 38 inches (964 mm) is mostly consolidated in the winter months, which means that drought is a common viticultural hazard that often requires supplemental irrigation. The warm allows this part of the county develop full bodied and very ripe red wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Petite Sirah and Zinfandel. The vineyard soils of the region are mostly deep alluvial soils. Near the Russian and Navarro Rivers, the soil becomes more gravelly- loam while the vineyards planted on the surrounding slope contain more thin scree. North of Ukiah and to the west, vines are often planted with an eastward orientation while further south in Mendocino Valley, vineyards are often planted with a westward orientation in order to prevent heat stress. In general the climate in Mendocino county promotes a shorter growing season of around 268 days compared to the 308 days that is an average growing season in neighboring Sonoma.T. Stevenson The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia pg 479‚Äì480 Dorling Kindersley 2005 Wine regions A Mendocino County Pinot noir. As of 2017, twelve American Viticultural Areas (AVA) have been designated within Mendocino County: Anderson Valley AVA, Cole Ranch AVA, Covelo AVA, Dos Rios AVA, Eagle Peak Mendocino County AVA, McDowell Valley AVA, Mendocino AVA, Mendocino Ridge AVA, Pine Mountain - Cloverdale Peak AVA, Potter Valley AVA, Redwood Valley AVA and Yorkville Highlands AVA. The majority of Mendocino County plantings are in the eastern side of the county, clustered around the cities of Ukiah, Hopland, and Redwood Valley. While Redwood Valley has its own AVA, most of these other plantings produce wine under the larger blanket of the Mendocino AVA. The most prominently featured AVAs to appear on wine labels are the Anderson Valley, Yorkville Highlands, and the broader Mendocino AVA. Anderson Valley and Mendocino Ridge The Anderson Valley is one of California's coolest wine growing regions in the state being deeply influenced by the cool Pacific fog coming in off the coast. Early plantings of Chardonnay, Gewurztraminer, and Pinot Noir in the 1960s and 1970s led to the formation of a handful of wineries by 1980. The potential for sparkling wine production became apparent in the 1980s when Champagne house Louis Roederer selected Anderson Valley for its California operation Roederer Estate. The Champagne firm scouted California extensively for years trying to find a region with the most climatic similarities to the Champagne region of France. Pinot Noir - grown for both sparkling and still wine production - is the dominant varietal for the region. A 2015 vineyard census determined that 87 of 91 vineyard properties in the region grow Pinot Noir. The Anderson Valley extends about 10 miles (16 km) from end to end and contains over 20 different types of alluvial soils. The area around the cities of Philo and Navarro, California in the center and north end of the valley receive considerably more cooling fog influence than the plantings closer to Boonville in the south. Despite being called a \\"valley\\", very few vineyards are planted on flat land. Much of the Anderson Valley is planted on a series of steep hills that range in elevation from 800‚Äì1300 feet (244‚Äì396 m). On the mountain ridges above the valley, the cooling influence of the fog can not quite reach the vineyards planted at these elevations. The direct exposure to the sun gives these isolated patches of vineyards more warmth which contributes to the spicy, berry notes of the Zinfandels produced in this part of the Anderson Valley. While some of these vineyards are still part of the Anderson Valley, many were siphoned off into the boundaries of the Mendocino Ridge AVA when it was established in 1997. As a series of disparate mountain ridges, the Mendocino Ridge was the first non-contiguous AVA established in California. Redwood, Potter and McDowell Valleys Grapes growing in the Redwood Valley The Redwood and Potter Valleys face each other on the west and east, respectively, just north of Lake Mendocino in the far eastern reaches of Mendocino County. The areas include heavily wooden terrain with the name Redwood Valley coming from the legends of redwood trees growing so densely packed that they blotted out the sky. In the southern reaches of Redwood Valley is the Ricetti bench, a fluvial terrace the features crimson red soil, where Mendocino County's first vineyards were planted in the 1850s. Today the Redwood Valley is known for its peppery, spicy Zinfandels. The Redwood Valley is slightly cooler than the vineyard plantings to the south towards Ukiah, allowing the area to produce wines with more acidity and deeper color. Many of the grapes grown in the Potter Valley AVA are blended and sold under the more widely recognizable Mendocino AVA. In the 21st century, Potter Valley has developed a reputation for white grape varieties such as Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc as well as Pinot noir from its pockets of cooler microclimates. In 2014, the area west of the Redwood and Potter Valley AVAs was designated the Eagle Peak Mendocino County AVA. The McDowell Valley is located at the southeastern end of Mendocino County on a sloping plateau east of Hopland. Most of the soil is unsuitable for viticulture, with the most favorable areas confined to croppings of gravelly-loam soils at elevations of around 1,000 feet (300 meters) that are surrounded by the nearby Mayacamas Mountains. The McDowell Valley is known for its Rhone-style wines and features 100+ year old vines of Grenache and Syrah. This includes some of the oldest Syrah plantings in California, dating back to 1913, which today makes the McDowell Valley an active center into research into the clonal varieties of Syrah. In addition to producing still red wines, the wineries of the McDowell Valley are also noted for their dry ros√©s. Grape varieties Chardonnay is Mendocino County's leading grape variety. The climatic and geographical diversity of Mendocino county, allows the region to produce a wide range of grape varieties for wine production. The region harvest, on average, around 62,000 tons of grapes- representing about 2% of California's yearly crush. Chardonnay is the county's leading planting (2015) with about 4,800 acres (1,950 ha) followed by Cabernet Sauvignon with 2,860 acres (1,150 ha) and Pinot noir with 2,695 acres (1090 ha). In addition Barbera, Cabernet Franc, Carignane, Charbono, Chenin blanc, Gew√ºrztraminer, Grenache, Malbec, Merlot, Muscat Canelli, Petit Verdot, Petite Sirah, Pinot blanc, Riesling, Roussanne, Sangiovese, Sauvignon blanc, Semillon, Syrah, Tocai Friulano, Viognier and Zinfandel are grown in Mendocino County.

It was one of seven Rosenwald schools built in the county. Construction of the school began in 1922 and was completed in 1923. The Julius Rosenwald Fund provided $500 toward the construction cost, the African-American community of Cairo raised $700 toward the project cost, and the Tennessee public school fund provided the remaining $700. The school was built according to a standard design for a one-teacher Rosenwald school. Built on a stone foundation, it has a gable-end entrance and weatherboard siding. Its interior contains one classroom, with two cloak closets on either side of the entrance door and a platform across the end of the building opposite the door. Modernization efforts after World War II included addition of electric wiring and indoor plumbing, resulting in one of the cloak closets being converted to a restroom. The school was operated until 1959, serving grades 1 through 8. After it closed due to school consolidation, it became a community center. In 1996, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places due to efforts by the Cairo Improvement Club. The building underwent a major restoration in 2008‚Äì2009 under the direction of the Tennessee Preservation Trust and the Middle Tennessee State University Center for Historic Preservation.

The narrow strip of prairie covered by the Foothills Erratics Train extends along the eastern flanks of the Rocky Mountains of Alberta and northern Montana to the International Border. The boulders of the Foothills Erratics Train consist of pink and purple Lower Cambrian shallow marine quartzite and conglomeratic quartzite, that are not native to this region of Alberta. These rocks only occur within the Gog Group that is exposed in the Tonquin Valley in the Rocky Mountains of central western Alberta. Their specific source has been identified as being near Mount Edith Cavell in Jasper National Park.

Edmonton, Alberta: Edmonton Geological Society. 34 pp. Geologic history Near the end of the Pleistocene, between 12,000 and 17,000 years ago, a massive landslide occurred within the Tonquin Valley in the Rocky Mountains of central western Alberta. This landslide deposited millions of tonnes of beige to pinkish quartzite and quartzitic conglomerate of the Gog Group onto the top of a valley glacier. This mass of quartzite and quartzitic conglomerate was carried eastward by this valley glacier. After leaving its valley within the Rocky Mountains, this valley glacier coalesced with other valley glaciers to form part of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. The former valley glacier as part of this ice sheet collided with the Laurentide Ice Sheet and it and the erratics of quartzite and quartzitic conglomerate were diverted southward along the boundary between these two ice sheets. Together they flowed parallel to the eastern flanks of the Rocky Mountains as far south as northern Montana before the ice sheet stagnated and melted. As the ice sheet melted, the erratics of Gog quartzite and quartzitic conglomerate were deposited as the narrow line of rocks known as the Foothills Erratics Train.Tharin, J.C. (1969). The Foothills Erratics Train of Alberta, Canada. Michigan Academician. 2(2):113-124. As they were transported down valley and later southward, the highly fractured boulders and other landslide debris were neither broken up into smaller blocks, rounded, nor marked with glacial striations because they were carried either on top or in the upper part of the glacier as it moved. In addition, the atypically linear string of glacial erratics that comprise the Foothills Erratics Train was created by the parallel, non-turbulent flowage of two very large ice masses‚Äîthe Cordilleran Ice Sheet to the west, and the Laurentide Ice Sheet to the east‚Äîthat occurred at the boundary between them. Had they been transported by either ice at the bottom of the glacier; by water; or by ice-rafting, the highly fractured boulders and other rocky debris would have been either quickly broken up into much smaller fragments, significantly rounded, widely dispersed over the landscape, or some combination of these.

These microspheres then embolize, lodging themselves in the liver's capillaries and bathing the malignancy in high levels of yttrium-90 radiation. It is currently approved as a Humanitarian Device, meaning effectiveness has not been proven, for patients as a neoadjuvant to surgery or transplantation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and is being used at a number of clinical centers in the United States. Description TheraSphere consists of insoluble glass microspheres where yttrium-90 is an integral constituent of the glass. Each milligram contains between 22,000 and 73,000 microspheres. Yttrium-90 is a pure beta emitter (physical half-life of 64.2 hours or 2.67 days) and decays to stable zirconium-90. The average energy of the beta emissions from yttrium-90 is 0.9367 MeV.

The microspheres are delivered into the liver tumor through a catheter placed into the hepatic artery that supplies blood to the tumor. This is usually performed in a hospital's radiology suite and patients remain conscious throughout the procedure. The microspheres are unable to pass through the vasculature of the liver due to arteriolar capillary blockade and are trapped in the tumor. There they exert a local radiotherapeutic effect with some damage to surrounding normal liver tissue.https://www.btg-im.com/en- US/TheraSphere/Products/About-TheraSphereTheraSphere - Innovative Form of Radiation Therapy for Inoperable Liver Cancer Therasphere was issued a Class 2 Device Recall from the FDA in October 2016.

Set in the fictional, rural American town of Greenvale, Washington, the story follows FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan as he investigates the murder of an eighteen-year-old woman, which bears similarities to a series of murders across the country. Deadly Premonition was originally released in February 2010 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3; the Xbox 360 version was published by Ignition Entertainment in North America, Marvelous Entertainment in Japan, and Rising Star Games in Europe. Marvelous Entertainment released the PlayStation 3 version exclusively in Japan. A director's cut edition for PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows was released worldwide by Rising Star Games in 2013. A port for the Nintendo Switch, Deadly Premonition: Origins, followed in 2019. Deadly Premonition is a reboot of Access Games' earlier video game Rainy Woods. In production from September 2004 to October 2007, Rainy Woods was cancelled soon after its debut at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show due to technical issues. Deadly Premonition combined its assets with a new game scenario and protagonist, Francis York Morgan. Gameplay is divided into York's detective investigation into Greenvale and its inhabitants, and supernatural combat sequences in which York must battle or evade otherworldly beings. Development on Deadly Premonitions setting was guided by an intention to imbue the game with a sense of realism: the non- player characters follow an individualized 24-hour schedule, and the scale of Greenvale is intended to replicate that of a rural American town. Issues with memory allocation, various lighting and shadow aspects, and the physics engine PhysX were faced during development. Deadly Premonition received wildly varying critical reviews and holds the Guinness World Record for the most critically polarizing survival horror game. Although the original release has not been commercially successful, Deadly Premonition has garnered a cult following and has been cited as an example of games as art. In September 2019, a sequel, Deadly Premonition 2: A Blessing in Disguise, was announced for the Nintendo Switch, which was released on July 10, 2020.  Gameplay  In this screenshot of the director's cut, York (center) stands in the rain near the police station, which is open. A map of the town relative to York's position is in the lower left, while his health and sleepiness/heartbeat bars are in the upper left; in the lower right is text noting what weapon is equipped. Deadly Premonition is a survival horror game set in an open world environment and played from an over-the shoulder third-person perspective. The game's objective is to guide the player character, FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan, as he investigates the identity of the Raincoat Killer, who is responsible for a murder in the rural town of Greenvale. York receives in-game money for numerous actions‚Äîboth for finishing levels and for minor events, such as shaving or changing suits; he can also be fined for poor performance, such as wearing dirty clothes. Additionally, he requires food and sleep at regular intervals, as indicated by the gauges measuring his hunger and need for sleep. If his gauge for sleepiness reaches zero, he will become hungry more quickly; if his gauge for hunger depletes, he will begin to lose health. Sleeping restores his health and tiredness, while food and items to ward off sleepiness, such as coffee, can be purchased from stores in Greenvale. York may explore Greenvale on foot, by car, or by using a special item obtained by completing a sidequest. Cars must be maintained, as they consume fuel, which York must purchase, and accumulate damage that eventually renders them useless unless York pays for their repair. York often has a specific time frame for investigating sites and interviewing non-player characters; however, if he misses the timeslot, the player may simply try again during the next day without a penalty. Places of business and entertainment venues in Greenvale have specific hours of operation and must be visited at the proper time to make use of their services. Non-player characters also have their own specific routines and travel around town as they go about their business. It also features a dynamic weather system and day-night cycle which affects the responses of the non-player characters. If York engages one at the right place and time of day, he or she may offer him a side-quest to perform for additional rewards. In addition to side-quests, trading cards are scattered throughout the town, which the player can collect while exploring. York can also participate in mini-games, such as darts, racing through checkpoints, and fishing, and may accelerate the passing of time by smoking cigarettes. Deadly Premonition contains several combat sequences, in which York encounters supernatural enemies while trapped in the Other World. York may battle them using melee weapons or firearms, or may choose to evade them by holding his breath. Melee weapons will eventually break with continued use, and York's pulse increases whenever he runs or holds his breath. Periodically, York encounters the Raincoat Killer, which will activate either a quick time event, a chase sequence, or a hiding event necessary to escape the murderer. During the Other World sequences, York's primary objective is to investigate crimes that took place there in the recent past. He collects photos of evidence to use to \\"profile\\" the scene and reconstruct events that took place with his deductive skills. Furthermore, the Other World regularly affects the entire town, excepting the interior of buildings, from midnight to six in the morning. Synopsis=Setting Deadly Premonition is set in a fictional universe, in which good and evil are spread by the messengers influenced by the Forest and Red Tree respectively. Contrasting pairs play a role in the game, such as \\"good and evil, reality and abnormality, earthly life and eternal life, day and night, criminals and victims, the forest and the red tree, and twins and dual personalities.\\" Throughout the game, the protagonist, Francis York Morgan (Jeff Kramer), periodically visits two supernatural rooms: the White Room and the Red Room. The White Room represents a normal subconscious, while the Red Room represents one influenced by evil. Plot Francis York Morgan investigates the murder of 18-year-old Anna Graham (Melissa Hutchison) in the rural town of Greenvale, Washington, in the United States. He takes on the case due to the manner of the killing: a ritualistic murder of a young woman where red seeds have been found on or near the body, similar to a series of other murders across the United States. York generates considerable friction with his dismissive attitude toward the locals, bizarre demeanor, and tendency to interrupt conversations to deliver asides to an unseen person referred to as \\"Zach.\\" He is assisted by the town's sheriff George Woodman (Casey Robertson), who is scarred by a past of childhood abuse; the deputy sheriff Emily Wyatt (Rebecca Wink), who becomes a love interest for York; and Thomas MacLaine (Christopher Sullivan), George's meek assistant. Additionally, York finds himself regularly ambushed and attacked by the Raincoat Killer, who, according to the folklore of the town, kills only when it rains. As the investigation continues, Anna's close friend Becky Ames (Amy Provenzano) and Diane (Christiane Crawford), Becky's elder sister and art gallery owner, are murdered in a similar fashion, with a mark placed nearby that York believes to be a peace symbol upside-down. He learns that the trees producing the red seeds grow in Greenvale and that there are two Raincoat Killers. The original one, who inspired the folklore, went on a killing spree after the United States military released gas made from the red seeds into the town in 1956, causing the residents to temporarily experience an uncontrollable, murderous rage. The second, the New Raincoat Killer, hopes to gain immortality by consuming the red seeds and murdering four people, who have also been forced to eat the seeds. When Thomas abruptly disappears, York suspects his involvement in the crimes, a hunch that is confirmed when Thomas kidnaps him. While tied up, York realizes his romantic feelings for Emily, who searches for him with Forrest Kaysen (Doug Boyd), a traveling tree salesman. It is also revealed that Anna, Becky, Thomas, and his younger sister Carol all belonged to a secret sex club created by George; jealous of George's romantic interest in Emily, Thomas draws her into a physical confrontation with him and dies when he falls on a hook. York, now rescued, reveals that he believes the copycat raincoat killer is George. Emily and York find the final victim, Carol; before dying, Carol attacks Emily out of jealousy as well and forces her to ingest some of the red seeds, which sickens her to the point of unconsciousness. York leaves Emily in Kaysen's care to confront George. George confesses to being the murderer and has gained shape-shifting powers as the result of eating the red seeds; in the ensuing fight, York kills him. Afterward, York realizes that, while George was the Greenvale killer, he could not have been responsible for the other similar murders nationwide and was likely just a pawn. He eventually discovers that Kaysen is responsible and that the symbol seen close to all the victims was a tree. York finds that Kaysen has planted a tree inside Emily's stomach, and the sight causes him to recover his repressed memories: as a child, Zach witnessed his mother (Rebecca Wink) dying with a tree sprouting from her body, with his father (David Rosenthal) and Kaysen in the room. His father was unable to kill her out of mercy, leading to a more agonising death for her, and then he killed himself. Unable to cope with the trauma, Zach psychologically switched places with his newly created other personality, York. Though unable to save Emily, Zach kills Kaysen, revealed to be a supernatural entity from the Red World and messenger of the Red Tree, and leaves the town with optimism for his future. In the closing scene, the spirits of York, Emily, Thomas, and the Greenvale murder victims are seen happily residing in a parallel plane of existence. Development Deadly Premonition originates from Rainy Woods, a game that Access Games began work on in fall 2004. A design document was produced in September 2004, followed by the project's start in March 2005. The prototype was assessed in October 2005, as was an alpha iteration in March 2006. In September 2007, a trailer for Rainy Woods debuted, promoting the title as a multi-platform game for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 consoles during the Tokyo Game Show; it featured the \\"young and very cynical\\" FBI Special Agent David Young Henning as its protagonist. Several video game journalists noted that the title shared strong similarities with the American supernatural television series Twin Peaks. Rainy Woods was cancelled soon after its debut, due to considerable \\"technological difficulties\\" with the two platforms' hardware, including memory allocation and lighting. In 2008, Suehiro began work on Deadly Premonition, which was intended to be a reboot of Rainy Woods, combining the assets from Rainy Woods with a new scenario and game design. In March 2009, the project started, although it would face cancellation four times. Access Games also began simultaneous development on Lord of Arcana, which would be released in October 2010. The budget for the overall project, according to Suehiro, was \\"[n]ot very much.\\" Suehiro created a new protagonist, Francis York Morgan, with help from his friends in the United States, and he and Kenji Gota, an independent film director, created York's dialogue with his split personality, Zach. As Gota and Suehiro are good friends and often have conversations about film, Suehiro tried to imbue the dialogue with that atmosphere. Additionally, they wrote the main plotline, while Suehiro wrote eighty percent of the sidequests and all of York's conversations with the nonplayer characters. The character Zach was intended to involve the player emotionally in the game by providing the sense that York was directly addressing and conversing with the player in his asides. A central focus of the gameplay is freedom for the player, as Suehiro had wanted to create a game that players could progress at their own speed. He had planned to incorporate two more mini-games involving chess and perfume, and had considered having the player character's weight and hair length fluctuate. Additionally, the combat sections of Deadly Premonition were added last in development, after a publisher worried that the game would not sell well in the West without it. Aspects of the game were initially more violent as well, as a way to express a fear of death; for example, the second victim was intended to be disemboweled while still living. However, the scenes were later toned down, as Suehiro felt that they were \\"too extreme\\". Suehiro's guiding concepts for the game's setting focused on \\"'real time,' 'real scale,' and 'real life.'\\" The developers traveled to the United States and noted the width measurements of the various billboards, railroad crossings, and roads to create a sense of realism for the town; the angles of the sun and weather patterns were also calculated. To add to that sense of realism, every street in Greenvale is named, and an hourly wage was decided on for a local diner. Additionally, the daily schedules of the non-player characters were created from their detailed background profiles. Areas of difficulties in the game's development were memory allocation, various lighting and shadow aspects, and their use of the physics engine PhysX. According to Wataru Nishide, the lead level artist, and J's Kataoka, the lead programmer, the team's data management had been \\"sloppy\\" due to their initial amazement at the amount of RAM that the next-generation consoles provided. The team found a balance between the practicalities of the available memory with the desired aesthetic of the outdoor sections of the game, which initially contained too many objects. The developers also had difficulties with balancing the game's lighting, desired aesthetics of the game's shadows and the processing rate. Furthermore, their use of PhysX proved to have mixed results; the developers enjoyed the \\"dynamic expression\\" that it gave the game's world, but had problems with the inability to \\"cheat\\" the \\"brutally honest\\" simulation and the resulting toll on the frame rate and processing. The team also had to cut back on the number of objects run in the PhysX engine, which initially included hair, clothing, and fishing rods among others, to preserve the frame rate. Audio Riyou Kinugasa, Takuya Kobayashi, and Hiromi Mizutani composed the soundtrack for Deadly Premonition. In his retrospective on Deadly Premonition, the lead planner Keiji Teranishi considered its soundtrack a strength, helping to add depth to the game's world and characters. He credited this partially to efforts in working with the composers to \\"appreciate the unique aesthetic\\" of the game's world. This included humming ideas for songs, using concept designs, and playing music with a similar feel. \\"Life is Beautiful\\", which uses whistling to evoke a calm walk in the countryside, was easily composed, along with \\"York and Zach\\", which appears during York's monologues. \\"Miss Stilletto Heels\\", the second theme of the game, and \\"Red Tree\\", a song meant to symbolize madness, proved more difficult to create, particularly its improvisation section. The sound effects were outsourced to another company, as Access Games lacked a department to deal with the sound. Voice recording took place at WebTone Studio in San Jose, California. Six thousand lines of dialogue were recorded over two weeks, about half of which were lines for York's voice actor, Jeff Kramer. Before recording, the voice actors were provided with character biographies and concept art. Teranishi recalled directing the voice recording as \\"quite a task,\\" and Suehiro sometimes acted out the lines himself to show what he wanted conveyed. Teranishi was particularly pleased with Kramer's performance as York, remarking that he \\"brought even greater depth and style to the lead role than Access Games had envisioned.\\" Release Deadly Premonition was published for the Xbox 360 by Ignition Entertainment in North America, priced within the budget range, on February 23, 2010; by Marvelous Entertainment in Japan on March 11, and by Rising Star Games in Europe on October 29. In Japan, the game was also simultaneously released for the PlayStation 3. Additionally, Rising Star decided to forgo an Australian release, as a result of what it cited as \\"classification concerns\\". In 2017, Deadly Premonition was made compatible with the Xbox One. In 2019, it was released as Deadly Premonition: Origins on the Nintendo Switch. Director's cut The director's cut of Deadly Premonition was developed by ToyBox Inc. In 2013, Rising Star published it for the PlayStation 3 in Europe and North America on April 30, and in Australia on May 16. The same year, Rising Star published it for Microsoft Windows on October 29, and its non-configurable resolution for the PC edition was fixed by a fan-made patch. On March 13, 2015, Deadly Premonition: Red Seeds Profile: Complete Edition, a Japanese version of the director's cut, was released for the PlayStation 3. In 2015, NIS America announced a limited collector's edition for the PlayStation 3 on November 24; it includes a hardcover artbook, soundtrack CD, a 54-card deck inspired by the game, and a voucher for the downloadable content. The director's cut has updated controls, stereoscopic 3D, updated HD visuals, PlayStation Move support, downloadable content including various pre-order bonuses, and additional scenarios written by Suehiro. It adds a frame story of an elderly Zach narrating the plot of Deadly Premonition to his granddaughter, Michelle Louise Morgan. The extended ending shows the elderly Zach entering the parallel plane of existence, where he is warmly greeted by the inhabitants. York reassures him that he was there every step of the way and tells him about a new case involving an outbreak of illness in New Orleans. After asking his opinion on the case, York tells him to wake up, and Louise can be heard off-screen informing her mother that he has disappeared and wondering where he could have gone to. Related media An interactive guide, Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut: The Official Visual Companion was released by Rising Star Games exclusively for iPad in October 2013. It includes three interactive maps, concept sketches, the soundtrack, Suehiro's notebook from the development of the game, and other interactive elements, such as puzzles.  Reception  In North America, Deadly Premonition led sales of Xbox 360 games on Amazon.com for the week of April 9, 2010, temporarily overtaking higher-profile releases such as Battlefield: Bad Company 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Mass Effect 2, and Left 4 Dead 2. 50,000 copies of Deadly Premonition were sold in North America during the first three months after its debut. According to an interview with Suehiro in February 2013, the original release of the game has not been commercially successful. The original version of Deadly Premonition for Xbox 360 received a weighted average score of 68/100 from aggregator Metacritic, indicating \\"mixed or average\\" reception. It is a critically polarizing game, with scores ranging from as low as 2 out of 10 from IGN US to as high as 10 out of 10 from Destructoid. In the 2012 Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition, Deadly Premonition holds the record as the \\"Most Critically Polarizing Survival Horror Game\\". (cf. Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition) The plot was positively received as eccentric and enjoyable. A reviewer for Edge wrote: \\"The beauty of Deadly Premonition is that it's a straightforward whodunnit viewed through the cracked prism of an unreliable narrator, conjuring an atmosphere of suspicion and confusion throughout.\\" Destructoids Jim Sterling appreciated the game's pop culture references, humor, and the dialogue, which he found to be hilarious and befuddling. The characters were positively received by reviewers as memorable and endearing. According to IGN UK, the interaction with characters and uncovering the details of their fictional lives helped to create a sense of emotional engagement with them that lasted after the game ended. York received a similar reception as \\"oddly endearing\\" despite his arrogance, and \\"one of the most interesting gaming protagonists for years.\\" The gameplay received a range of critical reaction, from competently done for a budget title to horribly executed. The gameplay of Deadly Premonition drew comparisons to that of Shenmue and the Clock Tower series while its combat was compared to that of Resident Evil 4. According to 1UP's Frank Cifaldi, Deadly Premonitions combination of similar gameplay to Shenmue, The Last Express, Resident Evil 4, and the Grand Theft Auto series, proved to be \\"a 'jack of all trades, master of none' scenario,\\" a sentiment that Erik Brudvig of IGN US agreed with. The controls also were criticized as detracting from the game's appeal. The combat sections received mixed reactions. IGN UK's Matt Wales wrote that while the combat was simple, the atmosphere and profiling worked nicely. According to Eurogamer's Chris Shilling, the sudden appearances of the Raincoat Killer made the sections frightening and the profiling made for some unsettling yet \\"relatively restrained\\" moments of horror, despite the \\"over-long and frequently clumsy\\" combat sequences. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot described the supernatural enemies as not particularly aggressive and boss battles as taking too long. Further criticism was directed at the game's music and visual quality. The graphics were frequently remarked upon as \\"terrible\\" and low quality. PALGN's Bev Chen, in contrast, felt that the quality of the graphics worked in the game's favor by adding a \\"bizarre charm.\\" Similarly, the game's soundtrack received criticism as sometimes thematically inappropriate, with serious scenes often containing a light-hearted jazz track; conversely, some critics found the soundtrack memorable and enjoyable, though repetitive in its selection. Nevertheless, the game has received a significant cult following. This cult success was attributed to how the game's \\"wildly mixed critical reception and headline-making strangeness got people talking\\" by Will Herring of GamePro. Citing the game as an example of \\"video games as art\\", David Jenkins of the Metro praised it for an \\"emotional range\\" encompassing survival horror and comedic farce. G4TV named it one of the \\"Top 10 Games of 2010... So Far\\" in June 2010. The game has received over a dozen other awards from various publications, including \\"Best Cult Game\\" from Gamasutra, \\"Most Surprisingly Good Game\\" from GameSpot, and \\"Best Worst Game\\" from GamesRadar. Critics have noted multiple allusions to Twin Peaks; among them are \\"its well dressed FBI agent, rural Pacific Northwest setting, and a healthy dose of woodsy supernatural mythos.\\" Reviewers have remarked on similarities in Deadly Premonitions characters with those of Twin Peaks. York has been commented on as sharing similarities with Twin Peaks protagonist Dale Cooper, notably a love of coffee and habitually addressing an unseen character; the first murder victim, Anna Graham, may be a homage to Laura Palmer, while her name may be a reference to both the character Annie and the actress who portrayed her, Heather Graham. The Pot Lady, a side character who carries around a pot, may be a reference to the Log Lady, although they serve different narrative functions. The Red Room of Deadly Premonition has some similarities with the Red Room of Twin Peaks, in that both are supernatural locations that the protagonist can access. The A & G Diner might be a reference to the RR Diner of Twin Peaks, both of which are based on Twede's Cafe in North Bend, Washington. The Great Deer Yard Hotel may be inspired by Twin Peakss the Great Northern Hotel, which was based on the Salish Lodge in Snoqualmie Falls, Washington. The character Emily has also been noted to visually resemble actress Naomi Watts, who starred in a film directed by David Lynch, Mulholland Drive, and later appeared in Twin Peaks: The Return. The director's cut for the PlayStation 3 received a weighted average of 70/100 from Metacritic, also indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Eurogamer's Oli Welsh wrote that the director's cut corrects some of the original \\"flaws,\\" but others are left untouched, \\"just as you'd want it, really.\\" Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot remarked that, while the director's cut had not been \\"a dramatic overhaul,\\" the game remained enjoyable and entertaining. Conversely, the Official PlayStation Magazines concluded that the retail price was too high to justify recommending the director's cut with all its flaws. Critics praised the new controls as an improvement. The graphics received more mixed reviews: Sterling wrote that \\"this new version at least looks better on modern televisions -- though your mileage may vary,\\" while other reviewers concluded that, even with improvements, the graphics still either barely met or fell beneath standards for a later PlayStation 2 game. The inclusion of the minor narrative additions were generally enjoyed, although not viewed by critics as adding anything substantial to the plot. Issues with the frame rate and an \\"echo\\" effect with the voice acting were also noted in the port. Sequel A sequel called Deadly Premonition 2: A Blessing in Disguise was announced in September 2019 for the Nintendo Switch. It was released on July 10, 2020. Set in 2019 in Boston, the plot will focus on Aaliyah Davis, an FBI agent who reopens an old investigation; her story will intertwine with that of Francis York Morgan, fourteen years prior in the city of Le Carr√©, which is based on New Orleans.

History of Koshint≈ç research There are no records of \\"pure\\" Koshint≈ç in early Japanese literature. By the time Japan was producing literature, its native religion had already intermixed with Taoism and Buddhism.

Mori Point itself is a bluff next to the Pacific Ocean that provides scenic views of the peninsula coastline. In addition to the bluff and ridge, Mori Point contains a few small ponds and wetlands. Trails, many newly built, connect the ridgeline to the entrances to the park and to Sharp Park beach. A portion of the California Coastal Trail will run through Mori Point. The ponds and wetlands of Mori Point serve as habitat for the threatened California red-legged frog and the endangered San Francisco garter snake. Mori Point also has northern coastal scrub and California coastal prairie habitat in upland areas, and is well known for its spring wildflower displays. The park is bounded by Laguna Salada Marsh and Sharp Park Municipal Golf Course to the north; by Highway 1 and Sweeney Ridge to the east; and by the Calera Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant to the south. History An archaeological survey in 1969 revealed a shell midden at Mori Point, demonstrating pre-Columbian Native American residency at Mori Point. The limestone at Mori Point has been quarried by Native Americans and, later, by the Spanish.Postel (2010), p. 200 Francisco Sanchez received Rancho San Pedro in 1839 during the Rancho period, which encompassed much of present-day Pacifica, including the land that would later be called Mori Point. The land now occupied by Mori Point was purchased by Stefano Mori and his family in 1888, who operated a farm and ranch at the point.Postel (2010), p. 201 The kitchen, built to feed employees, eventually became the Mori Point Inn, which remained in operation until 1965. The exact date of establishment is in question, but newspaper reports from 1910 cite Steve Mori as manager of the Inn in 1910.Postel (2010), p. 228 During Prohibition, the Inn was a well- known speakeasy.Postel (2010), p. 227 Fishing village on the Pacific coast. Photographed by Dorothea Lange for the Farm Security Administration (1938). Rocks from the limestone quarry were used as track ballast for the Ocean Shore Railroad and to rebuild San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake. Highway 1, which divides Mori Point from Sweeney Ridge, occupies a cut first intended to accommodate the Ocean Shore Railroad.Postel (2010), p. 209 A 1938 photograph by Dorothea Lange shows a fishing village and the quarry in the background. During the 1920s, bootleggers used the site to bring alcohol into the Bay Area. Federal agents confiscated 24,000 cases of whiskey worth in 1923 from Jack Mori's farm, but Ray (or Rey) Mori was the only family member ever arrested for alcohol-related offenses during Prohibition. Ray was arrested in 1929 for serving alcoholic drinksPostel (2010), p. 223 at the Francisco Sanchez Adobe, which was operated as a restaurant on the surface and clandestinely as a speakeasy and bordello. He received four months of probation and a $225 fine.Postel (2010), p. 229 Ray and his wife Marie took over the operation of the inn by 1932, reportedly because Jack was being pressured by federal agents. The Inn closed in 1965 and it burned down on February 26, 1966, just three months after going out of business.Postel (2010), p. 231 After the Inn closed in 1965, the hillsides were used for motorcycle racing and sand quarrying, creating scars on the hillsides that are still visible. A development was proposed in 1984 and approved in 1988 by the City Council of Pacifica. The development would have encompassed 60 single- family homes, a horse show arena, and a 275-room hotel and conference center. The group \\"Pacificans for Mori Point\\" filed suit to block the development, charging the environmental impact report was incomplete. The National Park Service published the Pacifica Boundary Study in 1998, which identified several parcels of land in Pacifica it would like to add to the GGNRA. The total proposed addition of land was fifteen parcels totaling , including the Mori Point parcel, and if completed, would result in nearly one-third of the entire land area of the City of Pacifica being controlled by the National Park Service. In 2000, Mori Point was put up for sale at auction, and the Pacifica Land Trust, the California Coastal Conservancy and the Trust for Public Land launched a campaign to purchase the property for preservation with a successful bid of . The property was purchased at public auction and donated to the Federal Government in 2002, when it was added to GGNRA. By 2005, two ponds were dug on the north side of the Mori Point plot to restore habitat for the red-legged frog and Pacific tree frogs, hoping to establish frog colonies and attract their predators, the San Francisco garter snake. Frog eggs were spotted by the spring of 2005 and the snakes were seen foraging next to the ponds in 2007. In the Fall of 2007, the Mori Point Project, made up of staff from the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, and volunteers, completed the removal of soil contaminated with diesel fuel, the creation of a new pond and wetlands area and a new path with access steps nicknamed \\"Bootlegger's Steps\\" up to the top of Mori Point bluff. Dead sperm whale on beach below Mori Point (April 2015). In April 2015, a long sperm whale washed up on the beach below Mori Point. Although the whale was emaciated, a necropsy ruled out common causes of death such as disease, age, shark attack, or being struck by a ship. A second whale, a long female humpback whale washed up just north of the sperm whale three weeks later on Sharp Park Beach. The second whale had injuries consistent with a ship strike and due to the odor, both whales were buried later in May. In popular culture Mori Point is featured in the climactic scene from the 1971 movie Harold and Maude.

Decoy cells owe their name to their strong resemblance to cancer cells, and may as such confuse the diagnosis of either viral infection or urothelial malignancy. Epidemiology and presentation Decoy cells are mostly prevalent in immunocompromised individuals, such as transplant recipients who are treated with immunosuppressive medication in order for their immune system not to reject the foreign transplanted organ. Several viruses mediated the emergence of decoy cells, amongst which cytomegalovirus and polyomavirus. Decoy cells are virus infected urothelial cells with a distinct morphology of enlarged nuclei and intranuclear inclusions. In renal transplant recipients, such cells may be found in up to 40 percent of cases. Decoy cells are clinically relevant since they may be used as a prognostic marker for clinical conditions such as polyomavirus BK-induced nephropathy in renal transplant recipients, and haemorrhagic cystitis in haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Diagnosis Decoy cells can be seen in a urine sample through Papanicolaou staining or phase-contrast microscopy. By Papanicolaou stain, most decoy cells have an enlarged nucleus that bears a basophilic inclusion which is surrounded by chromatin that confers a ground-glass or gelatinous appearance. Sometimes the nuclear inclusion has a vesicular aspect, the chromatin may be clumped, and it may be surrounded by a halo. When decoy cells derive from the urothelium, the heavily enlarged and altered nuclei as well as the irregular shape of the cell body can mimic the changes observed in neoplastic cells. By phase-contrast microscopy, decoy cells show the same abnormalities described for stained specimens, namely, enlargement of the nucleus with a ground-glass or vesicular appearance, altered chromatin, enlarged nucleoli, the presence of a halo, and at times also cytoplasmic vacuoles. In our experience, these features make decoy cells different from tubular cells and transitional cells found in all other conditions. The only exception is represented by cells infected by cytomegalovirus, which frequently show a ‚Äòbird's eye‚Äô appearance. from As such, decoy cells may strongly resemble malign cancer cells, from which they also derive their name. This is because they can be mistaken for cancer cells, or the other way around where cancer cells can be mistaken for decoy cells. Signs and symptoms Decoy cells themselves do not cause any disease, and they may be found in the urine of healthy individuals. In immunodeficient individuals, such as transplant recipients or severely immuncompromised HIV-infected individuals, viruses in general more often reactivate owing to a lack of immunologic surveillance. As such, in these individuals, decoy cells are also seen more frequently. The viruses that induce the emergence of decoy cells, may causes disease, but again mainly in immunocompromised individuals. Cytomegalovirus may be the cause of retinitis, respiratory symptoms and or enteritis. Polyomaviruses may cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (JC virus) and polyomavirus-associated nephropathy, ureteral stenosis and hemorrhagic cystitis (BK virus). The latter condition mainly occurs in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Several publications have tried to use decoy cells as a prognostic marker for polyomavirus-associated diseases such as polyomavirus BK-associated nephropathy (BKVAN), a condition occurring only in immunocompromised individuals and especially in renal transplant recipients. BKVAN is a condition wherein overt replication of polyomavirus BK causes an interstitial inflammation in a kidney. Treatment Decoy cells alone do not need to be treated since they do not necessarily indicate pathology. However, in the context of overt viral replication against the background of immunodeficiency, the viruses that cause the emergence of decoy cells must be treated. For polyomavirus BK, only the restoration of immunologic function and the subsequent reconstitution of cells with antiviral activity such as natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells has proven to be effective. Restoration of the immune system can be achieved via different paths according to the different patient groups. For example, in severely immunocompromised HIV- patients, previously called AIDS-patients, immunologic function can be restored by treatment with highly active anti-retroviral therapy. In kidney transplant recipients who are treated with immunosuppressive agents, immunologic function can be treated by tapering of the immunosuppressive regimen. Other agents that have been proposed to target polyomavirus BK, such as cidofovir, fluoroquinolones, leflunomide, and statins are far from established and the published results on their effectivity are conflicting. Also, some of these agents may cause severe long-lasting side effects.

County names in the United States automatically qualify as legal appellations of origin for wine produced from grapes grown in that county and do not require registration with the United States Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. Sonoma County is one of California's largest producers of wine grapes, far outproducing the Napa Valley AVA.  History  Grapes growing along State Route 12. Grapes were planted in Sonoma County at Fort Ross as early as 1812. Padre Jose Altimira planted several thousand grape vines at Mission San Francisco Solano in what is now the city of Sonoma, in southern Sonoma County. Cuttings from the Sonoma mission vineyards were carried throughout the northern California area to start new vineyards. By the time of the Bear Flag Revolt in Sonoma and the subsequent annexation of California by the United States in 1854, wine grapes were an established part of agriculture in the region. The vineyards of General Mariano Vallejo, military Governor of Mexican California and based in Sonoma, were producing an annual income of $20,000 at that time.Sonoma County Winegrape Commission The grape varietals planted would not be considered premium varietals today. In 1855, a Hungarian named Agoston Haraszthy arrived in Sonoma Valley. Upon his arrival, he purchased the Salvador Vallejo vineyard, which he then renamed it Buena Vista. Commissioned in 1861 by the California legislature to study viticulture in Europe, he returned with more than 100,000 cuttings of premium grape varietals. Many of the immigrants to the area were Northern Italian or from other wine-growing regions of Europe. After the Civil War and before Prohibition, wineries such as Bundschu, Foppiano, Korbel, Simi, Gundlach, Quitzow and Sebastiani were established that still exist. In the 1920s there were 256 wineries in Sonoma County, with more than in production. During the Prohibition period, however, commercial winemaking declined. At the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, fewer than 50 wineries in Sonoma County survived. Even as late as the 1960s, only were vineyards. But wine consumption in America began to grow, and by 1999 Sonoma County had over of vineyards owned by more than 750 growers and 180 bonded wineries.Sonoma County Vintners: Winemaking Timeline. Retrieved 10 July 2007. Of the 250 wineries existing in 2007, over half are less than 20 years old. During the 2019 Kincade Fire, some wineries and vineyards experienced a week of intense heat, smoke and evacuation-caused neglect of newly fermenting wine.  Winemaking  A Chardonnay from Sonoma County. In 2004, growers harvested 165,783 tons (150,396 tonnes) of wine grapes worth US$310 million. In 2006 the Sonoma County grape harvest amounted to 216,000 tons, worth $430 million.Sonoma County Vintners association: Year 2006 Sonoma County grape harvest statistics. Retrieved 10 July 2007 About 73% of Sonoma County's agricultural production is growing wine grapes-- of vineyards, with over 1100 growers. The most common varieties planted are Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Pinot noir, though the area is also known for its Merlot and Zinfandel.  Appellations  Sonoma County, California Sonoma County's large number (18) of American Viticulture Areas (AVAs) reflect the wide variety of climate and soil conditions in the County, the large production in the County, and the prominence of Sonoma County in the wine market. The difference in climate and soil (terroir), means that cooler climate grapes grow well in certain regions and in others warm climate grapes are more suitable. The large production of the County means that each AVA is significant in its own right. The prominence of the California wine industry and Sonoma County in particular has established worldwide recognition of their wine regions. At the same time, many consumers have been confused by the many different AVAs within Sonoma County. The growers voted in 2006 to form a Sonoma County Winegrape Commission, representing more than 1,800 growers. The Commission seeks to raise recognition for Sonoma County and encourages all wine from the county to bear the mark \\"Sonoma County\\" on it. The following are appellations in Sonoma County:  Alexander Valley  A Cabernet Sauvignon from Alexander Valley. The Alexander Valley AVA is one of the most densely planted of all of Sonoma County's AVAs. Located along the Russian River, the boundary of this appellation extends north of Healdsburg up to Mendocino County north of Cloverdale. Viticulture has existed in the area since the 1850s but the wine industry has only fairly recently experienced success beginning in the 1960s with Simi Winery. Significant purchases of vineyard land by E & J Gallo Winery in 1988 and Kendall-Jackson in 1996 also raised the profile of the Alexander Valley. The profile of Alexander Valley wines has historically centered around the approachability and richness of the wines with Cabernet Sauvignon being noted for characteristic chocolate notes and warm mouthfeel. After Cabernet, Chardonnay is one of the leading varietal plantings followed by Sauvignon blanc and Zinfandel.  Bennett Valley  The Bennett Valley AVA is one of Sonoma County's newest AVAs and is a principal grape supplier to Kendall- Jackson. The AVA is surrounded to the south, east and west by the Sonoma Mountains and to the north by the city of Santa Rosa. The region receives a moderating effect on its climate from Pacific Ocean through the cool coastal fogs and breeze that creep into the area from the southwest through Crane Canyon between Sonoma Mountain and Taylor Mountain.  Chalk Hill  The Chalk Hill AVA is a sub-appellation of the Russian River Valley located near the town of Windsor along the foothills at the southern end of Alexander Valley and along the Santa Rosa plain. The name Chalk Hill comes from the unique volcanic soil of chalky white ash which has shown itself to perform well with planting of white wine varietals like Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc. The majority of the region's wineries are located on the western slopes of the Mayacamas Mountains.  Dry Creek Valley  The view from Teldeschi Winery in the Dry Creek Valley AVA The Dry Creek Valley AVA in the Russian River Valley centers around the Dry Creek, a tributary of the Russian River, and is approximately long and wide. The appellation is known particularly for its Sauvignon blanc and Zinfandel production. Dry Creek Valley AVA is home to the majority of the Sonoma Gallo vineyards, who established winery facilities in the valley in the early 1990s.  Fort Ross-Seaview  The 27,500-acre Fort Ross-Seaview AVA is located in the western part of Sonoma County and contains 18 commercial vineyards on 506 acres. It lies entirely within the Sonoma Coast AVA and does not overlap other AVAs. Vineyards within this area are generally located on rounded ridges with summits extending above 1,200 feet consisting of steep, mountainous terrain made up of canyons, narrow valleys, ridges, and 800- to 1,800-foot peaks. Areas above 900 feet in elevation, the climate is influenced by longer periods of sunlight and is warmer than that in the surrounding land below.  Fountaingrove District  Established in 2015, the Fountaingrove District AVA encompasses 38,000 acres in the eastern boundaries of Sonoma County. It is home to over 600 acres of hillside vineyards with elevations reaching up to 2,000 feet. The region is best known for its Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah varietals.  Green Valley of Russian River Valley  The Green Valley of Russian River Valley AVA was formerly known as the Sonoma County Green Valley AVA. Located at the southwestern corner of the Russian River Valley AVA, its close proximity to the Pacific Ocean makes it one of the coolest appellations within Sonoma County. The climate in the Green Valley is even cooler than other parts of the Russian River Valley, and favors the cultivation of cool climate grape varietals. Seeking to connect the region with the more commercially successful Russian River Valley name, the appellation formally changed its name on April 23, 2007.  Knights Valley  The Knights Valley AVA occupies the boundaries between the southern end of the Alexander Valley AVA and the northern end of Napa Valley. Some of the earliest vineyards in the area was owned by Beringer Vineyards. The area is known for its Cabernet Sauvignon.  Los Carneros  The Los Carneros AVA spans the last, low hills of the Mayacamas Mountains dividing both Napa and Sonoma Valleys just north of San Pablo Bay. The larger portion of the AVA stretches into Sonoma County with grapes grown here also being allowed to use the Sonoma Valley AVA designation. The area's close proximity to the Bay has made it an ideal location for Pinot noir and Chardonnay production with producers from international Champagne houses such as Mo√´t et Chandon (Domaine Chandon California), Taittinger (Domaine Carneros), and Cava producers planting vineyards or sourcing grapes from the area.  Moon Mountain District Sonoma County  The Moon Mountain District Sonoma County AVA, officially approved by the TTB in 2013, is a sub- appellation of the Sonoma Valley AVA. Moon Mountain AVA shares its eastern border with Mt. Veeder AVA, a sub-appellation of Napa Valley.  Northern Sonoma  The Northern Sonoma AVA is an all encompassing appellation that covers all of Sonoma County with the exception of the Sonoma Valley and some areas of the Petaluma River watershed. The AVA was proposed by E & J Gallo to accommodate wines made from a blend of grapes from scattered vineyards in Sonoma County.  Petaluma Gap  The Petaluma Gap AVA is the newest wine region of Sonoma County (approved in December 2017) and takes its name from the geographic feature which allows cool ocean air currents to flow into the valley. These winds, combined with the influence of San Pablo Bay, make the region ideal for Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Syrah.  Pine Mountain- Cloverdale Peak The Pine_Mountain-Cloverdale Peak AVA is one of the highest elevation grape-growing regions in California. The AVA, which rises from 1,600 feet at its lowest point to 3,000 feet at the mountain‚Äôs peak, has grapes growing primarily at 1,800 feet and higher. The very high elevation of the mountain affects fog cover, hours of daylight, daytime and nighttime temperatures, rainfall, and wind ‚Äî virtually every climatic element influencing wine grape production.  Rockpile  The Rockpile AVA is situated at the northwest point of the Dry Creek Valley AVA, past Healdsburg. The area was first planted by Italian immigrants at the turn of the 20th century. Many of today's vineyards were formerly occupied by a reservoir created by the Warm Springs Dam on the Russian River. The area is known for its fruity, ripe Zinfandels.  Russian River Valley  An unoaked Chardonnay from the Russian River Valley. A vineyard in the Russian River Valley AVA The Russian River Valley AVA lies adjacent to and west of the city of Santa Rosa and incorporates the southern reach of the Russian River, where the river bends westward and cuts through the Coast Range to the Pacific Ocean. The AVA is characterized by the regular intrusion of cooling fog from the coast. The fog flows through the Petaluma Wind Gap and the channel cut by the river. The fog generally arrives in the evening or early morning and retreats before noon in the day. The appellation was granted AVA status in 1983 and accounts for about one-sixth of the total planted vineyard acreage in Sonoma County. In 2005 the AVA was expanded by to 126,600 by recognizing previously overlooked portions of the fog regions. Presently the Russian River AVA includes more than planted to wine grapes. At last count, 79 wineries were listed in the Russian River Valley Winegrowers website. The area is known for its success with cool climate varietals, notably Pinot noir and Chardonnay.  Sonoma Coast  The Sonoma Coast AVA contains more than , mostly along the coastline of the Pacific Ocean. It extends from San Pablo Bay to the border with Mendocino County. The appellation is known for its cool climate and high rainfall relative to other parts of Sonoma County. Pinot noir grapes grow especially well in this region, where they benefit from slightly cooler day temperatures.  Sonoma Valley  Outdoor wine tasting area at St. Francis Winery & Vineyards The Sonoma Valley AVA is known for its unique terroir with Sonoma Mountain protecting the area from the wet and cool influence of the nearby Pacific Ocean. The Sonoma Mountains to the west help protect the valley from excessive rainfall. The cool air that does affect the region comes northward from San Pablo Bay through the Carneros region and southward from the Santa Rosa plain. Sonoma Valley has played a significant role in the history of California wine.  Sonoma Mountain  The Sonoma Mountain AVA, in the Sonoma Mountains, includes the town of Glen Ellen and is bordered on the west by the Sonoma Valley AVA. The area is known for the diverse micro-climates that occur within the crevices and folds of the hillside terrain and as such is home to production for a wide range of varietals including Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Sauvignon blanc, Semillon, and Zinfandel.

Athletic career Hayward was born in Detroit, Michigan. His parents were Canadians and he grew up in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. An all-around athlete likened to Jim Thorpe, Hayward excelled at ice hockey, rowing, wrestling, boxing, and played lacrosse on one of the Ottawa Capitals' world championship teams of the 1890s. Hayward was also renowned as one of Canada's fastest sprinters, running distances from 75 to 600 yards. His last name was originally spelled Heyward; he changed it later in life, when he headed west. Early coaching career Hayward's first coaching job was as an assistant track coach, first at Princeton University in New Jersey in 1898, and then out west at the University of California in Berkeley. In 1901, he moved north to Oregon, becoming the head track coach at Pacific University in Forest Grove, where he trained future Olympic gold medalist A. C. Gilbert and coached the Boxers to the state collegiate track championship. In 1903, Hayward took the head job at Albany College (now Lewis & Clark College in Portland), where his track team defeated the University of Oregon. Oregon promptly hired him as their first permanent track coach the next year. Oregon and Olympic career As head coach of the UO track and field team, Hayward (who was known as \\"Colonel Bill\\" due to his gruff demeanor) built it into one of regional dominance and national prominence over his 44 years as coach. In all, he coached four track world record holders, six American record holders, and nine Olympians. Notable Oregon athletes trained by Hayward include: * sprinter Daniel Kelly set records in the 100-yard dash at 9.6 seconds in 1906 and the 220 yard run (21.1 sec.), won silver medal in the long jump at the 1908 Olympics * hurdler Martin Hawkins won a bronze medal in the 110 meter hurdles at the 1912 Olympics * pole vaulter Ralph Spearow set the world record in 1924 * long distance runner Ralph Hill won a silver medal in the 5000 meters at the 1932 Olympics * discus thrower Ed Moeller set the world record in 1929 * javelin thrower Bob Parke, 1934 NCAA champion * sprinter Mack Robinson, 1938 NCAA champion in the 220 yard dash, won a silver medal in the 200 meters at the 1936 Olympics * pole vaulter George Varoff set the world record in 1936 * high jumper Les Steers set three world records and was 1941 NCAA champion. * Bill Bowerman succeeded Hayward as coach and co- founded Nike, Inc. with Phil Knight. In addition to his track coaching duties, Hayward served as the athletic trainer for Oregon's football team, where he was known for inventing knee braces and other equipment for the players. He also coached UO's basketball team from 1903 to 1913 and again in 1917‚Äì1918, compiling an overall record o In 1912, Hayward was a coach for the United States team at the Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden, the first of a string of six Olympics in which he coached, through 1936. Hayward Field Prior to 1921, Hayward's athletes trained at Kincaid Field, which was also the site of Oregon's football field. The field was upgraded several times to accommodate the needs of the growing track and field program, but by 1912, plans for a new facility were made. In 1919, a new football field was built and named Hayward Field in his honor; it was dedicated during halftime of its first football game, but Hayward was busy working as the trainer during the break and was not aware of the honor until the next day. It was two more years before track and field facilities were installed at the new venue. The opening of Autzen Stadium for football in 1967 gave the track and field team exclusive use of Hayward Field, except for a few freshman football games. Death and legacy Hayward's grave marker at Rest-Haven Cemetery Hayward retired from coaching at age 79 in the fall of 1947. He was hospitalized a few months later after being stricken with a heart ailment, and died at Sacred Heart Hospital on December 14, 1947. Hayward was buried at Rest-Haven Cemetery in Eugene. John Warren succeeded Hayward for the 1947‚Äì48 school year, giving way to Bill Bowerman, who became Oregon's head track coach in 1948. Hayward was an inaugural inductee to both the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1980 and the University of Oregon Athletic Hall of Fame in 1992. In 2005, he was inducted into the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association Hall of Fame.

Description Hiking trail access to Sweeney Ridge is available, on the Pacifica side, from the Shelldance Nursery site (Mori Ridge trail), and from the east end of Fassler Avenue (Baquiano Trail). On the San Bruno side, access the area from parking lots #2 and #4 at Skyline College (Sweeney Ridge Trail), and via a paved trail from the end of Sneath Lane in San Bruno (bikes OK). Ecologically, Sweeney Ridge is an example of Northern coastal scrub habitat, the landscape dominated by Coyote Bush, Yellow Bush Lupine, and California Yerba Santa‚Äîin some places up to 6 to 8 feet high. Access from Sneath Lane provides a 2-mile walk up a fenced hardtop road through this shrubby habitat. The ridgetop itself has quite a bit of California coastal prairie, mostly native grasses with patches of Douglas iris. The ridgetop is also considered one of the best Bay Area lookouts for spring northbound raptor migration, based on studies by the Golden Gate Raptor Observatory. The ridge trail leads to a series of abandoned buildings that were formerly the site of the SF-51C Nike missile control facility.

It is the last bridge over the Neris River before its mouth. Its length exceeds 291 metres, width 14 metres. The bridge was completed during the interbellum period in 1929. The Vilijampolƒó Bridge across the Neris River received special attention from the Lithuanian rebels during the June Uprising in Lithuania in 1941 as they expected the Germans to enter the city using this bridge. When the Lithuanians got to the bridge, it was already wired by Red Army with explosives. 40 Soviet troops and three armoured vehicles protected the bridge and waited for the right moment to detonate. When the Soviets retreated a bit after facing Lithuanian fire, Juozas Savulionis ran to the middle of the bridge, cut the wires, and thus saved it from destruction. On his way back Savulionis was shot and killed by Soviet fire, becoming one of the first victims of the uprising. It was destroyed in 1944 by Wehrmacht as the Soviet forces were approaching. It was rebuilt in 1948 and renovated in 2008. It was named after Petras Vilei≈°is, an engineer from Interbellum Lithuania.

Cronin about the loves of Lucy Moore ‚Äì her husband, her son, and God. Initially published by Gollancz, the story demonstrates how a virtue can become a vice when misguided in seeking rewards other than those in and of itself. The self-satisfied Lucy loves her husband, yet she yearns to improve him so that she can love him even more. To teach him hospitality she invites Cousin Anna, against his protest, to their home. Anna's free and easy behavior soon makes Lucy forget hospitality, and she thinks only of her husband's possible infidelity, which eventually alienates him. When her husband is driven from the house, Anna goes with him, but he is drowned in the ensuing pursuit. Lucy then turns to her son, Peter, and works extremely hard so that he may become a doctor. She accepts no help and refuses to even marry in order to preserve the purity of her motives. Her motherly love is not so pure as she thinks; when Peter marries, her life is ruined once again. Disappointed in men, Lucy gives all her love to God. As an aged novice in a Belgian monastery, she forces herself to endure disciplinary mortifications for her new love's sake. However, her wearied body cannot stand the strain, and growing sick, she is sent back to England. When her son, through no fault of his own, fails to meet her train, she waits for him on the station platform until she falls. After a brief agony in a hospital, Lucy dies. Category:Novels by A. J.

The film stars Miriam Yeung as Bingo Leung, a working-class woman who discovers she has breast cancer. The film is based on Xi Xi's published diary Mourning For Breasts (ÂìÄÊÇº‰π≥Êàø), which chronicled her own experiences. Synopsis Bingo Leung, an advertising executive, lives a carefree life with her friends until she bumps into a doctor, V, who becomes infatuated with her after she rejects him. His interference leads to her discovery of a malignant lump on her breast and a medical scam targeting her orchestrated by her long-lost boyfriend. Everything begins to fall apart as she tries to cope with the loss of femininity in a series of bittersweet events. With the help of V and a shy but talented teenage singer Sing, Bingo is able to cope with her cancer, revive her career and strengthen her bonds with her family. The epilogue shows Bingo years later at a shop buying a bra for her daughter.

After Milkyway Image gained film rights, a first draft of the script was written by Ivy Ho, who relied on the diary's structured writings. After producers felt that the diary did not have a complete story, they hired screenwriter Fung Chi-Keung to rewrite the story. Marketing The controversial teaser poster for 2 Become 1 was banned from Hong Kong's subway system. 2 Become 1 first gained controversy with the film's original theatrical poster, which showed a computer-altered photograph of a woman's upper torso. MTR, which runs Hong Kong's subway system, concluded that the poster was not suitable for the public and banned it from all subway stations, which were traditionally the most important locations for displaying movie posters in the city. The posters were replaced with a more traditional design, showing portraits of the leading actors. Miriam Yeung reacted strongly to the ban, and noted that there was no nudity in the film.Xinhua ‚Äì English Reaction to the teaser poster differed in Mainland China. The Chinese Film Bureau, which is in charge of movie censorship, praised the design for its social value. The film's Mainland Chinese distributor, Polybona Films used the breasts design in various promotional materials.

He was highly active in the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society (LASFS) and a major SMOF, co-chairing the 30th World Science Fiction Convention. He also wrote filksongs and was a master costumer.  Early life  Pelz spent most of his childhood in New York State. He earned the rank of Eagle Scout. He went to college in Florida, where he developed an interest in spelunking (initially as an attempt to conquer claustrophobia) and encountered science fiction fandom for the first time. In 1959 he moved to Los Angeles to study library science at the University of Southern California, and joined LASFS. shows Pelz officially became a member on January 7, 1960.  Fan career  Pelz served at least two terms as LASFS President (\\"Director\\", or later \\"Procedural Director\\") and was Treasurer for nearly a decade, shepherding the club to ownership of its own building, an idea originally proposed by Paul Turner. Even after he retired from that position, he remained active on the corporate Board of Directors, serving as Chairman and later as corporate treasurer (\\"Comptroller\\"). He was a respected elder statesman of the club until his death in 2002. Pelz came into fandom before the hobby had speciated, when fans commonly participated in many areas of the hobby. Pelz published general interest fanzines (\\"genzines\\") and newszines, assisting Ron Ellik with Starspinkle (1962‚Äì1964), then starting his own Ratatosk (1964‚Äì1968). Pelz also became an omniapan, joining all fannish amateur press associations (\\"APAs\\"; hence \\"apans\\"; hence \\"omniapans\\") then in existence -- FAPA, SAPS, OMPA, and The Cult, and later two local APAs: APA-F (published weekly at the alternating meetings of the Fanoclasts and FIStFA in New York City) and APA-L (published weekly at LASFS and still ongoing). Even when a special \\"fractional\\" issue of APA-L was produced at a LASFS social event (a \\"Fanquet\\") without telling him, Pelz arrived with a fanzine to contribute, keeping his unbroken string. The only longer unbroken run of participation in APA-L is that of Fred Patten, who contributed every week until January 22, 2009, for 2280 issues. Pelz spent a lifetime assembling one of the greatest privately held fanzine collections, which now is part of the J. Lloyd Eaton Collection at the University of California, Riverside.The Bruce Pelz Fanzine Collection page on the Eaton Collection website Costume Pelz also took part in costume competitions and won several prizes at world and regional conventions, including * Heavy Trooper (from The Dragon Masters by Jack Vance), Westercon, 1963 and again at Worldcon, 1968 * Fafhrd (with Ted Johnstone as the Gray Mouser and Dian as Ningauble of the Seven Eyes, from Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories), Worldcon, 1963 * Gorice of Carce (from The Worm Ouroboros, with his first wife Dian as Lady Sriva), Westercon 1965 and again at Worldcon, 1970. * The Fat Fury (from Herbie Popnecker comics, with Dian as Ticklepuss), Westercon, 1966 * Chun the Unavoidable (from The Dying Earth by Jack Vance), Worldcon, 1966 * Barquentine (from Titus Groan), Westercon, 1967 * Countess Gertrude (from Titus Groan by Mervyn Peake), Worldcon, 1968 * Nick van Rijn (from Poul Anderson's Polesotechnic League stories), Westercon, 1978 Other Pelz was also active in filk music in the 1960s and early 1970s. He wrote several classic filksongs, including musical settings for 3 poems from Silverlock by John Myers Myers, and published The Filksong Manual, originally in four slim volumes, later re-issued as a single volume with added material. In later life, Pelz was best known for his activities in organizing science fiction conventions, sometimes referred to as SMOFFing. He was heavily involved with nearly every convention held in Los Angeles from the mid-60s until his death. Pelz was instrumental in convincing the LASFS to start holding an annual convention, Loscon, and he chaired Loscon X (1983). He co- chaired the 30th World Science Fiction Convention in 1972, with Chuck Crayne. He co-chaired the 1969 Westercon, and served as chair of the 1976 and the 2002 Westercon (his wife Elayne Pelz, also an experienced conrunner, assumed leadership upon his death and the con was held successfully).Westercon History He was Fan Guest of Honor of the 38th World Science Fiction Convention in Boston in 1980. Pelz also lent his time and expertise to conventions held in other cities, even outside of North America. His leadership was instrumental in rescuing the ill-fated 1966 Westercon, Westercon XIX, in San Diego. For many years he drove a car with the license plate \\"SMOF 2\\". Pelz also found time for other projects, including the Fantasy Showcase Tarot. He arranged for 78 artists to paint one Tarot card each, and arranged for the deck to be published. It is still available for sale. The project grew to include four non-standard cards, and several of the original artists had to be replaced because the promised paintings were never delivered, so the list of artists eventually grew to nearly 100.

Life  Maria Bergamas was born on 23 January 1867 in Gradisca d'Isonzo and lived in Trieste, where she had moved in her youth, and where she resided at the outbreak of the World War I. At the time, both Gradisca d'Isonzo and Trieste were an integral part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, so his son Antonio was drafted into the Austrian army. In 1916 Antonio defected, fled to Italy and volunteered in the 137th Infantry Regiment of the Barletta Brigade under the name of Antonio Bontempelli, a false identity imposed by the Royal Italian Army to accommodate the irredentists among his ranks. While leading the attack of his platoon, during a fight at the foot of Monte Cimone di Tonezza, on 16 June 1916, Antonio was joined and killed by a barrage of machine gun. At the end of the battle, a note was found in his pockets in which he begged to inform the mayor of San Giovanni al Natisone, the only person aware of his real identity, of the death. The body of Antonio Bergamas was therefore recognized and buried along with the others who fell in the war cemetery of Marcesina on the Sette Comuni Plateau. However, following a violent bombing that destroyed the cemetery, Bergamas and the comrades who died with him were officially missing. After the war, Maria was commissioned to choose the body of a soldier from eleven bodies of unidentifiable fallen, gathered in different areas of the front. On October 28, 1921, in the Basilica of Aquileia, the woman was placed in front of the eleven coffins lined up: she laid the shawl on the second coffin and, after passing in front of the first, failed to continue the reconnaissance and collapsed on the ground in front of the tenth coffin screaming the name of the son on which, for this reason, the choice fell. The chosen body was placed inside the Monument to the Unknown Soldier at altare della Patria, in memory of the fallen of the war. The solemn ceremony took place on 4 November 1921. According to the testimony of her daughter Anna, the mother was determined to choose the eighth or ninth coffin, since those were the numbers that recalled the birth and death of Antonio; but when she came before the coffins she felt a sense of shame, and since nothing reminded her son, she chose tithing so that the symbol that would go to Rome was indeed an unknown soldier. Maria Bergamas died in Trieste on 22 December 1953 and the following year, on 3 November 1954, the body was exhumed and buried in the war cemetery of Aquileia behind the basilica, near the bodies of the other 10 unknown soldiers.

Early life, education and military service Greene was born in Beckenham, Kent, son of Arthur Werguelin Greene, a solicitor, and his wife Katherine Agnes Fooke. He was educated at Westminster School; he was one of the first Roman Catholic pupils to be admitted to the School. He graduated from Christ Church, Oxford in 1906 with a BA; he had the reputation of being \\"a formidable scholar\\".Ziegler, Philip, Harold Wilson Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1993 p.33 He was admitted to Inner Temple in 1908 entitled to practice as a Barrister-at-Law. He graduated from Christ Church, Oxford in 1912 with an Oxbridge MA. He gained the rank of Captain in the service of the 2/1st Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. He fought in the First World War between 1914 and 1918. He was decorated with the award of the MC in 1918. He was decorated with the award of Cavaliere, Order of the Crown of Italy. He was decorated with the award of Croix de guerre. He was invested with an OBE in 1919. Legal and judicial career Greene was a Lord Justice of Appeal from 1935 to 1937. He served as Master of the Rolls between 1937 and 1949, and subsequently became a Law Lord. On 16 July 1941 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Greene, of Holmbury St Mary in the County of Surrey. The title became extinct on his death in April 1952, aged 68. He married Nancy Wright in 1909. Greene in his time was the acknowledged master of administrative law ‚Äì indeed it is impossible to exaggerate his contribution to the development of this field of law. Despite some refinements, the Wednesbury doctrine of reasonableness [1948] 1 K.B. 223 remains the benchmark by which courts review decisions of public bodies. Of even greater significance was his enunciation of the Carltona doctrine in Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioners of Public Works [1943] 2 All E.R. 560 that \\"the duties imposed upon Ministers and the powers given to Ministers are normally exercised under the authority of the Minister by responsible officials of the Department\\". It may fairly be said that the Carltona doctrine is the legal underpinning for the operation of the civil service in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In 1941 he chaired a Board of Inquiry into pay in the mining industry, prompted by a series of strikes, and at the urging of Harold Wilson (the future Prime Minister, then serving as a wartime civil servant), who served as secretary to the inquiry, recommended both a pay rise and the establishment of a minimum wage for the industry.Ziegler pp.33-4 Greene, who was not normally thought of as a \\"political\\" judge, is said to have remarked cheerfully that his report was the first step towards nationalisation of the coal mines.Ziegler p.34 Joldwynds Greene acquired Joldwynds, a country house in Holmbury St Mary designed by Arts and Crafts architect Philip Webb, but demolished it in 1930. He commissioned Oliver Hill to design a new Joldwynds in modernist style, completed in 1932.

It used to be part of Carbery GAA but moved in the mid-1970s to Carrigdhoun GAA as it felt that it would be offered a higher chance to be able to win county championships, as there are more hurling clubs in the south east division.  Pitches *P√°irc U√≠ Riag√°in, Ballinspittle *Ballinadee Community Field, Ballinadee History Gaelic games in Courcey's date back to the foundations of the Association itself and beyond, but up until the 1940s there were various clubs scattered in the parish ( Old Head, Kilcolman, Old Blues, Castlepark) and then two clubs in the parish from Ballinspittle and Ballinadee. In January 1904, the first official West Cork Board was set up. They ran off the first official West Cork Football Championship. Whereas twelve teams entered the football championship only three of those formed hurling teams, namely Bandon, Clonakilty and Skibbereen. They were joined by newly formed Kilbrittain, Shannonvale, Clogagh and Ballinadee who did not field in football. Of those original seven, Kilbrittain and Ballinadee (Courcey Rovers) have since retained hurling as their primary game. The first draw for the West Cork Hurling Championship (part of the 1904 Championship) took place in January 1905 and resulted as Shannonvale V Clogagh; Ballinadee V Bandon; Clonakilty V Skibbereen; Kilbrittain a bye. Bandon played Ballinadee in Bandon. The game was originally fixed for Kilbrittain but Ballinadee agreed to go to Bandon. However, when they saw the heavy state of the Bandon pitch they at first refused to play and the game was held up for an hour. When it eventually took place, Bandon were far superior, winning 5 ‚Äì 9 to 0 ‚Äì 0. It was, in fact, the first recorded championship hurling game played in West Cork.

When Ballinspittle later entered the hurling arena in the thirties, they were blue and white and became known as \\"The Old Blues\\" Courcey Rovers GAA Club was founded in 1947 when the Ballinspittle and Ballinadee clubs agreed to merge to form one single club. The club met immediate success as in its first year it won the South West Cork Junior A and Junior B Hurling championships. Highlights over the next three decades include winning eight out of eleven South West Hurling titles from 1947 including a Five-In-A-Row and reaching the County Finals of 1957 and 1970. The defeats in those deciders were against Tracton and Cloughduv respectively. In 1974, Courcey's made the major decision and switched from the South West (Carbery) to the South East Division (Carrigdhoun) having won Fifteen Junior A Hurling titles in less than thirty years. This was the cause of much debate at the time, and still is to this day. But Courceys Rover's day eventually came in 2001 when they won the Carrigdhoun Junior Hurling Championship after many long years of trying. Courceys still remain the only club in the SE division to claim the Cork Under-21 Hurling Championship title when they defeated St Finbarrs in 1997. In 2011, after two previous unsuccessful final appearances in eight years, Courcey Rovers finally claimed the County PIHC title and ascended to Senior status for the first time in their history. A tightly fought final encounter with Youghal finished on a scoreline of Courceys 0‚Äì15 Youghal 1‚Äì9. The final whistle was greeted with scenes of great joy, and not a few tears were shed to see this team deliver at last on its massive potential.

Herouni (, December 17, 1933 ‚Äì December 5, 2008) was an Armenian physicist and engineer. He was a member of the Armenian National Academy of Sciences in the fields of radio-physics, radio-engineering, and radio- astronomy and the head of the Antenna Systems chair, which he founded, at the National Polytechnic University of Armenia and Radio Physics Research Institute (RRI). In 1986, he was awarded the USSR State Prize. Biography Herouni was born in Yerevan, Armenia, on December 17, 1933. His father was from Hadjin and a survivor of the Armenian Genocide. Upon completion of his undergraduate studies in Yerevan, Herouni attended the Moscow Power Engineering Institute, where he earned his graduate degree in radio technology in 1957. He earned his doctorate of philosophy in radio techniques from the same institution in 1965. Herouni became an associate professor in 1968 and a full professor in 1983. Because of his many scientific discoveries, Herouni received numerous awards such as: the Order of the Red Banner of Labour, the Silver Medal of Catholicos of All Armenians (given to him by Vazgen I), the State Prize of Soviet Armenia in the field of Science (1985), the Medal \\"Veteran of Labour\\", a Bronze Medal from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France, and the Lomonosov Gold Medal from the Russian Academy of Sciences.Biography at AAS site In addition, Herouni held over 20 patents and published over 340 scientific works, including two monographs during his lifetime. Obituary Scientific works Herouni's scientific discoveries and theories include his theory and calculations on the Method of the Large Double Mirror Antennas with Fixed Spherical Main Mirror, his theory and equations of electromagnetic field diffraction on the apertures of different configurations. He also developed radio holography‚Äîmethods of field determination in space by measurements of complex fields near (NF) emitting or scattering objects. In addition, he created methods of Near-to-Far (NF - FF) measurements of antennas and scattering objects parameters. He created the Theory of Field Diffraction in antenna edges when illuminating the part of the main aperture and Antenna Metrology direction. Among his many experiments are his projected, built, and adjusted equipment which was used for the First Radio-Optical Telescope (ROT-54/2.6)‚Äîthe Herouni Mirror Radio telescope‚Äîthe large antenna of which with a diameter has one of the best parametersObituary among all large antennas in the world. He concluded and built an Antenna Parameters and Phase Shift Angle, being the first 11, based on the World National Primary Standards. The \\"AREV\\" Project, which is a new type of powerful and ecologically pure solar power plant. He was the first to come across the powerful radio-flare on the Eta Geminorum star, a red giant and the powerful flares associated with that type of star. He also was the first to measure an aperture of an antenna, in the World Radio Hologram. Using this, he designed and built many highly, effective automatic complexes of equipment for NF - FF antenna measurement. Other research Later, he turned his attention to megalithic structures, such as Carahunge (sometimes referred to as Zorats Karer) in Armenia. By using four telescopic methods, and the precession laws of Earth, he argued that Zorats Kaher is more than 7,500 years old; dating it to around 5500 BC. According to him, some of the stones mirror the brightest star of the Cygnus constellation‚ÄîDeneb. Herouni wrote about his claims in his 2004 book, Armenians and Old ArmeniaArmenians and old Armenia: archaeoastronomy, linguistics, oldest history (in English), by Paris M. Herouni, Yerevan, Tigran Mets, 2004, 272 p.. Archaeostronomer Clive Ruggles, writing about the site, stated that, \\"Inevitably there have been other claims‚Äîmore speculative and less supportable‚Äîrelating to the astronomical significance of the site. One is that it can be astronomically dated to the sixth millennium B.C.E. And direct comparisons with Stonehenge, which few now believe was an observatory, are less than helpful.\\"Ruggles (2005), pp. 65-67. An overview of ancient astronomy in the Caucasus region briefly discussed Carahunge, citing a preliminary report of a recent survey as evidence that Carahunge indicated astronomical alignments to the Sun, Moon, and selected stars. The authors consider that Carahunge may have been a dual purpose site: a burial place for a significant person and a place for astronomically related ritual. A critical assessment found several problems with the archaeoastronomical interpretations of the site. The northeast avenue, which extends about meters from the center, has been inconsistently associated with the summer solstice, the major northern lunistice, or the rising of Venus. However, this must remain conjectural as the holes are relatively unweathered and may not even be prehistoric in origin. Herouni had postulated that in order to use the holes in the megaliths for astronomical observations sufficiently precise to determine the date of the solstices, it would have been necessary to restrict the field of vision by inserting a narrow tube into the existing perforations. Without these modifications, for which there is no archaeological evidence, the claimed astronomical significance of the orientations of the holes vanishes. As a consequence, Gonz√°lez-Garcia concluded that the archaeoastronomical claims for the site are untenable, although further investigations to determine the astronomical potential of Carahunge and similar sites are merited. Herouni also worked on the AREV-1 which is a 100 kW solar thermal power plant based on heat absorption of reflected sunbeams and rotating a compressor by the heated air to generate power.Renewable energy in the Republic of Armenia, by Vahe Odabashian, Susanna Khachatryan, ¬´21-st CENTURY¬ª journal, ‚Ññ 1 (3), 2008 Publications=in English * Herouni P.

The main plot of the film is the conflict between a Lakota elder and storyteller named Pete Chasing Horse (August Schellenberg) and his Lakota grandson, Shane Chasing Horse (Eddie Spears). The plot unwinds as the two travel from Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota to the All Nations powwow in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a trip the grandson takes only under duress. Along the way, the grandfather tells his grandson various Indian stories and legends to help him understand and choose the \\"good red road,\\" i.e. to embrace an Indian identity. Plot The film opens with Eagle Boy, a young man who is on a vision quest. It then cuts to the present, where a 17-year-old Lakota named Shane Chasing Horse is living on the Pine Ridge reservation. He is in trouble because he owes some money to a local gang‚Äîmoney he used to buy a beautiful ring for Mae Little Wounded, a girl he likes. Meanwhile, his mother asks him to drive his grandfather, Pete Chasing Horse, a storyteller, down to the powwow. Shane is reluctant. However, when the gang comes after him, Shane changes his mind and heads out to the powwow with his grandfather, who agrees to give him his truck once they reach the powwow. Grandfather tells Shane the story of a young Lakota man who tries to win the hand of Bluebird Woman. He also tells the story of how a thunder spirit falls in love with a Mohawk woman and brings her up into the ethereal world of Sky Woman, and of how she raised their son back in her village until he was struck by one of the villagers and brought back to live with his father. Later, when a young redheaded man who is eager to learn about Native culture and hoping to be adopted by a Native American family asks to ride with them to the powwow, Shane says no. His grandfather then tells him the Kiowa story of Tehan, a white man who lived among the Kiowa and fought bravely alongside them, and Shane relents and lets the redhead ride with them. Shane's grandfather then tells how Eagle Boy follows the advice of a shining spirit elk, and seeks out an old woman who can give him weapons with which to slay the mighty serpent Uncegila. He is repulsed when the ugly old woman embraces him, but reacts quite differently when she transforms into a beautiful younger woman. She reproaches him, but gives him what he needs. Eagle Boy slays Uncegila, whose heart instructs him and grants him great power and prophetic visions. Eventually, the gang members who are after Shane catch up with them, but accidentally drive their car off a cliff and into the Rio Grande River while chasing him. Shane dives in and saves them, and his struggle is contrasted with Eagle Boy's underwater battle with Uncegila. The gang members ride with them for a ways, until they and the redheaded hitchhiker leave them in order to travel with a group of attractive young women who are also headed to the powwow. As they travel, Shane's grandfather tells Shane many other stories: several are about the trickster Coyote and Iktomi the spider. Another is about a young Pawnee man and his mother who are scorned by the rest of their tribe until the young man finds an unwanted dun pony who brings them good medicine. As Shane and his grandfather look up at the stars, the grandfather tells the story of the Quillwork Girl and her seven star brothers, which is about a Cheyenne girl who puts her faith in a dream and searches for seven brothers, but who must then contend with the Buffalo nation. The next story is about a young Chinook woman who sacrifices herself in order to cure her village of a terrible sickness, and the next is about a young Blackfoot hunter who cannot let go of the memory of his father. Shane and his grandfather continue their journey, losing their truck along the way and continuing on horseback and on foot. The two become closer. However, it then turns out that Shane's grandfather has led them not to the powwow but to Shane's father's (Sam Chasing Horse) trailer home. Shane is outraged and disappointed to be tricked, but is persuaded to stay the night. The next morning Shane finally makes peace with his estranged father. However, he then becomes grief-stricken when he discovers that his grandfather had meanwhile died in his sleep. Shane decides to continue on to the powwow on horseback, and his father says that when Shane comes home he'll be there too. The ending of Eagle Boy's story is revealed: Eagle Boy decides that he wants to live like other men, and disobeys the heart by revealing it to the entire tribe (to whom it appears to be nothing more than an ordinary stone). At the powwow, Shane takes on the role of a storyteller, and children gather around him to listen.

Representatives of the Lakota, Kiowa, Cheyenne, Pawnee, Blackfeet, Mohawk and Crow tribes came on board the film to evaluate the authenticity of the production during filming and to suggest changes. One of the advisors was shocked to see that the crew had managed to get rare Cheyenne leopard dogs for one scene. Some scenes involved shooting a stampeding herd of 1,500 buffalo. Visual effects supervisor Nicholas Brooks states that in order to create the heavenly, otherworldly look of the land of Sky Woman in the \\"Legend of She Crosses the Water and the Thunder Spirit,\\" the filmmakers decided not to film the actors against blue screen. Instead, the color and texture of the scenes were later altered, sometimes in a rather arbitrary manner controlled by the computer, which Brooks says lent the sequence a particular psychological feel.

It presents scenes from a fictional day in Feynman's life, less than two years before his death, interweaving many strands from his biography, from the Manhattan project to the Challenger disaster inquiry to more personal topics such as the death of Feynman's wife and his own fight with cancer. The play, which grew out of a collaboration between Parnell, actor Alan Alda, and director Gordon Davidson, premiered in 2001. The original production, directed by Davidson and starring Alda as Feynman, was performed first at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and, from late 2001 to mid-2002, on Broadway. Plot Set in June, 1986, fewer than two years before Feynman's death, in Feynman's office at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, the play follows Feynman through a day of his life. As the real Feynman does in his books What Do You Care What Other People Think? and Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!, the stage character talks directly to the audience; we learn from this and from phone calls with off-stage characters that Feynman is to appear that night playing his bongo drums in a student production of the musical South Pacific, that he is expecting a delegation from the Russian Republic of Tuva, which Feynman is whimsically determined to visit (as detailed in Ralph Leighton's book, Tuva or Bust!), and that he is eager to make his views known in the final report of the Rogers Commission charged with the Challenger disaster. From phone conversations between Feynman and his doctors, we also learn that Feynman's cancer has returned, and that his doctors are urging him to undergo further surgical procedures, which are not without their own risk. Feynman's conversation with the audience also touches on a number of additional topics well-known to readers of his autobiographical writings: the Manhattan project and safe-cracking, how he learned to draw, his father, as well as musings on physics and, more generally, on the nature of science and knowledge. In the second act, the play returns to Feynman's study later at night on the same day, after the performance is over. We meet the only other character in addition to the main protagonist: a (fictional) young student by the name of Miriam Field, who has attended one of Feynman's lectures and both witnessed his bongo performance and attended the after-play party. Where Feynman had earlier grown dispirited both by his own condition and by memories of his long-dead wife, Miriam manages to pull him out of his depression. Feynman informs his doctors that he will consent to have surgery, after all; but requests that they awaken him from anesthesia if they determine that he is about to die intraoperatively, because \\"that would be an interesting experience\\". History and productions In the mid-1990s, Alan Alda, having read Feynman's autobiographical books, became intent on playing Feynman on stage. He consulted director Gordon Davidson at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, who suggested that playwright Peter Parnell be the play's author. Over the course of more than six years, the three went through many revisions in their combined effort to bring the many facets of Feynman's character to the stage.Ch. 12 in The play premiered on March 25, 2001, at the Mark Taper Forum.A review is Later that year, the production went to Broadway, where it was performed 40 times between November 18, 2001 and June 20, 2002 at the Vivian Beaumont Theater.IBDB entry Six years later, Alda briefly revisited his role in a scenic reading at Columbia University's Miller Theatre as part of the 2008 World Science Festival, once more directed by Davidson.Event description.

Hibernia as a national personification representing Ireland appeared in numerous cartoon and drawings, especially in the nineteenth century. As depicted in frequent cartoons in Punch, a magazine outspokenly hostile to Irish nationalism, Hibernia was shown as \\"Britannia's younger sister\\". She is an attractive, vulnerable girl. She is threatened by manifestations of Irish nationalism such as the Fenians or the Irish National Land League, often depicted as brutish, ape-like monsters. Unable to defend herself, Hibernia is depicted turning to the strong, armoured Britannia for defence. John Tenniel, now mainly remembered as the illustrator of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, produced a number of such depictions of Hibernia. At times nationalist publications (such as the Land League and Parnell's United Ireland newspaper) did use the image of Hibernia. However, possibly because of the pro-union publications' adoption of the \\"helpless\\" image of Hibernia, nationalist publications would later use Erin and Kathleen Ni Houlihan as personifications of Irish nationhood. (Although Irish Nationalists did continue to use the terms \\"Hibernia\\" and \\"Hibernian\\" in other contexts, such as the Ancient Order of Hibernians). A statue, derived from an original by Edward Smyth and depicting a more confident Hibernia (with harp and spear), stands in the central position of three atop the General Post Office in Dublin. The statue appeared on a ‚Ç¨2 commemorative coin in 2016 to mark the Rising's centenary.https://www.thejournal.ie/new-e2-coin-2557022-Jan2016/ References Category:19th century in Ireland Category:Personifications of Ireland Category:National personifications ","title":"Hibernia (personification)"},{"id":"13377295","text":"ProMedica Defiance Regional Hospital is a public hospital in Defiance, Ohio that is part of the ProMedica Health System.

History WVLK began broadcasting on November 26, 1947 as a Mutual affiliate on 590 kHz with 1 KW power (full-time). It was owned by Bluegrass Broadcasting Company, whose president was former U.S. Senator A.B. Chandler. Offices and studios were in the Lafayette Hotel in Lexington. The station provides at least secondary coverage to most of central Kentucky, as well as parts of the Louisville radio market, and as far south as the Lake Cumberland area. Until sometime in the 1990s, WVLK was the flagship radio station of the University of Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball and football games from the UK Sports Radio Network. In 2015, WVLK signed on a new FM translator station, W266AN in Lawrenceburg, at 101.1 MHz on the FM dial. On June 20, W266AN was forced off the air due to interference with WSGS in the Central Kentucky area. Effective June 13, 2017, the translator was licensed to Lexington at 97.3 FM, as W247CT. Also on Jan 1, 2020, WVLK is now on WCYN FM 102.3 FM. Early voices Among the early voices at WVLK, US Representative Harold Rogers was a disc jockey at the station in 1959, while he was a student at the University of Kentucky. During the period from 1959 through 1963, the DJ 'crew' at WVLK included Arty Kay, Bob McDonald, Jim Chadwick, Sam Combs, Charles Lancaster, Jim Richmond and Darrel Evans. At that time, WVLK was a Top 40 Rock station, and was the highest-rated station in the market, with more listeners than all of the other stations combined (Pulse, Hooper, Nielson ratings).

J. Scannell, American publishing company (c. 1917) Etymology The surname Scannell (Irish: √ì Scannail or √ì Scanaill) derives from the Irish word scannal (Old Irish scandal from Latin scandalum). There were originally three quite distinct septs or clans, the first sept being the √ì Scannail, who belonged to West Munster and specifically the Counties of Cork, Kerry, Limerick, and Clare, with Ballyscanlan in County Clare deriving its name from the sept. The clan of Scannell were a sept of the E√≥ganachta. Scannell was a sept of some significance and it is recorded that in 1014, Eocha, son of Dunadbach, Chief of Clann Scannail, and Scannail son of Cathal, Lord of E√≥ganacht Locha L√©in, were killed at the Battle of Clontarf.Annals of InnisfallenT.M.Charles- Edwards, Early Christian Ireland The E√≥ganachta were an Irish dynasty centred on Cashel which dominated southern Ireland from the 7th to the 10th centuries,√ì Corr√°in 2001, p. 30 and following that, in a restricted form, the Kingdom of Desmond, and its offshoot Carbery, well into the 16th century. By tradition the dynasty was founded by Conall Corc but named after his ancestor √âogan, the firstborn son of the semi-mythological 3rd-century king Ailill Aulom. This dynastic clan-name, for it was never in any sense a 'surname,' should more accurately be restricted to those branches of the royal house which descended from Conall Corc, who established Cashel as his royal seat in the late fifth century.Byrne, F.J., Irish Kings and High Kings, London, 1973, p. 177. . The rule of the E√≥ganachta in Munster is widely regarded as gentle and more sophisticated in comparison with the other provincial dynasties of Ireland. Not only was Munster the wealthiest of the provinces, but the E√≥ganachta were willing to concede other previously powerful kingdoms whom they had politically marginalized, such as the Corcu Lo√≠gde, considerable status and freedom from tribute, based on their former status as rulers of the province. See Byrne 2001 for an extensive description of the kingdom. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of M√°el Patraic Ua Scannail (also called Patrick O'Scannell), and dated 1262 - 1272, when he was Bishop of Raphoe and afterwards of Armagh.

It was designed for the 1936 new fighter contest for the Regia Aeronautica, with practically all the Italian aircraft builders involved. Design The aircraft, designed by the engineer Galasso, was a single-seat, monoplane fighter, of mixed construction (the wings were made of wood), and initially with a fixed undercarriage. The engine was standard for this generation of fighters, an 840 hp Fiat A.74 RC 38 radial powering a three-blade propeller. The fixed undercarriage, meant that the maximum speed was only 467 km/h. It was armed with two Breda-SAFAT 12.7 mm machine guns. Development On June 1938 the first prototype, initially fitted with a very small tail, was tested and found inferior to the Macchi C.200 and Fiat G.50. It was overall a poor aircraft. The trials to re-engineer the wing came too late and no orders were made. The second prototype Ro.51/1, was converted into a fighter floatplane. Like the Ro.44 it had a large central float and two smaller ones under the wings. The maximum speed dropped to 430 km/h, but endurance was increased to 1,200 km. Unfortunately during a trial one of the wings suddenly sank in the water. The rest of the aircraft swiftly followed, and the loss of this prototype meant the end of the program.

It is designated U.S. Route 50 (US 50) for its entire length and is part of the National Highway System. Arlington Boulevard serves to bisect Arlington County into its northern and southern sections in popular parlance and for designation of street directional affixes according to the county's street-naming system. Route description Arlington Boulevard begins in the east at an interchange with Interstate 66, Virginia State Route 110, and the George Washington Memorial Parkway (I-66 Exit 75) at the foot of the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge over the Potomac River to Washington, DC. It proceeds westward soon turning south along the edge of Fort Myer army post. Most of the junctions in this section are grade-separated interchanges. At an interchange with Washington Boulevard (VA 27), the road turns west again and continues in that direction for the remainder of its length. Arlington Boulevard has interchanges with VA 120 (Glebe Road) in Arlington County and VA 7 (Leesburg Pike)/VA 338 (Hillwood Avenue)/SR 613 (Wilson Boulevard) at Seven Corners and I-495 (Capital Beltway) in Fairfax County. It terminates just inside Fairfax City at a traffic circle with US 29 (Lee Highway and Fairfax Boulevard) and Old Lee Highway. VA 237, which arrives at the circle as Lee Highway concurrent with US 29, also concurs with US 50 on Arlington Boulevard for less than 1/3 mile before turning south onto Pickett Road. History Arlington Boulevard has a shorter history than many other major arterial roads in the region and was only built in the first half of the 20th century in several stages beginning in the west and progressing east. The entire route was complete in 1938 with the final section around Fort Myer. The road was originally called Lee Boulevard but, with Lee Highway being another major route in Northern Virginia, the name was changed to Arlington Boulevard in the early 1950s. Between 1935-37, the US 50 designation was attached to the road even though it had yet to be completed past Glebe Road, then VA 9. Before that, the road was VA 236, a number now assigned to the nearby Little River Turnpike. The completed Arlington Boulevard's eastern terminus was originally the crossing of the George Washington Memorial Parkway on Columbia Island in the District of Columbia. With the completion of the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge in 1964, Arlington Boulevard's terminus was moved to its present location. Arlington Boulevard Trail The Arlington Boulevard Trail is a set of discontinuous trails and on-road bike routes, 11 miles in length, on both sides of Arlington Boulevard. The trail runs from N. Rhodes Street in Arlington County to Fairview Park Drive in Falls Church. It has been proposed that the trail be extended to Pickets Road in Fairfax Virginia. The trail opened on November 18, 1974, in conjunction with preferential bus lanes, as a 1.7 mile long, paved trail between the Four Mile Run Trail and North Pershing Drive in Arlington. It was Arlignton's 2nd Trail. By 1976, the trail had been extended west with another 2.3 miles. In May 1979, the trail was extended east from its endpoint at North Pershing, around Fort Myer to Arlington Memorial Bridge. In 2014, a new segment was built from N. Pershing to Rolfe street on the east side of Arlington Boulevard, and the old section over the same stretch was widened and extended under 10th Street, closing a gap in the trail. In 2017, the short section from Wainwright Road to Washington Boulevard was repaved as part of a Washington Gas Pipeline Replacement Project. In January of 2020 the Gables apartment community, which had been under construction since 2017, opened and one of the street space improvements included was a widening of the ~500 feet of trail between Rolfe and Rhodes street from 5 feet to 10 feet with 5 feet of green space.

Ricordi studied the violin from an early age and, for a short time, became the concertmaster and conductor of the small puppet theatre Fiando. In 1803 he created a in Milan where he worked as a music copyist and dealer in printed music and instruments with the Teatro Carcano, which opened in that year, and with the Teatro Lentasio. In 1807 he studied in Leipzig at the Breitkopf & H√§rtel company to learn the techniques of engraving and printing. When he returned to Milan in early 1808, he founded his publishing company with a partner who dropped out by the middle of the year. As MacNutt notes, during its first decade the company produced some 30 publications each year. That number increased to 300 after 1814 because Giovanni had secured a succession of contracts, including one in that year which allowed him to publish all the music performed at the La Scala opera house, a contract won due to his work as a prompter and exclusive copyist.Macnutt 1998, p. 1317 As he began to acquire a stock of manuscripts from existing theatres and copyists, he added a clause in his contracts which allowed, at the end of a run of performances of an opera, for the company to acquire the rights to it for successive presentations elsewhere. The contracts allowed the company to assemble a significant catalogue of music which became the basis of the Ricordi company. It was through the gradual accession to the rights to control La Scala's archives, as well as subsequently-produced operas, that he was able to bypass the limitations on publishing full scores, and‚Äîas Gossett notes‚Äî\\"not be its employee but a private entrepreneur from whom theatres rented materials\\". In contrast, many of Ricordi's competitors produced \\"hackwork manuscripts\\" in no way based on the composers' autographs.Gossett 1996, pp. 98‚Äî99 By the 1840s and throughout that decade, Casa Ricordi had grown to be the largest music publisher in southern Europe and in 1842 the company created the musical journal the Gazzetta Musicale di Milano. His adopted practices radically changed the music publishing market, ensuring that composers received revenues not only at the time they delivered the composition, but also for the subsequent productions mounted elsewhere. In 1825 he acquired all the manuscripts belong to the Teatro alla Scala, and began to circulate handwritten copies intended for rental, which alongside the sale of the reductions for soloists and piano, produced another level of demand. In addition, Ricordi's use of new techniques such as lithography and intaglio printing, he was able to reduce costs and increase the print runs. Finally, the company produced vocal scores and then complete scores. Ricordi befriended many major Italian operatic composers of his time, including Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti and Verdi whose works he published. Ricordi's correspondence with Verdi is studied to gain a full insight into the latter's activities. Ricordi died on 15 March 1853 in Milan.
